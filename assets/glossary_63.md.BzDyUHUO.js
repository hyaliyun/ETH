Tansaekhwa means ‚Äòmonochrome painting‚Äô in Korean and was used by the critic Lee Yil in 1980 to refer to a group of largely non-figurative paintings painted in neutral hues. Promoted in Seoul, Tokyo, and Paris, Tansaekhwa grew to be the international face of contemporary Korean art and a cornerstone of contemporary Asian art. Figures associated with Tansaekhwa include: Cho Yong-ik, Chung Chang-Sup, Chung Sang-Hwa, Ha Chonghyun, Heu Hwang, Kim Guiline, Kwon Young-woo, Lee Dong Youb, Lee Ufan, Park Seobo, Suh Seung-Wong, and Yun Hyong-keun. History Lee Ufan had moved to Japan in 1956, where he established himself with the Mono-ha movement in the late 1960s. In the mid-1970s he introduced his Korean peers to the Tokyo art scene. ‚ÄúFive Korean Artists, Five Kinds of White,‚Äù a group show held at Tokyo Gallery in May 1975, is often credited as the first major presentation of the works that later became known as Tansaekhwa. The five featured artists were Kwon Young-woo, Lee Dong Youb, Heu Hwang, Suh Seung-won and Park Seobo. Recent attention In 2013, the first extended scholarly discussion of Tansaekhwa, written by Joan Kee, was published by the University of Minnesota Press. It was a finalist for the annual College Art Association Charles Rufus Morey Prize for the most distinguished book in the history of art, the first book on any aspect of modern and contemporary Asian art to receive this designation. Starting in 2014, a spate of survey shows in Korea and the United States triggered renewed critical and commercial interest in Dansaekhwa.

Built in 1868, it is believed to be the state's and probably the nation's oldest surviving savusauna (smoke sauna). Moved on several occasions throughout its history, the sauna is now stands with other historical Finnish American structures in a rural park. History Sauna had been practiced for centuries in Finland, and Finnish immigrants to the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did not want to leave sauna behind. Often the first structure they built on their new rural property was a sauna, which they could live and bathe in while they built their other farm buildings. That was the case with the Barberg‚ÄìSelv√§l√§‚ÄìSalmonson Sauna. Finns first came to the Cokato area in 1865, looking for available farmland. Three Finnish families‚Äîthe Barbergs (also known as the Barbas), Selv√§l√§s, and Salmonsons‚Äîwere among the town's earliest settlers, moving onto their adjoining homesteads by 1868. That year, the families agreed to build a shared savusauna along the property line between the Barberg and Selv√§l√§ farms. Traditionally sauna occurred at least once a week, often on Saturday nights, throughout the year. The simple savusauna was a wood building with a hearth inside. The hearth was covered with rocks that could be heated to great temperatures. Also inside was a wooden platform for bathers to sit or lie on, near the roof to maximize the savusauna's heat. Steps and a lower bench were available for those who did not want the maximum temperature. A fire burned in the savusauna's hearth during the day and then was put out, allowing the smoke in the sauna to dissipate before bathing. The hearth's heated rocks kept the sauna warm for hours after the fire was put out and provided heat for the bathing that followed. Sauna users like the Barbergs, Selv√§l√§s, and Salmonsons sat in the structure long enough to sweat and then cooled off by going outside or rinsing with cold water or snow, if available. They would repeat the process as needed. Bathers also used whisks made of flexible birch branches to beat and stimulate the skin, which caused cleansing through exfoliation. Non-Finns in Cokato and elsewhere were unfamiliar with sauna. They did not know what their Finnish neighbors were doing in sauna buildings, which looked to them like strange little huts, and there was great speculation. Adding to the controversy was the standard practice of taking sauna and cooling off naked, often outside in the air if the sauna did not have a separate dressing room, which many early Minnesota savusaunas did not. The Barberg-Selv√§l√§-Salmonson sauna was one of these, so the families cooled themselves in the fresh air, naked. This was fine when their property was remote, but it caused quite a stir as Cokato grew and one of the major town roads was laid out along the Barberg-Selvala property line, right next to the sauna. In 1885 the controversy over the Barberg‚ÄìSelv√§l√§‚ÄìSalmonson sauna went to court. Members of the community accused the Selv√§l√§ family, who had bought the Barberg and Salmonson families out of their shares of the sauna by then, of strange religious or other practices related to their sauna use. The Selv√§l√§s proved to the court that they were upstanding citizens and good Lutherans, and that they were just using the sauna to get clean; they won $30 in damages for the accusations made against them. However the Selv√§l√§s were ordered by the court to move their sauna to a more private location on their property, away from the road. They were given an additional $40 to do so. Nils Selv√§l√§ moved the sauna, but used it from then on as a shed, taking the money his family had won in court to build a bigger, nicer sauna elsewhere on their property. In 1979 the original 1868 savusauna, which had been moved a number of times since the 1880s, was moved one last time to Cokato's Temperance Corner, named for the Cokato Temperance Hall that has stood there since 1896. The original savusauna became one of a group of buildings celebrating the Finnish heritage of many in the region, and now it is cared for by the Cokato Finnish American Historical Society. In 2008 the savusauna was repaired and fully restored to its original appearance.

The film follows an American family who move into an Irish mansion haunted by a multitude of ghosts. The film screened on Showtime as part of the Roger Corman Presents series. Plot Two maids are sent to clean Glen Abbey Manor, a remote estate in Ireland, and encounter several frightening occurrences. One of the maids is attacked by rats and attempts to flee in her car, which inexplicably explodes. Some time later, married American couple Will and Maura South, along with their daughter, Aubrey, move into Glen Abbey after Maura inherits it from a relative. Their marriage has been in crisis after Will, a writer, was unfaithful to Maura. Almost immediately after moving in, the family are plagued by various odd occurrences, such as disembodied voices, and Will's computer crashing. On their first night, Aubrey is attacked by a monstrous apparition in her room, which vanishes. Terrified, Will and Maura consult Edward Shea, a self- proclaimed clairvoyant, to investigate the home. During an investigation with his assistant, Amy, Edward has a vision of a woman being sexually assaulted by a dismembered hand. Amy searches public death records on her computer and finds records of the Laundrigans, a family who resided in the home in the late 19th-century. James Laundrigan, the father, died of pneumonia, while his wife Marion committed suicide in the house; no death certificate exists for their daughter, Colleen. Maura is disturbed by this news, as Aubrey has mentioned the name Colleen, which she has attributed to one of her toy dolls. Dick and Amy investigate the house's cellar, where Will discovered an amulet showing runic symbols. Behind a brick wall, they uncover Colleen's remains, who was apparently murdered by her mother. After Colleen is given a proper burial, Will and Maura invite Edward, Amy, and Father Seamus, the local parish priest, over for dinner. In her bedroom, Aubrey witnesses the apparition of a nun; meanwhile, during the dinner downstairs, Will, Maura, and their guests are violently attacked by a poltergeist, which shatters the windows and throws knives and utensils at them. Edward flees outside, and Will and Maura subsequently find his decapitated body on the ground, his severed head lying on a ledge above the doorway, beneath a gargoyle brandishing a scythe. When Will and Maura attempt to recover Aubrey from her bedroom, they find a bright light emanating from the room, and Aubrey missing. Father Seamus explains that he placed the amulet in the basement of the home, and their disturbing of it unleashed supernatural energy, which was conjured by James and Marion Laundrigan, whom he claims practised black magic there. After Father Seamus completes a ritual, they discover Aubrey trapped behind the wall where Colleen's remains were found, and break it down to save her. After Father Seamus and Amy leave, Maura confronts Will, accusing him of having affection for Amy, which he denies. That night, Maura has a dream of Will taunting her while having sex with Amy. The following morning, as the family prepares to leave to return to California, Maura has a vision of Will having sex with Amy on the family car. Convinced the encounter actually occurred, she locks him out of the house and seals herself inside with Aubrey. Apparently possessed, Maura locks Aubrey in her bedroom. Will goes to consult Father Seamus at the church, but finds him dead, kneeling at the altar. Meanwhile, Aubrey witnesses an apparition of Colleen before Maura attacks her with a cleaver. Will returns to the house, armed with a dagger left by Father Seamus, and manages to break inside, where he is attacked by Maura, armed with the cleaver and knives. Will wrests Maura to the ground before stabbing her in the chest with the dagger. After, a beam of light emanates from the wound, and Maura awakens, healed and restored to her former self. The house suddenly begins to crumble around the three and they flee outside, where they witness it burst into flames. Cast Reception Caryn James of The New York Times said the film has \\"a few effectively scary moments, but it's more like a cut-rate version of The Exorcist than a real Roger Corman film.

TV Guide awarded it two out of five stars, noting it as \\"an efficient shocker that should please fans of the genre, despite the fact that it offers nothing that hasn't been seen in dozens of similar films.

Released on 21 March 2003, the album consists of material composed by members Wally de Backer and Kris Schroeder. The album features De Backer, Schroeder, and original lead guitarist Michael Hubbard.  Background  Wally de Backer and Kris Schroeder met in March 2002, in Melbourne, at the going- away party of engineer/producer Chris O'Ryan. The pair jammed instrumentally alongside several others at that party, and took notice of one another. Subsequently, they became acquainted, and learned of their shared love for the rock and roll music of the 1950s and 60s, particularly that of the Beatles. Schroeder invited De Backer to join him in a musical group - \\"At the time, I was playing a gig down in Frankston, and I needed someone to come and join me on another instrument\\", Schroeder said in 2003. Schroeder and De Backer first rehearsed together at Schroeder's house, and had not heard one another sing prior to this. Upon being asked if he could sing, De Backer said that he could try - he sang Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Long as I Can See the Light\\", greatly impressing Schroeder. Since the dissolution of his first band Downstares, De Backer had scarcely played drums for a period of three years; his attention had been focused on sampling and creating music for his Gotye project. De Backer took up the drums once again in order to play in his new band alongside Schroeder, who played acoustic guitar. At this stage, the band's live set consisted of cover songs. In this early period, they played gigs in Melbourne venues, including Frankston club The Opposition. The duo played their first show here on 29 March 2002, and were paid $50 each for four 40 minute sets in one night. Another of the band's first ongoing gigs was at the House of Fools in Footscray infamous for its rough inhabitants; the duo played there for four hours each Wednesday night for $25 each. During these early gigs, the enthusiastic audience response for immediate, energetic rock and roll songs such as their cover of the Spencer Davis Group's \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" made a distinct impression on the pair. Schroeder and De Backer's musical group initially went under the name The Big Nothing, which was then changed to The Big Something. The name 'The Basics' was the invention of Schroeder, who recalls it \\"coming to [him] while in the shower\\", vaguely inspired by the musical simplicity of their act, with only two instruments and two voices. Soon after the duo's initial formation, Schroeder wrote \\"What Have You Done?\\", a midtempo rock and roll song. The lyrics detail the protagonist learning of his partner's deceit and reckless drunken behaviour, and presenting her with an ultimatum - \\"I won't play your games if you won't change your ways\\". De Backer remarked in 2003 that based on Schroeder's writing of this song, the pair made the decision that they would continue in this musical style. Early in the band's existence, De Backer wrote \\"You're Already Gone\\" - the song, in the time signature of 6/8, describes a relationship in which the woman constantly leaves the protagonist returning again when in need. Another composition, \\"Karolina\\", was a collaboration between Schroeder and De Backer. According to Schroeder, it began as his own composition, but was finished and organised into its final form with the help of his bandmate. During this early period of March-November 2002, The Basics also recorded tape demos including covers of \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\", Prince's \\"Kiss\\", Schroeder composition \\"A Night Inside Your Mind\\", and Schroeder and De Backer's first ever joint composition, \\"I'll Never Love Again\\". In November 2002, Schroeder and De Backer met fellow musician Michael Hubbard - The Basics and Hubbard were both performing at a venue on the same night. Their meeting would result in Hubbard's being invited to join the group as lead guitarist. According to Schroeder, Hubbard's involvement in the group was \\"essentially a temporary arrangement from the start ... Michael always had plans to do more solo stuff\\". After Hubbard joined the band, Schroeder permanently became the band's bass guitarist. According to De Backer, the first songs which the three learned together and arranged for the three-piece band were \\"What Have You Done?\\", \\"It's Over\\", and \\"Can You Trust Me?\\", all written by Schroeder. While \\"It's Over\\" deals with a relationship which the singer feels must end, \\"Can You Trust Me?\\" describes the joy of a new romance; the protagonist professes, however, that he has been known to \\"play around\\", and hopes, with some apparent uncertainty, that he is capable of faithfulness. The Basics, now with three members, were highly productive in late 2002 and early 2003, playing further gigs, and recording more material for potential release, much of which was newly written by Schroeder and De Backer. In late 2002, the Basics had two recording sessions with engineer Michael McClintock - the result of these sessions was a four-track EP consisting of \\"What Have You Done?\\", \\"It's Over\\", \\"Can You Trust Me?\\", and \\"Better\\". The former three of these four songs would eventually appear in re-recorded form on \\"Get Back\\" in March 2003, whereas \\"Better\\" was shelved for unknown reasons, and would not be utilised by the band until 2007, on their second album, \\"Stand Out/Fit In\\". By this point, the song's arrangement had been altered somewhat, with the key lowered by three semitones, and the three-part vocal harmonies reduced to two parts. The early recording was eventually released on the 2013 rarities compilation, \\"Leftovers\\". \\"Did I Ever Stand a Chance\\", another Schroeder composition, served as an opportunity for Hubbard to take on lead vocal duties. In 2003, Hubbard commented with amusement on the fact that he almost always failed to remember the lyrics correctly, despite the song being in the band's live repertoire for several months. Throughout the song, De Backer and Schroeder sing backing vocals, serving as something of a Greek chorus, commenting on the lead singer's predicament - \\"He needs an answer\\". During the months prior to the release of the band's debut album, Hubbard at one point embarked on a brief solo tour, while Schroeder and De Backer continued writing material. Schroeder wrote \\"Gone... Gone... Gone...\\", a song which he describes as a \\"50's dance-hall ballad\\", in which the singer tells of remorse over infidelity, and laments his broken relationship. \\"Lovin' Man\\" was also composed at this time - written by Schroeder, the song is lyrically simplistic, and musically embedded in country and rockabilly stylings. Schroeder intended for Hubbard to sing \\"Lovin' Man\\"'s lead vocal, though Schroeder would ultimately do so himself. Schroeder also composed \\"Hey C'mon\\", which would ultimately become the closing track for \\"Get Back\\" - the song, in which Schroeder sings of a rewarding and happy relationship, was written \\"in about five minutes in the car\\". Further new material included De Backer's \\"I Don't Need Another\\", in which the singer pleads a love interest, whom he has wronged in the past, for another chance at a relationship. At one stage, Schroeder had \\"not written anything for ages\\", while De Backer was continuing to create songs. Anxious to generate more of his own material, Schroeder borrowed the general structure and lyrical framing from the Beatles' \\"She Loves You\\", and wrote \\"She's Gonna B. Late\\". Like in \\"She Loves You\\", the singer is a third party to a relationship, relaying information from the woman to the man - \\"I got a call from your girlfriend - she told me to tell you she's coming to the party tonight\\". Another song contributed by De Backer was \\"I Could Go On\\". The song's subject matter is not unlike that of \\"You're Already Gone\\" - in each song, the singer describes his frustration at a lover's indecisive ways. \\"I Could Go On\\" also provides strong juxtaposition against \\"Gone... Gone... Gone...\\" - in \\"I Could Go On\\", De Backer resolves, \\"I will survive even after you're gone\\", while in \\"Gone... Gone... Gone...\\", Schroeder declares that he cannot go on without his lover. The earliest known video footage of the band performing together originates from this period, shortly before the release of Get Back. The footage was recorded to accompany a video 'interview', in which the band answer questions prepared by themselves. The resulting seven minute mini-documentary was later released as a bonus component alongside the original 2003 release of Get Back - it includes snippets of the band performing renditions of each song from the album, with exception of \\"I Could Go On\\". For this performance, De Backer plays a simplified drum kit using brush sticks, and Schroeder and Hubbard each play acoustic guitars. The video ends with a brief a cappella rendition of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Proud Mary\\", sung in three-part harmony. Recording and Release The recording of Get Back took place over four days. The band acted as their own producers for the recording sessions, while Michael McClintock and William Bowden served as Balance Engineer and Mastering Engineer respectively. The album was mostly recorded live, with occasional overdubs including additional percussion and handclaps. De Backer, Hubbard, and Schroeder were also joined by John Zutic, who contributed piano parts for \\"I Could Go On\\", \\"Gone... Gone... Gone...\\", and \\"You're Already Gone\\". After recording was completed, two days were spent mixing, and then mastering was completed in just three hours. The photograph used for the album's original artwork was taken during one of the recording sessions - \\"a camera belonging to Hubbard was set to a 15-second timer while the boys quickly huddled together, smiling furiously at the lens\\". By the time of Get Back's release, the group were highly experienced as live performers; De Backer and Schroeder had played over one hundred shows together since coming together almost a year prior. The album's title is an oblique reference to the Beatles' aborted 1969 album of the same name, which ultimately became Let It Be. Much like in the case of that abandoned Beatles album, the meaning behind the title Get Back is one of return to straightforward, energetic rock and roll. In terms of typeface and layout, the album artwork for the original 2003 release of Get Back closely emulated that of the Beatles' debut Please Please Me, and by extension, the proposed artwork for the Beatles' Get Back, which was itself to be an imitation of Please Please Me's cover art. The artwork reads, \\"The Basics - Get Back - with I Could Go On and 11 other songs\\", much like the artwork for Please Please Me advertises \\"Love Me Do and 12 other songs\\". Without management or a record label, The Basics were only capable of a limited release, manufacturing and selling 1000 CDs. In 2013, the Basics recorded an acoustic version of \\"I Don't Need Another\\" at the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra, using a 1903 Edison Standard D model wax cylinder. 2008 Reissue Get Back saw a much more widespread re-release via MGM Distribution on 2 August 2008, being mass-produced for physical sale, as well as being made available on online platforms iTunes and Bandcamp. The audio was remastered, and the artwork was replaced by a more professionally shot photograph which had been taken two months after the original 2003 release, in anticipation of a potential reissue. In July and August 2008, the Basics undertook a tri-state tour in support of the album's relaunch. Hubbard was not present for these shows, having departed the band four years prior; Tim Heath had permanently filled the role of lead guitarist since then. The tour's setlists drew heavily on the album's material, as well as covers from the band's early repertoire such as \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\". Track listing All songs credited to Schroeder-De Backer.

Information on the epidemiology of causes of disabilities in Pakistan is limited. Disabilities in Pakistan are seen different than in most Western countries, they are related with cultural and religious beliefs. Demographics The 5th Population and Housing Census conducted in 1998 identified the population of Persons with Disabilities in Pakistan to be 2.38% of the entire population. However, as per the 6th Population and Housing Census of 2017, the percentage has gone down to less than 0.48%. The drastic decline in the population percentage has raised concerns in some circles, Supreme Court of Pakistan being amongst them: \\"the court expressed its displeasure that Pakistan Bureau of Statistics continued citing various issues for not counting disabled persons after the census had already begun across the country.\\" If it were not for the Supreme Court of Pakistan's intervention, the disability question would not even be made part of the survey at a later stage. The Bureau itself accepted that census might not be thorough, an official stated: \\"that there was a possibility that the number of transgender and disabled persons had not been shown in complete detail.\\" Some stakeholders also follow the figure of 15% identified by World Health Organization. As per WHO, \\"About 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability.\\" Using this figure, British Council estimated the population of Persons with Disabilities to be around 27 million in their 2017 report. Moreover, in 2011 Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund undertook a comprehensive survey of 23 union councils in seven districts of Pakistan, comprising 78939 households, and found the disability prevalence rate to be around 12 percent, of which 2 percent had severe disabilities. Recognized Disabilities Recognized disabilities are listed in Schedule [Section 2(h)] of the Sindh Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities Act of 2018.http://www.sindhlaws.gov.pk/setup/Publications/PUB-18-000046.pdf 1. Physical disabilities A) Locomotor disability It means the inability to move the limbs. It's the disability of the legs (generally bones and joints) that causes problem in a person‚Äôs movements (like walking). It includes: a. Due to accident/trauma/disaster: It means people who suffered road accidents, went through a traumatic event or natural/ man-made disasters including earthquakes, floods, building collapse etc.; b. Cerebral palsy: It is a group of permanent movement disorders that usually appear before, during or after birth. It caused by the damage that occurs to an immature and developing brain. It hinders the body‚Äôs ability to move in a coordinated way. c. Muscular dystrophy: It is a group of diseases that cause weakness and loss of muscle mass. It is due to the interference of abnormal genes with the production of proteins needed to form healthy muscle. d. Polio related Physical Disabilities: It is also called poliomyelitis which is caused by the poliovirus. It may affect the spinal cord causing muscle weakness and paralysis. B) Visual Impairment a) Blindness is a condition when there is: i. total absence of sight. ii. visual acuity less than 3/60 or less than 10/200 (Snellen) in the better eye with best possible correction; or iii. limitation of the field of vision subtending an angle of less than 10 degree. b) Low vision is a condition when there is: i. visual acuity not exceeding 6/18 or less than 20/60 up to 3/60 or up to 10/200 (Snellen) in the better eye with best possible corrections; or ii. limitation of the field of vision subtending an angle of less than 40 degree up to 10 degrees. C) Hearing impairment a) Deaf means when a person is having 70 DB hearing loss in speech frequencies in both ears; b) Hard of hearing means a is having a loss between 60 DB to 70 DB in speech frequencies in both ears; 2. Neuro- Developmental Disorders It refers the impairments of the growth and development of the brain or central nervous system. Its basically a disorder of brain function that affects emotion, learning ability, self-control and memory. The effects of it unfold as a person grows and tend to last for a person‚Äôs entire lifetime. a) Intellectual disabilities involves problems with general mental abilities that affect intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem solving) and adaptive functioning (daily life activities which cover social and practical skills). b) Autism Spectrum Disorder means a neuro-developmental condition typically appearing in the first three years of life that significantly affects a person's ability to communicate, understand relationships and relate to others, and is frequently associated with unusual or stereotypical rituals or behaviors and sensory issues; c) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) means a chronic condition marked by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and sometimes impulsivity. It develops in initial years of life and lasts for a lifetime. d) Specific learning disorder is a type of disorder that affects a child‚Äôs ability to acquire and apply reading, writing and math skills. it begins during school age and may not be recognized until adulthood. It includes conditions such as perceptual disabilities, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia and developmental aphasia; e) Communication disorder affects a person‚Äôs ability to comprehend, detect, or apply language and speech while communicating with others. These include Language Disorder (Receptive and Expressive), Speech Sound Disorder, Fluency Disorder, Social Communication Disorder etc. f) Syndromes: These include Down Syndrome, Angelman‚Äôs Syndrome, Tourette‚Äôs Syndrome, Retts Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome etc. 3. Disabilities caused due to chronic neurological conditions i. Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the brain and the spinal cord. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerve fibers and this results in communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. With time, the disease can cause permanent damage of the nerves.; ii. Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system that affects the nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine. This causes muscle rigidity, impaired posture and balance, tremors and change in speech. iii. Dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease refers to a group of diseases in which healthy nerve cells stop working, lose connection with other cells in brain and die. This result in loss of cognitive functioning i.e. thinking, remembering and reasoning. Alzheimer‚Äôs is a very specific form of dementia. iv. Multiple Disabilities means more than one of the above specified disabilities causing severe communication, developmental, social and educational problems. Major Issues 1. Driving Licensing for the Deaf Acquiring driving Licenses has long been an important issue for the Deaf Community. As per the official community released by the Deaf and Mute Community during a protest: ‚ÄúWe have been holding demonstrations for the last 10 years, government is unwilling to accept our demands. Driving licenses should be issued to the deaf.‚Äù https://tribune.com.pk/story/1858613/1-deaf-mute-people-hold-demonstration- get-driving-licence-karachi/ Promises have been made by the authorities several times to issue driving licenses to the Deaf but it has never materialized.https://tribune.com.pk/story/1314380/first-licences-issued- hearing-impaired/ The government of Sindh recently announced that driving licences will be issued to people with hearing disabilities, as the provincial cabinet has approved the issuance of it. 2. Inaccessibility As per a report published by British Council, 72% of Persons with Disabilities reported inaccessibility as a major barrier to access education, training & employment. Not only this, Persons with Disabilities also faced issues during General Elections and could not exercise their right to vote because of inaccessible polling station. Education There are 531 special schools in Pakistan and about 200 non-governmental organizations and disabled people's organizations offering education to people with disabilities. Employment As per British Council‚Äôs report Moving from the margins: Mainstreaming persons with disabilities in Pakistan (2014), PWDs tend to have poorer health outcomes, lower education achievements, higher rates of poverty, and less economic participation. These conditions ultimately exclude PWDs as productive members of society; some estimates suggest the cost of exclusion leads to annual loss of US$11.9bn-15.4bn, or 4.9-6.3% of Pakistan‚Äôs GDP. Employment quotas have been in place for Persons with Disabilities since 1981 when a figure was 2% was set up by the government.http://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1423974101_958.pdf Currently, the employment quotas are as follows: Sindh 5%, Punjab 3%, KPK 3% and Balochistan 5%. The government of Sindh‚Äôs Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities hosted a session with the assistance of a local NGO NOWPDP where the current head of the Department Syed Qassim Naveed Qamar highlighted the steps the government was taking to employ persons with disabilities. The government, he said, \\"was rigorously working for accessibility and transport and also accommodating persons with intellectual disabilities along with other disabilities.\\" Policy Pakistan is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, having signed the treaty on 25 September 2008 and ratified it on 5 July 2011.

Fort Somba Opu (Makassarese Baruga Somba Opu, Indonesian Benteng Somba Opu) was a fortified commercial center of the Gowa Sultanate. Its ruins are located in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The fort was the center of the Gowa Sultanate in the 16th-century until its destruction by the Dutch East India Company in 1669. The conquest of Somba Opu citadel was one of the most difficult campaigns the Company had ever undertaken in the East. History Somba Opu grew on one of the two oldest area in Makassar, the Kale Gowa (Tamalate) and the Tallo'. The Kale Gowa was located on elevated ground on the north bank of the Jeneberang River, around six kilometers from its mouth. Both areas feature walls which encompass a very large area; the perimeter totals about two kilometers. Within the walls were sacred coronation stone on which new rulers (karaeng) took their oaths of office, a sacred spring, and the tombs of the rulers. Many Chinese and Sawankhalok porcelain were discovered around these sites, possibly from the 16th century. For Kale Gowa, the walls were built by King Tumapa'risi' Kallonna (1512‚Äì1548) In the 16th century, the karaeng Tunipalangga (1548‚Äì1566) gave permission to the Malay merchants to establish a trading port in the port of Makassar. They were allocated a site at Mangallekana, on the coast just south of Jeneberang river. The area quickly became a trade center, which is confirmed by the title of the Shahbandar (port master) of that period, I Daeng ri Mangallekana. The importance of this Malay fort means that a new capital is required near the trade center. So Tunipalangga instructed the construction of a new fortress to the north bank of Jeneberang river, about a kilometer away from the mouth of the Jeneberang at that time. Somba Opu became the heart of Makassar during the long duumvirate of Sultan Alauddin of Gowa Kingdom and Karaeng Matoaya of Tallo Kingdom (1590‚Äì1637). During their reign, there are another additional brick forts around Makassar: at Tallo', at Panakukkang just south of the Jeneberang mouth, and at Ujung Pandang, which later became the Fort Rotterdam; all of these were built to prepared Makassar against the expected Dutch attack in 1615. Somba Opu was the commercial capital of Makassar, while the old Gowa was a ceremonial center for inaugurations or burials. In the 1630s, kings and nobles established their residence in Somba Opu, staying in a house built on thick pillars. According to Dutch maps drawn on a model from the 1630s, a number of detached houses were located in the rear (east) and northern side of the fort. They were grouped around the royal complex in the southwest side of Somba Opu, which consisted of two enormous wooden palaces, storehouses, and a mosque. Outside Somba Opu fort were two major markets each to the north and south, and houses of the commoners. The quarters of the Portuguese, the Indians, and some European factories were located along the north coast. remnants of the western wall. Destruction of Somba Opu began with the signing of the Bungaya Treaty in 1667 between the Sultanate and the Dutch, and the subsequent war in 1669. Attack of the fort began with Cornelis Speelman, admiral of the VOC, gathering forces which consisted of 2,000 Bugis soldier, the archrival of Gowa, plus additional 572 men from Ternate, Tidore, Bacan, Butung, and Pampanga (from northern Luzon in the Philippines), 83 Dutch soldiers and 11 Dutch sailors. Speelman divided the Bugismen into six separate entities, among these were those under the command of Arung Palakka, a Bugis prince. Arung Palakka and his retinues were commanded to clear the eastern side of Somba Opu from Makassarese defenders, while the others attempt to breach Somba Opu's walls. Three small Dutch ships and a sloop were set along the Garassi (now the Jeneberang) to attack Somba Opu from the south. Assault of Somba Opu began on 14 June 1669 with the igniting of the explosives placed in a secret tunnel. The blast created an opening about 27.5 meters in the wall of Somba Opu. The fort defenders reacted by sending 25 warriors to block the attackers from breaching in, while others began to erect wooden stakes to close the hole. Speelman decided to ask for the assistance of the soldiers from Batavia. While Speelman gathered his forces, Somba Opu was reinforced with more troops. Somba Opu proved a strong fort to be defeated. The attackers suffered 50 dead and 68 wounded, among them were several Dutch and native officers. On 22 June, after a 6 days of continuous rain, Arung Palakka decided to lead his Bugis, Bacan and Ambon soldiers to enter the breach in the wall. The attack by Arung Palakka was fierce, forcing the Somba Opu warriors to abandon the breach as the Bugis and their allies breached in. Despite the rain, the Bugis managed to set up a fire to force the Makassar soldiers to retreat from the eastern and western bastions of the citadel. The Makassar soldiers reestablish their defenses at the southern half of Somba Opu. During the retreat, the Makassar soldiers utilized the largest cannon of Somba Opu, the Anak Mangkasar (\\"Child of Makassar\\"), which was heaved over the side of the northwestern bastion. As the Dutch-Bugis army advanced from the west, a report came mentioning that the Makassar forces had fled and abandoned Somba Opu. Sultan Hasanuddin of the Makassar force had not wanted to leave but the flames, fanned by a strong northwesterly wind, forced him to leave. The only Makassarese within the fort were Karaeng Karunrung who remained in the palace surrounded by his kris- wielding followers. The people inside the mosque had also been driven out, only the Malay wife of Datu Soppeng, and all her children, plus 80 of her retinue remained. As soon as Somba Opu fell, 8,000 Bugis began to seize the booty, among the most sought item were porcelain and copperwork. By the time Speelman and Arung Palakka arrived at the Sultan's residence in Somba Opu, everything had already been stripped bare. The Dutch made certain that Somba Opu would never be used again by throwing all the guns found on the ramparts. There were 33 cannons weighing about and eleven weighing about , 145 small guns, 83 gun chambers, 2 stone-throwers, 60 muskets, 23 arquebuses, 127 barrels of muskets and 8,483 bullets. Bricks of the walls of Somba Opu were reused for Dutch buildings or local population's wells and house foundations. The fort dilapidated further because of its location on the delta of Jeneberang. Build-up of the delta buried remnants of Somba Opu, making it inaccessible from both land and sea. Somba Opu was rediscovered in the 1980s, on the island formed by two major mouths of the present Jeneberang river. The fort was reconstructed in 1990. A 9-meter cannon has been discovered in the fort, as well as other artifacts which were collected within a nearby site museum. The fort is somewhat forgotten. It is strange that very little attention has been paid by either the Dutch or the Indonesians to the strongest fort ever built by Indonesians, as well as the scene of one of the fiercest battles they ever had to fight. The Fort then and now A cannon in Somba Opu. The fort is located in Kampung Sarombe, on the island formed by two major mouths of the present Jeneberang river. Originally it was a rectangular shaped fort about 240 x 500 meters with bastions on each corner. Currently the southern section (150 meter) of the western wall is the most visible, two- thirds of the original western wall. It is a red brick wall of 3.5 meter thick. Part of the reason why this part survived further damage is because a holy tomb located on the southwest bastion. This bastion is now a mound of 6.5 meters high and 13 meters in diameter. It is known as Maccini' Sombala' (Makassarese \\"the sighting of sails\\") or Tompo' Bataya (Makassarese \\"the highest brick-formation\\"). Maccini' Sombala' was originally the name of the royal palace within Somba Opu, which was built on August 26, 1650, to replace an earlier palace; the name lingered into the bastion centuries later. Another wall extend to the east of the bastion for about 500 meter, broken by flooding at many places. The rear eastern wall can also be traced, though it strangely curves. The once very strong 500-meter-long northern wall is the most difficult to trace. This wall might be washed by a small stream that formed in the past during the development of the delta and washed away the northern part of the ruined fort, as well as its ruined northeast bastion. The area around the fort is planned a recreation park area containing several remnants of the Gowa Kingdom as well as museums and South Sulawesi traditional house. The Gowa Discovery Amusement Park was established to the east end of the park. There is a concern that the heritage of the fort will be clumsily destroyed with the new development.

During that time he shot over 100 films. A pioneer in the industry, he was the cinematographer to film the first movie to star Ethel and John Barrymore. Career Martinelli was thought to be one of the first film cameramen in the United States. In 1915 he was employed by International Pictures, and he moved to Metro Pictures Corp., the forerunner of Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer in 1916. In the 1910s some of his notable films include: The White Raven, starring Ethel Barrymore (1917); 1918's Kildare of Storm, starring Broadway actress Emily Stevens; the Emmy Wehlen vehicle, A Favor to a Friend (1919); and Henry Otto's 1919 comedy, Fair and Warmer. In 1921 he was asked for his opinion about the role of a director in films: > A capable director is a most vital necessity to the motion picture cameraman > and the star. There have been many instances where a cameraman has worked > hard and obtained good photography, but due to poor direction, the picture > was a failure. In the remaining years of the silent era, some of the more notable films which Martinelli shot include: Polly With a Past (1920), starring Ina Claire who was reprising her stage role; Alias Ladyfingers (1921), directed by Bayard Veiller; Ella Cinders (1926), based on the popular comic strip and starring Colleen Moore; and 1926's The Greater Glory, starring Conway Tearle and Boris Karloff. After the advent of sound film, Martinelli would be the director of photography on what is considered the first feature length zombie film, White Zombie (1932), starring Bela Lugosi. During the Hollywood's Golden Age, Martinelli would film over 50 pictures, including: Supernatural (1933), starring Carole Lombard and Randolph Scott; Revolt of the Zombies, the 1936 sequel to White Zombie, starring Dorothy Stone and Dean Jagger; the 1937 western, Drums of Destiny, starring Tom Keene; the 1939 crime drama Star Reporter; the 1940 Bela Lugosi horror film, The Devil Bat; the film noir Federal Fugitives (1941); the 1941 drama, Double Cross; the final installment in the Scattergood Baines film series, Cinderella Swings It (1943); the 1944 Charlie Chan film Black Magic; and the 1945 western, In Old New Mexico, based on O. Henry's 1909 character, The Cisco Kid. His final film was 1948's The Story of Life, a notorious sex hygiene exploitation film, done in 1948.

The shock was estimated to have a magnitude of 8.0 and it had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). With catastrophic damage, it was one of the deadliest recorded earthquakes of all time.  Geology  Because of the time period in which it struck, very little is known about the nature of the earthquake. However, its epicentre was almost certainly located somewhere in what is now Shanxi (Â±±Ë•ø) province, near the present-day towns of Hongdong (Ê¥™Ê¥û) and Zhaocheng (ËµµÂüé). The earthquake likely occurred on the Taigu fault zone in Shanxi, and several scarps and uplifts of local faults were seen as evidence of this; the Taigu fault zone has not experienced any measurable activity since the 1303 earthquake. The magnitude was calculated by modern seismologists to be 8.0 on the moment magnitude scale, though it is impossible to say for sure due to lack of accurate geological data.  Damage and casualties  Devastation was widespread throughout the area struck by the earthquake. In the nearby towns of Zhaocheng and Hongdong, every major temple and school building collapsed and over half the towns' populations perished. Every building in Huo county, Shanxi was destroyed. In Taiyuan and Pingyang, nearly 100,000 houses collapsed and over 200,000 people died from collapsing buildings and loess caves in a similar manner to the situation that would be experienced 253 years later in the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake (ÈôïË•ø). Cracks in the ground turned into miniature rivers, and many canals in Shanxi Province were destroyed, along with city walls. Some reports stated that the earthquake even levelled mountains and hills, altering the topographic makeup of the region. Landslides and soil subsidence and liquefaction triggered by the shaking were a likely root cause of these large- scale environmental changes. Rebuilding was generally slow, owing to the destroyed infrastructure of Shanxi and was interrupted by several other earthquakes in the following years. The 1303 Hongdong earthquake, though currently the last to have occurred on its fault system, marked the start of a centuries-long episode of heightened earthquake activity throughout China, the first of several to occur up to the end of the twentieth century. It was also the first of many examples of earthquakes that demonstrated the tendency of earthquakes in China to strike near loess plateaus.

She was an astronomy professor at Mount Holyoke College for 37 years. Biography Anne Sewell Young was born in Bloomington, Wisconsin on January 2, 1871 to Reverend Albert Adams Young and Mary Sewell. She earned a B.L. from Minnesota's Carleton College in 1892. She then went to Walla Walla, Washington and taught mathematics at Whitman College for three years before returning to Carleton, earning her M.S. in 1897. She earned her Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1906. Her dissertation assessed measurements of early photographs and determined that the constellation Perseus had twice as many stars as previously thought. Young started her career at Mount Holyoke College in 1898. She was appointed director of the John Payson Williston Observatory, where she supervised an observational program tracking sunspots. She organized events at the observatory for Mount Holyoke students and in 1925 arranged for the student body to take the train to central Connecticut to observe the total solar eclipse. In 1929, Young identified the comet 31P/Schwassmann‚ÄìWachmann with an object that had been misidentified as the minor planet \\"Adelaide\\" (A904 EB) in 1904. Young had a pronounced interest in variable stars and corresponded on the subject with Edward Charles Pickering, director of the Harvard College Observatory. She was one of the eight founding members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) and contributed over 6,500 variable star observations to the organization. She was elected the organization's President in 1923. Young retired in 1936 and was succeeded by her former student, Alice Hall Farnsworth, as director of the Williston Observatory. Young moved to Claremont, California with her sister; she died there on August 15, 1961.

The department oversees solid waste (e.g., garbage) and recyclables collection, street cleaning, parking enforcement, and governmental vehicle procurement, maintenance and fueling. Public works in the 19th century On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital for the United States on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Congress subsequently passed the Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the District of Columbia and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. The city's incorporation allowed for a local municipal government consisting of a mayor appointed by the President and an elected six-member council. In 1820, the Congress granted the City of Washington a new charter, which allowed for a mayor elected by voters. Public works during this period largely consisted of creating, grading, and paving roads and sidewalks, creating a stormwater drainage system, and street lighting. But the District had little taxable property with which to generate revenues, and Congress spent little money on infrastructure improvements in the District of Columbia unless they were directly related to federal buildings and property, or to Pennsylvania Avenue. In 1871, Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act, which merged the various town, city, and county governments that controlled the District of Columbia into a single 11-member legislature led by a territorial governor. This legislation also authorized a Board of Public Works, whose duties were to identify critical needs regarding streets, alleys, sewers, roads, and bridges; let contracts; and oversee work. It work was funded by assessments on properties adjacent these improvements, which were approved by the city legislature. The legislature also had sole authority to allow the Board of Public Works to seek loans to begin its various projects. When expenditures on city infrastructure by the Board of Public Works came close to bankrupting the city in 1874, an outraged Congress passed legislation on June 30, 1874, abolishing the territorial government and replacing it with a \\"temporary\\" three-member commission. Two of the commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States with the approval of the Senate, while a third member was selected by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The \\"Corps Commissioner\\" had oversight over the city's public works. Public works under home rule Home Rule Act In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson reorganized the District government. The three-commissioner system was replaced by a government headed by a nine-member city council, a single mayor- commissioner, and an assistant to the mayor-commissioner, all appointed by the president. In March 1971, President Richard Nixon supported legislation formally implementing home rule in the District of Columbia.; On December 24, 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, providing for an elected mayor and the 13-member Council of the District of Columbia.; Department of Public Works Initially, public works under home rule were provided by four city agencies: The Department of Environment, the Department of General Services, the Department of Transportation, and the Office of Surveys. In April 1980, Mayor Marion Barry proposed merging these four agencies into a single Department of Public Works. But Barry's plan was not acted on. Barry scaled back his plan, and in December 1983 he issued Reorganization Plan No. 4. This plan merged the Department of Environmental Services and the Department of Transportation into a new Department of Public Works. The new agency had six divisions: public spaces maintenance; fleet maintenance; design and engineering and construction management of public buildings, streets, and others projects; transportation projects and systems; and construction and maintenance of sewer and water systems. The plan was effective March 1, 1984. The Department of Public Works has had its authority expanded twice. In 1987, Mayor Barry granted the agency the authority \\"to issue grants for research related to the construction and monitoring of public facilities designed to improve water quality.\\" Barry's successor, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly transferred the city's weatherization assistance program from the Department of Housing and Community Development to the Department of Public Works. The department has also had its authority contract twice. The first time occurred in 1988, when the Council of the District of Columbia passed the \\"Division of Park Services Act of 1988\\". This act transferred the city-run parks from the Department of Public Works to the Department of Recreation, and renamed that agency the Department of Recreation and Parks.\\"Legislative History of Laws.\\" Division I. Government of District. Title 10. Parks, Public Buildings, Grounds, and Space. Subtitle I. Parks and Playgrounds. Chapter 1. General Provisions. Section¬ß 10-166. Division of Park Services. (Mar. 16, 1989, D.C. Law 7-209, ¬ß 2, 36 DCR 476.) The second contraction came in 2002, when oversight of transportation projects was removed from the Department of Public Works. The Division of Transportation was a subunit of the Department of Public Works since its creation in 1984. The division began suffering from significant deficiencies in the 1990s, including an over-reliance on outside contractors, a lack of expertise with which to oversee contractors and ensure performance and quality work, severe understaffing, and excessive lead times for the letting and implementing of design and construction contracts. These issues led to significant backlogs in maintenance and construction, and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds were unexpended. In response to the impending management crisis in the transportation division, in May 2002 the Council of the District of Columbia passed the District Department of Transportation Establishment Act of 2002 (D.C. Law 14-137), which separated the Division of Transportation from the Department of Public Works and created a standalone District of Columbia Department of Transportation. A 2004 assessment indicated that the reorganization led to significant improvements in the District of Columbia's oversight of its transportation infrastructure.

Working in the early 1900s, Erdmann was a pioneer of cellular biology and one of few women in her field. Erdmann's work centered around the reproduction of protozoa, with a particular interest in tissue culture and in vitro cellular reproduction. Her work as a protozoologist earned her a position at Yale University as a lecturer at the graduate school, though her time in America was cut short by anti-German sentiment surrounding World War I. After a forcible incarceration and then deportation in 1919, Erdmann took a research position at the Institute for Cancer Research at the Charit√© Hospital of the Friedrich‚ÄêWilhelms University of Berlin. There she instituted the first department for experimental cytology in Germany. She worked at the University for almost 10 years before receiving an official professorship in 1929. Her work was interrupted yet again with the rise of Hitlerism in 1933, when she was stripped of her professorship. She died in Berlin in 1935.  Life and Education  Anna Maria Rhoda Erdmann was born in Hersfeld, Hessen, on December 5, 1870. The daughter of Anna Maria and Dr. Heinrick E. Erdmann, a high school teacher, Erdmann grew up in a family of scientists and physicians. Erdmann attended St. John's school for girls in Hamburg, where she trained to be a teacher of high- and middle-school girls. After passing the examination in 1892, she moved first to England and then Romania to work as a teacher, ultimately ending with a position at a Volksschule in Hamburg in 1899. In 1900, she earned first-class honors in the examination for teaching. In 1903, Erdmann left her teaching position to continue her studies. She took courses in zoology and botany in Berlin, Zurich, Marburg and Munich. She worked with living animal materials at the Naples Zoological Station, and passed the university qualifying examination in 1907 which she received from the Realgymnasium in Kassel (Hessen). She received a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Munich in 1908, working in the laboratory of Dr. Richard von Hertwig. Her dissertation, Experimentelle Untersuchung der Massenverh√§ltnisse von Plasma, Kern und Chromosomen in dem sich entwickelnden Seeigelei, (Experimental investigation of the mass ratios of plasma, nucleus and chromosomes in the developing sea urchin egg) established her career as a protozoologist. She was one of the first women doctoral students in Germany, as women had only been allowed to pursue doctoral research in 1900. After receiving her Ph.D., Erdmann went on to work as a research assistant at the Institute for Infectious Diseases at the Robert Koch Institute and Charit√© Hospital of Berlin, where she worked from 1908 to 1913. Working with August von Wassermann, Erdmann attempted to develop vaccines against Cyanophilia viruses (now recognized at H7 High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza ) in chickens. In 1913, she received a one-year fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation to conduct cytological research at the Osborn Zoological Laboratory at Yale University. At Yale, she worked with Ross Granville Harrison, the noted developmental biologist on methods to propagate cells in vitro. After her fellowship ended, she received an offer from Harrison to return to Yale as a lecturer‚Äîremarkable, given Yale's charter had to be changed to admit a woman as faculty. From 1915 to 1918, she was a member of the Yale faculty and the first woman member of the Yale Graduate Faculty. In 1915 she was named a research associate at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, where she spent summers studying tissue culture techniques. Erdmann was able to successfully culture chicken bone marrow cells as part of her attempts to attenuate the cyanolophia virus. These studies were important for future work in hematology and virology. In addition, her work on the survival of Paramecium cultures led to important insights on cellular senescence and methods of genetic transmission Her work at Yale and Princeton was interrupted by World War I. Wartime hysteria cast suspicion on German citizens; as a German citizen working in biology, people began to suspect Erdmann of culturing malicious bacteria. In 1918 Erdmann was accused of poisoning the New Haven drinking water supply and introducing chicken cholera to the U.S. She lost her job at Yale in February 1918, and was jailed from May until September, when she was bailed out by Harrison and a number of female friends. She was then deported to Germany the following spring. Erdmann struggled to find work in Germany, and it was a full year before she got a position at the Institute for Cancer Research at the Charit√© Hospital of the Friedrich‚ÄêWilhelms University of Berlin. There she established a department of experimental cell research, the first of its kind in Germany. She received faculty status in the Zoology department at the university in 1920. She was appointed to the medical faculty in 1923, and promoted to Associate Professor with full civil service status in 1929. In April 1930, her department was officially separated and named the Institute of Experimental Cytology (Institut f√ºr Experimentell Zellforschung), where she served as director. At the institute, she introduced tissue culture methods that she had learned in the U.S. Among her many contributions was the demonstration that cancer could be propagated by cell-free filtrates containing viruses She was the first German woman to lead a university institute. Erdmann also founded the periodical Archiv f√ºr experimentelle Zellforschung in 1925 and served as its editor until her death. She conceived the idea of an International Society for Experimental Cytology and served as permanent its general secretary. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, she was banned from laboratory work having been denounced by the eugenicist Henry Zeiss and the orthopedic surgeon Hermann Gocht as being Jewish. When this turned out to be untrue, she was accused of helping her Jewish students to secure positions and to emigrate Her institute was closed and she was forced to retire. She was jailed in the spring of 1933 for two weeks by the Gestapo, but was released due to international pressure. However, in 1934 the German Government opened another institute for experimental cytology under her direction. She was active until her death, having recently completed a manuscript Erdmann died in Berlin on August 24, 1935 at the age of 64 of a heart attack. In 1992, the German section of the European Tissue Culture Association created a research fund in Dr. Erdmann's name.

From 1853 to 1914 it was the official residence for the wardens of the Minnesota Territorial Prison, which became the Minnesota State Prison upon statehood in 1858. The Washington County Historical Society has operated the house since 1941, making it the second-oldest house museum in Minnesota. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as the Minnesota Territorial/State Prison Warden's House for having state-level significance in the themes of architecture and social history. It was nominated for being the only surviving structure of the prison's Minnesota Territory period and the chief remnant of its statehood years. Description The Warden's House seen adjacent to the prison in 1885 The Warden's House is a two-story building constructed of local limestone. The house is oriented broadside to the east, with a shallow pitched roof and low gables on the north and south end. Architecturally it conveys an early Greek Revival style but with Federal influences. Wood-frame additions were added to the rear in 1870. The house originally had a full-width balcony along the front, which was replaced in 1910 with a two-story porch topped with a gable. Since the building's 1974 National Register nomination, this porch has been replaced with a smaller balcony-topped porch hugging the main entrance. There was originally a two-story frame carriage house behind the main house, but it was demolished around the time the prison ceased operation in 1914. History The Warden's House was part of the original construction for the Minnesota Territorial Prison. It stood outside the walls on a bluff overlooking the prison complex, which was located immediately to the north within a ravine. The prison was in operation for 61 years, from 1853 to 1914. In that time 13 successive wardens resided in the house, serving terms as short as five months to as long as 20 years. The first two wardens were appointed by the territorial legislature, then, for the first 40 years of statehood, by the Governor of Minnesota with State Senate confirmation. In 1889, to quell political favoritism in the choices, legislation assigned the selection of wardens to a five-person board of managers. The original prison complex closed in 1914 upon the completion of a new Minnesota State Prison just south of Stillwater in Bayport. The Warden's House then served as quarters for lesser officials like deputy wardens and superintendents. Most of the prison complex was demolished in 1936. The Warden's House was preserved and transferred to the Washington County Historical Society in 1941. Museum The Warden's House Museum consists of 14 rooms, which have been restored to late-19th and early-20th-century style. Some depict how the house would have looked during its occupancy by various wardens, while others contain exhibits on Washington County history. Some rooms in the museum house artifacts from the lumbering industry, early Stillwater pioneers, and items belonging to the Younger Brothers of the Frank and Jesse James Gang. The Warden's House Museum is the only museum in the city of Stillwater.

He finished his studies in 1922 and embarked on a ship. After a trip of practices, he stayed in Venezuela due to his interest in exploration. Later, he returned to Malgrat de Mar and founded a textile factory but had to escape to Venezuela due to economic problems. Cardona made several expeditions, staying a long time with the natives. Together with Joan Maria Mund√≥ i Freixas, he organised an expedition to the southwest of Venezuela starting in San Pedro de las Bocas, along the rivers Caroni and Caruao until they arrived to the Auy√°n-tepui, discovering the waterfall now known as Angel Falls (in honour of Jimmie Angel, but in the native tongue were designated as Churun Mer√∫).  On January 25, 1932, Cardona married Carlot Votti (\\"Loti\\"), of Dresden, Germany. In 1937, Cardona accompanied Jimmie Angel flying over the Chur√∫n Mer√∫.

In 1946, he was designated a Botanic Explorer by the \\"Direcci√≥n de fronteras del Ministerio de Relaciones Interiores de Venezuela\\" (Direction of Borders of the Ministry of Inner Relations of Venezuela). Many plant species and even some animals have been named after him, for they were discovered by him.

Services  Organizations can use the Maistro platform for spot purchasing or as a company-wide sourcing and delivery system. Organizations buying services through Maistro, submit project briefs to the Marketplace. All service providers in the Marketplace are vetted by Maistro before being given access to project briefs, and approved service providers respond with a proposal that outlines how they can best meet the project requirements. The pitch process is blind: service providers do not know who the client is and must pitch solely on information available in the brief. Once the pitch deadline has passed, the blur team reviews the pitches and presents the top three providers to the client. The client then selects the winning candidate and the project begins. Maistro manages the client/provider relationship for the duration of the project; all communications and invoicing is completed through Maistro's cloud-based workspace.  History  The company was founded as Blur Group PLC in 2007 and was based in Exeter Science Park, Exeter, in the UK. Its early service offerings included a b2b exchange, b-uncut.net, focused initially on the media and creative industries. Under the leadership of CEO Philip Letts (formerly CEO of Beenz.com), an investment round in Q4 2011 attracted investment from Archie Norman, among others. In 2012, the company claimed its 1,200th project, and went public on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in October 2012. In 2013, Blur raised $11.5m in a secondary round of financing and opened an office in Dallas, Texas, followed by raising a further $22m in May 2014. Also in 2014, it claimed the third iteration of its platform was being adopted faster than anticipated. In 2015, it claimed it had 65,000 service providers. Financial reporting concerns In 2014, Blur Group's stock price fell due to concerns regarding how revenue was reported. This came to light after a profit warning was released, indicating that multiple projects valued at over $100,000 were delayed until the next quarter, resulting in an 80% plunge in stock prices over previous year. Blur issued four profit warnings between January 2014 and May 2015, and had to replace three CFOs in two years. An investigation led by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) was initiated to determine if Blur Group was the principal or agent with regards to the outsourcing services provided. The investigation concluded in September 2015, with the FRC welcoming the actions taken by the Blur Group directors, which included making a prior year restatement to reduce reported revenues and increase loss before taxes, as well as clarify the organisation's revenue recognition accounting policy. Further financial reporting problems led to the company's shares being suspended in June 2017, and reports that Blur could go into administration. Leadership changes In July 2017, the company replaced its entire board. After Letts left the company on 1 August 2017 (having presided over a share price plunge from a 2014 high of 665p to 3p), Laurence Cook, appointed as chief commercial officer in November 2016, became Blur Group CEO, and new chairman David Rowe slashed costs and raised ¬£1.5 million to try to steady the company. The company moved its UK office to Pynes Hill in Exeter in late 2017. Name change, delisting In January 2018, Blur Group PLC changed its name to Maistro PLC. On 28 June 2019, at the request of the company, Maistro PLC Ordinary Shares were cancelled from trading on AIM and the company became a private limited company.

The company specializes in the development of antibodies for the treatment infectious diseases. The antibodies are developed from protein complexes called heteropolymers which can bind to specific pathogens on one side and red blood cells on the other side. The pathogens will be dragged to the liver where they will be destroyed. The antibodies have a potential to be used for the treatments of many blood-borne diseases. Currently, the company focuses on the late-stage clinical trials of Anthim (Obiltoxaximab) to be used for treatment and prevention of inhaled anthrax. History Ronald P. Taylor, a professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the University of Virginia developed protein complexes called heteropolymers that mimic the natural process of white and red blood cells in clearing out the disease off the bloodstream. The heteropolymers have specific binding that can bind to specific pathogens on one side and red blood cells on the other side. The red blood cells with the attached pathogens are delivered to the liver to be destroyed. In animal testing, the method can clear out pathogens within 2 hours. Taylor's research were partially funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Additional funding was arranged by Seed-One Ventures, a venture capital company, through the formation of Elusys Therapeutics to raise several million dollars. Jeff Wolf, the CEO of Seed-One, selected Stephen Sudovar as the CEO of Elusys. Sudovar was the former President of Roche Laboratories a division of Hoffmann-La Roche. Wolf also arranged to have Elusys' board of directors made up of people with prior experience from top global pharmaceutical companies and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a startup, the company tested its first heteropolymers by using two chemically linked monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of lupus. Elusys is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity. The alliance is a group of companies and scholars that work to promote the development of vaccines and other measures that can be used in the case of a pandemic or bioterrorism attack.  Treatment Anthim is monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of exposure to Bacillus anthracis spores (etiologic agent of anthrax). Elusys initially collaborated with University of Texas at Austin and United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in the development of Anthim. With the bioterrorism risk of anthrax, the United States Department of Health and Human Services awarded a five-year contract in 2010 valued at $143 million to develop IV-based drug to treat patients who are already infected by anthrax. In 2011, the company was awarded with an additional five-year contract valued at $68.9 million to develop intramuscular injection for anthrax prevention measure. In 2012, the company was awarded additional $50.2 million to test the efficacy of the treatment. The Biologics License Application for both intravenous and intramuscular administrations was accepted by the FDA in June 2015 with efficacy data of animal models and safety data from human volunteers. In March 2016, Anthim was approved to treat inhalational anthrax in conjunction with appropriate antibacterial drugs, also for prevention when alternative therapies are not available or appropriate. In November 2015, the company received a five-year contract of $44.9 million for the production and future delivery of Anthim to the Strategic National Stockpile.

After his father's death, in 1830, he took charge of the farm for a year or two, and was then at length able to begin his preparation for Yale, where he graduated in 1837. After graduation he was principal of Bacon Academy, in Colchester, Conn., until the summer of 1838, and again from March, 1840, until the summer of 1843; in the interval he was instructor in the Teachers' Academy, Andover, Mass. He began theological studies while in Andover, and was licensed to preach shortly after his final withdrawal from Bacon Academy. He had married, January 10, 1838, Julia S., daughter of Elisha Avery, of Colchester, and he retained his residence there‚Äîengaged in farming, private teaching, and preaching‚Äîuntil January, 1845, when he removed to Norwich, Conn, where he served as teacher in the academy for two terms. While living there he accepted a call to the Congregational Church in North Stonington, Connecticut, over which he was ordained, April 15, 1846. After a pleasant pastorate of six years, he was induced, chiefly for the sake of educational advantages to his children, to accept a thrice-repeated call to the Congregational Church in West Hartford, Conn, where he was installed, July 1, 1852 His service there was terminated by his resignation, April 27, 1875, but his home continued among his people. While still a pastor in July, 1867, he was elected a Fellow of Yale College, and this office he retained until his death. He was twice a Representative (in 1872 and 1875) from West Hartford to the Connecticut Legislature, and for many years one of the school-visitors for the town.

It stood at 590 Commonwealth Avenue inside a parking garage that was converted into a club by promoter George Papadopoulo in 1967. The Psychedelic Supermarket was active for two years, before its closing. The venue was established in August 1967 by promoter George Papadopoulo. Papadopoulo, who was already an owner of a popular Boston-based folk club called the Unicorn, hastily put together the Psychedelic Supermarket in an abandoned parking garage to cash in on the scheduled performances dropped by the Crosstown Bus after it was shut down by police. On September 8, 1967, the Supermarket opened to an eight-day stay by Cream, just as the psychedelic rock group was preparing to record their second album Disraeli Gears. Cream utilized this time to practice their new material, including \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" and \\"Strange Brew\\", before showcasing themselves to a national audience. However, for what it offered with major musical acts, the Psychedelic Supermarket's greatest shortcoming was its need of renovation and refurbishing. The venue was described as a \\"very industrial place\\" that had walls littered with album covers, no windows, and could hold between 200 and 300 patrons, but in its beginning stages the Supermarket had no seats installed. Perhaps the only positive of being situated in a parking lot was the elevated ceiling which allowed for more lucrative light shows. Throughout its existence, the venue featured a mixture of nationally recognized acts such as the Grateful Dead, Moby Grape, and Country Joe and the Fish, and local Boston bands like Eden's Children, the Freeborne, and Listening. In 1969, Papadopoulo closed the original site of the Unicorn Coffee House (733-825 Boylston Street, Back Bay, Boston) and moved its operations into the Psychedelic Supermarket. The venue did not stay open for too long thereafter as Boston's psychedelic rock scene, also known as the Bosstown Sound, was on a decline. The building was converted into a movie theater known as the Nickelodeon, before being demolished for a science lab for Boston University.

Italian film historian Roberto Curti suggested that the film may have been a troubled production, noting the lack of an editor in the credits and that film had a sudden pessimistic ending. Release The film was not released for several years after its initial film production, and released in Italy in July 1968 where it was distributed by Bianco Nero Film. The film was released directly to television as Run, Psycho, Run through American International Television (AIP-TV). The dubbing cast included Carolyn De Fonseca and John Karlsen and Gary Merrill dubbing his own voice. Run, Psycho, Run was first shown in the United States on November 2, 1969, on Sacramento's KCRA-Channel 3 as part of his Seven Arts Theater show. As of 2015, the film has never been released on home video.

He began composing music and performing as a concert pianist before the age of 11. He has performed with symphony orchestras throughout the world, and has composed numerous art songs and five operas. He worked as a vocal coach at the Metropolitan Opera from 1991 until retiring from his full time position in July 2019. Early life and education Born to Japanese parents in Dobbs Ferry, New York, Noda grew up in Scarborough and was educated at the Hackley School (graduated 1980). He began studying the piano at age five and was admitted into the Juilliard School on a full scholarship at the age of seven. He has studied piano privately with Daniel Barenboim, Adele Marcus, and Sylvia Rabinof. He studied singing with Beverley Peck Johnson, and for many years was her studio accompanist at Juilliard. In 1986 he was awarded an Avery Fisher Career Grant worth $10,000 (). Opera compositions Noda composed his first opera, The Canary and the Baseball, at the age of 10, a work which premiered at the Brevard Music Festival on August 18, 1973, and was later staged by the educational wing of the New York City Opera. At the age of 13 he was awarded a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts to compose a three-act opera, The Rivalry (1976), which was his third work in that genre. He has since composed two more operas: The Highwayman (1979) and The Magic Turtle (1980). By the time he was 16 years old he had composed 65 art songs. Performance career Noda began performing at a young age, and by the age of 14 he had already appeared as a soloist in concerts with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony, and the New York Philharmonic. Other orchestras he has performed with include the Berlin Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris, the Philharmonia Orchestra, and the Vienna Philharmonic among others. In 1980 Noda performed at Royal Albert Hall for The BBC Proms. In 1982, at the age of 20, he was invited by President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan to perform alongside violinist Itzhak Perlman in the East Room of the White House. The performance was recorded for the PBS television program In Performance at the White House. In 1983 he closed out the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center playing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 under the baton of Leonard Slatkin. In 1989 he performed in concert with the Emerson String Quartet for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. In 1991 Noda ceased his performance career after becoming disillusioned with the classical musical world and the role he was playing in it. In an interview with The New York Times several years later, Noda stated the following: > Young people like romance stories and war stories and good-and-evil stories > and old movies because their emotional life mostly is and should be fantasy. > They put that fantasized emotion into their playing, and it is very > convincing. I had an amazing capacity for imagining these feelings, and > that's part of what talent is. But it dries up, in everyone. That's why so > many prodigies have midlife crises in their late teens or early 20s. If our > imagination is not replenished with experience, the ability to reproduce > these feelings in one's playing gradually diminishes. After halting his performance career, Noda joined the staff of the Metropolitan Opera as a vocal coach and administrator in 1991 and has since only performed rarely as a soloist. He continues to perform with regularity as an accompanist to singers in recitals in New York City. Performers he has accompanied include, among others: * Roberto Alagna * June Anderson * Kathleen Battle * Hildegard Behrens * Stephen Costello * Danielle de Niese * Alexandra Deshorties * Maria Ewing * Lauren Flanigan * Ren√©e Fleming * Angela Gheorghiu * Anthony Dean Griffey * Andrea Gruber * Marilyn Horne * Ying Huang * Mariusz Kwiecie≈Ñ * Aprile Millo * Kurt Moll * Brian Mulligan * Jessye Norman * Lisette Oropesa * Sean Panikkar * Ailyn P√©rez * Matthew Polenzani * Russell Thomas * Dawn Upshaw * Benita Valente * Deborah Voigt Educator and work at the Metropolitan Opera Since 1999 Noda has taught on the faculty at the Marlboro Music School and Festival. He also spent four summers teaching at the Renata Scotto Opera Academy and gives masterclasses in opera at the Yale School of Music and the Juilliard School. He currently serves on the staff of the Metropolitan Opera as musical assistant to conductor James Levine and as an instructor to singers in the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program. He has also served as a judge for the final round of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. He began working at the Met as a vocal coach in 1991.

They are not to be confused with either the American band of the same name who became popular in the late 1970s, nor the British band of the same name in the 1960s. They were noted for their melodic and instrumental finesse and secured a recording contract with Capitol Records. The band nevertheless failed to break through to a national audience. In the intervening years their work has come to the attention of 1960s music collectors and enthusiasts, especially with the release of the Time Waits for No One anthology. History The Knack were formed in 1965 at by students at Hollywood High School led by Michael Chain. The original name for the band was the InMates. Their original line-up consisted Mike Chain on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Dink Kaplan on lead guitar, and Larry Gould on bass and backing vocals, and Ken Meyers on drums. R2 519759 - liner notes After traveling on a Shindig road show, the band changed their name to the Knack. Dink Kaplan's older brother played in the Mothers of Invention. Not long after forming, Meyers left the group and was replaced by Pug Baker on drums. The band initially played on the high school circuit, but would advance to the more popular clubs on the Sunset Strip: the Hullabaloo, the Whiskey-A- Go-Go, the Galaxy, the Trip, the Crescendo, Gazzarri‚Äôs, It‚Äôs Boss, the Cheetah, the Cherokee, the Sea Witch, and others. They were also the first rock group to appear at the Ice House folk room and the Troubadour. The Knack would eventually performed shows at larger venues such as the Hollywood Bowl, Palladium, Melody Land, and Carousel. The group's manager, known as Abe and Rick Marcelli, arranged for Nick Venet, who had been the Beach Boys producer, to come to a club to see them perform on stage. Venet later invited A&R; personnel at Capitol Records, which paved the way for the band to be signed by the famous label. Venet would produce all of the Knack's recordings at Capitol and Mike Chain would write most of them. The Knack recorded all of their songs at Studio A at the Capital Records' famous headquarters on Hollywood and Vine and played all their own instruments, which was unusual in Los Angeles studios at the time, particularly in light of their young age, with most of the band members still in high school. The band was regarded for their instrumental and melodic finesse. The band's debut single for Capitol was \\"Time Waits For No One\\" b/w \\"I'm Aware, \\" which is set in a minor key. In 1967 Capitol released their second single, \\"Softly Softly\\", a slower song, which included Frank Zappa on piano. backed with \\"The Spell\\", a more upbeat number. Capitol scheduled the group on a cross-country tour as part of their promotional strategy. This resulted in the formation of numerous fan clubs, but Capitol‚Äôs insistence on using the hyperbolic motto, \\"better than the Beatles,\\" led to an ill-fated marketing campaign. Chain was opposed to the use of the motto, but was overruled by the rest of the band. Later in 1967 the band released their third single, \\"Pretty Daisy\\" b/w \\"Banana Man.\\" \\"Pretty Daisy\\" has a trumpet part played by a session man. Eventually Dink Kaplan would leave, replaced by Bobby Cochran on lead guitar. In 1968 Capitol released their last single \\"Freedom Now\\" b/w \\"Lady In The Window.\\" \\\\- 45cat has photo of promotional copy, so serial number has a \\"P,\\" unlike on the commercial release The band broke up in 1969. Mike Chain, along with the Merry-Go-Round‚Äôs Gary Kato, would go on to form Pinkiny Canandy and record for Uni Records. He would later do tours in Iraq and Afghanistan for American soldiers. In the intervening years the Knack have come to the attention of 1960s music collectors and enthusiasts. Their work has been featured on several compilations such as the Where the Action Is! Los Angeles Nuggets: 1965‚Äì1968 four-disc CD box set put out by Rhino Records.

Willie Nelson bust cake Considered by Sideserf as her breakout opportunity, her submission of a bust made in the likeness of country music singer Willie Nelson won best in show at a cake competition hosted in Austin, Texas. When her brother posted an image of the cake to Reddit, it reached number-one on February 23, 2013, garnering over 1.2 million views. Although it was Sideserf's first attempt at a sculpted bust, the positive reaction prompted her to launch her own company, Sideserf Cake Studio. Severed Heads wedding cake In October 2013, just eight months after receiving global attention from the Willie Nelson cake, Sideserf took on a much darker subject as a follow-up: the decapitated heads of her and her groom-to-be. ‚ÄúI was heavily influenced by the Halloween season, my husband's love for horror movies, and the venue which was the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema,‚Äù she told FoxNews.com in an email. ‚ÄúWhile we do a vast array of different cake designs for our customers, hyperrealism has been one of my favorite subjects so the thought of doing our severed heads was a no-brainer (no pun intended).‚Äù The cake was featured on Episode 40 of ABC's The Chew.

Two Guinean soldiers and a Burkinabe contractor were killed, with 20 more injured. Ansar Dine claimed responsibility for the attack. Background Following the Libyan Civil War, Tuaregs fighting in the Libyan Arab Republic's Libyan army fled to northern Mali with weapons. The ensuing insurgency quickly led to the self-declared independence and consequent armed Islamist insurgency by MOJWA and Ansar Dine against the secular MNLA. This led to Operation Serval by France. The UN base in Kidal was targeted in March as well, resulting in the deaths of two children and a Chadian peacekeeper. In the days preceding the November 2015 attack, the Radisson Blu was attacked in Mali's capital, Bamako. The attack was claimed by three Islamist militant groups ‚Äî al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, its splinter group, the secular named al Mourabitoun and Massina Liberation Front. MINUSMA has had over 50 deaths, making it the most fatal UN mission since the 1993-95 UNOSOM II in Somalia. Attack According to MINUSMA spokesman Olivier Salgado, the attack happened in Kidal at about 04:00 when \\"four or five rockets landed inside the base.\\" After the rockets landed, bursts of gunfire occurred. Mortar fire also emanated from inside the camp. At least 2 Guinean troops and a civilian contractor were killed, 14 others were wounded. The camp had received a warning two days before the attack from an unnamed Islamist group. A local government official, Ahmoudene Ag Ikmasse, blamed radical Islamists. Responsibility Ansar Dine claimed responsibility for the attack. Reactions MINUSMA chief Mongi Hamdi issued a statement that read the attacks \\"would not dent the determination of the UN to support the Malian people and the peace process, including assisting in the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali.\\" The UN issued a statement that read: \\"The members of the Security Council called on the Government of Mali to swiftly investigate this attack and bring the perpetrators to justice, and stressed that those responsible for the attack should be held accountable\\" and that it may constitute war crimes.

It belongs to the Diocese of V√§xj√∂. Dating from the Middle Ages, it was heavily reconstructed during the 19th century. History and architecture The first church on this spot was a stave church, built in the 11th century. Traces of the stave church can still be discerned in the church tower. The wooden church was replaced by a stone church during the 1160s, and during the same century it was rebuilt into a fortified church. The church eventually had two towers as well as a fighting platform. Of this medieval church only the tower remains today, however. In 1825 the congregation decided to replace the old church with a new one, and in 1828 the church was demolished. A new, Neoclassical church was added to the still standing western tower. The tower itself was slightly altered and a roof lantern was added to it. The new church was inaugurated in 1837, while its southern portal was added as late as 1863 and carries the monogram of King Charles XV. Apart from the western tower, the church is Neoclassical in style both inside and outside. The architect was C. Blom-Carlsson. Under the floor of the church, the foundations of the medieval church still exist. The tower is an unusually well-preserved defensive medieval church tower. It still contains vaulted rooms, storage facilities and a privy, which is possibly the oldest privy in Sweden. The tower has probably been used as a shelter both during peace and war, and remains of scraps of food, clothes and tokens for board games have been found there. Among the church fittings, the dominating altarpiece was made in 1776 by the local artist Anders Georg Wadsten and so is incorporated into the 19th century church from the old church. The church also still contains several medieval items. The baptismal font dates from the 13th century, the altar is from the 12th and made of sandstone from Gotland. There is also a late medieval crucifix and two medieval sculptures, one from the late 14th century and one from c. 1500. The pulpit dates from 1762.

After World War II the trains of the Berlin U-Bahn were worn out, making a new series of trains necessary. From 1957 on the new D type trains were delivered (also called Stahldora/Steel Dora). They were made of steel, making them very heavy. In 1965, the DL type was developed, which was constructed from lighter metals (also called Dora). This way, weight was reduced by 26%. Like in earlier types the seats were located along the sides of the train. Class D EIII The D type cars have been introduced in various phases: *D 55: The test vehicle (2000/2001), which is on the Line C II (Mehringdamm - Tempelhof) *D 57: 26 trains (2002/2003 - 2052/2053), which is on the Line C I, during the opening of the line to Tegel (now known as U6). *D 60: 30 trains (2054/2055 - 2112/2113), which is on the Line G (now known as U9, the line was built as an alternative line when the Berlin Wall is built). *D 63: 36 trains (2114/2115 - 2184/2185), which is on the Line C I, during the opening of the line to Britz (now known as U7). *D 65: 22 trains (2186/2187 - 2228/2229), which is on the Line C II, during the extension to Alt-Mariendorf. On 1974 with the introduction of F type cars, the D 60 trains were redeployed to Line 6 and D 57 trains were redeployed to Line 8. Because the BVB (the East Berlin public transport authority) needed more trains for their new route to H√∂now, BVB bought 98 cars of this type from the BVG in several phases, which is older and the shelf lifespan is 30 years and needs replacement. BVB renumbered all trains that were sent to East Berlin into the numbering system with the class number \\"110\\": *1988: 2002/2003 to 2018/2019, 2022/2023 to 2052/2053 (when the U5 is extended to Elsterwader Platz), they were renumbered to 110 300 to 110 349. *1989: 2054/2055 to 2112/2113, with the exception of 2072/2073, 2076/2077 and 2100/2101 (when the U5 is extended to H√∂now), they were renumbered to 110 350 to 110 401. The first trains began revenue service on 110 326/327 (ex 2030/2031) and 110 306/307 (ex 2008/2009) on March 1988 via Alexanderplatz connecting tunnels. They were called DI in the east. Of course, they were painted in the East Berlin color scheme of ebony and yellow. 7 trains (110 386-110 397, also known as 2096 to 2099 and 2102 to 2109) all returned to BVG early on November 1990. After the merger of BVB with BVG in January 1992, these trains continued to deploy on the U5, U6, U7 and U8 until the retirement in 1998-99. The last trains of the 'D' type were retired in 1999, and they were sold to Pyongyang Metro, North Korea. U5, March 2017 Class DL The DL type cars have been introduced in various phases: *DL65: 3 trains (2230/2231 - 2234/2235), which is on the Line H, during the extension to Mockernbr√ºcke. *DL68: 68 trains (2236/2237 - 2370/2371), which is on the Line 6, replacing B type cars. *DL70: 30 trains (2372/2373 - 2430/2431), which is on the Line 7, during the extension to Rudow. The DL trains were all deployed on Line 6 and 7 until 1992, and most of them were also deployed to Line U5 after the merger of BVB with BVG. The last trains of this type were retired at the end of the year 2004. The traditional farewell run of this series was on 27 February 2005. No trains have been preserved in the DL series, and all were scrapped at Eberswalde. The DL68 2260 was retired in 2001 and later sold to a company in Hardenberg, the Netherlands, where it was placed on the company premises. The railcar 2348, also a DL68 serves since his retirement in 2005 the Berlin Police as a training object. Three further units are to this day as auxiliary equipment trains of the workshops Britz (4012/4013, formerly 2206/2207, type D65), Seestrasse (4014/4015, formerly 2214/2215, type D65) and Friedrichsfelde (4016/4017, formerly 2182/2183 , Type D63) in the net on the way. As work vehicles they received in the course of the conversion an orange paint job, among other things, a part of the passenger window was removed. In addition, there are two modernized DL68 units, each parked on the Bw Friedrichsfelde (2246/2247) and on the Bw Britz (4028/4029, formerly 2340/2341) and serve since 2004 only as a storage room. The Friedrichsfelder vehicle is to be re-equipped from the end of 2016 as a third unit for the regular service. Preservation There are only two museum trains, 2000/2001 (Prototype) and 2020/2021. Due to insufficient number of trains as well as financing constraints, the BVG decided in 2016 to modernise these two units for service on the line U55 until the U5 extension opens in 2019. These trains were equipped with electronic destination displays, and to adapt with their modern safety requirements. Buttons will replace their handles on doors. Flashing lights and warning sounds have also been introduced to the trains to let passengers know whenever doors are closing or opening. Cameras will also be installed as part of security for customers and rail staff. The green seats will remain but it will be upholstered. The historic trains began running on 1 March 2017 for 23-day trial on U5 before moving to the U55.

Co-produced by Eros International with RV Films, the film tells the story of two fan club leaders of the actors Kamal Haasan and Rajnikanth in Tirunelveli during 1988. The film had a theatrical release across Tamil Nadu on 24 March 2017.

Director Ramu had earlier assisted director Pandiraj in Pasanga & Vamsam and Kedi Billa Killadi Ranga (2013) and worked as an assistant to director Selvaraghavan in Mayakkam Enna (2011). He had wanted to make a film set in the 1980s after being inspired by Sasikumar's Subramaniapuram (2008) and had successfully narrated the script to Soundarya Rajinikanth, who had been on Eros's board at the time. While writing the script, Ramu travelled to Nagercoil and Madurai and interviewed several cutout artists, while Natraj was given training by cutout artist Sada for his role in the film. Production began in mid 2015, with the film revealed to be about opposing fan groups of actors Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan from the 1980s. Parvathy Nair was picked for a lead role, after the director was impressed with her performances in Yennai Arindhaal (2015) and Uttama Villain (2015). Sanchita Shetty was also cast in the film to portray a village belle and a Rajinikanth fan, who would be the love interest of Natraj. Soundtrack Natarajan Sankaran composed both songs and background score for this film, with Yugabharathi penning all the lyrics. Release The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Tamil. The film had a theatrical release across Tamil Nadu on 24 March 2017, with the Deccan Chronicle giving the film a positive review. The critic stated \\"Enkitta Mothathey brims of life and enthusiasm and the cutouts bring this to the fore\\" and \\"Ramu Chellappa has done a good job in not the portraying the era in a frantic manner, but instead has used the fervent energy of the fans to its advantage\\". Likewise, The Hindu stated \\"Enkitta Mothathe can hope to reach for the stars\\" and that the film \\"aptly reflects the times and lives of the cut-out artists of the 80s\\". The Times of India wrote \\"a slew of characters, their unexpected plans to check the growth of the mandrams, a tale of friendship and two romantic tracks which run in parallel, keep the film engaging\\" but that \\"Ramu Chellappa doesn‚Äôt generate enough drama, and also fails to provide a satisfying conclusion\\". A review from India Today stated \\"Despite a very very generic story, Ramu Chellappa has wonderfully captured the aura surrounding a Rajini-Kamal release\\" and \\"for the same, Engitta Modhathey is nothing short of a nostalgia trip\\". Despite the favourable reviews, the film was removed from most screens by its second week owing to extended competition at the box office. Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote \\"Slowly, Enkitta Mothathe begins to turn into one of those dramas where friends are manipulated by ruthless politicians and their henchmen. Even here, the director brings in Kamal-Rajini shadings.\\"https://www.filmcompanion.in/enkitta-mothathe-movie-review/ References External links * 2010s Tamil-language films 2017 films Films set in 1988 Films set in a movie theatre Indian action drama films Indian films Indian historical action films Indian historical films Tamil-language films ","title":"Enkitta Mothathe (2017 film)"},{"id":"48671299","text":"The Battle of Ripple Field, fought on 13 April 1643, was an engagement in the First English Civil War. In the battle, a Royalist calvalry force led by Prince Maurice routed Parliamentarian cavalry and infantry forces led by Sir William Waller.  Prelude  After marching north from Tewkesbury, Waller tried to block the cavalry forces of Prince Maurice and the Royalists by containing them on the western bank of the Severn River. Prince Maurice, however, successfully crossed the Severn at Upton-Upon-Severn and quickly proceeded south through Ryall to confront Waller's men who had taken a defensive position in Ripple Field..  Battle  An initial cavalry charge by Waller was easily repelled by the Royalists. The Parliamentarians then retreated into the lanes of the village of Ripple where they were overrun and routed. The Haselrigges Lobsters Regiment lost around 70% of their men defending the retreating Parliament army which was attempting to return to Tewkesbury. At the end, Parliamentary reinforcements checked the Royalists at Mythe Hill just north of Tewkesbury.

History Immingham Dock was opened on 22 July 1912 by the Great Central Railway at a point where the deep water channel came close to the Lincolnshire bank of the Humber. To get their workers from Kingston-upon-Hull, , and surrounding villages to the dock the company built the Barton and Immingham Light Railway, which initially terminated at Immingham Western Jetty station, situated next to the ramp carrying lines onto the jetty itself. Workers coming from Grimsby and surrounds were catered for by the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway, an inter-urban tram system running from Grimsby which had its own terminus named Immingham Dock. This stood on the opposite side of the dock's entrance lock gates. Immingham Western Jetty station had a single platform station built of wood. It had none of the usual facilities. The only structure other than the platform and fence was a wooden ticket collector's hut not dissimilar to those found at modern car parks. Services were provided from New Holland, leaving what is now the Barton Line south of , calling at East Halton and Killingholme stations before reaching Immingham. The July 1922 Bradshaw shows the station still in use. At some point in or after 1922 the station was closed and replaced by the altogether more solid and permanent Immingham Dock station a short distance southeast, within sight of the dock's entrance locks. A photo of a locomotive at Immingham Dock station in Great Central Railway livery suggests that the handover took place in the early 1920s.

It belongs to the Diocese of V√§xj√∂. History and architecture Wedding of Margaretha, Princess of Sweden and John Ambler in 1964 In the church porch of G√§rdsl√∂sa Church stands a Christian runestone, indicating that there could have been a wooden church on the same spot as early as the 11th century. The presently visible church however dates from the 12th century; according to tradition it was inaugurated in 1138. The oldest parts of the church are the westernmost part of the nave. Only slightly later is the foundation of the tower. The church was successively rebuilt and expanded during the Middle Ages. Thus the vaulting of the church dates from circa 1240, and the choir was rebuilt in stages during the late 13th century by a master stonemason from Gotland by the name Ronensis. Its crow-stepped gable is unique for its kind on √ñland. The interior has also been decorated with frescos from several periods. One cycle dates from the 13th century, and others are from 1498, the late 16th century and 1642, respectively. G√§rdsl√∂sa Church is the best preserved medieval church on √ñland. Apart from the church spire and the windows, which were enlarged in 1845, the church still in principle retains its medieval appearance. The church was renovated in 1957‚Äì58. Today the church consists of a nave and transept, a choir of almost equal width as the nave and a church tower in the west. The walls of the exterior are whitewashed (except for a small area). Inside, the church is characterised by the many frescos. The altarpiece was made in 1764‚Äì66 and seeks to imitate the altarpiece of Kalmar Cathedral. Most of the furnishings of the church also date from the 17th and 18th centuries. The oldest item in the church is a small triumphal cross from the early 14th century. The father of the Swedish poet Erik Johan Stagnelius was a priest at the church for some years, and the poet spent his childhood in the nearby parsonage. In 1924, a memorial stone was erected near the church in commemoration of the poet, with a portrait medallion executed by Arvid K√§llstr√∂m. The church was also the venue for the marriage between Princess Margaretha of Sweden and John Ambler, an English businessman, in 1964.

The single, featuring two non-album tracks, was the band's follow-up to their debut album Get Back; the band had toured heavily around Australia in the interim. The single was released on 20 August 2004, and features the band's original line-up of Kris Schroeder, Wally de Backer, and Michael Hubbard, although Hubbard had departed the band in June 2004, after the completion of the recording. Tim Heath had since joined the band on a permanent basis; hence, \\"Call It Rhythm and Blues/Baby, Let Me In\\" was the last Basics release to feature Michael Hubbard in any capacity. Background In mid-2003, Schroeder and De Backer were preparing material for a follow-up album to 2003's Get Back. The pair amassed twenty songs for potential use, including \\"Inside Your Walls\\", \\"I Loved U, U Left Me\\", \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\", and \\"I'm Gonna Tell Ya 'Bout a Girl\\". In 2003, the band recorded demos of these four tracks - these recordings would eventually be released on the 2013 anthology Leftovers. In early 2004, the band recorded two tracks at Metropolis Studios, Melbourne - out of the band's backlog of twenty unused songs, \\"Call It Rhythm and Blues\\" and \\"Baby, Let Me In\\" were nominated for recording by producer Matthew Gearing-Thomas. Where Get Back was recorded and mixed in mono, \\"Call It Rhythm and Blues/Baby, Let Me In\\" was the first Basics release to make use of stereo mixing. From this point forward, every release by the band would use stereo sound. Like on Get Back, the Basics served as producers for this release, this time alongside Matthew Gearing-Thomas, who also engineered and mixed the recording. The album was mastered by John Cochrane. In keeping with the original cover art for Get Back, which alludes to the Beatles' debut album, the artwork for \\"Call It Rhythm and Blues\\"/\\"Baby, Let Me In\\" is an homage to the cover of the Beatles' second album, With the Beatles. The black and white photograph, showing the band members in darkness with faces half lit by harsh light, was taken by Melbourne photographer James Bryans. Release The single was never officially released - rather, independently produced pressings of it were sold as merchandise at live shows. \\"Call It Rhythm and Blues\\" has proven an enduring live number in the band's repertoire. A live rendition of the song recorded in 2007 at the Esplanade Hotel, St. Kilda appears on the band's 2007 EP Lookin' Over My Shoulder - in addition to three core members Schroeder, De Backer, and Heath, the recording also features occasional touring keyboardist, David Bramble. The same recording was favoured over the 2004 studio recording for inclusion on the 2012 compilation, Ingredients. The song was also recorded as the closing number on 2013 live album and concert video, My Brain's Off (And I Like It). In late 2008, while recording their third album Keep Your Friends Close, the Basics attempted a new recording of \\"Baby, Let Me In\\". This version featured Schroeder playing drums, and Heath playing a Farfisa keyboard, as well as electric guitar. The song was ultimately not used for the album. The original studio recording of \\"Baby, Let Me In\\" was re-issued on the 2013 rarities compilation, Leftovers. Additionally, the compilation included an instrumental mix of the 2008 re-recording.

It is an epiphytic orchid with creeping stems, gherkin-like leaves and flowering stems with up to eighteen cream-coloured, yellowish or greenish white flowers with purple stripes. It often grows on large trees near streams but is also found in drier forests. Description Dendrobium cucumerinum is an epiphytic herb with creeping stems thick with widely spaced leaves. The leaves are long, wide, thick and fleshy with many irregular bumps on the surface, giving them the appearance of a small cucumber or gherkin. Between two and eighteen cream- coloured, yellowish or greenish white, sometimes foul smelling flowers long and wide are arranged on a flowering stem long. The sepals and petals are irregularly twisted and have reddish purple streaks near their bases. The sepals are long and about wide, whilst the petals are about the same length but only half as wide. The labellum is white with purple marks and curved, long, wide and has three lobes. The side lobes are upright and the middle lobe is very wavy with three wavy ridges along its midline. Flowering occurs from November to February. Taxonomy and naming Illustration from Curtis's Botanical Magazine Dendrobium cucumerinum was first formally described in 1842 by William MacLeay and the description was published by John Lindley in Edwards's Botanical Register. Macleay had collected the specimen growing on swamp oak (Casuarina glauca) at Brownlow Hill. Lindley noted \\"Of all the queer things which this strange order produces this is one of the very oddest. Only fancy a handful of little stunted cucumbers lying in a heap, and producing a few pale dirty-yellow striped flowers in the midst, and you have this plant before the eye\\". The specific epithet (cucumeriaum) is derived from the Latin word cucumis meaning \\"cucumber\\". Lindley recorded the name \\"W.MacLeay\\" with the description, but William Woolls noted in 1867 that \\"Dendrobium Cucumerinum was found by the late Mr.W.S.Macleay, near Brownlow Hill, growing on the swamp oak\\". Dendrobium cucumerinum has been recorded hybridising with the straggly pencil orchid (Dendrobium bowmanii) where they grow together. Distribution and habitat The cucumber orchid usually grows on Casuarina cunninghamiana trees but sometimes also on other species of tree and on rocks. It occurs between Jimna in Queensland and Picton in New South Wales, also as far inland as Armidale and the Blue Mountains.

It also discusses the \\"on location\\" shooting of Hollywood films in Asia. It was published by University of Michigan Press. Background Jeanette Roan is an associate professor of Visual Studies & Visual and Critical Studies at California College of the Arts, Oakland, California.  Content  Roan begins her book with a discussion about the feature film The Good Earth (1937). In the publicity for the film it was claimed that viewing the film once was equal to all that a person would come to know and experience from a whole year's journey in China. However, the film was actually shot in San Fernando Valley. Roan goes on to discuss Elias Burton Holmes, an expert who gave lectures on topics including \\"The Hawaiian Islands\\" and \\"The Forbidden City\\", which depicted the Chinese, Philippine and inhabitants of Pacific islands. The portrayal of Asians in American films and the images they created in the minds of the audience are discussed. Analysis of \\"on-location shooting\\" of films from the last decade of the nineteenth century to 1960s is presented. She views that the concept of imperialism has changed into that of democracy and globalism. Thomas Edison's Occidental and Oriental Series has also been critically analyzed. Alterations brought by the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and the Boxer Uprising in the depiction of Asian Americans is also discussed. A final chapter focuses on the consequences that the Occupation of Japan had on Hollywood films. The usage of Japan as a shooting spot has been discussed by citing the examples of Tokyo File 212 (1951), Three Stripes in the Sun (1955), Teahouse of the August Moon (1956), Sayonara (1957), and My Geisha (1962). In her conclusion, Roan analyses David Cronenberg's M. Butterfly (1993), shot on location in Hungary, China, France, and Canada, and posits her reasons for the negative reception of the feature. She states that the previous Hollywood films shot in China showed the country's scenic beauty and tourist attractions to their audiences, but Cronenberg, contrary to the expectations of film viewers, focused more on the characters, narrative, and story. A few contemporary critics questioned the need for location shooting in China.  Reception  Monica Rico wrote in the journal Film & History that \\"Envisioning Asia deserves to be widely read and assigned\\" and that the author relies \\"perhaps a bit too heavily on quotations\\" from others. Kent A. Ono (in American Quarterly) opined that Roan had \\"[emphasized] context itself\\", taking a cultural studies approach to her study of ‚Äúon location‚Äù cinema and concluded by saying that \\"Roan questions the very need and rationale for the authenticity that location shooting ostensibly allows and provides.\\"  References   Bibliography    2010 non-fiction books American non-fiction books English-language books Books about film ","title":"Envisioning Asia"},{"id":"48671697","text":"The Auschwitz Combat Group (, ) was international left-wing resistance organization in Auschwitz concentration camp.

Completed in 1035 AD by Rajendra Chola I as a part of his new capital, this Chola dynasty era temple is similar in design, and has a similar name, as the older 11th century, Brihadeeswarar Temple about to the southwest in Thanjavur. The Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple is smaller yet more refined than the Thanjavur Temple. Both are among the largest Shiva temples in South India and examples of Dravidian style temples. The temple is also referred to in texts as Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple or Gangaikondacholeeswaram Temple The main. temple dedicated to Shiva is based on a square plan, but it reverentially displays other Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Durga, Surya, Harihara, Ardhanarishvara, and others.Great Living Chola Temples , Archaeological Survey of India, Government of IndiaPV Jagadisa Ayyar (1993), South Indian Shrines, Asian Educational Services, , pages 291-295 It opens to the sunrise and its sanctum, as well as the mandapas, are aligned on an east-west axis. In addition to the main shrine, the temple complex has a number of smaller shrines, gopura, and other monuments, with some partially ruined or restored in later centuries. The temple is famed for its bronze sculptures, artwork on its walls, the depiction of Nandi and the scale of its tower. As well as its notability for having been built by Rajendra I, the temple is also noteworthy for its numerous inscriptions, although none of them are his. Except for this temple, the old city of Gangaikonda Cholapuram ‚Äì the capital of a powerful Asian empire from around AD 900 to AD 1215 or over three centuries along with its other major Chola-era Hindu temples have been completely destroyed, leaving a desolate place. The Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple remains an active temple. Four daily rituals, and many yearly festivals are held there, of which the Shivarathri during the Tamil month of Masi (February‚ÄìMarch), Aipassi Pournami during Aipassi (October‚Äì November) and Thiruvadirai during Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary) are the most prominent. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) administers the temple as a protected heritage monument. UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site in 2004, along with the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur and Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram. These are referred to collectively as the Great Living Chola Temples. Location alt=image of a road with the temple on the right side The Brihadeeswarar Temple is located near the village of Gangaikonda Cholapuram, about southwest of Chennai and from Chidambaram. Roughly to the northeast is the similarly named Chola dynasty era Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur, and is about to the northeast of the Airavatesvara Temple. All three are UNESCO world heritage sites. The temple is on Highway 81 connecting Tiruchirappalli and Chidambaram. The nearby city of Chidambaram is connected to other major cities by daily trains on the Indian railway network, Tamil Nadu bus services and National Highways 36, 81, and 245. The nearest airport with regular services is Tiruchirappalli International Airport (IATA: TRZ), about away. Though inland, the temple is near the Kollidam River, within the Cauveri River delta with access to the Bay of Bengal and through it to the Indian Ocean. Description alt=the pyramidal structure above the sanctum alt=the shrine of Vinayaga with the main shrine in the background Architecture Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple is built in Dravidian style of architecture with a square plan. The original courtyard is two squares stacked next to each other, all mandapas, the upapitham, the shrine plans, the garbha griha (sanctum) and the tower elements are all square shaped and incorporate circles and principles of geometric symmetry. The structural elements resemble the big Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur. Both include a courtyard entered through multiple gateways and relatively small gopuram (tower). Inside are shrines, most of which are aligned on an east-west axis; a few are perpendicular. The temple complex includes Nandi Mandapa, Alankar Mandapa, Maha Mandapa, Mukha Mandapa and Ardha Mandapa. Some of these were added and restored by Hindu kingdoms after the 14th century or by British India art conservation officials in the 19th century. The visible upapitham measures long by with an east-west axis, but part of it is likely missing with the surviving foundation covered by soil and with a restored surface for tourism. On the visible part, states Balasubrahmanyam, the garbha griha (sanctum) is long, the maha mandapa (great hall) is long, and the ardha mandapa (partial hall) is . The square-shaped ardha mandapa connects the sanctum and the great hall. The temple is one of the earliest ones to have pillared halls, which became a common feature in subsequent temples. The main temple is built on an elevated structure with the courtyard measuring by . Its sanctum measures and is entered through the Ardha Mandapa . The sanctum doorway is flanked by dvarapalas, the guardians, each tall. The sanctum contains Brihadeeswarar (Shiva) in the form of lingam. This lingam is tall and the base has a circumference of . There is an image of a seated Nandi bull in the courtyard, aligned axially facing the sanctum. There are five shrines around the sanctum and a Lion well, which was added during the 19th century. The temple site has a monolithic representation of Navagrahas, the nine planetary deities. Sri-vimana The vimanam (temple tower) is high, which is smaller than the Thanjavur Temple. Historians believe that the height of the temple is deliberately kept low in dimensions compared to the Thanjavur temple as a mark of respect of Rajendra to his father's masterpiece. Compared to the Thanjavur Temple, which has straight contours, this temple has a curvilinear contour, slightly concave towards the top. It is divided into eight zones. The tower rises as a vertical square structure to a height of above the adhisthanam. It has two horizontal bands with a massive cornice wrapped around it. Each band has five individual bays on the south, west and east sides with pilasters between the bays. The end bays are squares, the other three are oblong. The center bay of each set of five being the widest. On each side are carvings on the wall with four horizontal rows of friezes. These narrate Hindu legends and Puranic mythologies from the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta traditions. Each storey has moulded horizontal projections (cornices) with floral arch-shaped motifs (gavaksha). According to Balasubrahmanyam, incorporated in the features are mythical creatures in the form of yali, and the entablature is decorated with necklace shaped motifs. The Sri-vimana at Gangaikonda has nine storeys (talas) including those at the lower levels, in contrast to the thirteen storeys at Thanjavur. Each storey has a square-circle-oblong artwork. The upper levels repeat the lower level design in a rhythmic shrinking pattern. The symmetry principles are dutifully embedded in, but the rate of shrinking is not linear with height. The lower storeys shrink faster than the upper storeys. This gives the vimana an uncommon parabolic form. The griva (neck) is oriented towards the cardinal directions, and like the Thanjavur Temple, Nandi bulls sit on its top corners. Above the griva is the kirtimukhas, then a symmetric open lotus. The tower is capped with a kalasa, whose inscription was once gold coated; the gold is long gone. Above the kalasa is a lotus bud greeting the sky. Sculpture There are about fifty sculptural reliefs around the walls of the sanctum, three of which ‚Äî Nataraja, Saraswati and Shiva garlanding a devotee ‚Äî being the most prominent. There is a shrine for Shaiva saint and scholar Chandeshvara (one of the sixty-three Nayanars). There are other niches around the temple walls depicting various forms of Shiva, Durga and Vishnu. There are many bronze statues in the temple depicting Chola art of the 11th century, with the one of Kartikeya being the most recognisable. One relief includes a most unusual portrait of a Hindu ruler who built the temple. Shiva, with Parvati beside him, hands down a garland of flowers to mark his victory to a diminutive seated figure of Rajendra I.Michell, 53 History The temple was constructed in 1035 AD by Rajendra Chola I (1014-44 CE), the son of the famous Chola king Raja Raja Chola I, who built the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur. Some experts believe that the temple was built during 1020, during the 6th regnal year, but inscriptions indicate the 20th regnal year, which is 1035 AD. Rajendra wanted to emulate the temple built by his father after his victory in a campaign across India that Chola era texts state covered Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Bengal. After his victory, he demanded that the defeated kingdoms send pots of Ganges River water and pour them into the temple's well. The well was originally called Cholagangam as it was filled with water from Ganges. Shiva shown garlanding king Rajendra I Rajendra I, as is Tamil tradition, then assumed the name Gangaikonda Cholan, meaning the one who conquered the Ganges. He established Gangaikonda Cholapuram as his capital from the earlier Chola capital of Thanjavur. Gangaikonda Cholapuram remained the Chola capital for the next 250 years. Rajendra I built the entire capital with several temples using plans and infrastructure recommended in Tamil Vastu and Agama Sastra texts. These included a Dharma Sasta, Vishnu and other temples. However, these structures were destroyed in the late 13th and 14th centuries except this temple. The other Chola landmarks, clearly shown by soil covered mounds and excavated broken pillar stumps and brick walls, are found over a large area nearby. The earliest inscription that mentions this city by name is dated 1029, while the earliest reference to Rajendra I's expedition towards the Ganges river in the north is dated 1023. The first gift to the newly built Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple is dated 1035. Rajendra I, states Dehejia, must have involved the same craftsmen used by his father and transferred them from Thanjavur. Most or all of the Chola kings from Rajendra I had their coronation at Gangaikonda Cholapuram. Archaeological excavations have revealed fort walls and palace remains a few kilometers from this temple. It is believed that Kulothunga Chola I, Rajendra's successor, built fortifications around the city. The reasons for the city's destruction are unclear. According to Vasanthi, the Pandyas who defeated the Cholas during the later part of 13th-century \\"may have razed the city to ground\\" to avenge their previous defeats. However, it is unclear why other temples were destroyed and this temple was spared, as well as why there are around twenty inscriptions from later Cholas, Pandyas and Vijayanagar Empires indicating various gifts and grants to this temple if they previously razed this place. An alternative theory links the destruction to the raids, plunder and wars, particularly with the invasion of the capital city and the territories, that were earlier a part of the Chola and Madurai Empires, by the armies of the Delhi Sultanate led by the Muslim commander Malik Kafur in 1311, followed by Khusrau Khan in 1314, and Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1327. The period that followed saw wars between the Hindu kings and the Muslim sultans who succeeded the Delhi Sultanate and carved out new states such as the nearby Madurai Sultanate (1335‚Äì1378). The Vijayanagara Empire defeated the Madurai Sultanate in 1378 and this temple, along with other Chola era temples, then returned to the control of Hindu kings who repaired and restored many of them. Texts Gangaikonda Cholpuram and the temple are mentioned in many of the contemporary works of the period like Muvar Ula and Kalingathuparani. Scholars like Vasanthi believe that the 11th century Tamil poet Kambar's description of Ayodhya was based on the streets and city structure of Gangaikonda Cholapuram. Similar correlation is derived based on the works of Sekkizhar in Periya Puranam. Muvar Ula, a treatise on the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas, provides a vivid account of the city and the temple. Like the Thanjavur temple, this temple is also believed to have emerged as a centre of social, economic and political activities. Cultural activities like music, dance and art in the form of bronzes were encouraged and staged in the temple. Today The Nandi facing the sanctum. The temple was added to the list of Great Living Chola Temples in the year 2004. All three temples were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries CE and have many similarities. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) made additions to the shopping and visitor attraction offices in the temple in 2009 that included a museum, restaurant, shops and restrooms under the aegis of the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temples are classified as Great Living Chola Temples as they are still visited, worshiped in and used as they were when they were constructed. The millennium celebration of the coronation of the Rajendra Chola was celebrated in the temple over two days during July 2014. Festivals and worship practises Though it is administered by the ASI as a monument, worship practises are followed similar to those at other Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. The temple follows Saivite tradition and the temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Arthajamam between 7:30 ‚Äì8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Brihadeeswarar and Periya Nayagi. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6:00 a.m.‚Äì12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.‚Äì9:00 p.m. every day. The temple has many festivals in its calendar, with the Shivarathri during the Tamil month of Masi (February‚ÄìMarch), Aipassi Pournami during Aipassi (October‚ÄìNovember) and Thiruvadirai during Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary) being the most prominent. Annabhishekam, the ablution of the presiding deity with cooked rice is performed during Aipasi festival.

He did take something from the works of John Walker. He concentrated on the Bedfordshire dialect, publishing in 1807 two works on orthoepy, one concerned with the dialect, bound together. They met with criticism in the Monthly Review, in 1810. A great-nephew of Thomas Gurney, Batchelor recorded conversations in shorthand, and invented an orthoepical alphabet.

Julius Motteler was a leading member of the early German Labour movement and was repeatedly elected a member of the Reichstag (German national parliament). During the period 1878 - 1890, defined politically in Germany by the Anti-Socialist Laws, he organised the party's underground press activities. He was also instrumental in the establishment of trades unions in Germany, and an early champion of the Proletarian Women's Movement (Proletarische Frauenbewegung). He was a member of the inner circle of left wing leaders that also included August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht. Motteler was a member of the Social Democratic Party, having already been a co-founder of several predecessor political parties, the Saxon People's Party, the Social Democratic Workers' Party and the German Socialist Worker's Party (Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands / SAP). Life Early years Julius Motteler was born the ninth of twelve children in Esslingen, some southeast of Stuttgart. His father was a prosperous hotelier. The boy attended the P√§dagogium (school) in Esslingen and prepared for a career as a teacher. However, his father died on July 1848 and four years later, in 1852, Julius Motteler quit the local teacher training college and embarked on an apprenticeship in the weaving trade. After he had completed his military service Motteler, who was by now a qualified weaver and textile (buckskin) worker, and also had some commercial training, moved to Augsburg in Bavaria where he gained experience as a book keeper and factory manager. He relocated again in 1859, this time to Saxony, taking a job in September of that year as a dispatcher and book keeper with a textiles company called \\"Vigonespinnerei Wolf & Kirsten\\" in Crimmitschau near Zwickau. Socialist beginnings In Saxony Motteler increasingly focused on trades union and political activities. In 1860 he joined the politically liberal German National Association, itself a precursor to a political party. This was where he first met August Bebel. In 1863 he was one of the founders of the Arbeiterbildungsverein (Workers' Educational Association) in Crimmitschau, which quickly became part of a nationwide movement. In the same year, with the creation of the Verband Deutscher Arbeitervereine (\\"Association of German Workers' Associations\\"), he gave expression to a separation of the workers' movement from what socialist innovators of the time would have identified as \\"Bourgeois liberalism\\". He adopted the programme drawn up by Karl Marx for the First International as a political road map. In 1866 he was a founding member with August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht of the Saxon People's Party. The next year he lost his job with \\"Wolf & Kirsten\\" who objected to his election campaigning, and joined \\"Spinn- und Webgenossenschaft Ernst Stehfest & Co\\", still in Crimmitschau, working as a buyer. He was not alone in losing his job for political reasons, and his new employer was a co-operative enterprise, founded on 8 July 1867 by a number of textile workers who had lost their previous jobs for political campaigning. The sector and the region were booming, and the new enterprise was initially successful, but it closed through insolvency in 1876. Motteler had stood as a guarantor for the cooperative. In 1867 Julius Motteler and Karl Wilhelm Stolle jointly established the \\"Crimmitschau Republican People's Union\\" (\\"Crimmitschauer Republikanischen Volksverein\\"), as the local branch of the Saxon People's Party. He played a part in sending workers' delegates to the Reichstag of the short-lived North German Confederation. In 1869 he participated, with August Bebel, in the founding in Eisenach of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands / SDAP), which turned out to be a precursor of the SPD. Shortly afterwards he established a local party branch in Crimmitschau, in 1868 dissolving the local Arbeiterbildungsverein (Workers' Educational Association) to make way for the new SDAP. In May 1869 Motteler was a founder, in Leipzig, of the \\"Trades Union of Manufacturing, Industrial and Craft workers of both sexes\\" (\\"Gewerksgenossenschaft der Manufactur-, Fabrik- und Handarbeiter beiderlei Geschlechts\\") which quickly became one of the country's largest trades unions, although it proved short-lived, being closed down by the police on 10 December 1878, after the legislators outlawed trades unions in 1878. Nevertheless, in the longer term this union can be seen as a forerunner of the German Textile Workers' Union (\\"Deutscher Textilarbeiterverband\\") founded in 1891 following the lifting of the Anti-Socialist Laws (although later closed down by the Nazis in 1933). In addition to campaigning actively for women's rights long before most of the issues involved found their way into mainstream socialist politics, Motteler also argued vehemently against the use of child labour in factories. He actively backed the creation of various consumer cooperatives, workers' associations and labour unions. With Stolle, in 1870 he founded a co- operative printing press to produce the \\"Crimmitschau Citizens' and Farmers' Friend\\" (\\"Crimmitschauer B√ºrger- und Bauernfreund\\"), identified by some as Germany's first regional Social Democratic newspaper. During the 1870s he was involved with the establishment of a printing co-operative in Leipzig between 1874 and 1876, and in Barmen in 1877. He resigned from chairmanship of the Leipzig 1876 for personal reasons in 1876. National politics Following unification, in 1874 Julius Motteler was elected to the Reichstag for the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands / SDAP), one of several parties which underwent successive mergers to become, in 1890, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He was elected to represent the \\"Zwickau Werdau Glauchau Crimmitschau\\" electoral district. On 22 May 1875 was one of the founders of the German Socialist Worker's Party (Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands / SAP) which resulted from the merger of the SDAP with the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiter-Verein / ADAV). He sat as a Reichstag member for the combined party till he lost his seat in 1878. By 1878 the chancellor, whose tolerance of liberalism and socialism had always may always have been largely tactical, felt able to revert to the comfortable conservatism of the Junker class into which he had been born. The \\"Gesetz gegen die gemeingef√§hrlichen Bestrebungen der Sozialdemokratie\\" known in English language sources as the Anti-Socialist Laws was/were one particularly far-reaching manifestation. A more personal manifestation of the new political climate followed a speech Motteler gave on 4 and 5 June 1878 in which he protested against state sponsored defamation of the SDAP. The speech, which came in the wake of two serious (albeit failed) assassination attempts against the Kaiser was very widely reported. As the political heat increased Motteler found himself arrested in Stuttgart on 29 September 1878 and charged with \\"Kaiserbeleidigung\\" (disrespecting the Kaiser): however, he was acquitted. Later in 1878 he relocated - as matters turned out briefly - to the Nymphenburg district of Munich. Z√ºrich exile, London exile The Anti- Socialist Laws that came into force in October 1878 were a watered down version of the original proposal that Bismarck had tried, and failed, to get through the Reichstag in May 1878. They nevertheless included or were accompanied by a range of repressive measures including the outlawing of trades unions and the closing down of 45 leftwing journals and newspapers. Social Democrats responded by standing for election not as SAP members but as independent candidates, while a number of prominent party members relocated to Switzerland where there was no ban on producing Social Democratic newspapers for distribution in Germany. Motteler moved, with his wife Emilie, to Z√ºrich in November 1879 from where he organised the production of Der Sozialdemokrat (a weekly newspaper), and its distribution into W√ºrttemberg and from there, using an increasingly sophisticated network of trusted \\"Red postmen\\", right across Germany, earning himself the soubriquet \\"der Roter Feldpostmeister\\" (\\"The red army postmaster\\"). From Z√ºrich he also headed up \\"Schwarzen Maske\\" (\\"Black Masks\\"), a counter-espionage outfit intended to counteract German spying activities against the group of exiled social democrats in Switzerland. Motteler's management experience, his meticulous attention to detail and his sheer talent for conspiratorial organisation were important to the success of the newspaper venture, and also enabled him to unmask several German government spies operating within the group. Although, or possibly because, distribution in Germany of the newspaper printed in Switzerland took place outside the law, the 1880s saw a maintained, and in the view of some commentators an intensified national Social Democratic identity in which the activities of the Z√ºrich exiles played an important part. Someone who undoubtedly appreciated the effectiveness of the Social Democratic caucus in exile was the German Chancellor who eventually managed to persuade the Swiss national government to expel the team producing \\"Der Sozialdemokrat\\". The team arrived in London in June 1888, accompanied by 16 large crates of scrupulously archived and indexed documentation. \\"Der Sozialdemokrat\\" was printed in London from October 1888 till September 1890. By this time relations within the team producing the newspaper had become acutely frayed, while back in Germany Bismarck had finally retired, in March 1890. The retirement came about after the Reichstag had refused, in January 1890, to renew the Anti-Socialist Laws, which had come to be seen increasingly as wrong, ineffective or counter- productive. Early in 1891 Julius Motteler organised the crating up and transfer to Berlin of a portion of the by now prodigious \\"archive\\" accumulated during the years of exile. He nevertheless retained many of the party records, since for Motteler himself the London exile was not over. His listing, in German police files, as an outlaw was not at this point rescinded, and he therefore continued, with fellow exile Eduard Bernstein to operate from London a highly effective branch in exile of the Social Democratic Party which was now relegitimised in Germany. Return from exile Motteler and Germany were finally able to return to Germany in 1901. Thanks to their enforced absence they had been unable to play a leading role in the SPD's formative decade. Motteler was accompanied by more Social Democratic documentation, and he also organised the repatriation of all the archived documents from the Marx-Engels of which he had been given charge following the death, in exile in London in August 1895, of Friedrich Engels. On returning to Germany Motteler immediately returned to the newspaper business, becoming the printing manager and publishing director of the Leipziger Volkszeitung (newspaper). In the 1903 General Election he won a Leipzig seats for the Social Democrats, and he sat in the Reichstag till 1907. He died a few months after the 1907 election, having remained active as a social democratic activist and newspaper manager almost to the end. Personal Between 1870 and 1878 Julius Motteler was married to Emilie Henriette Kyber from Crimmitschau. Later he was married to Emilie Schwarze from Esslingen. With his first wife he had one recorded son, who died of Typhus in 1879.

Naval service War with France ended on 10 February 1763, after Mecklenburghs purchase but before completion of her fitout or assembling of her crew. Despite this, commissioning went ahead in April 1763 and the vessel entered the Navy as a patrol cutter off the Sussex coast. Her first commander was Lieutenant Henry I'Anson, formerly 1st lieutenant of , subsequently commander of the first , who served aboard Mecklenburgh until 1765. In 1766 command passed to Lieutenant Thomas Parke, and in 1769 to Lieutenant William Hills.

In 1974 the 3 Brothers sold their equity and retired from the wine business. Subsequently, SVF was acquired by Pernod Ricard Jacquillat Thierry, 2005, \\"Fais vite, ne traine pas en route\\", Edition Albin Michel then the Castel Group.

The dancers dance in groups, rotating the plates carefully so that the plate is always horizontal, and the candles are not extinguished. The dance is said to have originated in Sumatra, Indonesia. History The origin of this dance is inseparable from folklore. In the folklore told in ancient times there was a girl who was left by her fiance to go trading. One day the girl lost her engagement ring, then she searched for it until late at night by using a candle placed on a plate. In her search for the ring, the girl must intensify the trip to the yard, and she must bend to illuminate the ground and sometimes the girl's movements look like they are twisting and turning so they look like beautiful dance moves. It was from here that this Candle Dance was born and began to be known among the village girls. Candle Dance Function The function of the Candles Dance is only for traditional events, namely to convey gratitude to God for the results and win that the community gets. Along with the times, the function of Dance Candles are now not only support for traditional events, but also as arts and entertainment.

Begun in 1834 and altered and enlarged until about 1950, it is a well-preserved example of a New England connected farmstead, a property type that has become increasingly rare in Maine. The farm, at a fraction of its greatest extent, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The Mortland Family Farm is located in rural inland Searsport, on the east side of Mortland Road. Surviving elements of the farmstead include the 1834 Greek Revival stone Cape style farmhouse, two 19th- century barns, and wood-frame ells joining the elements. A modern (1950s) dairy shed is attached to one of the barns, and the also includes a cellar hole believed to be the site of the first house on the property. The property includes two meadows, formerly in agricultural use, and a remnant apple orchard. The property was first settled in the 1820s by the family of Samuel Mortland, an Irish immigrant, who at first lived in a crude log structure. In 1834 he built the surviving rubblestone Cape. The property was owned by five generations of Mortlands, and was sold out of the family in 1985. At its greatest extent, the farm in the 1850s consisted of more than of land, and it is during the 1860s that the house was enlarged. The barns were added in the 1890s, one of them built with materials salvaged from a nearby older barn. In the 20th century the farm was primarily as a dairy operation.

Paul (April 22, 1907 ‚Äì September 18, 2005) was a puppeteer best known for his traveling show and television broadcasts of \\"Paul's Puppets\\". His marionette show ran for 10 years on WBAL-TV in Baltimore. In 1931 he performed the first known children's television show. Paul also did the first professional puppet show for a United States president when he performed at the White House for Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife in 1934.  Early life  Bernard Paul, Bernard Paul was born on April 22, 1907, in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Henry James Paul and Mary Paul. He was born in a private hospital called Bidler and Sellman. He went by the nickname \\"Bernie\\". The family lived in Baltimore on Lanvale Street for a while and later moved to a house on Gilmore Street. They moved to a neighborhood called Linthicum Heights in 1919 when Paul was 12 years old. Paul's father designed and built the house that was located on Hawthorne Road. That homesite had many flower and vegetable gardens. Paul attended Linthicum Elementary School, where he first met his future wife, Edith \\"Edee\\" Rogers.  Education and marriage  After Paul's graduation from the eighth grade his family had moved out of the area where Edith lived and he lost contact with her at this time. Paul had then attended Baltimore City College for a year. For the next three years he then went to Severn Preparatory School in Severna Park, Maryland, from which he graduated in 1925. Paul then enrolled at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) where he was reunited with Edee. He studied stagecraft and she was a student of costume design and became a professional seamstress. They graduated from MICA in 1929.ProQuest (909635346), The Baltimore Sun, \\"Couple keeps friends in drawers, in strings\\" by Donna Weaver (27 April 1986) Paul and Edee were married on April 17, 1930, in his parents' home on Hawthorne Road in Linthicum. They lived there for their entire lives. They had two sons who were raised there as the third generation in the same house. Peter Darr was their first son, born on January 21, 1933. Larry Ramon was their second child, born on July 10, 1935.  Career  Paul had changed his mind of becoming a college-trained professional in stagecraft sometime in the late 1920s. This happened after seeing a puppet performance of Tony Sarg at Goucher College. He then decided on a career in puppetry. Paul associated himself with Sarg and obtained marionette puppet ideas and skills. In a short time they became friends. From Sarg's unique training he and his wife learned to stage puppet shows at the Maryland Institute College of Art. The faculty was so impressed with their performances that they began teaching puppetry, and a teaching stint spanning almost two decades followed.  Paul's Puppets  The Pauls manipulating their puppets in December 1949 Paul, along with his wife Edee, started a traveling puppet show in 1930 called Paul's Puppets. With their combined puppetry talents they managed every step of the process for each performance. Paul, with his skills, designed and built the puppet sets and marionettes. Edee created the puppets' scripts and their costumes. Paul had a separate 45' by 16' workshop studio that was part of their personal residence he added in 1952.ProQuest (1637460113), The Baltimore Sun (15 Jan 1989) \\"Puppeteers spread good cheer\\" by Jill L Zarend In the studio he created the marionettes that were made from pine, which included the flexible wooden joints for the puppets. The marionette heads were from plaster wood. The rough block heads were individually crafted, specifically shaped, finished, painted up, and decorated with hair. His wife would add her custom-designed costumes just before being attached to an overhead controller by strings. Paul's Puppets consisted of a company of some 500 marionettes, including animals, fairies, giants, princes, princesses and soldiers.ProQuest (542342634), The Baltimore Sun, 14 Feb 1960, \\"The Biggest family in Maryland\\" by Gerald H. Borstel The performances were adaptations of the Arabian Nights, Aesop's fables, Daniel Defoe, Beatrix Potter, John Ruskin, Mark Twain and Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales. Other plays were of Snow White, Red Riding Hood, Butterfly that Stamped, Undersen and Taps, and The Wizard Prince.ProQuest (540624352), The Baltimore Sun (April 6, 1930) \\"Marionettes play at Guild Theater\\". The performances represented countries from around the world.ProQuest (539569700), The Baltimore Sun, \\"Marionettes on Display at Institute ‚Äì represents many countries\\" (16 Nov 1930). The marionette puppets were carefully stored when not performing. A son had noted that the family could never play with the hand-crafted marionettes because they were stage props and not children's toys. The performances in the first years had musical accompaniment from 78-rpm records. The sound effect techniques improved later and included music tapes. Paul and his wife were the voices for their marionette characters. Paul worked as an assistant Post Master at a U.S. Post Office in 1940 giving puppet shows with his marionettes on his off times. The Pauls did performances at Army posts and aboard Navy ships during World War II. They also did puppet acts on college campuses, in retail store windows, at country clubs, local schools and churches. Notable performances they did later consisted of one in an opera at the Peabody Conservatory and another in a Shakespeare play.ProQuest (543298422), The Baltimore Sun, \\"Vagabonds to Produce Play by Shakespeare\\" (16 October 1932) In their performances they mocked things like candy, politicians, and Social Security. The Pauls started television for WMAR in late 1947 when they did a commercial with their marionettes. Paul's Puppets then made a 15-minute debut on WBAL-TV on January 8, 1948, in preparation for a twice-weekly show that ran for ten years. It was sponsored by Hutzler's department store. Other sponsors were Nestle's Ever Ready Sweet Milk Cocoa and Planters Peanuts. The first shows came with theme music of \\"March of the Little Fawns\\". The later ones came with music from The Nutcracker. Paul once told a friend that though the television show was considered a success, he missed having a live audience. One noted marionette character that many remember was JoJo. It was a red, white, and blue clown puppet that had interviews with audience children as the master of ceremonies before going \\"live\\" with the show. WBAL began showing the performances in color in 1955. In 1957 the station changed its programming to a news-weather program in Paul's Puppets evening time period. The puppet performances were moved to a morning time slot and the show floundered because the targeted audience of children were in school. Their television career ended in 1958, but they still did live performances at the Hutzler's stores. The Pauls made display windows in later years for department stores like Hochschild's and Hutzler's. The display windows consisted of still doll-like figures that did not move as their marionette puppets did. One display was of the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Another store display showed shoppers on Howard Street in Baltimore at the turn of the twentieth century.  Hobbies  Paul had several hobbies. Among them were carving, collecting, photography, making jewelry and woodworking. He was a collector with wide-ranging interests, including bells and gongs, butterflies, buttons, masks, old music boxes, swords, Oriental objects, toy soldiers and ancient puppets. He had a photography darkroom in his house and developed his own pictures.  Retirement and death  The Pauls performed puppet shows in schools, hospitals and department stores until retiring in 1981. Paul's wife died on November 2, 1993. Paul remained at the Hawthorne Road home in Linthicum until he was 96. He then moved to an assisted living facility. Paul died on September 18, 2005, at the age of 98.  Legacy  Paul and his wife had a television career in the Baltimore area for ten years on TV stations WBAL and WMAR. Their puppet show was the first Baltimore color television show. It was also chosen to be in the first edition of TV Guide for Baltimore as the featured program. Paul was a guest on the American television panel game show To Tell the Truth on March 19, 1965. Since he misspelled the name of a well-known puppet, none of the panelists guessed he was Bernard H. Paul of Paul's Puppets. Paul performed the first known children's television show. It aired November 6, 1931, over television station W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland. Paul and his wife did the first professional puppet show at the White House.ProQuest, The Baltimore Sun (April 1, 1934) ‚Äì \\"Paul's Puppets playing at the White House\\" It was done with their marionettes for President Franklin D.

He composed the work in D minor. It is the only major work for string quartet of his mature period.  History  As a student, Sibelius composed several works for string quartet. In 1885 he finished a string quartet in E-flat major, followed in 1889, after quite a few individual movements for this combination, by a string quartet in A minor. The first string quartet to receive an opus number was in 1890 the quartet Op. 4 in B-flat major. Afterwards he wrote no string quartets until ' in 1909. Composed between his Third and Fourth Symphony, it remained \\"the only major work for string quartet of Sibelius's mature period\\". Sibelius composed the quartet from December 1908, working on it in London in early 1909. The Latin title, translating to \\"Intimate Voices\\" or \\"Inner voices\\", marks a \\"conversational quality\\" and \\"inwardness\\" of the music. The composer wrote about his work in a letter to his wife: \\"It turned out as something wonderful. The kind of thing that brings a smile to your lips at the hour of death. I will say no more.\\" Sibelius showed it to his publisher Robert Lienau on 15 April 1909. The first performance was on 25 April 1910 at the Helsinki Music Institute. A review in the Helsingin Sanomat noted: \\"The composition attracted a great deal of attention, and it is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant products in its field. It is not a composition for the public at large, it is so eccentric and out of the ordinary.\\" Sibelius later wrote about the composition: \\"The melodic material is good but the harmonic material could be 'lighter', and even 'more like a quartet.'\\"  Structure and music  Sibelius structured the quartet in five movements: The work opens with a dialogue of violin and cello. The first movement contrasts \\"murmurous figuration with firm chords\\". The second movement is a scherzo in A major, connected to the first by musical motifs. The central slow movement has been described as a \\"soulful quest for serenity in F major\\". It contains \\"three detached, soft chords in E minor, remote from any of the previous harmonic implications\\", to which Sibelius added the \\"\\" in a friend's score. A second scherzo is also connected by motivic similarity to the first movement. The finale, \\"with more than a hint of folk fiddling\\", grows in intensity by markings from Allegro to \\"sempre pi√π energico\\" (always more energetic), described as \\"fiercely accented music of forceful contrasts but irresistible momentum\\". Arrangements The Finnish violinist and composer Pekka Kuusisto has arranged the work for chamber orchestra, which was included in Kuusisto's 2009 Australian tour with the Australian Chamber Orchestra.Anna King Murdoch, \\"An aural homecoming\\", The Age, 14 March 2009, A2, p. 16  Literature  * Beat F√∂llmi (ed.): Das Streichquartett in der ersten H√§lfte des 20.

Career Benjamin is known for her debut novel The Thing About Jellyfish, which was a National Book Award for Young People's Literature finalist in 2015, and a New York Times Best Seller. The Thing about Jellyfish is the story of a girl named Suzy who becomes convinced that her friend's accidental drowning was the result of a rare jellyfish sting and not just a random tragedy. The story follows Suzy as she decided to stop speaking in the wake of the loss and as she does whatever it takes to prove her theory correct. The book has been optioned for film by Reese Witherspoon's production company Pacific Standard, which is a production company dedicated to giving female stories a stronger voice within Hollywood. The novel has received attention as a book that could encourage girls to consider careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. Benjamin has expressed in interviews that the scientific aspects of the novel were born out of a failed attempt to write a non-fiction book about jellyfish for adults. The Thing about Jellyfish has received reviews from Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, Booklist, School Library Journal, and Shelf Awareness. The book was named by the New York Times as one of twenty-five notable children's books of 2015. Benjamin is the co-author of Tim Howard‚Äôs The Keeper: The Unguarded Story of Tim Howard (2014), and Paige Rawl‚Äôs Positive: A Memoir (2014), which is a coming-of-age memoir that was a Junior Library Guild selection and the first-ever nonfiction selection for The Today Show book club.

A relatively recent case of stolen goods sold there was in the early 1990s when several portraits by well-known eighteenth-century portrait painters, stolen from Lincoln's Inn,https://apnews.com/21d7526709b818873b44561e39d98567 each sold for less than ¬£100 from an outside stall. Since they had been sold in 'market overt', the purchaser could keep them. To quote Minister for the Arts Estelle Morris in July 2003 during the Second Reading of the Dealing In Cultural Objects (Offences) Bill: :I did not have information about march√© ouvert in the deep recesses of my mind, but experts reliably inform me that it no longer exists. The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) will be surprised to learn that it has been abolished only recently. It used to exist in designated markets, including Bermondsey. I am sure that the promoter will be interested in telling the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) about that. In it, items could be sold . Believe it or not, in this land of ours, people could sell stolen‚Äîmy officials put \\"dodgy\\" in brackets, but we do not use that term‚Äîobjects. I assure hon. Members that it has been abolished. I hope that that deals with the fears of the hon. Member for Uxbridge.

A flotilla of samurai under the daimy≈ç Matsura Takanobu attacked two Portuguese trade vessels that had shunned Matsura's port in Hirado and had gone instead to trade at Fukuda (now within Nagasaki), a port belonging to the rival ≈åmura Sumitada. The engagement was part of a process of trial and error by the Portuguese traders to find a safe harbour for their carracks in Japan that eventually brought them to Nagasaki. Background In 1543, Europeans reached Japan for the first time when a junk belonging to the Chinese wokou pirate lord Wang Zhi carrying Portuguese traders shipwrecked on Tanegashima. The Portuguese introduced the arquebus to the Japanese during this chance encounter, which gave the Japanese, undergoing the bloody Sengoku period at the time, a powerful weapon with which they conducted their internecine wars. The discovery of Japan was attractive to Portuguese merchants and missionaries alike, for it gave the merchants a new market to trade their goods, and the Jesuit missionaries eyed Japan for new converts into Christianity. The warlords of Kyushu vied to get the Portuguese carrack (called the black ship by the Japanese) into their harbours, since the ship also brought considerable wealth to their fiefdoms in addition to the guns. The Portuguese initially made Hirado their preferred port of call, since it was familiar to their wokou partners, although they also visited the ports of Kagoshima, Yamagawa, Hiji, and Funai from time to time. The Jesuits felt that the carrack should take turns visiting each port of Kyushu so the priests could cover more ground and convert more people, but the merchants had other priorities in mind: the carrack had to land at a harbour that protected their valuable cargo from the wind and weather, and a stable port of call was essential to build a reliable clientele. The daimy≈ç of Hirado, Matsura Takanobu, was initially accommodative to the missionaries due to their association with the Portuguese traders, but turned hostile once he felt they overdid their evangelization by burning books and destroying Buddhist images. Matsura Takanobu evicted the missionaries from Hirado in 1558, and did not allow them to come back for five years. In 1561, 15 Portuguese were killed in Hirado in a brawl with the Japanese while a captain was also killed in Akune marking the first recorded clashes between Europeans and the Japanese. Faced with such events, the Portuguese found it prudent to find a safer port to call. Yokoseura (in present-day Saikai, Nagasaki) was found to be a suitable harbour, and the local daimyo, ≈åmura Sumitada, was so receptive to the teachings of Christianity that he converted in 1563, making him the first Christian daimyo. The Portuguese landed at Yokoseura in 1562 and 1563. In November 1563, ≈åmura vassals who were incensed at his conversion to Christianity rebelled and Yokoseura was burned down during the chaos. The Portuguese returned to Hirado the next year despite Jesuit warnings. There, Matsura Takanobu allegedly started a fire that burned a substantial part of the Portuguese goods. It was clear that the Portuguese could not safely conduct their trade in Hirado. Battle In 1565, the Captain-major Jo√£o Pereira brought the carrack to the port of Yokoseura with the intention of going to trade in Hirado. He was dissuaded from doing so by the Jesuits in Yokoseura, and was persuaded to head to another ≈åmura anchorage at the bay of Fukuda, within present-day Nagasaki, accompanied by a small galleon belonging to Diogo de Meneses, the captain of Malacca. Deprived of his potential pickings, Matsura Takanobu sought to punish the Portuguese for switching ports and conspired with Sakai merchants who came all the way to Hirado for naught. Matsura promised to divide the booty with the Sakai merchants in return for the loan of eight to ten of their large junks, and attached up to sixty smaller Japanese boats to form a flotilla carrying several hundred samurai to sail to Fukuda. The Jesuit fathers in Hirado sent warnings to Pereira when they realized what Takanobu was doing, but Pereira dismissed the threat. He was hence surprised when he saw the Hirado flotilla approach from the horizon. The flotilla attacked the carrack in the morning of 18 October, when most of the crew was on the shore and could not return to the ship in time. This left only about 80 Europeans on the flagship, along with an uncounted number of black slaves and Chinese merchants taking refuge on board. The Japanese boats focused on boarding the larger carrack, and at one point climbed aboard from the stern and shot a musket at Pereira, denting his helmet. The Japanese then made their way into the great cabin, briefly holding the captain-major hostage and carrying off his writing desk before being repelled. The flotilla's focus on the carrack left it exposed to the Portuguese galleon, which was able to support the carrack by catching the Japanese flotilla in the two ships' crossfire. The cannons wrought such havoc on the frail Japanese boats that the Hirado forces, after losing 3 ships and over 70 men, in addition to over 200 wounded, withdrew to their base crestfallen. The battle lasted two hours. The victorious carrack, suffering only 8 lives lost, set sail for Macao at the end of November. Aftermath The Jesuits in Hirado wrote jubilantly of the Portuguese victory, which increased the prestige of the Portuguese in the eyes of the Japanese, \\"for the Japanese had hitherto only known us as merchants, and rated us no better than the Chinese\\". The Japanese also came to respect the superiority of Western gunpowder weapons. The Portuguese continued to call at Fukuda and the nearby Kuchinotsu for a few more years, but they felt the terrains of these ports were lacking and kept searching until ≈åmura Sumitada offered the Jesuits the nearby port of Nagasaki, a mere fishing village at the time that the Portuguese found to be perfect. From 1571 onward the Portuguese traders focused their activities on Nagasaki, turning it into the hub of Japan's foreign trade and its window to the West until the 19th century.

He was an officer in The Sherwood Foresters during the First World War and was killed in action in only his second time in the trenches, after he fell down a shaft which had been used to explode a mine under the German lines. His book on Chartism, which he had begun before the war, was completed and published posthumously in 1918. It was one of the first scholarly works on the subject and one of the first to have been written by someone who was not a first-hand witness to events. Early life Mark Hovell was born in Manchester on 21 March 1888, the son of William and Hannah Hovell, of Brooklands, Cheshire, apparently in humble circumstances. He won a scholarship to the Manchester Grammar School at the age of ten. Circumstances forced him to leave school to work at age 12 but he returned in August 1901 as a pupil-teacher at Moston Lane Municipal School. Overcoming serious illness, he won the Hulme Scholarship to the Victoria University of Manchester in June 1906 and enrolled as a history undergraduate that October. He graduated with a first class degree in 1909. In 1910, he took the Teachers' Diploma.\\"Introduction Mark Hovell (1888‚Äì1916)\\" by T.F. Tout in Mark Hovell & T.F. Tout (Ed.) (1918) The Chartist movement. Manchester: University Press. pp. xxi‚Äìxxxvii. Career In 1910, Hovell was appointed assistant lecturer in history at Victoria University of Manchester with special responsibility for the Workers Educational Association (WEA) activities of the university. He took classes in Colne, Ashton and Leigh and won the confidence of his students by walking the moors on a Sunday with them. In the winter of 1913‚Äì14 he taught for the WEA in London and impressed his students with his sincere interest in the lot of the common man in the early nineteenth century. Hovell could have become a Medievalist but his interest in the Napoleonic campaigns, which he studied under Spenser Wilkinson, and his work for the WEA, led instead to specialisms in military history and the social and economic history of the early Victorian age respectively. The latter hardened into a detailed examination of the Chartist Movement. His election to the Langton Fellowship in 1911 provided a small income for three years that allowed him to concentrate on that topic rather than teaching, but throughout this time he continued to struggle to repay the money advanced to him by the Board of Education to fund his earlier studies. In 1912‚Äì13, Hovell spent a year studying and teaching at Karl Lamprecht's institute in Leipzig. Hovell was probably sympathetic to Lamprecht's theory of Kulturgeschichte (\\"History of Culture\\") but found his historical ideas idiosyncratic and the students he was asked to teach, uninspired. He enjoyed the social life, however, and witnessed a student duel. He wrote to Thomas Tout that he was generally impressed by the German way of life, but shocked by the hostility to England that he encountered at every turn, despite receiving warm hospitality personally. Hovell returned to England by August 1913 and continued his researches into Chartism and taught WEA courses. He was appointed as lecturer in military history at the Victoria University, which had introduced the course to prepare its students for commissions in the British Army. First World War Destruction at Vermelles, December 1914. Following the outbreak of the First World War, the university's course in military history was downgraded when, as Tout described it, the students swapped theory for practice. Hovell followed in 1915 despite his book nearing completion. He wrote to Tout that \\"the Chartists are dead and gone, while the Germans are very much alive.\\" Hovell received basic training at Hornsea and was gazetted to a \\"Kitchener\\" battalion of The Sherwood Foresters in August 1915, joining the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment as a second lieutenant. There being more junior officers than platoons to command, he was shuffled around to various establishments where he learned drill, spent time at Camberley Staff College and learned musketry at York where he witnessed a Zeppelin raid. Hovell's training and waiting around lasted almost a year during which time he married Fanny Gatley of Sale on 3 June 1916. After the start of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916, Hovell heard rumours that \\"officers were being exported by the hundred\\", presumably to replace casualties, and in early July he was sent to France. Before he went, he made Tout promise to ensure his history of Chartism was published if anything happened to him. He joined a battalion of his regiment in an unnamed small mining village, probably Vermelles in Pas de Calais. The unit had experienced great losses in the fighting on the Somme but he did his best to reconstitute it, becoming an expert in physical training, Bayonet fighting, and map-reading before the unit was sent back to the trenches. On 1 August 1916 he wrote to Tout that: Death Vermelles British Cemetery Hovell died in the evening of 12 August 1916 after going to the aid of a soldier who had been overcome by fumes from a shaft which had been used to explode a mine under the German trenches. Hovell's comrades believed that he too was overcome, causing him to fall into the shaft to his death. He was buried nearby at Vermelles; the service conducted by the regimental chaplain the Rev. T. Eaton McCormick, who coincidentally was also the vicar of Hovell's parish in England. McCormick wrote to Hovell's mother that just as he spoke the words \\"earth to earth\\", \\"all the surrounding batteries of our artillery burst forth into a tremendous roar in a fresh attack upon the German line ... He has, as the soldiers say, \\"gone West\\" in a blaze of glory.\\"Tout, pp. xxxv‚Äìxxxvi. He is remembered at Vermelles British Cemetery at grave number 1112.HOVELL, MARK. Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Retrieved 29 November 2015. His daughter, Marjorie, was born on 26 March 1917. Legacy After Hovell's death, the incomplete \\"rough draft\\" of his book on Chartism was placed in the hands of Thomas Tout by Fanny Hovell. The first part was substantially complete, however, the later sections were less finished and Hovell's manuscript stopped in 1842. Tout sought opinions at the university and sent the manuscript to Julius West whose own A history of the Chartist Movement was in preparation and who discovered that his conclusions were broadly the same as those of Hovell. In an odd coincidence, West also died prematurely, of a complication of influenza and pneumonia in 1918, and his book also had to be completed by another author, in his case J.C. Squire, before being published in 1920. Tout wrote a preface, an introduction which consists of a biographical sketch of Hovell, and the concluding chapter which took the story from the failure of the charter in 1842 to the last days of Chartism in the 1850s. The book was published by the Victoria University in 1918.\\"Preface\\" by T.F. Tout in Mark Hovell & T.F. Tout (Ed.) (1918) The Chartist movement. Manchester: University Press. pp. v‚Äìviii.

Chad suggests that Hester wasn't actually dead and that she got up and walked away after the Chanels put her there. Chad takes Chanel to spend Thanksgiving with his family. Each of his family members share one thing they're grateful for. As Chanel becomes more and more irritated by Mrs. Radwell's (Julia Duffy) arrogant remarks about her, Hester arrives unexpectedly. Chad, ashamed of his tumultuous relationship with her, tells his family that Hester is his \\"sober coach,\\" claiming that he has a drinking problem. A fight quickly ensues. As a result, Mr. Radwell (Alan Thicke) offers Chanel a check for $50,000 if she leaves their house and never comes back. The Radwells begin to play pictionary as they continue to insult Chanel and Hester. Finally Chanel gets fed up and rants. She apologizes for trying to kill Hester and then proceeds to tell off each of the Radwells, ending with Chad, and telling him she never wants to talk to him again. She then storms away, accompanied by Hester, the two girls having made amends. Gigi (Nasim Pedrad) spent Thanksgiving with Red Devil in their hotel room. Gigi complains about not being able to spend the holiday with her boyfriend, Wes (Oliver Hudson). But regardless, she thanks the devil for keeping her company. Moments later, room service brings them a meal. Gigi is about to cut it before she thanks the Devil for being the closest she has to family. She then decides the Red Devil should \\"do the honors,\\" by cutting the bird and hands them the knife. The Red Devils turns on the knife and gives a devious look towards Gigi. Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd) goes to spend Thanksgiving with her adopted family, but is so disgusted by how arrogant and insane they are. She ends up leaving and going back to campus, not before saying she's starting a new family tradition; not to attend any family occasion ever. There, she finds Dean Cathy Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) preparing a turkey. As Cathy has Thanksgiving dinner with Grace (Skyler Samuels), Zayday (Keke Palmer), Pete (Diego Boneta), Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin), Chanel #3, and Wes, they begin to argue over who they think the killer is. Cathy thinks it's Chanel #3, while Chanel #3 thinks it's Cathy. Wes starts to think it's Grace, but Grace provides evidence as to why she couldn't be, but why she suspects it's Chanel. She also says she thinks Chanel was the one who put hydrochloric acid in Melanie Dorkus's tanning spray. Meanwhile, Pete tells a story based on the evidence he dug up, claiming Wes is the killer. Pete reveals that, by bribing a government official with drugs, he discovered that Wes was Boone's (Nick Jonas) father, and thus, the father of the other bathtub baby. Wes talks to Grace alone and tells her that he didn't know he had knocked up Sophia. After the two make up, Zayday calls them over for dinner. Chanel and Hester arrive, as does Chad soon after. He and Chanel make up as well, and Chanel #3 and Chanel #5 go retrieve the turkey. As Chanel uncovers the Turkey, everyone begins screaming in horror. It is revealed that instead of holding the turkey, the platter is holding Gigi's head.

It is constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture. The legend of the temple is associated with Narasimha, an avatar of Hindu god Vishnu appearing for Hanuman and Lakshmi. The image of Anjaneyar is tall, making it one of the tallest images of Hanuman in India. The Agamam is followed by \\"Sri Vaikhanasam\\". The temple has a pillared hall leading to the sanctum. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which fifteen-day Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April) when the image of presiding deities are taken around the streets of the temple, being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Narasimha slaying Hiranyakasipu as Prahlada prays Hiranyakasipu was troubling the Devas as he got a boon from Brahma that no human can kill him, neither could he be killed in morning, noon or night nor in air, water or ground. His son Prahlada was an ardent devotee of Vishnu against the wishes of his father. He also tried to slay Prahalada at various times, just to be saved by the divine grace of Vishnu. During a heated argument with Prahalada, Hiranyakasipu was asking if Vishnu is present everywhere and went on to break a pillar with his weapon. Vishnu took the avatar of Narasimha and appeared from the pillar. Narasimha was a human with lion face and slayed Hiranyakasipu on an evening time in a doorway, which was neither land nor air. Ages past by, when Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu was doing penance at this place. Hanuman (locally called Anjaneyar) was carrying an image made of Saligrama and Lakshmi requested him to get her a view of Vishnu in the form of Narasimha. Hanuman entrusted the saligrama to her and asked her to hold it until he returns. Lakshmi placed the image at this place, which grew into a mount before Hanuman could return. Narasimha appeared before both of them and set his abode at this place. The Narasimhaswamy temple, located right at the foot hills is also associated with this legend and Hanuman is believed to have worshipped him in standing posture form a distance axial to the temple. Architecture The temple is located in Namakkal, in the downhill of the Namakkal hill in Namakkal district in Tamil Nadu on the road from Namakkal to Salem. The temple has a flat gateway tower with a pillared hall leading to the santum. The sanctum houses the image of Anjaneyar axially facing the Narasimha shrine in the foothills, located away. The image of Anjaneyar is carved out of a single stone and believed to be existing from the 5th century. There is no roof over the sanctum and Anjaneyar has a unique iconography sporting a sword in his waist and holding a garland made of saligrama. The temple is considered one of the prominent temples in the Tamil Nadu state and the country. Festival and religious practises The Narasimhaswamy temple in the fort facing the Anjaneyar temple The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasandhi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikala poojai at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Arthajama Pooja at 8:45 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for the presiding deities. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6:30 a.m. ‚Äì 1:00 p.m. and 4:30 - 9:00 p.m. on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings.

She was the first director of Clarke School for the Deaf, the first U.S. institution to teach the deaf by articulation and lip reading rather than by signing. Her success in teaching deaf children to speak helped change American public opinion, which was traditionally inclined toward sign language, opening the door for the auditory/oral method to be used in many American schools. The controversy over which form of communication is preferable has continued since there are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. Rogers, having tried to use both methods, realized that it was confusing to deaf children to be taught both methods simultaneously. Subsequently, she advocated for the use of the auditory/oral method, with significant success. While sign language has advantages, and a deaf culture has emerged based on the use of this fully functioning language, For many, the ability to speak and lipread, and thus communicate with the hearing world, is an essential aspect of the education of the deaf. Rogers can therefore be recognized for her significant contribution. Biography Early years Harriet Burbank Rogers was born on April 12, 1834, in North Billerica, Massachusetts, one of five daughters of Calvin Rogers. She graduated from Massachusetts State Normal School (now Framingham State College) in 1851, after which she taught at several schools in Massachusetts. She became interested in teaching children with special needs, probably through the experience of her sister, who worked as a teacher of deaf-blind children. Teaching the deaf Rogers became interested in the European method of teaching the deaf, which emphasized teaching of articulation through imitation of breathing patterns and larynx vibrations, rather than sign language. This method was considered far better in restoring the deaf to society and giving them a fuller knowledge of language, but was mostly rejected in the United States in favor of sign language. Rogers read German authors and received most of her knowledge through books. Although she had no formal education to teach deaf children, in 1863, she was hired as a private tutor by the Cushing family to train their deaf daughter, Fanny. Rogers initially used both oral and sign methods, instructing Fanny to speak and to use her fingers to spell words. However, Rogers soon became aware that it was unwise to use both methods, so she turned completely toward the oral method. As Fanny gradually learned to speak, Rogers and her method became famous throughout the state. Her success in teaching Fanny attracted the attention of Gardiner Hubbard, the Massachusetts businessman whose daughter Mabel was also deaf (she would later marry Alexander Graham Bell). Hubbard substantially supported Rogers, helping her to set up a school for the deaf in 1866, in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. The school initially had five students. Auditory/oral vs. sign language Rogers initially met strong resistance in using her oral method of education, as the educators of the deaf in the United States were traditionally inclined toward sign language. The controversy between auditory/oral and sign language educational method is an old controversy in deaf education. In the United States, ever since Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817, the sign language method dominated deaf education. On the other hand, in Europe the auditory/oral method was the preferred method of education of the deaf. Both approaches have certain pros and cons. The oral method stresses the importance of speech and oral language development. It emphasizes lips- and contextual-visual-clues-reading from the face and body. It also teaches to speak rather than to sign. The benefit of this method is that it provides the deaf individual with necessary spoken language skills to function independently in society. Individuals who rely on sign language always feel segregated among people that do not understand sign language. The auditory/oral method also facilitates development of reading and writing skills. The drawback of this method, however is that it requires lot of time and effort from teachers to teach an individual even the basic words. Sometimes the results are quite limited, with an individual being able to speak only a dozen or more words. On the other side, sign language is a fully developed and autonomous language which individuals can learn with relative ease. It can be used to express a whole range of things which are impossible for individuals who can utilize only a limited amount of words. The drawback, however, is that deaf individuals sometimes totally depend on signing, and can barely communicate with people who do not know sign language. Clarke School for the Deaf In 1867, John Clarke, a wealthy merchant who lost his hearing in his later years, opened a school for the deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts. He invited Rogers to serve as its first director. The school was the first U.S. institution to teach the deaf by articulation and lip reading rather than by signing. It was also the first school that emphasized the need to start teaching children at an early age. Rogers served as the director at the Clarke School from 1867 to 1886. She worked at the school with Alexander Graham Bell, who implemented his father's Visible Speech System to teach instructors in the oral method of teaching. Later years Poor health forced Rogers to leave the directorship of the Clarke School in 1886, and was succeeded by Caroline A. Yale. She returned to her home in North Billerica, Massachusetts, where she opened a kindergarten. Harriet Burbank Rogers died on December 12, 1919, in North Billerica, Massachusetts. Legacy The oral method of instruction was initially opposed by many in the United States, where sign language was preferred as the primary mode of communication for the deaf. However, Rogers' success in teaching deaf children to speak swayed public opinion on this matter in another direction, opening the door for the method of auditory/oral instruction in many American schools.

It was first established as a mission station by the Jesuits in 1596 under the advocacy of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. The church was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines.  History  Capul was first established as a mission station by the Jesuits in 1596.According to Javellana, the Jesuits may have reached the island in 1610. The date 1596 comes from the marker of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. The first church made of nipa and hardwood was dedicated to Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Moro attacks from the Pacific Ocean destroyed the church. A new church made of stone, along with a fortress, was built to protect the town from Moro invasion in the 1600s. Father Juan Isandi,Also spelled as Esandi. last Jesuit priest to Capul, died during the Moro attacks in 1768. After the Jesuits were expelled in the country, the Franciscans later supervised Capul in 1768 with Father Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez as the first Franciscan priest there. The church was again destroyed by the Moro and Father Mariano Valera supervised the reconstruction of the third church and construction of the high bell tower in 1781. On 8 November 1864, Capul was elevated as a parish by the Bishop of Cebu.The marker of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines states that Capul was elevated as a parish on 8 November 1864. Javellana states that Capul was elevated as a parish on 18 November 1869 in conformity of an episcopal decree dated 12 September 1864 Architecture The church is an example of a Spanish fortress church. It is surrounded by strong stone walls and bastions of dissimilar designs. Father Valero designed the church with a cross-shaped wall made of stone, similar to Intramuros. When Moro attacked the town, the people of Capul would take refuge inside the church. The bell tower is located on the left side of the church. A stone watchtower on a huge rock is located near the church complex. A small chapel, probably a mortuary chapel, can also be found inside the complex. Its facade is simple as it forms a defensive wall. Pilasters and a split pediment around the central door only adorn the facade. A typhoon destroyed the church's neo- gothic altar in 1947 and in 1987, another typhoon caused extensive damage when it ripped off the roof and ceiling. The church was afterwards repaired but is virtually an empty shell. The storm also destroyed the church's convent.  Historical and cultural declarations  A historical marker was installed to Capul Church on 5 August 2011. It was also declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines in 2014.

He has been called \\"one of the leading academic experts on American incarceration.\\" Early life and education Western was born in Australia, to a white native Australian father who taught at the University of Queensland, and a Thai international student mother. His father was John Western. He became interested in inequality in Australia growing up in Queensland, where he, his brother, and their mother stood out as racial minorities. He received his B.A. in government with honors from the University of Queensland in 1987. That year, Western then became a student in the doctoral program in sociology at the Graduate Center, CUNY, with the intention of both working with sociologist Iv√°n Szel√©nyi and fulfilling a long-held dream of living in New York City. Szelenyi left the Graduate Center in 1988, and Western followed him to the University of California, Los Angeles, where he subsequently received his masters' and Ph.D. degrees in sociology from in 1990 and 1993, respectively. Career After receiving his PhD, Western taught at Princeton University for fourteen years. He taught at Harvard University from 2007 to 2018, where he was a professor of sociology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the director of the Kennedy School's Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy. and the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Professor of Criminal Justice Policy, as well as director of the Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy and faculty chair of the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. In 2018 he moved to Columbia University, where he is professor of sociology and co-director of the Justice Lab. Research Prisons and mass incarceration Originally, Western's research pertained to organized labor, but he became interested in researching prisons and mass incarceration, in his words, \\"almost by accident\\" after talking to a colleague about the United States' use of prisons to manage disadvantaged populations. As of 2008, he had written or co-written more than a dozen articles about prisons, as well as a book (\\"Punishment and Inequality in America\\") on the same topic. In \\"Punishment and Inequality in America\\", originally published in 2006, he concludes that \\"mass imprisonment has erased many of the \\"gains to African American citizenship hard won by the civil rights movement.\\"\\" In a 2010 study, Western and fellow sociologist Becky Pettit outlined the way in which, according to them, poverty increases prison populations and these populations in turn increase poverty. Other studies co- authored by Pettit and Western have found that on average, incarceration reduces annual salaries by about 40% for the average male former prisoner, and reduces hourly wages by,on average, 11% and annual employment by nine weeks. In 2009, with Devah Pager and Naomi Sugie, he found African American job applicants with a criminal record were less likely to receive a call back after an interview than white applicants with a criminal record. As of 2013, Western was also studying what happens to prisoners after they are released, and has interviewed the subjects of the study in person, which has, according to Elizabeth Gudrais, \\"put a human face on the statistics and dashed preconceived notions in the process.\\" In 2015, he published a study based on these interviews, showing that 40% of the recently incarcerated prisoners he interviewed in the Boston area had witnessed a killing when they were children. Another finding of his research on these released prisoners was that most of them immediately return to poverty upon their release. Unions He has also researched the relationship between the decline of unions and increasing income inequality, and has found that the former accounted for a third of the increase in income inequality among male workers. Honors and awards In 2005, while on the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, Western received a Guggenheim Fellowship for his project, \\"The Growth and Consequences of American Inequality.\\" His book \\"Punishment and Inequality in America\\" won both the 2008 Michael J. Hindelang Book Award from the American Society of Criminology and the 2007 Albert J. Reiss, Jr. Distinguished Scholarship Award from the American Sociological Association. Western was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences in 2015. Personal life As of 2008, Western lived in Brookline, Massachusetts with his wife and three daughters.

Construction Plans for the new vessel Regulator was built by Louis Paquet (1845-1920), an experienced shipbuilder of Portland, Oregon.Also seen spelled \\"Pacquet\\". The boat was contracted for by the Dalles, Portland and Astoria Navigation Company, popularly known as the Regulator Line, or by its abbreviation, DP&AN.; This company had been organized to provide steamboat service from The Dalles to the lower Columbia river, by a combination of steamboats and a newly built, state-funded portage railway around the main obstruction on the route, the Cascades Rapids. The first annual meeting of DP&AN; subscribers was held on Saturday, April 4, 1891, at 2:00 p.m. at the Board of Trade, in The Dalles, Oregon. DP&AN; had appointed a committee to examine the costs and other details of constructing a steamboat to run on the Columbia River between The Dalles and Cascade Locks, to make a connection with the portage railway around Cascades Rapids. In mid-March, 1891, the DP&AN; committee returned to The Dalles, having made arrangements with four shipbuilders to submit, to the company‚Äôs first annual meeting, to be held on April 4, sealed bids for a steamboat that would be 160 feet long, 30 foot beam, and 7 foot depth of hold, capable of a speed of 17 to 18 knots. The bids were to give estimates of everything connected with the vessel except the furniture. At the April 4 annual meeting, the committee reported that they had awarded the contract to build the vessel to Paquet & Smith, for the price of $25,000, with directions to construct a sternwheeler at any point between Cascades Locks and The Dalles, to be finished by August 1, 1891. The boat was required to be capable of speed of 15 miles per hour. Hugh Glenn was appointed to be superintendent of the construction of the vessel.Smith was apparently B.F. Smith. Construction at The Dalles Ladies cabin on the steamer Regulator The new steamer, named Regulator, was built in The Dalles, Oregon, on bank of the Columbia River at the foot of Washington Street. On Thursday, June 25, 1891, the still incomplete Regulator was launched. The ceremony began at 11:00 a.m. with an optimistic speech by B.S. Huntington. At exactly 3:00 p.m., Miss Bessie French broke a bottle of wine over the bow of the steamer, christening the vessel. Workman then knocked out the props under the hull, and the boat slid into the water. The boat was driven by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of , producing 300 to 350 total indicated HP. In mid-July, 1891, the hull was complete, the lower works were nearly done, and the upper cabin (called a \\"saloon\\" was shortly to be enclosed. The engines were expected to arrive on the 17th or 18 July. All wood work on the vessel was expected to be complete on about August 1. The boiler was built by the Willamette Iron and Steel Works, in Portland. By August 4, 1891 the boiler had been installed, and painting was expected to begin within a few days.  Dimensions and appearance  Regular‚Äôs hull was 152 feet long, exclusive of the extension over the stern, called a fantail, on which the sternwheel was mounted. The beam was 28 feet and depth of hold was 6.5 feet. Regulator‚Äôs size was 434.18 gross and 334.88 net tons. The official merchant vessels registry number was 110935. Regulator had a cargo-carrying capacity of 240 tons. The maximum speed was 17 miles per hour. The pilot house was originally decorated with a pair of antlers donated by a merchant of The Dalles. Operations Regulator was intended to compete with, or \\"regulate\\" as was then the term, the perceived monopoly on riverine and railroad transport held in region of The Dalles by the Union Pacific Railway. When Regulator was still under construction, a local newspaper strongly endorsed patronage of the Regulator and recommended boycotts of any merchant who might continue to use the Union Pacific. Trial trip The trial trip of the Regulator was run on September 10, 1891, with the boat departing from The Dalles at 9:34 a.m., proceeding downstream towards the Cascades, which it reached at 12:04, with landings en route at White Salmon, Stanley Point, Hood River, and Chenowith. The steamer travelled 18.5 miles in the first hour of the trip, while going into a 20-mile per hour head wind. A newspaper reporter opined that \\"it is perfectly safe to say she is god for 20 miles down stream anytime.\\" Regulator covered the 45-mile distance between The Dalles and Cascade Locks in 2 hours and 26 minutes. Along the way people at residences and settlements came out to wave handkerchiefs as a salute to the steamer. On board were sixty invited guests, mostly stockholders of the company and their wives, as well as the builder, Louis Pacquet, of Portland, Oregon. The company could not find enough waiters to hire for the occasion, so the first passengers were informed to bring a picnic basket dinner, and the company would provide coffee and tea free of charge. Regulator departed the Cascades at 1:24 p.m. and arrived back at The Dalles at the dock at the foot of Court Street at 4:50 p.m. On the morning of the next day, September 11, 1891, the directs of The Dalles, Portland & Astoria Navigation Company held a meeting at the office of contractor Hugh Glenn, and formally accepted the vessel from the builders, Pacquet & Smith. Early competition with Union Pacific Early advertisement for Regulator, placed September 19, 1891. As of September 19, 1891, Regulator was running for the Dalles, Portland, and Astoria Navigation Company on a route from the foot of Court Street at The Dalles for Cascade Locks, Oregon every morning at 7:00 a.m., and stopping at way points en route. S.L. Brooks was the steamer‚Äôs agent in The Dalles. Frederick H. \\"Fred\\" Sherman (1857-1954) was the first captain of the Regulator. The principal competitor of the Dalles, Portland and Astoria line was the Union Pacific Railroad, which, in addition to its rail line along the river, owned and operated steamboats on the Columbia River. On October 21, 1891, Regulator was charging $1 per person for passenger fares from The Dalles to Portland. Union Pacific was charging $3.85 for passage on its steamers and trains up until then, but then dropped its rates precipitously to 50 cents, on the steamers only There were no cuts in the freight rates Union Pacific also owned the portage railway around the Cascades Rapids, but the rates the railway could charge on the portage railway were sharply restricted by law. The D.P.&A.N.;, owners of the Regulator, were not expected to meet the reduced rates of the Union Pacific, due to having the pledges of numerous merchants of The Dalles to place their patronage with Regulator, no matter how low the UP rates might go. Wrecked at Cascades Steamer Regulator wrecked at the Cascades Rapids, July 12, 1898. At about noon on July 12, 1898, Regulator was wrecked just downstream from the locks at the Cascades Rapids. The wreck occurred when the Sarah Dixon at reached the locks, and was waiting for Regulator to enter, as the two vessels usually locked together. Regulator attempted to enter the lower lock, but could not do so because of the high winds. Regulator backed down river to make another try, but in doing so, the boat was caught by a gust of wind and blown into the rapids on the south side of the river. The boat hit a rock, which punch a hole in the hull. Eventually the steamer was sunk up to the level of the stateroom windows. On board at the time were 160 passengers and a large amount of freight, including some teams of horses. The passengers and some of the freight were landed on the Oregon shore. Salvage of Regulator required removal of its machinery, which had begun by July 19, 1898. Regulator was still stranded on August 6, 1898. Reportedly the company had secured 50 empty oil drums, with the plan of shoving them into the sunken hull, displacing the water inside, and floating the steamer so it could be taken downriver to Portland for repair. However, work was still being done on the boat at the locks on September 1, when the DP&AN;‚Äôs general agent, W.C. Allaway, went to the site to superintend the work. On September 2, 1898, the Sarah Dixon was able to tow Regulator into the Cascade Locks, where, on the next day, the boat was laying as if in a drydock. Temporary boat ways had been built under the steam as it lay alongside the shore. However, when launching the vessel, a piece of one of the temporary ship ways broke loose and punctured the hull, so that it flooded again once it entered the water, leaving the boat laying over on its side. Refloating it again was thought to take another 150 barrels. It was thought that the hull might have to be replaced but the cabin structure was still in good condition and could be reused. The plan in early September was to place 200 empty oil drums into the hold, and thereby float the vessel either to The Dalles or Portland for more through repair. Reconstruction Eventually Regulator was returned to The Dalles, where it was rebuilt with a larger and heavier hull. Originally the hull had been 152 feet long, and the gross tonnage was 434. After reconstruction, the hull was 157 feet long, and the gross tonnage was 508. By February 1899 the reconstructed boat was ready for inspection by U.S. government steamboat inspectors from Portland. On the evening of Saturday, February 18, 1899, under 90 pounds steam pressure in the boiler, Regulator was taken on a trial run from The Dalles to Lyle, Oregon. The trial was satisfactory, and the steamer was ready to be placed into service as soon as painting and some minor improvements could be completed. As of March 3, 1899, Regulator was returned to regular service on runs between The Dalles and Portland. Rescue of Dalles City On January 10, 1905, the stern-wheel steamer Dalles City struck a rock near Stevenson, Washington. With a large hole in the hull, Dalles City was beached. Regulator took off 70 passengers from Dalles City and carried them on to their destination. Destruction by fire Regulator after explosion and fire, January 25, 1906. On January 24, 1906, Regulator was on the ways of the St. Johns Shipbuilding Company, in St. Johns, Oregon, having been hauled out about two weeks before for annual maintenance work in preparation for going on the steamer‚Äôs usual summer run between Portland and The Dalles, Oregon. At 1:20 p.m. there was an explosion, followed by a fire, which killed two crewman, injured a number more, and destroyed the vessel. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but appeared to originate with an oil tank on which the two men who were killed, engineer De Monte W. Wade and fireman Merrill B. Stayton, were working. Wade and Stayton were in the process of connecting the right and left oil tanks, in preparation for which they had drilled holes in both tanks. Suddenly a huge explosion occurred in the forward part of the steamer, and the vessel took fire. Eighteen ship carpenters and labors were at work on the vessel at the time, as well as five dockhands under the supervision of Capt. E.C. Alden. Chief Engineer F.F. Smith was also on board. All had to leap from the vessel on to the mud flat below the repair ways, and run for safety. One carpenter, Daniel Reid, had been standing near the exploding oil tank, and he was splattered with burning oil. Severely burned about the head, Reid was taken to Good Samitarian Hospital, where his prospects for recovery were reported to have been good. Engineer Smith saved the life of a watchman, who had been asleep in a cabin on the upper deck, by breaking down the jammed door with a timber. The explosion was so severe that the charred body of fireman Stayton was blown through the hull. According to one witness, a carpenter who had been just about to board the vessel when the explosion occurred: There were about six barrels of fuel oil in the forward oil tanks, which held a total of about 78 gallons. The St. Johns fire company fought the fire until the city fireboat, the George H. Williams arrived, which, under Captain Whitcomb, took 28 minutes to proceed downriver to the fire scene from the time it received the alarm. Wade was 27 years old and the sole support of his widowed mother. He was a member of the fraternal benefit society Woodmen of the World. Stayton had come from a family of steamboat men. His father built the sternwheeler Nestor and his brother was a steamboat captain. Salvage of components The engine and machinery from Regulator were installed in a new steamer, the Weown, launched in 1907.

This fort was part of a wider program of fortifications called \\"Moselstellung\\" encompassing fortresses scattered between Thionville and Metz in the Moselle valley. The aim of Germany was to protect against a French campaign to take back Alsace-Lorraine from the German Empire.  Overall design  The fortification system was designed to accommodate the growing advances in artillery since the end of the 19th century. Based on new defensive concepts, such as dispersal and concealment, the fortified group was to be, in case of attack, an impassable barrier for French forces. From 1899, the Schlieffen plan of the German General Staff designed the fortifications of the Moselstellung, between Metz and Thionville to be like a lock for blocking any advance of French troops in case of conflict.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944. This concept of a fortified line on the Moselle was a significant innovation compared to the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system developed by the French. It later inspired the engineers of the Maginot Line.  Construction and facilities  Built between 1908 and 1914 in the northeast of Metz in Moselle, the infantry works occupy a plot of 47 ha. It is located in the communes of Coincy, Nouilly and Vantoux near the intersection of the Saarbr√ºcken and Saarlouis roads. The fort is named after the hamlet of Lauvalli√®res, located two kilometers to the east in Nouilly. A cross carved on the building reads \\"Belle-Croix 1908-1912\\". The fort could hold two hundred men and had : * three infantry observatories with armored fixed turrets and thirteen gatehouse observatories; * a telephone to central command; * central heating; * two hundred meters of underground galleries; * four 22-horsepower diesel engines driving four dynamos (14.5 kW).Les forts en Moselle ‚Äî Fort Lauvalli√®re  Successive assignments  From 1890 the garrison relief is guaranteed by the fort troops Corps XVI stationed at Metz and Thionville.

The management of this museum is the responsibility of the Federal State Institution of Culture \\"Ryazan Kremlin\\"  History   Ancient period  Human settlement on the territory of the Kremlin had occurred during the Mesolithic Era.. Archaeological excavations indicate large settlements in the territory of modern Fef—ëlovo Bora Kanishchevo, neighborhoods in Borki and Fisherman's streets. Slavic tribes had colonized these places already by the 6th-7th centuries. Closest to the fortress of the future settlement of Borkovskoye, people on the island of Oka led an active trade with the Byzantine Empire, East and West. The second major settlement was a fortified fort named Borisov-Glebov. Later, it became Pereyaslavlskoy residence of bishops, and then known as the area of Borisoglebskaya. Large clusters of settlements in the area, as well as the presence of a large commercial port has necessitated the construction of a fortified city to protect the population and the surrounding area. This city became Pereyaslavl-Ryazan.  Foundation of the city  The date that Kremlin Pereyaslavl-Ryazan was founded is listed in the Psalter, and today is stored in the Museum-Reserve In the 11th century Pereyaslavl-Ryazan Kremlin was a fortified castle, located in the highest, north-western part of the modern architectural complex on the site of the present church of the Holy Spirit today, an area of 2 hectares. Around the fortress were various suburbs, and numerous neukrepl—ënnye settlement in which the peasants, fisherman, and poor artisans lived. Streets were paved with wood, and yards were located close to each other. A princes' tower apparently stood on the site of the modern Dukhovskoy church. The area around the city was occupied by vast forests, two natural barriers, and Trubezh Lybed to navigate. On the hill there were two lakes, Fast and Karasev, where in the event of a siege people could take drinking water. At one point, the rivers flooded, turning the Kremlin into an island.

She finished strongly and took third place behind Greenland Park and Kilijaro. In the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July Devon Ditty started 15/8 favourite despite carrying top weight and racing over six furlongs for the first time. She was restrained by Starkey before producing a strong late run, taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by a length from Mixed Applause. Eleven days later she added a win in the Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot, easily beating Innini, Ring Lady and Strathspey at odds of 8/11. In the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse in August, Devon Ditty faced a rematch with Greenland Park who, since the Queen Mary Stakes, had gone on to win the Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood. Given an unfavourable draw, Starkey settled the filly before tracking across to the inside rail and launching his challenge approaching the final furlong. Devon Ditty took the lead and won by one and a half lengths from Eyelet, with Greenland Park in third place. Devon Ditty was dropped back in distance and matched against colts when she contested the Flying Childers Stakes (then a Group One race) over five furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in September. Greenland Park was again in opposition but her biggest rival appeared to be Abdu, a colt who started favourite after seven previous wins over sprint distances. Starting the 2/1 second choice in the betting, the filly took the lead from Abdu in the closing stages and fought off a challenge from Greenland Park to win by three quarters of a length. Devon Ditty ended her season at Newmarket in October when she started 11/8 favourite for the Cheveley Park Stakes, then the only Group One race in Britain restricted to juvenile fillies. The best of her six opponents appeared to be the Irish- trained Kilijaro, who, since finishing in front of Devon Ditty at Royal Ascot, had won the Phoenix Stakes by six lengths. After being restrained by Starkey as Penny Blessing set the pace from Do Be Daring, the favourite produced her customary late run and got the better of a sustained struggle with Kilijaro to win by a neck. Do Be Daring and Penny Blessing held on for third and fourth. 1979: three-year-old season On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Devon Ditty was moved up in distance for the seven furlong Nell Gwyn Stakes, a major trial for the 1000 Guineas. She proved no match for the Henry Cecil- trained One In A Million to whom she was attempting to concede seven pounds, and was beaten five lengths into second place. She was stepped up to a mile for the 1000 Guineas three weeks later and finished fifth of the seventeen runners behind One in a Million. After the race she was purchased for an undisclosed sum by Robert Sangster. On her first start for her new owner she was dropped back in distance for the Gus Demmy Stakes over six furlongs and recorded her only win of the season as she prevailed by a head from the colt Son of Shaka. For the remainder of the season, Devon Ditty was campaigned in sprint races and failed to win, although she ran well in defeat on several occasions. She was unplaced behind Double Form in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and then ran fourth behind Thatching, Vaigly Great and Greenland Park in the July Cup. At Goodwood she finished third to Ahonoora and Abdu in the King George Stakes, giving the impression that he found the five furlong trip inadequate. She was then sent to Germany for the Goldene Peitsche over 1200 metres at Baden-Baden and finished second to the locally trained Iron Ruler. On her final appearance in Europe she finished third to Double Form and Ahonoora in the Haydock Sprint Cup. 1980: four-year-old season For the 1980 season, Devon Ditty was transferred to California, where she was trained by John Gosden. On her American debut she finished sixth in an allowance race at Santa Anita Park in April and then won a similar event at Hollywood Park Racetrack on 1 May before finishing second to Country Queen in the Grade III Hawthorne Handicap at the same track three weeks later. In June the filly won an allowance at Hollywood and then recorded her biggest win in North America when winning the Brown Jade Stakes. In August she moved to Del Mar Racetrack where she finished third to A Thousand Stars in the Palomar Handicap and sixth behind Queen to Conquer in the Ramona Handicap. Assessment In the inaugural International Classification for European two-year-olds, Devon Ditty was rated on 85, making her the sixth-best juvenile of either sex and the joint second-best filly, behind the French-trained Sigy and level with the Fillies' Mile winner Formulate. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 122, the highest for any British-trained two-year-old filly. In the following year she was rated 119 by Timeform, twelve pounds below their top sprinter Thatching. The International Classification gave her a rating of 80, making her the fifth-best filly trained in Britain behind Connaught Bridge, One in a Million, Greenland Park and Topsy. Breeding record Devon Ditty was retired from racing to become a broodmare. All five of her known foals won races, although none of them were top-class performers: *Devon Diva, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1982, sired by The Minstrel. Won one race. Dam of Grade I winner Tinners Way *Ivybridge, chestnut colt, 1983, by Sir Ivor. Won two races. *Tom Cobbley, bay colt, 1986, by Seattle Slew. Won eight races. *Irish Ditty, chestnut colt (later gelded), 1987, by Irish River. Won two hurdle races. *Transcript, chestnut colt, 1989, by Secretariat. Won one race in Switzerland. Devon Ditty produced no foals after 1989 and was retired from breeding from 1993 until her death in 1999.

It branched off the Rangkasbitung-Labuan railway, going from Saketi in central Banten to Bayah on the southern Bantenese coast. The railway was constructed during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in World War II, primarily for transporting brown coal from the Bayah mines. History When the Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies (modern- day Indonesia) from 1942 to 1945, they wanted each of their occupied regions to be self-sufficient. Without importing coal, the locomotives on Java had to rely partially on wood as fuel, since the Javanese coal deposits were small and hard to reach. The wood was not enough however, so after finding government reports from 1900 about brown coal deposits in the south of Banten, the Japanese began constructing mines near Bayah and Mount Mandur (). Railway construction Since transporting brown coal by road would be unreliable in the tropical rain climate and limited due to truck capacity, construction on a railway to Bayah started in July 1942. The line from Saketi to Bayah was divided into about 10 sectors, each with a work force of approximately a thousand r≈çmusha (local forced labourers), a few engineers and technicians (mainly Dutch), headed by a Japanese supervisor. While the r≈çmusha working in the mines were imported from Central and East Java, the railway r≈çmusha were mainly locals from Banten. The construction took a total of 12 million person-days in 14 months. Working conditions were harsh due to food shortages, lack of medical care, and the tropical climate. Casualties are estimated to range from 20 to 60 thousand victims, not including mine workers. In remembrance of the perished labourers, a monument was built near Bayah's railway station after the war. It is reported to have been wide by tall and included a list of victims. Sabotage by resistance An Indo-European and Javanese resistance group, headed by a certain communist called Diponegoro from Purwokerto, sabotaged the railway line several times during its construction, including blowing up a bridge pillar in December 1943. After Diponegoro disappeared, the group was betrayed and in June 1944 the Kempeitai secret police arrested seven members. Six survived due to Japan surrendering earlier than the planned execution date. Exploitation The railway was finally opened on 1 April 1944. The line hauled at most 300 tons of brown coal and about 800 passengers each day. The whole project did little to alleviate the fuel problem in the end, since only 4000 tons of coal were mined per year instead of the targeted 300,000 tons, most likely due to estimation errors. Exploitation continued after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, although the Indonesian railway companies Angkatan Moeda Kereta Api (AMKA) and Djawatan Kereta Api Repoeblik Indonesia (DKARI) had difficulty maintaining it after the forced labourers left and civil unrest swept across the region. By 1948 a train journey from to was reported to take half a day. The rolling stock consisted primarily of regular SS stock, like the Mallet locomotive SS series 501‚Äì516. Final years Railway operations came to a standstill, when the Dutch regained power during Operation Kraai in December 1948. The region was deemed too dangerous to continue exploitation, even after the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. After the local Islamist insurgency had finally been put to rest, the Saketi‚ÄìBayah railway was used again in January 1951, but only to move out machinery and tools. The railway closed definitively in August. In November 1951, a commission deemed restoring the damaged line to be a waste of resources in the sparsely populated area. Unlike other closed lines on Java, the Saketi‚ÄìBayah railway was demolished soon afterwards and its remains were re-used elsewhere. By 1980, all Japanese buildings had gone and bridge foundations, a few railway tracks, and some raised platforms were all that remained.

Its highest point was at , while its lowest point was a stretch along the coast at . The single track passed 29 bridges, 9 railway stations and 5 smaller stops. Narrow gauge lines connected 20 mining shafts at 3 locations with the railway around Bayah and Mount Mandur. Stations Each station had at least two tracks, a small building and wooden lever frames for railway signalling, except Bayah and Gunung Mandur. The following is a list of the 9 stations and 5 smaller stops on this railway in order of position: Cimanggu *Kaduhauk *Jalupang *Pasung *Kerta *Gintung Cilangkahan *Sukahujan *Cihara *Panyawungan *: had 5 tracks and an iron lever frame constructed by the Alkmaarsche IJzer- en Metaalgieterij *Gunung Mandur: had no lever frame, being a railway terminus Reopening There are plans to reopen parts of the Saketi-Bayah and Rangkasbitung-Labuan railways for commercial transport, such as cement from the Merah Putih factory in Bayah.

History The Raqi Qirinxhi High School's history starts with the Lyceum of Kor√ßa. The Lyceum opened its doors on 25 October 1917 as the French Lyceum with the decision of the government of the Autonomous Region of Kor√ß√´. In 1921 it was renamed to National Lyceum. It was a secular school where all the subjects were in the French language with the exception of the Albanian language. During World War II, many students of the school joined the youth ranks of the Communist Party of Albania. Following this activity, the fascist regime closed the school. As a result of this decision, which many students found unjust, 150 of them joined the ranks of the Albanian liberation movement after a meeting in Voskopoje. Overall, 384 students of the school joined the liberation movement, out of which 54 died while fighting the fascist and Nazi enemies. Three of them have been declared People's Heroes of Albania by the Albanian government for extraordinary acts of bravery. After 1944, the re-opened school was named after former alumnus and teacher Raqi Qirinxhi, People's Teacher of Albania.

Description Concretely, partial likelihood estimation uses the product of conditional densities as the density of the joint conditional distribution. This generality facilitates maximum likelihood methods in panel data setting because fully specifying conditional distribution of yi can be computationally demanding.Wooldridge, J.M., Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. On the other hand, allowing for misspecification generally results in violation of information equality and thus requires robust standard error estimator for inference. In the following exposition, we follow the treatment in Wooldridge. Particularly, the asymptotic derivation is done under fixed-T, growing-N setting. Writing the conditional density of yit given xit as ft (yit xit;Œ∏), the partial maximum likelihood estimator solves: : \\\\max_{\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\sum_{t=1}^T \\\\log f_t(y_{it} \\\\mid x_{it}; \\\\theta) In this formulation, the joint conditional density of yi given xi is modeled as Œ†t ft (yit xit ; Œ∏). We assume that ft (yit |xit ; Œ∏) is correctly specified for each t = 1,...,T and that there exists Œ∏0 ‚àà Œò that uniquely maximizes E[ft (yit‚îÇxit ; Œ∏)]. But, it is not assumed that the joint conditional density is correctly specified. Under some regularity conditions, partial MLE is consistent and asymptotically normal. By the usual argument for M-estimators (details in Wooldridge ), the asymptotic variance of (Œ∏MLE\\\\- Œ∏0) is A‚àí1 BA‚àí1 where A‚àí1 = E[ ‚àët‚àá2Œ∏ logft (yit‚îÇxit ; Œ∏)]‚àí1 and B=E[( ‚àët‚àáŒ∏ logft (yit‚îÇxit ; Œ∏) ) ( ‚àët‚àáŒ∏ logft (yit‚îÇxit; Œ∏ ) )T]. If the joint conditional density of yi given xi is correctly specified, the above formula for asymptotic variance simplifies because information equality says B=A. Yet, except for special circumstances, the joint density modeled by partial MLE is not correct. Therefore, for valid inference, the above formula for asymptotic variance should be used. For information equality to hold, one sufficient condition is that scores of the densities for each time period are uncorrelated. In dynamically complete models, the condition holds and thus simplified asymptotic variance is valid.

For instance, in wage equation regressions, Fixed Effects capture ability measures that are constant over time, such as motivation. Chamberlain's approach to unobserved effects models is a way of estimating the linear unobserved effects, under Fixed Effect (rather than random effects) assumptions, in the following unobserved effects model :y_{it} = x_{it} b + c_i + u_{it} where ci is the unobserved effect and xit contains only time-varying explanatory variables.Wooldridge, J.

Specifically, this leads to the following equation :c_i = d + x_{i1} \\\\lambda_1 + x_{i2} \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\dots + x_{iT} \\\\lambda_T + e_i where the conditional distribution of ci given xit is unspecified, as is standard in Fixed Effects models. Combining these equations then gives rise to the following model.Chamberlain, G. (1982): Multivariate Regression Models for Panel Data. Journal of Econometrics (18), pp. 5-46Chamberlain, G. (1984): Panel Data. Handbook of Econometrics, Volume 2, ed. Z. Griliches and M. D. Intriligator.

Chamberlain uses minimum distance estimation, but a generalized method of moments approach would be another valid way of estimating this model. The latter approach also gives rise to a larger number of instruments than moment conditions, which leads to useful overidentifying restrictions that can be used to test the strict exogeneity restrictions imposed by many static Fixed Effects models.Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. Similar approaches have been proposed to model the unobserved effect. For instance, Mundlak follows a very similar approach, but rather projects the unobserved effect ci onto the average of all xit across all T time periods, more specifically Mundlak, Y. (1978): On the Pooling of Time Series and Cross Section Data. Econometrica (46), pp. 69-85 :c_i = d + \\\\overline{x}_i \\\\lambda + e_i It can be shown that the Chamberlain method is a generalization of Mundlak's model.

The approach thereby differs in important ways from other models that try to account for the same econometric problem. Instrumental variables, for example, attempt to model the endogenous variable X as an often invertible model with respect to a relevant and exogenous instrument Z. Panel analysis uses special data properties to difference out unobserved heterogeneity that is assumed to be fixed over time. Control functions were introduced by Heckman and Robb although the principle can be traced back to earlier papers. A particular reason why they are popular is because they work for non-invertible models (such as discrete choice models) and allow for heterogeneous effects, where effects at the individual level can differ from effects at the aggregate. A well-known example of the control function approach is the Heckman correction. Formal definition Assume we start from a standard endogenous variable setup with additive errors, where X is an endogenous variable, and Z is an exogenous variable that can serve as an instrument. A popular instrumental variable approach is to use a two-step procedure and estimate equation () first and then use the estimates of this first step to estimate equation () in a second step. The control function, however, uses that this model implies The function h(V) is effectively the control function that models the endogeneity and where this econometric approach lends its name from.Arellano, M.

It was proclaimed in 1968 and measures . Hardap is situated in Hardap Region, about south of Windhoek and about west of Mariental. It surrounds the Hardap Dam, Namibia's largest dam, which lies on the Fish River. There is a game park on the southern side of the dam.  History  The name Hardap is derived from the Nama word meaning 'nipple' or 'wart', in reference to the surrounding landscape of low conical shaped hills. Although first investigations to build a dam at Hardap were carried as early as 1897, construction started in 1960 and the dam was completed in 1963. It has a capacity of 320 million m3 and a surface area of 25 km2.  Geography and Access  The Resort is dominated by the Hardap Dam, the Fish and Groot Komatsas rivers. There are open savannah plains and nountanious areas include the Gemsbok Plateau.  Biology and Ecology   Flora  Hardap is in the Nama Karoo Biome and is characterised by Dwarf Shrubland. Common trees include the Shepherd's tree (Boscia albitrunca), camel thorn (Vachellia erioloba, formerly Acacia erioloba) green-hair thorn (Parkinsonia africana) Karee or willow rhus (Searsia lancea) and buffalo thorn (Ziziphus mucronata).  Fauna  Common mammals are kudu, oryx, springbok, steenbok, Hartmann's Mountain Zebra, red hartebeest and ostrich. There is also a small population of black rhino. Nearly 300 bird species are found here, including Yellow-billed stork, Osprey, African fish eagle, Goliath heron, Bradfield's swift and Stark's lark. The dam has one of the three largest Great white pelican breeding colonies in Namibia.  Recreation  Hardap is a popular angling area. Annual angling competitions are held. Permits are required and are obtained from the Hardap Regional Council office. Water sports such as canoeing and boating are permitted. There are two hiking trails in the park for day hikers. Game drives are permitted in the game park surrounding Hardap Dam, within the Resort area. Namibia Wildlife Resorts manages accommodation in the Park. Accommodation was upgraded during a four- year, N$40 million renovation period, and the resort reopened on 1 December 2015.The Namibian Newspaper Hardap has a restaurant, conference facilities, a swimming pool, 5 VIP Bungalows, 15 self-catering Family Chalets, 30 Bush Chalets, a dormitory and campsites.New Era Newspaper  Park Management  The Ministry of Environment and Tourism is responsible for park management.

The first approach uses a log-odds transformation of as a linear function of , i.e., \\\\operatorname{logit} y = \\\\log \\\\frac {y}{1-y} = x\\\\beta. This approach is problematic for two distinct reasons. The variable can not take on boundary values 1 and 0, and the interpretation of the coefficients is not straightforward. The second approach circumvents these issues by using the logistic regression as a link function. More specifically, : \\\\operatorname E[y \\\\lor x] = \\\\frac {\\\\exp(x\\\\beta)}{1+\\\\exp(x\\\\beta)} It immediately becomes clear that this set up is very similar to the binary logit model, with that difference that the variable can actually take on values in the unit interval.

It rises in the municipality of Bonstetten, flows through the narrow W√ºerital valley and reaches the Reppisch valley near Birmensdorf, wo it empties, parallel to the rather smaller Lunnerenbach, into the lower Reppisch. The W√ºeribach is the longest and biggest tributary of the Reppisch and has an average flow rate of 310 l/s.  Geography   Course  The W√ºeribach rises as the Dorfbach at in the forest area of Birch above Bonstetten. From here it flows initially mainly in a northwestern direction through the village of Bonstetten, much of it being canalized as it passes through. It leaves the village and runs, having been straightened out, through fields across a wide plain in a northern direction. Shortly afterwards the stream reaches the municipal boundary with Wettswil am Albis, where it is called the Fischbach. It passes to the west of the village and collects the waters of the roughly four-kilometre-long Fridgraben. It reaches the northern municipal boundary with Birmensdorf, where the stream snakes through the narrow W√ºerital into the Reppisch valley. This valley was formed in the last ice age as a meltwater gully of the Wettswiler and the Aescher Zunge of the Reuss Glacier. The W√ºeribach now reaches Birmensdorf, collects the Aescherbach from the left and finally discharges into the Reppisch at an elevation of .

The case of multiple treatments is relatively difficult to handle, as it can require additional functional form restrictions, especially when addressing the counterfactual or potential outcomes framework.

There are different approaches available to analyze multiple treatment effects.

Then the agent will choose alternative j such that Rj ‚â• Rk for all k‚â†j.

Other frameworks focus less on the choice dynamics and consider a random coefficient setting for the different treatment options, or use dummy variables for the different possible treatments.

D. Roy. The basic model considers two types of workers that choose occupation in one of two sectors. Original model Roy's original paper deals with workers selecting into fishing and hunting professions, where there is no uncertainty about the amount of goods (fish or rabbits) that will be caught in a given period, but fishing is more costly as it requires more skill. The central question that Roy tries to answer in the original paper is whether the best hunters will hunt and the best fishermen will fish. While the discussion is non-mathematical, it is observed that choices will depend on the distribution of skills, the correlation between these skills in the population, and the technology available to use these skills. Further developments George Borjas was the first to formalize the model of Roy in a mathematical sense and apply it to self-selection in immigration. Specifically, assume source country 0 and destination country 1, with log earnings in a country i given by wi= ai \\\\+ ei, where ei‚àºN(0, s_i^2 ). Additionally, assume there is a cost C associated with migrating from country 0 to country 1 and workers know all parameters and their own realization of e0 and e1. Borjas then uses the implications of the Roy model to infer something about what wages for immigrants in country 1 would have been had they stayed in country 0 and what wages for non-immigrants in country 0 would have been had they migrated. The third, and final, element needed for this is the correlation between the wages in the two countries, œÅ. A worker will choose to immigrate if a_1 - a_0 - C + e_1 - e_0 > 0 which will happen with probability 1-Œ¶(v) where v is \\\\frac {(a_{1} - a_{0}-{C})}{s_{v}} , sv is the standard deviation of e1 ‚Äì e0, and Œ¶ is the standard normal cdf. This leads to the famous central result that the expected wage for immigrants depends on the selection mechanism, as shown in equation (1), where œï is the standard normal pdf and, like before, Œ¶ is the standard normal cdf. : E[w_0 \\\\mid \\\\mathrm{Immigrate}] = a_0 + \\\\rho s_0 \\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\phi ({v})}{1-\\\\phi ({v}) }\\\\right) (1) While Borjas was the first to mathematically formalize the Roy model, it has guided thinking in other fields of research as well.

On the one hand, unobserved heterogeneity can play a crucial role when it comes to different sampling methods, such as stock or flow sampling. Salant, S. W. (1977): Search Theory and Duration Data: A Theory of Sorts. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 91(1), pp. 39-57 On the other hand, duration models have also been extended to allow for different subpopulations, with a strong link to mixture models. Many of these models impose the assumptions that heterogeneity is independent of the observed covariates, it has a distribution that depends on a finite number of parameters only, and it enters the hazard function multiplicatively. Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. One can define the conditional hazard as the hazard function conditional on the observed covariates and the unobserved heterogeneity. Lancaster, T. (1990): The Econometric Analysis of Transition Data. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. In the general case, the cumulative distribution function of ti* associated with the conditional hazard is given by F(t|xi , vi ; Œ∏). Under the first assumption above, the unobserved component can be integrated out and we obtain the cumulative distribution on the observed covariates only, i.e. G(t ‚à® xi ; Œ∏ , œÅ) = ‚à´ F (t ‚à® xi, ŒΩ ; Œ∏ ) h ( ŒΩ ; œÅ ) dŒΩ Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. where the additional parameter œÅ parameterizes the density of the unobserved component v. Now, the different estimation methods for stock or flow sampling data are available to estimate the relevant parameters. A specific example is described by Lancaster. Assume that the conditional hazard is given by Œª(t ; xi , vi ) = vi exp (x i Œ≤) Œ± t Œ±-1 where x is a vector of observed characteristics, v is the unobserved heterogeneity part, and a normalization (often E[vi] = 1) needs to be imposed. It then follows that the average hazard is given by exp(x'Œ≤) Œ±tŒ±-1. More generally, it can be shown that as long as the hazard function exhibits proportional properties of the form Œª ( t ; xi, vi ) = vi Œ∫ (xi ) Œª0 (t), one can identify both the covariate function Œ∫(.) and the hazard function Œª(.).

Under the normality assumption v~N(0,œÉ2), u = œÅv + Œµ must hold, where œÅ = cov(u , v)/œÉ2 and Œµ~N(0,1-œÅ2 œÉ2). Then the equation for y* can be rewritten as y* = x1 Œ≤ + zŒ¥ + œÅv + Œµ. This model can be consistently estimated by 2-Stage Least Square (2SLS): 1) Regress z on (x1, x2) and obtain the consistent estimator \\\\widehat{\\\\theta} and the residual \\\\hat{v} ; 2) Estimate the binary response model on (x1, z, \\\\hat{v}) and get the consistent estimator for the scaled coefficients (Œ≤œÅœÉ, Œ¥œÅœÉ, œÅœÅœÉ) ‚â° (Œ≤, Œ¥, œÅ)/; Then (y = 1‚îÇx, z) = Œ¶ ( x1 \\\\hat{\\\\beta}œÅœÉ \\\\+ z\\\\hat{\\\\delta}œÅœÉ \\\\+ \\\\hat{\\\\rho}œÅœÉ\\\\hat{v}) . Since the APE of variable \\\\tilde{w} at ( \\\\tilde{x} , \\\\tilde{z} ) is given by Ev [ \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\phi ( x_{1} \\\\beta_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} + z\\\\delta_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} + \\\\rho_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} v)} {\\\\partial \\\\tilde{w}} _(\\\\tilde{x} , \\\\tilde{z} )] By Law of Large Number, a consistent estimator is given as \\\\frac {1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\phi ( x_{1} \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} + z\\\\hat{\\\\delta}_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} + \\\\hat{\\\\rho}_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} \\\\hat{v}_i)} {\\\\partial \\\\tilde{w}} _(\\\\tilde{x} , \\\\tilde{z} ) This model can also be consistently estimated by conditional Maximum Likelihood Method.This issue can also be addressed under the Semiparametric setting, for more details, refere to: Richard W.

All the discussion above is mainly about the probit model. When the distribution assumption is changed, the same logic still applies.

It is characterized by the influence of previous values of the dependent variable on its present value, and by the presence of unobservable explanatory variables. The term ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù here means the dependence of the dependent variable on its past history; this is usually used to model the ‚Äústate dependence‚Äù in economics. For instance, for a person who cannot find a job this year, it will be harder to find a job next year because her present lack of a job will be a negative signal for the potential employers. ‚ÄúUnobserved effects‚Äù means that one or some of the explanatory variables are unobservable: for example, consumption choice of one flavor of ice cream over another is a function of personal preference, but preference is unobservable. Continuous dependent variable Censored dependent variable In a panel data tobit model,The model framework comes from But the author revises the model more general here. if the outcome Y_{i,t} partially depends on the previous outcome history Y_{i,0},\\\\ldots,Y_{t-1} this tobit model is called \\"dynamic\\". For instance, taking a person who finds a job with a high salary this year, it will be easier for her to find a job with a high salary next year because the fact that she has a high-wage job this year will be a very positive signal for the potential employers. The essence of this type of dynamic effect is the state dependence of the outcome. The \\"unobservable effects\\" here refers to the factor which partially determines the outcome of individual but cannot be observed in the data. For instance, the ability of a person is very important in job-hunting, but it is not observable for researchers. A typical dynamic unobserved effects tobit model can be represented as : Y_{i,t}=Y_{i,t}^1[Y_{i,t}>0]; : Y_{i,t}=z_{i,t}\\\\delta+\\\\rho y_{i,t-1}+c_{i}+u_{i,t}; : c_i\\\\mid y_{i,0},\\\\ldots, y_{i,t-1} \\\\sim F (y_{i,0}x_i); : u_{i,t}\\\\mid z_{i,t},y_{i,0},\\\\ldots,y_{i,t-1}\\\\sim N(0,1). In this specific model, \\\\rho y_{i,t-1} is the dynamic effect part and c_{i} is the unobserved effect part whose distribution is determined by the initial outcome of individual i and some exogenous features of individual i. Based on this setup, the likelihood function conditional on \\\\\\\\{y_{i,0}\\\\\\\\}^N_{i-1} can be given as : \\\\prod_{i=1}^N \\\\int f_\\\\theta(c_i \\\\mid y_{i,0},x_i) \\\\left[ \\\\prod_{t=1}^T\\\\Bigl(1[y_{i,t}=0][1-\\\\Phi(z_{i,t}\\\\delta+\\\\rho y_{i,t-1}>0] \\\\frac{\\\\varphi(z_{i,t}\\\\delta+\\\\rho y_{i,t-1}+c_i)}{\\\\Phi(z_{i,t} \\\\delta+\\\\rho y_{i,t-1}+c_i)}\\\\biggr) \\\\right] \\\\, dc_i For the initial values \\\\\\\\{y_{i,0}\\\\\\\\}^N_{i-1} ,there are two different ways to treat them in the construction of the likelihood function: treating them as constant, or imposing a distribution on them and calculate out the unconditional likelihood function. But whichever way is chosen to treat the initial values in the likelihood function, we cannot get rid of the integration inside the likelihood function when estimating the model by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Expectation Maximum (EM) algorithm is usually a good solution for this computation issue.For more details, refer to: Based on the consistent point estimates from MLE, Average Partial Effect (APE) can be calculated correspondingly. For more details, refer to: Binary dependent variable Formulation A typical dynamic unobserved effects model with a binary dependent variable is representedWooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass, pp 300. as: :P(y_{it} = 1 \\\\mid y_{i,t-1}, \\\\dots , y_{i,0}, z_i, c_i) = G (z_{it} \\\\delta + \\\\rho y_{i,t-1} + c_i) where ci is an unobservable explanatory variable, zit are explanatory variables which are exogenous conditional on the ci, and G(‚àô) is a cumulative distribution function. Estimates of parameters In this type of model, economists have a special interest in œÅ, which is used to characterize the state dependence. For example, yi,t can be a woman's choice whether to work or not, zit includes the i-th individual's age, education level, number of children, and other factors. ci can be some individual specific characteristic which cannot be observed by economists.James J. Heckman (1981): Studies in Labor Markets, University of Chicago Press, Chapter Heterogeneity and State Dependence It is a reasonable conjecture that one's labor choice in period t should depend on his or her choice in period t ‚àí 1 due to habit formation or other reasons. This dependence is characterized by parameter œÅ. There are several MLE-based approaches to estimate Œ¥ and œÅ consistently. The simplest way is to treat yi,0 as non-stochastic and assume ci is independent with zi. Then by integrating P(yi,t , yi,t-1 , ‚Ä¶ , yi,1 yi,0 , zi , ci) against the density of ci, we can obtain the conditional density P(yi,t , yi,t-1 , ... , yi,1 |yi,0 , zi). The objective function for the conditional MLE can be represented as: \\\\sum_{i=1}^N log (P (yi,t , yi,t-1, ‚Ä¶ , yi,1 yi,0 , zi)). Treating yi,0 as non-stochastic implicitly assumes the independence of yi,0 on zi. But in most cases in reality, yi,0 depends on ci and ci also depends on zi. An improvement on the approach above is to assume a density of yi,0 conditional on (ci, zi) and conditional likelihood P(yi,t , yi,t-1 , ‚Ä¶ , yt,1,yi,0 ci, zi) can be obtained. By integrating this likelihood against the density of ci conditional on zi, we can obtain the conditional density P(yi,t , yi,t-1 , ‚Ä¶ , yi,1 , yi,0 zi). The objective function for the conditional MLEGreene, W. H. (2003), Econometric Analysis , Prentice Hall , Upper Saddle River, NJ . is \\\\sum_{i=1}^N log (P (yi,t , yi,t-1, ‚Ä¶ , yi,1 yi,0 , zi)).

Through function G(\\\\cdot) , the probability of choosing to purchase is determined.For an application example, refer to: Rayton, B. A.

Now, suppose its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) \\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u} has an asymptotic distribution as \\\\sqrt {n} ( \\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u} - \\\\beta) \\\\xrightarrow{d} N (0, V) and there is a feasible consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance V denoted as \\\\hat {V} . Usually, there are two different types of hypothesis needed to be tested in binary response index model. The first type is testing the multiple exclusion restrictions, namely, testing \\\\beta_2 = 0 with =[\\\\beta_1; \\\\beta_2] where \\\\beta _ 2 \\\\in R^Q . If the unrestricted MLE can be easily computed, it is convenient to use the Wald test Greene, W. H. (2003), Econometric Analysis , Prentice Hall , Upper Saddle River, NJ . whose test statistic is constructed as: (D \\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u})^{T} (D\\\\hat {V}D^{T}/n)^{-1} (D\\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u}) \\\\xrightarrow{d} X_{Q}^{2} Where D is a diagonal matrix with the last Q diagonal entries as 0 and others as 1. If the restricted MLE can be easily computed, it is more convenient to use the Score test (LM test). Denote the maximum likelihood estimator under the restricted model as (\\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{r}) and define \\\\hat {u}_{i} \\\\equiv Y_i - G(X_i' \\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{r}), \\\\hat {G}_{i} \\\\equiv G(X_i' \\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{r}) and \\\\hat {g}_{i} \\\\equiv g(X_i' \\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{r}, where g(\\\\cdot) = G' (\\\\cdot) . Then run the OLS regression \\\\frac {\\\\hat {u}_{i}} {\\\\sqrt{(\\\\hat {G}_{i}(1-\\\\hat {G}_{i}) }} on \\\\frac {\\\\hat {g}_{i}} {\\\\sqrt{(\\\\hat {G}_{i}(1-\\\\hat {G}_{i}) }}X_{1i}', \\\\frac {\\\\hat {g}_{i}} {\\\\sqrt{(\\\\hat {G}_{i}(1-\\\\hat {G}_{i}) }}X_{2i}' , where X_i = [X_{1i} ; X_{2i} ] and X_{2i}\\\\varepsilon R^Q . The LM statistic is equal to the explained sum of squares from this regression Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and it is asymptotically distributed as X_Q^2 . If the MLE can be computed easily under both of the restricted and unrestricted models, Likelihood-ratio test is also a choice: let L_u denote the value of the log-likelihood function under the unrestricted model and let L_r denote the value under the restricted model, then 2(L_u - L_r) has an asymptotic X_Q^2 distribution. The second type is testing a nonlinear hypothesis about \\\\beta , which can be represented as H_0 : c(\\\\beta) = 0 where c(\\\\beta) is a Q√ó1 vector of possibly nonlinear functions satisfying the differentiability and rank requirements. In most of the cases, it is not easy or even feasible to compute the MLE under the restricted model when c(\\\\beta) include some complicated nonlinear functions. Hence, Wald test is usually used to deal with this problem. The test statistic is constructed as: c(\\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u}') [ abla_\\\\beta c(\\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u}) \\\\hat {V} abla_\\\\beta c(\\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u})']^{-1} c(\\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u}) \\\\xrightarrow{d} X_Q^2 where abla_\\\\beta c(\\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u}) is the Q√óN Jacobian of c(\\\\beta) evaluated at \\\\hat {\\\\beta}_{u} .

Trade and professional work  He became occupied with photography at the age of fourteen. He learned the photographer's trade in Senta with Martin Ronai and Danilo Jak≈°iƒá. During the war, Stevan went on with his education and progress. Keeping friends with the experienced Geza Barta in Novi Sad, he bought at his photo shop one of the first colour films and used it only for the most valuable shots. So, in 1943, \\"A Goose-girl\\", the photo of a young woman with a basket and geese in a Vojvodina alley, was taken. The photo, entitled \\"A Motif from Vojvodina Village\\" was published on the front cover of \\"Duga\\" magazine, No.313, which, in that way, in 1950, became the first illustrated magazine with the front cover in colour. Ivo Andriƒá, photo S. Kragujeviƒá Yul Brynner in Sarajevo, photo S. Kragujeviƒá Elizabeth II and Tito in Belgrade He was the first photojournalist of the Information Agency at the Presidium of SFRY, which was managed by Eva Biro, international public- relations person, and headed by Vladimir Dedijer. Among other photos, the first official portrait of President Tito, made by Kragujeviƒá in 1950, was intended for foreign embassies and correspondents. The photo is preserved in Kragujeviƒá's archives. Later in his career, Stevan made a rich stock of photos of President Tito, covering his trips around the country, visits to various companies, meetings with foreign statesmen, workmen, artists, citizens, or young people, but, apart from official photos, he took a series of anthological, unofficial ones. Because of that, many people considered him Tito's personal photographer ‚Äì which he was not. After that period (1949‚Äì1951), Stevan Kragujeviƒá became a member of the selected team of photographers in Tanjug (1951‚Äì1953), and from 1953 until retirement in 1982 a photojournalist and photo editor of the daily newspaper \\"Politika\\". During his work in \\"Politika\\", especially in the period of modernization (after moving to the new, present-day building) he held other important positions ‚Äì Chief of the Photolaboratory and Photo department of the company. For a long time he was the head of the Photo department, passed on his experience on his younger colleagues, organized very active day and nighttime-work of the photo editorial office, and especially improved the sense of responsibility and awareness of the importance of taking care of the films and the establishment of rich photographic archives. Until his retirement, he was also a photo editor and helped in introducing a new section in \\"Politika\\", especially the one stressing the real value and importance of photography (\\"U slici i reƒçi\\" ‚Äì \\" Through picture and Word\\")  Photographic documentation  With his ample work, Kragujeviƒá made a unique documentary chronology about the development of Yugoslavia, being an eyewitness, as a photojournalist, of all important political, cultural, artistic and sports events. As an accredited correspondent, he was present at all the events in the Yugoslav Assembly, Party and Union conventions, May-Day Parade and Youth Day, formation of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM, Brioni, 1956), about student protests in 1968, natural disasters and accidents (Skoplje earthquake, 1963).

Exhibitions  He took part at numerous international and Yugoslav exhibitions, and was also the author of special one- man shows, most often dedicated to his home town Senta. His first solo exhibition ‚Äì One hundred photographs by Stevan Kragujeviƒá was held in his native town Senta from April 28 to May 5, 1956. The last exhibition, in the Museum of the Town of Senta in March 2000, next to 65- year jubilee of dealing with photography ‚Äì symbolically represented Stevan's whole work.

Payne (18361907) was an American educator and translator. As professor of the Science and Art of Teaching at the University of Michigan in 1879, he was the first university professor of pedagogy in the United States. He served as the chancellor of the University of Nashville and the president of Peabody College (both of which later merged with Vanderbilt University) from 1887 to 1901. Early life William H. Payne was born on May 12, 1836, in Farmington, New York. He was educated in state schools in New York, which offered classes in the winter months, until he attended an academy for three years and a seminary for a couple of months. Much of his education was self- taught. Payne received a master of arts and a legum doctor from the University of Michigan. He received a doctorate from the University of Nashville. Career Payne taught schoolchildren in Victor, New York, in 1856-1857. He served as the principal of the Union School in Three Rivers, Michigan, from 1858 to 1864. He was the superintendent of schools in Niles, Michigan, from 1864 to 1866. He served as the principal of the Holy Ghost Seminary in Ypsilanti, Michigan, from 1866 to 1869. Meanwhile, from 1864 to 1869, he was the editor and publisher of The Michigan Teacher, a review of pedagogy. He served as superintendent of schools in Adrian, Michigan, from 1869 to 1879. Payne was appointed as the first professor of the Science and Art of Teaching at the University of Michigan by the Board of Regents in 1879. He was the first holder of a chair in pedagogy in any university in the United States. He established the Department of Education. Replacing the late Eben S. Stearns, Payne served as the second chancellor of the University of Nashville and the president of Peabody College from 1887 to 1901. He was critical in working with the Peabody Education Fund to shape the future of the college. Under his leadership, the faculty went from 12 to 38. When he stepped down, he was succeeded by former Governor James D. Porter, who moved the Peabody College campus across the street from Vanderbilt University. Meanwhile, Payne returned to the University of Michigan in 1901. Payne was the author of several books on pedagogy. He \\"consistently supported compulsory education, financed and supervised by the state.\\" Instead of experience, he encouraged \\"academic pursuits.\\" Moreover, he believed education to be \\"the most conservative of all arts.\\" Indeed, he opposed innovation in teaching methods. Furthermore, he believed women were not qualified to teach senior years, science or mathematics, nor were they qualified to serve as superintendent or chancellor. Payne translated Emile, or On Education by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and The History of Pedagogy by Gabriel Compayr√© from French into English. Personal life Payne married Eva S. Fort in October 1856. After she died in 1899, he married Elizabeth Clark in 1901. He had a son, W.R. Payne, and four daughters: Mrs Henry McClelland, Mrs Tillman Jones, Mrs John A. Murkin, and Mrs B.F. Fields. Death Payne died in June 1907.

This process of measurement is central to quantitative research because it provides a fundamental and measurable connection between empirical observation and mathematical expression of the quantitative relationships. It has been used in various areas of social sciences and has been the basis of many market research projects. Calculation One method of calculating outcome factorisation is as follow:Sun Ging-Yun, Empirical methodology in the tautological study of qualitative and quantitative social interaction data, Albany: State University of New York Press 1982 # Prepare a qualitative questionnaire asking the respondents to give a score of between ‚àí10 and +10. # Average out the scores. A weighted average can be used. Calculate the average of all the questionnaires from respondents # Calculate the inverse natural logarithm. This is the outcome factorisation (OF). This can be produced on excel spreadsheets by using the EXP(..) function. # This number can be divided by the cost (per day) to create the outcome factorisation per unit of currency ‚Äì UK ¬£ or US dollars. History The use of such a tool for epistemology and ontology in social science research has been referred to by Pierre Bourdieu.Pierre Bourdieu, The polythetic space of stochastic social science theory : Esquisse d'une th√©orie de la pratique, pr√©c√©d√© de trois √©tudes d'ethnologie kabyle, (1972), Eng.

The nature of the outcome results gives a fine balance between the Positivist and Interpretivist paradigms, Positivism and Interpretivism. The original theories of outcome factorisation are probably derived from discussions at the Albach Symposium in the 1960s which were held in the honor of Erwin Schr√∂dinger.Koestler A, Beyond reductionism, new perspectives in the life sciences : [proceedings of] the Albach Symposium 1968 London: Hutchinson & Co 1969 Notes References Quantitative research ","title":"Outcome factorisation"},{"id":"48674030","text":"Ingeborg Nyberg in 1958 Ingeborg Elisabeth Nyberg Roos, n√©e Nyberg (born 13 October 1940 in Sundsvall) is a Swedish singer and actress.Ericson Uno, Engstr√∂m Klas, red (1992).

Biography Smallwood was born in San Luis Obispo, California on March 24, 1915. He studied at Ventura High School and then Ventura Junior College, where he took up track and field. From 1935 he attended the University of Southern California (USC); at the time, the USC Trojans had a very strong track team under coach Dean Cromwell. Smallwood placed third in the 400 meters at the 1936 NCAA Championships; the Trojans won the team championship with a record points. Smallwood won the national (AAU) championship later that summer, defeating Jimmy LuValle and world record holder Archie Williams in a close race in 47.3. At the U.S. Olympic Trials a week after the AAU meet he placed second behind Williams, running an estimated 46.7; he qualified for the Summer Olympics in Berlin. En route to the Olympics Smallwood suffered an attack of appendicitis, which put his participation in the Games in doubt. Eventually, he was able to run in the heats and the quarter-finals, advancing from both; he had to withdraw before the semi-finals as his condition worsened. He underwent an emergency appendectomy in Berlin, but remained in weak health; complications, including pleurisy, nearly killed him in February 1937. Smallwood eventually recovered, and was named co-captain of the USC track team for the 1937‚Äì38 season. He died in Oxnard, California in April 1985.

McKibben was born with bilateral talipes (club foot) and underwent corrective surgery in the first weeks after his birth. Table tennis career McKibbin began playing table tennis at the age of four and continued playing throughout his youth, competing in the UK school championships. At the age of 16 his coach suggested that he try out for the Great Britain Paralympic team, even though McKibben did not see himself as having a disability. He was classified as a Class 8 table tennis player and represented Britain in the European Championships in Split in 2011. There he finished fourth in the men's singles Class 8. McKibbin qualified for the 2012 Summer Paralympics competing in both the Men's singles - Class 8 and the Men's team, Class 6-8. In the singles tournament, McKibbin was placed in Group B with China's Sun Churen and Belgium's Mathieu Loicq. McKibbin failed to progress through the preliminary rounds after losing both his matches. In the class 6-8 team event, McKibbin was joined by team mates Ross Wilson and Will Bayley. The British team were given a bye in the first round, facing Italy in the quarter-finals whom they beat 3-0. In the semi-finals Britain lost a close encounter to eventual gold medalists Poland, but a comprehensive win over Germany in the third place match saw the British team pick up the bronze medal, McKibbin's first major international medal. In 2015 McKibbin again teamed up with Ross Wilson at the Para Table Tennis European Championship where they won the bronze in the Class 8 Men's team event. In November that year McKibbin travelled to Beijing to take part in a PTT Open. At the open he beat Arufuahirokazu Tateishi of Japan (3-0) and former European champion Marcin Skrzynecki from Poland (3-1) to set up a final against World number two Ye Chaoqun of China.

It was discovered by Howard Carter in 1925 in tomb KV62 in the Valley of the Kings, and is now housed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The mask is one of the best-known works of art in the world. Bearing the likeness of Osiris, Egyptian god of the afterlife, it is tall, weighs over or 321.5 Troy Ounces, and is decorated with semi-precious stones. An ancient spell from the Book of the Dead is inscribed in hieroglyphs on the mask's shoulders. The mask had to be restored in 2015 after its plaited beard fell off and was hastily glued back on by museum workers. According to Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves, the mask is \\"not only the quintessential image from Tutankhamun's tomb, it is perhaps the best-known object from ancient Egypt itself.\\" Since 2001, research has suggested that it may originally have been intended for Queen Neferneferuaten; her royal name (Ankhkheperure) was found in a partly erased cartouche on the inside of the mask.  Discovery  Tutankhamun's burial chamber was found at the Theban Necropolis in the Valley of the Kings in 1922 and opened in 1923. It would be another two years before the excavation team, led by the English archaeologist Howard Carter, was able to open the heavy sarcophagus containing Tutankhamun's mummy. On 28 October 1925, they opened the innermost of three coffins to reveal the gold mask, seen by people for the first time in approximately 3,250 years. Carter wrote in his diary: > The pins removed, the lid was raised. The penultimate scene was disclosed ‚Äì > a very neatly wrapped mummy of the young king, with golden mask of sad but > tranquil expression, symbolizing Osiris ‚Ä¶ the mask bears that god's > attributes, but the likeness is that of Tut.Ankh.Amen ‚Äì placid and > beautiful, with the same features as we find upon his statues and coffins. > The mask has fallen slightly back, thus its gaze is straight up to the > heavens. In December 1925, the mask was removed from the tomb, placed in a crate and transported to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where it remains on public display.  Mask  The mask is tall, wide and deep. It is fashioned from two layers of high-karat gold, varying from in thickness, and weighing . X-ray crystallography has revealed that the mask contains two alloys of gold: a lighter 18.4 karat shade for the face and neck, and 22.5 karat gold for the rest of the mask. The face represents the pharaoh's standard image, and the same image was found by excavators elsewhere in the tomb, in particular in the guardian statues. He wears a nemes headcloth, topped by the royal insignia of a cobra (Wadjet) and vulture (Nekhbet), symbolising Tutankhamun's rule of both Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt respectively. The ears are pierced to hold earrings, a feature that appears to have been reserved for queens and children in almost all surviving ancient Egyptian works of art. It contains inlays of coloured glass and gemstones, including lapis lazuli (the eye surrounds and eyebrows), quartz (the eyes), obsidian (the pupils), carnelian, feldspar, turquoise, amazonite, faience and other stones (as inlays of the broad collar).  Beard  When it was discovered in 1925, the narrow gold beard, inlaid with blue lapis lazuli, giving it a plaited effect, had become separated from the mask, but it was reattached to the chin using a wooden dowel in 1944. In August 2014, the beard fell off when the mask was taken out of its display case for cleaning. The museum workers responsible used quick- drying epoxy in an attempt to fix it, leaving the beard off-center. The damage was noticed in January 2015 and has been repaired by a German-Egyptian team who reattached it using beeswax, a natural material used by the ancient Egyptians. In January 2016, it was announced that eight employees of the Egyptian Museum were to stand trial for allegedly ignoring scientific and professional methods of restoration and causing permanent damage to the mask. A former director of the museum and a former director of restoration were among those facing prosecution. As of January 2016, the date of the trial remains unknown.  Inscription  Back of the mask A protective spell is inscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphs on the back and shoulders in ten vertical and two horizontal lines. The spell first appeared on masks in the Middle Kingdom, 500 years before Tutankhamun, and was used in Chapter 151 of the Book of the Dead. > Thy right eye is the night bark (of the sun-god), thy left eye is the day- > bark, thy eyebrows are (those of) the Ennead of the Gods, thy forehead is > (that of) Anubis, the nape of thy neck is (that of) Horus, thy locks of hair > are (those of) Ptah-Sokar. (Thou art) in front of the Osiris (Tutankhamun). > He sees thanks to thee, thou guidest him to the goodly ways, thou smitest > for him the confederates of Seth so that he may overthrow thine enemies > before the Ennead of the Gods in the great Castle of the Prince, which is in > Heliopolis ‚Ä¶ the Osiris, the King of Upper Egypt Nebkheperure [Tutankhamun's > throne-name], deceased, given life by Re. Osiris was the Egyptian god of the afterlife. Ancient Egyptians believed that kings preserved in the likeness of Osiris would rule the Kingdom of the Dead. It never totally replaced the older cult of the sun, in which dead kings were thought to be reanimated as the sun-god Re, whose body was made of gold and lapis lazuli. This confluence of old and new beliefs resulted in a mixture of emblems inside Tutankhamun's sarcophagus and tomb.  Bead necklace  Although it is usually removed when the mask is on display, it has a triple- string necklace of gold and blue faience disc-beads with lotus flower terminals and uraeus clasps.

It was held in the United Kingdom. The meeting had been planned to have been held by Vanuatu at the end of 2017, but was moved to the United Kingdom after the impact of Cyclone Pam on the infrastructure of Vanuatu. The meeting was then postponed to April 2018 due to other international commitments. The position of Commonwealth Chair-in- Office, held by the government leader of the CHOGM host country, was transferred at the summit from the Prime Minister of Malta to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who will hold the post until the 26th CHOGM (expected in 2020). Agenda The theme of the summit was \\"Towards a Common Future\\". The British hosts set out four main goals for the summit: *prosperity: boosting intra-Commonwealth trade and investment *security: increasing cooperation across security challenges including global terrorism, organised crime and cyber attacks *fairness: promoting democracy, fundamental freedoms and good governance across the Commonwealth *sustainability: building the resilience of small and vulnerable states to deal with the effects of climate change and other global crises Under consideration were: A Commonwealth Blue Charter on ocean governance, a Commonwealth connectivity agenda for trade and investment, a declaration on cybercrime, and revised Commonwealth guidelines on election observation in member countries. Trade This was the first CHOGM held following the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union, a decision which has resulted in calls for Britain to strengthen its economic ties with and play a greater role in the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, as of 2018, was responsible for one- tenth of British trade compare to the EU with which the UK currently conducts half of its trade. Intra-Commonwealth trade, overall, is expected to increase by at least 17% to around US$700 billion by 2020. The British government reportedly hoped to use the CHOGM to open negotiations for expanded trade with Commonwealth nations to replace lost trade with the EU, however, as the summit began The Economist dismissed the belief that the Commonwealth could fill the gap created by Brexit as ‚Äúan amiable delusion‚Äù. Head of the Commonwealth and the Royals The succession of the Headship of the Commonwealth, and the roles of other members of the Royal Family was discussed, and a proposal to nominate Queen Elizabeth II for the Nobel Peace Prize is also expected to feature in discussions. At a speech welcoming Commonwealth leaders to Buckingham Palace on the first day of the summit, the Queen said \\"It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949.\\" On 20 April, the second day of the summit, the Commonwealth leaders agreed that Prince Charles would succeed the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth. LGBT rights The British government was accused by LGBT activists of backing away from plans to make LGBT rights in the Commonwealth of Nations an issue during the summit. Homosexuality remains a criminal offence in 37 out of 53 Commonwealth states. LGBT-rights campaigners from the UK and across the Commonwealth picketed Marlborough House, the headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat, on 19 April in order to draw attention to the issue. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said in a speech to Commonwealth leaders that she \\"deeply regrets\\" Britain's role in having same-sex conduct criminalized in colonial laws that remain in force in many Commonwealth countries, saying of these laws that ‚ÄúThey were wrong then and they are wrong now‚Äù and that the UK government supports the reform of these laws in former colonies. Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance The UK promised to spend ¬£61m to combat the pollution of the world's oceans by plastics and announced that it would ban plastic straws, microbeads, and other waste and to help developing countries curb plastics and other environmental pollutants from contaminating the oceans, and urged other Commonwealth countries to do the same. Five countries have joined the Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance: the UK, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Vanuatu and Ghana. Commonwealth Cyber Declaration The Commonwealth unanimously adopted the Commonwealth Cyber Declaration with leaders agreeing to work closely to strengthen their cybersecurity frameworks and response mechanisms by 2020.https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/commonwealth-countries- adopt-commonwealth-cyber-declaration-1524470490-1 Notable attendees Foreign ministers present at CHOGM 2018 * Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand; this was her first time attending CHOGM. * Adama Barrow, President of the Gambia; after the Gambia had returned to its status as a Commonwealth republic on 8 February 2018. * Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India; marking the first time since CHOGM 2011 that a Prime Minister of India has attended the summit. *South African President Cyril Ramaphosa had to leave the summit early, returning to South Africa to deal with riots in North West province. *Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister, Sibusiso Moyo, was in London and requested to attend the summit as an observer in an attempt by the country to re-engage with the Commonwealth following the departure of longtime President Robert Mugabe. Moyo's presence would have been the first time Zimbabwe has attended a CHOGM in any capacity since leaving the Commonwealth in 2003. Moyo met various Commonwealth leaders on the sidelines of the summit, and the UK expressed its support for readmitting Zimbabwe to the Commonwealth, but Moyo was not permitted to attend the summit itself as the Commonwealth has no provision for observer status. *Julie Bishop, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia) Overall, 47 out of 53 Commonwealth states were represented at the summit by their heads of government, with foreign ministers being the most senior attendees of the remaining countries. Outcomes The leaders issued a Communiqu√© at the close of the summit in which they: *committed their countries to ratifying and implementing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,https://www.chogm2018.org.uk/sites/default/files/CHOGM%202018%20Communique.pdf *\\"mainstream youth priorities into national development policies and plans\\", *\\"address the stigma around disability in all its forms and manifestations\\", *agreed to Report of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group on the Commonwealth's fundamental political values, *adopted the Revised Commonwealth Guidelines on Election Observation in Member Countries *called for strengthening the international response to the large movement of refugees, including return to their country of origin in safety and dignity *\\"adopted a Declaration on the Commonwealth Connectivity Agenda for Trade and Investment and mandated the Secretariat to develop an accompanying action plan that considers capacity building and hard and soft connectivity\\" *adopted the Commonwealth Blue Charter on sustainable development and protection of the world's oceans *adopted a Commonwealth Cyber Declaration that \\"reflects Commonwealth values, and sets out a common commitment to an open, democratic peaceful and secure internet, respecting human rights and freedom of expression\\" *called for a strengthening of the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention *agreed to work together to combat climate change ‚Äì particularly with reference to \\"small island developing states\\" *to coordinate efforts countering extremism as well as human trafficking. *agreed that Rwanda will host the next CHOGM in 2020 and that Samoa would host the CHOGM 2022.

He is crediting with establishing the famed Thikse Monastery and the remotely located Phugtal Monastery in Ladakh, in the North Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Biography Birth and early years Jangsem Sherab Zangpo is believed to have been born in 1395 in the village of Karma, in the Kham region of Tibet. Some claim that he was born in the village of Bershi, in the Nanchen county of Kham. He was the son of Bege Tongpon Rilu and Akyima. At the age of seven, he received lay vows from Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama, the fifth Gyalwa Karmapa of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. Design was on his way to or from China, gave Jangsen the name, Sherab Zangpo. After deciding to devote his life to religion, went off to study the traditions of the Karma Kagyu school under the Lamas of the Karma Gon Monastery. Choje Chopel Zangpo, a disciple of the first Pakpa Lha and Drukpa Gyelwang Choje, along with Rinchen Pelwai Khenpo, imparted Jangsem his basic education. The two teachers, along with Jamchopa Jamyang Drakpa, taught him sutras and tantra. He trained in particular in texts related to Avalokite≈õvara, VajravƒÅrahƒ´, Dharmapala Bernagchen (a form of MahƒÅkƒÅla, Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ and BodhisattvacaryƒÅvatƒÅra. At around the age to twenty-three, Jangsem travelled around Tiber for eleven years, including six years spent at the Ganden Monastery and three at the Drepung Monastery. There, he got the chance to study with Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa, Gyeltsabje Darma Rinchen, Khedrubje Gelek Pelzang and other learned Lamas. Tsongkhapa imparted to him his two main treatises the Lamrim Chenmo and the Ngakrim Chenmo, teachings on logic, M≈´lamadhyamakakƒÅrikƒÅ, extensive commentary on the GuhyasamƒÅja Tantra, the commentary on the Kalachakra Tantra of Vimalaprabha, the Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra and Naro Cho Druk. He also trained in the Jonang school of Tibetan Buddhism, working with Sonam Rinchenpa and Tsetang Shakya Sanggye. Jangsem also trained with Sakya lamas and studied the collected works of Sakya Pandita. Propagation of Buddhism Urged by his teachers, Jangsem returned to Kham in 1426, along with a lot of disciples. He travelled the Kham region, forging ties with the local religious and political leaders, and spreading Buddhism, and performing, rituals at monasteries such as the Kyoda Monastery of the Sakya tradition. He taught the Lamrim Chenmo and the Ngakrim Chenmo, Kala Chakra, GuhyasamƒÅja, and other texts. In 1437, at the request of his disciples, he set up the important Gelug monastery, Chamdo Chokhor Jampa Ling, also known as Kelden Jampa Ling, at the confluence of two tributaries of the Mekong, Ngomchu and Dzachu. It grew to be the largest Gelug monastery in Kham. In the early 15th century, Je Tsongkhapa instructed Jangsem and five of his other disciples to Ladakh to spread Buddhism. Jangsem was given a small statue of Amitayus (the sambhogakƒÅya form of AmitƒÅbha), containing bone powder and a drop of Tsongkhapa's own blood, and asked to carry a message for the King of Ladakh, seeking his help in the propagation of Buddhism in the area. The King, who was then staying in the Nubra Valley near Shey, loved the gift of the statue. After this meeting, the King directed his minister to help Jangsen to establish a monastery of the Gelug order in Ladakh. As a result, in 1433, he founded a small village monastery called Lhakhang Serpo \\"Yellow Temple\\" in Stagmo, north of the Indus. This was the beginning of the famous Thikse Monastery. In the mid-15th century, Palden Zangpo, a disciple of Jangsem, continued the monastic work started by his teacher and expanded the monastery. Jangsem is also credited with establishing the present Phuktal Monastery in the early 15th century. The eminent scholars and brothers Dangsong, Pun, and Sum, who were believed to have the supernatural power of flight gave teachings on Dharma at Phuktal. When Jangsem Sherap Zangpo arrived at Phuktal, the three brothers bequeathed the holy site to him and departed. According to legend, the spiritually gifted Zangpo caused a spring to appear and run from the cave, a tree to grow on top of the cave and for the cave itself to grow larger in size. Then, under his guidance, the present structure of the monastery was built around the cave. It is built in the cliffside, like a honeycomb. The cliff is part of a lateral gorge of a major tributary of the Lungnak River (Lingti-Tsarap River). The monastery today is home to about 70 monks and houses a main temple, prayer rooms, a library with rare sacred texts, apartments and living quarters, teaching facilities, a kitchen, and of course, the original cave and the sacred spring, which is protected. Jangsem Sherab Zangpo died in 1457 at the age of sixty- three.

When a military coup ousted Allende from power in 1973, the Movement sought to end the dictatorship.  Support for Allende  American Leftist groups supported the democratic efforts to elect the Socialist Salvador Allende and showed continued support him during his presidency. In 1972, Eric Leenson, returned from a Fulbright in Chile, helped establish Non-Intervention in Chile (NICH). The group stood in solidarity with Allende supporters within Chile and sent out newsletters from their Berkeley office to inform solidarity groups across the United States.  Opposition to the Pinochet Dictatorship: 1973-1990  The Socialist Allende government of Chile fell to a U.S.-involved military coup d'√©tat on September 11, 1973. The Pinochet regime targeted and forced the disappearance of political opposition. At least 200,000 people left Chile as exiles and settled, in highest numbers, in Europe and North America.Wright, Thomas C., Z√∫√±iga, Rody O√±ante (2007). \\"Chilean Political Exile\\", Latin American Perspectives 34 (4) In exile, the Chilean left established an \\"external front\\" to fight the dictatorship. They joined with allies and created a culturally vibrant and politically diverse solidarity movement with the Chilean Left. U.S. solidarity groups operated in New York, Berkeley, CA, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere.Non-Intervention in Chile, Chile Newsletter, 1 (8), June‚ÄìJuly 1974. http://freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC51_scans/51.chile.newsletter.1974.pdf.pdf Movement groups operated out of Amsterdam, London, and other European cities.  Radio  Movement participants used this non-mainstream media in many of the same ways that contemporary movements use social media, because media in Chile during the dictatorship was severely controlled by the Pinochet regime. Rosalind Bresnahan writes, \\"In the early hours of the coup, radio had the greatest potential for organizing resistance. Not surprisingly, one of the junta's first acts was the order the pro-UP stations to ease transmissions or face aerial bombardment.\\"Bresnahan, Rosalind (2002) \\"The Democratic Movement in Chile 1973-1990: Independent and Grass Roots Voices During the Pinochet Dictatorship,\\" Journal of Radio Studies, Vol. 9, No. 1 The Pinochet regime expropriated 40 stations, and most were linked to form Radio Nacional. In 1980, Pinochet enacted Article 6(b) in Chile's State Security Law. The law granted discretionary power to the regime to control media and restrict free speech. It became illegal to \\"publicly slander, libel, or offend the president of the Republic or any other high-level government, military, and police officials.\\" The threat to free speech restricted the oppositional movement to Pinochet within Chile, and affected the solidarity movement's access to information within Chile. Short wave radio helped to spread information in the international arena. Radio Moscow produced daily segments about Chile, \\"mostly speeches and commentaries because [they] didn't have much information.\\" They also reported on friends' and families' testimonies from within Chile. From 1974-1975 Radio Moscow read letters that arrived most often indirectly from Chile to Moscow that denounced cases of human rights violations. Radio programming in solidarity with Chile also came from Radio Prague, Havana, and Berlin.  Newsletters  To communicate between the local groups, several solidarity organizations produced and distributed newsletters. The North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) spread information and calls to action in their magazine Report on the Americas, consistently during the Dictatorship. Of any other U.S. journal, NACLA served as the greatest source of information about Chile for people in the U.S. The arts Political art played a central role in the movement. Activists used concerts, poster art, and arpilleras to promote Chilean culture, denounce the dictatorship, and support the movement. At Glide Church in San Francisco, activists presented a Salvador Allende Memorial Poetry Reading. The event took place on October 4, 1973, just one month after the coup. In Berkeley, CA in June 1975, Chilean exiles and movement activists joined together to create La Pe√±a Cultural Center. Traditionally, a Pe√±a is a Chilean meeting place for socially conscious conversation and culture. Here, the Bay Area movement held meetings, concerts, and housed their movement office. The musicians of Grupo Ra√≠z met at La Pe√±a, and performed around the world to educate about Latin American social struggles. The Nueva Canci√≥n group's members included Rafael Manriquez, Quique Cruz, Fernando \\"Fe√±a\\" Torres, Hector Salgado, and Elizabeth Lichi Fuentes. In 1982, the group sang with Pete Seeger for a movement solidarity concert at the Berkeley Community Theatre.  La Esmeralda Protest  La Esmeralda is a Chilean Naval ship known to be a site of torture and detention during the dictatorship. It was docked in the port of Valparaiso, Chile then sent to tour around the world. On Friday morning, June 21, 1974, La Esmeralda was set to dock at the Oakland Naval Supply Depot. Movement activists attempted to block the dock, and hung a \\"Junta No\\" banner from the Golden Gate Bridge in protest. In solidarity, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union obstructed the ship from entering the harbor.

The Team was created as a conclusion of the European Council meeting on 19 and 20 March 2015, citing the \\"need to challenge Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns\\". The task force's flagship project is EUvsDisinfo, a state media outlet that maintains a blacklist of articles and media which the organization labels as disinformation.  Mission and objectives  The East Stratcom Team is intended to develop dedicated communication material on priority issues, where EU strategic communication needs to be improved or the EU is subject to disinformation campaigns. Such products will be put at the disposal of the EU's political leadership, press services, EU delegations and EU Member States and are intended for the widest possible public audience. The Team is designated to develop communication campaigns, targeting key audiences and focused on specific issues of relevance to those audiences, including local issues. The actions of the East Stratcom Team are built on existing work and coherent with wider EU communication efforts, including activities of the EU institutions and EU Member States.  Key Task Force products  The team's communications products are mainly focused on the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood and produced in the local languages of those countries. They are disseminated via the social media channels of the EU Delegations in the region, and are also carried on television and via other media and public events. Material has been copied from this source. Reuse is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged. In addition, the Task Force, in cooperation with the European Commission, led the EU's six month Eastern Partnership communications campaign culminating in the November 2017 Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels. The team's main product to raise awareness of disinformation is the weekly Disinformation Review (in English and Russian languages), launched in November 2015. The goal is to provide data for analysts, journalists and officials dealing with this issue. The Disinformation Review also brings the latest news and analyses of what the task force labels as \\"pro-Kremlin disinformation\\". British journalist Edward Lucas described the Disinformation Review as \\"the best weekly disinformation bulletin anywhere in the West\\". The full record of the Task Force's work on disinformation is available on its website EUvsDisinfo.eu, available in English, Russian, and German languages. The team also runs the European External Action Service's Russian language website, as well as Twitter and Facebook accounts. This communicates primarily about the EU's foreign policy by publishing information about EU activities, as well as EU statements and press releases with relevance to the Eastern Neighbourhood in particular.  Reception EU Member State Governments have strongly supported the Task Force since its inception and provide the majority of its staff. The European Parliament has consistently supported the Task Force and called for adequate staffing and resourcing. An EP preparatory action for 2018 ‚Äì \\"StratCom Plus\\" - has allocated ‚Ç¨1.1m for the team to focus on how to counter disinformation on the EU more systematically. * Pavel Telicka, Vice-President of the European Parliament: \\"I place great value in the fact that Europe has experts who address Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns (‚Ä¶). The quality and the substance of their work is outstanding. Their work is valuable as it indicated the alarming nature of our European security\\". * Keir Giles from Chatham House about East StratCom Task Force: \\"a critically important capability, ESTF has quite a high credit among experts\\". * European Security Union Commissioner Julian King noted that East Stratcom Task Force \\"gathered more than 3,500 examples of pro-Kremlin disinformation contradicting publicly available facts repeated on many languages on many occasions‚Äù; \\"It also launched a Russian language service from Brussels, providing updates and fact-based background information about the Union for RU language journalists. The aim is to increase visibility and more accurate representation of EU policies in the Russian language media. It produces a weekly Disinformation review. Their Twitter account ensures that the Task Force's products reach up to 2 million people per month, in addition to their regular briefings. This work is very important\\". * Rebecca Harms, Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Germany and member of the Greens group: \\"It's important to have this Stratcom, but its interaction with national bodies is not strong enough\\". * Former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said that: \\"They provide an excellent instrument. We would of course not be able to do it in other ways\\". * Former Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka: \\"This team is capable of generating quality results\\". * Edward Lucas, vice president at Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said that the East StratCom's Disinformation Review is \\"the best weekly bulletin on Russian propaganda in the West\\" next after Ukrainian similar project, StopFake, which he considers to be \\"the gold standard\\". * According to The New York Times, East Stratcom serves as \\"Europe‚Äôs front line against this onslaught of fake news\\". * Canadian Maclean's magazine: \\"As for who first noticed that Moscow was gunning for Freeland, that‚Äôs something that has yet to show up in any banner Canadian headlines. It was the European Union‚Äôs East StratCom Task Force, a unit of the External Action Service (the EU‚Äôs foreign ministry and diplomatic branch). The Task Force was set up in March 2015 as a kind of early warning system to detect incoming Kremlin disinformation campaigns\\". * East StratCom Task Force in EUobserver: \\"Eight member states have urged the EU's foreign service to significantly expand its work on countering Russian propaganda. They said in a letter to EU head of foreign affairs Federica Mogherini that \\"in the face of unabated third party disinformation campaigns ‚Ä¶ we see an urgent need to further enhance the EU's StratCom capabilities (‚Ä¶) East StratCom circulates online notes that debunk Russian disinformation and has attracted 30,000 followers to its Twitter account. It also promotes positive coverage of the EU in former Soviet states\\". More in EUobserver: \\"Its Disinformation Review, a weekly newsletter, and its daily tweets and infographics, should be in the laptops and phones of all MEPs and senior EU officials\\". * Lawfare Blog about the team: \\"The task force has made some meaningful contributions to the efforts to counter disinformation warfare. Over the course of its operation, East StratCom has identified over 3,500 disinformation cases (‚Ä¶) These statistics highlight the global nature of the problem, and the benefit of having a body working on disinformation beyond a single country‚Äôs borders. East StratCom‚Äôs supranational view also allows it to provide valuable insights into the broader strategy and goals of pro-Kremlin disinformation operations because it can see them as a cohesive whole, rather than isolated incidents in individual countries.  Criticism  An article published October 2016 on Kommunikationsforum analyses the sources East StratCom use for debunking alleged disinformation. It criticizes the top three sites, Ukrainian StopFake, EU and NATO, for not being objective credible sources in this regard. An opinion piece written by Danish commentator, Iben Thranholm, published on Russia Insider October 2015, were listed by East StratCom as pro-Kremlin disinformation . Member of the Danish Parliament, Marie Krarup (Danish People's Party), upon discovery raised the issue in January 2017, demanding Foreign Minister, Anders Samuelsen, to take action and stop ‚Äòblack listing‚Äô of opinions, which he declined as the listing in his view was correctly labeled 'disinformation in support for Russia'. In response 28 commentators wrote a joint critique in the Berlingske Tidende stressing their concern that ‚Äòanybody with a critical view on mass immigration could end up in the black book of EU‚Äô. An article published October 2016 on Folkets Avis lists several instances, where East StratCom has labelled critique of non Western immigration to EU as pro-Kremlin disinformation, regardless that neither the media or the content has any relation to Russia. Research conducted by investigative journalists at Danish newspaper Politiken showed that East StratCom along with Western media falsely blamed separatists, not government forces, in Eastern Ukraine for initiating an offensive in the area of Avdiivka in January 2017. Sources used by East StratCom included Ukrainian website Inform Napalm which the article shows has ties to Ukrainian nationalist website Myrotvorets. Then Foreign Minister, Anders Samuelsen, stated that his staff would hold dialogues with the team to avoid anything that could cast doubt on the work and intentions of East StratCom. Upon discovery of being listed for publishing pro-Kremlin disinformation, three Dutch media organisations (GeenStijl, The Post Online and De Gelderlander) sued the EU for libel. On 6 March 2018, a majority of 109 votes to 41 of the Dutch Parliament voted to close EUvsDisinfo. On 8 March 2018, East StratCom announced they had deleted the listings of Dutch media in their database \\"following a detailed review\\". On 9 March 2018, Dutch Minister of the Interior, who had previously opposed closing EUvsDisinfo, said that the government would make a case for closing it in the European Union. On 13 March 2018 the three Dutch media withdrew their case.  Law on illegal foreign influence  In November 2018 the Danish Government presented a bill to counter foreign influence which imposed up to 12 years of prison for sharing ‚Äòdisinformation‚Äô in corporation with foreign intelligence services. Through the Danish Ministry of Defense, Denmark's oldest newspaper Berlingske obtained a four-page document produced by the East StratCom Task Force, with 11 alleged examples of Russian disinformation used as an internal document for the bill. The document was published in an article titled \\"Not a single example of influence operations against Denmark: ¬ªGovernment whipping up a mood¬´\\" The examples were: # Downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 # Swedish Minister of Defense weapons deal with Ukraine #Criminal case of Lisa F. # Bombing of humanitarian convoy in Aleppo, September 2016 #Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections # German troops raping Lithuanian girl. # Denmark to open brothels for zoophiles. # The 2017 French presidential election. #Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury #Douma chemical attack. # A segment about Danish island of Bornholm on Russian NTV. Former military researcher as well as civil rights organizations, think tanks and scholars criticized the government for not having any solid basis for the law. Legal experts criticized the government for introducing more uncertainty in due process. Judges also raised concern about the law and Amnesty International proposed the government scrapped the bill in its entirety due to limitations of freedom of speech. An independent report delivered to the Judicial committee in the parliament debunked the eleven examples categorizing each of the examples in ranges from ‚Äòundocumented‚Äô to ‚Äòfabricated‚Äô by East StratCom Task Force. The bill was made into law March 2019.  COVID-19  Members of the ‚ÄòRussian media research project‚Äô at the University of Manchester were asked to comment on material in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic published on EUvsDisinfo and found the material they analyzed ‚Äòtroubling‚Äô concluding the EU-founded body set up to fight disinformation has ended up producing it. The researchers noted two methods they found particularly problematic: First, the context in which individual sentences were extracted from the source materials and rephrased in the form of summaries and headlines which make them sound particularly outrageous. An example was a theory claiming that COVID-19 ‚Äòwas probably created on purpose at the UK‚Äôs Porton Down laboratories‚Äô while there was no indication in the EUvsDinsinfo database that the theory is rebuffed by the show‚Äôs co-moderater who repeatedly says he does not believe the conspiracy theories surrounding coronavirus. Second, what the researchers label as blatant distortions done by EUvsDisinfo. These distortions include an hour- long radio program in which the two participants briefly disagrees about historical parallels and which misleadingly is entitled ‚ÄòCoronavisus is an attempt by the Anglo-Saxons to control China‚Äô on EUvsDisinfo. Other examples include EUvsDisinfo attributing claims to RT Arabic for merely reporting claims made by others and inclusion of an article in the EUvsDisinfo database denying that Russia is waging a disinformation campaign around COVID-19 on questionable grounds. The research project included an analysis of 300 articles from RT on COVID-19 of which the researchers found ‚Äú23 to deal with conspiracy theories, and the overwhelming majority of these amount to rebuttals of western media accusations of Russian conspiracy mongering, or mockeries of conspiracy theories touted by others. Typical examples include ridiculing a conspiracy theory tweeted by a Hollywood actress; and dismissing as ‚ÄòRussophobic‚Äô US State Department accusations of Russian conspiracy-theory dissemination\\". The researchers concludes that ‚ÄúThe European Commission‚Äôs reliance on East StratCom is jeopardising its credibility as an evidence- driven policymaker. It is giving valuable ammunition to Russian state media counterclaims that it is the EU itself which produces disinformation. ‚Äú  See also  * Counterpropaganda * Fake news * Fact checking  References   External links  * EUvsDisinfo * European External Action Service - Russian language site Foreign relations of the European Union European External Action Service Political communication Disinformation ","title":"East StratCom Task Force"},{"id":"48674195","text":"Modus is a Swedish television psychological thriller series, directed by Lisa Siwe and Mani Maserrat,TV4 storsatsar p√• Nordic noir i Modus ; retrieved 28 November 2015. based upon the novel Frukta inte by Norwegian author and lawyer Anne Holt and adapted for television by Emmy Award winning writers Mai Brostr√∏m and Peter Thorsboe.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture and Rock-cut architecture, the temple is located in the Salem - Namakkal- Trichy Road. The legend of the temple is associated with Narasimha, an avatar of Hindu god Vishnu appearing for Lakshmi, his consort, and Hanuman. Based on the architectural features, historians believe that the temple was built during the 8th century. The temple has a pillared hall leading to the sanctum, which has rock-cut architecture. The temple is open from 7:00 am ‚Äì 1:00 pm and 4:30 - 8:00 pm. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which fifteen-day Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April) when the image of presiding deities are taken around the streets of the temple, being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Narasimha slaying Hiranyakasipu As per Hindu legend, Hiranyakasipu, a demon king, was troubling the Devas (celestial deities) as he got a boon from Brahma that no human can kill him, neither could he be killed in morning, noon or night nor in air, water or ground. His son Prahlada was an ardent devotee of Vishnu, garnering the hate of his father. Hiranyakasipu tried to slay Prahalada at various times, just to be saved by the divine grace of Vishnu. During the last heated argument between the two, Hiranyakasipu was asking if Vishnu was present everywhere and went on to break a pillar with his weapon. Vishnu took the avatar of Narasimha and came out of the opening in the pillar. Narasimha was a half-human with a lion face and slayed Hiranyakasipu on an evening time in a doorway, which was neither land nor air. Ages past by, when Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu was doing penance at this place, seeking his boons. Hanuman (locally called Anjaneyar) was carrying an image made of Saligrama and Lakshmi requested him to help her with a view of Vishnu in the form of Narasimha. Hanuman entrusted the saligrama to her and requested her to hold it until he returns. Lakshmi could not bear the weight and placed the image at this place, which grew into a mount before Hanuman could return. Narasimha appeared before both of them and set his abode at this place. History The temple is believed to be built during the 8th century by the Pandya kings in Rock-cut architecture. Historian Soundara Rajan places the date to a pre-Varagunan I (800‚Äì830) era on the 8th century. Based on the palaeography and Rock-cut architecture, P.R. Srinivasan has placed it at 8th century. Most of the historians have compared the temples with similar architectural elements found in Badami Caves (6th century) and a possible influence. Some historians have argued that the Azhwars during the Bhakti tradition have discarded Rock-cut images and hence no mention is found in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham about this temple. But the argument is disproved by other historians who have quoted rock-cut temples like Thirumeyyam in Pudukottai district and Ninra Narayana Perumal temple in Virudhunagar district finding mention in the canon. The records of the details of the inscriptions are found in the Annual report of Epigraphy -1961. There are no inscriptions in the temple, but an undated inscription in the Ranganatha temple, which is on the upper cave in the hill. Historians believe it is possible that both the temples were built during the same period. Architecture The Namakkal Anjaneyar Temple facing the Narasimhaswamy temple The temple is located along Namakkal-Salem road in Namakkal town, Namakkal district in Tamil Nadu. The temple carved out of an imposing hill, is located in the downhill of the Namakkal Fort, on the western flank of the hill. The temple has a flat gateway tower and a second entrance, also with a flat gateway leading to the pillared halls. The main sanctum sanctorum houses the image of Lord Narasimha in sitting posture, called Asanamurthi with two images under his feet. The sanctum is rock-cut and square in shape with a black background. The sanctum has three sculpted cells, two pillars and a verandah in front of it. The image of Narasimhar is treated as a Yogasana image, with the images under his feet seen to be the Sun and the Moon. It is not called a Bhogasana as the consorts on either side of him are absent. He has Shiva and Brahma on his either sides and he is sported with two hands holding the conch and the chakra. There is a panel depicting the narrative of Varaha avatar of Vishnu, who takes water from Bali and later grows big as Trivikrama to submerge Bali under his feet as per the Skanda Purana. Historians consider this as a deviation from the monoscenic sculptures in temples of Kanchipuram and Mahabalipuram. The temple has other sculptural relief on the walls of the temple depicting Trivikrama, Narasimha slaying Hiranyakasipu and Ananta sayana Vishnu. The temple tank, Kamalalayam, is located outside the temple. There are similar rock-cut images in the temple halfway up the Namakkal Fort.. Of note, it was in front of Namagiri Narashimhar that Saint Purandaradasa composed his famous song \\"Simha Rupanada Sri Hari, Namagirishane\\". The temple complex houses two other sanctums. These sanctums house Namagiri Tayar and Sri Lakshmi Narayana. Goddess Namagiri Lakshmi fondly called as Namagiri Tayar was the family Goddess of the renowned Mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. Ramanujan credited his acumen to his family goddess, Mahalakshmi of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work, and claimed to dream of blood drops that symbolised her male consort, Narasimha, after which he would receive visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes. He often said, \\"An equation for me has no meaning, unless it represents a thought of God.\\" There are number of sacred bathing places or thirthams in hollows in the sides of the rock and the largest of them is called \\"Kamalalayam\\" which is sacred to Lakshmi. Festival and religious practises Sculpted pillared halls leading to the cave sanctum The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasandhi at 7:00 a.m., Uchikala poojai at 12:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 4:30 p.m., and Arthajama Pooja at 7:45 p.m.Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for the presiding deities. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 7:00 am ‚Äì 1:00 pm and 4:30 - 8:00 pm and The Great Hanuman Temple is open Morning 6.30 am to 1.00 pm. and Evening 4.30 pm to 9.00 pm. on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings. The major festivals of the temple is the fifteen day Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April) when the image of presiding deities are taken around the streets of the temple in a temple chariot. The sacred marriage of the presiding deity is also performed during the function. Other festivals of the temple include Chittirai Tamil New year, Vaigasi Visagam, Telugu New Year, Avani Pavitrotsavam, Narasimhar Jayanthi, Vaikunta Ekadasi and Thai Pongal during various months of the year. In modern times, the Namakkal district administration has identified the temple as one of the prominent tourist attractions in the district. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

He is best remembered in Burmese history for the poem he wrote for King Sithu II, just a few minutes before his execution, titled The Law of Nature. The extant poem, likely a result of a 14th-century update, is considered to be the first known instance of poetry in Burmese as well as monarchical criticism. Brief The future minister, whose personal name is lost to history, began his career as a royal attendant at the palace of King Sithu I (r. 1112‚Äì67) in Pagan (Bagan). Descended from a line of royal attendants,MSK Vol. 9 1975: 166 he attended to the children of Prince Narathu, including Naratheinkha and Sithu II.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 316 He was a tutor to Naratheinkha.Harvey 1925: 54 The attendant entered the upper echelons of power in 1151 when the king promoted him to serve as a royal adviser/minister (amat ()), with the title of Ananda Thuriya.Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 118‚Äì119 The appointment certainly was not a routine matter as ministers of the day were usually drawn from more distant branches of the royal family.Aung-Thwin 1985: 130‚Äì131 Royal chronicles say that Crown Prince Min Shin Saw vigorously opposed the appointment because of the attendant's commoner origins.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 202), (Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 118‚Äì119) and (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 303): Sithu I permitted Ananda Thuriya to wear an attire reserved for senior princes; when the crown prince saw Ananda Thuriya in the princely attire, the prince forced the commoner to change the attire right away; and when the king heard of what happened, a heated argument began between the king and the crown prince, which eventually led to the exile of the crown prince to the north. He may have also viewed Ananda Thuriya as too close to his younger brother and rival Narathu. At any rate, Min Shin Saw lost the power struggle, and was exiled.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 303 In the following years, Narathu became the de facto heir-apparent, and Ananda Thuriya's career continued to rise alongside his patron's.Hmannan Vol. 2003: 304 He became a senior minister in 1167 after Narathu had seized the throne by assassinating both Sithu I and Min Shin Saw. Ananda Thuriya continued to serve in the role when Narathu's eldest son and his former pupil Naratheinkha became king in 1171. In 1174, Ananda Thuriya became ensnared in a power struggle between Naratheinkha and his younger brother Crown Prince Narapati. Chronicles say that the king tried to remove the crown prince because he coveted his brother's \\"exotically beautiful\\" consort Weluwaddy. The younger brother, who was commander-in-chief of the army, learned of the plan, and instead had the elder brother assassinated, and seized the throne.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 313‚Äì315 The younger brother, now King Sithu II, considered Ananda Thuriya too close to his brother, and ordered the execution of the aged courtier. At the execution site, Ananda Thuriya wrote a four-stanza poem to be presented to the king, titled The Law of Nature, which was written only a few minutes before his execution. Sithu II pardoned the minister immediately after having read the poem. But it was too late: he was informed that the old minister had already been executed.

Rising along the Calapooya Divide near the border between Lane and Douglas counties, it flows generally west-northwest to meet the Big River. The combined Big and Little rivers form the Coast Fork near Black Butte. The butte is a dark-colored mountain, the site of a former mine, and the site of a former post office. On older maps, Little River appears as a tributary of Garoutte Creek, also known as Saroutte Creek. However, in 1988 the United States Board on Geographic Names renamed the lower reach of Garoutte Creek so that it became part of Little River. The upper reach of Garoutte Creek thus became a tributary of Little River. Named tributaries of Little River from source to mouth are Weyerhaeuser Creek, which enters from the right; Cinnabar Creek, left; Trail Creek, right; Garoutte and Blood creeks, left; and Dennis Creek, right. Post office The Black Butte Mine, developed by S. P. Garoutte in the 1890s, led to the establishment of a post office at Black Butte. William Harris was the first postmaster, and the office, established in 1898, was known by his last name, Harris. The name was changed in 1901 to Blackbutte. It operated under that name until permanently closing in 1957. Pollution In the 21st century, the former mine and the area around it have become a Superfund site.

Education and professional career  He went to primary and secondary school in Cizre and graduated from Dicle University in 1991. In 1993 he was a lawyer in Cizre, and a member of the Cizre Bar Association and defending people against the Turkish state at the European Commission of Human Rights (ECHR). In November 1993 he was detained and on the 10 December 1993 he was remanded to prison accused of links with the Kurdistan Workers' Party's armed wing. He was released from custody on 17 February 1994 together with other defendants. Between 1996 and 2006 he was active at the Diyarbakir Bar association as a manager and in 2012 he was elected its chairman. On 23 March 2014, he was the lawyer in the Ku≈ükonar massacre case in the ECHR, in which Turkey was condemned for massacring Kurdish civilians and blaming the PKK. El√ßi was detained several times and received death threats after saying the banned PKK should not be regarded as a terrorist organization. In October 2015, El√ßi was detained by Turkish authorities and accused of disseminating \\"terrorist propaganda\\" after having said in an interview with CNN T√ºrk, that the PKK was not a terrorist organization.  Death  He was killed in the Sur district of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey on 28 November 2015. He was shot during a shootout between police and members of the Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement (YDG-H), the PKK's youth wing, following a press statement during which he had been calling for an end to violence between the PKK and the Turkish state. Two members of the YDG-H shot and killed two police officers and fled down the Yenikapƒ± street, where Tahir El√ßi was holding the press conference beside the \\"Four- legged Minaret\\" of the Sheikh Matar Mosque.

Investigation of Tahir El√ßi's killing  Turkish authorities didn't conduct a full investigation.

Biography ‚ÄòUlayya was one of the daughters of the third Abbasid Caliph al-Mahdi bi-'llah (r. 775‚Äì85), who reigned from 775 to his death in 785, and was noted for promoting poetry and music in his realm. Her mother was a singer and concubine called Makn≈´na (herself the jƒÅriya of one al-MarwƒÅnƒ´ya). It appears that, with her father dying early in her life, ‚ÄòUlayya was brought up by her half-brother Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-809). ‚ÄòUlayya was a princess, and, like her half-brother Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi (779‚Äì839), a noted musician, and poet. It has been claimed that she surpassed her brother in skills and while 'not the only princess known to have composed poetry and songs', nonetheless 'the most gifted'. 'Much of her poetry consists of short pieces designed to be sung; in the mu·∏•dath style, it treats of love, friendship and longing for home, but also includes praise of HƒÅr≈´n, the caliph, celebration of wine and sharp attacks on enemies.' The main source for ‚ÄòUlayya's life is the tenth-century KitƒÅb al-AghƒÅnƒ´ of Ab≈´ ‚Äôl-Faraj al- I·π£fahƒÅnƒ´.al-I·π£fahƒ´nƒ´, Abu l-Faraj, KitƒÅb al-aghƒÅnƒ´, DƒÅr al-Fikr, 21 parts and Index in 9 vols., equivalent to the edition Kairo 1322/1905‚Äì5. This and other sources tend to portray ‚ÄòUlayya as an accomplished woman who could readily hold her own in court society, but who tended to shy from too prominent a role in public life. She was wealthy and clearly possessed slave-girls, and had an intimate relationship with her powerful brothers; although there is little evidence of her communing with religious scholars, 'various reports in ‚ÄòUlayya's tarƒÅjim refer to her piety and adherence to ritual obligations'. ‚ÄòUlayya was married to an ‚ÄòAbbƒÅsid prince, but 'love-poems of her addressed to two slaves have been preserved'. One of the best known anecdotes about her concerns > her relationship with a member of al-Rashƒ´d's palace staff, a khƒÅdim named > ·π¨all, with whom she would correspond in verse. When al-Rashƒ´d forbids her > from uttering his name, she follows his order to the letter even when it > precludes her from uttering a line of S≈´rat al-Baqara in which the term ·π≠all > occurs. When the caliph learns of this, he is swayed and presents ·π¨all to > her as a gift. In this case, her piety become the means to winning a quite > worldly reward. Marriage Ulayya married Musa ibn Isa, a prominent member of a cadet branch of the Abbasid dynasty. He had an extended relation with Abbasid dynasty, Musa was a great-nephew of its first two caliphs al-Saffah () and al-Mansur (); he was also connected to the ruling line by his marriage to Ulayya, daughter of the third caliph al-Mahdi.; . Poetry As example of ‚ÄòUlayya's poetry is: ::I held back my love's name and kept repeating it to myself. ::Oh how I long for an empty space to call out the name I love.Abdullah al-Udhari, Classical Poems by Arab Women (London: Saqi, 1999), p. 110.

He collected 50,000 specimens and produced 7,500 photographs and moving images of nature subjects. At his death, his collection of bird and mammal specimens was the largest private collection in the United States.  Biography  Donald Ryder Dickey was born on March 31, 1887 in Dubuque, Iowa, the son of Anna Roberts Ryder and Ernest May Dickey (superintendent of the Diamond Joe Steamship Line). In 1902, Dickey and his mother, also an avid naturalist, joined a Sierra Club group hiking King's River Ca√±on and climbing Mount Whitney. Others on this trip included John Muir, C. Hart Merriam, Dr. Henry Gannett, historian Theodore Hittell and landscape artist William Keith. Dickey entered the University of California in 1906, but received his B.A. degree (with honors) from Yale University in 1910. His collegiate society memberships included Psi Upsilon, Elihu, and Phi Beta Kappa. He was active in music societies (the University and Apollo Glee Clubs and the College Choir) and was captain of the University Gun Team. During his senior year at Yale, Dickey suffered severe heart failure; he slowly recovered his health during a three-year convalescence, living for a time first in Ojai and later at his parents' home in Pasadena. Dickey married Florence Van Vechten on June 15, 1921, and became active in community and business affairs, serving as a trustee of the Southwest Museum, Los Angeles (1920‚Äì1928), and President of the Board of Pasadena Hospital (1924‚Äì1925), and as a director of the Pasadena branch of the Pacific Southwest Trust & Savings Bank (1924‚Äì29).  Field research  Upon recovering his health, Dickey began to pursue his interests in natural history by photographing and collecting birds and small mammals. He ultimately determined upon a goal of establishing a major research collection on Southern California fauna. Dickey's field investigations included a 1915 expedition to San Clemente Island, seven summers in Canada, the 1923 Smithsonian-sponsored Tanager Expedition to Laysan Island in Hawaii to study the seabird rookeries there, and trips to Baja California, northern Michigan, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and El Salvador. Among his field assistants and collaborators were Adriaan Joseph van Rossem, Laurence M. Huey, Ruben Arthur Stirton and George A. Stirton, William Henry Burt, Henry Hargrave Sheldon, and John Zoeger. In 1925, he was awarded an honorary M.A. from Occidental College, and from 1926, he was Research Associate in Vertebrate Zoology at the California Institute of Technology. His professional memberships included the American Ornithologists' Union, the Cooper Ornithological Society (of which he was a governor from 1926 until his death) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Dickey was posthumously awarded the 1941 William Brewster Memorial Award by the American Ornithologists' Union, sharing the honor with A.J. van Rossem in recognition of their 1938 monograph \\"Birds of El Salvador.\\" Dickey's research collection of bird and mammal specimens and still photographs and moving images ultimately comprised 50,0000 specimens, 10,000 natural history books and papers, and 7,500 photographs. In 1926, Caltech provided Throop Hall to house the growing collection. In 1940, Dickey's widow donated the collection to the University of California, Los Angeles. Dickey died on April 15, 1932 in Pasadena, California.  Photography  Dickey's nature photography, in both still and motion picture work, was extensive and widely admired. His photographs are reprinted in The Birds of California by William Leon Dawson (1873‚Äì1928) and Life Histories of North American Birds by Arthur Cleveland Bent (1866‚Äì1954).

The location of the archaeological site is indicated by a star; the location of Kavousi Kastro is indicated by a circle. It is situated in the northern foothills of the Thripti Mountains overlooking the Gulf of Mirabello, at an elevation of 427 m above sea level. The ancient name of the site is unknown. \\"Vronda\\" (\\"Thunder Hill\\"), as it was called by the pioneering archaeologist Harriet Boyd [Hawes] at the beginning of the 20th century,Boyd 1901, p. 131. is a local toponym; the entire ridge and surrounding area are also referred to as \\"Xerambela\\" (\\"Dry Vineyards\\"; ).Day, Klein, and Turner 2009, p. 3; Day et al. 2016, p. 3. Most of the visible remains on the site belong to a \\"Dark Age\\" settlementMcEnroe 2010, pp. 147‚Äì150, 154‚Äì159; Wallace 2010, pp. 104‚Äì126; Day et al. 2016. dating to the Late Minoan IIIC period (c. 1170‚Äì1050 BCE) and a slightly later, Early Iron Age cemetery (c. 1050‚Äì675 BCE).Day 2011; Day et al. 2016, pp. 209‚Äì213. History of the site View of Kavousi Vronda from the south (2001), with the island of Pseira in the distance. Investigations by the Kavousi Project have recovered evidence of human activity on the Vronda ridge as early as the Final Neolithic period (4th millennium BCE) and continuing, with interruptions, through the end of the Bronze Age (3rd and 2nd millennia BCE) and transition to the Iron Age (1st millennium BCE). Later remains attest to limited occupation and use of the site during the Venetian (13th‚Äì17th centuries C.E.), Ottoman (17th‚Äì19th centuries C.E.) and even Modern (early 20th century C.E) periods.Day, Klein and Turner 2009, pp. 2‚Äì8; Day et al. 2016, pp. 195‚Äì231. * The earliest traces of human activity at the site date to the Final Neolithic period, and consist of two stone celts and several fragments of pottery. Although not found in primary contexts or undisturbed strata, the amount of pottery suggests some type of small-scale habitation (e.g., a farmhouse, 1-2 isolated dwellings, etc.) at Vronda during this period.Day et al. 2016, p. 199; cf. Haggis 2005, p. 62. * Occupation of the site during the Prepalatial (Early Minoan I-II) and Late Prepalatial (Early Minoan III‚ÄìMiddle Minoan IA) periods is attested primarily by substantial amounts of ceramic material deposited as fill during the construction of later buildings. Although no architectural remains are preserved from the Prepalatial period, the types and quantities of ceramic vessels suggest that feasting and drinking rituals may have taken place at the site in Early Minoan II. Petrographic analysis indicates that the some of the pottery was not produced locally, but may have come from the western Isthmus of Ierapetra, demonstrating that the Prepalatial inhabitants of Vronda participated in a wide network of exchange with other sites in eastern Crete. Far less diagnostic material that could be assigned to the Early Minoan III‚ÄìMiddle Minoan IA period was recovered; this may indicate a major change in the size and nature of the settlement, perhaps related to a restructuring of settlements and a disbursement of population to smaller sites in the area.Day et al. 2016, pp. 199‚Äì201; cf. Haggis 2005, p. 65. * The earliest preserved architectural remains date to the Protopalatial period (Middle Minoan IB‚ÄìMiddle Minoan IIB), when a substantial building (Building P) was constructed on the eastern side of the summit; a Minoan kernos (or cupule stone - a flat slab with multiple small, round depressions arranged in a circular or oval pattern) found in a partially paved courtyard nearby to the south may date from the same era.Day, Klein, and Turner 2009, pp. 65‚Äì77; Day et al. 2016, pp. 3‚Äì6, 201‚Äì203. Ceramic remains associated with Building P suggest elite feasting and drinking activities, while a clay nodulus (a token made from a small lump of clay with a decorative impression on one side) implies some type of administrative function.Day, Klein and Turner 2009, p. 67; Day et al. 2016, pp. 201‚Äì203. Evidence for other Protopalatial structures consists of a fragmentary wall on the eastern slope and several deposits of pottery used in later fills on the summit, the southeast slope, and the west slope.Day, Klein, and Turner 2009, pp. 74‚Äì75; Day and Glowacki 2012, pp. 2, 45; Day et al. 2016, pp. 201‚Äì203. * Evidence for occupation during the Neopalatial period (Middle Minoan III‚ÄìLate Minoan I) consists of only a few walls and a pit on the summit, and substantial deposits of Neopalatial pottery used in later leveling fills.Day, Klein, and Turner 2009, pp. 59‚Äì63; Day et al. 2016, pp. 203‚Äì204. The site apparently went out of use at the end of the Neopalatial period (Late Minoan IB); most of the architecture may have been dismantled or destroyed when the site was re-inhabited in the Late Minoan IIIC period. Day et al. 2016, pp. 204‚Äì205. * In the Late Minoan IIIC period, the site was occupied by a small settlement covering an area of at least 0.50 hectares.Day, Klein, and Turner 2009; Day and Glowacki 2012; Day et al. 2016. Established only slightly later in time than either the Late Minoan IIIC habitation at nearby Kavousi Kastro or the much larger settlement at Karphi above the Lasithi Plateau, the Vronda settlement eventually consisted of about 20 houses, a large building on the summit that may have been the home of the community leader and a place for ritual feasting and drinking ceremonies (Building A-B), a freestanding temple or shrine of the \\"Goddess with Upraised Arms\\" (Greek: Œ∏ŒµŒ¨ ŒºŒµŒ∏‚Äô œÖœàœâŒºŒ≠ŒΩœâŒΩ œáŒµŒπœÅœéŒΩ) (Building G), and a kiln.Day and Snyder 2004; Gesell 2004; Glowacki 2004; Klein 2004; Glowacki 2007; Day, Klein, and Turner 2009; McEnroe 2010, pp. 147‚Äì150, 154‚Äì159; Wallace 2010, pp.104‚Äì126, 127‚Äì135; Glowacki and Klein 2011; Day and Glowacki 2012; Day et al. 2016; Gaignerot-Driessen 2016, pp. 383‚Äì397. The settlement may have been used for four generations (or around 120 years) before it was abandoned at the very end of the Late Minoan IIIC period. Although it is unknown why the inhabitants left or where they went, it is likely that at least some of them moved up to the higher settlement at Kavousi Kastro, which seems to have become the dominant site in the Kavousi region from the 11th through the 8th centuries BCE.Day 2011, p. 749‚Äì750; Day et al. 2016, pp. 208‚Äì209. * The abandoned settlement was subsequently used as a burial ground, possibly by the descendants of the original villagers in an attempt to maintain group identity or legitimize territorial claims based on ancestry. During the Subminoan (11th century BCE), Protogeometric (10th century BCE), and early Geometric periods (9th century BCE), inhumation burials were placed in small, stone-built, corbelled tholos tombs, generally located at the northern and northwestern edges of the former settlement. Eleven tholos tombs (designated Vronda I‚ÄìXI) are known, but only two (Vronda IV and IX) were found unrobbed. In the Late Geometric (8th century BCE) and Early Orientalizing (7th century BCE) periods, cremation burials were placed in stone-built enclosures (cist graves), often within the rooms of the long-abandoned and partially collapsed houses of the Late Minoan IIIC settlement. Approximately 30 cist graves were discovered by the Kavousi Project. Evidence suggests that the cremations took place on a pyre built within each enclosure and the cremated remains were left in situ. Since the graves were used on multiple occasions for men, women, and children (including infants and fetuses), they most likely represent family burial spaces. The cemetery at Vronda went out of use completely in the Early Orientalizing period.Liston 2007; Day 2011; Day et al. 2016, pp. 209‚Äì2011; Gaignerot-Driessen 2016, pp. 389‚Äì397. * The site seems to have been largely uninhabited from the 7th century BCE until the Venetian period (13th‚Äì17th century CE), when small buildings were constructed on the summit (Building R) and southern slope (Building F). From the same period is a partially excavated building (\\"Xerambela farmstead\\") with associated alonia (circular threshing floors) some 200 meters to the north of the Vronda summit. Later periods are represented only by few ceramic remains or miscellaneous artifacts.Day, Klein and Turner 2009, pp. 2‚Äì8; Day et al. 2016, pp. 211‚Äì213. Archaeological research The Kavousi area as seen from the harbor of the Minoan settlement on Pseira island (from north). The location of Kavousi Vronda is indicated by a star; the location of Kavousi Kastro is indicated by a circle (2000). The site was initially explored by the American archaeologist Harriet Boyd [Hawes] in 1900, \\"as representative of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens to excavate in the name of the Cretan Government.\\"Boyd 1901 Boyd uncovered a large \\"house\\" with storerooms (now designated Building A-B) on the summit, an \\"excellent stretch of wall\\"Boyd 1901, p. 131 (now called the East Terrace Wall), and eight small tholos tombs (now labeled Vronda I‚ÄìVIII) on the north and northwest sides of the ridges. Another tholos tomb (now designated Vronda IX) was discovered in 1951 by a local landowner, George Sekadakis, who deposited the antiquities with the local authorities.Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1983, p. 393; Day, Klein, and Turner 2009, p. 3 Archaeological investigations were resumed in 1974 by Geraldine C. Gesell (University of Tennessee) and Leslie Preston Day (College of Wooster; later, Wabash College), who visited Vronda as part of an informal survey of sites in the area.Day, Klein, and Turner 2009, p. 3 In 1978, Gesell and Day were joined by William D.E. Coulson (University of Minnesota; later, American School of Classical Studies at Athens) to establish the Kavousi Project, which began with mapping of the site, a study of material found by Boyd and Sekadakis and housed in the Herakleion Archaeological Museum and the Archaeological Collection of Ierapetra (1979), cleaning of the tholos tombs (1981), a topographical plan, cleaning and drawing of architectural remains on the Vronda ridge (1983‚Äì1984), and two study seasons (1985‚Äì1986). Full-scale excavations under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the 24th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of the Greek Archaeological Service, and with permission from the Greek Ministry of Culture, were conducted from 1987‚Äì1990 and in 1992, followed by site conservation from 1993 to 1996, and study from 1990 to 2003.Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1983; Day, Klein, and Turner 2009, p. 3 Today, select antiquities discovered by the Kavousi Project at Vronda are on display in the Archaeological Museum of Agios Nikolaos and in the Archaeological Collection of Ierapetra. Other artifacts, excavation notebooks, and original drawings and plans, are housed in the Institute for Aegean Prehistory Study Center for East Crete (INSTAP-SCEC) in Pacheia Ammos in eastern Crete, Greece.

Before completion, the ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy and renamed HMCS Kincardine, which used the corvette as a convoy escort for the rest of the war. Following the war, the ship was sold for mercantile use to French, then Moroccan interests and was renamed Saada in 1947. Design and description The Castle class were an improved corvette design over their predecessor . The Flower class was not considered acceptable for mid-Atlantic sailing and was only used on Atlantic convoy duty out of need. Though the Admiralty would have preferred s, the inability of many small shipyards to construct the larger ships required them to come up with a smaller vessel. The increased length of the Castle class over their predecessorsChesneau, p.63 and their improved hull form gave the Castles better speed and performance on patrol in the North Atlantic and an acceptable replacement for the Flowers.Brown 2007, p.142 This, coupled with improved anti-submarine armament in the form of the Squid mortar led to a much more capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel. However, the design did have criticisms, mainly in the way it handled at low speeds and that the class's maximum speed was already slower than the speeds of the new U-boats they would be facing.Brown 2007, p.127 A Castle-class corvette was long with a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Brown states the beam at and the draught at The ships displaced standard and deep load.Chesneau states the displacement at deep load as The ships had a complement of 120.Brown states the complement as 99 and Johnston states the complement of Canadian ships at 112 (7 officers and 105 ratings). The ships were powered by two Admiralty three-drum boilers which created . This powered one vertical triple expansion engine that drove one shaft, giving the ships a maximum speed of . The ships carried 480 tons of oil giving them a range of at . The corvettes were armed with one QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun mounted forward.Mk XIX = Mark 19. Britain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II. This was the nineteenth model of British QF 4-inch gun Anti-air armament varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.Brown 2007, p.126 For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rail on the stern that came with 15 depth charges. The ships were equipped with Type 145 and Type 147B ASDIC. The Type 147B was tied to the Squid anti-submarine mortar and would automatically set the depth on the fuses of the projectiles until the moment of firing. A single Squid-launched attack had a success rate of 25%.Brown 2012, p.129 The class was also provided with HF/DF and Type 277 radar. Service history Bell from the ship Flag from HMCS Kincardine, on display inside the Royal Canadian Legion hall in Kincardine, Ontario Tamworth Castle, named for the castle in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was ordered on 19 January 1943. The keel was laid on 25 August 1943 by Smiths Dock Company at their shipyard in South Bank-on-Tees.Macpherson and Barrie, p.164 At some point in 1943, the ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian NavyColledge, p.346 and was launched on 26 January 1944. The corvette was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 19 June 1944 at Middlesbrough as HMCS Kincardine, named for the town in Ontario that sits on shores of Lake Huron, with the pennant number K490. Kincardine worked up at Tobermory before joining the Mid- Ocean Escort Force escort group C-2 in August 1944. However, not long after joining, the ship had to return to Smiths Dock for repairs and was not available for service until mid-September. The corvette was deployed only as a local escort until 2 October when Kincardine joined a trans-Atlantic convoy as escort. Kincardine remained as an ocean convoy escort for the rest of the war. Kincardine returned to Canada in June 1945, where in July, she was temporarily used as a training ship attached to . The corvette then underwent a refit at Liverpool, Nova Scotia and was placed in reserve at Halifax in October. Kincardine was paid off at Halifax on 27 February 1946, and sold to the French Government on 5 September 1946. They resold the ex-corvette to Moroccan interests in 1947 who renamed her Saada.Macpherson and Barrie state that it was this ship that was sold to the Burmese Navy and renamed Van Myo Aung in 1958. However, it was , whose original name was Kincardine before her transfer to the Royal Navy, that was sold to Burma. The merchant ship, which had a gross register tonnage of 1,516 tons, was owned by Les Cargos Fruitiers Cherifiens SA and had her port of registry in Casablanca. Saada was broken up at La Spezia, Italy on 15 September 1953.

It is found in the Savannah, Ogeechee and Altamaha catchment areas in South Carolina and Georgia. It is a small but colorful fish, typically less than in total length, with blackish, red and green streaks on its flanks. Green and red are associated with Christmas, hence the common name Christmas darter. Like other darters, it lives on or close to the stream-bed, in riffles and vegetation-laden stretches of small rivers, creeks and spring-fed streams. It feeds on aquatic insects and probably breeds in the spring, but its biology and behavior are poorly known. The Christmas darter is closely related to the Savannah darter and the Christmas Eve or Hannukah darter, the latter of which is sometimes considered a subspecies of the Christmas darter rather than a species in its own right. The Christmas darter may hybridize with other darter species, though hybridization is hampered by behavioral and biological barriers. The Christmas darter is a common species in suitable habitat and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as being of least concern for conservation purposes. In South Carolina, it is considered a conservation priority species, as it may be threatened in future by impoundment of rivers, siltation and deforestation. Taxonomy The Christmas darter was described as a new species in 1945 by Henry Weed Fowler, who gave it the scientific name Poecilichthys hopkinsi. He suggested the common name of \\"Hopkin's darter\\". The holotype was collected by Milton Hopkins, after whom the species was named. It was collected in Oswitchee Springs in Wilcox County, Georgia in 1942. Poecilichthys has since been recognized as a junior synonym of Etheostoma, and the species was reclassified as E. hopkinsi. Its common name of \\"Christmas darter\\" is due to the red and green stripes on its body. Some authors have considered the Christmas darter to consist of two subspecies: E. h. hopkinsi (the Christmas darter) and E. h. binotatum (the Christmas Eve or Hannukah darter). However, the Christmas Eve darter, as E. binotatum, is sometimes identified as a full species rather than a subspecies, such as by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Conversely, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System does not recognize the Christmas Eve darter as either a full species or a subspecies (the Christmas darter is considered monotypic). The Christmas darter was traditionally considered part of the Oligocephalus subgenus, though a 2011 study found that the subgenus as defined was paraphyletic (did not contain all descendants of a common ancestor). In a phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, the Christmas darter formed a clade with the Christmas Eve darter (E. h. binotatum or E. binotatum) and the Savannah darter (E. fricksium), the latter of which was its sister taxon. Description Darters have cylindrical bodies, large paired fins and poorly developed swim bladders; they rest on the substrate and use their pectoral fins for lift when swimming. The Christmas darter has a maximum total length of but a more typical length is . The dorsal fin (back fin) has 10 or 11 spines and 11 to 13 soft rays, the pectoral fin has 12 to 13 rays and the anal fin has 2 spines and 7 to 9 rays. The general color is some shade of yellowish-green, with eight dark dorsal saddles. The flanks have ten to twelve dark bars that turn green or blueish-green in breeding males. These are separated by reddish streaks in mature males and by yellow or orangish streaks in females. The front dorsal fin is a dusky green color, apart from the central portion, which has a broad red stripe in males and a narrow red line in females. The caudal peduncle (end of fish's body where tail fin attaches) has a row of four, somewhat irregular, dark spots. During the breeding season, adult males change color. The breeding male's dorsal fin has a band each of red and blue along the edge. The breeding males are overall more colorful. The Christmas Eve darter is distinguishable from the Christmas darter by the presence of two dark, rectangular blotches near the top of its head. These blotches are either absent or faint in the Christmas darter. Additionally, the Christmas Eve darter and the Christmas darter differ in their number of lateral scales. The Christmas Eve darter has 41-49 scales, the last 8-13 of which lack pores, while the Christmas darter has 40-47 scales, the last 2-11 of which lack pores. The Christmas darter can be separated from other members of its genus by a combination of the following traits; the lateral line (sensory organ along each side of the body) is straight; the branchiostegal membranes (structural membranes of the gill) on the gills are moderately connected; a frenum (membrane that attaches the upper lip to the snout) is attached to the upper lip; there are two spines on the anal fin. The Christmas darter is most frequently confused with the Savannah darter, based on the similarities in their appearance and the overlap in their ranges. The Savannah darter differs in having a pale stripe running along the spine and in having dorso-lateral dark streaks rather than dark dorsal saddles. The red stripes on the spinous dorsal fin is at the margin of the fin in the Savannah darter but in the middle in the Christmas darter. Distribution and habitat The Altamaha River in Georgia The Christmas darter is endemic to the states of Georgia and South Carolina in the southeastern United States. The nominate population is restricted to the Altamaha and Ogeechee River drainage basins in Georgia, both above and below the fall line, while the Christmas Eve darter occurs in the Savannah River catchment area, on the border between Georgia and South Carolina. Typical habitats include medium-sized and small rivers and creeks, riffles with rubble and coarse substrates, headwater creeks, and spring-fed streams with plentiful vegetation and sandy bottoms. Biology and ecology The Christmas darter's biology is largely unknown. It likely reproduces in March and April. Individuals become sexually mature by the end of their first year of life and have a maximum lifespan of two years. Its diet consists primarily of aquatic insects, though also includes other aquatic invertebrates. It can hybridize with other darter species, though a hybridization study with it and the redband darter (E. luteovinctum) showed variation in hybrid inviability. Hybrid offspring from a Christmas darter female were often severely deformed, dying before hatching. The hybrid offspring of redband darter females had much higher likelihoods of successfully hatching. The major barrier to hybridization, however, is behavioral isolation, meaning that the Christmas darter has a strong preference for mating with members of its own species rather than hybridizing. Status The Christmas darter is a common species and does not seem to be facing any particular threats. It occurs in numerous locations in the watersheds it occupies, and there is no reason to suspect that the overall population is decreasing. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as \\"least concern\\". As of 2015, it is considered a priority species in the state of South Carolina, along with 56 other freshwater fish. Priority species were species that were not benefitting from federal conservation funding already, those rare or at-risk, those little known to science, or those that could be used as bioindicators. Though many of the listed species of freshwater fish were noted to not be in danger of extinction, their inclusion was justified \\"if the goal is to maintain South Carolina's rich and diverse fish fauna\\". Though not presently threatened with extinction, alteration of the watersheds it lives in could seriously reduce its range in the future. Threats to the species could include deforestation, siltation and dams.

One United Nations peacekeeper from Chad was killed, as were two Malian children killed when a shell fell on a nearby camp of Tuareg and Arab nomads, according to the UN. Eleven more peacekeepers and three more civilians were reportedly injured. The rockets and shells were apparently launched from both the north and the south of the base. It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack, but Islamist militants active in the area or Tuareg separatists were suspected. Background Kidal, where the attack took place, is considered the \\"cradle\\" of the Tuareg separatist movement, which seeks to carve out an ethnic homeland called Azawad in northern Mali. Separatists briefly seized control of major cities in the region and declared Azawadi independence in 2012, but their Islamist allies turned on them and evicted them from their strongholds. Months later, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad agreed to support Malian territorial unity and renounce the independence of Azawad, although the relationship between Tuareg fighters in the north and the Malian military remained tenuous. France, the former colonial power in Mali, intervened in 2013 to drive out Islamist fighters. The United Nations began taking over peacekeeping duties from French troops in northern Mali later that year, forming MINUSMA as its mission in the West African country. The day before the rocket attack in Kidal, a gunman opened fire in a bar in Bamako, Mali's capital. The attack killed five, including a Belgian security official working for the European Union. The Islamist group Al-Murabitoun claimed responsibility for the attack, the first of its kind in the southern Malian city. Reactions The United Nations Security Council and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack as \\"intolerable\\" and said it violated international law.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. Synopsis Numbers for 1975 were very similar to 1974, in terms of number of tornadoes, but not the number of fatalities; however, there were over 1,100 injuries related to tornadoes. Events January 52 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in January. January 9‚Äì12 Between January 9th and 12th, 1975 a panhandle hook cyclone produced tornadoes in the Southeast, including an F4 tornado that hit McComb, Mississippi killing 9 people. It is one of the largest January tornado outbreaks. Aside the tornadoes, the cyclone dumped at least 27\\" of snow in Riverton, Minnesota. In Willmar, Minnesota, 168 passengers were trapped in a stranded train because they couldn't walk to shelter due to wind chill values. February 45 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in February. February 22‚Äì24 A small outbreak of tornadoes impacted the Dixie Alley region, including an F4 tornado that hit Tuscaloosa, Alabama killing 1 person. An F2 tornado hit Altus, Oklahoma, killing 2 people. March 84 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in March. April 108 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in April. April 23‚Äì24 Three F4 tornadoes touched down in Missouri, the deadliest being an F4 striking Neosho, Missouri. More tornadoes touched down associated with this outbreak. May 188 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in May. May 6 An F4 tornado touched down in Sarpy County, Nebraska, with a path extending to Omaha. Damage estimates ranged from $250 million to $500 million. The number of homes destroyed was 287 with damage to 1400 others. The time of day aided in the warning process as a spotter saw the tornado in Sarpy County during the daylight hours and children were no longer in school. The NWS aided by REACT and Civil Defense systems provided good lead time for the residents of Douglas County, Nebraska. Three people did perish. An elderly woman died in her home and likely did not hear the warnings. A waitress was killed in a restaurant as she huddled with others in the restroom. A man was killed while seeking shelter at a gas station. June 196 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in June. July 79 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in July. July 23 A tornado which slashed through a three-block downtown area of the city killed three people. At least 55 others were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized. The twister's winds were so forceful that a 15-foot wooden plank was driven through an auto engine block, splitting the front of the car in two. The twister hit this central Illinois community of 15,000 during the early evening and decimated the business district, severed electrical power and gas lines, and sheared off roofs and uprooted scores of trees. It also overturned numerous automobiles and blew out hundreds of windows. Initial reports from the Illinois State Police placed the number of dead at four, but a spokesman said, \\"Early confusion probably accounted for duplicated reports.\\" The area hit by the tornado included city square and another block farther south, and also caused extensive damage elsewhere. August 60 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in August. September 34 tornadoes were reported in the U.S in September. October 12 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in October. November 39 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in November. November 9‚Äì10 A minor two-day tornado outbreak swept across Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana.

History  Although little solid historical information exists about Casa de los Coroneles, it is believed it was constructed in 1740, under the authority of Colonel Melchor de Cabrera Bethencourt.  Construction style  Casa de los Coroneles was built in a Canarian-Andalusian style. On its imposing northern facade there are eight windows on the ground floor and eight more on the upper level. In keeping with traditional Canarian architecture, each upper window has a wooden balcony. Built in the 18th Century, when many of the island's residents would not have had a single window in their dwellings, the sight of the sixteen on the main facade of the manor would have been a statement of the authority and wealth of those who resided within. Many features of the home are designed to send out a message of power. The twin battlements on either side of the main facade would not have held any practical military purpose, but would have been added to the house as another statement of political dominance.

The author presents a conceptual framework for studying social systems with particular attention to how a society constructs roles and relations between the female and male halves of humanity. Overview Eisler highlights the tension between what she calls the dominator or domination model and the more naturally feminine partnership model. Eisler proposes tension between these two underlies the span of human cultural evolution. She traces this tension in Western culture from prehistory to the present. The book closes with two contrasting future scenarios. These challenge conventional views about cultural evolution up to the time of the book's publication. The book is now in 26 foreign editions, THE FOLLOWING EDITIONS SHOULD BE IN THE FOOTNOTES: including most European languages as well as Chinese, Japanese, Urdu, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, and Turkish. Briefly her thesis is despite old narratives about an inherently flawed humanity, more and more evidence shows humanity is not doomed to perpetuate patterns of violence and oppression. Female values offer a partnership alternative with deep roots in the pre-Patriarchy paradigm of cultural evolution. No utopia is predicted; rather, a way of structuring society in more peaceful, equitable, and sustainable ways is envisioned. Proposed method of social analysis The method of social analysis in the book is multidisciplinary in its study of relational dynamics. In contrast to earlier studies of society, this method concerns what kinds of social systems support the human capacity for consciousness, caring, and creativity, or conversely for insensitivity, cruelty, and destructiveness.Eisler, R. \\"Human Possibilities:The Interaction of Biology and Culture\\", Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies. (2014) The study of relational dynamics is an application of systems analysis: the study of how different components of living systems interact to maintain one another and the larger whole of which they are a part.Emery F. E. and Trist E. L. 1973. Toward a social ecology: Contextual appreciation of the future and the present. New York: Plenum Press. Drawing from a trans-disciplinary database, it applies this approach to a wide-ranging exploration of how humans think, feel, and behave individually and in groups.

Marie-Claire Cordonier Segger and S√©bastien Jodoin, editors, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.305-326. A distinguishing feature of the study of relational dynamics pays particular attention to matters marginalized or ignored in conventional male-oriented studies. It highlights the importance of how a society constructs relations between the male and female halves of humanity, as well as between them and their daughters and sons, taking into account findings from both the biological and social sciences showing the critical importance of the \\"private\\" sphere of family and other intimate relations in shaping beliefs and behaviors. New perspective on cultural evolution The author compares two underlying types of social organization in which the cultural construction of gender roles and relations is key. Eisler places human societies on what she calls the partnership-domination continuum. At one end of the continuum are societies oriented to the partnership model. At the other are societies oriented to the dominator or domination model. These categories transcend conventional categories such as ancient vs. modern, Eastern vs. Western, religious vs. secular, rightist vs. leftist, and so on. The domination model ranks man over man, man over woman, race over race, and religion vs. religion, with difference equated with superiority or inferiority. It comprises an authoritarian structure in both family and state or tribe, rigid male dominance, and a high degree of abuse and violence. The partnership model consists of a democratic and egalitarian structure in both the family and state or tribe, with hierarchies of actualization where power is empowering rather than disempowering (as in hierarchies of domination). There is also gender partnership and a low degree of abuse and violence, as it is not needed to maintain rigid top-down rankings. Content In this book, Eisler traces tensions between these two models, starting in prehistory.

Paris: Edition D'Art Lucien Mazenod and Nikolas Platon.Platon, N. (1966) Crete. Geneva: Nagel Publishers Based on these findings, Eisler presents evidence how for the longest span of prehistory, cultures in the more fertile regions of the globe oriented primarily to the partnership model, which Eisler also calls a \\"gylany\\", a neologism for a society in which relationships between the sexes are an egalitarian partnership. This gender partnership was a core component of a more egalitarian, peaceful, and matrifocal culture with a focus on life- giving, centering on nurture. These societies once were widespread in Europe around the Mediterranean, and lasted well into the early Bronze Age in the Minoan civilization of Crete. Later, culture skewed towards Patriarchy during a chaotic time of upheaval related to climate change and incursions of warlike, nomadic tribes. These peoples brought with them a domination system and imposed rigid rankings of domination, including the rigid domination by men of women and the equation of \\"real masculinity\\" with power and violence. This led to radical cultural transformation. Eisler's book is not the only work describing this massive cultural shift. Other scholars have paid special attention to a radical change in gender relations. Historian Gerda Lerner details it in her Oxford University book The Creation of PatriarchyLerner, G. (1986). The Creation of Patriarchy. New York: Oxford University Press. However, Eisler does not use the term \\"patriarchy.\\" Nor does she use \\"matriarchy\\" to describe a more gender-balanced society, noting rule by fathers (patriarchy) and rule by mothers (matriarchy) can be two sides of a dominator coin. She proposed the real alternative is a partnership system or gylany. Nonetheless, some critics have accused Eisler of writing about a \\"matriarchy\\" in prehistoric times. According to them, she claims earlier societies where women were not subordinate were ideal. Eisler does point out how more partnership-oriented societies described in The Chalice and the Blade were more peaceful and generally equitable; yet, she emphasizes they were not ideal. She further makes it clear the point is not returning to any \\"utopia\\" but rather using what we learn from our past to move forward to a more equitable and sustainable future. Some archaeologists also question these earlier societies were more peaceful, especially critiques of Marija Gimbutas, one of Eisler's sources.These articles are good source for understanding this controversy: Marler, J. (1999). A Response to Brian Hayden‚Äôs Article: ‚ÄòAn Archaeological Evaluation of the Gimbutas Paradigm. The Pomegranate 10, Autumn, pp:37-47 and Marler, J. The Beginnings of Patriarchy in Europe: Reflections on the Kurgan Theory of Marija Gimbutas. In The Rule of Mars: The History and Impact of Patriarchy. Edited by Cristina Biaggi. Manchester, Conn.: Knowledge, Ideas, and Trends, Inc This critique fits the conventional narrative of cultural evolution as a linear progression from \\"barbarism\\" to \\"civilization\\"‚Äîa narrative Eisler challenges in light of the brutality of \\"civilizations\\" ranging from Chinese, Indian, Arab, and European empires to Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union. In addition, some archaeologists question whether the great profusion in these earlier cultures of female figurines, going back 30,000 years and perhaps even longer, indicates that they venerated a Goddess or Great Mother. Indeed, when these figurines were first excavated in the 19th century, the men who found them in millennia-old caves seemed to think they were an ancient kind of pornography, and called them Venus figures (a term still used today). But these sculptures are highly stylized, often pregnant, and sometimes with no facial features ‚Äì hardly the stuff of pornography. So today this notion has largely been discarded. Instead, some archaeologists contend that these stone sculptures are dolls. But the idea that prehistoric artists created these figurines for little girls flies in the face of the fact that these are nude figures with highly accentuated vulvas and breasts‚Äîhardly what one would associate with children's play. Moreover, some of these female sculptures could not be dolls since they are not portable. For instance, the famous Venus of LaSalle is carved on the rock facade of the entrance to a cave, which, as Eisler suggests in The Chalice and the Blade, was most probably the site of ancient religious rites celebrating the life-giving and sustaining powers inherent in woman's body and in our Mother Earth. Subsequent confirmation Since The Chalice and the Blade was published in 1987, new findings support its thesis of earlier gender equality as part of a more peaceful and equitable social system. For example, writing of the Minoan civilization noted above, Greek archeologist Nanno Marinatos confirmed this was a culture in which women played major roles in a religion where the Goddess was venerated. Marinatos also notes how this was a more peaceful culture; which unlike other \\"high civilizations\\" of the time, was not a slave society, but exhibited a generally high standard of living throughout.Marinatos, N. (1993). Minoan religion: Ritual, image, and symbol. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press. Further confirmation of Eisler's view of Neolithic society comes from archeologist Ian Hodder, who excavated √áatalh√∂y√ºk, one of the largest Neolithic sites found to date. Hodder confirms gender equity as a key part of a more partnership-oriented social configuration in this generally equitable early farming site where there are no signs of destruction through warfare for over 1,000 years.Hoddard, I. (2004). Women and Men at Catalhoyuk. Scientific American. January, pp. 77-83. In this 2004 Scientific American article Hodder writes‚Äî > Even analyses of isotopes in bones give no indication of divergence in > lifestyle translating into differences in status and power between women and > men... [which points to] a society in which sex is relatively unimportant in > assigning social roles, with neither burials nor space in houses suggesting > gender inequality. Going back further, to the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age, another body of research that supports Eisler's proposal that this period was also oriented to the partnership side of the domination-partnership continuum is on contemporary foraging societies, especially the anthologies edited by anthropologist Douglas P. Fry. This work is directly relevant to prehistoric times because for most of the millennia of our earliest cultural evolution our species lived in foraging groups. Fry's 2013 anthology of articles by scholars studying these types of societies documents that the vast majority of them are characterized by the more peaceful, gender balanced, and generally egalitarian configuration of the partnership model.Fry, Douglas, editor. (2013). War, Peace, and Human Nature: the Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views. New York: Oxford University Press. Data from other world regions also supports the thesis of an earlier partnership direction. For example, after The Chalice and the Blade was published in China by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a group of scholars at the Academy wrote a book showing there was also in Chinese prehistory a massive cultural shift from more partnership- oriented cultures to a system of rigid domination in both the family and the state.Mn, J.

Born to Elijah McLean, a physician, and Mary Stafford, she enjoyed a privileged childhood with academic opportunities uncommon for girls of her time period. After graduating from the University of Michigan Medical School, she became the first woman to hold an official position at the St. Louis Female Hospital and the first woman admitted to the St. Louis Medical Society. McLean established a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology in 1885. Concerned with young women's health and hygiene, she established the Evening Dispensary for Women in 1893, the Emmaus Home for Girls, a precursor to the St. Louis Young Women's Christian Association, in 1904, and a free evening clinic for women in 1908. Interested in continuing her missionary work abroad, McLean traveled to China and Japan, where she operated in hospitals and learned about Chinese medical education. She practiced medicine until five months before her death and died on May 17, 1930, in St. Louis, having never married. Background and education Early life Mary Hancock McLean was born on February 28, 1861, to Elijah McLean, a local physician, and Mary Stafford in Washington, Missouri.\\"Mary Hancock McLean.\\" American National Biography Online. American National Biography, February 2000. Web. 10 October 2015. Despite his age (fifty-seven years old at the time of his daughter's birth), Elijah McLean was determined to provide her with the finest education. McLean was privately tutored until age thirteen.Hunt, Marion. \\"Woman's Place in Medicine: The Life of Dr. Mary Hancock McLean.\\" The Bulletin of the Missouri Historical Society 36 (1980): n. pag. Becker Exhibits. Washington University in St. Louis. Web. 11 Oct. 2015. Education At age thirteen, she enrolled in Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri and graduated with the class of 1878 three years later. She then transferred to Vassar College, from where she graduated two years later. Vassar College had just opened in 1865 and became one of the first institutions to provide women with an education comparable to that which men were receiving. Whereas female seminaries in the early nineteenth century prepared women for solely domestic roles, the opening of institutions such as Vassar College afforded women other options. Medicine became a popular vocation for women as it was argued that it was an extension of their activities in the home by serving women and children. With dreams of becoming a physician like her father, McLean graduated with a medical degree from the University of Michigan Medical School, an institution more receptive to female students, in 1883. Career in St. Louis St. Louis Female Hospital With her father's influence and the help of a family friend, General Stevenson, McLean became an assistant physician at the St. Louis Female Hospital in 1884.Brownlee, Richard S., ed. \\"Missouri Women in History: Dr. Mary Hancock McLean.\\" Missouri Historical Review 64.3 (1970): n. pag. Print. She became the first woman to hold an official position in the city hospitals. In this position, she cared mainly for impoverished patients, especially prostitutes who suffered from venereal diseases. McLean was considered both a humanitarian and devout Presbyterian, who viewed her medical work as social reform and was as concerned with her patients' moral conditions as their physical ailments. In 1885, with the support of her sponsor, the ophthalmologist Simon Pollak, McLean became the first woman to be admitted to the St. Louis Medical Society. She would later become one of the few female members of the American College of Surgeons and a fellow of the American Medical Association. Private practice in obstetrics and gynecology In 1885, McLean established a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology. Her father financed her practice. However, she encountered many obstacles in renting office space as landlords feared that the stigma of housing a female physician would lead to lower property values. She finally found a residence on Olive Street in a neighborhood known as \\"Scab Row\\" but was not allowed to post any signs with her name or profession. One of her colleagues, Frances L. Bishop, described McLean's first few weeks in private practice: > ‚Ä≥It was slow work establishing herself, for there were few women physicians. > She has often told, in her racy way, to young women physicians who were soon > discouraged at a slow beginning, that for the first three weeks she did not > have a one patient. But the tide turned.\\" Her first patient was a black servant named Tillie, who suffered from a uterine fibroid. Lacking access to a hospital, McLean operated in Tillie's home. Dr. Bishop provided a description of McLean's first major operation: > \\"The case was a uterine fibroid, in a colored woman, a former servant, who > was finally persuaded to submit to the operation. Dr. McLean spent days > sterilizing her own instruments and dressings, and preparing the woman‚Äôs > house for the operation. She employed two trained nurses. All this at an > outlay of some $250, her own expense. The operation was successful, but for > some days afterwards Dr. McLean was in a great state of extreme > anxiety....Tillie lived and recovered a well woman, and Dr. McLean was > launched on a surgical career.\\" Humanitarian work in Missouri Evening Dispensary for Women In 1893, McLean and another female physician named Ella Marx opened the Evening Dispensary for Women at 1607 Washington Avenue. The two provided medical advice and treatment to working women. They charged a small fee for those who could afford it, but most services were free.Corbett, Katharine T. In Her Place: A Guide to St. Louis Women's History. St. Louis: Missouri Historical Society, 1999. Print. Emmaus Home for Girls In 1904, Dr. Mary Hancock McLean opened the Emmaus Home for Girls with a group of women from local Protestant churches in response to the opening of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition that spring. Many rural women flocked to St. Louis to look for work and take part in the excitement of urban life. However, most earned less than five dollars per week for a ten-hour working day and suffered exploitation due to their lack of employment skills. This home was created in order to shelter female transients \\"from temptation in all forms.\\" The home remained open after the fair closed and affiliated with the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) in 1905, for which McLean served on the board of directors. She was especially concerned with these young girls' health and hygiene. McLean gave them physical examinations and uncovered many cases of heart disease and untreated rheumatic fever. Furthermore, she aided the organization in its construction of a gymnasium, sponsored instruction in posture and health, expanded the YWCA's programs into factories and department stores, and introduced sex education into a preventative health program. Evening clinic In 1908, McLean along with several younger female doctors created an evening clinic at 1900 Washington Avenue. The clinic is described as being \\"run by women, for women\\" and was open several nights per week in order to provide for the medical needs of working women. Missionary work in Asia Missionary journey and medical service in China and Japan In the early 1900s, McLean made several trips to China and Japan, where she operated in hospitals and studied Chinese medical education. She hoped to move there permanently but was forced to return to St. Louis after several months in Asia due to her poor health and the harsh climate. Once again, her colleague, Dr. Bishop, commented on her interest in learning more about this region and aiding the people who lived there: > \\"She made several trips to China and hoped to locate (there) permanently, > but climatic conditions did not warrant this. However, in the months she > spent in China she operated in many hospitals in cities where she had > medical friends. She was always vitally interested in the education of the > Chinese. Some twenty Chinese boys and girls owe their education and > especially their medical education to Dr. McLean‚Äôs personal and financial > support. Many of these during their years in school found a home in her > home.\\" Return from missionary service Although McLean only remained in Asia for a few months, she remained interested in aiding the people of that region. McLean was always devoted to aiding young women aspiring to become medical professionals. For example, she secured a teaching job for Bertha van Hoosen, whom she had met at the University of Michigan, in order to help her raise funds for medical school.Hoosen, Bertha Van. Petticoat Surgeon. Chicago: Pellegrini & Cudahy, 1947. Hathi Trust. Web. 11 Oct. 2015. This passion continued as she supported at least twenty Chinese and Japanese students through American medical schools. Many of them stayed in her home in St. Louis. One of her Chinese prot√©g√©es, Dr. Li Yuin Tsao, became an intern for Van Hoosen once she had established a career in medicine in Chicago. Death and legacy End of career McLean broke her wrist in 1928, forcing her to end her surgical career. However, she continued to work in her private practice in obstetrics and gynecology until a few months before her death. She never married but lived with her sister at 4339 Delmar Boulevard. At this location, she also maintained a medical office from 1914 until her death. Dr. Mary Hancock McLean passed away on May 17, 1930, in St. Louis. Legacy Dr. Mary Hancock McLean was considered a pioneer in St. Louis public health. Her commitment to providing for the health needs of working women is evident from her private practice in obstetrics and gynecology and creation of the Evening Dispensary for Women, Emmaus Home for Girls, and a free evening clinic. Her passion for social change and religious conviction motivated her to travel to China and Japan to continue her missionary work in that region and inspired others to do the same, such as her prot√©g√©e, Bertha van Hoosen, who traveled from Canton to Peking and conducted medical operations along the way. In addition, McLean made tremendous strides for women in the medical profession. She was the first woman to hold a position in the St. Louis city hospitals and the first female practitioner admitted to the St. Louis Medical Society. She used her influence in aiding young women, both American and Asian, in their medical careers as well. Through her dedication to the medical field, including both her humanitarian work in Missouri and missionary work in Asia, Dr. Mary Hancock McLean's legacy remains.

Ross recorded new versions of \\"Be a Lion\\" and \\"Home\\" for the album, together with a previously unreleased song, \\"Wonder, Wonder Why\\". Home had been released as part of a 2001 Motown compilation album, while a different version of \\"Ease on Down the Road\\" had been released in 1978 as a duet with Michael Jackson. All other tracks remained unreleased until 2015. The reissue was remastered and produced by Andrew Skurow, George Solomon, and Harry Weinger. The album was released ahead of the premiere of The Wiz Live! (a new adaptation of the 1975 Broadway musical) with newcomer Shanice Williams reprising Ross' role of Dorothy (originally played by Stephanie Mills in the original Broadway play) in the television special that was seen by 11.5 million viewers on NBC.

In addition to serving as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives, he was a Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court for two years. Biography Turner was born in October 1760 in what would become Canaan, Connecticut. He served in the Continental Army as a member of Captain Thomas Converse's Company, 7th Connecticut Regiment during the American Revolutionary War. In 1780, he graduated from the Litchfield Law School. Turner practiced law in Connecticut, and moved to Vermont in 1798; he originally resided in Fairfield, and later in St. Albans. For a time, his law partner in St. Albans was Asa Aldis, who subsequently served as Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. Turner subsequently returned to Fairfield; in addition to practicing law, he also trained several prospective attorneys, including William C. Wilson. For brief periods, he lived in Middlebury and Fairfield, before finally returning to St. Albans. Turner's legal instruction was so sought after that he eventually began offering a formal program of study, which was organized along the lines of the Litchfield Law School. During his career, between 175 and 200 attorneys obtained their legal education with Turner. Turner was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives in 1813. He served on the Supreme Court from 1827 to 1828. In 1829, he was a member of the Council of Censors, which met every seven years to review actions of Vermont's government and ensure their constitutionality. Death and burial Turner died in St. Albans on April 30, 1847. He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in St. Albans. Family In 1796, Turner married Mrs. Persis Humphrey of Rhode Island. She died in 1814, and in 1815 he married Mrs. Sarah Webb of North Hero. His nephew, Josiah Turner, who had read law under him, became a Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Another relative, Wolcott Turner Brooks, served as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. Turner's stepdaughter Abigail Webb was married to Herman R.

While its original task was ocean rescue of downed pilots, its speedy and well-armed boats soon became prime vehicles for inserting spies, espionage agents, and sabotage parties into enemy territory for the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron. Despite the hazards of both their overt and covert missions, the airmen of the 22nd CRBS never lost a boat during their clandestine operations in the war. Precedents and foundation The peninsular Korean War began at 0400 hours on 25 June 1950 when North Koreans invaded South Korea,Futrell, p. 5. quickly brought crash rescue boats back out of storage as a wartime expedient for combat search and rescue operations. The 6160th Air Base Group activated a boat section as Detachment 1; it comprised a lieutenant and four enlisted men with a 114-foot FP-47 cutter. Detachment 1 rapidly acquired a cadre of 85 personnel to man a 104-foot boat, eight 85-footers, and seven 63-footers in addition to the original FP-47. Its initial commander was First Lieutenant Phil Dickey.Haas (2002), p. 68. With the backing of influential senior officers, he set out to gather all crash rescue boats and their experienced handlers into the new unit.Haas (2000), pp. 106‚Äì107. In July 1952, at Itazuke Air Base, the detachment was formed into the 22nd Crash Rescue Boat Squadron. It had grown to include 31 officers and 232 airmen sailors, and included all in-theater crash boat personnel. Its strength would eventually rise to over 400 men.Haas (2002), p. 72.Haas (2000), p. 112. 5th Air Force Headquarters took direct charge of the unit, leaving only administrative details to the 6160th. This makeshift arrangement led to the unit's crewmen being harassed for their unmilitary appearance and unorthodox boat repairs even as they were ill supplied with all the necessities for their tasks.Haas (2000), pp. 112‚Äì113. Equipment The unarmored wooden crash boats mounted M45 Quadmount .50 caliber machine guns as the main armament, and a single .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun both port and starboard, as well as on the stern. The larger 85-foot R-2s may have also mounted a 20mm on the stern. The speed was needed to fetch pilots from the frigid ocean before they died of hypothermia. The guns would be handy for combat search and rescue, as well as other missions. The U.S. Air Force sailors' 85 ft. crash rescue boats were powered by twin Packard 4M-2500 marine engines, giving them over 3,000 horsepower and a high rate of speed, over 40 knots.Haas (2002), pp. 67, 69‚Äì71. Mission range could stretch from 200 to 400 miles. A mother ship sometimes resupplied the crash boats so they could extend their patrols in communist waters.Haas (2002), pp. 72‚Äì73.Haas (2000), p. 107. Personnel The master of the boat was usually ranked as an E-5 or E-6. His crew of seven to nine subordinates included a medic, radio operator, engine man, and cook. The latter had alcohol stoves available, but no refrigeration. Fresh water was hand pumped, and limited to 500 gallons on the 63-foot R-1 boats, with some of that needed for the engines' cooling systems. The unbathed unshaven crew had little or no heat in the boats. While a month's sea duty was considered the maximum, crew members often spent twice that time afloat without a break. Casualties were incurred via poor diet, illness, and exposure, as well as communist actions.Haas (2000), p. 108. Boats assigned This list is incomplete. * 114-foot PCF 47 * Crash Rescue Boat serial number R-1-664 * Crash Rescue Boat s/n R-1-676-DPUO * Utility Motor Boat s/n U-52-1197Author unknown, Historical Data Pertaining to Crash-Rescue Boats R-1-664 and R-1-676-DPUO in the Korean Operation December 1951 ‚Äì August 1953\\"; Special Projects Section, USAF Historical Division; pp. 2‚Äì3. * Crash Rescue Boat s/n R-1-667 * Crash Rescue Boat R-1-654 * Crash Rescue Boat U-9-890 * Crash Rescue Boat R-37A-1333 Bases The boats and crews were dispersed to stations in Korea at Pusan, Pohang, Chinhae, and Kunsan. They were also located on Guam, Okinawa, and Japan. While crewmen kept their Air Force ranks, they used naval ratings as their work assignments. Typically, the 22nd had little contact with the rest of the USAF, and were largely left to their own devices. Noncommissioned officers, not officers, commanded the boats.Haas (2002), pp. 68‚Äì69, 72. The headquarters of the Air Force's navy was a Quonset hut mounted on a steel barge in Kunsan Harbor. The boats and their crews rotated to Japan for maintenance and repair‚Äîsometimes of battle damage from inshore firefights or deep water brushes with North Korean patrol boats.Edwards, p. 201. Operations Korean waters offered stiff challenges to the crash rescue boats. The sea was not only freezing cold, with floating ice; the rise and fall of Korea's 30-foot tides are among the greatest in the world. The weather was no more hospitable, sometimes hitting minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit.Haas (2002), pp. 71‚Äì72. With near-daily overwater bailouts of United Nations pilots taking place off the North Korean coast, the USAF found it necessary to station four 85-foot boats in those waters to rescue them. Sometimes the rescue boatmen had to pick up the fallen from close inshore, or from the coast. For instance, on 8 September 1951, Crash Rescue Boat R-1-676 sidled up to the sandbar blocking the mouth of the Taedong River near Nampo to pick up a downed pilot. While picking up the pilot and two rescuing crew members of the boat, they came under artillery fire despite the overwatch of the Dutch destroyer, HNLMS Evertsen. The rescue was successful. One wounded crewman received the Purple Heart, but other medal awards were refused. However, such exploits brought them an added assignment.Haas (2000), pp. 107‚Äì108. The crash rescue unit was soon involved in more than rescue missions. Since there were no alternative vessels available, the crash rescue boats became engaged in covert operations involving the friendly guerrillas on the islands scattered off both the east and west coast of Korea. Boats and crews were lent on temporary duty to Donald Nichols and his Detachment 2 of the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron a month at a time. The Air Force sailors roved north of the 38th Parallel in the dark to insert Korean Marines or guerrillas into mainland North Korea to conduct attacks behind communist lines.Haas (2002), pp. 69‚Äì72. The scanty official records show that between 16 November 1951 and 10 January 1952, Crash Rescue Boat R-1-667 inserted espionage agents into Port Arthur, Manchuria, as well as on the Chinese shore of the Yalu River. During November, one of these agents was noted to be a blond blue-eyed Caucasian who failed to be exfiltrated.Haas (2000), pp. 111‚Äì112. In April 1952, Far East Command ordered crash rescue boat commanders to provoke bank robberies in North Korea, both for the communist currency and for general economic sabotage. Some of the agents being infiltrated into North Korea also passed counterfeit currency to disrupt the communists' economy. In October, a North Korean junk infiltrated one of the 22nd's main bases, at Chodo Island, but was repelled with the loss of two prisoners left behind.Haas (2002), p. 71, 74. In March 1953, Boat R-1-664 inserted a team of five agents near the MiG-15 base of Antung, China. Again the exfiltration was unsuccessful. By war's end, despite the hazards of infiltrations behind enemy lines into North Korean and China, the 22nd Crash Rescue Boat Squadron had lost no boats.Haas (2002), p. 70. Its last reported activities were in August 1953.

Composed at the beginning of the 17th century, it is the first known prose romance written by an English woman. The full work exists in two volumes, the first published in 1621 and the second written, but unpublished, during Wroth's lifetime. The novel also contains several versions of Wroth's sonnet sequence Pamphilia to Amphilanthus, distributed throughout the prose and reproduced in sequence at the end of the volume. Composition The title page of Urania, engraved by Simon van de Passe. The precise dates for Urania's composition are unknown, but Wroth probably began writing the first volume between 1615 and 1620.Margaret P. Hannay, Mary Sidney, Lady Wroth (Farnham, Surrey, England: Ashgate, 2010), 230. Initially, it was written for the enjoyment of Wroth's family circle, and could have been composed, in part, at the home of William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, in London. The early manuscript of Urania may have circulated amongst Wroth's household, family, and friends as evening entertainment; if so, their responses to the text aided her revision of the manuscript.Hannay 247.Gary Waller, The Sidney Family Romance: Mary Wroth, William Herbert, and the Early Modern Construction of Gender (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1993), 252. Sources Sources for Urania include Wroth's uncle Philip Sidney's The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia. Wroth may have drawn the name of her work's title from the Arcadia, as one of its significant characters is named \\"Urania.\\"Hannay 230. Other literary sources include Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene and Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso.Hannay 210. Anthony Munday's English translation of Amadis de Gaule, published in 1618 and 1619, may have also been a major source for Wroth. The romance inspired several of Urania's plotlines, including the Throne of Love sequence near the beginning of the work.Mary Wroth, The First Part of the Countess of Montgomery's Urania, ed. Josephine Roberts (Binghamton, NY: Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies, State University of New York at Binghamton, 1995), xvii. Wroth also drew heavily on the political and social world around her, and many of the work's storylines have connections to Wroth's family, court life, and historical events of the early 17th century. Publication John Marriott and John Grismand entered Urania into the Stationers' Register on 13 July 1621.\\"The Countesse of Montgomeries Urania,\\" English Short Title Catalogue, http://estc.bl.uk/S122291. Wroth had loose connections to Marriott and Grismand through her cousin William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. Herbert was a patron of George Wither, whose Wither's Motto: Nec habeo, nec careo, nec curo prompted his, Marriott's, and Grismand's arrest, along with printer Augustine Matthews', in early 1621. On 4 June 1621 the printer and publishers were fined for the publication of Motto; Marriott and Grismand spent some time in Marshalsea, and were released on 10 July, three days before entering Urania into the Stationers' Register. The edition was printed by Matthews. His work was identified based on the type and printer's ornaments used, borrowed from his contemporary Felix Kingston. He may have shared the book's printing with his partner John White. Matthews may have been confused by Wroth's abrupt midsentence ending of Urania, and left the remainder of the final page blank, perhaps in the hopes that he would eventually receive material to complete the volume. This is in contrast to the way he printed the end of the first three parts of Urania, which are decorated with a printer's ornament and an announcement, in italic type, declaring \\"the end of the first Booke,\\" etc.Roberts, The First Part of the Countess of Montgomery's Urania, cvii-cx. Matthews printed a small number of copies before Wroth's attempted to withdraw the volume from circulation.Waller 247-249. Twenty-nine of those seventeenth-century copies survive to today. The title page was engraved by Simon van de Passe. Van de Passe had minor connections to Wroth and her family, as he painted several portraits of members of Wroth's relatives, including her aunt Mary Sidney, the Countess of Pembroke. The content-specific nature of the title page is unusual for the time, and may signal Wroth's intention to publish Urania. The title page's design and dedication resemble those of the Arcadia, and indicate Wroth's attempt to insert herself into the family literary canon.Hannay 233. The level of Wroth's involvement in its publication is unknown. Marriott and Grismand could have acquired a copy of her manuscript without Wroth's knowledge, but in a letter to George Villiers, Wroth does not deny knowing of its publication. She may have circulated her manuscript among aristocratic friends to encourage its distribution to publishers. This strategy would yield publication of the novel, while allowing her to avoid the aristocratic stigma against those who circulated their work in print.Roberts, The First Part of the Countess of Montgomeries Urania, cv. Given the specificity of her corrections in her own copy of Urania, Wroth probably intended to have her work printed, though she may not have personally instigated the process through direct contact with publishers. Content The sprawling romance follows the political and romantic adventures of several imaginary royal and noble families. The work contains over a thousand characters, and spirals into hundreds of subsidiary plotlines, which are interspersed with Wroth's sonnet sequence Pamphilia to Amphilanthus. The work is largely centered around the relationship between Queen Pamphilia and Emperor Amphilanthus; their meetings are surrounded by storylines involving their various siblings, and many other tertiary characters.Waller 249. While Wroth may not have intended to write Urania as a roman √† clef, many of the work's storylines and characters have strong parallels to events and people in Wroth's life. One of the most notable storylines connected to Wroth's life is that of the romance between Pamphilia and Amphilanthus, who serve as avatars for Wroth and her cousin William Herbert, respectively. The romance identifies Pamphilia and Amphilanthus as first cousins, as were Wroth and Herbert. As first cousins, both couples had to hide their relationships; thus Urania contains Wroth's hope of the sanctioning of her relationship with Herbert. In the novel, Pamphilia meets with Amphilanthus' mother, the Queen of Naples; the Queen subsequently approves of the couple's relationship, indicating Wroth's ambition that her aunt Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, would give the real-world couple her blessing. In the manuscript continuation of Urania, the appearance of two illegitimate children, Andromarko and Faire Design, is closely tied to the birth of Katherine and William, Wroth's natural children fathered by Herbert. The manuscript continuation also blatantly reveals the cousins' relationship, which may have prevented Wroth from pursuing its publication. In the revelatory passage, Wroth attributes the romance's reproduction of one of Herbert's poems to Amphilanthus, which strikingly exposes the connection between herself, Herbert, and Urania's characters.Waller 255-257. Themes in Urania Urania introduced controversial themes concerning gender. Wroth was a radical in her time merely for writing a work intended for public consumption. For the time, the act of composing a novel by a woman violated the ideals of female virtue. Bernadette Andrea, a literary critic who focuses on gender themes in Urania in her work \\"Pamphilia's Cabinet: Gendered Authorship and Empire in Lady Mary Wroth's Urania\\", writes that female virtues at the time were seen to be silence and obedience.Andrea, Bernadette. \\"Pamphilia's Cabinet: Gendered Authorship and Empire in Lady Mary Wroth's Urania\\". English Literary History 68.2, 2001. Project Muse. muse.jhu.edu.ezp.slu.edu/journals/elh/v068/68.2andrea.html In genteel society, an unmarried woman of the time was expected to be chaste, silent, and obedient and this theme is reiterated throughout contemporary religious works, legal treaties, and literature. The three themes were considered linked: a woman's silence and obedience were considered evidence of her chastity.Andrea 336 By writing a text intended for a public audience, critics like Andrea claim that Wroth was acting against the accepted ideals of the established patriarchy and so calling her own moral character into question. Urania is the titular character of the work, but is not the character that represents Wroth in the work. In the work, Urania is an orphan and is the daughter of a shepherd. She is actually the biological offspring of the daughter of the King of Naples, and comes to this realization over the course of the work through a series of pastoral songs and sonnets with the shepherds. Pamphilia, as Wroth's representative, is the female character who most struggles with the mindset of the contemporary world in which Wroth wrote.Andrea 335 Pamphila, which is Greek for all loving, struggles throughout the text with the infidelity of her lover Amphialanthus, which is Greek for \\"one with two loves.\\" Pamphilia must conceal her songs so that her moral character is not called into question by others in Urania. Pamphila carries around her works in a little cabinet and keeps them to herself because society would shun them.Andrea 337 She is however, rewarded in the work for her actions. She becomes a queen in Asia Minor despite her lack of the contemporary virtues of silence, chastity, and obedience.Andrea 338 Her compositions, although mostly secret, are still a violation of the code of what a woman should be. Wroth does not demonize, but glorifies, her transgression. Reception The two published responses to Urania in the 1620s favor the work and associate Wroth with the Sidney family's literary canon. Henry Peacham, in the 1622 The Compleat Gentleman, names her ‚Äúan inheretrix of the Divine wit of her immortal Uncle‚Äù after reading Urania. In 1624, Thomas Heywood includes Wroth, along with her aunt Mary Sidney, in Gynaikeion: or, Nine Books of Various History Concerning Women.Hannay 248. Urania also seems to have been read by aristocratic women in the time of its publication, as a copy entered the library of the Countess of Bridgewater in 1627. Later in the seventeenth century, Margaret Cavendish references Wroth and her works in ‚ÄúTo All Noble, and Worthy Ladies,‚Äù in her 1664 Poems and Phancies.Hannay 307. Other responses, however, were much less positive, especially those of the aristocracy, who seemed to take issue with the use of her contemporaries as inspiration. The exact nature of that inspiration has not been fully defined by contemporary scholars. Virginia Woolf correctly claimed that any woman who composed a work of fiction during the period of the Renaissance would be \\"thought a monster\\". One of her contemporaries claims that the \\"whole world condemns\\" her work. Given the references cited above, this sentiment was certainly not universal, but aristocratic society rejected the book out of hand as shameful gossip by a sinful woman whose error consisted of writing a book containing her thoughts.Miller 121 After her altercation with Sir Edward Denny, Wroth wrote to George Villiers, claiming that the work was published against her will and that she had already made efforts to stop it from being sold. In the letter, Wroth requests that Villiers return his copy of the book to her. Wroth may have attempted to remove Urania from circulation, but there is no record of an official warrant recalling the book. Edward Denny The most well-known of contemporary reactions to Urania was Sir Edward Denny's, who responded intensely to what he perceived as his negative representation in the novel. Satirizing Denny insulted a man whose heritage was tied up with Wroth's. The Dennys lived near Wroth in Essex, and were important local figures in the region that is now known as Epping Forest. The Wroths were based in Loughton and Denny a few miles away in Waltham Abbey. Denny's father, also named Edward, worked closely with the Sidneys in Ireland and with Wroth's father-in- law, Sir Robert Wroth.Hannay 237-238. Denny objected to a story narrated by one of the novel's shepherds, which detailed the marriages of a melancholy character named Sirelius. Sirelius falls in love with an aristocrat's only daughter, purportedly desiring her love, but upon marriage, quickly becomes jealous and accuses his wife of adultery with another young lord; his false speculations are compounded by the discovery of letters to the lord in his wife's cabinets. In response to her husband's jealously, the aristocrat attempts to kill his daughter, who now requires Sirelius' protection. This event catalyzes their reconciliation, and the couple have a son and a daughter before she dies. Sirelius then marries the daughter of a Romanian duke, and his new father-in-law attempts to prevent the marriage by locking up his daughter. For this storyline, Wroth seems to have drawn upon the lives of Denny, his daughter Honoria, James Hay, Lucy Percy Hay, and Lucy's father, the Earl of Northumberland. Honoria, Denny's only daughter, married Sir James Hay on 6 January 1607. They were married until August 1614, when Honora miscarried and died from complications thereof. There is no extant evidence of any marital troubles between James and Honora, but Hay was occasionally in conflict with Wroth's brother Robert, during which he proved to have a violent temper. This indicates that Wroth may have satirized him as Sirelius, which would tie Honora Hay and her father into Urania's plotline. Wroth may have been privy to some scandalous gossip through her friendship with Lucy Percy Hay, Hay's second wife; she was known for her stories and satirical, anonymous portraits of members of court. Lucy's marriage is clearly represented in this portion of Urania, as Lucy Percy's father, Henry Percy, attempted to prevent her marriage to Hay in 1617 by keeping her with him in the Tower of London, where he was imprisoned for purported involvement in the Gunpowder Plot.Hannay 234-236. Denny retaliated against Urania's implications by circulating his own satirical poem about Wroth, in which he labels her a \\"hermaphrodite in show, in deed a monster.\\" Denny also accuses her of madness and unchastity, and concluded his satire with a condemnation of women who write fiction. Wroth acquired a copy of the poem on 15 February 1622 and fired back immediately with a poem of her own. In it, she accuses him of drunkenness and venery, returns his \\"hermaphrodite\\" insult, and names him a \\"lying wonder.\\" She also makes unspecified threats of further courses of action against Denny. Denny returned a letter to Wroth on 26 February 1622, in which he intimates that her book has been largely condemned by the court, and urges her to turn toward translating psalms in the manner of her \\"virtuous and learned aunt\\" Mary Sidney.Paul Salzman. \\"Contemporary References in Wroth‚Äôs Urania\\", pp. 179. Wroth's 27 February letter to Denny shows her attempts to backpedal from any connections in Urania to herself and others at court. In this letter, she also proposes Denny bring her accusers before her in order for her to prove her full innocence. Denny closes the extant correspondence with an affirmation that he will not engage her further, and that he intended to do her no more wrong. The Dennys and Wroths may have eventually rekindled their relationship, as Wroth served as executrix of a will in 1636 along with a Denny relative.Hannay 239-241. Modern reception There are no extant eighteenth-century references to Urania. Study of the work resurfaces in the nineteenth century in Alexander Dyce's 1825 Specimens of British Poetesses, in which Dyce reproduces two poems from Pamphilia to Amphilanthus and lists Urania as their source. Later in the nineteenth century, Urania was referenced as an inferior version of the Arcadia in an 1890 history of the English novel by J. J. Jusserand.Paul Salzman, Reading Early Modern Women's Writing, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 87. Manuscript continuation Wroth composed the second volume of Urania between 1620 and 1630.Mary Wroth, The Second Part of the Countess of Montgomery's Urania, ed. by Josephine A. Roberts, Suzanne Gossett, and Janel M. Mueller (Tempe, AZ: Renaissance English Text Society in Conjunction with Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 1999), xxv. Currently held at the Newberry Library, Wroth's holograph manuscript was probably a working copy, as it contains a variety of corrections and additions. The manuscript ends midsentence, as the does the text in the first volume of Urania, though this may have been unintentional, since the final leaf in the manuscript does not have a \\"Finis\\" or any other concluding marks that marked the end of the other volume.Hannay 264-265. The manuscript continuation has about 240,000 words.Gossett, The Second Part of the Countess of Montgomery's Urania, xviii. The manuscript also contains a missing bifolio that leaves unknown part of Amphilanthus' journey in this volume. The folio was probably removed after Wroth completed the manuscript, and eliminated by either Wroth herself or William Herbert based on concern that a page affirming the consummation of the relationship between Pamphilia and Amphilanthus would publicly affirm the relationship between the cousins.Gossett, The Second Part of the Countess of Montgomery's Urania, xxv- xxvi. Other signs that the manuscript is unfinished include incomplete plot lines and blank spaces to fill in either characters' names or poems.Gossett, The Second Part of the Countess of Montgomery's Urania, xxviii. Narrative changes Volume two generally follows a \\"second generation\\" of characters descended from those that appear in the first volume, though some characters from the preceding volume, like Pamphilia to Amphilanthus, also appear. In this volume, the geographic setting expands to include Persia and Babylon, referring respectively to Iran and Iraq. Rather than exploring the dyanstic fates of \\"European\\" monarchies, Wroth shifts her characters' destinies to the East, where many of her second-generation characters find themselves ruling. This second part resists the purported united between East and West set up by Wroth in the first volume, as characters displaced into the East are never reunited or reconnected with the West via marriage or, simply, return. Part Two's resistance to Islam may also reinforce the conceit of separation, as Wroth only uses pre-Islamic names for her settings and pits Islam against Christianity in elaborate battle narratives. This anti-Muslim sentiment is corroborated by a general reassertion of European aggression toward Islam in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, founded on the Ottoman Empire's encroaching deeper into Europe. Despite these \\"epic encounters\\" between Christianity and Islam, the second volume of Urania is more pessimistic about the prominence of the former than the first volume; characters generally achieve momentary, but not lasting, happiness in their private and public lives.Mueller, The Second Part of the Countess of Montgomery's Urania, xxviii- xxxiv. Modern Edition After its initial publication in 1621, Urania remained out of print until the end of the 20th century. A scholarly edition was published in 1995 and edited by Josephine Roberts, and an edition of the manuscript continuation of Urania, edited by Roberts, Suzanne Gossett, and Janel Mueller was published in 1999. In a 2015 essay, Sheila T. Cavanagh, a professor at Emory University, proposed an online, crowdsourced classroom edition of Urania. It is not known whether its development currently exists beyond this proposal.Sheila T.

Cafe Lafitte in Exile is a bar in New Orleans' French Quarter that has operated continuously since 1933. It claims to be the oldest continuously operating gay bar in the United States (along with White Horse Inn in Oakland, California which has also operated since 1933). Name Originally, Cafe Lafitte bar was opened in a famous old building at 941 Bourbon Street known as Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop. When the owner of the business, Tom Caplinger, was forced to vacate that location, he reopened at 901 Bourbon Street and named the new bar Cafe Lafitte in Exile. History New Orleans Pride Parade, 2016 The bar is open 24 hours a day and has hosted such luminaries as Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote. Operating since the end of Prohibition (albeit in two different locations) the bar claims to be the oldest gay bar in operation in the United States. The original Cafe Lafitte in Exile opened in the building that had been the noted pirate Jean Lafitte's blacksmith business in the 18th century. This building is now called Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop. In its early days, the bar was managed by Mary Collins, a lesbian, and drew a mixed crowd of lesbians, homosexuals and heterosexuals. In the 1950s, during rising tension between the club and the landlord, manager Tom Caplinger moved the club to the building where it is now located. At the grand reopening party in 1953, patrons arrived costumed as their favorite 'exile', including people like Oscar Wilde, Dante, and Napoleon. In 1954, author John Steinbeck wrote an article about Tom Caplinger and Cafe Lafitte for the Saturday Evening Post, describing Caplinger as \\"an uninhibited, unkempt scholar, whose laissez-faire policy of running a gin mill can only be termed unique.\\", reprinted in Ghost Stories In the book Queer Hauntings, Ken Summers writes that bar patrons claim to have occasionally seen the ghosts of Cafe Lafitte's departed luminaries inside the bar, as well as a 'frisky' ghost named Mr. Bubbly who pinches people on their rear ends.

Life  Frank was born in 1923 and lived all his life in Bermondsey, then a London Borough and now part of Southwark.  Death  Like tens of thousands of other UK Scouts, Frank used his skills and time to help in the war effort. Frank was working as a Messenger, carrying messages by hand between Civil Defence Posts during air raids. Whilst the original medal commendation has been lost, a contemporary newspaper article describes how Frank and a friend came across a burning incendiary device which had been dropped by a German aircraft on Dockhead, Bermondsey. Whilst trying to cover it with sand, Frank's friend was injured such that Frank carried him back to the Civil Defence post at The Most Holy Trinity Church. Frank then returned to the incendiary bomb to finish extinguishing it when two further high explosive bombs detonated and killed him. His body was found soon after. It was 8 December 1940 and Frank was 17. Frank's funeral took place on 13 December 1940 at St James' Church Bermondsey in Thurland Road. He was buried later the same day at Nunhead Cemetery in a plot close to where the Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorial now stands at the Limesford Road Entrance.

It is now believed that the structure was a farmstead or a hunting lodge, which was probably constructed sometime during the 19th century. The structure was modified extensively sometime before 1902. The turret is known to have been used as an anti-smuggling post during the 19th century. It was also used as a lookout post by the Northern Infantry Brigade during World War II. The building was abandoned after the war, and it fell in disrepair and was subsequently vandalized. Restoration Il-Majjistral Nature and History Park was established in 2007, and the turret fell within the limits of the park. By this time, the structure was in ruins with part of its roof having collapsed. By 2009, the Maltese government was making attempts to expropriate the structure from its owners, and the NGO Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa had gathered funds in order to restore it and turn it into a visitor centre. Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna also called for the tower's restoration. The turret was eventually restored by the government's Restoration Unit in 2012. Throughout the course of restoration, the entire south fa√ßade was dismantled and rebuilt, while the concrete staircase was demolished and replaced by one built out of limestone. Architecture Gƒßajn ≈ªnuber Tower is a limestone building which is two stories high and has thin walls. The south fa√ßade contains the main doorway on the ground floor, and it also has an external staircase leading to the top floor.

They were most popular in the late 1960s, when they released a string of hit singles with the contribution of renowned lyric-writer Mogol and songwriter Lucio Battisti,Dik Dik: Suite per una donna assolutamente relativaDik Dik, canzoni e biografia their greatest successes being Sognando la California and Senza luce, respectively covers of California Dreamin by The Mamas and Papas and A Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum.Review of Suite per una donna assolutamente relativa While their early production is mostly inspired by The Beatles, in the 1970s they also experimented in other genres, including progressive rock.Dik Dik: Biografia They went on hiatus in the 1980s but later returned to the scenes, mostly in revival television shows and live performances. History Dik Dik formed in Milan in 1965. The original line-up included Giancarlo Sbriziolo (aka Lallo) on vocals and bass, Pietro Montalbetti (aka Pietruccio) on guitar, Erminio Salvaderi (aka Pepe) on guitar, Sergio Panno on drums and Mario Totaro on keyboards. Their first single, 1-2-3, was a cover version of the song by Len Barry. Their second single, Sognando la California, was released in October 1966 and ended up topping the Italian chars for two months. Dik Dik subsequently released a string of successful singles, mostly a mix of original compositions and Italian renditions of popular songs by other artists, including Il mondo √® con noi (1966), Inno (1967, cover of Let's go to San Francisco by The Flower Pot Men), Senza luce (1967, cover of A Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum), Il vento (1968), and Il primo giorno di primavera (1969). In 1969 they performed with Rita Pavone at the Festival della canzone italiana in Sanremo. Other singles released in the following years include L'isola di Wight (1970), Vendo casa (1972), Storia di periferia (1973), Help Me (1974), and Volando (1975, a cover of Sailing by Rod Stewart). Their long-playing albums were not commercially successful. Their first three releases, largely collections of their singles, were published in 1967, 1969, and 1970 respectively. In 1972 the band recorded the first proper studio album, Suite per una donna assolutamente relativa (\\"Suite for an absolutely relative woman\\"), which was an experiment in progressive rock.Dik Dik Suite was conceived as a concept album about the feminine universe, with lyrics by artist and poet Herbert Pagani; it was very different from Dik Dik's previous production, and was somehow rejected by their audience, resulting in a commercial flop. As a consequence, the band thereafter returned to their earlier pop-beat style. From the mid-1970s to the early 1980s the band experienced several personnel changes, with Panno and Totaro leaving in 1974 (replaced by Roberto \\"Hunka Munka\\" Carlotto on keyboards and Nunzio \\"Cucciolo\\" Favia on drums), and Sbriziolo leaving in 1978 (replaced by two guitarists, Roberto \\"Roby\\" Facini and Rosario Brancati). In 1980 Carlotto was replaced by keyboard virtuoso Joe Vescovi, who had been collaborating with the band since 1974. Dik Dik's alienation of the mainstream audience continued with ambitious sonic experiments such as I'te vurria vas√† (1976), which drastically departed from Dik Dik's traditional sound, and also with the advent of disco music, which caused the decline of several pop-rock bands.I Dik Dik raccontati da Pietro Montalbetti After a couple of relatively successful singles, such as Laser vivente (1980) and Giornale di bordo (1982), the band went on hiatus. Pietruccio, Pepe, and Lallo eventually reconvened and released a few more singles such as L'amico mio (1983) and Senza luce... reggae (1984), and participated in the Musicaitalia per l'Etiopia humanitarian project for Ethiopia. In 1986, Favia and Carlotto gave life to a spin-off of the band, originally named \\"Carlotto e Cucciolo gi√† Dik Dik\\" or simply \\"Dik Dik\\", which led to a legal quarrel about the ownership of the \\"Dik Dik\\" brand. The dispute went on until 2006, when the name \\"Dik Dik\\" was finally given to Pietruccio, Pepe, and Lallo; Favia and Carlotto thus had to choose another name, \\"Gi√† Dik Dik\\" (\\"Ex Dik Dik\\"). From the second half of the 1980s, Dik Dik returned to the scenes participating in popular music revival television shows such as Una rotonda sul mare. In 1993 they performed again at the Festival di Sanremo together with former rivals I Camaleonti, another band from the 1960s-1970s Italian scene, and Maurizio Vandelli from Equipe 84. Dik Dik are still occasionally performing. In 1997 they have started their own website . In 2010, Pietruccio has published an autobiographical book about the history of the band, I ragazzi della via Stendhal (\\"The Via Stendhal Boys\\", a reference to Moln√°r's novel \\"The Paul Street Boys\\"La California in Via Stendhal as well as a reference to the street where Lallo and Pietruccio grew up in Milan).

Founded in 1969 by 15 dissidents, the unsanctioned group functioned for over six years as a public platform for Soviet dissidents concerned with violations of human rights in the Soviet Union. The main work of the group consisted in documenting abuses and preparing appeals. The letters focused on persecution of people for their convictions in the USSR, with particular attention being given to the use of punitive psychiatry and to political prisoners. Unusually for the dissident movement at the time, the appeals were directed to international organizations such as the UN Commission on Human Rights. The documents of the Initiative Group were circulated in samizdat, and published by the Western press, as well as being broadcast back into the USSR by radio stations such as Radio Liberty, the BBC World Service and Deutsche Welle. Most of the members of the group were harassed and persecuted: they and family members lost their jobs, they were arrested and imprisoned, or encouraged to leave the Soviet Union altogether. By 1979, all the founding members of the Group were imprisoned, in internal exile or living abroad. The Initiative Group served as a precursor and model, nevertheless, to a variety of dissident organizations that took over many of its functions, among them Andrei Sakharov's Committee on Human Rights in the USSR, the Moscow Helsinki Group, and the Commission on the Abuse of Psychiatry.  Founding  In late 1968, Ivan Yakhimovich, a philologist and chairman of a collective farm in Latvia, wrote a letter to the Communist Party expressing his concern for the fate of arrested samizdat authors Yuri Galanskov and Alexander Ginzburg. After the letter by Yakhimovich was widely publicized, he was expelled from the Communist Party, arrested and later committed to a psychiatric hospital without trial. In April 1969 former general and dissident Pyotr Grigorenko met with fellow dissidents at his apartment and proposed creating a formal \\"Committee in Defense of Ivan Yakhimovich\\". The proposal elicited mixed reactions: Some dissidents advocated for a broader human rights group, while others doubted the effectiveness of a group over informal expressions of protest, and warned of the significantly harsher crackdowns organized activity would provoke under Anti-Soviet Agitation laws. The disputes came to a close in May, when a report by KGB chairman Yuri Andropov lead to the arrest of Grigorenko. This was followed by the arrest of poet Ilya Gabai, another luminary of the dissident movement.180x180px On 19 May 1969, the day of Ilya Gabai's arrest, a group of dissidents assembled at Pytor Yakir's apartment and agreed to join a proposed human rights group, modelled after the Initiative Groups of Crimean Tatars. As a first action, Victor Krasin drafted an appeal. It enumerated several political trials of the late 1960s, in which defendants were prosecuted for exercising the right to impart information. It was addressed to the United Nations and exhorted it to investigate human rights abuses in the Soviet Union: > We appeal to the United Nations because our protests and complaints, > addressed for a number of years to the higher state and judicial offices in > the Soviet Union, have received no response of any kind. The hope that our > voice might be heard, that the authorities would cease the lawless acts > which we constantly pointed out‚Äîthis hope has been exhausted. Therefore we > appeal to the United Nations, believing that the defense of human rights is > the sacred duty of this organization. The document was signed The Initiative Group for the Defense of Civil Rights in the USSR.After the founding document, the group began to use the name Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR. This designation was followed by the names of fifteen dissidents: The Muscovites Tatyana Velikanova, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Tatyana Khodorovich, Sergei Kovalev, Victor Krasin, Aleksandr Lavut, Anatoly Levitin-Krasnov, Yury Maltsev, Grigory Podyapolsky, Pyotr Yakir and Anatoly Yakobson, Vladimir Borisov from Leningrad, Ukrainians Genrikh Altunyan and Leonid Plyushch, and the Crimean Tatar activist in Uzbekistan Mustafa Dzhemilev. These names were supplemented by a list of 38 supporters. On 20 May 1969, without consulting the other members of the group, Pyotr Yakir and Victor Krasin passed the text to foreign correspondents and a representative of the United Nations in Moscow. Expecting to first discuss the petition and further actions, all fifteen individuals had effectively become members of a new public organization. The members agreed to continue with appeals under that name, on the conditions that no member's name would be used as co-signatory without their express consent.  History   First appeals (1969-1970)  Over the course of 1969, the Initiative Group sent four further letters to the United Nations. In each instance, it appealed for recognition and assistance with the human rights problems in the Soviet Union. Document No. 2 (30 June 1969) was a supplement to its original petition. Written by Natalya Gorbanevskaya and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, it provided information about the case against Anatoly Marchenko and about the use of punitive psychiatry against Ivan Yakhimovich and Pyotr Grigorenko. As the letter reached the West through samizdat distribution and was picked up by shortwave radio stations, the members of the group were interrogated and some arrested. Document No. 3 (26 September 1969) appealed personally to United Nations Secretary General U Thant. It reported the reaction of the Soviet authorities to the first two documents, which included the arrest of four members: Vladimir Borisov, Genrikh Altunyan, Anatoly Levitin-Krasnov, and Mustafa Dzhemilev, and called on U Thant to use his authority and place the violation of human rights in the USSR on the agenda. As the appeal reached the Western media, UN information centers around the world were instructed by its secretariat not to forward petitions to New York. When these appeals to the UN went unanswered, the Initiative Group turned to other recipients: The World Health Organization and the International Congress of Psychiatrists for cases involving punitive psychiatry, the Papacy for the arrest of religious dissenters, news agencies such as Reuters, and simply \\"public opinion\\". By May 1970, six of the fifteen original members of the Initiative group had faced arrest or imprisonment.  Mission statement (1970)  In May 1970 the Initiative Group commemorated its first anniversary with an \\"Open Letter\\" addressed to Reuters and the Soviet press agency. Penned by mathematician Tatyana Velikanova, biologist Sergei Kovalev and poet Anatoly Yakobson, it set out three tenets that guided the group's activity: It aimed not only defend human rights, but by being a group itself assert the formally guaranteed freedom of association; the diverse group was unified by the conviction that \\"the foundation of a normal life of society is recognition of the unconditional value of the human individual\\"; and the group's activity in defense of human rights was not a form of politics: > The Initiative Group has no set program, no bylaws, and no defined > structure. Each of us has the right to abstain from signing a document of > the Group, and each of us has complete freedom when acting in his or her own > name. [...] The Initiative Group does not get involved in politics. We don't > lobby for any specific government measures. We only say: don't violate your > own laws. While we don't engage in politics, we have no intention of > becoming reconciled to the punitive measures directed against dissenters. > Resistance to illegality, to the abuse of power, these are the tasks of the > Initiative Group. The Initiative Group does not believe that it is attacking > the state when it criticizes specific actions of the authorities.Initiative > Group Document No. 6 (May 1970), > http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/ig/docs/igdocs.html In spite of these common goals, the Initiative group was marked by ideological differences. Some, like Sergei Kovalev and Anatoly Yakobson, saw their activity as strictly humanitarian and avoided actions that might be construed as treasonous or anti-Soviet; others like such as Pyotr Yakir, Victor Krasin and Anatoly Levitin-Krasnov, believed that they were engaged in a political struggle with the Soviet regime, and were open to cooperation with the NTS, an √©migr√© anti-communist organization founded in 1930. These disagreements lead Kovalev, Yakobson and Alexander Lavut to threaten that they would leave the Initiative Group.  Case 24 and aftermath (1972-1973)  The members of the Initiative Group were closely linked with other dissident information networks. In April 1968, the samizdat (self-published) bulletin Chronicle of Current Events had begun circulation, reporting violations of civil rights and judicial procedure by the Soviet government and responses to those violations by citizens across the USSR. A succession of the Chronicle's editors came from the ranks of the Initiative Group. In 1972 the KGB initiated Case 24, a wide- ranging crackdown intended to suppress the Chronicle. Three members of the Initiative Group were arrested that year. Leonid Plyushch endured four years of punitive psychiatry until he was released in 1976 and immigrated to the West. Pyotr Yakir and Victor Krasin began to collaborate with their interrogators. In an televised testimony, they recanted their \\"anti-Soviet activity\\" and renounced the Initiative Group as a fraudulent undertaking whose real purpose was the deception of international public opinion. The crackdown reduced the Initiative Group to five members. Between July 1972 and December 1973, the Initiative Group issued only two documents, rejecting the accusations and reporting the conditions and procedure of interrogations. In 1974, it resumed its activity with a steady stream of protests focusing on the plight of inmates of the Gulag and psychiatric hospitals. As a result, a large volume of testimonies about prisons and camps entered the information networks of the movement. Day of the Political Prisoner in the USSR (1974)  In 1974, the Initiative Group organized a \\"Day of the Political Prisoner in the USSR\\". The action had been conceived in the Gulag by astrophysicist Kronid Lyubarsky as part of an ongoing campaign for the recognition of inmates' status as political prisoners. Wives of inmates smuggled information about the planned action out of the Mordovian and Perm labor camps and out of Vladimir prison to the Moscow dissident community. On 30 October 1974, the Initiative Group held a press conference at the apartment of Andrei Sakharov. Speaking before invited foreign correspondents, Sergei Kovalev, Tatyana Velikanova, Tatyana Khodorovich and Alexander Lavut reported the origins of the event in the Gulag and the spectrum of political prisoners in the USSR.\\"Political Prisoner's Day in the USSR\\", A Chronicle of Current Events, 33.1, 10 December 1974. In the name of the Initiative Group, a statement was distributed explaining the origins of the action and contradicting the Soviet regime's claim that it did not have political prisoners. While the press conference was in progress, inmates in Vladimir Prison and in camps in Perm and Mordovia conducted a hunger strike. Kovalev was arrested two months later, and his role in the press conference featured prominently in his interrogations. Nevertheless, the Day of the Political Prisoner became an annual event in the Gulag. In 1991 the annual event was supplanted by Russia's official Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repressions.  End of activities and Moscow Helsinki Group (1976)  By March 1976, of the members of the Initiative Group only Tatyana Velikanova and Tatyana Khodorovich remained at liberty. In November 1977, Khodorovich emigrated to the West. Velikanova continued to sign documents in the name of the Group for another two years, before her arrest in November 1979 marked the formal end of the Initiative Group as a public structure. A final appeal from 17 November 1981 was smuggled out of the women's zone of the Mordovan labor camps. Calling attention to the treatment of infirm and elderly inmates, it was signed by dissident Tatyana Osipova and by Tatyana Velikanova, who described herself as \\"Member of the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR\\". The Initiative Group survived long enough to pass on the baton to other emerging human rights groups in the Soviet Union during the later 1970s. The last statements by its remaining members ‚Äî Grigory Podyapolsky (died 9 March 1976), Tatyana Velikanova, and Tatyana Khodorovich ‚Äî were supported by other dissidents who would become members of the new Moscow Helsinki Group: Yuri Orlov, Malva Landa, and Lyudmila Alekseeva. Established in May 1976, the Moscow Helsinki Group quickly assumed the Initiative Group's role as flagship of the human rights movement in the USSR.

The dam is 67 kilometers northwest of the Kwekwe and 54 km southwest of Kadoma (by air). The Zhombe Communal Land lies to the east of the dam, and the Chief Chisina, Gokwe land is on its west. The dam belongs to the Zhombe East, Kwekwe District, and is one of the 1,620 dams in the Midlands. Dams in this province make up 17% of all dams in Zimbabwe and are managed by ZINWA (Zimbabwe National Water Authority). Background The Ngondoma Dam was constructed in 1967 to supply the Empress Nickel Mine and Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme with water in 1968. It supplies the government managed irrigation scheme 900 000 cubic metres of water per year. Operations The Mapfungautsi Forest in Gokwe is the main drainage basin for surface runoff into the source tributaries of the Ngondoma River. The Ngondoma River has three sources - one in what was known as Ngondoma Crown Land, University of Witwatersrand Institute of Advanced Social Research Seminar Paper, 26 May 1997 located just southwest of the Mapfungautsi Plateau in the Gokwe District, the second from the Chikombera River from the Gokwe end, and the third from the Chebechebe River on the Zhombe side. The Chikombera and Chebechebe rivers were both tributaries of Ngondoma River with the dam being constructed at their confluence. Siltation The initial capacity of Ngondoma at the time of construction was 7 million cubic meters, enough to supply its intended beneficiaries. Siltation is affecting the dam's capacity, but no water shortage has been experienced yet. Ngondoma is an earth-filled dam with a simple Barrage dams mechanism at the far west end of the dam wall. It has an unmanned spillway system with fully automatic flap sluice gates. Some villagers in the catchment areas practice stream bank cultivation and graze their animals in the catchment which leads to erosion upstream of the dam, resulting in siltation. Illegal gold panning upstream, especially on the Zhombe side of Ngondoma River, is also another source of siltation. The Ngondoma Dam is in Zimbabwe's Agro-Ecological Region, where the average annual rainfall is 550 mm. Irrigation is therefore a critical investment in the area. Soil erosion management upstream is lacking and siltation in the Ngondoma reservoir is anticipated to continue. The Environmental Management Authority (EMA) seeks cooperation of villagers and other stakeholders in the catchment area to help alleviate the problem. EMA is taking measures against riverbank saboteurs Beneficiaries The dam provides drinking water for both livestock and people. Apart from the irrigation scheme, the dam waters Empress Mine Growth Point, Columbina RSC, Villages this Zhombe side of the dam and the Gokwe side of it. Legally or illegally, villagers use the dam water for watering gardens, livestock watering, brick moulding and other domestic purposes. Fisheries' co- orperatives have their share in the Ngondoma Dam too, however aquaculture is not practised here even though multiple of fish species have been either caught or spotted in the Ngondoma Dam. Environmental damage Canal water misuse In the case of the Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme, water goes to the scheme from the dam through a 5.8 km gradient-driven open canal. Some villagers illegally take water from the canal to mould bricks and for the irrigation of small gardens along the canal. Some of this water overspills from these illegal gardens back into the Ngondoma River. This behaviour weakens water supply to the scheme yet water leaves the dam outlet full throttle. Fish harvesting Because Ngondoma Dam is in the communal lands, it has open access for fishing, and some illegal fishers overfish have depleted the fish population in the Ngondoma reservoir. Flora Ngondoma Dam is surrounded by a rich flora as on record of the Flora of Zimbabwe. Immediately to the east of the dam has inviting beauty in flora such as the Acacia amythethophylla, Mopane, Euphorbia hirta, Jacaranda mimosifolia, Albizia harveyi, Lantana camara, Senna singueana, Typha capensis and Bauhinia macrantha just to name a few from the 112 records list compiled by Tessa Ball on November 9, 1996.

To address the high infant and maternal death rates in Florida in the 1920s, she lectured and worked at the state health office. Due to her work, training improved for birth attendants and death rates dropped. After 15 years in the state's service, she opened a rural health clinic in Ruskin, Florida, providing both basic nursing services and midwife care. The facility was renamed the Joyce Ely Health Center in her honor in 1954. In 1983, she was inducted into Florida Public Health Association's Hall of Memory and in 2002 was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame. Early life and education Victoria Joyce Ely was born on September 12, 1889, in Flora, Illinois, the eldest child of Cora Lydia (n√©e Hoff) and Harry S. Ely. She graduated from the Carrollton, Illinois, high school and then went to work as a stenographer and bookkeeper. In 1911, she began nursing studies in St. Louis, Missouri, at St. Luke‚Äôs Hospital School for Nurses. Ely earned her nursing diploma in 1915. Career After graduation, she began working at St. Luke's Hospital as ward supervisor and acting assistant superintendent of nurses. She also helped teach other nurses. In 1917, Ely joined the Army nurse Corporation and in May 1917 was placed at the Washington University Base Hospital Unit 21 on the active duty roster. She was mobilized to Rouen, France, for the duration of the war and did not return to the U.S. until June 1919. Upon her return, she entered the Teachers College at Columbia University in New York and undertook a course in Nurse Instruction. Completing her graduate course, she worked for a year as an instructor of nursing in Chicago and joined the American Red Cross. In 1923, Ely was assigned to the Florida Panhandle to provide nursing services in Perry, Florida, at a cypress lumber company. Smallpox, malaria, typhoid, and hookworm were health problems in the mill town at that time and Ely provided vaccinations and basic health care training. Tuberculosis was also a serious threat, as was the lack of sanitary latrines. When Ely arrived, Perry had only one doctor. She began basic hygiene education, working with the state health officers and community leaders. The grateful town gave her a car, a house, and a maid, and she soon spread her teaching efforts to nearby areas. Ely continued in the service of the Red Cross until 1930. The following year, with the passage of the state Midwife Practice Act, Ely was hired by the State Board of Health to head the midwifery training initiative. When she was hired, Florida's maternal death rate was cited at 10.2 per 1,000 births, and the infant mortality rate exceeded 61 per 1000 live births. While the attendance of midwives at births in Florida was 30 percent, more than double that of the rest of the country, and was 50 percent among the state's African American population, no training system was in place for birthing assistants. The more than 3000 women serving as midwives in Florida in the early 1920s were known as \\"granny midwives\\" for their lack of formal training. Ely received a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in 1933 and used it to attend the Lobenstine School of Midwifery in New York. After completing her training, she returned to Florida and became the first licensed midwife in the state. She began a training program and a series of midwifery institutes to deal with the shortage of trained professionals. Many of her seminars were presented to minority groups, as the southern segregation policies created a lack of access to other education as well as adequate health services. She also implemented screening programs to test midwives for communicable diseases. Ely's efforts improved the health standards and maternal safety in Florida. She is credited with declines in both maternal and infant mortality in the period. In 1944 Ely left the state health office and took a position with the Hillsborough County Health Department in Ruskin, Florida. The area was predominantly rural and health care was inaccessible to many residents. Ely established a health clinic in Ruskin, which was the only health care facility in the community, had no doctor, and did not even have running water on site. As she had done previously in Perry, Ely provided immunizations, did health checks, and provided home visits. She issued health cards to certify worker basic health for employment and attended home births. In 1953, a new facility was constructed in Ruskin, and in 1954 the Joyce Ely Health Center was dedicated in her honor. The facility was rebuilt in 1976 and continues to bear her name. Ely retired in 1957 and dedicated her time to gardening. Death and posthumous honors Ely died May 12, 1979, in Ruskin, Florida. Posthumously, she was inducted into Florida Public Health Association's Hall of Memory in 1983 and, in 2002, the Florida Women's Hall of Fame.

First World War photographer The camera of Henry Armytage Sanders in the First World War By December 1916, the public interest in New Zealand for visuals of their troops in the First World War saw the New Zealand Government ask the New Zealand High Commissioner in London, Sir Thomas Mackenzie, to secure the right for New Zealand to appoint an official cameraman.Callister, Sandy. (2008). The face of war: New Zealand's Great War photography. Auckland University Press. On 23 March 1917, Mackenzie replied (via cable) to inform the New Zealand War Office that an official photographer in the name of Henry Armytage Sanders, had been appointed and assigned to the Western Front attached to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force with rank of lieutenant pending the War Office's approval. On 2 April 1917, James Allen, New Zealand Minister of Defense and Acting Prime Minister replied that Sanders was unknown to New Zealand Picture Supplies or any other entity in the picture industry. Mackenzie answered the inquiry and informed Allen that Sanders had worked for the French company Path√© Fr—êres and was a seasoned photographic and cinematographic professional. The terms were: ‚ÄùAll photographic materials to be supplied by New Zealand Government who will have sole rights to all photographs‚Äù. Sanders had already seen action working as the British cameraman for Path√© Gazette in Europe and filmed the war in 1914 when the Germans advanced into Belgium. He had nearly been captured. On 8 March 1917, Sanders enlisted into the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in England. He was married and had 3 children. He was sent to France and met up with the New Zealand Tunnelling Company on 8 April 1917. Sanders took all the NZEF historical photographs and designated these with serial numbers in the H series.Lovell-Smith, Melanie. (July 2014). Photographing New Zealanders at War. New Zealand at War. Ministry for Culture & Heritage. New Zealand WW100. He remained with the NZEF until January 1919, went back to England to be discharged on 8 March 1919, then returned to work for Path√© Fr—êres. Although Sanders was commissioned as a lieutenant and appointed as the New Zealand Official Photographer, there were restrictions imposed by the War Office Cinematographic Committee.Brownlow, K. (1979). The War, the West, and the Wilderness. Alfred A. Knopf. He was briefed on the regulations and the procedure to develop photographs and films, as follows: > 1\\\\.

The building has functioned as a restaurant since its construction in 1690. Its name is derived from Valhalla, the resting place of fallen warriors in Nordic mythology.  Location  The Hotel Walhalla is situated on Bierstra√üe in the Altstadt (old town) area of Osnabr√ºck, in the close proximity of the town hall and market place.  History  In 1690, bailiff Gerdt Heindrich Meuschen built a three-storey, gable-ended half- timbered house on Bierstra√üe. The gables along the ridged roof protrude in a similar manner to the second floor. Meuschen had a medallion added above the entrance portal; alongside this are the familial emblems of the building‚Äôs constructor and his wife Susanne Gertraud (n√©e von Lengerken). The half- timbered consoles are furnished with carved figures of the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John as well as Jesus. The rear side of the building was originally built as a Steinwerk (stone work). There is known to have been a predecessor building, built in 1530, on the site. This was possibly destroyed during the city fire of 1613 ‚Äì in which 900 other houses were destroyed ‚Äì although it may have been taken down to make way for a new building. Meuschen‚Äôs new building was eventually passed on to his daughter and later to his granddaughter ‚Äì both of whom were married to wine merchants. Christian J√§ger, a relative, set up a wine tavern there in 1740, which was visited by numerous city notables and styled the ‚ÄúRatsschenke‚Äù (Council Tavern) on account of its proximity to the town hall. One of its most prominent guests was the 18th century jurist, politician and historian Justus M√∂ser, a native Osnabr√ºcker born in 1720. The house remained family property until the death of J√§ger‚Äôs daughter Marie Gertrud, who was married to the wine merchant Justus Wilhelm Tenge. The first guest rooms were set up in 1820. After the death of Marie Gertrud Tenge, a series of alternating hosts continued to maintain the building as an inn. From 1876 to 1971 the house belonged to the Grabe family, during which time it was intermittently leased. In 1934 a memorial stone was installed on one of the side doors, commemorating the Schnatgang (border walk) of the Heger Laischaft (Heger Farmers‚Äô Group). It bears the following inscription in Low German: ‚ÄûK√ºms du herrut ut d√ºsse durn/Un h√§√üt de M√§se sch√∂n an schl√ºrn/dann stell di hier nich hin un pinkle/sock di datou en ennern Winkel. Snautgang 1934‚Äú. During World War II, the attic was destroyed by an incendiary bomb during the air raids on Osnabr√ºck on 13 September 1944; the rest of the building was, thankfully, able to be saved. For a time the building had to cease its function as a hotel. The building was bought by a merchant in 1985. An adjacent building on the street Kleine Gildewart was attached to the hotel. A renovation of the Hotel Walhalla started that same year; it was completed in 1986. In 1992 the hotel complex was further expanded into two houses on Heger Stra√üe and Kleine Gildewart. One of the buildings had been built in 1616 ‚Äì three years after the city fire of 1613; it is also a listed structure like the main building. Referred to colloquially as the ‚ÄúKatzenhaus‚Äù, this half-timbered building with a half- hipped roof was restored in 1977. The merchant‚Äôs daughter took over the hotel in 1993, which she still runs today along with her husband. It has a total of 66 rooms and 100 beds, and two restaurant and conference rooms.  Guests  Over the course of its history the Hotel Walhalla has welcomed numerous prominent guests from Germany and abroad. Alongside Justus M√∂ser these include Justus Wilhelm Lyra, Albert Lortzing and Erich Maria Remarque. Queen Silvia of Sweden stayed here in 1997; the Dalai Lama visited the following year. 1998 saw the 350th anniversary of the Treaty of Westphalia and on this occasion Queen Silvia and Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, the Norwegian royal couple King Harald V and Sonja, the Danish Queen Margrethe II and Prince Consort Henrik, Belgium‚Äôs King Albert II and Queen Paola, Dutch Queen Beatrix, King Juan Carlos I of Spain along with other ruling couples were guests at the Walhalla. Politicians staying at the hotel included then-Federal President Roman Herzog, the Presidents of Italy, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, along with representatives from other countries. In December 2004, the author Martin Walser wrote about his meetings in Osnabr√ºck and visit to the Hotel Walhalla in an article for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, talking about eating boiled beef and drinking beer ‚Äúas though beer was actually my sort of drink‚Äù.Martin Walser in the weekly newspaper ‚ÄúDie Zeit‚Äù, 9 December 2004  Links  * Website of the Hotel Walhalla  References  Buildings and structures in Osnabr√ºck Hotels in Germany ","title":"Hotel Walhalla"},{"id":"48675958","text":"Facade of San Paolo San Paolo Maggiore, also known as San Paolo Decollato, is a Baroque-style, Roman Catholic basilica church located on Via Carbonari #18 in Bologna, region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy. History Nave towards main altar. The church was commissioned between 1606 and 1611 by the Barnabites from the architect Ambrogio Magenta or Mazenta. Patronage for this church was mainly derived from the Prince Virgilio Spada, brother of Cardinal Bernardino Spada. The Barnabites, also known as the Clerics Regular of St Paul, named this church as Maggiore to distinguish it from two other San Paolo's in Bologna. Between 1634 and 1636 the facade was built to designs by Ercole Fichi. The facade, in brick and stone, has statues of St Peter and Paul, respectively by Domenico Maria Mirandola and G. Cruventi.Guida storico- statistica monumentale dell'Italia (1857) page 287. During the Napoleonic invasion, the Barnabites were suppressed, and the church was made a parish church in 1819. Closed again later, it was reconsecrated in 1878. In 1959 it was restored to the Barnabites, and two years later raised to the designation of Minor Basilica by pope John XIII.Bologna sacra: tutte le chiese in due millenni di storia, by Marcello Fini, page 177.

It was founded in 1977 as part of a wave of foundations across New Zealand in the early to mid 1970s. Their work includes advocacy, education for public and counselling for survivors. In 2008 Wellington Rape Crisis received charitable status from the Charities Commission. Advocacy Wellington Rape Crisis advocates against sexual violence and rape culture. In 2012, pizza company Hell Pizza faced controversy when they ran a \\"Confessional\\" competition on Facebook. The winner described an incident of sexual assault where he put his penis inside the mouth of a drunk person who was passed out. This was met with a huge number of complaints and criticisms across Facebook and Twitter. Hell Pizza blamed a social media manager and removed the post. However they subsequently donated $10,000 to Wellington Rape Crisis and matched donations made to the agency that month dollar for dollar. At the time Wellington Rape Crisis were being forced to cut services, closing their doors on Fridays due to a $55,000.00 funding shortfall. Wellington Rape Crisis experienced an increase in client numbers and were faced with a difficult funding environment. The funding was accepted by the agency on the condition that Hell Pizza's executives, staff and managers do sexual violence awareness and bystander intervention training provided by the Sexual Abuse Prevention Network. News of the Roast Busters scandal first broke in November 2013. A group of young men based in Auckland allegedly intoxicated underage girls to gang rape them. The lack of police response to the issue and the line of questioning they took when interviewing the complainants sparked a large public outcry. Wellington Rape Crisis condemned the behavior of the young boys as abhorrent and denounced the rape culture in New Zealand. Agency Manager Natalie Gousmett said: > This whole situation is horrific. First we have the abhorrent behavior of > the members of the rape group, causing serious harm to the victims they have > targeted. Then we have appalling coverage by media, including extreme > victim-blaming and today we have heard the Police have indeed had complaints > yet have only just started taking action now. In November 2015 New Zealand Prime Minister John Key accused the opposition party of ‚ÄúBacking rapists.‚Äù In response to these claims several female MPs stood up and shared their own experiences of sexual violence and voiced their offence to the Prime Minister's comments. They were subsequently thrown out of Parliament by the Speaker of the House. Spokesperson for Wellington Rape Crisis Eleanor Butterworth said the Prime Minister's comments were not helpful. She said ‚ÄúIt was not only harmful for survivors to have rape used as a political football, but also for the families of people who have been sexually abused.

They coincided with the Anglo-Spanish war of 1739. Privateering by the British was common during this conflict and the attacks on Fuerteventura in 1740 can be seen as an extension of this period of discord between Britain and Spain.  Background and wider war  The \\"War of Jenkins' Ear\\", so called in reference to the severed ear of a British captain, was a conflict between Britain and Spain that lasted from 1739 to 1748. Although the conflict officially ended in 1748, the main engagements were concluded by 1742. Although this article deals only with two such attacks by privateers on one side, privateering occurred on both sides during the conflict.  Attacks   First attack  The two pirate attacks on Fuerteventura in 1740 occurred within a month of one another. The first involved a band of 50 men who landed in the bay at Gran Tarajal and marched inland to the village of Tuineje. While they looted Tuineje, the pirates were unaware that the island militia were mustering their troops in defence of the island. This was not the first pirate attack on Fuerteventura, and the island had been fortified against such attacks by towers at Caleta de Fuster and Toston. The military commander of the island, Lieutenant Colonel Jos√© S√°nchez Umpi√©rrez, and captain Melchor Cabrera Bethencourt led the militia against the invading British pirates. The defence of the island was both brutal and effective; of the 50 privateers, 30 were killed while 20 more were taken prisoner. The islanders, according to George Glas, attacked the invading English with clubs and stones. To shield themselves from the musket fire of the pirates, the locals hid behind a wall of camels. The prisoners were shipped to Tenerife.  Second attack  The exact time between each attack varies- Glas places it at six weeks, while John Mercer says one month; whatever the precise time that elapsed between each attack, both were carried out in a similar fashion within a short time of one another. It is thought that the second attack was launched by a larger group of privateers- Glas places the number as 200 to 300 men. Again, as had happened on the first attack, the pirates landed on the bay in Gran Tarajal and again, with drums and banners, marched to the village of Tuineje to loot. There is a dispute about the exact number of pirates who launched the second attack, and the precise number killed. John Mercer, in his 1973 book on Fuertevenrura, says that the locals killed \\"fifty[pirates] on the spot\\". This would challenge Glas's claim that 200 to 300 attacked on the second time. Whatever the actual number, it is accepted that the second attack was put down with far more brutality and less pity. It would seem that all involved were killed, with no prisoners taken like on the first attack. Glas notes in his writings that, owing to the audacity of launching a second attack in such a short time frame, the locals were in no mood to show leniency. \\"The natives, enraged to find the island disturbed again in so short a time, determined to give these second invaders no quarter..\\" - George Glas: The History of the Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands.

Scientists in the field refer to this massive data collection as the social genome, denoting the collective digital footprint of our society. Population informatics applies data science to social genome data to answer fundamental questions about human society and population health much like bioinformatics applies data science to human genome data to answer questions about individual health. It is an emerging research area at the intersection of SBEH (Social, Behavioral, Economic, & Health) sciences, computer science, and statistics in which quantitative methods and computational tools are used to answer fundamental questions about our society. Data Science Bioinformatics Population Informatics  Introduction   History  The term was first used in August 2012 when the Population Informatics Lab was founded at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The term was first defined in a peer reviewed article in 2013 and further elaborated on in another article in 2014. The first Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in August 2015.  Goals  To study social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences using the massive data collections, aka social genome data, about people. The primary goal of population informatics is to increase the understanding of social processes by developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to the social genome data. Some of the important sub-disciplines are : * Business analytics * Social computing: social network data analysis * Policy informatics * Public health informatics * Computational journalism * Computational transportation science * Computational epidemiology * Computational economics * Computational sociology * Computational social science  Approaches  Record Linkage, the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources, is a major activity in the population informatics field because most of the digital traces about people are fragmented in many heterogeneous databases that need to be linked before analysis can be done. Once relevant datasets are linked, the next task is usually to develop valid meaningful measures to answer the research question. Often developing measures involves iterating between inductive and deductive approaches with the data and research question until usable measures are developed because the data were collected for other purposes with no intended use to answer the question at hand. Developing meaningful and useful measures from existing data is a major challenge in many research projects. In computation fields, these measures are often called features. Finally, with the datasets linked and required measures developed, the analytic dataset is ready for analysis. Common analysis methods include traditional hypothesis driven research as well more inductive approaches such as data science and predictive analytics.  Relation to other fields  Computational social science refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena. Fields include computational economics and computational sociology. The seminal article on computational social science is by Lazer et al. 2009 which was a summary of a workshop held at Harvard with the same title. However, the article does not define the term computational social science precisely. In general, computational social science is a broader field and encompasses population informatics. Besides population informatics, it also includes complex simulations of social phenomena. Often complex simulation models use results from population informatics to configure with real world parameters. Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) is another similar field coming about. But again, DSSG is a bigger field applying data science to any social problem that includes study of human populations but also many problems that do not use any data about people. Population reconstruction is the multi-disciplinary field to reconstruct specific (historical) populations by linking data from diverse sources, leading to rich novel resources for study by social scientists.  Related groups and workshops  The first Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in 2015. The workshop brought together computer science researchers, as well as public health practitioners and researchers. This Wikipedia page started at the workshop. The International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN) facilitates communication between centres that specialize in data linkage and users of the linked data. The producers and users alike are committed to the systematic application of data linkage to produce community benefit in the population and health-related domains.  Challenges  Three major challenges specific to population informatics are: # Preserving privacy of the subjects of the data ‚Äì due to increasing concerns of privacy and confidentiality sharing or exchanging sensitive data about the subjects across different organizations is often not allowed. Therefore, population informatics need to be applied on encrypted data or in a privacy-preserving setting.Dinusha Vatsalan, Peter Christen, and Vassilios S.

Films In Birdland In 1907, Sanders teamed with natural history photographer and filmmaker Oliver Gregory Pike for the pioneering nature film production, In Birdland. The film was the first British wildlife film to be screened to a paying audience. In August 1907, In Birdland premiered at London's Palace Theatre of Varieties. The initial screening of the film was so successful, an additional 100 copies were made. Due to the popularity and demand, this would allow the film to be screened in cinemas throughout the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, none of the copies remain to this day as they were either subsequently lost or destroyed.Editor. (2015). Sanders & Crowhurst. History Librarium. Historic Camera.Editor. (2015).

The photographic team of Pike and Sanders employed groundbreaking techniques and jeopardised themselves as they took their cameras over coastal cliffs and dangled from ropes to capture a glimpse into the environment of Great Britain's seabirds. The rarely captured or seen film footage introduced the viewing audience into the intimate lives of kittiwakes, gannets, cormorants and puffins. Guillemots Guillemots.
