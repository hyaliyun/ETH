In 1996, he co- founded the Zen Peacemaker Order with his late wife Sandra Jishu Holmes. Glassman was a Dharma successor of the late Taizan Maezumi-roshi, and gave inka and Dharma transmission to several people. Glassman was known as a pioneer of social enterprise, socially engaged Buddhism and \\"Bearing Witness Retreats\\" at Auschwitz and on the streets with homeless people. According to author James Ishmael Ford, in 2006 he Biography Bernie Glassman was born to Jewish immigrants in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York in 1939. He attended university at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and received a degree in engineering. Following graduation he moved to California to work as an aeronautical engineer at McDonnell-Douglas. He then received his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles. Glassman first encountered Zen when he was assigned Huston Smith's The Religions of Man for an English class in 1958. From there, he continued reading including books by Alan Watts, Christmas Humphreys, and D.T. Suzuki. In the early 1960s, Glassman began meditating and soon after sought a local Zen teacher. He found Taizan Maezumi in Los Angeles, California and Glassman became one of the original founding members of the Zen Center of Los Angeles. He received Dharma transmission in 1976 from Maezumi and then inka in 1995 shortly before Maezumi's death. In 1980, he founded the Zen Community of New York. In 1982 Glassman opened Greyston Bakery in Yonkers, New York, which initially provided jobs for the Zen students and evolved into an effort to help alleviate the widespread homelessness in the area. The bakery provided jobs for inner city residents who lacked education and skills. Greyston employed low-skilled workers from the neighborhood, many of whom were homeless themselves, and sold baked goods to shops and restaurants in Manhattan. In 1989 Glassman entered an agreement with Ben & Jerry's, and Greyston Bakery has become the supplier of brownies for several lines of ice cream. Through the success of his bakery‚Äìwhich in 2016 was earning $12 million in revenues‚ÄìGlassman founded the Greyston Foundation (sometimes called Greyston Mandala) with his wife Sandra Jishu Holmes in 1989. He retired from the Greyston Foundation in 1996 to pursue socially engaged Buddhist projects through the Zen Peacemakers. As of 2004 the Foundation had developed $35 million worth in real estate development projects in Westchester County, New York. The Foundation offers HIV/AIDS programs, provides job training and housing, child care services, educational opportunities, and other endeavors. In 2003 the bakery moved to a new building, which allows for higher output and more employment opportunities. In 1996 Glassman, with his wife Sandra Jishu Holmes, founded the Zen Peacemaker Order. According to professor Christopher S. Queen, \\"The order is based on three principles: plunging into the unknown, bearing witness to the pain and joy of the world, and a commitment to heal oneself and the world.\\" Richard Hughes Seager writes, \\"The Zen Peacemaker Order...has the potential to rival Thich Nhat Hanh's groups and the Buddhist Peace Fellowship as a force in American activism.\\" Glassman died on November 4, 2018 from complications of a stroke in Springfield, Massachusetts at the age of 79.Bernie Glassman Passes Away Teachings Bernie Glassman with Elihu Genmyo Smith Glassman taught about what his teacher, the late Taizan Maezumi, called the \\"unknowing.\\" Not- knowing is the first tenet of the Zen Peacemakers, and Glassman said of it, \\"In Zen the words source and essence are the equivalent of Unknowing, and they come up again and again. We have the absolute and the relative perspectives about life, and Unknowing is the one source of both of these.\\" Also, Glassman was known for his many \\"street retreats.\\" Author James Ishmael Ford writes, \\"...'street retreats,' for instance, moves sesshin into the streets: participants eat in soup kitchens, and, if they know they're not displacing homeless people, sleep in homeless shelters or, otherwise, sleep in public places. Zazen takes place in parks.\\" In the 2000s, Glassman developed an experiment in sociocratic consensus-based zen training and interfaith facilitation, known initially as Peacemaker Circle International,Eve Marko, in Women Practicing Buddhism: American Experiences by Peter Gregory and Susanne Mrozik (1998, Wisdom Books US), p114 and later Zen Peacemaker Circles. Interconnected projects were established globally,http://ukzenpeacemakers.blogspot.com replacing the role of 'Zen teacher' with participants learning from each other and sharing ideas between Circles.https://michaelstoneteaching.com/2014/10/11/bernie-glassman-2-the- circles-are-us/ In his last years, having disrobed from the priesthood, Glassman together with his third wife Eve Marko continued the work of his teacher Koryu Osaka Roshihttps://cdn.reference-zenhub.org/koryu_osaka.html in developing lay forms of Zen practice. Lineage Zen Center of Los Angeles Bernie Glassman appointed several \\"senseis\\"Sanbo Kyodan: Harada-Yasutani School of Zen Buddhism and its Teachers and \\"roshis\\" in traditional zen, and established the non-hierarchical roles of 'Steward' and 'Circle Dharmaholder' as coordinators and visionholders to continue the Zen Peacemaker Circles model.

It is the sole, licensed, statutory provider and is operated directly by the city. The Service is an independent third service provider. This means that it is part of the Emergency and Protective Services department of the city but functions as an independent and separate agency from other services. The Ottawa Paramedic Service operates in compliance with legislation and licensing standards overseen by the government of Ontario. It also provides routine, non-emergency transports and emergency paramedic coverage for special events. It is the only service provider permitted to service medical emergency calls in the City of Ottawa. History The first known Ottawa (called By-Town) hospital was created in 1827 by Lt. Col. John By who was commissioned to build the canal and join the Ottawa river with Lake Ontario. This military hospital most likely had some form of ambulance, but no records or documentation can support its use. The population of Ottawa was only a few thousand, and it did not have an ambulance service since no general hospital existed. Early diseases and first hospital Communicable diseases, mostly malaria, cholera, influenza, typhus and smallpox were common causing the religious community to ask Montreal Grey Nuns for assistance in establishing a permanent hospital in By-Town. Elizabeth Bruyere opened the Ottawa General hospital on May 10, 1845. Located at 169 St. Patrick Street, it contained 7 beds. Their first patient transport was completed by the sisters on the same day, a 40-year-old tubercular patient who was brought in on a hand cart two pushing and two pulling. Mother Bruyere faced her first typhus outbreak in 1847, which led to the construction of an emergency hospital. Many Irish immigrants in that year were escaping Great Famine of Ireland, and searching for work on the Rideau Canal. More than 3,000 Irish immigrants passed through Ottawa in that year, causing disease rates to skyrocket. In this outbreak 172 patients of the 532 patients died. Even more devastating were 17 out of 21 nurses became infected while providing care but were able to recover. Mother Bruyere and the sisters would remove the deceased to the graveyard at night and bury them so that the residents would not be alarmed by the devastation Ottawa's outbreaks caused. This placed an enormous strain on Ottawa's infant health care system. Mother Bruyere dealt with three decades of severe outbreaks, traumas, and poverty in Ottawa; she died at 58 years on April 5, 1876, her selfless dedication, devotion to her faith and the Citizens of Ottawa is unsurpassed. City of Ottawa involvement The first known ambulance reference is in the City of Ottawa by-laws and was possibly enforced earlier than 1890. It was written that police could use any for hire wagon to ‚Äúassist in the conveyance of any person to hospital or elsewhere as may be required, who may be wounded or met with accident, or who may have been suddenly taken ill, provided the sickness is not infectious in nature, and such owner or driver shall be entitled after the performance of such service to the usual fare therefore from the proper authorities‚Äù This implies that any taxi, wagon, or cart was used by police to move patients around. This method would have been most effective in the early years since officers patrolled the streets and would have been notified of any traumatic or accidental emergency. Ottawa's first public ambulance The first designated and public ambulance operator was the Women‚Äôs Humane Society (Ottawa Humane Society)that began service shortly after their inception in 1888. Seeing a need in the Ottawa community, a hand ambulance was purchased for the conveyance of injured persons and children. In their first few years as a society, the scope included: ‚ÄúWe believe it to be our duty bettering the lot of neglected children by urging legislation to provide foster homes; supervising the overhaul of Ottawa‚Äôs only ambulance; and stirring up the public conscience to the fair treatment of all animals..‚Äù In addition to their hand ambulance, they also became advocates for heroism and first aid resources. Each year, awards for Bravery were given out to members of the public who put their lives in danger for another. The Ottawa Humane Society also raised funds to have large waterproof banners with resuscitation instructions and rescue buoys were put in the most frequent drowning sites. In under ten years, it was clear that providing ambulance services for the City of Ottawa was too large of a service for the Humane Society. With the final report given on the condition of their ambulance, the hand ambulance was donated in 1895 to the City of Ottawa's fleet under the care of Mr. McKinstry of Queen Street. The City of Ottawa accepted on October 6, 1890, to purchase a contagious disease ambulance (similar time frame to Women's Humane Society donating their ambulance). Medical Health Board wrote to the council, ‚ÄúThe time has arrived when the City should own and control such means of conveyance‚Äù. Records suggest that the City of Ottawa owned the disease ambulance that became associated with the Strathcona Hospital and was used only for contagious disease cases. The horse- drawn ambulance was relieved of service in 1919 after Ottawa faced the 1918 Influenza Epidemic and was replaced by a much needed motorized ambulance. This vehicle was staffed with nursing students out of the Civic hospital and they attended the patients while a 'skilled chauffeur' was in charge of driving. This vehicle was not sent on emergencies with lights and sirens activated, but it was considered an ambulance. This vehicle was replaced again in the 1930s with a Hudson 8 ambulance. This vehicle was then taken out of service when the Strathcona Hospital closed. Funeral homes come to Ottawa's aid Each year the City of Ottawa would ask for tenders to provide ambulance service for emergency calls excluding contagious disease cases. A variety of offers would come in showing the vast interest in providing ambulance service, but it also showed a lack of direction since the lowest tender was almost always the one taken. Alphonse Julien, Woodburn, Gauthier, Landreville, Hulse, Brady and Harris, Whelan, Tubman, A.E. Veitch, Geo. B. Burney, Rogers, McEvoy, Radmore and Stewart, Rancine, and Fred N. Garrett funeral services were all known to bid on these contracts or offer private ambulance service for the residents of Ottawa from as early as 1898 to almost 1968. Other potential ambulance operators were Louis Duhamel a carriage maker turn of the century and ambulance mechanic, Medric Landreville (son of Joseph Landreville who owned Landreville Funeral Home) and Peter Shorkey operated taxi services in the 1930s as well as ambulance services. Arthur Wilson Ambulance Service provided service for a short period of time. These services valiantly took on the task of providing ambulance care, but with unpaid accounts, lack of accountability and few resources, each provider amalgamated, discontinued ambulance service and sold their equipment to the next generation of ambulance providers. The next generation of ambulance providers were now primarily in the business of ambulance care instead of it being a secondary operation. There was a wide range of success for these services most notably were Exclusive Ambulance Service and Twin City Ambulance Service. Queensway Ambulance Service and Arthur Wilson Ambulance Services both existed for short periods of time, but very little to no information has survived to today. Exclusive Ambulance began in 1948 when Eric Magladry returned home post war to find his wife Edith Magladry had purchased an ambulance service from three interns working out of the Civic Hospital. Living on 338 Somerset Street with the garage below, they began providing ambulance services to Ottawa. In 1955 the City of Ottawa renewed their contract with Exclusive ambulance after stating they had received satisfactory service. At this time they had three ambulances and charged five dollars per call. In 1961 the service was moved to 61 Louisa, possibly for expansion. This move was followed almost immediately by another when Louisa Street (and other nearby) residents were expropriated for the first Ottawa Urban Renewal Project ‚Äì the building of the Queen Elizabeth Way (the 'Queensway' or Highway 417). The Magladry family and Exclusive Ambulance was moved to 71 Le Breton Street in November 1965, the property being sold for $42,500 and no renumeration was given to relocate Ottawa's largest ambulance service. Eric was forced to go farther in debt to support his business since many accounts went unpaid. Eric offered hospital bed delivery, home oxygen supplies, transfers, body removal and other medical equipment needs to citizens in order to offset the debt incurred by completing ambulance calls. Eric reported to the Ottawa Journal in 1964 that 40% of his accounts are unpaid. Every attendant that worked for Eric speaks of his dedication to his patients as well as his business. Eric Magladry created uniforms, codes and other protocols to provide a better standard of care for the citizens of Ottawa. In 1966 the City of Ottawa renewed their contract with Exclusive. Listed in this contract were 7 vehicles. All are specially designed ambulances on Cadillac chassis. (4-1954, 1‚Äì1955, 2-1956 models) Exclusive has 20 members on staff and all have St. John's Ambulance Certificates and attend annual refresher courses. Twin City Ambulance Service Gordon Hiscoe and his wife Valeda Hiscoe purchased a home at 95 Selkirk in Eastview (now called Vanier). In the early 1950s, Gordon witnessed a pedestrian struck by a vehicle. By no fault of their own, Exclusive Ambulance being a west end service took over 45 minutes to respond to the dying patient. After seeing the need for more ambulance services, Gordon felt it was his moral responsibility to the general public to provide care and transportation for these patients. Gordon hired a variety of employees, volunteer firefighters, orderlies at the hospitals, nurses and anyone else who expressed interest in the service. All modifications were done through an Ottawa company or done in the garage at 95 Selkirk. No standard for how these vehicles should be altered existed at this time, Gordon and Ed had vehicles altered to meet their needs. The dynamics of the emergency call varied from service to service, with Twin City, they had a ‚Äòdriver‚Äô and the ‚Äòattendant‚Äô. The driver was always more senior, because payment occurred when the patient arrived at hospital. Any first aid treatments were secondary to this. Minimal extrication equipment existed, so the patient would be taken out of the building on the stretcher regardless of the number of stairs (differing greatly from today, when we now have other means of moving patients to the stretcher). Injuries in ambulance attendants was frequent and often untreated. Queensway Ambulance Service started in 1959 at 827 Campbell Avenue by Bryan W. Fuller. After only five years Bryan reported to the Ottawa Journal that in 1963 his yearly income was $16,203 representing a net loss. He stated that police and fire departments would act as ambulances, passersby would remove patients and that 33% of all his medical calls were uncollectable. Bryan operates 2 vehicles and employed 15 men in this timeframe. On July 5, 1964, his vehicle was dispatched to a motor vehicle collision they lost control and collided with the 417 overpass at Woodroffe. Bryan W. Fuller was sent to hospital with potential internal injuries and his partner was Warren Cushman was treated and released. After this incident, Bryan sold his remaining assets to Twin City Ambulance and pursued other employment. Both Twin City and Exclusive Ambulance Services responded to the Heron Bridge Collapse on August 10, 1966. Both services worked tirelessly to help treat and account for all victims involved. Provincial changes for Ontario The first Ambulance Act entitled, ‚ÄúAn Act to promote Ambulance Services and improve their Standards‚Äù was created in the fiscal year of 1966-1967 and was a five-page document that was the conceptual framework for an evolving ambulance service system in Ontario. This enabling legislation allowed the Minister of Health and that department the legal ability to begin creating and assessing the needs of Ontario's ambulance response. The Act contained basic information to begin regulating ambulance services such as definitions of terms and levels of authority. This Act would effect all forms of ambulance services in Ontario regardless of ownership. The Ontario Hospital Services Commission was created within the provincial government to oversee the transition of ambulance services into a standardized system. These changes were spearheaded by Dr. Norman McNally-who has been named \\"the Father of EMS in Ontario\\". On July 1, 1968, all Ontario ambulance services became part of the Ontario Hospital Services Commission (Ministry of Health and Long Term Care). Persons insured with O.H.S.C are entitled to use an ambulance will only be required to pay 25% of the scheduled rates. This transition as a whole was positive for the workforce of attendants. A transition that demanded better equipment, pay, standards of care and ensured proper ambulances would be used to transport patients instead of homemade vehicles. These changes came at the expense of the Hiscoe and MaGladry families who spent all their time and money to provide ambulance care. By the end of the transition phase in 1974 Ottawa Ambulance Service was purchased by the newly formed Ambulance Services Branch of the Ministry of Health and all the employees became Crown Agents. By 1975 the Ambulance Act was updated to contain the new standardized criteria for employment with a service as well as the service and its equipment. Ottawa Ambulance Service continued to operate from 1975 to 1984 when the service name was changed to \\"Ottawa-Carleton Regional Ambulance Service\\". This name remained the same until 2001. In 1984 changes occurred in the periphery of Ottawa. Areas such as Orleans, Kanata, Osgoode, Richmond and Barrhaven expanded quickly and required better ambulance coverage. Bases and contracts were drawn up creating the following five privately owned ambulance services that also responded to Ottawa: Rockland Orleans Ambulance Service: Orleans base opened in November 1984 (was briefly owned by Ottawa) and was owned by Bernard Thivierge. Arnprior-Kanata Ambulance Service: Kanata base opened in November 1984 and was owned by Doug Powell. Carleton Place-Richmond Ambulance Service: Richmond base opened in 1981 due to local pressure for better coverage. This service was owned by Mr. Alan Barker of Carleton Place. St. Lawrence and District Ambulance Service: This service owned or operated the Barrhaven post (1984) and Nepean post (1984). Although once the hunt club bridge became operational, the Nepean post was closed and SLDAS took over the Queensway Carleton Hospital ambulance base. This service was run by Mr. Ron Dalgleish until July 21, 1997 when it was sold to Rural Metro who ran the service until 2001. Osgoode and District Ambulance Service: This service was opened in April 1988 under a contract with St Lawrence and District Ambulance Service. Rural Metro owned this service for a period of a few months until it went to tender again. Then the service was owned by Eastern Medical Services (created and owned by Doug Powell, Jim McIsaac and Michel Chretien) until 2001. Ottawa EMS The Ottawa EMS-SMU came into existence on January 1, 2001, when six separate agencies providing Ambulance and Paramedic care to the then Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton were amalgamated into one service. St. Lawrence & District Ambulance Services in Nepean, Ontario (SLDAS), Ottawa Carleton Regional Ambulance Service in Ottawa (OCRAS), Rockland/Orleans in Orleans, Ontario (ROAS), Carleton Place/Richmond in Richmond, Ontario, Kanata/Arnprior Ambulance in Kanata, Ontario, and Eastern Medical in Osgoode, Ontario, all became the Ottawa Paramedic Service. In 2003 the city also assumed control of the communications centre which was, at that time, run by a third party for the Government of Ontario. Queen Street, during the 2007 Remembrance Day ceremonies in Ottawa. In front of the ambulance is a St. John's Ambulance van. In the 1980s better ambulances and equipment became the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care's priority. In the 1990s, semi-automatic Defibrillators and Symptom relief medications administration became the norm for paramedic Scope of practice. Due primarily to local grassroots efforts (Action Paramedic led by the ACT Foundation), political pressure and a research program called the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support Studies (OPALS) Ottawa was the first center in Ontario to be selected to introduce fully trained Advanced Care Paramedics (ACP) as part of a Ministry of Health province-wide project. As we know them today ACPs have been in Ottawa since 1995. Various Advanced Life Support (ALS) response programs had been developed and implemented with much less success over the past 40 years throughout Ontario. Until 2001, Ottawa had never had a single agency provide comprehensive ACP paramedic treatment in the community. Prior to then it was typically several services operating under a single communications radio network offering only primary care paramedic (PCP) level of treatment and response. The Ottawa Paramedic Service is part of a larger city department comprising Ottawa By-law Services, Corporate Security and Emergency Management and Ottawa Fire Services. Like many other models the Paramedic Service and Fire Service are sister agencies within a single department, distinct but culturally separate. A single department overseen by a General Manager with a Paramedic Chief and a Fire Chief each with their mandate serving residents and the community. Service The service is a structured hierarchy with a clearly defined rank system conforming to a national and provincial paramedic visual identity. The Paramedic Chief is the most senior leader in the Service and is responsible for the overall effective operation of the Ottawa Paramedic Service. The office of the chief is the most senior administrative body within the branch. Under this office the service is organized into four broad functional groups called divisions. All divisions report to the Chief. Each division is further divided into sections of operational work areas. Sections may be divided into teams, units or in the case of larger sections, such as in the Operations Division, platoons. Divisions are led by a Deputy Chief, Sections by Commanders and units, teams or platoons are led by Superintendents. The Chief, Deputy Chiefs, Commanders and Superintendents together are the formal leadership team of the service. The Service Executive Team (the Executive) is composed of the service's most senior staff including the Chief and the divisional deputies. The Senior Management Team (SMT) comprises the Executive and all command staff (the Commanders). Commanders can be responsible for 6 to 10 Superintendents and overall up to 120 staff in total. Superintendents are the front line supervisors of the service and, depending on their role, can be responsible for from 6 to 24 personnel each. * Operations Division - Led by a Paramedic Deputy Chief the division is divided into four sections (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta) which are led by a Commander with five platoons, each led by Superintendents * Communications Division - Is divided into two sections, each led by a Commander including Communications Operations (Medical Dispatch) and Performance Management * Technical Services Division - Led by a Paramedic Deputy Chief the division is divided into three sections, each led by a Commander including Logistics, Quality Assurance and the training and development section * Special Operations Division - Led by a Paramedic Deputy Chief along with two Commanders is responsible for: Paramedic Bike Unit, Paramedic Tactical Unit, USAR [urban search and rescue], Public Support Unit, the Paramedic Marine Unit, the Ottawa Medical Venturer Unit (MedVent) and is also responsible for contingency, special event and emergency planning as well as Community Medicine Personnel * 1 Chief * 4 Deputy Chiefs * 12 Commanders * 40 Superintendents (Operations, Clinical Training, Logistics, Communications, Professional Standards, Quality Review and Public Information) * 70 Communications Officers * 8 Administrative support personnel (including Quality Assurance/Improvement Clerks, Program Performance Analysts, Administrative Assistants and other non-uniformed personnel) * 44 Equipment and Supply Technicians * 1 Biomedical Engineer * 12 Public Education Officers * 440 Advanced and Primary Care Paramedics (sub-specialties of Marine, Tactical, USAR, CBRNE as well as others) Fleet A paramedic outside the Treatment and Rehabilitation Unit, during the Remembrance Day ceremonies in Ottawa * 86 Paramedic Units (Type III) - Demers Ambulances Myst√®re MX160A (on Ford E-Series chassis), all equipped with Stryker Power Load * 1 Emergency Support Unit (Ford F650/PK Bodies) * 1 Neonatal Transfer Unit (Type III with Stryker Power Load) * 1 Bariatric Patient Vehicle (Modified Type III) * 7 Supervisor Response Vehicles (Ford Explorer Police Interceptors) * 12 Paramedic Response Units (Ford Taurus and Ford Explorer Police Interceptors) * 22 Bicycles * 1 Truck and Trailer (Ford F-Series) * 2 Off Road Rescue Units (4x4 ASAP Units) * 1 Treatment and Rehabilitation Unit (Nova Bus LFS) * 2 Emergency Shelter trailers * 2 Multi-Casualty Incident (disaster supplies) trailers Facilities *Headquarters Campus - Located at 2495 Don Reid Drive in Ottawa (The first LEED-certified building in the city) *The campus - Is divided into two distinct areas with separate buildings. One building houses the Paramedic Communications Centre (2475 Don Reid), the Ministry of Health Field Office and the Regional Paramedic Program for Eastern Ontario (RPPEO, the base Hospital). The second building is the administrative and operational centre for all Paramedic Service operations. This building serves as the single start station for all urban paramedic operations in the city *Paramedic Posts - 16 strategically located throughout the city for paramedic personnel to have down time between calls *Combined Services Facilities - 8 facilities located in sub-urban and rural areas. The Emergency and Protective Services (EPS) combined services buildings house part-time fire service personnel and full-time Paramedics. These combined service Paramedic Posts were report to work locations outside of the urban core and are shared with other city staff such as police and fire. They are now used the same as Paramedic Posts with indoor facilities. Level of care *Note: The Paramedic Service is the only licensed agency in Ottawa that employs and responds certified paramedics.

EUI is designated as an international organisation. It is located in the hills of Florence, Italy. In 2020, EUI's School of Transnational Governance, with its flagship graduate and executive program, will move to the Casino Mediceo di San Marco, which is a late-Renaissance or Mannerist style palace in the historic center of Florence. History and member states The European University Institute (EUI) was founded in 1972 by the Member States of the European Community. The EUI finds its origins in the advocacy for a European institute at the 1948 Hague Conference and the European Cultural Conference the following year. At the 1955 Messina Conference, when the members of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) gathered to assess that organisation's progress, the German Secretary of State Walter Hallstein called for the establishment of a training centre for nuclear sciences. The idea remained largely dormant until 1969 when European leaders met in The Hague and resolved to fund a European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. By this point the idea had evolved from a centre for nuclear sciences to one focused on the human sciences, promoting a cultural exchange between member states. Plans were put into motion with conferences in Florence and Rome in 1970 and 1971, when it was decided that the institute would be reserved for post- graduate studies and not directly a Community institution. The six member states ‚Äì Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands ‚Äì signed a convention in 1972 establishing the EUI as a pillar for research and development. The EUI Convention entered into force in 1975, and the Instituted opened its doors to its first 70 researchers in 1976. Its mission, laid down in the 1970s, is to ‚Äúfoster the advancement of learning in fields which are of particular interest for the development of Europe‚Äù. Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the European Community in 1973, and subsequently acceded to the convention establishing the EUI. In 1992, a new convention revising the 1972 convention establishing the EUI was signed by the then 12 Community member states. It entered into force in 2007 when the last contracting state ratified the Convention. , the EUI member states are: * Austria * Belgium * Bulgaria * Cyprus * Denmark * Estonia * Finland * France * Germany * Greece * Ireland * Italy * Latvia * Luxembourg * Malta * Netherlands * Poland * Portugal * Romania * Slovakia * Slovenia * Spain * Sweden * United Kingdom The remaining EU member states which are not EUI member states are: Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Lithuania . Departments and centres Department of Economics The Economics Department provides teaching and supervision to PhD students. The research activities of the Department reflect the interests of the faculty and are concentrated in micro, macro and econometrics. Weekly research seminars are given by scholars from around the world. The teaching in the doctoral programme is based on formal coursework at a level which will allow researchers to pursue academic careers in universities or to follow professional opportunities in international organisations. In their third and fourth years researchers work on their thesis projects under the guidance of their supervisor while attending research workshops and seminars. Department of History and Civilization The Department of History and Civilization (HEC) offers a programme of transnational and comparative European history. The doctoral programme studies the construction of Europe's boundaries and the diversity and complexity of experiences within them. The department's central concerns are the interlinking of European societies since the Renaissance and the complex cultural legacies that have shaped contemporary Europe. The HEC community is also committed to exploring the place of Europe in the world through the study of empires, global processes and institutions. The variety of research approaches and themes, as well as the broad background of its professors, enable the Department to recruit high- quality Ph.D. candidates and to host outstanding research fellows. Department of Law The Department of Law is European and international in character. It is committed to the study of law in a comparative and contextual manner, with a special focus on European and international law. Courses and seminars are interactive, research-oriented and designed to cover the main subject areas of the Department's work. Researchers gain experience in presenting their work, and are encouraged to participate in conferences, workshops and the Department's Working Groups. Within the department, the Academy of European Law (AEL) offers advanced-level summer courses in Human Rights Law and EU Law. It also manages research projects and runs a publications programme. The EUI Law Department also jointly hosts, with Harvard Law School, the Summer School on Law and Logic. This summer school was launched in 2012 and is also sponsored by CIRSFID-University of Bologna (Italy), the University of Groningen (the Netherlands), the European Academy of Legal Theory, and a grant from the Erasmus Lifelong Learning Programme. Department of Political and Social Sciences The research programme of the Department of Political and Social Sciences (SPS) places emphasis on political and social change within Europe at the national, sub-national and transnational level. The research interests of the Department range across the four sub-disciplines of comparative politics, sociology, international relations, and social and political theory. Courses in both quantitative and qualitative methods are available as options in the first and second year, while field work and data collection normally take place in the second and third year. School of Transnational Governance The School of Transnational Governance was launched in 2017. The School is concerned with problems of governance beyond the state, and offers Executive Training seminars, high-level policy dialogues, and, from Autumn 2020, a masters programme in transnational governance. It is supported by the Erasmus+ programme of the European Commission. Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies The Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies was launched by the European University Institute in 1993 building up on the experience of an already existing Policy Unit, created by Joseph Weiler. It is named for Robert Schuman. The first Director of the newly established Centre was (1993-2001), followed by Helen Wallace (2001-2006), Stefano Bartolini (2006-2013) and Brigid Laffan (2013-). The initial set up was rather modest: one director, one assistant and two secretaries, but over the years the Centre has grown into a large research centre pursuing interdisciplinary research into the key political challenges facing Europe and the EU today and bringing together academics and practitioners, in both policy dialogues and executive training. The Centre's mission is to ‚Äúcontribute to research on the major issues facing contemporary European society, including questions associated with the construction of Europe.‚Äù The Centre has several main programmes. Global Governance Programme The Global Governance Programme brings together academics, diplomats, public officers and officials from international organisations to connect the worlds of research and policy-making. It tackles a wide range of issues, including human rights, international trade, development, climate change, internet governance and regional integration. The programme hosts a series of events, including High-Level Policy Seminars, where participants can exchange ideas. Florence School of Regulation The Florence School of Regulation (FSR) is a centre of excellence for independent research, training and policy dialogue. The FSR has been founded in 2004 as a partnership between the EUI's Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, the Council of the European Energy Regulators (CEER) and the Independent Regulators Group (IRG). The school also works closely with the European Commission.Florence School of Regulation The FSR organises policy events dealing with key regulatory issues, provides academic training for practitioners, produces regulation research and promotes networking and the exchange of ideas in the areas of: * Energy and Climate * Communications and Media * Transport * Water Policy and business decision-makers, regulators, regulated companies and academics from different countries are encouraged to share their experiences through the school. European Union Democracy Observatory The European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO), launched in 2006, is an independent and interdisciplinary academic organisation whose goal is to produce an assessment of democratic practices within the EU. EUDO gathers documentation and data, provides basic and applied research reports for EU institutions, and fosters dialogue between policy-makers, academics and EU citizens. Migration Policy Centre The Migration Policy Centre has been founded in January 2012 and conducts advanced policy-oriented research on global migration, asylum and mobility. It serves governance needs at European and global levels, from developing, implementing and monitoring migration- related policies to assessing their impact on the wider economy and society. Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom The Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom (CMPF) was set up to raise awareness of media diversity and freedom issues in Europe. Co-financed by the European Union, it is composed of experts in legal studies, new media policies, media markets and economics, political science and political communications. Through its programme of research, debate, training and dissemination of results, the CMPF works with academics, policy makers, regulators, market stakeholders, journalists and others interested in the debate. Middle East Directions Programme The Middle East Directions Programme (MEDirections) is a research programme that promotes multidisciplinary research on the Middle East and North Africa to address turbulent changes in the region that profoundly impact its peoples and cause repercussions for Europe. Based on fieldwork findings and collaboration with researchers from the region, MEDirections seeks the new paradigms and the new research focus that are needed to analyse the region and its on-going transformations to better guide policy-making.  Historical Archives of EU  The Historical Archives of the European Union (HAEU) preserves and makes accessible the documents produced by the European Union's institutions according to the thirty year rule governing public access to archival material. The HAEU was established following decisions of the European Coal and Steel Community's (ECSC) and the Council in 1983 to open their historical archives to the public. An agreement between the European Commission and the European University Institute in 1984 led to the creation of the HAEU. The Archives are administered by the EUI and are operative in Florence since 1986. Doctoral and master programmes  Doctoral Programme Doctoral Programme The EUI prepares researchers for developing and defending a doctoral thesis in the fields of economics, history and civilization, law, and political and social sciences. Around 150-160 research grants are awarded annually by the EU Member States and other European national authorities to successful candidates. A Ph.D. from the European University Institute is an internationally recognised qualification. While each department structures its own four-year programme, in all researchers are involved in seminars and other events where they are encouraged to participate and present their work. During their Ph.D. students may travel within the EU and further afield to conduct research, while there are also exchange opportunities. Grants and fees There are funding options available to researchers, with the majority of EU member states offering grants which cover living costs and tuition fees. There are additional agreements with non-EU member states, while the Italian and Spanish ministries of foreign affairs provide grants to a number of countries. Academics not covered by grants pay ‚Ç¨12,000 each year in tuition fees and be able to guarantee at least ‚Ç¨1,200 monthly to cover living costs, although fees may be reduced or waived for candidates from developing countries. Masters Programme in Law Masters Programme in Law Since 1984 the European University Institute has offered law students a one-year programme leading to the degree of Master in Comparative, European and International Law (LL.M. degree level). Languages The majority of students and professors are multilingual; all are required to have a good knowledge of English although French and Italian are also regular working languages and the Institute is committed to accommodating other languages where possible. Postdoctoral fellowships The EUI has several post-doctoral fellowships in the social sciences Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellowships The Max Weber Programme is Europe's largest postdoctoral programme in the social sciences and is funded by the European Commission. Max Weber Fellowships are designed for junior post-docs who would like to pursue an academic career, concentrate on their own research and enhance their academic practice in a multidisciplinary environment. Max Weber Fellowships are for one or two years and are open to candidates who have received a doctorate in the social sciences (economics, law, political science, sociology, history and related fields) within the last five years. Jean Monnet Fellowships Through its Jean Monnet Fellowship Programme the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies offers fellowships to mid- and late-career scholars (while previously the Jean Monnet was a post-doctoral fellowship, it is now available only to those who received their PhD at least five years prior). During their stay at the RSCAS, fellows work on a research topic that fits well in the overall research profile of the RSCAS and participate in the academic life of the Centre and of the EUI. Jean Monnet Fellowships have a duration of one or two years and are open to candidates who have received a doctorate more than five years prior. Fernand Braudel Senior Fellowships Fernand Braudel Senior Fellowships provide a framework for established academics with an international reputation to pursue their research at the EUI. Fellowships last for up to ten months in one of the EUI's four Departments which in turn invite fellows to participate in departmental activities (seminars, workshops, colloquia, etc.). Marie Curie Fellowships The EUI (the Departments and the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies) acts as a host institution for Marie Curie Fellowships which are awarded by the European Commission. Canon Foundation Fellowships The Canon Foundation and the EUI jointly award one Canon Foundation Fellowship each year for post-doctoral research at the EUI. The fellowship is open to candidates of Japanese nationality or permanent residents of Japan. Academy of Finland Fellowships The Academy of Finland awards fellowships for post- doctoral research at the EUI.

It was a two-seat, single-engined biplane with a welded steel framework, covered with fabric. 30 were produced for the Finnish Air Force and served from 1935 to 1949. Design and development Arvo Ylinen, who was the chief designer at the State Aircraft Factory (Valtion lentokonetehdas, abbreviated VL) led a project to create a new trainer aircraft for the Finnish Air Force.

Series production began one year later in 1935 - 30 aircraft were built over a period of two years. Operational history Three different versions of the aircraft were made: a maritime, a pilot training and a reconnaissance training version. Examples were attached to all Finnish Air Force squadrons until 1949, with the identification codes TU-149 to TU-179.

Held annually each summer during the years 1921 to 1940, the CMTC camps differed from National Guard and Organized Reserve training in that the program allowed male citizens to obtain basic military training without an obligation to call-up for active duty. The CMTC were authorized by the National Defense Act of 1920 as a compromise that rejected universal military training. The CMTC was preceded by the Plattsburg Movement, a series of summer training camps that in 1915 and 1916 hosted some 40,000 men largely of elite social classes, the later CMTC trained some 400,000 men from 1921 to 1940. Plattsburgh camps The CMTC was a continuation of the \\"Plattsburgh camps\\", a volunteer pre-enlistment training program organized by private citizens before the U.S. entry into World War I. The camps were set up and funded by the Preparedness Movement, a group of influential pro-Allied Americans. They recognized that the standing U.S. Army was far too small to affect the war and would have to expand immensely if the U.S. went to war.Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941 by Lynne Olson, Random House, 2013, The Movement established the camps to train additional potential Army officers during the summers of 1915 and 1916. The largest and best known was near Plattsburgh, New York under the command of Captain Halstead Dorey and had such students as Grenville Clark, Willard Straight, Robert Bacon, Mayor John Purroy Mitchel & Bishop James De Wolf Perry.Colonel Roosevelt, by Edmund Morris, page 433, published 2010 by Random House, * 40,000 men (all college graduates) attended the Plattsburgh camp and other sites. They became physically fit, learned to march and shoot, and ultimately provided the cadre of a wartime officer corps. Enlistees were required to pay their own expenses.Slotkin, Richard. \\"The Lost Battalions: the Great War and the crisis of American nationality\\" Suggestions by labor unions that talented working-class youth be invited to Plattsburgh were ignored. These camps were formalized under the Military Training Camps Association, which in 1917 launched a monthly magazine, National Service. (In 1922, the magazine was acquired by and folded into The American Army and Navy Journal, and Gazette of the Regular, National Guard and Reserve Forces.) CMTC CMTC camps were a month in length and held at about 50 Army posts nationally. At their peak in 1928 and 1929, about 40,000 men received training, but as a whole the camps were a disappointment at their multiplicity of stated goals, but particularly in the commissioning of Organized Reserve officers. The program established that participants could receive a Reserve commission as a second lieutenant by completing four successive summer courses (titled Basic, White, Red, and Blue), but only 5,000 such commissions were awarded over the 20-year history of the CMTC. Apparently, no records exist that document total participation, but it is estimated that 400,000 men had at least one summer of training.Kington, Donald M., Forgotten Summers: The Story of the Citizens' Military Training Camps, 1921‚Äì1940, Two Decades Publishing (1995), Among known participants were Harry S. Truman, Ronald Reagan, Robert Penn Warren, Walter S. McIlhenny, Chuck Yeager, John J. McCloy and William Guarnere. Camp Edwin F.

H. Auden, Louis MacNeice, Cecil Day-Lewis, Stephen Spender, Christopher Isherwood, and sometimes Edward Upward and Rex Warner. They were sometimes called simply the Thirties poets (see \\"References\\"). Overview Although many newspaper articles and a few books appeared about the \\"Auden Group\\", the existence of the group was essentially a journalistic myth, a convenient label for poets and novelists who were approximately the same age, who had been educated at Oxford and Cambridge, who had known each other at different times, and had more or less left-wing views ranging from MacNeice's political scepticism to Upward's committed communism. The \\"group\\" was never together in the same room; the four poets, Auden, Day- Lewis, MacNeice and Spender, were in the same room only once in the 1930s, for a BBC broadcast in 1938 of modern poets (also including Dylan Thomas and others who were not associated with the \\"Auden Group\\"). This event was so insignificant that Day-Lewis evidently forgot it had occurred when he wrote in his autobiography The Buried Day that the four were first together in 1953. The connections between individual writers, as friends and collaborators, were, however, real. Auden and Isherwood produced three plays and a travel book. Auden and MacNeice collaborated on a travel book. As undergraduates, Auden and Day-Lewis wrote a brief introduction to the annual Oxford Poetry. Auden dedicated books to Isherwood and Spender. Day-Lewis mentioned Auden in a poem. But the whole group never operated as such. Macspaunday \\"MacSpaunday\\" was a name invented by Roy Campbell, in his Talking Bronco (1946), to designate a composite figure made up of the four poets: * Louis MacNeice (\\"Mac\\") * Stephen Spender (\\"sp\\") * W. H. Auden (\\"au-n\\") * Cecil Day- Lewis (\\"day\\") Campbell, in common with much literary journalism of the period, imagined that the four were a group of like-minded poets, although they shared little but left-wing views in the broadest sense of the word. Campbell elsewhere implied that the four were homosexual, but MacNeice and Day-Lewis were entirely heterosexual. In later years the term was sometimes used neutrally, as a synonym for the \\"Thirties poets\\" or \\"the New Poetry of the 1930s\\". References * Carter, Ronald (1984), ed.

These plans are mostly geared towards young people who cannot afford large payments now, but can realistically expect to raise their incomes in the future. For instance a medical student who is just about to finish medical school might not have the financial capability to pay for a mortgage loan, but once he graduates, it is more than probable that he will be earning a high income. It is a form of negative amortization loan. Mechanism GPMs are presently only readily available in the United States for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Selling Guide Announcement SEL-2013-06 - Fannie Mae Aug 20, 2013 Over a period of time, typically 5 to 15 years, the monthly FHA mortgage payments increase every year according to a predetermined percentage. For instance, a borrower may have a 30-year graduated payment mortgage with monthly payments that increase by 7% every year for five years. At the end of five years, the increases stop. The borrower would then pay this new increased amount monthly for the rest of the 25-year loan term.\\"What is a Graduated Payment Mortgage? \\" , nextag.com Risk The graduated payment mortgage seems to be an attractive option for first-time home buyers or those who currently do not have the resources to afford high monthly home mortgage payments. Even though the amounts of payments are drawn out and scheduled, it requires borrowers to predict their future earnings potential and how much they are able to pay in the future, which may be difficult. If borrowers overestimate their future earning potential they may not be able to keep up with the increased monthly payments. Even if the graduated payment mortgage lets borrowers save at the present time by paying low monthly amounts, the overall expense of a graduated payment mortgage loan is higher than that of conventional mortgages, especially when negative amortization is involved.

After military service, several were released into civil use. Design The Viima II is a single engined, tandem seater biplane. Viima means Gale in English. Post war, VL was eventually absorbed into Valmet, so the aircraft is often referred to as the Valmet Viima. It has unequal span, staggered single bay wings built around two box spars with plywood ribs. The interplane struts are N-shaped. The wings are fabric covered and carry four ailerons in all; the upper and lower ailerons are externally linked. The fuselage and tail unit are constructed of chrome-molybdenum steel and are fabric covered. The tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, is wire braced to the small triangular fin. Both the fin and the tailplane are adjustable when on ground. The deep, wide chord rudder reaches to the bottom of the fuselage between the divided elevators. The rudder carries a trim tab and the elevators a Flettner flap. The cockpits are close together, the forward one is at mid-chord with a cut-out in the upper wing to enhance visibility. Dual controls are fitted. The undercarriage is of the split axle type, with the faired main legs attached to the fuselage forward of the wings and braced by rearward struts. It uses low pressure tyres and rubber in compression springing. A tailwheel is fitted. The Viima is powered by an uncowled Siemens- Halske Sh 14 radial engine. All Viimas of the Finnish Air Force were fitted with a framed cockpit in 1950s. Operational history 24 Viimas served with the Finnish Air Force until the early 1960s. Most were then sold to civilian use, with 14 appearing on the Finnish aircraft register.

In the 1970s, the PCA arranged a standard employment contract and minimum wage for professional cricketers in first-class cricket in England and Wales. In 1995 it helped create a pension scheme for cricketers, and in 2002 launched the magazine All Out Cricket, as well as the ACE UK Educational Programme History Former Somerset and England fast bowler Fred Rumsey founded the Professional Cricketers‚Äô Association in 1967. Before the creation of the PCA English cricket players had little to no say in the administration of the game in England and Wales. Rumsey's creation of a players union was recognised when the PCA recently appointed him honorary life founder member and a vice-president. John Arlott became the first president in 1968. Wisden noted that his > \\"democratic views and wise counsel earned him much respect in the cricket > world and among the players. His moderation and tact helped in some tight > corners, notably at the time of the Packer Affair, when he strove to keep > the Cricketers' Association neutral.\\" Mike Edwards was appointed the first treasurer in 1968, and was elected chairman in 1970. He subsequently resigned the post following a majority decision by the membership to accept a donation from the Transvaal in apartheid-era South Africa. Harold Goldblatt was a chartered accountant who was asked by Arlott to assist the PCA. It was he who negotiated the minimum wage, the standard contract and insurance cover for all players. He utilized the over-rate fines from 1985 to form the Cricket Association Charity, for the benefit of former County players who had fallen on hard financial times, and the charity has helped over 80 such players to date. He was appointed senior vice president for life in appreciation of the 30 years of service he gave to the association. In an article about the PCA originally published in the March 1979 issue of The Cricketer, Arlott wrote that Goldblatt was \\"invaluable as financial adviser\\".Arlott on Cricket, edited by David Rayvern Allen, Fontana/Collins, 1985 edition, , pp217-220. In 1997, the PCA was instrumental in settling the dispute between the Test and County Cricket Board and Kerry Packer over his World Series Cricket. In 1999, it played a key r√¥le in the formation of the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (FICA). An anti-doping education programme was launched in 2006, followed in 2008 by an addictive behaviour programme, covering subjects such as problem gambling, and in 2009 an awareness campaign about skin cancer. England women players have been admitted to membership of the PCA since 2011. Administration The committee is headed by a chairman, currently (since February 2017) Daryl Mitchell.

Desert mountainmahogany, curl leaf mountain mahogany where it grows in scattered groves among other drought-resistant species such as Pinyon Pines, Junipers and Sagebrush ecosystems. Description Cercocarpus ledifolius is a large, densely branching tree which can reach heights of 11 m (35 ft), although it is not uncommon to find the adult plant as a shrub as short as 1m (3ft). Its leathery, sticky, dark green leaves are up to 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) long and lance-shaped, and the edges may curl under. The flower consists of a small tan tube from which protrudes a long, plumelike style covered in luxuriant tan hairs. The flowers are arranged in inflorescences of up to 3. The fruit is a hairy achene one half to just over one centimeter (0.2-0.4 inches) long. Age Cercocarpus ledifolius is slow-growing, sometimes taking up to a century to reach full height. The oldest specimens are thought to be around 1,350 years old, although the primary specimen that yielded this estimate was cut down This makes it one of the longest lived known flowering plants. Ecology and uses The leaves are eaten by deer year-round. The Gosiute Native Americans used the wood to make their bows. The species has many medicinal uses for various Native American groups, such as the Paiute and Shoshone.

The son of Thomas Adams and Mary Bowness, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Adams on 16 February 1949, the first Cumberland-born man to be so honoured since 1797.\\"Whitehaven - An Illustrated History\\" by Daniel Hay. Published by Michael Moon 1979. . Background Born in 1890 in Arlecdon, Cumberland, he was educated at Arlecdon Council School, but left at an early age to earn family income; first in farm service, and then in the mines, as his father had been killed in a mining accident when John Adams was only four. In 1910 he emigrated to New Zealand, along with men who later occupied cabinet posts in that country. He returned to West Cumberland in 1914, and plunged into local politics. Career In 1919 he led a successful election challenge to the sitting members of Arlecdon and Frizington District Council. This established the first all-Labour council to be elected in England, and he held the office of Chairman of the Arlecdon and Frizington Urban District Council from 1919 to 1923. He also became a County Councillor in 1919 and from 1922 was vice-chairman of the County Health Committee, and later chairman, during which time infant mortality in the area dropped by 60%. In 1921 he became general secretary of the Winding Enginemen's Union, based in Workington, and was a member of Workington Borough Council from 1923 to 1931. Before 1934 he was honoured with the office of County Alderman. The effect of the depression in West Cumberland was so severe that in the 1930s West Cumberland became a \\"Special Area\\". Jack Adams was invited to become secretary to the new \\"Cumberland Development Council\\". He also became general manager of the West Cumberland Industrial Development Co. Ltd, with the intent of building factories to let, of which the first was at Millom, whilst at Whitehaven the West Cumberland Silk Mills was established. Another great success was the re- opening of the Whitehaven coal mines in 1937, with help from the Nuffield Trust. A particular ingredient in his success was his ability to attract cross-party support, and help from those not normally involved in politics; uniting a common realisation of the terrible effects of over 50% unemployment in West Cumberland. He held the office of Deputy Regional Controller of the Board of Trade for Cumberland and Westmorland Sub-region between 1944 and 1948, and on retiring from that post was appointed an OBE. He had also laid the groundwork of attracting the fledgling Nuclear Industry to West Cumberland, and as a consequence the Royal Ordnance Factory Sellafield became the Windscale, and later the Windscale and Calder Works, of the UKAEA (now known as Sellafield Site). This soaked up the post-war labour released from the Sellafield and Drigg ROFs and from the declining mining and heavy industries of West Cumberland. This is perhaps his most enduring legacy. In 1949 Adams was elevated to the peerage as Baron Adams, of Ennerdale in the County of Cumberland. He retired in 1959, and died in 1960. He is buried in Arlecdon churchyard. The Adams Recreation Ground at St Bees was created in his memory. Family Lord Adams married Agnes Jane Birney in 1914. They had one son, Thomas Adams (b. 1923), who died in infancy. As Lord Adams had no surviving male issue the title became extinct upon his death on 23 August 1960.

The Pyry was in use from 1939 to 1962. The aircraft was a mixed construction of wood, steel, fabric, and duraluminium. History The Finnish Air Force ordered a prototype of the aircraft in 1937. It was to be called VL Pyry I and carried the identification number PY-1. The chief designer was Arvo Ylinen, and the other persons of the design team were Martti Vainio, Torsti Verkkola, and Edward Wegelius. The first flight was made on 29 March 1939 by the factory test pilot. The FAF ordered 40 aircraft in May and the aircraft were quickly constructed and were ready in the spring of 1941. These were designated VL Pyry II and their identification numbers ran from PY-2 - PY-41. Operational history The first unit to be equipped with Pyrys was the Air Force School in Kauhava, in 1941. Around 700 pilots were trained in the aircraft and the type accumulated over 56,000 flying hours over a service life of 20 years. PY-1 and PY-27 made last flights of the Pyry in H√§rm√§l√§ on 7 September 1962. There were 28 accidents of VL Pyry. All together 27 pilots died. The first accident was on 15 June 1941 in Hyvink√§√§.

When the container is full, it is transported away and emptied. The system helps facilitate separation and recycling of waste. The process begins with the deposit of trash into intake hatches, called portholes, which may be specialized for waste, recycling, or compost. Portholes are located in public areas and on private property where the owner has opted in. The waste is then pulled through an underground pipeline by air pressure difference created by large industrial fans, in response to porthole sensors that indicate when the trash needs to be emptied and help ensure that only one kind of waste material is travelling through the pipe at a time. The pipelines converge on a central processing facility that uses automated software to direct the waste to the proper container, from there to be trucked to its final location, such as a landfill or composting plant. History The first system was created in Sweden in the 1960s, designed by the Swedish corporation Envac ABEnvac Group (formerly known as Centralsug AB). The first installation was in 1961 at Sollefte√• Hospital. The first vacuum system for household waste, was installed in the new residential district of √ñr-Hallonbergen, Sweden in 1965. Current systems Pneumatic refuse collection in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country, Northern Spain The Envac proprietary system, Envac Pneumatic Waste Collection System, is used in more than 30 countries. Additionally, the Stream Automated Waste Collection System out of Malaysia has installed many systems in Asia. There are close to a thousand systems in operation all over the world - in China, South East Asia, South Korea, the Middle East, the United States, and Europe. Notable examples in Europe were implemented in the Stockholm area in Sweden. and Legan√©s and Barakaldo in Spain. Another well known, yet rarely seen example is the one used in the utilidors in the Magic Kingdom theme park in Orlando, Florida. In the U.S., this type of system is installed in several places but Disney World and Roosevelt Island are the best known. A pneumatic refuse collection system on Roosevelt Island, New York City, is said to be the largest in the United States and the only system in the U.S. serving a residential complex in this case nearly 10,000 people. Major cities in which the system is operating include Copenhagen, Barcelona, London, and Stockholm. Israel In Israel there are currently 5 systems - 2 operational in Yavne and Ra'anana, and 3 planned in Bat Yam, Tel Aviv and Rishon LeZion. In a techo-economic analysis conducted by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, it was found that the cost of intra-urban treating in pneumatic collection in neighborhoods with multiple units and under funding contractors is 25% lower in comparison to conventional methods, and this is without internalizing the external benefits arising from it (value of time and pollution). It was also found that if the data referred to neighborhoods with higher buildings (with the same number of housing units), the cost of a pneumatic system was even cheaper (at least approximately 20%) In 2006, Yavne municipality issued a tender for the establishment of a pneumatic evacuation of household waste for the residential project \\"Green Neighborhood\\" which comprises 4,700 household units in around 200 buildings. In September 2012, the system began operating in residential use. In February 2014, the municipality began replacing the neighborhood's street trash cans with pneumatic cans. Now there are also around 30 waste collection points in public areas - parks, schools and the streets. The system is also planned to be connected to all future neighborhoods and serve 10,660 house units. In May 2012, Ra'anana municipality approved the residential project \\"Neve Zemer\\" which is planned to include around 3,550 housing units in around 235 buildings with a pneumatic evacuation system of household waste. As of 2018, the pneumatic evacuation system already became operational. As of 2015, Bat Yam municipality is currently engaged in planning a tender for construction and operation of pneumatic evacuation system that includes 5,000 residential neighborhood units (approximately 60 high rise buildings) and 2000 hotel rooms. In 2017, the municipality published the tender for the planning, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the pneumatic evacuation system.http://www.batyam4u.co.il/%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A3-%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%AA-%D7%AA%D7%AA-%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%A7/ In 2009, Tel Aviv municipality's head of the city's construction and infrastructure manager, Dr. Benny Maor, claimed that in new neighborhoods that are planned in the northwest of the city, there is an intention to install a pneumatic evacuation system. In 2013, the municipality requested the preparation of a plan for a pneumatic evacuation system as a condition for a building permit in part of a development plan of 11,446 square meters land plots located in Rothschild Boulevard and Ahad Ha'am streets.https://www.tel- aviv.gov.il/Transparency/DocLib3/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9C%20%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%20-%20%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%91%20%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99%20-%2013-0014%D7%91.pdf Planned systems Europe A system is planned to be installed in the new J√§tk√§saari residential neighbourhood in Helsinki, Finland. All housing cooperatives and other apartment buildings are obliged to join the network. The system envisioned for J√§tk√§saari would help facilitate the separation and recycling of waste. Each building will have a collection point with up to five wastebins or tubes, each for different types of waste and with the capacity to store several parcels of waste. The underground tube network would act in a manner similar to a packet switched telecommunication network, transporting one kind of waste at a time. Once an input bin is filled, or capacity is available, it is transferred to the central collection site combined with the same class of waste. Similarly in Finland, a new suburban development, being built in the city of Tampere, will be home to 13,000 inhabitants, creating approximately 5,000 jobs along the way. The suburb of Vuores will have a total of 124 collection points and 368 waste inlets. The system's daily collection capacity for dry waste, bio waste, paper and recyclable cardboard comes to a combined total of 13 tonnes. The MetroTaifun Automatic Waste Collection System was selected for Vuores since it consumes only a third of the energy compared to conventional pneumatic waste collection solutions, and half of the traditional garbage truck and container based collection method. When ready, the system will consist of about 400 waste inlets and 13 km of pipe work. The MetroTaifun automatic waste collection system started to collect waste in 2012. In Bergen, Norway, a system covers most of the city center. North America A system is planned for a new City Center development in Carmel, Indiana. It would service condominiums, businesses, and a hotel. In March 2015, the city of Montreal abandoned its $3 million investment in a plan to install an automated vacuum collection system in the Quartier des Spectacles entertainment district. Another installation is planned for Hudson Yards, Manhattan. Middle East The world's largest AWCS is now being built in the vicinity of Islam's holiest mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. During the Ramadan and Hajj, 600 tonnes (or 4,500 cubic meters) of waste is generated each day, which puts a heavy demand on those responsible for collecting the waste and litter. In the MetroTaifun Automatic Waste Collection System, the waste is automatically collected from 74 waste feeding points spread out across the area and then transferred via a 20-kilometre pipe network to a central collection point, keeping all the waste collecting activities out of sight and below ground with the central collection point well away from the public areas.

A Landser (randoseru) Tornister in full array, WW I German Infantry kit. A is a firm-sided backpack made of stitched firm leather or leather-like synthetic material, most commonly used in Japan by elementary schoolchildren. Traditionally it is given to a child upon beginning his or her first year of school, whereupon the child uses the same bag until grade 6. Etymology Some people have hypothesized that term is borrowed from the Dutch \\"ransel\\" or German \\"Ranzen\\" meaning \\"backpack\\", a clue to its origins nearly 200 years ago as used in the Netherlands. The weakness of the above hypothesis is that \\"ransel,\\" written in Japanese romaji would be ranseru, which does not account for the \\"do\\" portion of randoseru. Ranzen is even more dissimilar to randoseru. As such, this theory seems to be struggling to make a connection where none exists. The more likely possibility is that the word \\"Randoseru\\" comes from the German word Landser which means a soldier (cf. ). The German backpack worn by the Landser is traditionally referred to as a Tornister (cf. ), whose shape is very distinct yet similar to the Japanese randoseru bag. This theory makes more sense, as the German word Landser would be written and read as Randoseru in Japanese romaji orthography. Also, the German Army provided the second wave of military advisers to the Meiji government, resulting in the Japanese Imperial Army adopting much of its practice, so it is highly likely that the infantry backpacks were also adopted at the time along with the Prussian blue uniform adopted by Gakushuin and the Imperial Japanese Army Academy at Sobudai. With the German Landser (randoseru) pack being adopted at the elite schools, the bags filtered down throughout Japan, eventually taking its current form and name.  Design  In more conservative schools the color, brand and design is mandated, typically with red as the traditional color for girls and black for boys. More colorful versions such as pink, brown, dark blue, green, blue and even two-tones are also available. These varieties have existed since the 1960s but sold poorly due to the lock- step mentality of the education system that gradually began changing in the early 2000s. The increased variety of colors is partly as a compromise for parents to retain some tradition within modernized schools which no longer require the use of traditional uniforms or the randoseru. A typical randoseru measures roughly 30 cm high by 23 cm wide by 18 cm deep, and features a softer grade of leather or other material on those surfaces which touch the body. When empty, it weighs approximately 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds). However, due to demand for a lighter, more robust randoseru, as of 2004 approximately 70% are made from the synthetic leather Clarino. The backpacks are designed to have hard leather sides and divided compartments inside. They close with a long flap that goes over the entire length of the bag and clip at the bottom. Manufacturers usually offer \\"randoseru\\" in two sizes, with a slightly larger one sized to hold modern A4 flat files. To increase traffic safety for children commuting to and from school, many communities have begun working with to distribute yellow plastic covers that drape over the back of the randoseru to increase its visibility.  History  The use of the randoseru began in the Edo era. Along with a wave of western reforms in the Japanese military, the Netherlands-style rucksack called was introduced as a new way for the foot soldiers to carry their baggage. The shape much resembled the randoseru bags used today. In 1885, the Japanese government, through the elementary school Gakush≈´in, proposed the use of a backpack as the new ideal for Japanese elementary school students. At Gakush≈´in, the practice of coming to school by cars and rickshaws were banned, promoting the idea that the students should carry their own equipment and come to school by their own feet. At this time, the bag looked more like normal rucksack. This changed, however, in 1887. The crown prince of the time was given a backpack upon entering elementary school (at Gakush≈´in). To honor the soldiers of the country, the shape of the backpack resembled the backpacks used in the military. The word, \\"Randoseru\\" comes from the German word Landser which means a soldier (cf. ). As Japanese Military had recently adopted the German Prussian blue uniform following the victory of Prussia (Germany) in the Franco-Prussian War, it also adopted the German military backpack. The German backpack worn by the Landser is traditionally referred to as a Tornister (cf. ), whose shape is very distinct yet similar to the Japanese randoseru bag. This quite immediately became the fashion, and the shape has continued to become the randoseru used today. However, at that time most of the Japanese people could not afford such an expensive bag. Until the dramatic rise of economy in Japan in the post-World War II period, the main school bags in Japan were simple shoulder bags and furoshiki (square folding cloths). It is a popular saying that the metal clip on the side of the randoseru was used in the military to carry grenades. However, this is not true. The metal clip was introduced in the post-World War II period, as a means to carry lunch boxes, change of clothes for P.E., etc. Around March 2014, American actress Zooey Deschanel took her picture with red randoseru on her back, and it is becoming the boom for young people to wear randoseru. In recent years, in addition to the boom spread by the above-mentioned American actress, there are an increasing number of people outside Japan who know about randoseru through Japanese animation, manga, etc. and purchase them as souvenirs when traveling to Japan. They are sometimes sold in stores for tourists and in airports in Japan.  Production  Most randoseru production is carried out by hand. A randoseru is constructed of a single-piece body and around 200 fittings, a combination of die-cut materials and urethane backing plates. Assembly involves crimping, machine-sewing, walnut-gluing, drilling each shoulder strap, and riveting. The bag's materials and workmanship are designed to allow the backpack to endure the child's entire elementary education (six years). However, the care usually given to the randoseru throughout that time and afterwards can extend its life and preserve it in near-immaculate condition long after the child has reached adulthood, a testament to its utility and the sentiment attached to it by many Japanese as symbolic of their relatively carefree childhood years. The randoseru's durability and significance is reflected in its cost. A new randoseru made of genuine or synthetic leather can carry a price tag of around 30,000-40,000 yen at a chain store/supermarket. Typically randoseru from department stores or traditional workshops will be priced in the region of 55,000-70,000 yen, with some models (particularly those branded with logos) reaching over 100,000 yen. Clarino, a synthetic material frequently used as a substitute, reduces the cost somewhat. Often randoseru are available on auction sites in new or used condition at much lower prices, particularly after the start of the Japanese school year in April. As of January 2012, the five top randoseru in order of popularity at Amazon.co.jp are in the range of 8,280‚Äì16,980 yen (76‚Äì156 US dollars).

It is one of the most complete aspects of Indian classical music, demonstrating the entire gamut of talents and the depth of knowledge of the musician. It incorporates raga alapana, tanam, niraval, and kalpanaswara. In more elaborate ragam tanam pallavis, a tani avartanamKassebaum (2000), 158 may follow. Ragam \\"Ragam\\" in the context of \\"Ragam Tanam Pallavi\\" refers to raga alapana - the first component. In this form of pure melodic improvisation, the musician starts with a refrain to create the mood of raga and lays a foundation for composition to follow. Each Ragam tanam pallavi has at least one raga associated with it. TanamTanam singing - A dying art Tanam is one of the most important forms of improvisation, and is integral to RTP. It is the second component of this composite form of improvisation. Originally developed for the veena, it consists of expanding the raga with syllables from the phrase \\"Ananta Anandam Ta\\" ( Means \\"Oh Lord, Give me happiness\\"). Tanam is a rhythmic version of the raga alapana. Some artists sing a ragamalika tanam too. Although tanam is often rendered without percussion support, the element of rhythm is more obvious in this type of improvisation. It is rendered in medium speed and just before commencing the third component of this composite form of improvisation; the pallavi. Pallavi The word Pallavi is derived from the three syllables Pa - Pada (words), La - Laya (rhythm) and Vi - Vinyasam (variations). Pallavi is the equivalent of a refrain in Western music. The Pallavi is usually a one-line composition set to a single or more cycle(s) of a tala. The tala could range from the simple to the complex and there may also be different gatis being employed. Pallavi has 2 portions to it. The first half of Pallavi is an ascending piece of notes (Purvangam) and the first half of the Pallavi mostly ends at the stroke of the beginning of the second half of the Thalam cycle or in the beginning of the shortest part of the Thalam, called the Arudhi. Arudhi is the point of division of the two parts of a Pallavi. Between the first half of the Pallavi and the second half of the Pallavi there will be a brief pause called as the Vishranthi or resting time which is an extension of the last syllable of the Purvangam and then the second portion of the Pallavi (Uttarangam) starts. Executing niraval for a pallavi is unique, as, unlike in a kriti, the artist is not allowed to change the locations of each syllable in the sahityam, as this lessens the innate beauty of the pallavi. The basic style in Pallavi rendition is to sing the Pallavi in different speeds and Nadai. In most cases the Pallavi is set to Chatushtra Nadai meaning each beat carries 4 matras (units). So the singer will then sing the Pallavi in 3 different speeds, once with each Beat carrying 2 units (Vilomam), then 4 units and then 8 units per beat (Anulomam). They can also alter the speed of the Tala (Pratilomam) and keep the speed of the Sahityam constant. Once this is completed then they would sing the Pallavi in different Nadais (Mostly Tisra Nadai meaning each beat now carries 3 units) i.e. keeping the words and the length of the pallavi constant but changing the nadai of the thalam. All this can be done from the start of the pallavi or from the Arudhi. Some singers do this presentation before Swaraprastharam (Most common practice). Others alter the speed and Nadai during singing Swaras and then sing the Pallavi such that the position of Arudhi remains constant. Once these aspects are covered, the singer explores in the Kalpanaswara phase and they would start exploring different Ragas during the Kalpanaswara. The Pallavi challenges the musician's ability to improvise with complex and intricate patterns. The whole exercise is very demanding, both technically and musically, since all the artiste's musicianship is put to test.  Contemporary Ragam Tanam Pallavi  Today, most concerts by prominent carnatic vocalists include a Ragam Tanam Pallavi (RTP). RTPs can be performed in any raga. Both popular as well as rare ragas can be used to perform a RTP. RTPs in rare ragas are common because the vocalist can present the pallavi with self- composed lyrics and hence need not search for or compose a kriti in the rare raga. In other words, artists often use the RTP portion of the concert to introduce their audience to ragams that are rarely sung. Many artists announce the name of the ragam before the pallavi portion.  Innovations   Introducing the name of the Ragam in the Pallavi sahityam  In the recent time pallavis, the artist includes the name of the ragam in the words used in the Pallavi. This helps the less-knowledgeable audience to identify the ragam (if the name of the ragam is not already announced) and also appeals to the audience as well as critics. * 'Vandadum Solaiyile Malayamarutham Veesuthe' (set to Raga Malayamarutham) presented by Sanjay Subrahmanyan * Sruthi laya bhaava sangeetham adhai en vasam thaa', bhairavi paavani' (set to Ragas Vasantha, Bhairavi and Vasanthabhairavi) presented by T.N.Seshagopalan * 'Brindavana Sarangan Bhoolokavaikunthan Srirangan' (set to Raga Brindavana Saranga) presented by T.N.Seshagopalan.  Presentation of Pallavis using a Talam in two or more nadais within a cycle  Most pallavis are presented in a talam in a single nadai. But dwi-nadai (2 nadais), tri-nadai (3 nadais)and pancha-nadai (5 nadais) pallavis are also presented by experienced and seasoned artists. The use of such Talams is under debate and the views of artists vary. * 'Dhananjaya Sarathey Dayanidhe Kripanidhe Rakshamam' (set to Raga Bahudari) presented by Ranjani Gayatri - Khanda jathi Triputa talam with Laghu in Tisra Nadai and Dhrutams in Chatusra Nadai * 'Raajamatangi Lathangi Maampahi Matangi' (set to Raga Lathangi) presented by M.L.Vasanthakumari - Chatusra jathi Jhampa talam with Laghu in Tisra Nadai and Anudrutham and Dhrutam in Khanda Nadai. * Raga Kalyani Pallavi presented by Pantula Rama - Khanda jathi Ata talam with first Laghu in Chatusra Nadai, second Laghu in Tisra Nadai and Dhrutams in Khanda Nadai. * A Pancha Nadai Pallavi presented by Sudha Raghunathan - Khanda jathi Eka Talam with first akshara in Tisra nadai, second in Chatusra nadai, third in Khanda nadai, fourth in Misra nadai and fifth in Sankeerna nadai  Pallavis in many Ragams  It has been time noticed from time immemorial, that multiple ragam pallavis are being used in the concert circle. In this, the artist keeps on shifting between all the ragas in the whole presentation. They be dwi-2, tri-3 or chatur-4 raga pallavis. Some pallavis have been cited as examples for all these forms. = Dwi-raga pallavis: = The above three examples are all presented by Ranjani Gayatri. * 'Sharavanabhava Guhane Shanmugane Ennai Ka Nataraja Mainda' (set to Ragas Kannada (Purvangam)and Kaanada (Uttarangam)) * 'Mohana Kannanai Pani Maname Ranjakamai Kuzhaloodum' (set to Ragas Mohanam (Poorvangam) and Ranjani (Uttarangam)) * 'Arabhimanam vaittu adarippar ennai Anandabhairavi' (set to Ragas Arabhi (Poorvangam) and Anandabhairavi (Uttarangam)) Other examples of Dwi-raga pallavis are Amrithavarshini/ Anandabhairavi by M.Balamuralikrishna, Saranga/ Nayaki by Ranjani Gayatri, Bhairavi/Sindhu Bhairavi by T.N.Seshagopalan and Mohanam/Kalyanavasantham by Bombay Jayashri. = Tri- raga pallavis: = Some Tri-raga pallavis are: * 'Saraswathi Veena Pustaka Dharini Hari Vakshasthalaye Lalithe Maate Kanakadurge' in Ragas Saraswati, Lalitha and Durga by Ranjani Gayatri * 'Chiranda engal Nattai kurinji enbar' in Ragas Nattai, Kurinji and Nattaikurinji by T.N.Seshagopalan = Chatur- raga pallavis: = Some Chatur-raga pallavis are: * 'Shankarabharananai Azhaithodi vaadi Kalyani Darbarukku'in Ragas Dheerashankarabharanam, Hanumatodi, Mechakalyani and Darbar - written by Kunrakudi Krishnaiyyar, popularized by Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar.

Talamalika in RTPs  Sometimes, artists change the tala of the RTP from the main tala to another which has same number of aksharas or a tala which has some number of aksharas, which when sung some integral number of times equals the number of aksharas in the main tala. * Consider a pallavi set to Khanda jathi Thriputa talam Chatusra nadai. It has 36 aksharas. This Pallavi can be sung using Chatusra jathi Ata Talam Tisra nadai which has the same number of Aksharas - 36. This is an example of changing to a tala which has the same number of aksharas * Consider the same pallavi set to Khanda jathi Thriputa talam Chatusra nadai. This pallavi can also be sung in Tisra jathi Jhampa talam Tisra nadai which has 18 aksharas in a cycle. Hence the complete pallavi can be sung within two cycles of the talam i.e. 36 aksharas. This is an example of changing to a tala which when sung integral number of times gives the same number of aksharas as in the main tala. Talamalika singing examples can be seen from the above citation (This is from a concert of Ranjani Gayatri).  Ragamala RTPs  This is a type of RTP where a Raga which has many Ragas with a similar name are sung in an RTP. Ragas with similar names like Group of Ranjani ragas, Bhairavi ragas or Varali ragas can be used for presentation. A good example is a recent rendition by Ranjani-Gayathri where they used the Pallavi phrase \\"Ranjani Kanchadala Lochani Brovavamma Thalli Niranjani\\"‚Äîtheir RTP was set to the ragam Ranjani. About 30 minutes into the RTP, when they started switching ragams, they switched to Sriranjani, Janaranjani, Sivaranjani, Manoranjani and Sumanesha Ranjani. Since the audience are likely to be unfamiliar with some of these ragams, they changed their Pallavi phrase at the end of each of these 4-5 minute renderings- for instance, they finished Janaranjini rendition with \\"Ranjani Kanchadala Lochani Brovavamma Thalli Janaranjani\\". A musically literate audience often appreciate this approach, since this gives them 4‚Äì5 minutes to guess the ragam before the artist gives them the answer. Finishing a Ragam Tanam Pallavi As stated in the previous section a contemporary RTP is rarely ever restricted to just one ragam. The artist sings ragamalika swarams and tanams. Experienced artists sing all the extra ragas other than the main raga in a reverse order before coming back to the main raga and then complete the RTP. Others too come back to the main raga to finish the RTP section. It is very now-a-days to find an RTP without ragamalika. While the artist might spend 35‚Äì40 minutes on the main ragam , he or she will only devote about 4‚Äì5 minutes to each subsequent ragam. RTP requires not only experience but formidable amount of planning. First and foremost is the sequence of the ragams‚Äîwhile the audience may not expect a logical order, the critics surely will. Secondly, since this part of the concert is likely to last anywhere between 40 and 60 minutes, the performer must pick their ragams very carefully. Last but not least, the accompanying violinist should be able to render each of these ragams as well. Lot of mathematics is also involved in the presentation of an RTP. Therefore, only an artist with a good amount of knowledge in theory of carnatic music as well as practical experience can present a Ragam Tanam Pallavi with ease.

Biography Noddings received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physical science from Montclair State College in New Jersey, a master's degree in mathematics from Rutgers University, and a Ph.D. in education from the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Nel Noddings worked in many areas of the education system. She spent seventeen years as an elementary and high school mathematics teacher and school administrator, before earning her PhD and beginning work as an academic in the fields of philosophy of education, theory of education and ethics, specifically moral education and ethics of care. She became a member of the Stanford faculty in 1977, and was the Jacks Professor of Child Education from 1992 until 1998. While at Stanford University she received awards for teaching excellence in 1981, 1982 and 1997, and was the associate dean or acting dean of the School of Education for four years. After leaving Stanford University, she held positions at Columbia University and Colgate University. She is past president of the Philosophy of Education Society and the John Dewey Society. In 2002-2003 she held the John W. Porter Chair in Urban Education at Eastern Michigan University. She has been Lee L. Jacks Professor of Education, Emerita, at Stanford University since she retired in 1998. Nel Noddings has 10 children, 39 grandchildren, and over 20 great- grandchildren, many of whom are highly educated and educators themselves. In 2012 she lost her husband of over 60 years to cancer. Noddings' fruitful career was matched by an equally fruitful domestic life. According to infed.org, Noddings describes herself as \\"‚Äòincurably domestic‚Äô not only because she and her husband raised ten children, but because she also appreciates \\"order in the kitchen, a fresh tablecloth, flowers on the table and food waiting for guests‚Äô. She added, ‚ÄòI like having pets and kids around‚Äô. Feminists, she commented, sometimes find it hard to admit such things matter to them.\\" She has described her early educational experiences and her close relationships as key in her development of her philosophical position. Early relationships with caring teachers inspired her passion for her later work.  Personality  Colleague Michael Katz describes Noddings as \\"one of the most efficient people\\" he knows, a \\"consummate teacher-scholar,\\" who lives according to the \\"do it now\\" philosophy and \\"never lets her status as a famous scholar and lecturer and author interfere with treating everyone with the same kindness, thoughtfulness, and consideration that she would expect people to show her, regardless of her status or position.\\" Work Contributions to philosophy Noddings' first sole-authored book Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education (1984) followed close on the 1982 publication of Carol Gilligan‚Äôs ground-breaking work in the ethics of care In a Different Voice. While her work on ethics continued, with the publication of Women and Evil (1989), and later works on moral education, most of her later publications have been on the philosophy of education and educational theory. Her most significant works in these areas have been Educating for Intelligent Belief or Unbelief (1993) and Philosophy of Education (1995). Besides contributing to philosophy, Noddings also works in the field of social psychology. Noddings is currently on the Editorial Board of Greater Good Magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center of the University of California, Berkeley. Noddings' contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships. Nel Noddings' relational ethics Nel Noddings' approach to ethics of care has been described as relational ethics because it prioritizes concern for relationships. Like Carol Gilligan, Noddings accepts that justice based approaches, which are supposed to be more masculine, are genuine alternatives to ethics of care. However, unlike Gilligan, Noddings' believes that caring, 'rooted in receptivity, relatedness, and responsiveness' is a more basic and preferable approach to ethics (Caring 1984, 2). =Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education= The key to understanding Noddings' ethics of care is to understand her notion of caring and ethical caring in particular. Noddings believes that it would be a mistake to try to provide a systematic examination of the requirements for caring; nevertheless, she does suggest three requirements for caring (Caring 1984, 11-12). She argues that the carer (one-caring) must exhibit engrossment and motivational displacement, and the person who is cared for (cared-for) must respond in some way to the caring (1984, 69). Noddings' term engrossment refers to thinking about someone in order to gain a greater understanding of him or her. Engrossment is necessary for caring because an individual's personal and physical situation must be understood before the one-caring can determine the appropriateness of any action. 'Engrossment' need not entail, as the term seems to suggest, a deep fixation on the other. It requires only the attention needed to come to understand the position of the other. Engrossment could not on its own constitute caring; someone could have a deep understanding of another person, yet act against that person's interests. Motivational displacement prevents this from occurring. Motivational displacement occurs when the one-caring's behaviour is largely determined by the needs of the person for whom she is caring. On its own, motivational displacement would also be insufficient for ethical caring. For example, someone who acted primarily from a desire to accomplish something for another person, but failed to think carefully enough about that other person's needs (failed to be correctly engrossed in the other), would fail to care. Finally, Noddings believes that caring requires some form of recognition from the cared-for that the one-caring is, in fact, caring. When there is a recognition of and response to the caring by the person cared for, Noddings describes the caring as \\"completed in the other\\" (1984, 4). Nel Noddings draws an important distinction between natural caring and ethical caring (1984, 81-83). Noddings distinguishes between acting because \\"I want\\" and acting because \\"I must\\". When I care for someone because \\"I want\\" to care, say I hug a friend who needs hugging in an act of love, Noddings claims that I am engaged in natural caring. When I care for someone because \\"I must\\" care, say I hug an acquaintance who needs hugging in spite of my desire to escape that person's pain, according to Noddings, I am engaged in ethical caring. Ethical caring occurs when a person acts caringly out of a belief that caring is the appropriate way of relating to people. When someone acts in a caring way because that person naturally cares for another, the caring is not ethical caring (1984, 79-80). Noddings' claims that ethical caring is based on, and so dependent on, natural caring (1984, 83, 206 fn 4). It is through experiencing others caring for them and naturally caring for others that people build what is called an \\"ethical ideal\\", an image of the kind of person they want to be. Noddings describes wrong actions in terms of \\"a diminishment of the ethical ideal\\" and \\"evil\\". A person's ethical ideal is diminished when she either chooses or is forced to act in a way that rejects her internal call to care. In effect, her image of the best person it is possible for her to be is altered in a way that lowers her ideal. According to Noddings, people and organizations can deliberately or carelessly contribute to the diminishment of other's ethical ideals. They may do this by teaching people not to care, or by placing them in conditions that prevent them from being able to care (1984, 116-119). A person is evil if, in spite of her ability to do otherwise, she either fails to personally care for someone, or prevents others from caring. Noddings writes, \\"[when] one intentionally rejects the impulse to care and deliberately turns her back on the ethical, she is evil, and this evil cannot be redeemed\\" (1984, 115). This is referred to as \\"obligation\\". \\"There are moments for all of us when we care quite naturally. We just do care; no ethical effort is required. 'Want' and 'ought' are indistinguishable in such cases.\\" I have the ability to \\"abstain from action if I [so] believe that anything I might do would tend to work against the best interests of the cared-for.\\" According to Noddings we are obligated to pursue the \\"musts\\". Criticisms of Noddings' relational ethics Nel Noddings' ethics of care has been criticised by both feminists and those who favour more traditional, and allegedly masculine, approaches to ethics. In brief, feminists object that the one caring is, in effect, carrying out the traditional female role in life of giving while receiving little in return. Those who accept more traditional approaches to ethics argue that the partiality shown to those closest to us in Noddings' theory is inappropriate. Noddings tends to use unequal relationships as a model for understanding caring. Philosopher and feminist Sarah Lucia Hoagland argues that the relationships in question, such as parenting and teaching, are ideally relationships where caring is a transitory thing designed to foster the independence of the cared-for, and so end the unequal caring relationship. Unequal relationships, she writes, are ethically problematic, and so a poor model for an ethical theory. Hoagland argues that on Noddings' account of ethical caring, the one-caring is placed in the role of the giver and the cared-for in the role of the taker. The one-caring is dominant, choosing what is good for the cared-for, but gives without receiving caring in return. The cared-for is put in the position of being a dependent, with insufficient control over the nature of the caring. Hoagland believes that such unequal relationships cannot be morally good. Contributions to education Ethic of care in education In education, the ethic of care speaks of obligation to do something right and a sense that we must do something right when others address us.Noddings et al. (2003) The \\"I must\\" response is induced in direct encounter in preparation for response. We respond because we want to; either we love and respect those that address us or we have significant regard for them. As a result, the recipients of care must respond in a way that demonstrates their caring has been received. In regards, to education, caring refers to the relationship between student and teacher, not just the person who cares.Noddings et al. (1999) As educators respond to the needs of students, teachers may see the need to design a differentiated curriculum because as teachers work closely with students, we will be moved by their different needs and interests.Noddings et al.(1999) The claim to care must not be based on a one time virtuous decision but an ongoing interest in the student‚Äôs welfare. Needs in the ethic of care model Distinction In ‚ÄúIdentifying Needs in Education\\" Noddings (2003) provides criteria for deciding whether a want should be recognized or treated as a need.Noddings (2003) This criteria is as follows: * The want is fairly stable over a considerable period of time and/or it is intense. *The want is demonstrably connected to some desirable end or, at least, to one that is not harmful; further, the end is impossible or difficult to reach without the object wanted. * The want is in the power (within the means) of those addressed to grant it. *The person wanting is willing and able to contribute to the satisfaction of the want. Inferred needs The overt or explicit curriculum in education is designed to meet the inferred needs of students, as they are those identified by teachers or individuals to improve the classroom learning environment. In the ethics of care philosophy, inferred needs are referred to as those that come from those not directly expressing the need. Most needs identified by educators for learners are inferred needs because they are not being identified by the learners themselves.Noddings (2005) Students‚Äô inferred needs can often be identified interactively, through working with them one on one or observing their behaviour in a classroom environment.Noddings, (2005) Expressed needs  Expressed needs are difficult to assess and address in the classroom environment, as they are needs directly expressed by learners through behaviour or words. Although expressed needs are difficult to address, educators need to treat them positively in order to maintain a caring relationship with learners. If expressed needs are not treated carefully, the individual might not feel cared for.Noddings, 2005 Educators should make a consistent effort to respond to a student‚Äôs expressed needs through prior planning and discussions of moral and social issues surrounding the needs Noddings, 1996 Basic (universal) needs Basic needs are defined as the most basic needs required to survive such as food, water and shelter. Basic needs and needs associated with self- actualization (overwhelming needs) co-exist when basic needs are being compromised over extended periods of time. Overwhelming needs Overwhelming needs cannot be met by the usual processes of schooling and include extreme instances such as abuse, neglect and illness. As well, a student‚Äôs socioeconomic status (SES) or dysfunctional family environment can cause them to come to school with needs that cannot be expressed nor met by educators. To help meet those overwhelming needs of students, particularly those in poor neighborhood, the ethic of care philosophy dictates that schools should be full-service institutions. Medical and dental care, social services, childcare and parenting advice should be available on campus. In turn, students in these situations are often forced into academic courses and fight an uphill battle, where they have to engage in activities that are difficult to focus on, based on their circumstances. Implications for education People who are poor, perhaps homeless, without dependable transportation cannot afford to run all over town seeking such services, and often they don‚Äôt know where to begin. Despite being aware of the overwhelming needs many students face, we force all children‚Äîregardless of interest or aptitude‚Äîinto academic courses and then fight an uphill battle to motivate them to do things they do not want to do. Emotion and professionalism in teacher education Emotion has been aggravated by the rise of professions with their insistence on detachment, distance, cool appraisal and systematic procedures. Concern for rational and professional functioning keeps emotion out of education, as it is supposed that real professionals do not allow themselves to feel controlled by their emotions and are forced to face problems with dispassionate rationality Noddings (1996) states that in the teaching profession, the concern takes several forms: *Fear that professional judgment will be impaired by emotions *Professionals must learn to protect themselves against the burnout that may result from feeling too much for one‚Äôs students *It has become a mark of professionalism to be detached, cool and dispassionate The use of stories in teacher education could be powerful in dispelling these beliefs, as they illustrate how deeply experienced teachers feel about the inevitable difficulties that occur in the classroom Educating the whole child In the ethic of care model, the aim of education is centered around happiness. Incorporating this component into education involves not only helping our students understand the components of happiness by allowing teachers and students to interact as a whole community In regard to the education of the whole child, Noddings (2005) stated that, ‚ÄúWe will not find the solution to problems of violence, alienation, ignorance, and unhappiness in increasing our security, imposing more tests, punishing schools for their failure to produce 100 percent proficiency, or demanding that teachers be knowledgeable in the subjects they teach. Instead, we must allow teachers and students to interact as whole persons, and we must develop policies that treat the school as a whole community.‚Äù Criticisms of the ethic of Care in education One criticism of Noddings' ethic of care, in regards to education, is that it advocates little importance to caring for oneself, except as a means to provide further care for others.Engster, 2004 In regards to education, the teacher-student relationship could be jeopardized because the educator might not engage in self care and instead, devote all their energy into meeting their students' needs. Hoaglard (1991, p. 255) states that the caregiver would be defined as a ‚Äúmartyr, servant or slave‚Äù by the philosophy in the ethic of care. Another criticism of Noddings' argument is that ethic of care may result not only in the exploitation of the caregiver, but also in a smothering paternalism. Goodin (1996, p. 507) writes that, ‚Äúthe trouble with subsuming individuals into relationships of ‚Äòwe‚Äôness is precisely that we then risk losing track of the separateness of people‚Äù. As well, Goodin (1996, p. 116-120) states that Noddings' criteria for implicit and explicit needs assumes that needs are transparent to the caregiver and that the caregiver‚Äôs perceptions are privileged in the process of interpreting needs. Lastly, Grimshaw (1986) explains that it is important to consider that good care always entails an element of distance between individuals.Grimshaw, 1986 She states, (1986, p. 183) ‚ÄúCare and understanding require the sort of distance that is needed in order not to see the other as a projection of the self, or self as a continuation of other‚Äù. Thus, a clear distance between the self and the individual that is being cared for needs to exist in order to keep the personal care of both individuals in mind.

The screenplay was adapted by Emil Stern from the Laura Kasischke novel of the same name. The film stars Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood. It was released on April 18, 2008, and revolves around a survivor's guilt from a Columbine-like event that occurred 15 years previously, which causes her present-day idyllic life to fall apart. Plot Imaginative, impetuous, and wild Diana McFee (Evan Rachel Wood) cannot wait for her adult life to begin. While awaiting the final days of high school in the lush springtime, Diana tests her limits with sex and drugs as her more conservative friend Maureen (Eva Amurri) watches with concern. Then the two teens are involved in a Columbine-like shooting incident at their school and are forced to make an impossible choice. The film mostly focuses on Diana's adulthood (Uma Thurman). She leads an apparently normal life as an art history university professor. She has a daughter, Emma (Gabrielle Brennan), and she's married to the professor who once gave a speech in her school about the power of visualization, how one can shape one's own future in this way. However, Diana continues to feel guilty about something that doesn't let her sleep. One day she gets a call from Emma's school, where the nuns running the school complain about Emma's behavior. At an ice cream parlor, Diana asks Emma not to hide any more as she is always doing; Emma responds to her mother's reproaches with the claim that Diana hates her. They leave the parlor abruptly and as they're about to get into the car, Diana sees her husband with another woman. She hesitates about confronting him and instead remains in the middle of the street where she is hit by a pickup truck. On her way to the hospital she imagines that blood is escaping from her body. In reality, she hasn't been hurt by the accident. Instead, Diana is remembering the complications she had following an abortion in her high school days. The day of the 15th anniversary of the shooting, a memorial is held at the school. Diana drives in front of the school several times until she finally decides to stop and bring in some flowers. As she enters the school she's asked whether she's one of the survivors. She smiles and walks inside, first leaving flowers on some desks and then moving on to the rest rooms where one of the shootings took place. At that moment she gets a call from Emma's school informing her that her daughter is missing and that a pink piece of clothing has been found in the woods. She drives there and walks through the woods, shouting out her daughter's name. Emma appears before Diana's eyes for a moment but then vanishes almost as soon as she has appeared. It is revealed what occurred fifteen years earlier in the washroom where Diana left the flowers. She and Maureen had been forced to decide who would survive when confronted by the shooter, Michael Patrick (John Magaro). Though Maureen had offered herself first, the shooter questioned why Diana should not die. In response, Diana agreed to be killed and was shot by Michael, who then killed himself. At that moment, Diana dreamed the adult life she thought she would have if she let Maureen die and Emma was the child she would have had if she had not gone through the abortion. At the anniversary, Diana is asked once again if she is a survivor. She replies \\"No\\" with a smile, with a sense of relief that she did the right thing by dying and having her friend live her life.

The film uses the metaphor of Pittsburgh being the real-life Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and, during the making of the film, Kurlander and his crew got crowds from Times Square to Beverly Hills to sing Fred Rogers' theme song \\"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\\" The film, which was picked up by Panorama Entertainment, has played over 26 cities across North America including special screenings for the International MENSA society, the keynote for the International Downtown Association Annual Conference, and on Capitol Hill at the U.S. Capitol Visitor's Center where Congressman Mike Doyle called the film \\"a comeback story which can inspire cities around this country.\\" Howard Fineman of Newsweek and The Huffington Post wrote: '\\"Carl Kurlander's movie is the wry, funny tale of the fulfillment he found moving back home to the city of his youth. A cross between Woody Allen and Fred Rogers, he reminds us that our cities are the real \\"Real America\\" because they are the creative, connected places in which we can best renew ourselves, our country, and our hope for all humanity.\\" Kurlander is also the producer of the award-winning documentary The Shot Felt 'Round The World, also known as A Shot That Saved The World, which won Best Documentary at the San Luis Obisbo Film Festival and has been picked up for broadcast by the Smithsonian Channel. The film is about Jonas Salk and his team at the University of Pittsburgh who pulled together with a nation to conquer one of the most feared diseases of the twentieth century, polio, and current efforts to finish the job and make the world polio free. \\"Shot\\" began as a class project at the University of Pittsburgh based on footage culled from the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the Salk vaccine. The updated version of the film features a rare film interview with Bill Gates speaking about the current polio eradication effort. In addition to continuing to teach as a senior lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, Carl Kurlander is also the President and CEO of the Steeltown Entertainment Project, a non-profit whose mission is to build a vibrant and sustainable entertainment industry in Southwestern Pennsylvania (SWPA) In June 2013, Kurlander moderated a panel at the Producers Guild of America's \\"Produced By\\" Conference called \\"Beyond Hollywood: The Promise of Regional Production Centers\\" where he discussed the city of Pittsburgh's efforts to take advantage of the current disruption in Hollywood to develop their own sector of the entertainment industry.

The school's most recent Ofsted inspection judged it to be 'requires improvement'. Admissions Brookfield Community School is a comprehensive secondary school which caters for around 1300 students between the ages 11‚Äì18 (Years 7-13), including approximately 300 sixth formers. Academic performance In the data for the year 2016/2017, the school had a Progress 8 score of -0.14, indicating that pupils at the end of Key Stage 4 had made less progress, on average, than pupils across England who got similar results at the end of Key Stage 2. The same data shows 57% of pupils achieving a GCSE grade 5 or above in English & Maths. History Brookfield Community School's history stretches back to the founding of the Chesterfield Grammar School in 1598. This school taught boys throughout the 17th and 18th century, until its closure in 1832. In 1845, the school was restarted in a new building (which remains on Sheffield Road today, and is now part of Chesterfield College), expanding to a size of around 500 in 1928. Additional land on Storrs Road (on the west side of the town) was acquired in the 1930s, but minimally used due to lack of funds and the Second World War. In 1949, work began on the levelling of playing fields on the site, which was opened in 1953. The present site of Brookfield (on Chatsworth Road/Brookside, adjacent to the Storrs Road playing fields) was opened for Chesterfield School in 1967. Following the Education Act 1944, the school became a state-sponsored grammar school. Brookfield Community School was formed in 1991 in a re-organisation of schools in Chesterfield, On 1 April 2011, Brookfield Community School officially gained academy status.

His film credits include Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Total Recall (1990) and Navy SEALs (1990). Career Gary Goldman's first big screen writing credit was for John Carpenter's fantasy martial arts film, Big Trouble in Little China, which he co-wrote with David Weinstein. Originally set in the old west, the script was later adapted by Carpenter's former classmate at USC film school, W. D. Richter, to take place in modern times. Goldman's next major writing job came in 1989 for the science fiction action film Total Recall, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Originally written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon, director Paul Verhoeven had problems with the third act and hired Goldman to help fix the screenplay. According to the director, the problem was that the last forty minutes of the film was one long action sequence and had abandoned the \\"mental theme.\\" Working with Shusett, Goldman was able to reintroduce this mental theme by adding a plot twist where the audience discovers that Schwarzenegger's character, who is assumed to be a good guy, had his memory wiped and is actually a bad guy. Shortly after the success of Total Recall, Goldman and Shusett co-wrote a screen adaptation of Philip K. Dick's story, The Minority Report, to serve as a possible sequel to the film. Although their screenplay was not used, the 2002 film, Minority Report, has a sequence set in a car factory, which was adapted from their early script. In the end, Goldman didn't receive a writing credit, but was listed as an executive producer of the film. By 2003, Goldman's career had slowed down, and manager Lenny Beckerman suggested that he adapt another Philip K. Dick story. Goldman had a good relationship with the Dick estate and was able to acquire the rights to his 1954 short story, The Golden Man. The completed script was sold to Nicolas Cage's production company, Saturn Films, and eventually became the 2007 film, Next, directed by Lee Tamahori and starring Cage, along with Julianne Moore and Jessica Biel. Unfortunately, the film was not a great critical or financial success. Lawsuit On March 21, 2017, Goldman filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Disney over the film Zootopia. The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled Looney, which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called Zootopia. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings, and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash, and Chief Bogo. A Disney spokesperson described the lawsuit as being \\"ridden with patently false allegations.\\" After months of back-and- forth deliberation between the two parties, U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald dismissed the infringement claims on November 8, 2017. As stated in the final review, \\"...Goldman's effort to make the plots of Looney and Zootopia seem similar were strained. All the purported similarities between the two works were themes, not plot points or sequences of events, that were too general to be protected by copyright law.\\" References External links * Category:American male screenwriters Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Gary Goldman (screenwriter)"},{"id":"7160107","title":"Volero Le Cannet"},{"id":"7160111","text":"Location of Ro≈æ≈àava District in the Ko≈°ice Region Meliata () is a village and municipality in the Ro≈æ≈àava District in the Ko≈°ice Region of middle-eastern Slovakia.

Chiapa de Corzo is an archaeological site of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica located near the small town of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas. It rose to prominence around 700-500 BC, during the Middle Formative period, becoming a regional center. By then, its public precinct had reached 18-20 ha in size, with total settlement approaching 70 ha. Because of its position near Grijalva River in the Central Depression of Chiapas, it controlled the local trade routes.Pool, p. 272. The modern township of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, founded in Colonial times and after which the site was named, is nearby. Site history Chiapa de Corzo and other Formative Period sites, approximately 900 BCE. The site shows evidence of continual occupation since the Early Formative period (ca. 1200 BCE). The mounds and plazas at the site, however, date to approximately 700 BCE with temples and palaces constructed at the end of the Late Formative or Protoclassic period, between 100 BCE and 200 CE.Lowe, p. 122-123.Lowe 1962 In 2008, archaeologists discovered a massive Middle Formative Olmec axe deposit at the base of Chiapa de Corzo's Mound 11 pyramid. This deposit dates to around 700 BCE and is the second one of its kind found in Chiapas after nearby San Isidro. It is associated with one of the earliest E-Group astronomical complexes in Mesoamerica. In April 2010, archaeologists discovered the 2,700-year-old tomb of a dignitary within Mound 11 that is the oldest pyramidal tomb yet discovered in Mesoamerica.In an Ancient Mexican Tomb, High Society New York Times, 17 May 2010One of Mesoamerica's Oldest Tombs Found Los Angeles Times, 25 May 2010BYU-led Team Finds Treasure-filled Tomb in Chiapas Salt Lake Tribune, 21 May 2010Pyramid Tomb Found: Sign of a Civilization's Birth? National Geographic Society, 18 May 2010 According to archaeologist Bruce Bachand, the tomb exhibits Olmec rather than Maya affinities. This tomb predates by 600 years any other such tomb found in Mesoamerica, such as those at Tikal, and at Kaminaljuyu.Discovery of one of Mesoamerica‚Äôs oldest known ancient pyramidal tombs Popular Archaeology Cultural affiliation The site is believed to have been settled by Mixe‚ÄìZoquean speakers, bearers of the Olmec culture that populated the Gulf and Pacific Coasts of southern Mexico. Chiapa de Corzo and a half dozen other western Depression centers appear to have coalesced into a distinct Zoque civilization by 700 BCE, an archaeological culture that became the conduit between late Gulf Olmec society and the early Maya.Clark 2000Lowe 1977Lowe 1999 Certain Mesoamerican traits such as planned cities, earthen pyramids, E-Group commemorative complexes, cloudy-resist waxy pottery, incensarios, and early logographic writing may have originated in the Zoque region. Regional centre Starting around 100 BCE, during its Guanacaste phase, Chiapa de Corzo played the role of the regional capital. The city was linked with other areas across the Maya Lowlands, Maya Highlands, Pacific Coast, and Oaxaca. This is the time when the first hieroglyphic writing appeared on flat stamps, pottery vessels, stelae, and building panels.The Chiapa de Corzo Project chiapadecorzo.byu.edu Maya pottery types began to be included in elite burials, although utilitarian ceramics retained traditional patterns.Pool, p. 272. This has suggested to some researchers, that the Maya culture to the east exerted influence or even control over Chiapa de Corzo, although there seems to be a waning of that Maya influence in the first centuries CE.See discussion in Pool, p. 272. It was during this time that the ancient platform mounds were covered with limestone and stucco. Decline Big changes occurred in the area during the Istmo phase (AD 300-400). There was an economic decline, as craft activity diminished and long-distance ties contracted.The Chiapa de Corzo Project chiapadecorzo.byu.edu Chiapa de Corzo and a number of western Depression sites were abandoned by the Late Classic period, a population change that closely coincides with the invasion of a war like group of Manguean-speaking people known as the Chiapanec.Lowe 2000, p. 122.Navarrete 1966.Warren, pp. 139-144. The Chiapanec chose to occupy the adjacent floodplain of the Grijalva River where the modern town is now located, and they left the Zoque ruin on the nearby plateau untouched. The abandoned city now became a place of pilgrimage.The Chiapa de Corzo Project chiapadecorzo.byu.edu Modern developments The site has been heavily encroached upon over the last 70 years with the construction of roads, homes, businesses, utility systems, and a cemetery. The Nestl√© company constructed a large milk processing plant in the center of the ruin in the late 1960s, removing Mound 17, one of the major ceremonial mounds at the site. In recent years, the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) has purchased sections of the site from local land owners. INAH officially opened a small portion of the ruin to tourists on December 8, 2009. The site is currently under investigation by a collaborative team of researchers from Brigham Young University, INAH-Chiapas, and Mexico's UNAM (see http://chiapadecorzo.byu.edu/). Notable finds pottery from the site Stela 2, showing the date of 7.16.3.2.13, or December 36 BCE, the earliest Mesoamerican Long Count calendar date yet found. Skeleton from Mound 5 on display at the Regional Museum of Anthropology and History of Chiapas. The oldest Mesoamerican Long Count calendar date yet discovered, December 36 BCE, was found on Stela 2 (which is not a stela at all, but rather a misnamed, inscribed wall panel). All that survives of the original text is the day-name and the digits 7.16.3.2.13. Chiapa de Corzo is also notable for a pottery sherd containing what is likely Epi-Olmec script. Dated to as early as 300 BCE, this sherd would be the oldest instance of that writing system yet discovered.Justeson, p. 2. The site possesses possibly the earliest example of a Mesoamerican palace complex in Mound 5.see Lowe 1962 This palace was constructed in the first century CE and ritually destroyed a couple centuries later. More than 250 Formative period burials have been scientifically excavated at Chiapa de Corzo. Many derive from a unique Late Formative burial ground below the Mound 1 plaza. Chiapa de Corzo has the largest and perhaps the best chronologically subdivided Formative period burial sample in southern Mesoamerica. Chiapa de Corzo has more clay cylinder seals and flat stamps than any other Formative Mesoamerican site, save Tlatilco.see Lee 1969 Hieroglyphs appear on examples made around 100 BCE.

The village is situated in a valley oriented from north to south. The eastern mountain chain has its local peak near the village called Nagyhegy, or \\"Big Hill.\\" A river flows through it, called Sajo (in Hungarian). Population It has a population of about 290 people. Most of the village has always been Hungarian speaking. In the second half of the 20th century the portion of gypsy population gradually outgrew in number the rest. A large part of population born after the World War II left the village and moved to towns and cities. Only few remained to work in agriculture. Currently, most of the population is either white and retired, or gypsy and unemployed. Culture The most important building (apart from the pub) is the church. The village has a public library. Economy The village's economy has always been agricultural. With the rise of communism in the second half of the 20th century, individual farmers were more or less forcibly consolidated in a local collective farm (similar to Soviet kolchoz). The economic situation of the now private collective farm is uncertain. Some agricultural activity is done by private farmers. There is a small local shop with consumer credit activities and a small local pub, but the pub has been closed down recently, however, because of violence.

Of these, only two bothies (Over Phawhope and Glen Pean) are owned by the charity. The remainder are maintained with the agreement and encouragement of the owners. The majority are in Scotland with the remainder in Wales and Northern England. These may be stayed in without charge. The object of the charity is to maintain simple shelters in remote country for the use and benefit of all who love wild and lonely places. All maintenance work is financed from the MBA's own resources, mainly membership subscriptions supplemented by donations from benefactors, some of whom wish to commemorate a relative or friend who was a hillwalker or climber. Bothies sometimes have an outside toilet but the majority do not. When this is not the case a toilet spade and guidance as to the appropriate disposal of toilet waste are provided within the bothy. Raised platforms or bunks may have been installed for sleeping, but this is not always the case.

Groups of six or more and commercial groups are not allowed.  History  The MBA was founded by Bernard Heath in 1965. He was inspired by a comment by Alan Murdock in the visitors' book at Backhill of Bush. He first organised the restoration that summer of the ruined farmhouse at Tunskeen as an unlocked shelter, and then with Alan called the meeting on 28 December 1965 in Dalmellington at which the MBA was formed, \\"To maintain simple unlocked shelters in remote mountain country for the use of hillwalkers, climbers and other genuine outdoor enthusiasts who love the wild and lonely places\\".Press release by Bernard Heath and Alan Murdock, October 1965 In 1975 the MBA became a registered charity. In 1998, the Association was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee, still remaining a registered charity. , the MBA had a membership of around 4,300. They receive a quarterly newsletter and annual report, but do not have any privileged rights (i.e. the bothies themselves are equally open to all).  Structure  Maintenance Organisers Each bothy has one Maintenance Organiser (or, in some cases, a small team of two or three), who monitor the bothy and arrange routine maintenance. MOs are the lifeblood of the organisation. Area Organisers The UK is divided into nine areas:http://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/cust_images/new%20SO%20section%20D.pdf * Northern Highlands * North West Highlands and Islands * Western Highlands and Islands * Central Highlands * South West Highlands and Islands * Eastern Highlands * Southern Scotland * Northern England and Borders * Wales The Maintenance Organisers of the bothies in each area form the respective Area Committees. Each committee elects an Area Organiser to chair their meetings and to coordinate the work of the Area. Project Organisers Project Organisers run a particular renovation or major maintenance project. This is a short-term responsibility, unlike that of a Maintenance Organiser.  Board of Trustees  The Board of Trustees is directly elected by the members. It has control over the finances and is responsible for managing the company.

The York Minster astronomical clock was installed in the North Transept of York Minster in 1955. It was first conceived in 1944 and designed by R d'E Atkinson, chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The clock is a memorial to the airmen operating from bases in Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland who were killed in action during World War II. Atkinson based the design on the appearance of the sun and stars from the viewpoint of a pilot flying over York. The mechanism and two dials were constructed by A C S Westcott and RGO craftsmen. The grid system of the York Minster astronomical clock. The front dial shows the locations of the sun and certain navigational stars as would be seen by a pilot flying south above York Minster. To locate his position, a fixed circular plate, about 62 cm in diameter and slightly dished, carries a ground plan of the Minster and surrounding markings representative of city walls, rivers, and principal roads. Since the edge of the plate represents the effective horizon, its centre identifies the pilot's nadir. Mounted behind the plate is a star-planisphere, based on a north pole stereographic zenithal projection (a projection from the north pole onto a plane passing through the south pole and perpendicular to the solar axis). This rotates once in a sidereal day on an axis passing through its south celestial pole and located some 13 cm above the centre of the horizon plate. For decoration it carries a few basic star patterns (considerably distorted owing to the projection used) and an eccentric zodiac/ecliptic/calendar ring faced with silver, and restricted in width to the distance between the solstitial points. Associated with the ring is a rayed apparent-sun emblem whose supporting arm system moves to and fro relative to a main mean-motion arm by an amount corresponding to the equation of time, and also radially to represent changes in the sun's declination. Sun-emblem and horizon-plate therefore combine to show the times of the sun's rising, southing, and setting throughout the year and, by means of the 'rays', the extent of the twilight. To complete the front dial display, two sets of curved wires are mounted in front of the planisphere. One set of two wires indicates lines of equal altitude 36¬∞ and 59.5¬∞ and supplements the edge of the horizon plate (altitude 0); they cross a vertical north-south wire to indicate the sun's meridian altitude at the equinoxes and solstices respectively. The second set, in addition to the north-south element, forms a complete circle and the sectors of two larger circles; all four wires intersect at the centre of the horizon plate (nadir) and a point near the top of the north-south line (zenith). The planisphere is attached to a large wheel driven by a worm gear, which is connected to a gear box containing the wheel- train. The gear wheels have ratios 45/29, 71/151, and 257/187, producing a solar to sidereal ratio of 821115 to 818873 ((45 x 71 x 257 ) to (29 x 151 x 187)). This produces a value for the mean tropical year of 365.24219447. The worm gear serving the similar wheel of the mean-sun arm is connected to the input end of the gear box, and also, through a 3000:1 reduction gear, to a 1500 rpm synchronous electric motor running off the main electricity supply. For the equation correction, a wheel on a lever associated with the mean solar arm rolls round an annular cam of sheet brass about 61 cm in diameter. Beneath the planisphere, three small dials show hours, minutes, and seconds of Greenwich Mean Time, and three similar and balancing dials give local sidereal time in degrees, minutes, and seconds of arc. An aperture indicates the name of the day of the week. The rear planisphere, similar in size to the one in the front but strictly circular, displays the brightest stars of the main circumpolar constellations (Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, and Cassiopeia). It is centred on the north celestial pole and, with its encircling silvered ring of 24-hour intervals, rotates once a sidereal day relative to a fixed meridian- index. Damage to the clock's mechanism was sustained during the fire of 9 July 1984; after 10 years' reparation work, vergers ceased winding it owing to inaccuracies of time-keeping.

Biography Born in Haarlem, Cornelis Corneliszoon was a pupil of Pieter Pietersz in Haarlem, and later Gillis Coignet in Antwerp.Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem in the RKD He is known among art historians as a member of the Haarlem Mannerists, who were highly influenced by the work of Bartholomeus Spranger, whose drawings were brought to Haarlem by Carel van Mander in 1585, and had a strong immediate effect.Slive, 8 He painted mainly portraits as well as mythological and Biblical subjects. Initially Cornelis Cornelisz painted large-size, highly stylized works with Italianate nudes in twisted poses with a grotesque, unnatural anatomy. Later, his style changed to one based on the Netherlandish realist tradition. When his parents fled Haarlem, as the Spanish army laid siege to the city in 1573 during the Eighty Years' War, Cornelis Cornelisz remained behind and was raised by the painter Pieter Pietersz the Elder, his first teacher. Later, in 1580-1581 Corneliszoon studied in Rouen, France, and Antwerp (with Coignet), before returning to Haarlem, where he stayed the rest of his life. He became a respected member of the community and in 1583 he received his first official commission from the city of Haarlem, a militia company portrait, the Banquet of the Haarlem Civic Guard. He later became city painter of Haarlem and received numerous official commissions. As a portrait painter, both of groups and individuals, he was an important influence on Frans Hals. He married Maritgen Arentsdr Deyman, the daughter of a mayor of Haarlem, sometime before 1603. In 1605, he inherited a third of his wealthy father-in-law's estate. Works Together with Carel van Mander, Hendrick Goltzius and other artists, he started an informal drawing school that has become known in art history circles as the Haarlem Academy or \\"Haarlem Mannerists\\". Probably this was a very informal grouping, perhaps meeting to draw nude models, and certainly to exchange artistic views. Corneliszoon also played a role in the failed attempt to make a new charter for the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1630, which tried to raise the status of the artists. His registered pupils were Salomon de Bray, Cornelis Jacobsz Delff, Cornelis Engelsz, and Gerrit Pietersz Sweelink. Among his students was Cornelis Claesz Heda (brother of Willem Claeszoon Heda), who seems to have exported Cornelisz' particular brand of mannerism to India, where he was active at the court of the sultan of Bijapur.Gijs Kruijtzer,Xenophobia in Seventeenth-Century India (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2009), 21 Paintings by him are on display at the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Louvre in Paris, the National Gallery in London, the Hermitage in St. Petersburg and other museums.

Butterworth has a population of 45,900 and is situated on the N2 national highway 111 km north of East London.Butterworth, Travelblog p.1 - 2Tony Pinchuck, Barbara McCrea & Donald Reid, Rough guide to South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland, Edition 3, Rough Guides, 2002. p. 425  History  The area around Butterworth was populated by amaXhosa, KhoiKhoi and San people. Butterworth was first established as a Wesleyan mission station in 1827 north of the Great Kei River in British Kaffraria.British Kaffraria, map. It was named after Joseph Butterworth. The mission station and white settlement of Butterworth was burnt down 3 times during the Cape Frontier Wars. Nonetheless, it is one of the oldest white settlements in Eastern Cape. When the British seized the Cape of Good Hope, many of the Boers trekked north to establish their own republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886) in South Africa spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the native inhabitants. The town was close to the seat of Hintsa ka Khawuta, the King of the Xhosa people. It was of great strategic importance. Around that time, a young girl, Nongqawuse, had a vision that her forebears would help the Xhosa drive the English out. The disastrous result weakened the Xhosa. The Ninth Frontier War spelled the end of the Xhosa, and the Transkei area was incorporated into the Cape Colony. But it was never quiet. There were raids between settlers and Xhosa, and turf wars between different Xhosa groups. Missions were established here and there to try to bring Christianity to the local people, with limited success.Jeffrey B. Peires, The dead will arise, Indiana University Press, 1989. pp 141 -159 Butterworth is the birthplace of Marmaduke Pattle, the highest scoring RAF ace of World War 2. At the end of the Frontier Wars in 1878, traders began to settle here and the town has grown to become a small industrial centre. Butterworth became a municipality of the Cape Colony in 1904. The town was incorporated into the former Transkei bantustan during the apartheid years. It is one of the fastest growing towns in terms of the economy and the population.Hazel Crampton, The Sunburnt Queen, Jacana Media, 2004. pp 60 - 63 Currently Butterworth is home to nine townships.  Demographics  The town is predominantly Black and Xhosa- speaking. According to the 2001 South African census, the \\"main place\\" of Butterworth had a population of 45,900. Of these, 45,142 (98.4%) were recorded as \\"Black\\", 345 (0.8%) as \\"Coloured\\", 213 (0.5%) as \\"Indian or Asian\\" and 200 (0.4%) as White. The most common language spoken at home was Xhosa (96.9%), followed by English (1.7%) and Afrikaans (0.5%). The town is 57% Female and 43% Male.  Economy  Butterworth is the main service area for Mnquma municipality, contributing 77% of the GDP in the municipality and is an important town in the new South Africa. It now has several major industrial sites, including Zitulele and Ibeka, on its outskirts. Its industries produce processed food, beverages, tobacco products, beer, textiles, clothing, leather goods, wood and wood products, chemicals, rubber and plastic products. It is on the Mthatha-East London railway line, but rarely sees a passenger train. This may change when the Bhisho government gets a main line passenger rail service operational. Butterworth's town area is relatively small, including a small business district of middle-to-high income housing. The central town, established exclusively ‚Äúwhite‚Äù before 1976, has since been occupied largely by black high-income groups. White occupancy has not been re-established post-1994. Development in Butterworth has followed the line of the N2 and thus resulted in a long, narrow settlement east of town towards Walter Sisulu University (WSU), about 5 km away. The N2 also runs through the CBD, which results in a clash of uses and congestion, with high speed road transport seeming to use the same space as pedestrians, hawkers and public service functions.Butterworth, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica p.1 Butterworth, Aspire 2008 p 1 Butterworth is also home to the first shopping centre in the area. October 24 and 25 2012 saw the much-awaited launch of the Fingoland Mall Fingoland Mall Website development in the small town of Butterworth. Fingoland Mall extends over 12,700m2, which is less than half of the total footprint of the shopping centre when complete after the third and last phase is built. As of December 2014, there were 51 tenants, which includes but is not limited to major national retailers, as well as accommodating no less than 10 micro- businesses. On completion of the third phase, Fingoland Mall is expecting a minimum total of 100 shops. The development has already created approximately 350 jobs, and by the end of the third phase, the total number of jobs created is expected to reach 1000.  Tourism  Tourist attractions include Bawa Falls, Birding, Cape Vulture Colony, Collywobbles on Mbashe River, Gcuwa River Cascades and various historical sights. Butterworth is surrounded by beautiful countryside. Visitors can go for day walks to the nearby villages such as Tobashana and experience the hospitality of traditional Xhosa living. Gcuwa Dam provides for a man-made lake for boating and fishing. Nearby Bawa Falls on the Qolorha River, has a sheer drop of nearly 300 ft. The dirt road leading to the falls is just west of the town. Winding through the Transkei countryside, little has changed in the past 100 years. The district's scenery is attractive with its almost ever-green thorn trees and tropical flowers. Bawa Falls has a popular picnic spot and more adventurous hikers can camp overnight. The Cascades Falls on the Gcuwa (Butterworth) River has a reputed fall of 270 ft. Butterworth is the starting point for a number of nature walks.

Christianity in one form or another is accepted by most people today. Cultural traditionalists are likely to belong to independent denominations that combine Christianity with traditional beliefs and practices. The Church of the Province of Southern Africa has played an important role in the life of the Butterworth community. Today, retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu is seen as a significant spiritual leader. St Peter's Church is a beautiful example of 19th Century colonial architecture.  Hospitals  Butterworth has two provincial hospitals: Butterworth Hospital in the central town is the main hospital serving the people of Dutywa, Willowvale, Centane and Butterworth; and Tafalofefe Hospital in the rural district about 15km east of Butterworth.

Pike (1940 ‚Äì January 12, 2019) was an American agricultural scientist who established the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas A&M; University in 1992 and created the 1015 sweet onion and the BetaSweet maroon carrot. Pike was born and raised in Arkansas. He attended the University of Arkansas, where he received a master's degree in 1964. Three years later, he was granted a Ph.D. from Michigan State University. Shortly after graduation, he joined the faculty at Texas A&M; University. At A&M;, Pike focused his research on cucumbers, onions, and carrots, using selective cross-breeding techniques to create new or hardier varieties. His research led to cucumbers that would ripen on the vine simultaneously, and that were stronger and better able to survive the machine picking process. He then created a variety of seedless cucumber. In 1977, Texas onion growers asked him to help them to create a variety of onion that would better withstand disease and that they would be able to harvest in winter, a typically barren time of year for the Texas onion crops. Over the next four years, Pike was able to create hardier versions. He then turned his focus to creating single-centered onions, which would be easier to use to make onion rings. Pike and his graduate students tested their onions by frying them up as onion rings. The research results in the 1015 variety of sweet onions, which became one of the most popular varieties of onion sold in the United States. Pike's onion was named the official Texas state vegetable in 1997 and is estimated to provide $350 million per year to the Texas economy, as of 2013. The onion became a staple in the blooming onions sold by Outback Steakhouse. The Outback restaurant in College Station, Texas hung a picture of Pike on the wall to thank him for his efforts. For his creation of the 1015 onion, Pike won the Southwest Man of the Year in Agriculture Award. In 1992, Pike founded the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas A&M.; He served as the director of the center until his retirement in 2006. The center focused on developing foods that are healthier for humans, not just prettier or stronger and often partnered with the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas to determine which varieties had more cancer-fighting compounds. One of the results was the BetaSweet carrot, a maroon carrot (to match the Texas A&M; school color) which has fifty percent more beta-carotene than a typical carrot.

On 1 April 2019, HSA's food related duties were absorbed by its successor Singapore Food Agency (SFA) which also absorbed the food related duties of two other statutory boards namely Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and National Environment Agency (NEA). SFA is a statutory board under the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources. Overview HSA is a multi- disciplinary agency. It applies medical, pharmaceutical and scientific expertise to protect and advance public health and safety. The organisation serves three key functions: It is the national regulator for health products; it secures the national blood supply through its operation of the national blood bank - Bloodbank@HSA; and it represents the national expertise in forensic medicine, forensic science and analytical chemistry testing capabilities. These support other regulatory and compliance agencies in the administration of justice and in safeguarding public health. Background The Health Sciences Authority headquarters at Outram Road, Singapore. HSA was formed on 1 April 2001 with the integration of five specialised agencies under the Ministry of Health: the Centre for Drug Evaluation; Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine; National Pharmaceutical Administration; Product Regulation Department; and Singapore Blood Transfusion Service. Today, the agency's professional knowledge, skills and competencies are housed in three professional groups: the Health Products Regulation Group; Blood Services Group, and Applied Sciences Group. Each group functions as Divisions comprising branches, units and laboratories. The three professional groups work with the Corporate Services Group which provides strategic direction and corporate support in advancing the organisation. Role Health Products Regulation The Health Products Regulation Group ensures that medicines, innovative therapeutics, medical devices and health-related products are wisely regulated and meet appropriate safety, quality and efficacy standards. The agency also contributes to the development of biomedical sciences in Singapore by administering a robust, scientific and responsive regulatory framework. HSA's risk management system takes into account pre-and-post market precautionary options. On the pre-market front, HSA administers clinical trials for new drugs and grants approvals for these products before they are marketed in Singapore. Audits on good manufacturing and distribution practices are also conducted. Regulation group would evaluate the medical device to determine whether it's acceptable to enter market. The medical device is classified as 4 levels according the product risk from Class A to Class D. On the post-market front, HSA monitors health products in the market through regular surveillance activities. The agency also carries out investigations and takes enforcement action against illegal activities related to unregistered, counterfeit and adulterated health products. HSA has an established and active pharmacovigilance programme that draws on its network of healthcare professionals and overseas regulators. This allows HSA to initiate targeted and prompt action in response to reported adverse drug reports and expedite the isolation of such problems and minimise harm to public health and safety. In support of the national objective to reduce smoking, HSA enforces the laws that prohibit tobacco advertisements, smoking by youths under 21 years old as well as the sale of tobacco products to youths in this age group, as well as banning sales of emerging tobacco products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. National Blood Service The Blood Services Group is the national blood service of Singapore and is responsible for the adequacy and safety of the country's blood supply. It runs the Bloodbank@HSA in Outram, as well as three satellite blood banks ‚Äì Bloodbank@Woodlands, Bloodbank@DhobyGhaut and Bloodbank@WestgateTower ‚Äì which collects, processes, tests and distributes blood and blood components to all hospitals in Singapore. The agency has established a framework to ensure that there is a steady supply of safe blood for day-to-day needs at hospitals and during emergencies. The framework covers the recruitment of voluntary non- remunerated blood donors, stringent blood donation screening criteria, a reliable battery of tests that is conducted on all collected blood, and a comprehensive quality system benchmarked against stringent internationally recognised standards. The HSA has maintained a strategic partnership with the Singapore Red Cross since 2001 in managing the National Blood Donor Recruitment and Retention Programme. The agency offers immunohaematology services and tissue typing services to local and regional healthcare institutions, as well as clinical consultative services in the specialty of transfusion medicine. In addition, the agency's cell therapy facility enables one-stop access to cell manufacturing and clinical trial implementation, blood processing and testing services. Forensic and Analytical Sciences Expertise HSA's Applied Sciences Group represents Singapore's national expertise in forensic medicine, forensic sciences, analytical scientific capabilities as well as chemical metrology. This Group supports other regulatory and compliance agencies in the administration of justice and safeguarding public health. The Group comprises: Analytical Science (Chemical Metrology, Food Safety, and Pharmaceutical Divisions), Forensic Medicine and Forensic Science (Biology, Forensic Chemistry & Physics, Illicit Drugs and Analytical Toxicology Divisions). The range of services cover forensic medical consultancy services in support of death investigation in Singapore; forensic science services such as criminalistics and DNA profiling in support of criminal investigations and illicit drugs control; analytical testing in support of health products regulation, cigarette and tobacco product control; water testing; and food safety testing. Toxicological services are also provided to hospitals.

Interdiscursivity is the aspect of a discourse that relates it to other discourses. Norman Fairclough prefers the concept \\"orders of discourse\\". Interdiscursivity is often mostly an analytic concept, e.g. in Foucault and Fairclough. Interdiscursivity has close affinity to recontextualisation because interdiscourse often implies that elements are imported from another discourse. The meaning of interdiscourse varies. It denotes at least three levels: # In Courtine interdiscursivity means that a discourse has a relation to another discourse. That is, a meaning which is close to the meaning of intertextuality. # In Norman Fairclough and Linell interdiscursive denotes relations between types of discourse such as genres. # In Michel Foucault and Marc Angenot, interdiscursive constellation/configuration interdiscursive, Foucault 1969: 88, 206-8 denotes relations between discursive formations, that is, between large heterogeneous discursive entities, such as natural history and political economy during enlightenment. In Michel Foucault, interdiscourse is differences and equalities across discursive formations. An example (where 1. corresponds to a., etc.) illustrates the three levels: A minister of environment speaks in the parliament about a proposal. *a. She refers to other specific speeches in the parliament about the proposal. *b. She refers to a memorandum from her civil servants. *c. She refers to scientific reports supporting the proposal. The example illustrates that 2. and 3. are specific cases of 1, in the sense a-c all relate to another discourse. To avoid this, level 1. might be defined as relations to other discourses within the same discursive formation and type of discourse. Consequently, the definition of the levels depends on the definition of discursive formation and types of discourse, and the three levels may collapse to the extent that these concepts are not conceived. In short, the stratification of interdiscourse depends on the stratification of discourse. Power, ideology and interdiscursive configuration Level 2. and 3. may be conceived as particularly salient. This is explained in Marc Angenot and Bruce by reference to Bakhtin: In Bakhtin's dialogism, the utterance is the natural meaningful and finalised unit of speech, which others are supposed to respond to, that is, others interpret the utterance by situating it in a discursive context. But, an utterance may be interpreted (contextualised) in various ways, and interdiscourse and interdiscursivity denote how certain such interpretations (and relations to other discourses) are socially more privileged than others. Since interdiscourse privileges certain interpretations, it has a close affinity to the concepts of ideology, hegemony and power (sociology). For Bakhtin/Voloshinov, signs are a reality that refracts another reality, that is, signs are ideological.Voloshinov 1973: 10 Therefore, the embedding of a discourse in an interdiscourse is an ideological interpretation of the discourse. In Michel Foucault, interdiscursivity is not bound to ideology, but is a more open concept for analysing relations between discursive formations, that is, mapping their interdiscursive configuration. Such analyses constitute a part of his discourse analysis.Foucault 1969: 88-90 The cogent and restrictive character of the interdiscourse is reflected in the concept of the primacy of interdiscourse.Maingueneau 1991: 20 The interdiscourse is the sayable, the opposite of what cannot be enunciated (l'in√©noncable). But, the interdiscourse has also primacy in the sense that it defines the relations between discursive entities (or formations) that are constitutive of the discursive entities. What is acceptable discourse, is in many respects a matter of interdiscursivity at level 2 and 3, because the interdiscursive import and export relations constitute a worksharing between the discursive entities, and this frames what is acceptable discourse within each discursive entity: Generally, a discourse has little authority over what other discourses are assumed to speak of and will therefore accept imported form and content from the other discourses. On the other hand, when a discourse exports content to other discourses, there are expectations as to the exported form and content. Thus, the interdiscursive system shapes the discourses.

Published by Private Eye The principal publications are anthologies, for example the Private Eye Annual, and ongoing series such as the Colemanballs collections (in even-numbered years), and diaries of the Prime Minister. \\"The Private Eye Annual\\" has been published in a variety of forms since the early 1970s and traditionally contains reprints from the middle section of the magazine; satirical articles and cartoons. The magazine has reprinted several hard- hitting articles and made them available as separate pamphlets. One such article was their report on the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom, and the response the government gave to it. In former years, the magazine published collections of their strip cartoons. In particular, The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, the exploits of an uncouth Australian expatriate in Sixties London, written by Barry Humphries and illustrated by Nicholas Garland, was published in three collections, long since out of print and now collectors' items. The Bill Tidy strip The Cloggies was also issued in this form.

The library holds more than 5 million books, and is located on the Givat Ram campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The National Library owns the world's largest collections of Hebraica and Judaica, and is the repository of many rare and unique manuscripts, books and artifacts. As of August 2020, it is closing due to the financial and national government crisis. History B'nai Brith library (1892-1925) B'nai Brith library, Jerusalem The establishment of a Jewish National Library in Jerusalem was the brainchild of Joseph Chazanovitz (1844-1919). His idea was creating a \\"home for all works in all languages and literatures which have Jewish authors, even though they create in foreign cultures.\\" Chazanovitz collected some 15,000 volumes which later became the core of the library.Melancholy Pride: Nation, Race and Gender in the German Literature of Cultural Zionism, Mark Gelber The B'nai Brith library, founded in Jerusalem in 1892, was the first public library in Palestine to serve the Jewish community. The library was located on B'nai Brith street, between the Meah Shearim neighborhood and the Russian Compound. Ten years later, the Bet Midrash Abrabanel library, as it was then known, moved to Ethiopia Street. Hebrew University library (1925-2007) In 1920, when plans were drawn up for the Hebrew University, the B'nai Brith collection became the basis for a university library. The books were moved to Mount Scopus when the university opened five years later. In 1948, when access to the university campus on Mount Scopus was blocked, most of the books were moved to the university's temporary quarters in the Terra Sancta building in Rehavia. By that time, the university collection included over one million books. For lack of space, some of the books were placed in storerooms around the city. In 1960, they were moved to the new JNUL building in Givat Ram. In the late 1970s, when the new university complex on Mount Scopus was inaugurated and the faculties of Law, Humanities and Social Science returned there, departmental libraries opened on that campus and the number of visitors to the Givat Ram library dropped. In the 1990s, the building suffered from maintenance problems such as rainwater leaks and insect infestation. National Library status (2007) In 2007 the library was officially recognized as The National Library of the State of Israel after the passage of the National Library Law. The law, which came into effect on 23 July 2008, changed the library's name to \\"National Library of Israel\\" and turned it temporarily to a subsidiary company of the University, later to become a fully independent community interest company, jointly owned by the Government of Israel (50%), the Hebrew University (25%) and other organizations. Online library (2011) In 2011, the library launched a website granting public access to books, periodicals, maps, photos and music from its collections.Israel's National Library puts collection online New building In 2014, the project for a new home of the Library in Jerusalem was unveiled.Herzog & de Meuron to Design the National Library of Israel, ArchDaily, 29 April 2013 The 34,000 square meters building, designed by the Basel-based architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, is scheduled for full completion in 2021.Herzog & de Meuron Share New Images of the National Library of Israel, ArchDaily, 14 April 2016 Closure (2020) As of August, 2020, the National Library is about to be closed down \\"until further notice\\" due to the ongoing financial and government crisis.Hen, Yitzhak, Israel's National Library Is Closing Down.

He served as Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Iraq and Head of Mission in Iran in 1978, 1980, and 1981. He began his career in the Pakistan Army and rose to the rank of Brigadier. He later transferred into the civil service. He obtained his early education from the Prince of Wales Military Academy. He attended the Staff College at Camberley in the United Kingdom, and specialized training in Diplomacy at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. He is also a graduate of the Infantry School, Ft. Benning and the Command and General Staff College, Ft. Leavenworth, USA. He hails from a well known judicial family of Kasur in Punjab. His grandfather Khan Bahadur Moula Baksh retired as a District and sessions judge. The late Khan Bahadur had an impressive collection of law books that he donated to various institutions in Lahore that are in use even today. His father Mr. S.M. Mir BA Cantab Bar-at-Law also served as District and Sessions Judge and later was appointed as Prime Minister in the princely state of Tonk. The Late S.M. Mir introduced important reforms in the state and helped under privileged students to avail higher studies by providing state scholarships. During his army career in 1965 he commanded a battalion in Bagh sector Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and in 1971 during the Indo-Pak war he commanded an infantry brigade and received many commendations for setting a personal example of leading his troops and for his exemplary conduct in securing the strategic objectives entrusted to him (2) Tariq Mir served as head of the Pakistani mission during the historic Iranian revolution. Through his efforts Pakistan became the first country to recognize the new regime on February 11, 1979, reciprocating the Iranian gesture of being the first country to recognize the newly established state of Pakistan in 1947. During the first Gulf War while Ambassador in Iraq he helped in the successful and safe evacuation of thousands of Pakistanis displaced from Kuwait. While Ambassador in Sri Lanka he was able to greatly strengthen bilateral as well as trade ties. During his tenure a series of high level exchange of visits took place. Both the President and Prime Minister of Sri Lanka visited Pakistan while the President of Pakistan paid a state visit to Sri Lanka. As the head of delegation at the Colombo Plan countries meeting in Australia he was able to successfully advocate the need for greater north south technical collaboration.

History  In 1986, Parkettes' gymnasts took the 1st (Jennifer Sey), 2nd (Hope Spivey) and 4th (Alyssa Solomon) places at the United States National Gymnastics Championships. At the 1988 Olympic Games, Parkettes- trained gymnast Hope Spivey represented the United States. In 1992, Parkettes' gymnast Kim Kelly caused a considerable controversy in that after she was selected for the 1992 Olympic gymnastics training squad, she was then not selected for the competition team extremely close to the opening of the games. In 1998 and 1999, Kristen Maloney won the United States National senior All- Around gold. In 2000, she competed at the Olympics, winning a bronze medal. Kristal Uzelac won the United States Junior National All-Around gold in 1999, 2000, and 2001. In 2002, Vanessa Meloche, a Canadian gymnast at Parkettes, finished third at the Canadian championships and first on the uneven bars. Media coverage In 2003, CNN produced a documentary, Achieving the Perfect 10, which contained some criticisms of the demanding and competitive nature of Parkettes' training program. In 2008, Jennifer Sey, the 1986 National Champion from Parkettes, published a book, Chalked Up, which was critical of Parkettes and elite gymnastics.

An epigram on the pedestal of an obelisk at the hippodrome of Constantinople records his success in setting the obelisk upright.Anthol. Graec. iv. 17. A Latin translation of the epigram by Hugo Grotius is given by Fabricius.Bibl. Graec. vol. ix. p. 368.  Biography  Latin legend on the Obelisk of Theodosius, celebrating the erection of the obelisk in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, performed by Proculus in 388, in occasion of Theodosius I's victory over the usurper Magnus Maximus. Proculus was the son of Eutolmius Tatianus. He held the posts of governor of Palestine and of Phoenicia; between 383 and 384 he was Comes Orientis. During this time, his name was carved on the Commemorative stela of Nahr el-Kalb. In 388, shortly before leaving for a campaign in the West against the usurper Magnus Maximus, Emperor Theodosius I appointed him praefectus urbi of Constantinople. In 392 he fell into disgrace: the general and statesman Rufinus, jealous of the power of Proculus and of his father (who was praetorian prefect of the East), used his influence to launch accusations against Proculus, who went into hiding. Rufinus then coaxed Tatianus and Theodosius to pardon Proculus, who received a letter from his father asking him to return to court. Once Proculus turned up, he was captured and imprisoned. He was tried and sentenced, as Rufinus had decided, and sent to death in a suburb of Constantinople called Sykai (the Galata district of modern Istanbul); the Emperor sent a messenger to order the execution halted, but Rufinus ordered the messenger to move slowly, so that he arrived after the execution had been carried out. His name was subject to damnatio memoriae and was erased from monuments, as, for example, the Obelisk of Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. Later, his nephew, who came to power under the Emperor Marcian (r. 450‚Äì457), had the good name of Proculus restored, re- carving it on the obelisk.

He first appeared in the 1978 film Superman: The Movie portrayed by actor and former boxer Jack O'Halloran. The character made his comic book debut in Action Comics #845 (January 2007). An accomplice of General Zod and an adversary of the superhero Superman, he is typically depicted as having been imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, along with Zod and Ursa, among whom he is portrayed as the strong and silent muscle. In television, the character was portrayed by Chris Vance in Supergirl as the antagonist of the first season. Character biography In October 2006, film director Richard Donner, noted for his work on the first two Superman movies, began to write Action Comics in collaboration with Geoff Johns. After an unidentified Kryptonian boy crash lands in Metropolis and is taken in by Lois Lane and Clark Kent, he is followed by three more Kryptonians in identical vessels: General Zod and Ursa (who claim the boy as theirs) as well as Non. In these comics, Non is portrayed as being more bulky than in the Superman II movie but maintaining the same personality. It was revealed that Non was a friend to Jor-El, as well as a member of the Kryptonian Council, while they discovered Krypton's instability. After leading a separatist movement, Non was abducted by the Science Council and lobotomized, leading to his current status as a minimally- verbal brute. Although a now highly aggressive and mentally lacking enforcer for Zod, Non has apparently retained a level of his old personality and kindness, when dealing with young children. In another Action Comics Annual, it is explained that after Zod and Ursa give birth to their son (who would later become known as Christopher Kent), Non behaved not only docile but caring towards Chris during his early childhood.Action Comics Annual #10 After being re-imprisoned in the Phantom Zone by Superman and Chris, Zod, Ursa, and Non once again returned to the Prison. Unknown to the first two, Chris took secret refuge in the prison with only Non aware of him. Non continued to behave as a protective caretaker towards Chris, bringing him food and hiding him from his parents. When Chris was at last found and tortured by his parents, another Kryptonian, Thara Ak-Var, arrived to rescue Chris; Non was quick to help them as a final act of his humanity and kindness. Non is punished for this act and made an aspirant in the Kryptonian military under lieutenant Asha Del-Nar, in a unit designated Red Shard. Superman is placed into the Military Guild, named Commander of the Red Shard unit. Superman finds the other Aspirants are forcing Non to fight a wild animal as a hazing, which he stops. Since this he has been loyal to Kal-El. When trying to round up some wild thought-beasts, Non sees himself holding a young girl. Powers and abilities While on Earth in the Superman II movie, Non had superhuman strength, virtual invulnerability, superhuman speed, flight, marginal heat vision, and super breath. Non stands at 6'6\\" and is exceptionally muscled which further augments his superhuman strength to a degree. In recent comics, Richard Donner has portrayed Non's strength as greater than that of General Zod and Ursa put together due to his greater size and muscle mass, possibly outmatching that of Superman and other mature Kryptonians; yet Non is neither as intelligent nor as brutal as the other two and thus cannot exert the full measure of his superhuman strength nor can he improvise its use. The movie version of Non is a birth-defect mute (although his comic-book alter-ego, Kru- El, spoke whole sentences) and appears to also be less intelligent than General Zod and Ursa; as stated by Jor-El, \\"His only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction.\\" Additionally, similar to Zod and other Kryptonian Phantom Zone escapees, Non rarely has enough time beneath the yellow sun of Earth to absorb and metabolize enough yellow sunlight to experience the full measure of his abilities as he and the other escapees are typically always defeated and banished back to the Zone before any significant length of time passes. As such, if Non was allowed enough time in the Sun to fully charge his cells with yellow solar energy, he would be significantly more physically powerful and more potent with superhuman strength than any other adult Kryptonian, possibly even Superman. Like all Kryptonians, he is vulnerable to Kryptonite as well as the light of a red sun; he may be vulnerable to magic and mind control as well due to the raw physical nature of his Kryptonian virtual invulnerability, though this has never been seen. An atomic bomb would also cause significant injury to his body and can prove fatal if unrelenting. Despite his great size and strength, he is still insufficient in a battle against the likes of Doomsday and his superhuman speed is insufficient compared to Speedsters like the Flash. Additionally, his relatively low intelligence and apparent lack of cognitive ability puts him at many disadvantages in a battle, though he can competently follow issued orders. Non's accelerated healing factor may be deficient to a degree as his muteness did not improve upon entering the empowering and rejuvenating environment of a yellow sun. In other media Television * Non appears in Supergirl portrayed by Chris Vance as one of the primary antagonists of the first season, alongside his wife Astra. Unlike the comics, he is an articulate speaker. He is also the husband and second-in-command of Astra, twin sister of Supergirl's mother, Alura Zor-El. As in the comics, he led a separatist movement on Krypton before being apprehended. Non was imprisoned with his wife in the Phantom Zone when Krypton was destroyed, and he, his wife, and an army of other aliens managed to escape the Phantom Zone when Kara Zor-El's pod first crashes into Earth. Astra leads them with the intention of saving Earth from humanity, but for years they are hunted by the American government's DEO, while Kara Zor-El, known as Kara Danvers on Earth, grows up. Once Kara takes on the mantle of Supergirl, she aids her adoptive sister Alex Danvers, DEO agent, in hunting the Phantom Zone escapees. Non pressures Astra to proceed with her plan to \\"save\\" the Earth, despite her knowing that she must kill her niece Kara to succeed. After Astra is killed at the hands of Alex Danvers, Non takes command of the remaining Kryptonians and sets out to do her bidding. Working now with the villainous Indigo, Non decides to proceed with Project Myriad, a Kryptonian program that enables mind control of masses and blocks off ideas of hope and saving. With Supergirl having freed the citizens of National City from the effect, Non decides to take the project a step further and destroy the craniums of every human on Earth. However, before the two can execute their genocidal plan completely, Non and Indigo face Supergirl and her ally Martian Manhunter. As the Manhunter takes on Indigo, Supergirl and Non fight and end up locked in a battle of heat vision. Despite Non overcoming Supergirl's heat vision initially, her emotions soon help Supergirl unleash her full potential, burning his eyes in the process, resulting in his death. * Non appears in the 2019 animated series DC Super Hero Girls, episode \\"#DCSuperHeroBoys\\" (Part 1 and 2). He was sent to the Phantom Zone (along with Zod and Ursa) by Kara‚Äôs biological mother, Alura Zor-El. Upon escaping, he is distracted by Green Arrow and Zatanna by seeing a magic trick, until being sent to the Phantom Zone being weakened with Kryptonite. Film Non initially appeared in the first two Superman films, Superman: The Movie and Superman II. Superman At the beginning of Superman, Non is one of the three Kryptonian criminals, along with General Zod and Ursa, on trial for their attempted coup against the Kryptonian government. With Jor-El as their prosecutor, the three are found guilty and sentenced to be imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. They are cast into the Phantom Zone portal shortly before the planet Krypton is destroyed. Non, lacking the ability to speak, communicates only through occasional whines and moans as well as his penchant for wanton violence. Non's name is mentioned twice during the film Superman II, once in the beginning by the unseen prosecutor during the trial recap and once by Ursa (\\"he's caged Non\\"); Jor-El's only reference to him is to proclaim that he is \\"a mindless aberration, whose only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction.\\" In Superman: The Movie, prior to the destruction of Krypton, the criminals General Zod, Ursa, and Non are sentenced by Jor-El to banishment in the Phantom Zone. Superman II General Zod (Terence Stamp, center), Non (Jack O'Halloran, left), and Ursa (Sarah Douglas, right) in Superman II Lex Luthor, who has managed to escape from jail (with Eve Teschmacher's assistance), has tracked down the Fortress, prior to Superman and Lois' arrival, using an alpha wave detector, and learns from the crystals of Superman's connection to Jor-El and of General Zod. He traces Zod to Washington D.C., and offers to lead Zod to Jor-El's son in exchange for control of Australia. Accepting his offer, the three Kryptonians are directed by Luthor to the offices of the Daily Planet where they abduct Lois. Superman arrives, after having found the misplaced crystal and reversing the transformation process, and attempts to fight the three. Zod realizes Superman cares for the innocent humans and takes advantage of this weakness to force Superman into submission. In order to protect Metropolis, Superman flies off towards his Fortress, with Zod, Ursa, and Non giving chase and carrying Lois and Luthor with them. At the Fortress, Superman attempts to lay one last trap to stop Zod but fails. As Zod holds Superman in submission, Luthor reveals the ability of the Fortress to revert Superman into a human, a punishment that Zod sets forth. When Superman steps into the transformation chamber, the rest of the Fortress is bathed in red light. The three villains realize too late that Superman, knowing of Luthor's treachery, altered the transformation process to expose everyone outside the chamber to the red light, thus canceling Zod, Ursa, and Non's Kryptonian powers. With Lois' help, Superman is able to send the criminals into the bottomless depths of the Fortress. (In deleted scenes, it is revealed that human, presumably Canadian, authorities arrest the now powerless Kryptonians.) The re-edited version of the film called Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut revealed that Superman went back in time a few days where he made sure that General Zod, Ursa, and Non remained in the Phantom Zone. Video games * Non appears in DC Universe Online. * Non appears as a support card in the mobile version of Injustice: Gods Among Us. * In Injustice 2 in Sub-Zero's character ending, Sub-Zero finds himself transported to the Injustice Earth during Brainiac's invasion after Kotal Kahn's retreat from Earthrealm to Outworld. Sub-Zero defeats Brainiac and while the Justice League works on a way to transport him back to Earthrealm he trains the younger members of Batman's Justice League. Unfortunately the League accidentally opens a portal to the Phantom Zone where the tyrannical Superman was imprisoned following Brainiac's defeat. Superman is shown to have joined forces with Kryptonian criminals General Zod, Ursa, and Non who use the portal to escape. Sub-Zero joins forces with the Justice League to battle Superman and his allies. In the ending Batman is shown confronting Non and Ursa, while Supergirl clashes with Zod, and Sub-Zero fights Superman.

In 1947, following another re-organisation, the unit based at the drill hall was renamed The Rangers, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort‚Äôs Own). However, in 1960, after the Rangers amalgamated with the London Rifle Brigade the hall fell vacant. In the 1960s the building was used as an art gallery for the Tate Gallery‚Äôs exhibition of the McAlpine Collection. It started to be used as an arts centre for Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia in 1977, and became a theatre, the Drill Hall, in the 1980s after many years of being used as a rehearsal hall. From 1984, the Drill Hall particularly supported production of theatrical and artistic works with gay and lesbian themes. In 2007, the Drill Hall, with an annual turnover of ¬£1.25 million, was supported with ¬£250,000 of Arts Council funding, but late in 2007, the Arts Council announced it was withdrawing this funding to concentrate its funding on other ventures. (Similar fates befell 194 other arts organisations.)The Drill Hall's future in doubt Rupert Smith, 7 January 2008 Time Out accessed 15 Jan 2008 The Drill Hall was home to The Musical Theatre Academy from 2009 to 2011. The triple threat theatre college is now located at Bernie Grant Arts Centre. In January 2012, RADA acquired the lease of the venue from Central London Arts Ltd, who had run the Drill Hall for 30 years.\\"About RADA News and Press RADA Studios\\" , RADA. Retrieved 2013-05-06. RADA's objectives in acquiring the lease included the possibility of hiring out the central London rehearsal and studio space as a \\"further opportunity for income generation and sustaining the charity as it continues into its second century of operation.\\" Central London Arts then began trading as Outhouse London, with the intention of continuing to produce large-scale theatre and community-theatre events across London and the UK. The entire venue is available for hire from RADA. The 200 seat Studio Theatre has been utilised by the BBC as a studio for recording radio shows, such as Cabin Pressure, in front of a live audience.

Klein Vrystaat seal depicting the Triumviratehttp://www.boerenbrit.com/archives/10965 History From around 1876, a group of Boers lived on land bought from the Swazi king Mbandzeni. In 1886, a formal government was formed, following the adoption of a constitution. King Mbandzeni sold the land but kept his kingdom. He was another son of Mswati II, ruling from 1875 to 1889.Richard M. Patricks. \\"Swazi History Olden Times to 1900\\". SNTC. July 2000. Feb. 26 2008.. This state existed until 1891 when it was incorporated into the South African Republic (Transvaal). The flag of the Klein Vrystaat is identical to the Transvaal , which has four colours: a horizontal red-white-blue with a vertical green stripe near the hoist. The width of the green stripe was equal to the height of the horizontal stripes in the Klein Vrystaat flag and 1.25 times this height in the flag. Little Free State was mainly a European (largely Afrikaner) community located on Swazi-owned land along the kingdom's southwestern border with the Transvaal, which was granted in 1877 by iNgwenyama Mbandzeni Dlamini to two hunters: Joachim Johannes Ferreira and Frans Ignatius Maritz. The land consisted of northeast of the present town of Piet Retief. What Mbandzeni thought he had granted was in the nature of a permanent grazing concession, but Ferreira and Maritz opened up the territory to Afrikaner settlement and subdivided into small farms. Mbandzeni finally gave them the permission to form their own labndla (council), which led to their establishment of a local government, consisting of a president and council, with its own constitution and laws.Allan R. Booth. Historical Dictionary of Swaziland. Second Edition. The Scarecrow Press, Inc. London 2000. pp.150-151. In 1886, the settlers declared their independence as the Little Free State and were able to rebuff Mbandzeni's halfhearted attempts to evict them on the grounds that they had exceeded his mandate. In 1888, Ferreira and Maritz requested that the South African Republic (ZAR) incorporate them into the Transvaal, claiming that Mbandzeni had renounced his authority over them. At that point, Mbandzeni reasserted his sovereignty over the territory and demanded an annual rental payment of ¬£21, but, by then, it was too late. By the terms of the first Swaziland Convention (1890), the Little Free State was incorporated into the ZAR, with the accord of the British, as part of the Piet Retief, Mpumalanga district.Booth. Historical Dictionary of Swaziland Second Edition. The Scarecrow Press, Inc. London 2000. pp.150-151. However, the creation of the Nieuwe Republiek Zuid Afrika in 1884, and the Klein Vrystaat in Swaziland 1886 as a miniature republic. In each case, use was made of tribal warfare among the African population to introduce a small army of Europeans, who, having defeated one of the contenders in the tribal war, exacted their price, in land, from the victor.A.J. Christopher. Land Policy in Southern Africa During the Nineteenth Century. Department of Geography, University of Port Elizabeth. pp.6-7. In addition, the Europeans arrived in greater numbers throughout the 1880s, after the discovery of gold in neighboring Transvaal and at Piggs Peak and Forbes Reef in Swaziland. Mswati's son, Mbandzeni, granted large chunks of his territory in concessions to the new arrivals, emboldening Britain to ignore his claims to most of the rest, and, by the time Swaziland became a protectorate of the South African Republic in 1894, there was precious little land left. After their victory in the Second Anglo-Boer War, Britain assumed control of the territory and retained it until 1968.\\"The Rough Guide to South Africa.\\" Rough Guides. 2007. Feb. 26 2008.. The Swazi saw the Zulus' refusal to allow white farmers, traders and missionaries to penetrate their land, leading to Britain's destruction of the Zulu monarchy in 1879. In the 1880s, King Mbandzeni granted numerous concessions to Boer graziers, and British traders and miners. This amounted to a \\"paper conquest\\" of Swaziland.Patricks. \\"Swazi History Olden Times to 1900\\". SNTC. July 2000. Feb. 26 2008.. After the Zulu War, the Swazis aided the British in dismantling the Pedi Kingdom. In gratitude, Britain promised the Swazis they would retain their independence. This was despite the \\"scramble for Africa\\" in the 1880s.Patricks. \\"Swazi History Olden Times to 1900\\". SNTC. July 2000. Feb. 26 2008.. In 1886 the discovery of gold made the Transvaal the prime force in southern Africa. The Boers demanded British agreement to their expansion either north across the Limpopo (Rhodesia- Zimbabwe) or east through Swaziland (the road to the sea). Britain reversed its position on Swazi independence and by 1894 had allowed the Transvaal to establish control over Swaziland.Patricks. \\"Swazi History Olden Times to 1900\\". SNTC. July 2000.

Early life and education Originally from Toowoomba, Queensland, Lacy spent many of her early years travelling with her family. Her father, then an officer in the army, was posted to Singapore (where Lacy was actually born) twice and Lacy spent a few years at Army schools. Career Ballet and choreography It was in Toowoomba that Lacy attended her first ballet class and very early on exhibited some degree of talent. It wasn't until the family had settled in Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs in the late 70's that Lacy was able to attend ballet classes again. She pursued the art vigorously and at the age of 12 was accepted into the Victorian College of the Arts School of Dance. Lacy decided not to attend instead opting to complete her education at a normal high school whilst pursuing her dance training after school hours. She completed her HSC in 1983 and was again accepted into the VCA for a full-time tertiary education. During her second year Lacy suffered a serious blow to her career plans when she sustained a severe knee injury in a dancing accident. After one year of rehabilitation Lacy found that her ballet career was effectively over. Lacy then set out on a career as a choreographer. She choreographed many a fashion parades in and around Melbourne and many of today's top Australian designers such as Bettina Liano, Peter Alexander and Allanah Hill had Lacy choreograph their parades. It was during a taping for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Lacy was spotted and asked to choreograph and appear in Kylie Minogue's first clip Locomotion in 1987. Television Later that same year whilst dancing on Countdown, Lacy was spotted by Molly Meldrum who asked Lacy to open the show - her performance led to a job on a new show, The Factory on which she appeared weekly as roving reporter. Under the guidance of producers Neill Wilson and James Lipscombe, Lacy began to develop her own characters and sketches some of which include Annette the Librarian, Carlos the Latin Lover, Pixie Snotley entertainment reporter and Belinda the yuppie. A very popular series of biscuit commercials featured all four of these characters. In 1989 the ABC axed The Factory. At the same time the series Countdown was reworked as Countdown Revolution which was produced by Molly Meldrum. In 1990 Lacy was made a host of the show with comedian Mark Little and the show finally began to find its feet. Later that year Mark and Tania were fired from the show when they staged a mock strike. Lacy went on to make appearances on Steve Vizard's Tonight Live but eventually found a home at Channel 9 where she initially starred on a show called Saturday at Ricks. When that show ended Lacy made many humorous appearance on shows like Midday where she famously asked John Hewson (leader of the Liberal party at the time) whether he had an extra 2%. In 2006 and 2007, Lacy starred in the internet/mobile web series created by ish media called \\"Girl Friday\\" where she plays Miss Mann. From 29 to 31 October 2007, Lacy appeared as a sexy Barrister Catherine Michael on Neighbours. The stage After a period at Nine, Lacy left to pursue her own projects. She staged a one-woman, sell-out show entitled All of Me which was premiered at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and then toured it to Sydney and Brisbane. Later the show went to the Edinburgh Comedy Festival where Tania was nominated for a Best Newcomer Award and was shortlisted for the Perrier Award.  Short films  Lacy went on to star in a number of short films such as Titsiana Booberini which she co- wrote. The film received much international acclaim, scoring the director, Robert Luketic, a three-picture deal. She also wrote and starred in Pussy Got Your Tongue? which won her the Nicole Kidman Best Actress award at Tropfest in 1997. Later that year she starred with Ben Mendlesohn in Tangerine Dream, winning the Best Actress Award at the Watch My Shorts Festival. In 2000, Lacy went to Los Angeles where she staged a one-woman show entitled Suburban Refugee - it did an extended run at Theatre Theater in Hollywood. It was during this time that Lacy met her now-husband, motion graphics designer Ole Sturm who was working on Mission: Impossible 2. They got married in the Hollywood Hills in November 2000.  Writing  Since returning to Australia in 2001, Lacy staged another one-woman show at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival entitled Tania Lacy is Coo Coo Bananas but more recently Lacy has remained out of the spotlight, focusing instead on the development of various film and TV scripts for local production company, MoodyStreet Kids, amongst them her \\"Virtually Kitty\\" film and a TV series she has developed with Miho Suzuki Gollings.

Crash summary The flight took off from Adelaide at 11:22. As it entered the area around Melbourne, it came across a heavy cloud layer, extending from 1500 feet (457 m) to 400 feet (122 m) and making landmark navigation difficult. As a result, the flight crew mistakenly identified Sunbury as Daylesford through a gap in the clouds, leading them to believe that they were 30 kilometres (19 miles) behind where they actually were on their flight plan. Had the flight crew cross-referenced their ground speed with previous landmarks, they would likely have realised that they were not where they thought they were. Instead, they overshot Essendon and, unable to see through the heavy fog, crashed into Mount Dandenong a few hundred metres from the summit. Exactly what happened in the last few minutes before the crash is disputed. There are claims that the pilots may have seen the mountain coming and tried to turn the aircraft away, inadvertently making the situation worse by adjusting from a flight path through a gap between two peaks to a path directly into one of them. There is also strong evidence that the pilots were becoming unsure of their position. According to Macarthur Jobs book, Disaster in the Dandenongs, the radio operator had requested the controller at Essendon give them a radio bearing. Essendon had acknowledged and told them to leave their transmitter on, but the signal stopped and no further contact was made. It is thought that this is the moment that Kyeema hit the mountain. Passengers and crew There were 18 people on board the DC-2: 14 passengers, the captain, the first officer, an air hostess, and a cadet pilot who operated the radio during the flight. Among the passengers was Australian Member of Parliament, Charles Hawker; three leading wine makers from South Australia, Hugo Gramp, Tom Hardy and Sidney Hill Smith; several barristers; and a young couple on their honeymoon. alt=Half portrait of stewardess in dark cap and uniform in front of nose and engines of piston-engined airliner, emblazoned with the name Kyeema Aftermath The memorial cairn just above the crash site.By public demand a Royal Commission into the cause of the disaster was established, and the Australian Federal Government appointed an Air Accident Investigation Committee under the Chairmanship of Colonel T. Murdoch DSO, VCE with the public enquiry commencing on 30 October 1938. Because of the crash, regulations were passed which require flight checking officers to monitor the flights of aeroplanes and advise on such things as position, weather, and alternate landing options. Also implementation of a 33 MHz radio range system was recommended to provide pilots with accurate information on their course. Eric Harrison (RAAF officer) was a member of the court of inquiry into the crash on 25 October of the Douglas DC-2 airliner Kyeema. The inquiry's report singled out Major Melville Langslow, Finance Member on both the Civil Aviation Board and the RAAF Air Board, for criticism over cost-cutting measures that had held up trials of safety beacons designed for such eventualities. According to Air Force historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, when Langslow was appointed Secretary at the Department of Air in November the following year, he went out of his way to \\"make life difficult\\" for Harrison, causing \\"bitterness and friction within the department\\", and necessitating the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Stanley Goble, to take steps to shield the safety inspector from the new Secretary's ire.[Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp.312‚Äì314] It was not until 40 years after the crash that a memorial to the Kyeema and its eighteen passengers was created at the crash site.

In 1939, he joined Happy Wilson's Golden River Boys, a country swing group, and acquired his nickname when a van trunk lid fell on him before a show and he never flinched.Matthew Loukes, Obituary, \\"The Guardian\\", 28 March 2013.

Spelling variations of Buckley include Bucklie, Buckly, Bulkley, Buhilly, √ì Buachalla, Boughla and others. England This branch of the Buckley family is credited by some unknown sources as being of Anglo-Saxon origin, either as a habitation surname derived from settlements named Buckley, or as an occupational surname from the Anglo-Saxon words Bucc and Leah, meaning goat and wood. The surname Buckley is the 435th most common name in the United Kingdom,BUCKLEY, sofeminine.co.uk. URL accessed February 15, 2007. or 234th in England and Wales. It is particularly common in Surrey, but also Cheshire, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire amongst other places. Rochdale A branch of the Buckley family lived in Buckley, Greater Manchester in Rochdale for many centuries.Rochdale Families - Buckley , rochdale.gov.uk. URL accessed February 15, 2007. They gave their name to Buckley Hall a manorhouse found within the locality. Their name is said to derive from \\"bleak hill\\" and they can be traced back to a \\"Geoffrey de Buckley\\". Ireland √ì Buachalla, taken from the Irish word 'buachaill' originally meaning 'herdsman' (in modern Irish it has come to mean 'boy'), was anglicised early as √ì Boughelly, Boughla, Buhilly and later as Buckley. The name Buckley in Ireland is derived from the native Gaelic √ì Buachalla Sept that was located in Lemanaghan (Liath Manch√°in), Co Offaly, where an important monastery was situated. The √ì Buachalla's claimed to be descendants of the cowherd of St. Manch√°n or Manahan and hereditary bearers of his shrine, the custodians of which were the O'Moonys of Doon, County Offaly. The last reference to the site as a monastery comes in 1205 when the death of the coarb (a type of administrator), Gillebrenyn O‚Äô Bichollye (Buckley), is recorded. There was also a sept in northeast County Cork at the same time. Both were dispersed by the Cambro- Normans. Patrick Woulfe in his 'Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall' ('Irish Names and Surnames' 1923), says that in the 16th century Buckley was peculiar to Cork, Tipperary, Offaly and especially Kerry. The area surrounding Lemanaghan in Offaly is still home to many Buckleys today. The name still also exists as Buhilly and Boughla in Offaly today. This name was brought to Ulster in the seventeenth Century by settlers. Buckley is the 99th most numerous name in Ireland. Notable Buckleys * A. J.

Hawkenbury is a small village area located in the south east of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. History Hawkenbury was settled before Tunbridge Wells itself was founded in the 17th century, and at one time fell within the parish of Frant, lying as it then did in Sussex. It was originally known as \\"Hockenbury\\". Bacon's 1912 map of Tunbridge Wells shows the centre of Hawkenbury lying along Hawkenbury Road, being that area currently lying south of the recreation ground. The Victorian estate around Sibby's Corner was not then considered part of Hawkenbury. Hawkenbury had no less than four places of worship, being a Congregationalist chapel (now United Reformed Church) at Sibby's Corner, a St. Peter's Mission on the junction of Forest Road and Napier Road, an unnamed church on Hawkenbury Road (below the present site of Hawkenbury Mews) and a second Congregationalist chapel lay below the present site of the Hawkenbury Road allotments, as did a number of village dwellings. Beyond agriculture, the residents were employed in the Brickfields, lying due east of present-day Maryland Road. South of Brickfields were a plethora of now-vanished farm buildings, the remains of which can still be traced from the footpath off Chieveley Drive. In 1912 Halls Hole Road was called Marlpits Lane and Whybourne Gate Farm lay on the site of the current Whybourne Crest. Governance Hawkenbury is located within the Park ward of Tunbridge Wells, and elects three councillors to Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. Hawkenbury is not part of a parish council (the Borough Council acts as the Parish). Hawkenbury falls under the Tunbridge Wells South district at county level. Hawkenbury is part of the constituency of Tunbridge Wells at a national level, and South East England at a European level. Transport The closest railway station is Tunbridge Wells. Buses serve Hawkenbury from Monday to Saturday, and are provided by Nu-Venture. Parks and open spaces Farmcombe Road Open Space is a small open green area. Camden Park contains a pastoral area, known as The Meadow, in the middle of an estate developed by Lord Camden in the mid-19th century. The Hawkenbury Recreation Ground is a large public space that has cricket and football pitches, tennis courts, an all-weather pitch and a children's play area. There are also allotments in Hawkenbury, in Halls Hole Road, managed by the Hawkenbury Allotment Holders' Association.

This is in contrast to the full disk encryption where the entire partition or disk, in which the file system resides, is encrypted. Types of filesystem-level encryption include: * the use of a 'stackable' cryptographic filesystem layered on top of the main file system * a single general-purpose file system with encryption The advantages of filesystem-level encryption include: * flexible file-based key management, so that each file can be and usually is encrypted with a separate encryption key * individual management of encrypted files e.g. incremental backups of the individual changed files even in encrypted form, rather than backup of the entire encrypted volume * access control can be enforced through the use of public-key cryptography, and * the fact that cryptographic keys are only held in memory while the file that is decrypted by them is held open. General-purpose file systems with encryption Unlike cryptographic file systems or full disk encryption, general-purpose file systems that include filesystem-level encryption do not typically encrypt file system metadata, such as the directory structure, file names, sizes or modification timestamps. This can be problematic if the metadata itself needs to be kept confidential. In other words, if files are stored with identifying file names, anyone who has access to the physical disk can know which documents are stored on the disk, although not the contents of the documents. One exception to this is the encryption support being added to the ZFS filesystem. Filesystem metadata such as filenames, ownership, ACLs, extended attributes are all stored encrypted on disk. The ZFS metadata relating to the storage pool is stored in plaintext, so it is possible to determine how many filesystems (datasets) are available in the pool, including which ones are encrypted. The content of the stored files and directories remain encrypted. Another exception is CryFS replacement for EncFS. Cryptographic file systems Cryptographic file systems are specialized (not general-purpose) file systems that are specifically designed with encryption and security in mind. They usually encrypt all the data they contain ‚Äì including metadata. Instead of implementing an on-disk format and their own block allocation, these file systems are often layered on top of existing file systems e.g. residing in a directory on a host file system. Many such file systems also offer advanced features, such as deniable encryption, cryptographically secure read-only file system permissions and different views of the directory structure depending on the key or user ... One use for a cryptographic file system is when part of an existing file system is synchronized with 'cloud storage'. In such cases the cryptographic file system could be 'stacked' on top, to help protect data confidentiality.

Measurements are plotted as a function of time in UTC. Langley extrapolation is a method for determining the Sun's irradiance at the top of the atmosphere with ground-based instrumentation, and is often used to remove the effect of the atmosphere from measurements of, for example, aerosol optical thickness or ozone. It is based on repeated measurements with a sun photometer operated at a given location for a cloudless morning or afternoon as the Sun moves across the sky. It is named for American astronomer and physicist Samuel Pierpont Langley. Theory It is known from Beer's law that, for every instantaneous measurement, the direct-Sun irradiance I is linked to the solar extraterrestrial irradiance I0 and the atmospheric optical depth \\\\tau by the following equation: where m is a geometrical factor accounting for the slant path through the atmosphere, known as the airmass factor. For a plane-parallel atmosphere, the airmass factor is simple to determine if one knows the solar zenith angle Œ∏: m = 1/cos(Œ∏). As time passes, the Sun moves across the sky, and therefore Œ∏ and m vary according to known astronomical laws. Direct solar radiation as a function of secant of solar zenith angle at Niamey, Niger. December 24, 2006. From ARM data, from an MFRSR instrument. Wavelength in units of nanometers is indicated. Log is base 10. By taking the logarithm of the above equation, one obtains: and if one assumes that the atmospheric disturbance \\\\tau does not change during the observations (which last for a morning or an afternoon), the plot of ln I versus m is a straight line with a slope equal to \\\\tau. Then, by linear extrapolation to m = 0, one obtains I0, i.e. the Sun's radiance that would be observed by an instrument placed above the atmosphere. Points are Langley extrapolation to top of atmosphere of direct solar radiation measured at Niamey, Niger 24 December 2006. Compared with Planck functions with the wavelength in micrometers. The requirement for good Langley plots is a constant atmosphere (constant \\\\tau). This requirement can be fulfilled only under particular conditions, since the atmosphere is continuously changing. Needed conditions are in particular: the absence of clouds along the optical path, and the absence of variations in the atmospheric aerosol layer. Since aerosols tend to be more concentrated at low altitude, Langley extrapolation is often performed at high mountain sites. Data from NASA Glenn Research Center indicates that the Langley plot accuracy is improved if the data is taken above the tropopause. Solar cell calibration A Langley plot can also be used as a method to calculate the performance of solar cells outside the Earth's atmosphere. At the Glenn Research Center, the performance of solar cells is measured as a function of altitude. By extrapolation, researchers determine their performance under space conditions.Solar Cell Measurement and Calibration . NASA Low cost LED-based photometers Sun photometers using low cost light-emitting diode (LED) detectors in place of optical interference filters and photodiodes have a relatively wide spectral response. They might be used by a globally distributed network of students and teachers to monitor atmospheric haze and aerosols, and can be calibrated using Langley extrapolation.Brooks, David R., and Forrest M.

The manual suggests that once a photometer is constructed, the user waits for a clear day with few clouds, no haze and constant humidity.The manual also states that the Langley plot could be done under a uniform cloud cover, albeit with less precision After the data is fit to equation () to find I0, the handbook suggests a daily measurement of I. Both I0 and I are obtained from the LED current (voltage across sensing resistor) by subtracting the dark current: where V_s is the voltage while the LED is pointing at the Sun, and V_d is the voltage while the LED is kept dark. There is a misprint in the manual regarding the calculation of \\\\tau from this single data point. The correct equation is:Note that log A ‚Äì log B =ln A - ln B.

The gymnast and her family filed a lawsuit against the owners of World Olympic Gymnastics Academy alleging that they had failed to properly screen and supervise the coach. The suit does not seek a specific amount of money from the academy owners and doesn't accuse them of abuse. Bill Boyd, the gym's attorney, has said all instructors receive a criminal background check and the gym was not aware of any accusations until a police investigation in 2005, after Wagoner had left. Wagoner was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida and received a 15 year prison sentence after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting the gymnast.

The main difference is in the musical/thematic content of each style. Where UK hard house has uplifting, playfully fun and tough elements, NRG is ominous, dark, aggressive and relentless with its distressed, menacing and gritty sounds on a slightly faster BPM (155‚Äì165 average) than UK hard house (150‚Äì155 average). In regard to the mechanics of the scene, many of the labels have made a shift from purely vinyl releases to CD single releases and digital downloads. Record labels which produce the genre include Vicious Circle, Flashpoint, Tidy Trax, Kaktai, Tonka Trax, Tinrib Digital, Noir Records and Noir Digital. History 1980s‚Äìearly 1990s : Roots in UK hard house & EU techno Acid house of the late 1980s was the 'happier' (playful/fun) side of dance music exemplified by Italian piano-house (Italo disco/Hi-NRG of the early 90s) and this began to progress into a scene of its own. Throughout the first half of the 90s, house music which was more akin to the soulful, disco influenced dance music of the 80s, continued to flourish. By the mid 90s, uplifting house music in this vein was in abundance and producers in the UK such as The Sharp Boys were providing their own interpretation of the sound. They upped the BPMs a little, chopped up the disco samples into bite size loops, chucked a load of filters in and created music that was pure dance floor business. This was the sound that provided the basis for the origins of UK hard house. At the time, it was exclusive to the gay scene in the UK and for a while known as \\"Hand Bag House\\" or \\"Hard Bag\\". Hard house as a style was epitomized in the early days by producers such as Paul Janes, The Tidy Boys, Pete Wardman, Steve Thomas, Ian M, Alan Thompson, Captain Tinrib, DJ Ziad & Tony De Vit. Some of the above- mentioned names were heavily involved in the club night 'Trade', which is widely regarded as the home and birthplace of UK hard house with Tony De Vit as the 'godfather' of UK hard house. In the early 1990s, producers like Joey Beltram had transposed the sound of U.S. techno to Belgium, and added their own twist to it. This new brand of techno was darker, harder, and generally nastier than anything that had preceded it. The techno that had emerged from Detroit in the US had the seemingly paradoxical quality of somehow being soulful while at the same time being 100% electronic. The Belgian techno sound ripped out this soul, and replaced it with something altogether more sinister. It was this style of music that gave birth to the sound of the \\"Hoover\\", a gritty sound produced by the Roland Alpha Juno 2 synthesizer and so called because of its apparent similarity to the noises made by vacuum cleaners.  Late 1990s‚Äì2000s: From nu-NRG to Hard NRG  By 1996‚Äì97, there was a steady flow of UK based hard house that threw away the fun & uplifting parts to incorporate the \\"Hoover\\" & other gritty, menacing sounding elements at a slightly higher tempo than the conventional hard house and thus, the style effectively became known as \\"Nu-NRG\\" when Blu Peter coined the phrase in a magazine interview. Doug Osbourne (Sourmash/Razor's Edge/Illuminatae), Gordon Matthewman (DJ Edge/Illuminatae), Jon Bell (Captain Tinrib), Jon Vaughan (Jon The Dentist), John Truelove (Lectrolux/Hyperspace) Pete Davis (Baby Doc/Hyperspace), Owen Swinard & Dom Sweeten (OD404), Paul King, John Newell (RR Fierce), Ben Keen (BK) and Nick Sentience all had a heavy hand in shaping this sound in the UK specifically. Outside the UK, producers such as DJ Misjah (Dyewitness), Ramon Zenker (E-Trax/Phenomania/Exit EEE), Yoji Biomehanika, Commander Tom, Nuclear Hyde etc., all dabbled with the sound from time to time. The late 1990s & early 2000s saw NRG expand a little further when the sound became even fiercer, darker and much more serious than Nu-NRG. DJ Kristian then coined the phrase \\"Hard NRG\\" while Jon Bell (Captain Tinrib/Dr. Base/Fierce Base), John Newell (RR Fierce/Rim 'N Chop/Fierce Base), Karim Lamouri (Karim/Rim 'N Chop) Chris Payne (Casper) & Barmak Hatamian (The Alien Thing/Max & Amino) were instrumental in the development of Hard NRG. 2010s‚Äìpresent At present, Nu-NRG & Hard NRG is known simply as NRG throughout the scene since it has become extremely difficult to draw a line of distinction between the two styles. There is however, a monumental difference between UK hard house and NRG.

Argentium alloys replace some of the copper in the traditional sterling silver alloy (92.5% silver + 7.5% copper) with the metalloid germanium.Peter Johns (1997) Firestain Resistant Silver Alloys. Santa Fe Symposium On Jewellery Manufacturing Technology. Argentium's patents refer to percentages of zinc and boron present in Argentium silver. Both Argentium alloys exceed the standard required for hallmarking as sterling silver and Argentium silver 960 meets the standard for hallmarking as Britannia silver (95.84% silver). Origins and description Argentium silver is the result of research by Peter Johns at the Art and Design Research Institute (ADRI), School of Art & Design, Middlesex University. The project began in 1990 with research on the effects of germanium additions to silver alloys. Germanium was discovered to impart the following properties to sterling silver:Johns, Peter and Davis, Sam (2007) The properties and applications of Argentium (TM) Sterling Silver. In: 31st IPMI Conference (International Precious Metals Institute) * Firescale elimination * High tarnish resistance * Precipitation hardening and simple heat-hardening properties * Increased ductility * Increased thermal and electrical resistance (making alloys suitable for welding and laser forming) * Environmental advantages (associated with not having to remove or plate over firescale) Many of these properties significantly affect the traditional methods of working silver. For instance the absence of firescale eliminates tedious and time- consuming steps required by the silver worker using traditional sterling silver. It also eliminates the need for plating the final product which is often done on manufactured items because of the problems introduced by firescale. Tarnish resistance is of significant importance to both silver workers and the wearer of silver jewellery. Argentium Silver is patented and trademarked by Argentium Silver Company, UK. Physical properties Traditional sterling silver has a solidus melting temperature of 802¬∞C (1475¬∞F) and a liquidus flow point of 899¬∞C (1650¬∞F). Argentium 935 silver has a solidus of 803¬∞C (1477¬∞F) and a liquidus of 903¬∞C (1657¬∞F), while Argentium 960 has a solidus of 905¬∞C (1661¬∞F) and a liquidus of 925¬∞C (1697¬∞F).

The aircraft was built by the State Aircraft Factory (Valtion lentokonetehdas) (abbreviated either V.L. or VL) and was a two-seat, biplane, single-engine trainer constructed out of wood. The aircraft was designed by Kurt Berger and Asser J√§rvinen in 1927 and the prototype was financed by the ten-person construction team that built the aircraft in the A.E. Nyman workshop. The prototype was called S√§√§ski I and was completed in the early spring of 1928. The aircraft's civil registration code was \\"K-SASA\\" and it was sold to the Finnish Air Force on June 25, 1928. The constructors of the aircraft formed a company called S√§√§ski in 1928, obtained the manufacturing license from the designers, and had four improved S√§√§ski II's built by the State Aircraft Company for civilian use. When a lack of orders threatened to drive the company to bankruptcy, the FAF ordered 10 S√§√§ski II aircraft. These were built in 1930. Two further series were ordered by the air force and the total production of the aircraft numbered 32 aircraft between 1930 and 1932. The second series (beginning with S√Ñ-127) differed from the first in having a greater span. This version was called S√§√§ski IIA. The aircraft was considered to be safe and reliable and was also equipped with floats. The seaplane version was still able to do aerobatics. Use in Finland The Finnish Air Force operated 33 S√§√§ski aircraft between 1928-1943: the 32 production aircraft bore the identification codes S√Ñ-113, S√Ñ-117 - S√Ñ-126 (version II), and S√Ñ-127 - S√Ñ-148 (version IIA), while the prototype, formerly known under the civil registration code K-SASA, was given the identification code S√Ñ-95 (version I). There were a further five S√§√§ski 's in the civilian register. The aircraft was primarily used as a trainer but also for aerial photography, aerial gunnery practice, and as a liaison aircraft for the army. One S√§√§ski IIA is preserved today and is on display at the Finnish Aviation Museum in Vantaa. Another one, the former coast guard aircraft LK 1, is on display at Maritime Centre Vellamo in Kotka, Finland.

It was recognised only by the German Empire and the South African Republic. Its independence was proclaimed on August 16, 1884, with land donated by the Zulu Kingdom through a treaty. It covered and the capital was Vryheid or Vrijheid (\\"Freedom\\" in Afrikaans or Dutch, respectively), both being alternative names of the state. The founder and president until it requested incorporation by Transvaal Republic on 20 July 1888 was Lucas Johannes Meyer, while Daniel Johannes Esselen acted as Secretary of State during the same period.  History  After Boer farmers, who lived in the area, helped Dinuzulu defeat his rival Zibhebhu for succession of the Zulu throne, land was given to them by way of session by the new Zulu king along the banks of the Mfolozi River. On August 5, 1884, the Boers formed the Nieuwe Republiek (New Republic) with recognition by Germany, ZAR and Portugal with Vryheid as its capital. The Nieuwe Republiek was finally recognized by the British on October 22, 1886 but within a few months the British annexed a stretch of the coastline of the Niewe Republic and the Zulu Kingdom north of the river Thukela river (1887) in order to prevent the new Boer republic from having access to the sea, which they needed for a harbor. British annexation of the Zulu territory resulted in a revolt, led by Dinuzulu (June 1888), who was defeated by the British. King Dinuzulu was tried for high treason in Eshowe and sentenced. The annexation of Zululand did not leave much hope for security in the Nieuwe Republiek against British imperialism. On July 20, 1888, the New Republic was incorporated with the Transvaal Republic on its own request, although enjoying considerable autonomy. The relations between the Boers and the Zulu remained stable until the outbreak of the Second Boer War (1899-1902). In June 1900 the British forces entered Vryheid, the capital. AJ Shepstone, son of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, the former secretary of native affairs in Natal, was sent to the area and worked together with the official British military intelligence J. Roberts to conspire with some Zulus against the Boers, and had victory achieved over the Boers in Schurweberg, near Vryheid. In March 1901 he declared martial law in the region. After the Second Boer War the territory was transferred to the British Colony of Natal (1903).

However, it took almost 40 years before the first American Football game played in the Netherlands was followed up. In 1946 two American University teams played an exhibition game in the Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam). Not until 1980 did the following step appear, when Ren√© Koningsferander issued a request on the TV sports programme 'Sprekershoek' for people who were interested in doing something with American Football in the Netherlands. Koningferander had been introduced to the sport by his gymnastics teacher Guus Annokkee who would go on to be the founder and inaugural chairman of the NAFF (Nederlandse American Football Federatie). Koningferander's TV plea instigated the founding of the Netherlands' first domestic club: the Amsterdam Rams. 1981 - 1984: Growth of interest The first game played by a Dutch American Football team was on Easter Sunday in 1981 when the Amsterdam Rams faced the Herne Tigers from Germany. A lack of any Dutch opponents forced the Rams to compete in the German Oberliga in the 1983 and 1984 season. This successful German adventure led the Rams to a 1984 victory in the Oberliga West Division. Meanwhile, initiatives were springing up all over the Netherlands via exhibition games and the broadcasting of college football by the fledgling SkyChannel. From these flames a number of Dutch clubs emerged including The Hague Raiders, Delft Dragons, Rotterdam Trojans, Zwolle Bulldogs, Alphen Eagles and Utrecht Vikings. Toward the end of 1984 a number of players from the Amsterdam Rams broke off to form a second team from the nation's capital city: the Amsterdam Crusaders. The Rams returned to the Netherlands and, along with the new teams, formed the Nederlandse American Football Federatie (NAFF). 1985 - 1989: Dutch competition The first Dutch American Football season took place in 1985. Eight teams in a single division would compete against each other for a place in the Dutch championship game initially called the \\"Super Bowl\\". The first championship game saw the Amsterdam Rams face their former team-mates the Amsterdam Crusaders. The Rams won the only Super Bowl - from 1986 the championship game was renamed the Tulip Bowl. Many factors combined to produce an explosive growth in this new sport which had been imported from the United States. The number of teams grew from 8 in 1985 to around 40 by the end of the 1980s. In addition, the teams from larger cities were able to professionalise further by obtaining large sponsors, attracted by the freshness of the sport and the considerable media attention both in the TV and press, which enabled them to hire American players and coaches. In 1986 the Netherlands organised Eurobowl I - the final of the European championship for national champions. The Amsterdam Rams achieved a respectable 3rd place in the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, with the Finnish Taft Vantaa claiming 1st place. 1987 saw the NAFF run a full Dutch competition with no less than 3 divisions. This season also saw the debut of Dutch officiating crews, supported by officials from the US airbase in Soesterberg. Early Nineties: Dutch Dynasty? The early 1990s saw the growth of American Football in the Netherlands settle down. The obvious next step was to look to the future. Youth teams and a youth competition were formed, and flag teams for the youngest participants. The top division of senior competition saw an enormous increase of quality, aided by the import of US players and coaches. By this time the Dutch competition was considered one of the strongest in the whole of Europe. In 1993, two Dutch teams made it to the semi-finals of the Eurobowl: The Amsterdam Crusaders and The Hague Raiders. The Amsterdam Crusaders (who had dominated the NAFF competition between 1987 and 1991) showed their class at European level by reaching 5 Eurobowl finals and winning the European championship in 1991 and 1992, sparking talk of a \\"Dutch dynasty\\". The Dutch National team, the Dutch Lions, won the bronze medal in the European Championships in Helsinki, Finland, in 1991. Head coach at the time was coach John Ralston. Late Nineties: Challenging Times The mid-nineties saw the growth of the sport stagnate in the Netherlands, bringing about the demise of several clubs. The novelty of the sport wore off and it was evident in the diminishing interest of sponsors. Television exposure was no longer to be taken for granted and the growth of the youth competition was suffering. Conversely the sport was undergoing a renaissance in the rest of Europe, with media interest and crowds growing. This situation forced the decision by the Amsterdam Crusaders to pull out of the Dutch competition and instead compete in the ill-fated Football League of Europe in 1994 and 1995 While the sport was struggling in the Netherlands, bigger thing were afoot for American Football on a global scale. 1991 saw the birth of the World League of American Football (WLAF). This precursor to NFL Europa was a professional competition founded and funded by the US league: the NFL. The intentions of the WLAF were two-fold: to increase the popularity of the sport in Europe and to act as a feeder league to the NFL, testing out young players who were on the brink of breaking into the NFL. These developments had a large influence on Dutch American Football. By the end of the 1990s American Football as a sport in the Netherlands was in crisis. Only a third of teams had survived, no sponsors were involved in the sport, and the level had suffered as a result. At the same time, the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europa were pulling in crowds of 12,000 for home games - many of them spectators who ten years earlier would have been supporting the teams in the Dutch competitions.

The character first appeared in Captain Marvel Adventures #78 in November 1947. Along with other members of Captain Marvel's rogues' gallery, Mister Atom was recruited by Mister Mind to be part of the second Monster Society of Evil in 1973. Publication history Mister Atom first appeared in Captain Marvel Adventures #78 and was created by Otto Binder and C. C. Beck. Fictional character biography  Golden Age and pre-Crisis version  Mister Atom was created by Dr. Charles Langley in a story in Captain Marvel Adventures #78. His body was constructed first, and then Langley charged the robot with radioactive energy. The spark that gave the robot life also ended the life of his creator. Super-charged with a nuclear reactor and armed with a deadly mind, Mister Atom went on a wave of destruction believing he should rule the world and killed several people in Washington, before being challenged to a fight to the finish by Captain Marvel as he tried to attack the UN Building. He was stopped (barely) by Captain Marvel. Mr. Atom was imprisoned in an underground, lead-lined cell, as no other prison could contain his power, but he threatens to break out one day.Captain Marvel Adventures #78. Fawcett Comics. Later he was freed by aliens called the Comet Men who hoped to employ his power in the conquest of Earth, though they told him he would rule Earth, and told him to destroy Fawcett City to show his power. But they fell to fighting among themselves when Mr Atom realized they planned to destroy him and they were all apparently destroyed in a giant explosion.Captain Marvel Adventures #81. Fawcett Comics. However, the blast had actually thrown Mr. Atom forward in time, to 2053, a world where almost everything was run by atomic power, which Mr Atom found out from an inhabitant, and he decided it would be the perfect conquest for him. Captain Marvel travelled to this future after being told by Shazam of the danger which threatened it and battled Atom again, who forced Marvel off by threatening to cause the destruction of the world using the machinery. By now the world officials had decided to give in to Mr Atom and sent a delegation. But once again he was apparently destroyed, this time in an atomic furnace when the engines were turned on after Marvel disguised himself as part of the delegation to block Mister Atom from the machinery.Captain Marvel Adventures #90. Fawcett Comics. However, Mister Atom was re-introduced in 1976, by which time DC Comics had purchased the rights to use the Captain Marvel characters; Captain Marvel's enemy King Kull used his advanced scientific acumen to bring Atom back to the 20th century and employed his help battling Shazam's Squadron of Justice. Atom's first appearance in a DC comic was in Justice League of America #137, a crossover issue depicting Captain Marvel's first meeting with Superman. With Brainiac projecting a force field around him a much larger Mr Atom attempts to wreck a futuristic city on Earth-One called Tomorrow. Destroying the city meant the three super-speedsters had to repair it, which was causing increased rotation of the Earth. Atom easily withstood the efforts of the Golden and Silver Age Green Lanterns and Flashes, the god Mercury and Ibis the Invincible to subdue him, even when Brainiac's forcefield around him was turned off and Brainiac had been defeated, but when he tried to use Ibis's Ibistick to send Ibis to a faraway star, having stunned Ibis from an energy blast, he found the stick had a failsafe that caused any commands that would harm Ibis to backfire on the user, and Atom was the one propelled far into space.Justice League of America #137. DC Comics. Again Atom was brought back to Earth, this time by Mister Mind, who employed him to attach his head to an atomic racecar and challenge Captain Marvel to an auto race in Indianapolis with the threat that he'd level the city with an atomic blast. When Captain Marvel won the race using a Shazam lightning-powered car, and destroyed Atom's car, Atom re-attached his head to his body and attacked Marvel, who hit him hard enough to achieve escape velocity and send Mister Atom into orbit around the sun. Mr Mind was meanwhile captured by Uncle Marvel using a Geiger counter.Shazam! #33. DC Comics. Captain Marvel then threw the racer into the Sun. Again Mister Mind retrieved Atom with help from the Evil God of Magic Oggar and enlisted him as a member of his Monster Society of Evil. During the Society's assault on the Rock of Eternity, Mr. Atom was shoved off the rock into another universe where life never developed, and he could do no harm.World's Finest #264-267. DC Comics.  Post-Crisis version  Two decades later, Atom was revamped by Jerry Ordway and re-introduced in The Power of Shazam! #23, Mister Atom's modern origin was roughly the same as his Golden Age origin. His appearance was modified, however: the humanoid cyborg design of the original gave way to a more mechanical giant robot look. In his new origin story, Atom, at first not a villain, was told by Dr. Langley before he died to find a suitable woman to take care of him. Mister Atom interpreted Mary Marvel as a suitable woman and kidnapped her, until Captain Marvel found Dr. Langley's assistant to watch over the robot.Power of Shazam! #23. DC Comics. In Power of Shazam! #27, Mister Atom was controlled by Mister Mind into creating a nuclear explosion that destroyed the city of Fairview, home to the Marvels, killing thousands.Power of Shazam! #27. DC Comics. In \\"Infinite Crisis,\\" Mister Atom became a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains, but was seemingly destroyed by the Golden Age Superman, Kal-L. He didn't stay down for long. In 52,\\" Captain Marvel mentioned that Mister Atom attacked the Rock of Eternity, only to fail. It is later revealed that Mister Atom is one of the villains who helped Prometheus plant explosive devices in various cities across the U.S., which leads to Mister Atom and several other villains making an attempt to flee the country. Before they can cross the border, the group is attacked by the Justice League, and Mister Atom is defeated and captured by Starman and Congorilla.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #43. DC Comics. In \\"DC Rebirth,\\" Mister Atom came from the Gamelands and is a member of the Monster Society of Evil. He was among its members imprisoned in the Dungeon of Eternity within the Monsterlands until Mister Mind instructed Doctor Sivana on how to free them.Shazam! Vol. 3 #11. DC Comics. As Shazam fights a Mister Mind-possessed C.C. Batson, Pedro ends in a strength battle with Mister Atom where he states to Pedro that he'll win this game. When Pedro asks what game he's talking about, Mister Atom calls it \\"Man vs. Machine.\\" While still pinning Pedro down, Mister Atom watches the skies when Mister Mind has Shazam read the spell from the Book of Champions that unites the Seven Magiclands.Shazam! Vol. 3 #13. DC Comics. When Shazam defeats Mister Mind, the resulting magical energy knocked out Mister Atom and the rest of the Monster Society of Evil. The Monster Society of Evil was mentioned to have been remanded to Rock Falls Penitentiary where the Shazam Family built a special section to contain magical threats.Shazam! Vol. 3 #14. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Mister Atom has upper level superhuman strength and endurance. His robot body is virtually impervious to harm. Mister Atom can fly and fire nuclear blasts from his hands (In the Golden Age, at least, lead is impervious to these blasts). Other versions Mister Atom appeared in an issue of the Justice League Unlimited comic book, where Doctor Sivana was trying to rebuild him with the help of a local gang. Atom and Sivana were eventually defeated by the Justice League, particularly Vibe. The character also appeared several times in the all-ages comic series Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!

Thornton-Smith was replaced by Jamie Roberts in 2007. Kerfuffle disbanded in August 2010. History Kerfuffle formed initially as a three- piece after Sam and Tom Sweeney met Hannah James. James was competing in a traditional music competition, the In The Tradition Award, held at the Derby Assembly Rooms. Sam had previously won this, and was attending the 2001 competition in this capacity. After playing together in the foyer, the trio decided to form a band. After going on to win the under-18 category of the 2002 Wiltshire Folk Association Young Folk Award, another competition that Sam had previously won as a soloist, the band sought a fourth member and Hannah introduced the band to guitarist Chris Thornton-Smith. Having won the WFA competition, the band was given a showcase performance at the 2002 Trowbridge Village Pump Festival. After a number of appearances at folk clubs, Kerfuffle recorded their first album in the spring of 2003. Produced by multi- instrumentalist Steafan Hannigan and recorded at his Ois√≠n Studios, Not to Scale was released on the newly founded RootBeat Records on 14 June 2003, to coincide with the band's appearance at the first Festival of the Peak, a festival held at Carsington Water in Derbyshire. In the summer of 2003, Kerfuffle appeared at a number of other UK folk/traditional festivals, including Sidmouth Festival and a return to Trowbridge Village Pump Festival. For 2004's K2, the band decided to utilise the sound engineering skills of guitarist Chris Thornton-Smith, and the album was recorded by Chris. The album was released in time for the band's summer festival appearances, which included Cleckheaton Festival, Priddy Folk Fayre, Stainsby Festival, Saltburn Festival, Whitby Folk Week, Towersey Festival, Bromyard Festival and a slot at the Show of Hands summer concert in the Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens. In December 2004, the band were finalists in the 2004/5 BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Awards. Summer 2005 saw the band appear at Cleethorpes Folk Festival, Middlewich Folk & Boat Festival, Priddy Folk Festival, and Saddleworth Folk Festival. Also in 2005, the band's performances began to diversify into venues such as theatres and arts centres, as well as folk clubs, most notably including a performance as the post-show entertainment at the Linbury Theatre, a studio theatre attached to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. The same year, Kerfuffle recorded a live session for BBC Radio 3's Late Junction. In early 2006, the band released Links. Appearances that summer at Bromyard Folk Festival, Brampton Live, Festival at the Edge and other events followed. A track from Links was included on the compilation Folk Rising released in July 2007. In late 2007, having had a successful summer including appearances at Fairport's Cropredy Convention, Derby Traditional Music and Arts Festival and Shrewsbury Folk Festival, the band announced they would start work on their fourth album, their first featuring new guitarist Jamie Roberts (of folk duo Gilmore & Roberts), who had replaced Chris Thornton-Smith earlier that year. The album, entitled To The Ground, was released in 2008. 2007 also saw Sweeney join 11-piece folk band Bellowhead, having already played some gigs as a deputy for Giles Lewin. In April 2010, Kerfuffle announced that after nine years Kerfuffle, in the current line-up, would come to an end. That summer included \\"farewell\\" visits to festivals including Sidmouth and Priddy. Their final performance was at Shrewsbury Folk Festival in August 2010. In December 2010, Sam Sweeney, James and Roberts toured performing material from Lighten The Dark: A Midwinter Album. Tom Sweeney was replaced by special guest Rob Harbron. They were supported by Hannah James' band Lady Maisery, and the set included clog dancing. In winter 2012, Kerfuffle reformed for a short UK Christmas-focussed tour, including once again Lighten the Dark material, and several clog-dancing episodes by Hannah.

Msiri (c. 1830 ‚Äì December 20, 1891) founded and ruled the Yeke Kingdom (also called the Garanganze or Garenganze kingdom) in south-east Katanga (now in DR Congo) from about 1856 to 1891. His name is sometimes spelled 'M'Siri' in articles in French. Other variants are \\"Mziri\\", \\"Msidi\\", and \\"Mushidi\\"; and his full name was Mwenda Msiri Ngelengwa Shitambi.Mwami Msiri, King of Garanganze. Retrieved 8 February 2007. Msiri's origins and rise to power Southern Central Africa in 1890 showing the central position of Msiri's Yeke Kingdom and the principal trade routes, with the approximate territories of Msiri's main allies (names in yellow) and the approximate areas occupied by European powers (names in orange ‚Äî does not show spheres of influence or borders). The east coast trade was controlled by the Sultan of Zanzibar. Areas of influence of other tribes and of France and Germany are not shown. From Tabora to Katanga Msiri was a Nyamwezi (also known as \\"Yeke\\" or \\"Bayeke\\") from Tabora in modern-day Tanzania and a trader, like his father Kalasa, involved in the copper, ivory and East African slave trade controlled by the Sultan of Zanzibar and his Arab and Swahili agents. The main trade route went to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika and then to Lake Mweru and Katanga.Moloney, Joseph Augustus (1893). With Captain Stairs to Katanga, pp. 172‚àí3, London: Sampson Low, Marston & Company (). Military power Msiri realised access to guns was the key to power, and in Katanga, he had copper and ivory resources to trade for them. He formed a militia and started to conquer his neighbours. He also married into the Luba royal family, starting his practice of using wives as spies.The Story of Africa: The East African Slave Trade. British Broadcasting Corporation (World Service).

He depended on the east coast trade for his guns and gunpowder, which passed through the territory of his rivals, making supplies expensive and unreliable. Instead he turned to the west coast, sending his nephew Molenga to the Ovimbundu and Portuguese traders around Benguela in Angola, and a trader there called Coimbra became his supplier. The Luba people to his north-west had controlled the west coast trade, but Msiri took it over and halted their southwards expansion. Msiri now had the power and influence to form alliances as more of an equal with warlords such as Tippu Tip, who controlled the eastern Congo from Lake Tanganyika up to what is now Uganda in the north-east, and the Nyamwezi leader Mirambo who controlled the land route between Lake Tanganyika and the coast, and he sought to emulate them. Msiri achieved what other tribes and the Portuguese had tried without as much success, which was to trade across the continent, with both coasts. By the time of David Livingstone's visit to Mwata Kazembe VIII in 1867, Msiri had taken control of most of the Mwata's territory and trade on the west bank of the Luapula River. Tippu Tip wanted revenge on Kazembe for killing six of his men, and he formed an alliance with Msiri to attack and kill Mwata Kazembe in 1870,Livingstone, David and Waller, Horace (ed.). The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa from 1865 to his Death. Two Volumes. London: John Murray. and Msiri subsequently influenced the appointment of his successors. Msiri's control of south-east Katanga and its copper resources was consolidated.Gordon, David (2000). \\"Decentralized Despots or Contingent Chiefs: Comparing Colonial Chiefs in Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo\\". KwaZulu-Natal History and African Studies Seminar. Durban: University of Natal. Msiri's strategy Msiri's favourite wife, the Portuguese-Angolan Maria de Fonseca, who died a grisly death at the hand of Msiri's adopted son and successor. In a region and age dominated by armed traders, Msiri was very successful. His control of the trade routes between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans took ruthlessness and arms (and over his neighbours, Msiri had what would be called in the west ‚Äòsuperior military technology‚Äô). But it also took a strategic eye, and the guile and persuasion required to form alliances with hundreds of other tribes, rulers and traders. He did this through his wives, who numbered more than 500. He took a wife from the village of each subordinate chief, making the chief think this gave him an advocate at Msiri's court, but the wife was used to spy on the chief instead and to obtain information about his dealings and loyalty. The wife could also be used as a hostage in case of any rebellion by that chief. Msiri also cemented alliances with other powerful trading partners through marriage. His favourite wife was said to be Maria de Fonseca, sister of his Portuguese-Angolan trading partner Coimbra.Moloney 1893, pp. 174‚àí5. Msiri married one of his own daughters to Tippu Tip. In 1884, wishing to gain some advice on how to deal with the approaching European colonial powers, he invited a Scottish missionary, Frederick Stanley Arnot, who he had heard was in Angola, to come to his capital at Bunkeya, 180 km west of the Luapula River. In 1886 Arnot arrived and was the first white person to settle in Katanga. After three years he went back to Britain to recruit more missionaries, including Charles Swan and Dan Crawford.Keir Howard, J: \\"Arnot, Frederick Stanley\\", in Dictionary of African Christian Biography. Retrieved 9 February 2007. Thus, the first missionaries in Katanga did not decide to go there at their own initiative. Msiri's strategy worked: the missionaries' advice prevented him being taken in by the first British and Belgian expeditions (see below). It is also possible that Msiri had the idea to hold the missionaries hostage in case of any war with the Europeans, in the same way that he held hostage the women of subject tribes.Moloney 1893, p. 180.Stairs thought the missionaries were hostages, and said Msiri referred to them as his 'white slaves'. See letter of William Stairs Letter to Frederick Arnot, 29 December 1891, reproduced in: Arnot, R. S. (1958). \\"F S Arnot and Msidi\\", Northern Rhodesia Journal, III (5), 428‚àí434.

The scramble for Katanga and killing of Msiri British Expeditions (Sharpe and Thomson), 1890 Cecil Rhodes‚Äô British South Africa Company (BSAC) and Belgian King Leopold II‚Äôs Congo Free State (CFS) both wanted to sign treaties with Msiri to fulfil their colonial ambitions and competed to do so. Some of Msiri's subordinate chiefs and trading competitors took the opportunity of the arrival of new powers in the region to start rebellions against his authority. In November 1890 Alfred Sharpe arrived in Bunkeya from Nyasaland on behalf of the BSAC and the British Commissioner in Central Africa/Nyasaland, Sir Harry Johnston, with a mineral rights concession and a British protectorate treaty for signature. The explorer Joseph Thomson was sent by the BSAC to meet up with and reinforce Sharpe's mission in Bunkeya, but its route was blocked by a smallpox epidemic and it could not continue.Moloney 1893, Chapter I. Arnot was still in Britain but Charles Swan and Dan Crawford were present. Msiri and his officials could not read English and Sharpe described the agreement favourably, but Arnot had advised Msiri to have any treaties translated, and Swan now gave the same advice. For this the missionaries were later the subject of resentment and anger on behalf of the BSAC, because when the treaty's real contents were revealed to Msiri, enraged, he sent Sharpe away empty-handed. Sharpe was sure Msiri would not sign away his sovereignty to any other power, and he advised Johnston to wait until he was 'out of the way'. Belgian Expeditions (Le Marinel and Delcommune), 1891  On 18 April 1891 Leopold sent an expedition of about 350 men led by Paul Le Marinel. He obtained a brief letter signed by Msiri and witnessed by Swan (and probably drafted by him), that Msiri would accept CFS agents in his territory.\\"Le Capitaine Paul le Marinel & Alexandre Delcomune.\\" Les Expatries Lubumbashi. Retrieved 28 March 2007. This is an extract from a history of the Belgian mining company Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga, 1906‚àí1956. It did not mention agreeing to the CFS flag being hoisted nor to recognising Leopold's sovereignty, and its lack of precision was probably designed to keep Leopold at bay, so a few months later the Delcommune Expedition followed up to try to achieve those objectives, but again Msiri refused. Expecting that the BSAC would try again with Thomson, Leopold resolved to take stronger action with his third expedition of 1891.Moloney 1893, pp. 6‚àí9. The Stairs Expedition and the killing of Msiri On December 14, 1891 the armed Stairs Expedition of the CFS arrived in Bunkeya with 400 troops and porters, led by Canadian mercenary, Captain W. G. Stairs, ordered by Leopold to raise the CFS flag and claim Katanga by force if necessary.Moloney 1893, pp. 9‚àí12. Negotiations commenced and Msiri indicated he might agree to a treaty if supplied with gunpowder. According to the Stairs Expedition's doctor Joseph Moloney and third officer Christian de Bonchamps, with negotiations at stalemate, Msiri reacted to an ultimatum and to Stairs flying the CFS flag without his consent, by departing in the night to a fortified village at Munema on the outskirts of Bunkeya. The next day, 20 December 1891, Stairs sent his second-in-command, Belgian Lieutenant Omer Bodson with de Bonchamps and 100 askaris to arrest Msiri. Despite de Bonchamps' concerns about the danger, Bodson went into Munema with a dozen men and confronted Msiri in front of about 300 of his warriors. Msiri said nothing but in anger started to draw the sword which had been a gift from Stairs. Bodson drew his revolver and shot Msiri three times, killing him. A fight erupted, and Bodson was shot and mortally wounded by one of Msiri's men, dying later.Moloney 1893, Chapter XI pp. 182‚àí194.De Pont-Jest, Ren√© (1892). \\"L'Exp√©dition du Katanga, d'apr√®s les notes de voyage du marquis Christian de Bonchamps\\" .

This was a 19th-century travel magazine published and edited by Edouard Charton in Paris. The article includes extracts from the journal of de Bonchamps. The oral history of the Garanganze people contains some contradictions about the incident. In one story, Msiri speared Bodson to death and was shot by other members of the expedition.Fabian 1998. However, Dr Moloney confirmed that Bodson was killed by a musket ball not a spear, and de Bonchamps wrote that Bodson told him before he died that he had shot Msiri, and had then been shot. The fate of Msiri's head In an article published in Paris in 1892, de Bonchamps revealed that having carried Msiri's body back to their camp, the expedition cut off his head and hoisted it on a pole as a 'barbaric lesson' to the Garanganze. Moloney's book is silent on the subject. Dan Crawford was at a Belgian outpost 40 km away and, relying on a Garanganze report, he wrote that after shooting Msiri, 'Bodson' cut off his head and shouted \\"I have killed a tiger! Vive le Roi!\\".Tilsley, G. E. (1929). Dan Crawford: Missionary and Pioneer in Central Africa. London: Oliphants. Bodson had been shot in the abdomen and spine immediately after killing Msiri, so it was not he who decapitated Mziri. The Garanganze oral history mixes up the European officers in other places, sometimes confusing Stairs and Bodson for example. Garanganze oral history says that the body returned to them by Stairs for burial was headless, and that the expedition kept the head. One account says that it cursed and killed everyone who carried itFabian, Johannes (11 November 1998). \\"The history of Zaire as told and painted by Tshibumba Kanda Matulu in conversation with Johannes Fabian.\\" Archives of Popular Swahili 2 (2). . and eventually, this included Stairs himself, who died of malaria six months later on the return journey, and it was alleged he had with him Msiri's head in a can of kerosene. The history of Msiri's successors says that the head was buried under a hill of stones in Zambia, but it also says Msiri's successor 'caught and killed all the Europeans on the expedition'.Mwami Msiri, King of Garanganze . Retrieved 8 February 2007. The purpose of this history page is to portray the current Mwami Mwenda chiefs and their founder, Msiri, in a heroic light. Three out of the five Europeans returned to Europe. Stairs reached the lower Zambezi but died there of malaria. In 1998 Congolese artist Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu said: Katanga after Msiri The expedition's askaris massacred many of Msiri's people that day at Munema, and the population dispersed. On condition he sign CFS treaties, Stairs installed Msiri's adopted son as chief in his place but of a much reduced area, and restored the Wasanga chieftainships which Msiri had overthrown 30 years before. The Stairs Expedition left after seven weeks when another CFS expedition (the Bia Expedition) arrived from north. It was too small to maintain effective control, and moved to eastern Katanga. Left without any CFS troops to keep the peace, disorder and instability occupied the vacuum left by Msiri for some time as the chiefs fought among themselves, and Dan Crawford moved to Lake Mweru and set up a mission to which many Garanganze moved to escape the strife. The British accepted the Congo Free State's possession of Katanga (the administration of which Leopold vested in the Compagnie du Katanga) and an Anglo-Belgian agreement was signed in 1894. The slave trade from south-east Katanga to Lake Tanganyika declined, though in the Congo Free State slavery as practiced by King Leopold II's agents did not end until after the country was taken over by the Belgian state in 1908. Some of the Garanganze people returned to Bunkeya and continued the Garanganze chieftaincy which, despite internal exile for some years, continues to this day, using the name 'Mwami Mwenda' after Msiri's first name, ruling a population of about 20,000. Evaluation According to one European source: Cruel punishments boma at Bunkeya. The objects on top of the four poles, below which some of Msiri's warriors are gathered, are heads of his enemies. More skulls are on the stakes forming the stockade. Msiri was said to punish his enemies and other miscreants by mutilation (cutting off ears), burial up to the neck and being left to starve, or being shut up in a hut to be eaten by a pack of starving dogs.Moloney 1893, Chapter X. Moloney does not say from where this information comes. Execution by beheading was certainly carried out, as witnessed by the heads placed on poles. Ironically the Stairs expedition meted out the same treatment to Msiri himself (and Leopold's regime in the Congo Free State hung heads and bodies of villagers on fences as a warning to others of what happened to those who did not fulfil their rubber quota).Hochschild, Adam (1999). King Leopold's Ghost. Pan. . Msiri's capital Bunkeya and surrounding villages had a population estimated at 60,000‚Äì80,000 in 1891. A year after Msiri's death, it was 10,000‚Äì20,000. In that part of Africa people disperse into the bush when threatened. For instance, David Livingstone reported twenty years earlier that Mwata Kazembe VIII Chinkonkole Kafuti so tyrannised his people that many had moved away, and he could muster scarcely 1000 men. Continuing the contrast with Msiri, when the assassins sent by Msiri and Tippu Tib advanced on his boma, Chinkonkole Kafuti's people did not warn him, but let him be taken by surprise. Arnot's description of Msiri Of the contemporary written accounts of Msiri, all were by or based on accounts of people in the pay of either Leopold or the BSAC, the only exception being Arnot and his missionary colleagues, the closest there were to neutral observers. Arnot referred to Msiri as \\"a thorough gentleman,\\" and established a working relationship with him, with a certain amount of mutual respect. Msiri gave Arnot land to build his own hut, a small clinic, a church, and a school. When Arnot returned to London he recruited three more missionaries to go to Msiri in Bunkeya. Arnot's diaries say of living in Bunkeya: The Stairs Expedition's reports A political quotations website offers these as the last words of Omer Bodson: Moloney, the Stairs Expedition's doctor, wrote up his account on his return to London in 1892.Moloney 1893. For more information on the author and the book, see Joseph Moloney and Stairs Expedition. Influenced by the writings of men such as Livingstone, public opinion in Britain began to clamor for reforms which benefited the indigenous subjects of the British Empire.Barnett, Corelli (1986). The Audit of War: The Illusion and Reality of Britain as a Great Nation. London: Macmillan. Moloney noted that Msiri had his \\"apologists\\" in London.Moloney 1893, p. 178. King Leopold had to legitimise his Congo Free State's claim to Katanga under the Berlin Conference's Principle of Effectivity, so a justification for the killing of Msiri was required. The Stairs Expedition's reports were used in Europe to emphasise self-defence as the reason for his death, coupled with the claim he was a bloodthirsty tyrant.Ravenstein, E. G. (1893). \\"Recent Explorations in the South-Eastern Congo Basin\\", The Geographical Journal, 1 (3). Moloney's quotation of Bodson's dramatic dying words helped in this respect. The question remains as to whether Msiri was being described as a bloodthirsty tyrant to the same extent before he was killed, when his signature to a treaty was being assiduously courted by the imperial powers.

Plot Incompetent Dr Benjamin Twist (Will Hay) is dismissed from his job as headmaster at St. Michael's School (the school returns in a later film The Ghost of St. Michael's), and applies for a job in another school. Going for interview, he is called into another office where they are expecting John Benjamin, a strict prison governor recently arrived from Australia who is applying for the vacancy at Blackdown Prison in Devon. On the way to what Twist believes is the school, he becomes drunk, and on arrival is mistaken for Max Slessor, a prisoner who had escaped during a jailbreak. Designated Convict 99 and in for seven years for forgery, Twist is soon discovered to be the new Prison Governor, and once put in his (dubiously) rightful place embarks on a programme to make the prison a more friendly place for the prisoners, funding it from the proceeds of a football pools win and stock market investments. Things take a turn for the worse, when the recaptured Slessor escapes again with a signed cheque. Altering the figures, he draws the entire prison funds from the bank. Twist and some of the convicts head in a prison van to Limehouse, in east London, to catch Slessor, recover the lost funds and then successfully break into the bank in the middle of the night to return the money.

It is part of accident investigation or incident investigation. These analyses may be performed by a range of experts, including forensic scientists, forensic engineers or health and safety advisers. Accident investigators, particularly those in the aircraft industry, are colloquially known as \\"tin-kickers\\". Health and safety and patient safety professionals prefer using the term \\"incident\\" in place of the term \\"accident\\". Its retrospective nature means that accident analysis is primarily an exercise of directed explanation; conducted using the theories or methods the analyst has to hand, which directs the way in which the events, aspects, or features of accident phenomena are highlighted and explained. Sequence Accident analysis is performed in four steps: #Fact gathering: After an accident, a forensic process is started to gather all possibly relevant facts that may contribute to understanding the accident. #Fact Analysis: After the forensic process has been completed or at least delivered some results, the facts are put together to give a \\"big picture.\\" The history of the accident is reconstructed and checked for consistency and plausibility. #Conclusion Drawing: If the accident history is sufficiently informative, conclusions can be drawn about causation and contributing factors. #Counter-measures: In some cases, the development of counter-measures or recommendations are made to prevent further accidents of the same kind. Methods There exist numerous forms of Accident Analysis methods. These can be divided into three categories: #Causal Analysis uses the principle of causality to determine the course of events. Though people casually speak of a \\"chain of events\\", results from Causal Analysis usually have the form of directed a-cyclic graphsthe nodes being events and the edges the cause-effect relations. Methods of Causal Analysis differ in their respective notion of causation. #Expert Analysis relies on the knowledge and experience of field experts. This form of analysis usually lacks a rigorous (formal/semiformal) methodological approach. This usually affects falsifiability and objectivity of analyses. This is of importance when conclusions are heavily disputed among experts. #Organizational Analysis relies on systemic theories of organization. Most theories imply that if a system's behaviour stayed within the bounds of the ideal organization then no accidents can occur. Organizational Analysis can be falsified and results from analyses can be checked for objectivity. Choosing an organizational theory for accident analysis comes from the assumption that the system to be analysed conforms to that theory. Models Many models have been described to characterise and analyse accidents. The book Enhancing Occupational Safety and Health is one source of further details on the different types of models used in accident analysis. Using photographs to extract evidence Once all available data has been collected by accident scene investigators and law enforcement officers, camera matching, photogrammetry or rectification can be used to determine the exact location of physical evidence shown in the accident scene photos. #Camera matching: Camera matching uses accident scene photos that show various points of evidence. The technique uses CAD software to create a 3-dimensional model of the accident site and roadway surface. All survey data and photos are then imported into a three dimensional software package like 3D Studio Max. A virtual camera can be then be positioned relative to the 3D roadway surface. Physical evidence is then mapped from the photos onto the 3D roadway to create a three dimensional accident scene drawing. #Photogrammetry: Photogrammetry is used to determine the three-dimensional geometry of an object on the accident scene from the original two dimensional photos. The photographs can be used to extract evidence that may be lost after the accident is cleared. Photographs from several viewpoints are imported into software like PhotoModeler. The forensic engineer can then choose points common to each photo. The software will calculate the location of each point in a three dimensional coordinate system. #Rectification: Photographic rectification is also used to analyze evidence that may not have been measured at the accident scene. Two dimensional rectification transforms a single photograph into a top-down view. Software like PC-Rect can be used to rectify a digital photograph.Extracting Physical Evidence from Digital Photographs for use in Forensic Accident Reconstruction, David Danaher, P.E., Jeff Ball, Ph.D., P.E., and Mark Kittel, P.E 2012-06-15.

In 1970 he began working with Richard Branson and helped to found The Manor Studio in Oxford for the nascent Virgin Records. There, he produced the recording of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. Career In 1968 he played in a band called July whose only album was the eponymous \\"July\\" on UK Major Minor and US Epic. Prior to that, he was in a British band called \\"The Tomcats\\" who were based in Spain. In 1966, they recorded at least three EP's on Spanish Philips (436387, 436388 and 436826). In 1970, Newman began working with Richard Branson and helped build The Manor Studio in Oxford. It was there he met the 18-year-old Mike Oldfield who lent him a rough demo tape of what would become Tubular Bells. In November 1973, Newman participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Tubular Bells for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield's Elements DVD. Newman released some albums as a solo musician and produced several albums for other artists, most notably Mike Oldfield (Tubular Bells, Tubular Bells II, Heaven's Open). Reviewing Newman's 1977 Fine Old Tom LP, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \\"Tom seems to have recorded this far across the sea in 1975, but more than that even my Anglophile sources can't tell me. Analogies: Dave Edmunds (studiomania and general non-esoteric musical orientation, although Newman isn't interested in overpowering anyone), Ray Davies (vaguely but persistently, for both eccentricity and vocal approach), Eno (more precisely, not only for eccentricity and vocal approach but also for style of smarts, although Newman isn't so blatantly avant-garde).

Biography  He was born at Lyons in 1793. He first studied theology in the seminary of Argentiere, and afterward pursued the study of law. He passed his law examination but never practiced the legal profession, having decided to enter on a literary career. He soon left his native city and settled in Paris, where he opened a bookstore and at the same time was active with his pen. He died in Paris on 21 February 1851. Writings His first publications, concerning the French Revolution, Napoleon and the Bourbon Restoration, were \\"La lanterne magique\\" (1811); \\"Blanc, bleu et rouge\\" (1814) and a \\"Tableau historique des √©v√©nements qui se sont accomplis depuis le retour de Bonaparte jusqu'au r√©tablissement de Louis XVII\\" (1815). He contributed to the \\"Journal de Lyon\\" founded by Pierre-Simon Ballanche. Once in Paris, he first published articles of a political cast, and historical tales in the style of the time, such as \\"Michel Morin et la Ligue\\"; \\"Florence ou la Religieuse\\"; \\"Le R√©gicide\\" and others. He then took up historical writing, his first work of this kind is \\"Le Concordat entre L√©on X et Fran√ßois I\\" (1821), which is, for the most part, a translation of the Concordat between pope Leo X and renaissance king Francis I of France. This was followed by his \\"Histoire de la St. Barth√©lemy\\" (2 volumes, 1826) on the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August 1572. These two works were fairly well-received although some ecclesiastical critics accused him of being too favorable to the Protestants. Audin publicly defended himself against this imputation and asserted his firm belief in the doctrines of the Catholic Church. He now began his most important work, the history of the Protestant Reformation, which he published from 1839 to 1842 in four books, as follows: # \\"Histoire de la vie, des ouvrages et de la doctrine de Luther\\" (2 volumes, Paris, 1839; 2d ed., 3 volumes, 1850) on Martin Luther # \\"Histoire de la vie, des ouvrages et de la doctrine de Calvin\\" (2 volumes, 1841; 2d ed., 1851) on John Calvin # \\"Histoire de L√©on X et de son siecle\\" (2 volumes, 1844; 2d ed., 1851) on pope Leo X's time # \\"Histoire de Henri VIII et du schisme d'Angleterre\\" (2 volumes, 1847; 2d ed., 1862) on Henry VIII Tudor and the Anglican Schism. The author claims to have based his statements upon researches which he made in the archives of various European cities, especially in the archives of the Vatican. The work shows that this assertion cannot be accepted in its entirety. The volumes are written in a romantic manner, and contain many particulars which sober criticism has long proved to go false. Johann Joseph Ignaz von D√∂llinger said of the work on Luther: \\"Audin's work is written with an extraordinary and at times almost naive ignorance of Luther's writings and contemporary literature, and of the general condition of Germany at that period\\" (Kirchenlexikon, s.v.

He represents the Karimnagar constituency of Telangana State and previously represented Hanamkonda in the 14th Lok Sabha (2004-2009). He is one of the founding members of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party and is presently a politburo member and the party's deputy Floor Leader in the Lok Sabha. Early life Vinod Kumar Boianapalli was born in Karimnagar, Telangana on 22 July 1959. He has a younger brother and a younger sister. His parents are B. Muralidhar Rao and B. Sugunadevi. His father was a state government employee in the revenue department in Warangal district. His paternal family is an agricultural family from Enugal village, Warangal. His maternal family is politically prominent and hails from Nagaram village, Karimnagar. Chennamaneni Rajeshwar Rao, freedom fighter and Communist party leader, Chennamaneni Hanumantha Rao, former Planning Commission member and former Chancellor of University of Hyderabad, Chennameneni Venkateshwar Rao, social worker and Chennamaneni Vidyasagar Rao present Governor of Maharashtra are his maternal uncles.  Education and student politics  Vinod Kumar Boianapalli did his schooling from Nehru Memorial School, Desaipet village, Warangal. He completed his intermediate education in biology, physics and chemistry from Government Junior College, Hanamakonda. He did his Bachelor's in Science in Government Kakatiya Degree College and LL.B. at the University College of Law, Kakatiya University. Vinod Kumar joined politics at the young age of 14 when he came into contact with the left-wing All India Students Federation (AISF), which was the student wing of the Communist Party of India (CPI). He became deeply involved in student politics and rose to become a student leader. He held various office bearer posts in the AISF state and national committees and also in the university students union. During his student days he participated in various public movements and agitations in Warangal. Advocate profession Vinod Kumar enrolled as an advocate in the year 1984. He practiced as a lawyer in Warangal district till 1998. Later, he started his practice in the Andhra Pradesh High Court at Hyderabad. He is a member of the Andhra Pradesh Bar Council. Political career Vinod Kumar enrolled as a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI) in the late 1970s and held various organizational posts in the party. He was the district assistant secretary in Warangal and went on to become a member of the state council. Apart from his political activism he also participated in various people's movements, national and international seminars on world peace and was an active member of the Indo-Soviet cultural society.  TRS party and Telangana Movement  When the Telangana Movement was renewed in the late 1990s, Vinod Kumar was at the forefront. He participated in many debates, seminars and round table meetings on the backwardness of the Telangana region vis-a-vis Coastal Andhra. Along with K. Chandrashekar Rao, he was a founding member of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party which was launched on 27 April 2001 with the sole agenda of forming a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as capital. Since then he began playing a key role in the TRS party and the Telangana movement.  Election Results   2014   2004  Member of Parliament First term (2004‚Äì2009) Mobilising support for Telangana In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections he contested from Hanamkonda in Warangal and won it with the highest percentage of votes in Andhra Pradesh. As a Member of Parliament he played an important role along with TRS party chief K. Chandrashekar Rao in convincing 32 political parties on the issue of Telangana statehood. At the outset there was virtually no national-level support and the movement was dismissed as a ploy by politicians to grab power. However through persistent dialogue parties were brought on board and eventually letters of support were taken and submitted to the Pranab Mukherjee sub-committee which was set up to examine the statehood demand. He protested against the UPA for not keeping its promise of delivering Telangana by resigning from his Lok Sabha seat in March 2008. However the seat was regained by him in the subsequent by-election. As a people's representative, he undertook many developmental activities for his constituency. Bhupalapally power plant Through his efforts, a power project was set up at Bhupalapally coal belt in Warangal district. It was in partnership with the Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Rural Electrification Corporation at a total cost of Rs. 2000 crore. Widening of NH 163 National Highway 163 was formerly known as NH 202 Hyderabad-Bhopalpatnam passes through Warangal and was widened due to the intervention of Vinod Kumar as it was the site of frequent accidents. A particularly major one on Independence Day 2005 took ten lives and injured forty-five and this prompted Kumar to raise and pursue the issue of widening NH 202. His persistent intervention in Parliament also resulted in the construction of a high level bridge which crosses the Godavari river near Etunagaram village to cross the border into Bhopalapatnam in Chhattisgarh. Restoration of thousand pillar temple The kalyanamandapam of the iconic thousand pillar temple of Hanamkonda was dilapidated and its restoration work was pending for many years. After becoming an MP Kumar raised the issue in 2007 with the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, the Centre as well as the Archaeological Survey of India. The Centre released funds of Rs. 3 crores after his persistent intervention. The subsequent pace of restoration picked up and is now close to completion. Drinking water supply and heritage city status for Warangal The city of Warangal suffered from shortages of drinking water supply. Vinod took up the issue and tried to get the city included within the eligibility list for the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewable Mission (JNNURM). However, as a population of 10 lakh was required the city could not be included. Nevertheless, his efforts resulted in Warangal municipal corporation being given Rs. 178 crore in 2007 for implementing a drinking water project. This project aimed at improving the drinking water system for the city and included plans for increasing the storage capacity of the Dharmasagar and Bhadrakali tanks, connecting them through pipelines to existing filter beds and constructing new filter beds. The plan was successfully executed and met the drinking water needs of the city. Vinod also held discussions with the then Chief Minister YSR to grant heritage city status to Warangal, owing to its historic identity as capital of the Kakatiya dynasty. The demand was not acceded to immediately but was finally considered in 2015 by the NDA Government which granted Warangal heritage city status under the Hriday scheme. Tourism development for Laknavaram lake As Member of Parliament, Vinod facilitated the state Department of Tourism‚Äôs plans to develop Laknavaram lake in Warangal district as a tourist spot. A wooden suspension bridge was constructed at a cost of Rs. 40 lakh to connect an island in the middle of the lake with the river bank. Haritha hotel was also constructed in Hanamkonda. Kanthanapally irrigation project The Kanthanapally mega irrigation project in Warangal district was launched as a result of a movement by the TRS. It was aimed at storing 100 tmc of water of which 30 tmc could be supplied to nearby Warangal, Nalgonda and Hyderabad districts for drinking water purposes. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) project was conceptualised by Telangana engineers and their ideas were put into practice through the political activism of the TRS. Babli project Vinod filed a petition in the Supreme Court on the controversial Babli project. This resulted in the apex court directing the Central government to appoint a high-level technical committee on Godavari river water sharing. Telangana Movement (2009‚Äì2014) Due to the reorganisation of constituencies for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Hanamkonda was declared an SC reserved constituency. Vinod Kumar had to contest from Karimnagar instead of Warangal. Owing to inadequate time for campaigning he lost the election. Despite this he continued to work at the ground level on various public issues. He threw himself completely into the Telangana movement and started playing an even more vital role in the TRS party. As Karimnagar district TRS party in charge he actively toured the district during the Telangana agitation. As among the key aids of KCR he was at the forefront of taking many important decisions during the turbulent phase of 2009‚Äì14. Legal issues regarding bifurcation A practicing advocate, he brought his legal acumen to several of the legislative debates on bifurcation. He argued that article 371D of the Constitution of India would not be a hurdle to the creation of Telangana.http://www.deccanchronicle.com/131021/commentary-dc- comment/commentary/article-371d-not-hurdle-telangana He also provided clarity on the necessary constitutional amendments required to facilitate smooth bifurcation, whether 2/3rds majority of the House was necessary for the passage of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 and the role of Section 8 of the Act which dealt with law and order. Vinod also took an active role in fighting cases filed by political leaders from Andhra Pradesh in the Supreme Court to try and prevent the bifurcation of the state. Such activities provided intellectual firepower to the Telangana agitators and built their confidence. Steel plant in Khammam In April 2013 the Bayyaram iron ore mines in Khammam and Warangal districts were allocated by a Government Order (GO) to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. This was severely opposed by TRS leaders including Kumar who alleged that this was a continuation of the loot of natural resources from Telangana by Seemandhra rulers. They demanded that a steel plant be set up in the Telangana region itself so as to provide employment to the locals who were far more deprived than their Seemandhra counterparts. Vinod coined the popular slogan ‚ÄòBayyaramu ukku Telangana hakku‚Äô (Bayyaram‚Äôs ore is Telangana‚Äôs right) which became a rallying cry for the agitation. Medical seats to Telangana Vinod actively pursued the issue of non- allocation of additional seats for three prestigious medical colleges‚ÄîGandhi, Osmania and Kakatiya‚Äîin the Telangana region. He questioned the disparity between differential allocation for Seemandhra and Telangana colleges and demanded that the then chief minister KKR camp at Delhi and build pressure on the Prime Minister's office to get 150 additional medical seats (50 each) to the three colleges. He also met the Medical Council of India (MCI) secretary Professor Sanjai Srivastava and discussed the issue with him. Second term (2014‚Äì) Performance statistics for Vinod Kumar Boianapalli from 1 June 2014 to 13 May 2015 In 2014 he contested in the general elections for the Lok Sabha from Karimnagar constituency and won with a huge margin of 2.04 lakhs. The state of Telangana was created the next month on 2 June 2014, bringing the 60-year-old movement to a close. As a senior leader of the TRS and one of the foremost leaders of the Telangana movement Vinod was appointed as the deputy floor leader of the TRS party in the Lok Sabha. This position is being used to ensure that all issues relevant to Telangana are raised in Parliament and that the TRS MPs get equal opportunities to speak on issues. Polavaram controversy On 29 May 2014 the NDA Government issued an ordinance transferring 136 villages, 211 hamlets and seven mandals from Khammam district in Telangana to East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh for the sake of the Polavaram Project. This was vehemently opposed by the TRS which argued that it would lead to the displacement of 3 lakh tribals. The BJD opposed the increase in the height of the dam, arguing that it was an arbitrary increase that would lead to the inundation of 307 villages in Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Vinod Kumar fought against the move inside and outside the Parliament. He filed two petitions in the Supreme Court, challenging both the ordinance and the design of the dam. When the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2014 was introduced in Parliament to replace the ordinance, he moved a statutory resolution under article 123 (1) (a) of the constitution against the House taking up the Bill. He also raised a point of order in Parliament during the debate, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutional as it had been issued when the separate Telangana State had already been formed. The President before issuing the ordinance had not elicited the views of the legislative assemblies of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, as was needed for altering boundaries of the two states. Therefore, the bill was not valid under Article 3 of the Constitution. Nevertheless, as the NDA had superior numbers in the Lok Sabha the Bill was passed. Manoharabad-Kothapalli railway line Karimnagar town is the only district headquarters in Telangana which is not connected to the state headquarters. The 146 km Manoharabad-Kothapalli railway line passes Vemulawada, which houses the famous Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Temple known as Dakshina Kashi. It then goes via Sircilla and Siddipet towns and aims to connect Karimnagar to Secunderabad. The line was first proposed by the current Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao when he was the MP for Karimnagar during 2004-09 and was subsequently pursued by Vinod Kumar. The Centre agreed to the proposal on the condition that the State government share one-third cost of construction of the railway project, provide land free of cost and also bear annuity for the first five years after commissioning of the project. The State government agreed to the conditions and Kumar‚Äôs efforts were fruitful when Rs. 20 crore was sanctioned in the union rail budget 2015‚Äì16 for the line. The government of Telangana has also released funds for acquiring land for the railway. Bifurcation of AP High Court Section 31 and 32 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act provide for the bifurcation of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. However delay in the process of bifurcation led TRS leaders to protest against the Government stating that no action was taken even after nine months. Vinod frequently brought up the issue in Parliament and alleged that the issue was being stalled on some pretext or the other. He argued that only six out of the total 29 judges were from Telangana and this led to discrimination in the handling of cases. He even demanded the Prime Minister‚Äôs intervention after discussions with the Law Minister did not yield results. Increase in seats in Legislative Assemblies Section 26 (1) of the AP Reorganisation Act states that the number of legislative assemblies in Telangana be increased from 119 to 153. However this has been held up by the Ministry of Home Affairs which has stated that the provisions of the section are subject to article 170 of the Constitution which prevents assembly seat increases from taking place till the year 2026. Vinod has been pursuing the issue in Parliament and has even asked for the Prime Minister‚Äôs intervention, arguing that there is no justification for the inclusion of article 170 in Section 26 and the words ‚Äònotwithstanding‚Äô should have been used instead of ‚Äòsubject to‚Äô. He has also introduced a private member‚Äôs bill seeking to amendment the Act to this effect. General Budget 2014‚Äì15 Some of the points madehttp://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/Result16.aspx?dbsl=448http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/Result16.aspx?dbsl=1931 by Vinod on the general budget were: * Government should have kept its promise of giving income tax relief up to Rs. 5 lakh income as promised in the manifesto. * Finance Minister should ensure that Committee of Finance Ministry, SMSE Ministry and RBI on MSMEs completes its work within the specific timeframe. * Mahabubnagar district should be considered for Ultra Mega Solar Power Project. * Finance Minister should sanction one IIM, one Medical College and AIIMS to Telangana state as the higher education has been neglected in Telangana State during the combined Andhra Pradesh State. * Finance Minister should allocate more funds in Revised Estimates. * Government should allocate some funds for opening up of Jan Aushadhis across the country so that the poor can purchase generic drugs in those pharmacies. Railway Budget 2015‚Äì16 The demands made on the rail budget were as follows: * Completion of Peddapalle-Nizamabad project. * Declaration of railway division in Kazipet. * Renaming of AP-Express as Telangana Express. * Initiation of more rail projects in Telangana as rail line coverage in the state is less than the national average. * Govt should bring out a white paper stating by when they would complete all the pending projects. * As 88% of freight is carried on road, railways should encourage more freight to go onto it. * Bullet trains should also be initiated to connect all the metros of the country. Contributions to legislative debates In addition to raising the issues of his state, Vinod Kumar has actively participated in debates surrounding national issues as well. He is a member of the standing committee on water resources and a member of the consultative committee on health and family welfare. He is also currently a member of the Joint Select Committee (JSC) that is examining the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Amendment) Bill, 2015. Land acquisition Vinod represented the TRS party view on the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Amendment) Bill, 2015, popularly known as the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. The points raised by him were as follows: * Government should say which States are facing trouble in implementing the Act as implementation had not even begun. * Consent and Social Impact Assessment provisions should be included in the main Bill and TRS party to oppose the amendment if this demand is not met. * Telangana State framed Rules under section 112 of the Act which stated that implementation officials had to prepare a database of wastelands in the state. Suggestion accepted by Central Govt and brought in as an amendment. * Land acquisition powers were historically misused for land grab and diversion to real estate. National Judicial Appointments Commission Vinod Kumar represented the TRS party view on the contentious NJAC and wholeheartedly supported the Bill. He statedhttp://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/Result16.aspx?dbsl=1124 that the regulations of the Act should be framed at the earliest as they would contain details of how judicial appointments would be made. Given the importance of this procedure, the Parliament should be kept informed by the Government. He also called for the creation of a dedicated all-India judicial service. Goods and Services Tax The following points were made by Vinod on the Constitution (122nd Amendment) (GST) Bill, 2014: * Supported the Bill with reservations. * Welcome Central move to create a fund and make compensation claims a legal right. * States should be given freedom to levy local taxes if the situation warrants. * Clarity required on unclear how current exemptions including area-based exemptions such as SEZs and Export Oriented Units (EOUs) will be treated with regard to levy of GST. * Clarity required on the place of supply will have to be clearly defined to avoid disputes among states in the case of inter-state transactions. * Timeline for transition must be commercially feasible and realistically-acceptable for businesses to avoid transfer to price rise to consumers. * Adequate training should be provided to relevant professionals such as tax administrators and tax professionals. * IT infrastructure should be given focus as it is the backbone for implementation. Black Money Bill The following points were made on the Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, popularly known as the Black Money Bill: * Supported the Bill with reservations. * Limited efforts taken so far in bringing back black money. * Certain provisions of the Act regarding foreign assets are unrealistic and can be used to harass NRIs who want to invest in India. * Certain provisions of the Act can lead to double taxation of income and should be corrected. * Act does not contain provision for stay of recovery of the tax and penalty, even though one may have filed an appeal against an incorrect demand raised by tax authorities. This will definitely encourage corruption by tax authorities. * Move towards an amnesty known as a ‚Äòone-time settlement‚Äô is questionable given the failure of previous such efforts in the past. * Government should recognise countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, etc. as tax havens. * Participatory Notes should be abolished immediately. * Tax administration should be reformed and strengthened. * Government should create/amend laws that put a limit to how much cash an individual can carry. Juvenile Justice Bill, 2014 The following points were made on the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill, 2014: * Opposed the Bill. * Highlighted the fact that most juveniles have become like that because of a lifetime of poverty, violence, abuse and neglect and these are the main causes responsible. * Opposed the trial of juveniles as adults under the provisions of the Bill and asked for more emphasis on rehabilitation and reform. Constituency development (2014‚Äì) Vinod Kumar has taken several measures for the development of his birthplace and constituency of Karimnagar. Some of them are: Adopted backward and tribal Veernapalli village under Pradhan Mantri Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana. Many developmental activities have been started: # Opened Telangana Grameen Bank branch. # Requested and got 3G Telecom services for the village. # Requested and obtained sanction from Petroleum Minister for one LPG Outlet and one retail outlet at Veernapalli village. # Took initiatives to increase ground water level. # Organised mega awareness camp for adolescent girls along with Rainbow NGO and district officials. # Health camp and animal health camp. # Weekly cleanliness drive conducted. # Improving service delivery in anganwadi, schools and PDS. # Tree planting drive with 100+ trees planted already. # Rozgar Divas conducted every Tuesday for giving work orders and payment slips. * Facilitated supply of water from Lower Manair Dam to Vemulawada and Husnabad towns of Karimnagar parliamentary constituency. * Obtained sanctions from Human Resource Development Minister Smt Smriti Irani for construction of 3,575 toilets in 1922 schools of Karimnagar Parliamentary Constituency.

Overview The museum is named after Sir Alfred Herbert, a Coventry industrialist and philanthropist whose gifts enabled the original building to be opened in 1960. Building began in 1939, with an interruption by the Second World War, and the Herbert opened in 1960. In 2008, it reopened after a ¬£14 million refurbishment. The Herbert is run by Culture Coventry, a registered charity, and admission is free. It derives financial support from donations, sales at the museum shop, and hiring the buildings out. In 2010, the museum and gallery received more than 300,000 visitors, making it one of the most popular free tourist attractions in the West Midlands. History The covered court of the museum and art gallery in 2011 Benedictine Museum and foundation: Pre-war Museums in Coventry before the Herbert included the museum of the Coventry City Guild and the Benedictine Museum, opened by J. B. Shelton in the 1930s. However, Coventry City Council's collection of art treasures and museum pieces were housed in various buildings and so the council acquired a half acre site over a number of years costing ¬£35,375. In 1938 the philanthropist Sir Alfred Herbert donated ¬£100,000 to the Corporation to erect a Gallery and Museum on the site.Sir A. Herbert's Gift To Coventry, The Times, 26 October 1938 Plans were drawn up by the Leicester architect Albert Herbert, a cousin of Sir Alfred, and building began the following year. The city's destruction during the Coventry Blitz meant construction was suspended with only the basement completed. City architect Donald Gibson's radical rebuilding plan for Coventry city centre became war time propaganda for the post-war reconstruction of Britain. But, post-war economies required Gibson to concentrate on a building programme for the suburbs. Completion of the first building under his plan was delayed until 1953.Andrew Saint, ‚ÄòGibson, Sir Donald Edward Evelyn (1908‚Äì1991)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 New plans for the museum were drawn up in 1952 by the Leicester architects, Albert Herbert & Son, and in May 1954 the foundation stone was laid by Herbert, who also donated a further ¬£100,000 to the project. Herbert died in May 1957, and the museum and art gallery that bears his name was opened on 9 March 1960 by his third wife Lady Herbert. Refurbishment: 2005‚Äì2008 The first phase of a two-phase refurbishment was completed in 2005 with ¬£3 million of funds from Coventry City Council, Advantage West Midlands and the European Regional Development Fund. During the refurbishment, it was considered that a painting by seventeenth-century artist Luca Giordano was too large and fragile to be moved. Instead the canvas, which has been with The Herbert since the 1960s and described as one of the museum's most prized paintings, was boarded up in 2005 and uncovered three years later in time for the opening. In early 2008, the second phase was completed at a cost of ¬£14 million. A new entrance on Bayley Lane was provided, along with a 500 sq metre glass-covered court extension. The extended buildings include a new cafe area, education, training, creative media and arts information facilities, additional gallery spaces for temporary exhibitions, and facilities for conservation work and to preserve the city records and archive. Culture Coventry The Herbert is part of Culture Coventry, which also manages three additional local heritage sites: Coventry Transport Museum, the Old Grammar School, and the Lunt Roman Fort situated three miles outside Coventry at Baginton. The museum won the Guardian Family Friendly Award 2010. The same year, the gallery was shortlisted for the Art Fund Prize in recognition of its outstanding work in engaging new and diverse audiences. Collections Lady Godiva, 1897, by John Collier Permanent gallery spaces include Sculpture, Old Masters paintings, Art Since 1900, local history and Elements (Natural History). The museum's notable collections include a costume collection dating from around 1800 to date, with the emphasis on nineteenth-century women's wear. The museum is now concentrating on the acquisition of more modern clothes and items from different ethnic communities in Coventry. Another collection represents the city's history as a centre for ribbon making, which includes over 250 sample books, as well as woven Stevengraphs ‚Äì a form of silk picture and bookmark, together with dyer's samples, documents, woven badges and related machinery. The Heritage Lottery Fund granted nearly ¬£200,000 to The Herbert and Wolverhampton Art Gallery in 2008 for acquisitions in relation to the theme of peace and reconciliation. In 2011, the museum raised ¬£12,000 to buy The Coventry Album, a collection of paintings by William Henry Brooke in 1819. The album is one of the most important collection of historic pictures of Coventry. Other heritage sites Culture Coventry also administers three other local heritage sites: * Coventry Transport Museum is a motor museum, located in Coventry City Centre, England. It houses a collection of British-made road transport. It is located in Coventry because the city was previously the centre of the British car industry. There are more than 240 cars and commercial vehicles, 100 motorcycles, 200 bicycles. * The Lunt Roman Fort is located in Baginton, about 3 miles from Coventry city centre, where there is a modern partial reconstruction of the fort that was established there in AD 60\\\\. * The Old Grammar School is a Grade I listed building in Coventry, England on the corner of Bishop Street and Hales Street. Coventry Archives Researchers in the History Centre Coventry Archives is housed in The Herbert. Made up of what was the Coventry archives and Coventry local history, it houses the largest collection of records related to Coventry and its history. In 2018 Coventry Archives was re-branded from the previous name, Coventry History Centre. Temporary exhibitions and special projects In 2005, The Herbert hosted a theatre project for children, showing them what it would have been like to be evacuees in the 1940s. The event won two awards, one for excellence in the field of heritage and the other for engaging children with history. There are four temporary exhibition spaces, and the temporary exhibition programme includes exhibition from national and international galleries such as The British Museum, V&A;, Southbank Centre and Natural History Museum. Self-created exhibitions also explore local themes and social history. In 2009 the Herbert hosted a collection of fifty watercolours from British artists such as J. M. W. Turner and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In 2010, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the museum's opening, the Herbert held several events throughout the year. In March more than 1,000 people attended a special event where ten objects, including a sixteenth- century tapestry and Shakespeare's ring, illustrating the history of Warwickshire, were put on display. In 2018, the Herbert hosted two major exhibitions. PLAY was an exhibition created in collaboration with the video game studio, Rare, and featured the history of the company's games. There was also a large section dedicated to the types of play that humans partake in. There was also a fad wall where visitors were encouraged to write their favourite fads. Visitors praised the exhibition for is interactability and emphasis on having fun inside the exhibition space. The second major exhibition in 2018 was the ARTIST ROOMS: Anselm Kiefer. One of Germany‚Äôs most significant post-war artists, Kiefer‚Äôs work explores themes of national identity and collective memory.

It instructs students in grades 9 through 12. History Completed in 1981, North Stafford High School was the second high school to be built in Stafford County. Robert White served as the school's principal from 1981 until 1997. Numerous changes occurred in the school during the next five years under the guidance of principals Henry Johnson and James Stemple including changing the school's colors to the current colors of Navy blue, Columbia blue, and Orange. The school underwent major renovations in 2003 including the construction of an additional wing on the school for foreign language and to account for overcrowding. The renovation also included adding a new art studio and weight room. In the 2004-2005 school year, James Stemple left to be principal at the newly constructed Mountain View High School and was replaced by Tom Nichols. Nichols left in 2016 and was replaced by former Brooke Point principal Scott McClellan. In the beginning of 2017, Scott McClellan was replaced by interim principal Jeanna DeCarli. Former assistant principal Daniel Hornick was hired and named the official principal of North Stafford High School in June 2017.

S. lanata), the lamb's-ear (lamb's ear) or woolly hedgenettle, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae, native to Turkey, Armenia, and Iran.Euro+Med Plantbase: Stachys byzantinaHuxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . It is cultivated over much of the temperate world as an ornamental plant, and is naturalised in some locations as an escapee from gardens. Plants are very often found under the synonym Stachys lanata or Stachys olympica. Lamb's-ear flowers in late spring and early summer; plants produce tall spike-like stems with a few reduced leaves. The flowers are small and light purple. The plants tend to be evergreen but can \\"die\\" back during cold winters and regenerate new growth from the crowns. Description Lamb's-ears are herbaceous perennials, usually densely covered with gray or silver-white, silky-lanate hairs. They are named lamb's ears because of the leaves' curved shape and white, soft, fur-like hair coating. Flowering stems are erect, often branched, and tend to be 4-angled, growing 40‚Äì80 cm tall. The leaves are thick and somewhat wrinkled, densely covered on both sides with gray-silver colored, silky-lanate hairs; the undersides are more silver-white in color than the top surfaces. The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems and 5 to 10 cm long. The leaf petioles are semiamplexicaul (the bases wrapping half way around the stem) with the basal leaves having blades oblong-elliptic in shape, measuring 10 cm long and 2.5 cm wide (though variation exists in cultivated forms). The leaf margins are crenulate but covered with dense hairs, the leaf apexes attenuate, gradually narrowing to a rounded point. Flowers The flowering spikes are 10‚Äì22 cm long, producing verticillasters that each have many flowers and are crowded together over most of the length on the spike-like stem. The leaves produced on the flowering stems are greatly reduced in size and subsessile, the lower ones slightly longer than the interscholastic and the upper ones shorter than the verticillasters. The leaf bracteoles are linear to linear- lanceolate in shape and 6 mm long. The flowers have no pedicels (sessile) and the calyx is tubular-campanulate in shape, being slightly curved and 1.2 cm long. The calyx is glabrous except for the inside surface of the teeth, having 10 veins with the accessory veins inconspicuous. The 2‚Äì3 mm long calyx teeth are ovate-triangular in shape and are subequal or the posterior teeth larger, with rigid apices. The corollas have some darker purple tinted veins inside; they are 1.2 cm long with silky-lanate hairs but bases that are glabrous. The corolla tubes are about 6 mm long with the upper lip ovate in shape with entire margins; the lower lips are subpatent with the middle lobe broadly ovate in shape, lateral lobes oblong. The stamen filaments are densely villous from the base to the middle. The styles are exserted much past the corolla. There are immature nutlets without hairs, brown in color and oblong in shape.Stachys lanata in Flora of China @ efloras.orgMissouriplants.com  Cultivation  Lamb's-ear is a commonly grown plant for children's gardens, as it is easy to grow and the thick felt-like leaves are fun to touch. It is also used as an edging plant. In Brazil it is used as an edible herb, called peixinho-da-horta prepared battered and deep-fried sprinkled with lemon juice and said to taste fish-like. It has sometimes been used as a medicinal plant. A number of cultivars exist including white flowering forms, plants with shorter habit and plants that do not bloom as much: *'Big Ears' - leaves very large, up to 25 cm long. *'Cotton Boll' - a sterile cultivar that does not produce flowering stems. Asexually propagated. *'Primrose Heron' - leaves yellow in spring; flowers pink *'Sheila Macqueen' - sterile; low-growing; leaves large. *'Silky Fleece' - grows 25 cm tall with lilac-plum flowers, produce smaller white-woolly foliage.

Lamb's Ear is quite popular for a multitude of insects and Hummingbirds but in particular bees. One special type of bee known as the Wool Carder Bee collects the fuzz off of the Lamb's-Ears leaves to use for making nests in decayed wood. It has also been documented that bumble bees like to congregate in morning hours to collect water in the form of condensation that collects on the fuzz of the Lamb's-Ears leaves.

He ruled from 1820 until his death in 1835. His territory stretched from Mbhashe River, south of Mthatha to the Gamtoos River in the Southern Cape. Hintsa led the most powerful kingdom (AmaXhosa) in the Eastern Cape, which fought against white colonists for a period of 100 years over the generations. The Xhosa kingdom is made up of two houses, the Gcaleka House (Great House or the Senior House) which is the ruling house, and the Rharhabe House (Right hand house) which is the second senior house. Neighbouring kingdoms during Hintsa's time were: *AbaThembu under King Ngubengcuka, *AmaMpondo under King Faku and *AmaBhaca under King Madzikane. It is very important to note that the AmaMpondo, AbaThembu, AmaBhaca kingdoms are not Xhosa people, they are neighbours to the Xhosa Kingdom. Their kingdoms are autonomous in their own right and should not be confused with being amaXhosa or part of amaXhosa kingdom. In his reign as king he had 11 sub-chieftaincies. Hintsa was the son of Khawuta ka Gcaleka. His father was the eldest son of Gcaleka ka Phalo. His mother Nobutho is said to be a daughter of Tshatshu whose father was Xhoba and grandfather was Thukwa of Thembulan. Hintsa had four known sons, Sarili ka Hintsa (1810) from his first wife Nomsa kaGambushe Tshezi and Ncaphayi ka Hintsa, Manxiwa ka Hintsa and Lindinyura ka Hintsa from an unknown second wife. Sixth Frontier war (1834‚Äì1836) The Sixth Frontier War (1834‚Äì1836) between the Xhosa and the British is sometimes known as the Hintsa War. The war broke out when a Cape government commando party patrolled land near the Kat River which was occupied by Rharhabe chiefs Maqoma, Tyali and Botumane in December 1834. These patrols increased the bitterness that Maqoma and Tyali had after they had been forcibly removed by the Cape government from the Tyume Valley in 1833. On 21 December 1834, large force of some 10 000 RharhabeXhosas led by Maqoma, and Tyali swept into the Cape Colony, devastated the country between the Winterberg and the sea. Hintsa offered moral support to the chiefs but never sent an army to assist them. After fighting for several months, the British troops led by Sir Harry Smith and Sir Benjamin d'Urban realised that their campaign had gone on for too long and would make them unpopular with authorities in Britain. To bolster their attack, they requested Hintsa to attack the Rharhabe chiefs. In early February 1835, Hintsa offered 1000 men but as weeks went on it became clear that Hintsa was not willing to betray the Rharhabe chiefs. d'Urban used this as an excuse to declare war on Hintsa. However, Hintsa opted to talk things through with the British. On 14 April 1835 British governor Sir Benjamin d'Urban confronted King Hintsa with a large army. d'Urban insisted that Hintsa was the leader of the entire Xhosa nation and held him responsible for initial attacks on the Cape Colony, and for taking back cattle that was initially stolen from the Xhosa's. d'Urban dictated the following terms to Hintsa: That all the country from the Cape's prior frontier, the Keiskamma River, as far as the Great Kei River will fall annexed as the British \\"Queen Adelaide Province\\", and its inhabitants declared British subjects, and all the cattle initially claimed from the Xhosa's to be returned back to the British.  Death  George Southey. The Lieutenant chiefly known for shooting Xhosa King Hintsa and mutilating his body. Invited to peace talks by the governor of the Cape, Harry Smith, the British demanded 50 000 cattle in compensation for the 1834 war, and that Hintsa tell all Xhosa chiefs to stop fighting the British. Hintsa was then held captive until the terms were met. Hintsa sent word to Maqoma, his military commander, telling him to hide the cattle. On May 6, 1820 Hintsa, who was about 45, was riding as a prisoner in the company of British soldiers led by Harry Smith. Mostert tells the story  Legacy  Hintsa is considered a hero by many Xhosa people. Knowledge of his legacy is transmitted through oral history by poems and stories and he is often compared to Shaka kaSenzangakhona, king of the Zulus. In 1996 Nicholas Tilana Gcaleka, a descendant of Hintsa, claimed to have returned the 161-year-old skull of Hintsa from Scotland. He also claimed that he was the great-great nephew of Hintsa and was called on by the spirits of his ancestors to go to Scotland to find Hintsa's head. The Gcaleka Xhosa monarch, Xolilizwe Sigcawu, and his court refused to sanction the planned burial of the skull because they said it was not the disembodied head of Hintsa. The King Hintsa Bravery Award for leaders that live and act in the spirit of Hintsa kaKhawuta was established in 1999. It was awarded to Jacob Zuma in 2012. Earlier earners of the award include Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe. The award is conferred by the ruling Xhosa king. In 2014, Centane Technical College, Teko Technical College, H.B.

He was known as \\"a bold leader of new poetry\\" and writer who \\"stands out differently\\" from most other experimentalists. Biography Early life Raj Kamal was born at Rampur Haveli (a village near Muraliganj which was his mother's home) in northern Bihar. His real name was Manindra Narayan Choudhary. People used to affectionately call him Phool Babu. He was eldest son of Madhusudan Choudhary, a noted scholar of his time and a resident of Mahishi village. When Rajkamal was barely 10‚Äì12 years old, he suffered the loss of his mother, Triveni Devi, which left a deep imprint on his mind. He spent his childhood in Mahishi village of Saharsa district of northern Bihar. Later he moved to Jayanagar, Barh and Nawada along with his father and would come back to his village during summer vacations. His father Madhusudan Choudhary remarried, after death of Rajkamal's mother, with Jamuna Devi who was of similar age to Rajkamal. Arrival of step mother in his house was the beginning of a tumultuous relationship between Rajkamal and his father. Because his step mother was of similar age as Rajkamal was, he could never see her in same manner as he used to see his own mother or his earlier step mother ( Prior to Madhusudan Chaudhary's marriage to Rajkamal's mother, he had a previous marriage but did not have a child from that marriage). Being a \\"mother\\" to a man just a little younger than her, it must have been a difficult role for Jamuna Devi and a weird one too. For this marriage, Rajkamal never forgave his father. Until passing matriculation, Rajkamal was religious (as he was brought up in strict Maithil Brahmin family). He could easily recite hymns from Geeta and Durga Saptshati. His father wanted him to be an obedient son and a Brahmin with values. To inculcate these values in Rajkamal, he would use- order, preaching and beating. While preaching, his father would give him an example of a son who got burnt alive on the deck of a ship while obeying the orders of his father. Rajkamal would find such examples ridiculous and loathsome. Education Rajkamal passed his matriculation examination in 1947 from Nawada high school in Bihar. After that he moved to Patna and got himself admitted to B.N. College Patna in Bihar in Intermediate (arts) program. He lived in B.N. College hostel where he got more inclined towards literature and started reading about painting and started drawing. He was quick to make friends with strangers. Girls would be easily attracted to him. This is where he met a girl named Shobhana and fell in love with her. Shobhna's father was transferred to Bhagalpur and as a result Shobhana moved away from Patna. To be with Shobhana, he left intermediate (arts) program at B. N. College and moved to Bhagalpur and got himself enrolled in Intermediate (commerce) program at Marwari College in Bhagalpur in 1948. For many distractions that came to Rajkamal at that time, he could not successfully complete his intermediate (commerce) program at Bhagalpur and got himself enorolled at Gaya College. He finished his Intermediate (commerce) and then Bachelors in (commerce) in 1954. Career Soon after graduating from college with a B.Com, there was an intense pressure on him to get settled as he was newly married (He married first time with Shashikanta Choudhary in 1951). Sometime in 1955, he started a government job at Patna secretariat in the education department. But he never considered job as his goal of life. The job was just to make his ends meet, not more than that.He was afraid that he might turn into how others live their life which he mentioned in one of his stories in Sarika- get a degree, start a job, become a servant, get pension and pass away.It is believed that he quit ( or was perhaps dismissed) from this job in 1957 because of being absent for long duration of times (as new events were happening in his life which included his second marriage to Savitri Sharma of Mussoorie). After that he worked as a journalist,writer, poet and translator during six years of stay in Calcutta and later part of his short life. Fighting bad health, money problems and intellectual clashes inside his own mind, he wrote until his death. Personal life Rajkamal came across many women at different phases in his life. His first love was Shobhana who he met at Patna and in fact abandoned his education at B.N. College Patna just to be with her in Bhagalpur. He married his first wife Shashikanta Chaudhary of Chanpura Darbhanga in 1951 at Saurath Sabaha where all nubile youths used to congregate. Rajkamal was not ready for this marriage and agreed only after lot of persuasion from the members of his family. In 1956 he married Savitri Sharma of Mussoorie, even then he maintained his marriage relationship with his first wife. Savitri came from an affluent family but the marriage did not last even a year. During this marriage, while he was in Mussoorie, he got attracted to another woman called Santosh, who was Savitri's niece. While many women came in his life, his real love was always his first wife Shashikanta. This is reflected in his story Jeebh par booton ke nishaan- Literary contribution After graduating in commerce, he dedicated himself to his creative pursuits. His creativity came in all flavours- as a poet, as a novelist, as a story writer, as a dramatist and as a journalist to name a few. This creativity spanned in mainly three languages-Maithili, Hindi and Bengali. Though, he also wrote some poems in English. In Maithili It is believed that he first started as a poet in Maithili. It is said that he was influenced by his teacher at Nawada high school who was fond of rhyming. This is where Rajkamal first felt that he could also write poetry. His first lines (which remained unpublished) were recorded on the first page of his high school notebook. Many don't believe it to be his first work due to the maturity of thoughts, hardly suggest it to be a rookie's work. His first lines were . The very first story of Maithili Aprajita came in 1954 in Vaidehi. His first Maithili poem was published in Vaidehi titled Pataniya tattook prati in 1955. By the time he started publishing his work in Hindi regularly, he had already established as a writer of repute in Maithili in a very short span of time give to his farsighted, timeless work which vehemently attacked social taboos of Mithila (Maithili Language Speaking Area) deeply ingrained in its culture. During his lifetime, the first poetry collection that came (in the year 1958) was titled Swargandha. His next poetry collection came 14 years after his death and 23 years after publication of his first poetry collection in 1981. It was titled Kavita Rajkamalak edited my Mohan Bhardwaj.One of uniqueness of his style of poetry is that he did not follow any meter, any rhyme or any set structure in his poems. They were written in a moment and were mostly reflecting the way the life came to him. A majority of Rajkamal's work had some connection with his personal experiences. His way of looking at things clearly differentiated him from his contemporaries. One example can be seen in this poem- Original Maithili Poem ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ó‡§≤ ‡§õ‡•Ä, ‡§ï‡§§‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§§‡§≤ ‡§Ö‡§õ‡§ø ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•à ‡§π‡•ã‡§á‡§è ‡§ï‡§ø‡§õ‡•Å‡§ì ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∏‡§≤ ‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§®‡§π‡§ø ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®-‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§ö‡§æ‡§® ‡§π‡•á, ‡§Ü‡§¨‡§π, ‡§≤‡§æ‡§≤‡§ü‡•á‡§®‡§ï ‡§¨‡§¶‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§æ‡§® ‡§¶‡•à‡§π ‡§ï‡§ø‡§õ‡•Å ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø ‡§¶‡•Å‡§á‡§è ‡§™‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ñ‡§¨‡§æ ‡§≤‡•á‡§≤ ‡§Ü‡§¨ ‡§Ö‡§õ‡§ø ‡§ö‡§ø‡§†‡•ç‡§†‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§™‡•ç‡§™‡§® ‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á Hindi Translation ‡§ú‡§ó‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§®‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§ ‡§π‡•Å‡§à ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§™‡§§‡§æ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç. ‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§¶! ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§†‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Å‡§à ‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§§‡§∞‡§π ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø ‡§¶‡§æ‡§® ‡§¶‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§ö‡§ø‡§†‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§â‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á ‡§¨‡§∏ ‡§¶‡•ã ‡§™‡§Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§∂‡•á‡§∑ ‡§π‡•à English Translation Am awake. Don't know how long this night has already been. Don't sulk like my angry lover, oh moon! Come gift me some light, for a lantern, Just two lines remain in this letter to my queen In Maithili he wrote nearly 100 poems, three novels, 37 stories, three one act plays and four critical essays. The vast literature that he penned in a short 13 years of literary life, majority of his work remained unpublished till his death. Nearly ten months after his death, his friends at BIT Sindri brought the first collection of his Maithili short stories Lalka Paag. This was followed by Nirmohi Balam Hamar and Ek Anaar Ek Rogaah. In 1980 Maithili Academy published Kriti Rajkamalak which was followed by Ekta Champakali Ekta Vishdhar(edited by Taranand Viyogi) in the year 1983. The story Ekta Champakali Ekta Vishdhar attacks at the social problem of Mithila (Maithili Language Speaking Area) where women, even in today's times, are forcibly married to an unequal match. In this particular story, he shows how the mother (the Vishadhar) does not care to set up her young daughter's (the Champakali) marriage to an old man just to free herself up (due to her poor background which won't allow her pay the dowry which is another malady of that society). In Hindi Although Rajkamal wrote in Maithli for a longer duration than Hindi, he was able to write much more in Hindi . According to his wife Shashikanta Chaudhary, the time after 1960 was very suitable for his creative pursuits as he was living a more \\"settled\\" life. Sometimes he would get so involved in reading or writing that he won't go to bed until dawn.Some believe that writing in Hindi was more profitable therefore he concentrated more towards Hindi writing. He wrote eight novels, about 250 poems, 92 stories, 55 essays, three plays and five regular columns in Hindi.Rajkamal started to write in Hindi from 1956. The first poem that was published was titled Barsaat:Raat:Prabhaat. His work in Hindi was very different from Maithili in many ways. These differed in the setup, the problems enquired and the class addressed. One common thread to his Maithili and Hindi writings was women. Like in Maithili, he used women to portray the socio-economic problems of life. Most of his time of his creative Hindi writing was spent in Calcutta which has featured in many of his stories. Its really amazing that just by reading western life, he was very able to portray the life in New York as detailed in his novel Machhali Mari Hui. He expressed his \\"open\\" ideas in a time when India still was deeply rooted to its tradition. Subjects like Sex were not out of bedroom. A person's life was judged how \\"good\\" of man/woman he/she was as those who took sex as a biological outcome were not looked highly. In a way, such attempts were also a cover up of social maladies some believed that not discussing them would mean they do not exist. Rajkamal, believed that many of such problems have come because of atrocities that our very own society has made. For example a sixteen-year young women married to a sixty-two-year-old man will never have her sexual desires fulfilled. The society that she lives does not allow her to express her (her biological expressions) by keeping her in closed doors, by keeping her always under the nose of her husband and by branding her as prostitute even she mixes up freely with a member of an opposite sex. Therefore, she ends up in \\"illegitimate\\" relationship, \\"illegitimate\\" acts, incest but nobody looks at the root cause of these problems. Even in an urban setting, he saw pretty much the same thing but not the form of oppression but extreme freedom. The problems that richness brings. Machhali Mari Hui is considered as one of his finest novels in Hindi. He has described homosexual (lesbian) relations in this book which is probably the first Hindi work touching this subject and one of the earliest works in this area. A vast majority of his unpublished and published work in Hindi has been compiled and published by Deoshankar Navin who has worked tirelessly to bring the writings of Rajkamal Chaudhary in the book form to its readers over the years. Other work While in Calcutta (now Kolkata) he came in touch with the Hungryalists, known also as \\"Bhukhi Peerhi\\", and contributed to their bulletins. He was in close contact with Patna-based Malay Roy Choudhury, Subimal Basak and Samir Roychoudhury of the \\"Bhukhi Peerhi\\" movement.

Arriving in Sydney from England in 1842, at a time when the city was rapidly expanding and new suburbs and towns were being established, Blacket was to become a pioneer of the revival styles of architecture, in particular Victorian Gothic. He was the most favoured architect of the Church of England in New South Wales for much of his career, and between late 1849 and 1854 was the official \\"Colonial Architect to New South Wales\\". While Blacket is famous for his churches, and is sometimes referred to as \\"The Wren of Sydney\\", he also built houses, ranging from small cottages to multi-storey terraces and large mansions; government buildings; bridges; and business premises of all sorts. Blacket's architectural practice was highly influential in the development of Australian architecture. He worked with a number of other architects of both Australian and international importance: James Barnet, William Wardell and John Horbury Hunt. Among his children, Arthur, Owen and Cyril followed him into the profession. The successful architect William Kemp also trained in his practice. Edmund Blacket is regarded by descendants of the Blackett family as \\"a man of the strictest probity with a great love for his profession, who also studied the classics, and was considered the leading authority on Classical Greek in Sydney, loved music, playing the organ at the temporary wooden pro- Cathedral, was a competent wood-carver and an amateur mechanical engineer\\".Blackett family oral history, letters and records Early life Sydney University seen from Parramatta road in the 1870s.

The family were Nonconformists, and Edmund's grandfather Edward Ralph, a former clockmaker, had been minister of a Congregational church at Maidstone. Blacket was educated at Mill Hill School, near Barnet, and although he showed an early interest in architecture, spending his holidays sketching and measuring old buildings, his father opposed him taking up the profession. On leaving school, Blacket went to work in his father's office and three years later, at the age of 20, took a position in a linen mill in Stokesley, Yorkshire. This mill was owned by his father in partnership with a Thomas Mease and operated by Edmund's brothers John and James. However, the Blackets ended the partnership with Mease in July 1837 as they were unhappy about certain financial matters, and by March 1838, the issue was in Chancery.John Walker Ord, History & Antiquities of Cleveland, (1846). In about 1837, although lacking formal training, Blacket began work for the Stockton and Darlington Railway as a surveyor. This was the period of rapid expansion of the railways and in railway engineering and innovation. As a railway surveyor one of Blacket's jobs would have been the design of railway stations. He continued in Yorkshire until 1841, taking every possible opportunity to draw ancient buildings and their details, which included spending his 23rd birthday surveying Whitby Abbey. In June 1841, Blacket was at the family home on Brixton Hill, when his father entered him on the census returns as \\"Draper\\". During the same year, he worked for the Archbishop of Canterbury in London as Inspector of Schools, and at that time learnt the craft of making stained glass He spent the year \\"in misery\\", being in love with Sarah Mease, the daughter of his father's former business partner. Their marriage was opposed by the families, and having been in love probably from 1837 or earlier, they were finally wed on 27 April 1842 in the medieval parish church of Wakefield, (which later became Wakefield Cathedral) with neither set of parents present. Blacket's diaries indicate that he had become a member of the Church of England and had a great love for the Anglican Liturgy. His brother Henry Blackett became a high church Anglican clergyman. Francis Greenway's spire of St James' Church was Sydney Town's landmark. I.G. Austin, 1836 On 13 June 1842, Blacket and his new wife left England on the passenger vessel Eden, bound for Sydney, but with New Zealand as their intended final destination. Blacket later wrote, \\"Neither my Father or Mother would bid me good bye, so my old Uncle offered to see us off.\\"Edmund Blacket, Letter, (1859) Blackett family Archives. He had letters of introduction to prominent residents of Sydney, including Sir Charles Nicholson, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort and a recommendation to Bishop William Grant Broughton from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Blacket suffered from sea-sickness for the first month, although Sarah did not. After about 55 days the ship called at Bahia in Brazil, where he made sketches of church doors and other items that interested him. He also acquired a marmoset monkey which disturbed his sketching for the rest of the voyage. He spent the rest of the voyage carving a wooden crucifix. The Eden sailed into Sydney Harbour on 4 November 1842 with Blacket, who kept a shipboard diary, writing that he had never seen such \\"an exquisite scene\\". The Blackets were also greatly impressed by the crew of MƒÅori oarsmen in the pilot boat. The first building that Blacket saw in Sydney Town was the simple copper-clad steeple of Francis Greenway's St. James's Church. He went ashore and found lodgings opposite the little Methodist Chapel with its Doric portico in Princes Street. Sarah wrote home that \\"almost everyone keeps a carriage\\" and that Sydney Town had just achieved the status of a city, the first mayor having been elected. Blacket was a prepossessing young man, handsome, well- mannered, elegantly dressed and with ¬£600 in capital. He soon found suitable employment and the Blackets relinquished their plans to travel on to New Zealand. Family relationships Blacket was an enthusiastic writer, leaving a shipboard journal in the form of an ordinary school exercise book and sending many letters to his family in England, and to his children, particularly his youngest daughter Hilda, to whom he once sent thirty stamps, as an encouragement to write back. In 1849 Blacket assisted his cousin Thomas Blacket Stephens in his immigration to Sydney. Thomas went on to be a prominent citizen and politician of Brisbane, Queensland. Blacket's brother Russell, who joined him in Australia in 1858, ran a school in Wollongong and was the father of Wilfred Blacket, barrister. All his other brothers and sisters remained in England, and their descendants include his great nephews Patrick, Lord Blackett and Basil Phillott Blackett. The breach with his parents and in-laws apparently healed. After his father's death in 1858 he wrote to his mother-in-law that \\"there has never been an instance in which I have failed to receive a letter from him, and in addition he has regularly directed and posted to me the Illustrated London News and Punch.\\" The first edition of the former paper was published shortly before he left England, and would have kept him informed of architectural developments in England. Architectural influences and development In England, towards the end the 18th century, architecture was dominated by the simple symmetrical Classical forms of Georgian architecture. This style was transported to Sydney along with the first English settlers and the accompanying military regiments. However, among England's elite there was a growing taste for the picturesque Gothic style. This too was introduced to Australia, and Sydney's convict architect, Francis Greenway, employed it in the construction of the Government Stables with battlements and towers. hammer-beam roof at St Andrew's Cathedral were advocated by Augustus Welby Pugin. Changes within the Church of England and an academic interest in the historic styles promoted the formation of the Oxford Architectural Society and the Cambridge Camden Society which, though differing in their philosophies, both promoted the medieval styles‚ÄîGothic in particular‚Äîas being those suitable for church architecture and its correct liturgical function. The purpose of the architect was seen as being to create designs of such archaeological correctness that they reproduced the styles of ecclesiastical architecture prior to the Reformation, as is demonstrated in the work of the renowned Augustus Welby Pugin. On his arrival in Sydney, Blacket possessed a small library of architectural books, and he kept abreast of the latest trends by subscribing to journals. Although there were a number of buildings with Gothic details in the colony at the time, in particular the existing south transept of the new cathedral, these structures had strongly Classical elements beneath their medieval detailing. Blacket was the first architect in Australia who truly understood the principles of the Gothic style and who could design a church that would satisfy the august societies of Oxford and Cambridge. Since it was the wish of so many colonials, not the least of whom was the Bishop, to assuage their homesickness by at least attending a church that reminded them of one in Cornwall, Yorkshire or East Anglia, Edmund Blacket was to become a very popular man. Although probably at his best when designing in the Medieval ecclesiastic styles and the Florentine palazzo style which he employed for commercial premises, Blacket followed the trends of Victorian architecture in London through his subscription and library membership. Some of his later churches, particularly those in brick, were to have a robust quality, often with Early French Gothic rose windows with plate tracery or a simple quatrefoil. Blacket quickly adopted the colonial Georgian form of domestic architecture, to which he then applied a variety of details. He was also introduced to the architectural trends in both North America and Scotland by John Horbury Hunt and James Barnet respectively. From the 1870s his commercial and domestic buildings began to acquire eclectic details and incised ornament. \\"Architect and Surveyor\\" The early 1840s were a time of economic depression in New South Wales brought on by a severe drought in 1839, so Blacket was very fortunate to immediately gain employment from Bishop Broughton as Inspector of the Schools in connection with the Church of England in the Colony. This position involved the design and supervision of the building of schools, churches and parsonages. As the colony rapidly expanded, many school buildings were designed to be multi-purpose, serving as churches on Sunday and sometimes as court houses. Blacket began work on 1 January 1843, and on 18 January delivered to the Bishop the plans for the church of All Saint's, Patrick Plains (now Singleton). He estimated that it could be built for ¬£700. It was eventually completed in 1850 for ¬£713.11s.6d. Other churches that he supervised, designed or extended were St John's Ashfield (1843), St Mary's Balmain (1843), St Paul's Carcoar (1845), the old St Stephen's, Newtown (1845) and Christ Church St Laurence, Sydney. In May 1843, he put up a brass plaque on his door, advertising himself as \\"Architect and Surveyor\\" and writing to his brother Frank in London: \\"There is nothing to be gained here by hiding ones talent in a bushel.\\" In the same letter he wrote of his aim to \\"improve the taste of the discerning public upon ecclesiastical architecture\\". In July of the same year, he began this by giving his first lecture, on Norman architecture, presumably at the Sydney School of Arts. Towards the end of the year, he and Sarah rented a house from Dr Hammett in Stanley Street, off College Street, where he was soon to receive an important architectural commission. Their first child, Edith, was born at Stanley Street the following year. Christ Church St Laurence was designed by Henry Robertson in 1840. From 1843, Blacket undertook the completion of the interior and then in the 1850s he built the tower and spire. This was to become a highly significant project for Blacket. The Church of England in Sydney had been founded in 1788 by the first Anglican priest in the colony, Richard Johnson. This foundation came at a time of austerity within the Church of England, predating the Oxford Movement. The first churches in Australia, such as St James', King Street, were essentially \\"preaching boxes\\" in which the pulpit was placed centrally against one of the long walls and surrounded by tiered seating of box pews, each designated for a family. Blacket was instrumental in introducing to Christ Church St Laurence all the elaborate High Church details in the style of the great Catholic architect, Augustus Welby Pugin. Sydney Evangelicals were shocked at the furnishing, the liturgy and the robed male choir, seeing it as \\"scandalous\\", and \\"papist\\". Later, Blacket was to be one of the architects to transform Greenway's St James in keeping with a High Church mode of worship (as it remains today). The Reverend WH Walsh at Christ Church St. Laurence enthusiastically helped Blacket to gain other important commissions. Blacket also had a private practice during this time, one of the most notable of his commercial commissions being the Kent Brewery for Henry Tooth. From 1843 onwards he also began receiving commissions for private houses. Early English Gothic style. Diocesan Architect St Paul's, St Mark's and St Philip's In 1847 Blacket was officially appointed Diocesan Architect for the Church of England, while still continuing with his private practice. The designs of three of Blacket's most significant churches date from 1847-48. These are St. Paul's, Redfern, St. Mark's, Darling Point and St. Philip's, Church Hill. As Joan Kerr points out, Blacket has used these three buildings as essays on the three main periods of English Gothic architecture: Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular, his motive being perhaps to impress Sydney with his scholarship. Of these three buildings, St. Paul's is the most derivative of other Victorian models, the arrangement of triple aisles of almost equal height, each with an open timber roof is repeated many times in the work of Pugin and his followers. However, the window traceries, which are of the most complex of the three English styles and for which drawings still exist, display Blacket's mastery of Gothic design. For St Mark's, Darling Point, Blacket showed the committee a design based upon an engraving of the church at Horncastle, Lincolnshire. Unlike St. Paul's, St Mark's has a high nave lit by small clerestory windows with trefoil lights above the aisles. The building work was interrupted in 1851 by the departure of men for the Australian gold rushes. The spire, which is a feature of the leafy streetscape of Darling Point Road, was chosen from 14 different versions prepared by the architect, and was paid for privately. The tower of St Philip's Church, Sydney, (1848-58), was inspired by that of the Bishop's alma mater, Madgdalen College, Oxford. At St Philip's, Church Hill, Blacket was to replace the church built by Governors Hunter and Bligh and justifiably known as \\"the ugliest church in Christendom\\". Bishop Broughton, both here and at St Paul's, wanted the design based on his beloved Magdalen Tower at Oxford. But although Blacket used the paired windows at St Philip's, the design was not a replica. Blacket was masterly at designing in the Perpendicular style and, as with other designs (such as the spire of St Mark's), he produced alternative versions which he slotted into place on the drawing or glued on as flaps, so that the Parish Council could choose. In this case they selected a design with double the usual number of windows in the clerestory level, and also two large windows in the southern side of the chancel as well as the six- light window in the eastern end, so this church, in contrast to St Paul's, Redfern, is unusually light. Unlike the Decorated Gothic tracery at St Paul's, the Perpendicular Gothic tracery is repetitious in its form. The visual effect of the church is one of harmony and elegance of proportion. Because of the Evangelical nature of this church, there is no figurative decoration, but the east window by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars, \\"variegated with flowers and interspersed with texts\\", cost ¬£200 and is one of the finest non-pictorial windows in Sydney. St. Andrew's Cathedral 1837-68, is a very tall building for its width, appearing a cathedral rather than a large parish church. St. Andrew's Cathedral Blacket's association with St Andrew's, the Anglican Cathedral of Sydney, began in 1846. Grand plans for a square church had been made by Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his architect Francis Greenway, but these had been abandoned after proceeding no further than the laying of the foundation stone in 1819. By the time of Blacket's arrival, St Andrew's was under construction to a design by James Hume. It was to be a Neo Gothic structure of a relatively timid design and scale, cruciform and with narrow transepts. The foundations were laid, the south transept was almost complete, and in places the walls were high. The work had ceased through lack of funds owing to the drought. In 1846 Blacket, who was seen by the committee to have a greater grasp of architectural principles and design than Hume, was appointed to replace him as architect of the cathedral. While the cathedral was under construction, a temporary wooden cathedral was erected, and one of Blacket's first jobs was to create a stained-glass window for it. Being unable to acquire coloured glass, he painted plain glass and fired it, using part of the crypt beneath St James, King Street, as his studio. This window, which predated commercial stained glass manufacture in Australia, has unfortunately been lost. Blacket was very pleased with it and wrote to his brother Frank \\"the folk who come to see it ... can hardly believe it is not stained glass.\\" Blacket's design for the cathedral was restricted by the foundations that were already in place and the existence of Perpendicular tracery built to Hume's design in two of the aisle windows. The challenge to Blacket was to create a building which worked within the limitations of scale but still had the imposing quality of a cathedral. Once again, Bishop Broughton's aim was to have a replica of the Magdalen College tower, but Bishop Selwyn of New Zealand had laid the foundation stone in 1842, and his recommendation had been for two towers. Blacket initially designed towers that accommodated the wishes of both Bishops, but he also wrote to a relative in Yorkshire asking them to send drawings of the fa√ßade of York Minster. The towers of St. Andrew's Cathedral have been inspired by those of York Minster. By 1847, all of Blacket's proposed changes, including the elaborate fa√ßade and lengthening of the nave had been accepted. In order to make sure that his design was truly the best possible solution, he sent copies of his plans to England, to both the Oxford Society and the Cambridge Camden Society for comment. His design was acceptable to both, the Oxford Society in particular waxed lyrical, saying that his design \\"had realised the idea of a cathedral, as diverse from a parish church\\". However, Oxford wanted the roof of the aisles to be of steeper pitch, and a decorative moulding (or string course) around the interior walls, while Cambridge wanted more pinnacles and just one large window in the transept ends. Blacket obliged by making such changes as he could, but the string course and the rebuilding of the paired windows in the existent transept were impractical. Blacket had the model-maker J.C. White construct a detailed cardboard model of a scale 1 inch to 8 feet. This pleased the committee and the cathedral was finished much as demonstrated on the model, but with one very significant change: the west front, while retaining its form, had it details redesigned, in the light of the drawings that he received from Yorkshire. Blacket's modification of the west front is to a much richer and more vertical design. This was achieved by the adoption of several features of the famous fa√ßade of York Minster, including abandoning the paired \\"Magdalen College\\" windows in the uppermost stage in favour of large mullioned windows framed by a flamboyant arch rising to the level of the ornate parapet. The nave is like those of 15th-century churches in Suffolk.These are more strongly modelled than at York, and meet the obliquely set pinnacle above them in a continuous upward-sweeping movement. Another such flamboyant moulding rises from the tall central window to overlap the gable in a manner both complex and inventive. The interior, despite its small scale, and the large size of the piers, has a lofty, spacious and elegant appearance. It was furnished with richly carved furniture designed by Blacket himself and a cycle of 27 windows by John Hardman & Co. of Birmingham depicting the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The cathedral was opened and consecrated on 30 November 1868 by Broughton's successor, Bishop Frederic Barker. Joseph Kinsela writes, \\"Such is Blacket's grasp of English Late Gothic style that the interior could be taken for the product of the fifteenth century. There are no Victorian clich√©s.... Not many Australians are aware of the architectural status of St. Andrew's Cathedral...[it] is the equal of the best 19th century work in this style.\\" However, not everyone was enthusiastic at the time, one critic writing, \\"We are compelled to say that seldom has so dull an inanity been produced at so great a cost.\\" Colonial Architect On 1 December 1849, while the construction of St Andrew's Cathedral was proceeding, Blacket was appointed Colonial Architect for New South Wales, succeeding Mortimer Lewis. He occupied this position for nearly five years, but there are few buildings remaining in Sydney from this employment with the exception of the small Water Police Office in a robust Classical style. His largest job was the Glebe Island Abattoirs and the Moreton Island Lighthouse was also a significant undertaking. He spent much of his time in the country, supervising the building of wooden bridges, some of which have survived. When in Sydney, he was called out frequently to look at the leaking roof of Government House, but roof drainage was not one of Blacket's talents. In 1851, gold was discovered, both in New South Wales and in Victoria. While trade and commerce thrived, the building industry lost its workforce. While work on many of the ecclesiastical buildings that Blacket had designed and continued to supervise came to a standstill, the Government had a sudden requirement for coach houses, escort stations and lockups, as well as a design for a secure coach to transport gold. Designs for all these were provided by the Colonial Architect, probably closely following plans sent from England. In 1853, the Blacket family moved to a rented house in Glebe. It was a wild place at that time and Sarah feared for Edmund's safety as he walked home. The family had expanded to six children: Edith, was born in 1844, Alice in 1846, Arthur in 1848, Marian in 1850, Owen in 1851 and Hilda in 1854. The cost of living greatly increased owing to the gold rush and with six children to support and earning ¬£300 a year, Blacket left the Public Service in September 1854, to be succeeded by William Weaver. University of Sydney Blacket was involved with the foundation of Sydney University from the outset, and played a role in selecting the site on the Parramatta Road at the top of a rise overlooking Grose Farm (now Victoria Park). He was appointed University Architect on 23 May 1854, several days before he resigned as Colonial Architect, and he continued to supervise building for the Government for some months. Main Building, University of Sydney One of his first tasks as University Architect was to persuade the august committee to accept the notion that Perpendicular Gothic really was the only right and appropriate style for the building, because of its association with most colleges of both Oxford and Cambridge. The notes that he made for this speech are still in existence. Blacket was able to show the committee the sort of building that he intended, having to hand J. T. Emmett's design of the Congregational College on Finchley Road, north of London.This appears in Blacket's own copy of The Builder, 13 December 1851 Blacket asked his friend, the artist Conrad Martens, to create a watercolour drawing from his plans and elevations. Although the plans can not be located, the drawing is owned by the University and was engraved to appear in a newspaper. The building is in the Perpendicular Gothic style with a front of broken at the centre by a tower of , beneath which there is a lofty archway, and surmounted by large pinnacles. The fa√ßade is broken by two gabled bays to the left, and one to the right, the right side of the building terminating in the Great Hall. While the whole exterior of the building, with its glowing sandstone, battlemented roofline and array of glinting leadlight windows give an imposing effect on top of the hill, it is the Great Hall that is regarded as the finest part of the design. The interior is loosely based on that of the Great Hall of Westminster, having a magnificent hammer-beam roof and a large mullioned and transommed window at each end. The windows of the long sides are placed high above an ornamented course in order that portraits may be hung beneath them, except at the south western corner where there is a large oriel window. The building has many rich details including the angels, which are carved on every hammer beam. The glass, by the English firm Clayton and Bell, represents men of learning, and is said to be the oldest complete cycle of Victorian stained glass. The Senate is said to have asked Blacket to sign his buildings; the Blacket coat of arms are on a chimney on the south wall of the main wing, and his initials, ETB, are on the fa√ßade of the Great Hall. \\"Bidura\\", Blacket's home in Glebe Completed in 1861, the university soon became a tourist attraction; Anthony Trollope wrote home in 1874 that the Hall was \\"the finest chamber in the colonies\\", and that he could remember no college of Oxford or Cambridge which possessed a hall \\"of which the proportions are so good\\". J. M. Freeland says of the architectural scene in Sydney in the 1860s, \\"The real architects of Sydney, in general, liked, respected and helped each other as friends. This peaceful situation was partly due to the overpowering presence of Edmund Blacket. Blacket bestrode the Sydney Architectural scene like a colossus.\\" During the period of the building of Sydney University, Edmund and Sarah added another two children to the family; Cyril was born in 1857 and Horace in 1860, taking the total to eight. In 1857, Edmund designed and built a home for his family, \\"Bidura\\", on Glebe Point Road. Nearby was \\"Toxteth Park\\", home of the solicitor, George Allen, a grand house built by the Regency architect, John Verge. The presence of this house seems to have influenced Blacket's design as the house he built for himself is entirely of a Colonial Regency style, with a hip roof and French doors opening onto a veranda with open cast-iron pilasters. In 1859, Blacket received his last letter from his father, who died in November 1858. Other buildings Schools and institutions At the University of Sydney, Blacket built the Anglican St. Paul's College and supervised the building of the Catholic College of St John's after the resignation of its designer William Wardell. Insofar as the building was completed, he was faithful to Wardell's design, but he omitted several features, such as the western cloister, for lack of funds. In 1881, Blacket designed the Clarke Buildings of Trinity College, a residential college affiliated with the University of Melbourne. These residential buildings were executed in brick, with decorative stone features and carved columns. He later also added a kitchen and staff accommodation block. A design for a chapel at the College was not proceeded with. The Clarke Buildings were extended and completed and Arthur Blacket in 1888. One of Blacket's best known commissions was the extension of Sydney Grammar School in 1855. The building, occupying a highly visible position fronting onto College Street and overlooking Hyde Park in the City of Sydney, was begun by Edward Hallen in 1832, to a Regency design, but considerably smaller than intended. Because of the structure of the school board, Blacket's plans for the extension had to go before the Legislative Council for approval. He added a wing to either end of the building, respecting the proportion of the original, but with two floors where the earlier stage had one, and with the centre of Hallen's building having a Doric portico. The portico was not constructed until 157 years later, and in the intervening period, the design looked strangely vacant in the middle. Blacket also designed the Avoca Street front of the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick, Mudgee Hospital and the ornate Blind Asylum on the corner of William Street. Banks and commercial premises Many of Blacket's banks date from the 1850s and 60s, as do many of his houses. Whereas churches and associated buildings were generally of the Gothic and occasionally of the Romanesque style, the Classical style was more usual for banks, many of them stylistically based upon the palaces of Renaissance Florence. These included The Bank of Australasia and The English, Scottish and Australian Bank, both on George Street, The Exchange Buildings on Spring and Gresham Streets and The Liverpool and London Insurance Company on Margaret Street. Of the banks and offices that Blacket designed within the Sydney CBD, several survived into the 1970s but were eventually demolished to make way for high-rise development. One bank's neoclassical exterior survives on the corner of George and King Street, but the interior was gutted in 2011 to accommodate Louis Vuitton's flagship Sydney store. As late as 2008, when it housed the Blacket hotel, a few internal fittings ‚Äì a staircase, and the bank vault among others ‚Äì remained. Many of his small shops and commercial premises exist in other parts of Sydney such as Redfern and King Street, Newtown, but invariably with the street level fa√ßade altered beyond recognition. Other commercial buildings included Mort's Wool Stores at Circular Quay, which are now demolished, and David Cohen's & Co general store in High St Maitland, which was originally three stories but only the ground floor, occupied by Centrelink, is now remaining after a fire in 1970. Houses \\"Greenoaks\\" (now \\"Bishopscourt\\"), Darling Point, built for Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, (1840s-60) Blacket built houses both great and small. They ranged from a little five-room house for E. O. Heywood on Glebe Point Road to Henry Cary Dangar's castle-like Grantham, formerly on Pott's Point. With its battlements, turrets, grand staircase and magnificent harbour views, Grantham rivalled Government House. Joan Kerr writes, \\"It was one of the grandest houses in Australia and certainly the grandest of this baronial Gothic type. Its demolition was an appalling loss....\\" Henry Gilbert Smith, the founder of , was a favourite client whilst Blacket was in private practice, having designed his Georgian house, Fairlight House, two versions of the Style Hotel (both since demolished), and St Matthew's Church (also demolished), all in the Manly area. Blacket also built several Anglican Church rectories, most of which are in a simple, asymmetrical, Gothic Revival style with gables and some Gothic detailing in the bargeboards and verandas, such as those at Berrima and Bega. He also remodelled Thomas Sutcliffe Mort's house Greenoaks in the Gothic style‚Äîit was since renamed Bishopscourt as the residence of the Archbishop of Sydney until its sale to private interests. A common residential commission late in the practice was for rows of terraces. As three of his four sons, Arthur, Owen and Cyril, joined him, terraces became a major occupation for \\"Blacket and Sons\\". A row with decidedly eccentric aesthetic details, for which Cyril was almost certainly responsible, exists in Petersham, and is similar to those designed for W. H. Paling in 1881. Churches As an architect, Blacket is most famous for his churches. The exact number that he designed is unknown but totals more than a hundred, earning him the epithet, \\"The Wren of Sydney\\". His little country churches, in golden sandstone where available, with their steep gables and small bellcotes are so familiar in New South Wales, and established such a strong tradition to be imitated in stone, weatherboard and brick, that they are often seen as so commonplace as to be unremarkable. Blacket's churches range from small multi-purpose school-cum- churches to cathedrals. Several of his finest churches are among the most highly valued heritage buildings in Australia. Small churches Blacket's small churches, such as St Peter's, Watsons Bay, (1864) are numerous and provided the model for later Australian churches, in stone, brick and weatherboard. While the general outline of these buildings, with steeply pitched roofs, lower chancels and small bellcotes are easily recognisable, the form varies from tiny buildings like St Mark's Greendale, (1848) to the somewhat larger cruciform St Michael's, Wollongong, (1858). Even at a church as remote as St Mark's, which was surrounded by fields and forest, and had neither village nor full-time priest, the details of the design commanded Blacket's care, the little building having an elegant gable over its fluted doorway, and floral bosses, long since destroyed, at the ends of its drip moulding. Blacket's small church designs varied in style from Norman at St Silas, Waterloo; to staid Early English Gothic as at St Peter's, Watson's Bay (1864) and St Thomas's, Narellan (1880); to Perpendicular at Holy Trinity, Berrima, (1847) a comparatively wide church spanned by a hammerbeam roof of unusual design. Larger churches All Saints Church, Woollahra, (1874-82) is Blacket's most ornate design. Many of his larger churches are among Blacket's best known buildings. The designs are extremely varied; Blacket could work in any of the medieval styles, and built larger churches in all of them, while the forms of the buildings range from the aisleless hall of St Mary's, Waverley; to the aisleless cruciform church of St Paul's, Burwood; to the triple-gabled church of St Paul's, Redfern, the aisled church of St Michael's, Surry Hills and the clerestoried church of St Stephen's, Newtown. St. John the Evangelist, Glebe, 1868, is Blacket's most famous design in the Norman style, in which rich mouldings and carved capitals form a striking contrast with the plain round arches. Blacket also designed the major furnishings. St. Thomas', North Sydney (1877‚Äì84), is a cathedral-sized building in the Early English style, it is of very robust external appearance, being of rusticated masonry and internally, very spacious. Designed by Blacket near the end of his career, it was built by his sons and grandson who provided the designs for much of the furnishings. Like a number of his later works, it has a rose window of an early French Gothic type. The spire was never completed. All Saints Church, Bodalla, was designed to commemorate the life of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, 'father of Australian dairying', and was built between 1880 and 1901 from granite quarried on Mort's estate. While a Blacket design, it is unlikely that he ever saw the site or the church which was overseen by his son Cyril. However, it also features hand-wrought iron hinges and straps said to have been designed by Blacket himself.\\"History of All Saints Church, Bodalla\\"; church pamphlet St Michael's Anglican Church in Surry Hills was first designed in 1854, but Blacket modified and reduced it, as required, to cut costs. The church plan accepted in 1882 is rare among Blacket's designs in having simple Geometric Gothic tracery in its windows rather than the Flowing Decorated style of which he was a master. All Saint's, Woollahra, on the other hand, presents Late Geometric Gothic at its most opulent and ornamental. Flowing Decorated Gothic. Blacket's preferred style for a medium-to-large church was Flowing Decorated Gothic. Unlike the other historic periods of Gothic architecture, this style permitted him to vary the design of the tracery from window to window. This was far more time-consuming and costly than designing in the Early English or even the Perpendicular style, but it gave free rein to Blacket's creativity and skills as a draughtsman. During his time spent in Yorkshire during his youth, Blacket would have become familiar with two of the most famous of all Flowing Decorated windows in England, the west window of York Minster and the east window of Selby Abbey. The influence of these designs, and that of the equally famous east window of Carlisle Cathedral, can be seen in Blacket's east windows at Goulburn Cathedral; St Stephen's, Newtown; and St Paul's Burwood. Cathedrals Edmund Blacket was to design four cathedrals for the Church of England, All Saint's, Bathurst, 1845; St. Andrew's, Sydney, (appointed architect 1846); St. Saviour's, Goulburn, 1874; and St. George's, Perth, 1878. All Saint's Cathedral, Bathurst, was a simple, lofty Norman design in the attractive local red brick of all Bathurst's older buildings. It was greatly enlarged in the late 19th century, and then mostly demolished and replaced because of subsidence. St Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn, (1874), was intended to have a tall and decorative spire. St. George's Cathedral, Perth, is also of brick, and the details are of a simple Early English design. Blacket designed a single tower and spire, asymmetrically-placed and of majestic proportions. When a tower was eventually built, it was not of Blacket's design. Joan Kerr indicates that St. Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn was one of Blacket's favourite buildings, as, unlike his cathedrals in Sydney and Perth, he was not hampered either by distance, or a previous architect's foundations. It was here that Blacket was able to really indulge a love of Flowing Decorated ornamentation. There are three very large windows, of seven and six lights in the chancel and transept ends, each with highly elaborate and distinct tracery, inspired by, but not identical to, famous Medieval windows. That in the North transept has a wheel based on the Visconti emblem of a window in Milan Cathedral, but by the judicious placement of two small tracery lights, Blacket has turned it into a sunflower, an emblem frequently used by one of the stained glass firms he employed, Lyon and Cottier. Other decorative features include the foliate carving of the capitals, much of it in the stiff- leaf style of Wells Cathedral; pierced cinquefoil openings in panels above the hammerbeams; and a screen of white New Zealand stone. The stained glass includes windows by two of England's major firms: John Hardman & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and Sydney's two leading firms: Lyon and Cottier and Ashwin and Falconer. Goulburn occupied much of the last nine years of Blacket's life, and ultimately, his family donated the crucifix which he had carved on his voyage to Sydney. At St. Saviour's, as at St. Georges, Blacket's tower and the ornate crocketed spire was not built in his lifetime. The tower, without the spire and pinnacles, was completed in the late 20th century. Spires The spire of St. John's, Darlinghurst The most visible signs of Blacket's career are the spires that he positioned on hilltops around Sydney and in several country towns. Unfortunately, among those proposed but never realised are the spires of three of Blacket's grandest churches, Goulburn Cathedral, St Thomas's, North Sydney and All Saints, Woollahra. Among those that were completed, two are outstanding, those of St John's Anglican Church, Darlinghurst and St Stephen's, Newtown. As with the design of any spire, the architect faces the challenge of placing a structure of octagonal plan upon one of square plan and both structurally and visually bridging the difference. In both examples Blacket makes it \\"difficult to determine where the tower ends and the spire begins\\". At St Stephen's (1871), the tower has an accompanying stair turret that rises to the level below the tall upper belfry window. At that level, both the tower and the top of the turret are encircled by a battlement, as if the tower itself might well end there, as it does at St Paul's, Redfern. But it does not; it rises, somewhat narrower, and visually reduced by the clever play of overlapping forms. Each of the tall windows on the four sides is set into a slightly projecting plane, with its own gable, very similar in form to that which Blacket often used around doors. These rise like dormers between the broaches, overlapping the meeting of the spire and the tower, so the horizontal definition between the two occurs only at the corners. Unfortunately, in the 1990s the large poppyhead on the top of the spire became unsafe and was removed which has lessened the visual impact. At St John's the design is even more complex, because, near the top of the upper window, the tower itself suddenly appears to become octagonal in horizontal section, before the spire is reached. The change to the section is masked by the presence of four large pinnacles which rise from the corners at this point, as if they were sitting on the buttresses but are in line with the tower itself. Behind the pinnacles, once again Blacket has placed an encircling battlement which appears to mark the point where the tower ceases to be tower and becomes spire, or vice versa. Harmonious with the four crocketed pinnacles, and on the same level, are little dormer windows. Morton Herman writes of the spire of St Mark's, Darling Point, that it is a conspicuous landmark for miles around, \\"contrasting...yet part of the silhouette of the hill, amply demonstrating Blacket's ability to make buildings seem inevitable on their sites.\\" Herman says of the Sydney landscape that \\"had St Mary's, Waverley, and All Saint's, Woollahra, gained their intended spires the main heights of the whole district would have culminated in Blacket spires and provided impressive sights from all points of view\\". Later life The tombstone that Blacket designed for Sarah, relocated from Balmain to Camperdown Cemetery Blacket's home in Balmain, Sydney On 15 September 1869, Sarah Blacket died, aged 51 years. Cyril and Horace were at this time only 12 and 9 respectively. Marion, the third daughter, was 19. She was to remain unmarried and in her father's household, caring for her four young siblings. Sarah's body was buried in Balmain Cemetery with a simple headstone of a gabled Gothic form. According to Morton Herman, Blacket had \\"always consulted her about every important matter, before he ever gave a final decision, for as long as she lived\\". A year after Sarah's death, Blacket sold \\"Bidura\\" and moved to Balmain, living for a time in a house owned by his brother Russell. He was to remain in Balmain until about 1880, despite the fact that it was a notorious place with its own force of six police necessary to keep order. In his last few years he lived in \\"Roland Villa\\", Petersham, near the home of his son Cyril and his wife. Death The memorial hatchment to Edmund Blacket in St. Andrew's Cathedral Edmund Blacket died suddenly from \\"apoplexy\\" on Friday 9 February 1883 aged 65 at his home \\"Roland Villa\\", Croydon Street, Petersham, Sydney. The daily papers, as far away as Perth, where St. George's Cathedral was under construction, carried obituaries praising him and citing Sydney University as \\"probably the finest structure in the Australian Colonies\\". His funeral on Saturday 10 February 1883 was well attended and the coffin bearers included three of Australia's most distinguished architects: William Kemp, John Horbury Hunt, and the Colonial Architect, James Barnet. Blacket was buried with his wife in Balmain Cemetery, and his name was added to the tombstone that he had designed for her, but at the closure of Balmain Cemetery in 1942, their ashes were removed to St. Andrew's Cathedral, where an enamel hatchment and a small brass plaque mark the place of their interment. Their memorial stone was relocated to Camperdown Cemetery. Personally, Blacket was held in high esteem, those who knew him recalling his good qualities for later historians; H. G. Woffenden wrote in the 1960s: \\"Edmund Blacket was an upright God-fearing man who shunned controversy, professional publicity and social acclaim. An exemplary husband and father, he had been churchwarden and alderman, and was widely respected and admired for honesty, diligence, accuracy, fortitude and propriety.\\" Influence The view across the transept of St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, shows Blacket's mastery of the Late Gothic idiom. Blacket's architectural practice was to be one of the most influential in Australia's history. His first articled pupil was William Kemp whose apprenticeship was interrupted when Blacket became Colonial Architect. During the 1860s, Blacket's son Owen began training, followed by Cyril in 1872 and the older son, Arthur, who worked in the \\"Blacket and Sons\\" business in the 1880s. In 1880, Cyril travelled to England where he took his examination at the Royal Institute of British Architects, returning to Australia to put up his plate as \\"Cyril Blacket A.R.I.B.A.\\". In 1903, he was elected president of the New South Wales Institute of Architects. After Edmund's death, Cyril and Arthur worked for a time as \\"Blacket Brothers\\", the most famous building of this period being the Hunter Baillie Memorial Presbyterian Church (1886) which from its position on the ridge pays homage across the suburbs of Annandale and Camperdown to their father's spire of St Stephen's, Newtown, on the parallel ridge. Cyril's other well-known work is the chapter-house for St. Andrew's Cathedral. Two later Blackets, Cyril's son Pendril and Harold Wilfred Blacket were to follow the family tradition as architects. During the 1850s, Blacket employed James Barnet, who had emigrated from Scotland, having studied architecture under C.J. Richardson. He worked for Blacket as Clerk of Works for Sydney University, and it has been suggested that the massive hammer-beam roof of the Great Hall may have been his design. Barnet was to become the most successful of the Colonial Architects, with many of his public buildings still serving their original purposes. Of all the architects associated with Blacket, the one who would become most famous was John Horbury Hunt, who worked with him from 1863 to 1868. It was at this time, that Blacket's architecture developed bolder forms, based upon Norman, Transitional and Early French Gothic architecture, rather than the more refined Gothic. This is particularly noticeable in the presence of simple round windows divided by four circles of tracery in the gables of several churches of this time. Blacket permitted his staff to enter competitions, and it was while at Blacket's office that Horbury Hunt won the commission for Newcastle Cathedral, to be executed in his preferred material of brick. The brick church at Tumut, consecrated in 1873, is ascribed to Blacket, but appears to owe much to Hunt. Hunt, who lived most of his early life in North America, had previously worked under Edward Clarke Cabot. One of the innovations that he introduced to Australian architecture while working for Blacket was the saw-tooth roof for industrial building, which was employed at Mort's Woolstore. Hunt appears to have been influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly Philip Webb, and ultimately he created buildings of great originality such as the Anglican Cathedrals of Grafton and Armidale. Critique Not all critiqued Blacket's contribution favourably, with Woffenden opining in his 1967 biography drawn from his thesis that Blacket \\"... put tradition before innovation... [and] as a consequence stylistic development was severely restricted; quality declined as other less dedicated practitioners exploited popular taste by substituting burlesque plagiarism for scholarly eclecticism.\\" Partial list of works While Edmund Blacket's university buildings have been maintained and continue in use, few of Blacket's commercial buildings have survived, with none of his Sydney banks remaining. Residential buildings are better represented, and include cottages, terrace houses and mansions. Of Blacket's more than 100 designs for churches, 84 can be identified as having been built to his plans, with a number of others being detailed or substantially designed by his sons Arthur and Cyril. In addition he supervised the building of several other churches and made major contributions to a dozen more, such as the towers and spires at St John's, Darlinghurst and Christ Church St. Laurence, the chancel of St John's, Camden and the roof of St. Judes, Randwick.

Biography Early life Rejt≈ë was born in Budapest into a Jewish family.Tibor Frank, Double Exile: Migrations of Jewish-Hungarian Professionals Through Germany to the United States, 1919-1945, Peter Lang (2008), p. 449 His first cello teacher was Frederick Teller, a local teacher whose ideas, for the time, were exceptionally forward- looking. At sixteen, Rejt≈ë entered the Academy of Music under Adolf Schiffer (a pupil of and later assistant to David Popper), and two years later, with his Artist‚Äôs Diploma, he began his European concert career. Education From the age of 20, Rejt≈ë studied with Pablo Casals for two years, first in Barcelona and then in Prades. Casals had revolutionized the approach to the cello and when he worked with Rejt≈ë, they spent almost a month on just basic technique. Rejt≈ë then played in concerts throughout Europe, with major symphony orchestras such as those in Vienna, Budapest, Rome, and Warsaw, as well as in solo recitals. Career G√°bor Rejt≈ë with the Alma Trio, 1947 In 1952, G√°bor Rejt≈ë and Yaltah Menuhin undertook a tour of New Zealand together. Over a period of five weeks, they gave twenty-five concerts to great critical acclaim. Rejto was a resident of the United States from 1939 until his death. During his career, he was on the faculty of the Manhattan and Eastman Schools of Music. From 1954 to his death, he was professor of cello at the University of Southern California. He was also one of the cellists in the Paganini Quartet and the Hungarian Quartet, and was a founding member of the Alma Trio, a piano trio, and remained with that ensemble from 1942 until it disbanded in 1976; in the early 1980s, the trio reformed, with Rejto again as the cellist. Rejto taught for a number of years at the Music Academy of the West summer program for gifted students, where his master classes were extremely popular, not just with cellists. His experience in chamber music attracted many students to his cello workshops held throughout the United States. In 1972, Rejt≈ë was chosen Artist Teacher of the Year at the American String Teachers Association's 25th Anniversary Conference. Family Rejt≈ë's son, Peter Rejto, is a cellist and a former faculty member at the Oberlin Conservatory. He was a founding member of the Los Angeles Piano Quartet. G√°bor Rejt≈ë's daughter, Nika S. Rejto, is a jazz flutist. She released an album entitled Teazing Socrates in 2006, dedicated to her late father.

In 1927, Philips began producing radios. Only five years later, Philips had sold one million of them. One other major product release came in 1963, when the Compact Cassette was introduced. After Philips Consumer Electronics acquired companies as Magnavox and Sylvania in the late 1970s, Philips managed to sell their 100-millionth TV-set in 1984. Philips still is the European television market leader, as well as the third in the world. Because of the enormous growth, Philips decided to split up their company divisions during the 1990s. While Philips CE contains most of the Consumer Electronics, other products such as Philips' shavers were located under the Domestic Appliances division. As of 2012 Philips is no longer directly involved in TV manufacturing, because it has outsourced it to a joint venture with TPV Technology, called TP Vision.http://www.techdigest.tv/2012/04/philips_spin-of.html Philips announced in January 2013http://www.newscenter.philips.com/us_en/standard/news/press/2013/20130129-Philips- transfer-AVMA-Funai.wpd#.UQhLt0qOi0c that it agreed to sell its consumer electronics division to Japan-based Funai Electric Co. for Euro 150 million (US$201.8 million).

Although there were other magnetic tape cartridge systems, the Compact Cassette became dominant as a result of Philips's decision to license the format free of charge. Laserdisc Laserdisc was a 30 cm disc designed with MCA meant to compete with VHS and even replace it. It was not as generally popular as VHS, because of the initial investment costs of players, somewhat higher costs of movie titles, and the read-only format. But like Betamax, it enjoyed extensive success among serious video collectors. The technologies created for Laserdisc would later be used again for the Compact Disc. Compact Disc (CD) Although Philips' and MCA's Laserdisc project never reached the VHS mass market level, Philips still thought the format should be able to succeed, and, in collaboration with Sony, launched the smaller CD in 1982. Philips optical disk Philips Cdi DVD The DVD (Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc), the eventual successor of the CD (Compact Disc), met a long road of setbacks. Philips wanted to continue with the CD in a new format called MultiMedia Compact Disc (MMCD), while another group (led by Toshiba) was developing a competing format, then named Super Density (SD) disc. Their representatives approached IBM for advice on the file system. IBM also learned of Philips' and Sony's initiative. IBM convinced a group of computer industry experts (among them Apple, Dell, etc.) to form a working group. The Technical Working Group (TWG) voted to boycott both formats unless they merged to prevent another format war (like the videotape format war). The result was the DVD specification, finalized in 1995. The DVD video format was first introduced in Japan in 1996, later in 1997 in the U.S. as limited test run, then across Europe and the other continents from late 1998 onwards. Blu-ray Disc Blu-ray Disc, yet again primarily developed by Philips and Sony, utilizes blue-violet coloured diodes to create an even shorter wavelength beam than CD or DVD. Because of this, the capacity is much more than that of CD or DVD, being 25 GB single-layered or 50 GB dual-layered.

As a player, he was a defender from 1986 to 2005 and was best known for his time as a player at Nottingham Forest where he made 415 league appearances and played numerous seasons in the Premier League, won the League Cup and was a runner-up in the FA Cup. Despite playing most of his career in the top level of English football, Chettle never made the England squad, but came close in 1992, despite this Chettle played 12 games for the England Under-21s, captaining them in his final appearance. He went on to play for Barnsley, Walsall and Grimsby Town before ending his career in Non-League football with stints at Burton Albion and Ilkeston Town. Since his retirement, Chettle had coached at former club Forest at academy level, before joining Ilkeston in 2014. Career Nottingham Forest Chettle was promoted from the youth team setup at his hometown club of Nottingham Forest. His first senior season was the 1986‚Äì1987 campaign. He went on to become a talisman in the Forest side of the late eighties and late nineties, and was ever present in each of the sides he played in, and managers he worked under. Steve is held in high regard by the Forest faithful after spending 13 years at the City Ground where he is considered a hero. He was initially part of a young crop of players that came into life at Forest under the famous Brian Clough, and was part of the Forest side that lost the 1991 FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium against Tottenham Hotspur, as well as being part of the triumphant 1990 League Cup winning side. Chettle went on to play 527 times for Forest in all competitions, scoring 11 goals between 1986 and 1999. Each of Chettle's seasons at Forest were played in the top flight of English football, bar 1993-94 and 1997‚Äì99. In the 1994‚Äì95 season, he was part of the side that finished a notable third in the Premier League. As players and managers came and left, Chettle stayed with the club, and notably played alongside such Forest greats as Des Walker, Stuart Pearce, Nigel Clough, Ian Woan, Steve Stone, Mark Crossley, Stan Collymore and Pierre Van Hooijdonk. Barnsley In 1999, Forest manager David Platt made Chettle available for loan, and eventually sent him on loan to Barnsley, who like Forest, were struggling in First Division at the time. The two clubs eventually struck a permanent deal after impressing in the two games played during his loan spell. This would then spell the end for Chettle's 13-year Forest career, as he signed for the Oakwell club in December 1999. Chettle went on to play out the rest of the 1999‚Äì2000 season for the club, as well as competing in the 2000‚Äì01 and 2001‚Äì02 seasons. His final game for the club was a 5‚Äì1 thumping away at Manchester City on the final day of the season. Chettle was released by Barnsley in the summer of 2002. Grimsby Town In July 2002, two months after his release from Barnsley, Chettle and fellow Tykes defender Darren Barnard joined league rivals Grimsby Town on one-year contracts. Chettle was seen as an ideal candidate to step in the centre of defence and started the season alongside the club's player-manager Paul Groves and Jamaican youngster Simon Ford. After a slow start to the season for Grimsby, Steve saw his season blighted by injury, and through this, it pushed manager Groves into signing Sheffield United centre half Georges Santos and Middlesbrough's Jason Gavin as cover. Steve eventually returned from injury in early 2003, and went on to score his only goal for The Mariners in a 4‚Äì1 home defeat against Crystal Palace. Grimsby were relegated at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, Groves decided against offering Chettle a fresh contract, thus sealing his departure from the Lincolnshire club. Burton Albion Several months after his departure from Blundell Park, Chettle acted upon an offer to work with Nigel Clough, the son of his former Forest manager, and sign with Conference National side Burton Albion. Clough at the time was the player/manager of the non-league club. Chettle signed a one-year contract with Burton, and he would remain with the club for the 2003‚Äì04 season. This would be Chettle's only year at the Pirelli Stadium and he departed in the summer of 2004. Ilkeston Town Following one season with Burton, Chettle moved down the non-league footballing ladder, signing for Ilkeston Town in July 2004. Chettle featured at centre back that season with notably forming a formidable partnership with long serving ex Grimsby defender Mark Lever. This would eventually be both players' final season, and Chettle decided to retire from competitive football at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season. Coaching career Following his retirement and leaving Ilkeston, Chettle moved to run a soccer school in his native Nottingham. He subsequently worked at the Nottingham Forest Academy, including a spell as coach of the under 18's squad with Gary Brazil. During the 2013‚Äì14 season, Chettle departed Forest to become assistant manager at Ilkeston, also becoming the club's academy manager. He became assistant manager of Nuneaton Town in the summer of 2015, following manager Kevin Wilson. In July 2017, he was appointed manager of Ilkeston Town. In August 2018, he joined Notts County's backroom staff, but would still be Ilkeston manager until a permanent replacement was appointed. Following Kevin Nolan's dismissal as manager, Chettle was named as caretaker manager alongside Mark Crossley; their only match in charge was a 3‚Äì1 home loss to Forest Green Rovers. In September 2018, he was succeeded as Ilkeston's manager by Martin McIntosh. On 17 August 2018 he joined the coaching staff at Notts County under Kevin Nolan.https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football- news/former-nottingham-forest-defender-steve-1909881.amp Nine days later he was placed in temporary charge along with Mark Crossley following the dismissal of Nolan.https://amp.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/26/kevin- nolan-sacked-by-notts-county-with-winless-club-bottom-of-league-two On 13 November 2018 he was again appointed caretaker manager following the sacking of Nolan's replacement Harry Kewell.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/amp/football/46192363 On 25 April 2019, Chettle was named manager of head of development at Basford United.http://www.basfordunited.co.uk/news/basford-united-club-structure- announcement-appoint-2420303.html Personal life Chettle's son Callum is also a professional footballer and plays for Alfreton Town.

Life and career He was born Lajos Kentner in Karwin in Austrian Silesia (present-day Karvin√°, Czech Republic), to Hungarian parents. He received his education as a musician at the Royal Academy of Music in Budapest from 1911 to 1922, studying with Arnold Sz√©kely (piano), Hans Koessler and Zolt√°n Kod√°ly (composition), and Leo Weiner (chamber music). Kentner commenced his concert career at the age of 15. Until 1931 he was known internationally as Ludwig Kentner. He was awarded 5th Prize at the 1932 International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw; and he won a Liszt Prize in Budapest. He moved to England permanently in 1935. He gave radio broadcasts of the complete sonatas of Beethoven and Schubert, the complete Well-Tempered Clavier (Bach), and the complete Ann√©es de p√®lerinage (Liszt). He was President of the British Liszt Society for many years, until his death. In 1975 he invited the Argentinian young pianist Enrique A. Danowicz, in order to take his musical education under his personal care at the Menuhin School of Music in London,U.K., where Kentner was director at the time. Kodaly composed his Dances of Marossz√©k for Kentner, who premiered the work in Budapest on 14 March 1927. At the composer's request, he was the soloist at the Hungarian premiere of Bart√≥k's Piano Concerto No. 2, in Budapest in 1933, under Otto Klemperer; and the first European performance of the Concerto No. 3 (in London, under Sir Adrian Boult, 27 November 1946). He and Yehudi Menuhin (his second wife's brother-in-law) gave the first performance of William Walton's Violin Sonata, at Z√ºrich on 30 September 1949. His playing was heard in Richard Addinsell's Warsaw Concerto from the soundtrack of the 1941 film Dangerous Moonlight. However, his hands were not shown, and he preferred to be uncredited as he did not think that being associated with film music would help his career. When the piece achieved worldwide popularity, however, he was happy to acknowledge his involvement. He was a member of many music competition juries. He also composed, his output including orchestral works, chamber music, piano pieces and songs. Private life His first wife was the pianist Ilona Kabos. That marriage ended in 1945, and he then married Griselda Gould, daughter of the pianist Evelyn Suart (Lady Harcourt), whose other daughter Diana became Yehudi Menuhin's second wife in 1947.

FishBase Adults are 12‚Äì14 in (30‚Äì35 cm) long and weigh 1.0‚Äì2.0 lb (0.4‚Äì0.8 kg), though rare individuals can weigh 8 lb at 24 in long. It has a robust, slightly compressed body, with a pointed head. Its color varies from silvery to bronze. Fins and tails are yellow and the snout contains blue stripes. As the common name suggests, schoolmaster snapper live in groups of dozens of subjects. They keep a short distance from the sea floor at depths between 10 and 90 ft, prefer the cover provided by coral reefs during the day, and expand their range to seagrass beds at night. The schoolmaster snapper is sometimes called the barred snapper or the caji. Like other snapper species, it is a popular food fish. Distribution The schoolmaster snapper is found in coastal areas of Florida, the Bahamas, and the Caribbean. It lives in shallow, clear, warm, coastal waters over coral reefs, sand with plants, and mud in mangrove areas or other reef-associated bottom types. Juveniles stay over sand bottoms with or without seagrasses, and over muddy bottoms of lagoons or mangrove areas. The young tend to be in littoral (shore) areas, grass plains and from time to time enter briny waters. They may be seen resting in accumulations during the day. The groups of juveniles in shallow coastal waters, as they grow, move into deeper and deeper water. Large schools are often noticed by divers over shallow wrecks and certain coral patches, and this behavior inspired the common name. Adults usually stay near shore at depths ranging from 0 to 200 ft (2‚Äì60 m) and shelter around elkhorn and gorgonian coral. Large adults are sometimes found on the continental shelf. Typical depths are up to 12 ft (4 m).Nocturnal migration patterns of two Caribbean reef fishes, Haemulun sciu and Lutjanus apodus. Steven Hitt, Center for Marine and Environmental Studies, University of the Virgin Islands, accessed 20 February 2012. reported that at night, schoolmaster snapper may increase their range to twice the daytime range, mostly by visiting seagrass beds. Characteristics The schoolmaster snapper has a husky, moderately deep body with a pointed head. Its thickness can be more than a third of its standard length. The head is large, and as long as the body is thick; the representation is straight from snout to the backside, and regularly curved to the large, unforked tail. Its triangular snout is long and pointed, with a large mouth. One of the upper pairs of canine teeth is clearly larger than back teeth in the lower jaw and can be seen when mouth is closed. There are 40 to 45, usually 42 to 44, tubed scales in the lateral line. The interior scale rows on back are parallel to lateral line. The soft dorsal and anal fins have scales. The single dorsal fin has 10 spines and 14 soft rays; the spiny portions of the fin are not deeply engraved at the junction with the soft portion. The anal fin has three spines and eight soft rays that are rounded from the tail. The caudal fin is emarginated. The 16 or 17 rays of the pectoral fins are longer than the distance from longest point of the snout to tail edge of preopercle, reaching the level of anus. The color is olive gray to brownish on upper back and upper sides, with yellow to reddish mite around the head. The lower sides and belly are lighter; there is no dark lateral spot below the anterior part of soft dorsal fin. There are 8 narrow, light vertical bars on the side of the body which may be faded or absent in large adults. A solid or broken blue line runs beneath the eye; it may also disappear with growth. From the upper jaw to the tip of the fleshy opercle, the line is often broken into parts that resemble dashes and spots. The fin and tail is bright yellow, yellow green, or pale orange, and the snout contains blue stripes. Rooker reported the diet of small L. apodus (<70 mm) consisted of crustaceans (more than 90%), specifically amphipods and crabs. Larger schoolmaster snapper preferred smaller fish (more than 50% by weight) and also ate crabs, shrimp, and stomatopods. He attributed the difference in eating habits to the fact that the bigger fish could open their jaws wider for bigger prey. Reproduction and growth Schoolmaster snapper are gonochorist, meaning males and females are separate. They spawn over most of the year, with the majority of the spawning happening during middle to late summer. They spawn during April‚ÄìJune off Cuba. They reproduce by spawning in open water with both male and female fish releasing their gametes at the same time. The fertilized eggs then settle to the bottom, where they are left unguarded. Most mature schoolmaster snapper average a pound (0.4 kg) or less in shallow water. Big individuals on the deep reefs may reach six or seven pounds. They can grow up to 8 lb and 24 in (62 cm) long, but individuals 12‚Äì14 inches (35 cm) long are more commonly observed. Weight:length relationship for schoolmaster snapper L. apodus As fish grow longer, they increase in weight, but the relationship is not linear. The relationship between length (L) and weight (W) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form: :W = cL^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c varies between species. A weight-length relationship based on 100 schoolmaster snapper ranging in length from 2 to 7 in (50 mm to 180 mm) found the coefficient c was 0.000050015 and the exponent b was 2.9107. This relationship suggests a 12.5-inch schoolmaster snapper (320 mm) will weigh about 2.2 lb (1 kg). Commercial and recreational use Schoolmaster snapper, along with other snapper species, are sought by both recreational and commercial fishermen. Their food quality is reported to be excellent. Fishing regulations in US state waters are specific to each state, but they have similarities. For example, the minimum length in Florida for schoolmaster snapper is 10 in (about 25 cm) total length with a catch limit of 10 per fisherman per day. However, the 10-fish limit is an aggregate for all species of snapper. Florida fishing regulations for snapper species. myfwc.com Louisiana and South Carolina have similar limits except the minimum length is 12 in (about 30 cm) total length, and nonstainless steel circle hooks and natural bait are required.South Carolina saltwater fishing regulations . dnr.sc.gov These regulations are consistent with current US guidelines for schoolmaster snapper caught in federal waters. South Atlantic Fishery Management Council Recreational fishing regulations for snapper. South Atlantic Fishery Management Council Commercial fishing regulations for snapper. Accessed 20 February 2012 The guidelines change from time to time. In certain marine protected areas,Snapper Grouper Amendment 14 ‚Äì MPAs. South Atlantic Fishery Management Council fishing is not allowed to help specific species maintain or recover healthy populations. Light spinning and baitcasting tackle are used to fish for schoolmaster snapper. Live shrimp and baitfish, as well as shrimp pieces and cut bait, are the best natural bait. While jigs make for the best artificial bait, artificials are rarely used and rarely successful. Similar species Larger schoolmaster snapper whose white vertical bars are faded might be mistaken for dog snapper. The schoolmaster, however, does not have the white cone-shaped patch on the gill that identifies the dog snapper. Though different in appearance, schoolmaster snapper have habits similar to those of the mangrove snapper.

History   Battle at Winnepang (Jeddore Harbour)  In July 1722, the Abenaki created a blockade around Annapolis Royal, the capital of Nova Scotia, in an attempt to starve it. They captured eighteen fishing vessels along with prisoners between present-day Yarmouth and Canso. They also captured vessels and took prisoners from the Bay of Fundy. In response, to protect the capital from native attack, Lieutenant Governor John Doucett took 22 Mi'kmaq hostage at Annapolis Royal and Massachusetts declared war on the Abenaki. During Dummer's War, Governor Richard Philipps commissioned Capt. John Eliot and Capt. John Robinson in two sloops with regiments to protect the fishery at Canso and retrieve the captured vessels and prisoners. Toward this end, Capt. Eliot made a surprise attack on forty natives on a ship at Winnepang (present-day Jeddore Harbour)., names the site of the battle site as \\"Winnepang\\". Rev. Silas , states Jeddore was called \\"Wineboogwechk\\", which is likely a corruption of Winnepang. The place name Wineboogwƒïchk' and the descriptive of \\"to flow roughly\\" translates to winpƒïgitk or winpƒïgijooik, that is, Winnepang; also see Bruce Furguson. Place- Names and Places of Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia Archives. p. 314). The natives were among six of the fishing vessels they had seized. There was a two-hour naval battle. Capt. Eliot was badly wounded as were several of his men. Five were killed. Then Capt. Eliot lobbed a hand granadoes (type of hand grenade) into the native vessel. Some natives were killed in the explosion. Others tried to swim ashore as they were being shot by the New Englanders. Thirty- five Natives were killed. The New Englanders managed to rescue fifteen prisoners from the vessels, while discovering that nine had been killed.; Geoffery , also recounts the battle at Jaddore Harbour. He states that New Englanders set fire to Mi'kmaq vessels. The warriors tried to swim to land, but the New England men fired on them in the water. Twenty two were reported killed. Only five bodies were recovered and the New Englanders decapitated the corpses and set the severed heads on pikes surrounding Canso's new fort. Murdoch's and Plank's versions differ slightly. The Natives had sent the other sixteen prisoners to Richibucto, New Brunswick. Only five native bodies were recovered from the battle and the New Englanders decapitated the corpses and set the severed heads on pikes surrounding Canso's new fort. Captain Robinson captured ten of the vessels and killed numerous Abenaki. He then arrived at Malagash harbour where the natives held five of the fishing vessels along with twenty prisoners. Robinson paid a ransom and they were released.  Raids on Jeddore  The Mi'kmaq at West Jeddore complained of English fishermen raiding the supplies they received from the government (1753). On one occasion after a raid, the same English vessel which raided the village was wrecked on the rocks. While the Mi'kmaq are reported to have taken care of them, the English were reported to have killed two men, three women, one child and one baby for their scalps.Whitehead, pp. 131, 136, 137  Festivals  Head of Jeddore used to host the annual Pirates of Jeddore Festival in September.

His family name was Gerecht, of which Justus is merely a Latin translation. The appellation, however, by which he is generally known is that of Lanspergius (latinization 'of Landsberg'), from his birthplace. Biography He was born at Landsberg am Lech in Bavaria 1489, died at Cologne on 11 August 1539. After studying philosophy at the University of Cologne, he joined the Carthusian Order at the age of twenty (1509), entering the Charterhouse of St. Barbara at Cologne. He was named novice-master there in 1520, and in 1530 became prior of the Charterhouse of Vogelsang near J√ºlich, where according to Hartzheim, he was also preacher (concionator) to the Court of William, Duke of J√ºlich, and confessor to the duke's mother. Because of bad health in 1534 he had to return to Cologne, where a few years later he was named sub-prior and remained in that office until his death. He was a monk of saintly life, employing all the time he could spare from his duties towards others in prayer, contemplation and writing on ascetical and mystical subjects. Writings His literary works comprise paraphrases and homilies on the Epistles and Gospels of the liturgical year, sermons for Sundays and festivals, meditations and discourses on the Life and Passion of Christ, and a variety of treatises, sermons, letters, meditations etc. on subjects pertaining to the spiritual life. He was not a polemist. Among his productions the only ones of a controversial kind are two dissertations against Lutheran errors (from the Catholic point of view) and in defense of the monastic life. These two treatises are also all that he wrote in German, his other writings being in Latin. The chief feature of his writings is ardent and tender piety. The love of God for man, calling for a corresponding love of man for God, is his usual theme treated in various ways. One thing particularly worthy of mark is the frequency with which he speaks of the Heart of Christ, and pressingly exhorts every Christian to take the Sacred Heart as an object of special love, veneration and imitation. Indeed, it may perhaps be said that no one before him had laid down and explained so clearly the principles upon which that devotion is grounded, nor had so developed their practical application. He was one of the last, and was perhaps the most precise in language, of those whose written teachings paved the way for Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque and her mission, and helped to prepare the Catholic mind for the great devotion of modern times. To him also Catholics owed the first Latin edition (Cologne, 1536) of the \\"Revelations of Saint Gertrude\\". The best known of his treatises is the \\"Alloquia Jesu Christi ad animam fidelem\\", which has been translated into Spanish, Italian, French and English. The English translation, done by Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, who died in the Tower of London under Elizabeth I, has reached its fourth edition (London, 1867). A new and revised edition of all the works of Lanspergius in Latin has been issued by the Carthusian press of Notre-Dame- des-Pr√©s (Tournai, 1890), in five quarto volumes. The same press has published separately the treatise \\"Pharetra Divini Amoris\\" (18mo., 1892) and a French version of the \\"Alloquia\\", untitled \\"Entretiens de J√©sus Christ avec l'√¢me fid√®le\\" (18mo, 1896).

Plot introduction Peter Diggs has a vivid dream in which he meets a woman called Amaryllis. When he later encounters the same woman in real life, he discovers that the two of them have the ability to enter each other's dreams. A cautious relationship is begun, half in the real world and half in dreams, in which both parties struggle to overcome the emotional effects of previous failed romances. Characters *Peter Diggs, the narrator of the novel, an artist in his early thirties *Amaryllis, who has the power to ‚Äòtune in‚Äô to people's dreams *Lenore, Peter's former girlfriend, an artist with emotional problems *Ron Hastings, a student of Peter's who appears in his dreams and who may also know Amaryllis Major themes The novel is by turns romantic, philosophical, funny, sexy, and frightening, as the characters explore the different possibilities offered by their unique talent. Both Peter and Amaryllis have been involved in failed relationships before ‚Äì exactly how many and how disastrously we only find out gradually ‚Äì and they are haunted by the danger of repeating their past mistakes. Hoban's writing builds up a series of metaphors throughout the book so that, as in a dream, many things take on unusual significance, or seem to represent something else. The idea of the dream itself seems to function for Hoban as a symbol of the way in which elements from the past come back to affect the present day, and in the characters' dreams various significant people and objects from real life appear in exaggerated forms, not all of which are fully explained. The names, too, are full of meaning: Amaryllis is linked to the botanical genus of Amaryllis, related to deadly nightshade, and Lenore is explicitly linked with her namesake in Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"The Raven.\\" The hypothetical object known as a Klein bottle plays an important role in the book after Peter visits the London Science Museum. Klein bottles are four-dimensional one-sided bodies which can only exist in three- dimensional space by intersecting with themselves. This concept is built up in the book as a metaphor for the way people cross and re-cross important physical and emotional points in their lives. Peter is a painter and Amaryllis a musician, and there is a lot of reflection in the book about art's ability to reflect and enrich a person's emotional life. A great many other artists are referenced during the book (see below). Early in the novel, Peter mentions a review of his paintings which comments on the ‚Äòodd empty spaces‚Äô in his work. Peter muses: Allusions/references to other works Many other writers and musicians are mentioned or quoted in the novel, including: * Nelson Algren's A Walk on the Wild Side *The Tom Waits song Walking Spanish * Edward Hopper's painting Gas (which the characters enter during a dream) *The Sleeping Beauty fairytale * Brer Rabbit *The Negro spiritual There is a Balm in Gilead * Milton's Lycidas (which includes the line ‚Äòto sport with Amaryllis in the shade‚Äô) *The film \\"Dreamscape\\" *The prisons etchings of Piranesi * Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey * Georg Christoph Lichtenberg *The self-help ‚Äòlife coach‚Äô Anthony Robbins * Barbara Strozzi *The 1930s song \\"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries\\" * Oliver Onions's story \\"The Beckoning Fair One\\" * Walter de la Mare's poem ‚ÄòFare Well‚Äô * Melville's Moby-Dick Adaptations According to fansites, the book has been optioned by Doppelganger Films.

It is a phenomenon most commonly witnessed in sepsis, and less frequently in autoimmune diseases, differentiation syndrome, engraftment syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, viral hemorrhagic fevers, and snakebite and ricin poisoning. Pharmaceuticals, including the chemotherapy medications gemcitabine and tagraxofusp, as well as certain interleukins and monoclonal antibodies, can also cause capillary leaks. These conditions and factors are sources of secondary capillary leak syndrome. Systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS, or Clarkson's disease), or primary capillary leak syndrome, is a rare, grave and episodic medical condition observed largely in otherwise healthy individuals mostly in middle age. It is characterized by self-reversing episodes during which the endothelial cells which line the capillaries, usually of the extremities, separate for one to three days, causing a leakage of plasma mainly into the muscle compartments of the arms and legs. The abdomen, the central nervous system, and the organs (including the lungs) are typically spared, but the extravasation in the extremities is sufficiently massive to cause circulatory shock and compartment syndromes, with a dangerous hypotension (low blood pressure), hemoconcentration (thickening of the blood) and hypoalbuminemia (drop in albumin, a major protein) in the absence of other causes for such abnormalities. SCLS is thus a limb- and life-threatening illness, because each episode has the potential to cause damage to limb muscles and nerves, as well as to vital organs due to limited perfusion. It is often misdiagnosed as polycythemia, polycythemia vera, hyperviscosity syndrome, or sepsis. Symptoms Most SCLS patients report having flu-like symptoms (like a runny nose), or else gastro-intestinal disorders (diarrhea or vomiting), or a general weakness or pain in their limbs, but others get no particular or consistent warning signs ahead of their episodes. They subsequently develop thirst and lightheadedness and the following conditions measurable in a hospital emergency-room setting: * hemoconcentration (elevated hematocrit or hemoglobin readings, with hematocrit levels >49% in men and >43% in women, not because of an absolute increase in them but because of the leak of plasma); * very low blood pressure (profound arterial hypotension, with systolic blood pressure levels <90 mm Hg); * albumin deficiency (hypoalbuminemia measuring <3.0 g/dL); * partial or generalized edema, and cold extremities; * a paraprotein in the blood (an MGUS in approximately 80% of cases). Cause Although the precise molecular cause of SCLS remains undetermined, scientific research in recent years, conducted mainly at a unit (NIAID) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, has shed some light on its biological and chemical roots. The study of the peripheral microvasculature from patients‚Äô biopsy specimens has not evidenced gross anomalies, disrupted angiogenesis, or inflammatory cells or other factors suggestive of a disorder prone to damage the blood vessels by inflammation. The absence of structural abnormalities is thus consistent with the hypothesis of some kind of defective but curiously reversible cellular phenomenon in the capillaries. Studies suggest that the presence of various inflammatory factors during episodes of SCLS may explain the temporarily abnormal permeability of the endothelial cells lining the inner surface of the capillaries. These include transient spikes in monocyte- and macrophage-associated inflammatory mediators and temporary increases in the proteins vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2. The impairment of endothelial cells in laboratory conditions provoked by serum taken from patients who were having episodes of SCLS is also suggestive of biochemical factors at work. There is no evidence that SCLS is hereditary, and the role of specific gene defects in patients with SCLS, which might program their endothelial cells for an overreaction to external stimuli, has not been established. The significance, if any, of the paraprotein (MGUS) present in most patients with SCLS is unknown, other than it has been a precursor to multiple myeloma in a minority (7% in the largest reported cohort) of SCLS patients. Diagnosis SCLS is often difficult to recognize and diagnose on initial presentation, and thus misdiagnoses are frequent. The characteristic triad of profound arterial hypotension, hemoconcentration (elevated hematocrit, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis), and hypoalbuminemia in the absence of secondary causes of shock and infection, requires diagnosis in a monitored, hospital setting during or after an acute episode. The fact that the condition is exceedingly rare ‚Äì an estimated one per million inhabitants ‚Äì and that several other diseases exhibit features akin to SCLS, including secondary capillary-leak syndrome or hypoproteinemia, militate against early identification. Preserved consciousness, despite severe shock and hypotension, is an additional and most intriguing clinical manifestation often reported during episodes at hospital admission. Treatment The natural history of SCLS episodes indicates they resolve spontaneously within 2-to-4 days, and that they consist of two distinct phases: The capillary leak phase The initial stage is the capillary leak phase, lasting from 1 to 3 days, during which up to 70% of total plasma volume may invade cavities especially in the extremities. The most common clinical features are flu-like symptoms such as fatigue; runny nose; lightheadedness up to and including syncope (fainting); limb, abdominal or generalized pain; facial or other edema; dyspnea; and hypotension that results in circulatory shock and potentially in cardiopulmonary collapse and other organ distress or damage. Acute kidney injury or failure is a common risk due to acute tubular necrosis consequent to hypovolemia and rhabdomyolysis. The loss of fluid out of the capillaries has similar effects on the circulation as dehydration, slowing both the flow of oxygen delivered to tissues and organs as well as the output of urine. Urgent medical attention in this phase consists of fluid resuscitation efforts, mainly the intravenous administration of saline solution plus hetastarch or albumin and colloids (to increase the remaining blood flow to vital organs like the kidneys), as well as glucocorticoids (steroids like methylprednisolone, to reduce or stop the capillary leak). However effective on blood pressure, the impact of fluid therapy is always transient and leads to increased extravascular fluid accumulation, engendering multiple complications especially compartment syndrome and thus limb-destructive rhabdomyolysis. Consequently, patients experiencing episodes of SCLS should be closely monitored in a hospital intensive-care setting, including for orthopedic complications requiring surgical decompression, and their fluid therapy should be minimized as much as possible. The recruitment phase The second stage features the reabsorption of the initially extravasated fluid and albumin from the tissues, and it usually lasts 1 to 2 days. Intravascular fluid overload leads to polyuria and can cause flash pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest, with possibly fatal consequences. Death from SCLS typically occurs during this recruitment phase because of pulmonary edema arising from excessive intravenous fluid administration during the earlier leak phase. The severity of the problem depends on to the quantity of fluid supplied in the initial phase, the damage that may have been sustained by the kidneys, and the promptness with which diuretics are administered to help the patient discharge the accumulated fluids quickly. A recent study of 59 acute episodes occurring in 37 hospitalized SCLS patients concluded that high-volume fluid therapy was independently associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and that the main complications of SCLS episodes were recovery-phase pulmonary edema (24%), cardiac arrhythmia (24%), compartment syndrome (20%), and acquired infections (19%). The prevention of episodes of SCLS has involved two approaches. The first has long been identified with the Mayo Clinic, and it recommended treatment with beta agonists such as terbutaline, phosphodiesterase-inhibitor theophylline, and leukotriene-receptor antagonists montelukast sodium. The rationale for use of these drugs was their ability to increase intracellular cyclic AMP (adenosine monophosphate) levels, which might counteract inflammatory signaling pathways that induce endothelial permeability. It was the standard of care until the early 2000s, but was sidelined afterwards because patients frequently experienced renewed episodes of SCLS, and because these drugs were poorly tolerated due to their unpleasant side effects. The second, more recent approach pioneered in France during the last decade (early 2000s) involves monthly intravenous infusions of immunoglobulins (IVIG), with an initial dose of 2 gr/kg/month of body weight, which has proven very successful as per abundant case-report evidence from around the world. IVIG has long been used for the treatment of autoimmune and MGUS-associated syndromes, because of its potential immunomodulatory and anticytokine properties. The precise mechanism of action of IVIG in patients with SCLS is unknown, but it is likely that it neutralizes their proinflammatory cytokines that provoke endothelial dysfunction. A recent review of clinical experience with 69 mostly European SCLS patients found that preventive treatment with IVIG was the strongest factor associated with their survival, such that an IVIG therapy should be the first-line preventive agent for SCLS patients. According to a recent NIH survey of patient experience, IVIG prophylaxis is associated with a dramatic reduction in the occurrence of SCLS episodes in most patients, with minimal side effects, such that it may be considered as frontline therapy for those with a clear-cut diagnosis of SCLS and a history of recurrent episodes. Prognosis In mostly Europeans experience with 69 patients during 1996‚Äì2016, the 5- and 10-year survival rates for SCLS patients were 78% and 69%, respectively, but the survivors received significantly more frequent preventive treatment with IVIG than did non-survivors. Five- and 10-year survival rates in patients treated with IVIG were 91% and 77%, respectively, compared to 47% and 37% in patients not treated with IVIG. Moreover, better identification and management of this condition appears to be resulting in lower mortality and improving survival and quality-of-life results as of late. History The syndrome was first described by a team of New York City physicians led by Dr. Bayard D. Clarkson in 1960, after whom it was later informally named. Beyond numerous case reports published since then, three comprehensive reviews of clinical and research experience were published in 2017.

Cohan for the short-lived 1908 Broadway musical Fifty Miles from Boston when it was introduced by James C. Marlowe. It celebrates, and to some extent mocks, his own Irish heritage. It is also an affectionate homage to Edward Harrigan, a previous great Irish American contributor to American musical theater. The song was performed by James Cagney and Joan Leslie in the 1942 film Yankee Doodle Dandy, a biopic of Cohan's life. In that film it was portrayed as an early work of Cohan's that he was shopping around. In real life, by 1907 he had already scored some major Broadway hits and had little need to try to sell individual songs to producers. Contemporary Irish-American singer Billy Murray made a very popular recording of the song for Victor Records (catalog No. 5197) in 1907. In his version, the answer \\"Harrigan!\\" to each question is shouted by a background group. Edward Meeker was another who enjoyed success with his recording of the song in 1907. Lyrics :Who is the man who will spend or will even lend? :Harrigan, that's me! :Who is your friend when you find that you need a friend? :Harrigan, that's me! :For I'm just as proud of my name, you see :As an emperor, czar or a king could be :Who is the man helps a man ev'ry time he can? :Harrigan, that's me! :H, A, double-R, I, G, A, N spells Harrigan :Proud of all the Irish blood that's in me :Divvil a man can say a word agin me :H, A, double-R, I, G, A, N you see :Is a name that a shame never has been connected with :Harrigan, that's me! :Who is the man never stood for a gadabout? :Harrigan, that's me! :Who is the man that the town's simply mad about? :Harrigan that's me! :The ladies and babies are fond of me :I'm fond of them, too, in return, you see :Who is the gent that's deserving a monument? :Harrigan, that's me! :H, A, double-R, I, G, A, N spells Harrigan :Proud of all the Irish blood that's in me :Divvil a man can say a word agin me :H, A, double-R, I, G, A, N you see :Is a name that a shame never has been connected with :Harrigan, that's me! Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961) The song was used decades later for a 1960-1961 ABC television series, Harrigan and Son, about a father-and-son law firm. Its lead players, Pat O'Brien and Roger Perry, would sing the song, silhouetted behind the closing credits of the show. In his New York gubernatorial campaigns in 1954 and 1958, as well as his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1956, Averell Harriman used a variation of the song, which sang of \\"H, A, double-R, I, M, A, N\\". In 1960, John F. Kennedy's campaign released a recording of Frank Sinatra singing a version of \\"High Hopes\\" that included lyrics written specifically for \\"K, E, double-N, E, D and Y\\". Note: The above- mentioned variation was penned by Margaret Boyan Childs. Mrs. Childs was a housewife from Highland Falls (the nearby village) and a waitress at The U.S. Hotel Thayer at West Point, which was located just inside the main Thayer Gate. Being of Irish heritage, Mrs. Childs often put the pen to the paper, creating variations to traditional songs, and creating poems that were appropriate to the occasion. On the day that Governor Harriman's visiting entourage were seated for lunch in the Hotel's dining room, it turned out that Margaret was the \\"waitress\\" assigned to their table. She handed the folded \\"ditty\\", penned in her very precise hand, to the Governor; and after reading it, he handed her a Ten Dollar Bill (quite a sum in the early 1950s), and asked if he could use it in his campaign. She said, \\"Of course\\", and that's the rest of the story. The song was adapted - replacing \\"H, A, double-R, I, G, A, N\\" with \\"G, I, double-L, I, G, A, N\\" - in the Gilligan's Island episode \\"The Little Dictator\\", when Gilligan dreams that he is the president of a banana republic. It was also featured several times in the 1938 film \\"Hold That Co-ed\\" as a campaign theme song for John Barrymore's character \\"Governor Gabby Harrigan\\". The song is subject of multiple parodies in American juvenile oral tradition, with versions about \\"L, O, Double L, I, P, O, P\\" or \\"D, A, V, E, N, P, O, R, T\\" and others. Examples can be found in \\"The Whim-Wham Book\\" by Duncan Emrich and in \\"Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts: The Subversive Folklore of Childhood\\" by Josepha Sherman and T. K. F. Weisskopf. The Kidsongs Kids and the Biggles covered the song in their 1998 video \\"Adventures in Biggleland: Meet the Biggles\\". The term \\"divvil\\" is an Irish expression that often found its way into Irish songs of that era. It essentially means \\"nary\\" or \\"hardly\\". Allan Sherman's short medley of Cohan song parodies included this tune, reworked to sing about pianist Vladimir Horowitz.

It is located on the A449 road, approximately 5 miles west of Dudley Town Centre and 9 miles north of Kidderminster. Geography Wall Heath is situated on the edge of the West Midlands conurbation, bordering Staffordshire to the west. It was formerly a part of the Kingswinford Rural District until its merger with the Brierley Hill Urban District in 1934. Since 1966 it has been a part of the Dudley County Borough, now the metropolitan borough. Wall heath also falls under the Kingswinford North and Wall Heath Ward with an population of 12,561 as of the 2011 Census. Closest cities, towns and villages Village services The village contains numerous outlets providing varied services; including a Co-op supermarket, Boots Local Pharmacy, a podiatrist and a private dental surgery. There are three public houses, two Indian restaurants, two Chinese take-aways, a Chinese restaurant, a pizza delivery/take-away, two Fish & Chip Shops and a catering company. There was, until recently, a small public library, which was closed by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council for economic reasons. The local authority states that the money from the closure of Wall Heath Library and four other Dudley libraries will be used for a ¬£2.3 million scheme to update services in the borough. The nearest Library is the Kingswinford Library. The other libraries in the borough which fell victim of the council policy were Quarry Bank, Amblecote, Dudley Wood and Woodside. There are two allotments in the village and three public parks located in the village. One is accessible from Albion Street and two are accessible from High Street. Located in Wall Heath is Holbeche House, which is where the flight of the gunpowder plotters ended. The building is now a private care home for the elderly. There is also a Dudley MBC shelter, The Gables, located in the village. The Wall Heath Community centre regularly hosts National Blood Service blood donation sessions. There are many events held here such as charity events and local classes for all ages including a nursery and yoga classes. There are also frequent displays showcasing old photographs of Wall Heath and the local area. The Wall Heath Horticultural Society also hold their meetingsat the centre on the first Tuesday in the month. You can find more details on their web site. http://wallheathhorticulturalguild.blogspot.co.uk/ Wall Heath Community Centre's playing fields are home to Phoenix Youth. Tennis courts are also situated on the site. In the last century, Wall Heath was the home of the Sant family (Maidensbridge Road). Herbert Sant won an MC during the First World War. His brother William became a famed artist whose work is displayed at the Tate Gallery in London and other notable locations. Ancestor Steven Sant born in nearby Dudley is a renowned writer on football and local politics. Wall Heath is served by bus routes 15/15a, 16, 17/17a which serve Wolverhampton, Stourbridge, Dudley or the Merry Hill Centre. Less frequent is service 57 between Stourbridge and Wall Heath. Apart from Sunday and evening journeys on service 17a which are operated by Diamond Bus, all routes are provided by National Express West Midlands. Sport The village has produced three professional cricketers; John (Jack) Alfred Flavell, Paul Pridgeon and Stuart Lampitt. All played for Worcestershire CCC, with Jack Flavell playing for the England national team. The village is home to Dudley Kingswinford Rugby Football Club (DKRFC), who after 2 promotions from the Midland League are currently playing in the National league 2 North. On the outskirts of the village is 'Eagle Park', home to Kewford Eagles Football Club. Churches There are three churches in the village. These are the Church of the Ascension, the smaller St Andrew's United Reformed Church and Wall Heath Evangelical Free Church.WHEFC.org The Church of the Ascension sits at the centre of the village next to the school of the same name, Church of the Ascension Primary School (CofE). Education The village is supported by two primary schools; Maidensbridge Primary School and Church of the Ascension CofE Primary School. Maidensbridge Primary School has hosted the Helen Taylor School of Dance for 20 years, who perform annually at the Wolverhampton Grand Theatre. On completion of primary education, typically the pupils from both schools continue their education at The Kingswinford School, in nearby Kingswinford or alternatively, Summerhill School, also in Kingswinford. Maidensbridge Primary School was saved from closure in 2005 due to campaigning by local residents. Politics The village is part of the Kingswinford North and Wall Heath ward of the Dudley Metropolitan Borough. It is represented by three seats on the Borough council. Currently these are occupied by two Liberal Democrat and one Conservative councillor. The village falls within the Dudley South constituency of the UK parliament.

The Nasiriyya order took its name (and its reputation) from founder Sidi Muhammad bin Nasir al-Drawi (1603‚Äì1674), who took over teaching at the Tamegroute zawiya in the 1640s. Since that time the leaders of the zawiya have been descendants of bin Nasir without interruption from father to son until the present day. Sidi Muhammad bin Nasir was a theologian, scholar and physician, especially interested in mental disorders. He wrote several works of fikh, some poetry, and hundreds of letters and treatises on Islamic law. He followed and extended the teachings of Shadhili and under his leadership the Nasiriyya became the 'mother'zawiya' of Sufi islam in the Maghreb with several branches in different parts of the country, including the zawiya of Irazan in the Sous valley where 500 students were financed by the brotherhood.For more information in the scholarly influence of the Nasiriyya, \\"Sufi networks and the Social Contexts for Scholarship in Morocco and the Northern Sahara, 1660‚Äì1830\\" by David Gutelius. In \\"The Transmission of Learning in Islamic Africa ed. Scott Reese. Leiden: Brill Academic Press, 2004. He was succeeded by his son Ahmad (1647‚Äì1717) who made six pilgrimages to Mecca and made each of these pilgrimages into a journey of several years. Sidi Ahmad bin Nasir traveled to Ethiopia, Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and Persia. During his travels he took the opportunity of establishing new branches of the Sufi brotherhood. He wrote a voluminous series of memoirs of his journeys called the Rihla (partly translated by A. Berbrugger in 1846) and he brought back numerous works from all parts of the Islamic world. The brotherhood decided, already in the 17th century to found a university of the Quran. That university received, right from the beginning, more than 1500 students from countries in the Middle-East and West Africa. When Ahmad bin Nasir died, the library (in Arabic the 'khizana habsia') of Tamegroute, with its thousands of manuscripts was one of the richest of North Africa. Some fine examples of the collection of manuscripts (now 4200) are still on display in the zawiya today and attract many tourists from Morocco and abroad. Among them are a 14th-century Quran with beautiful calligraphy in Kufic script, writings of Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), El Khwarizmi, a translation of Pythagoras, treatises on theology, astronomy, geography and pharmacology. Later sheikhs of the Sufi brotherhood of the Nasiriyya also played an important role as religious and cultural leaders and teachers of the Sufi doctrine (Tasawwuf). The 19th sheikh Abu Bekr is well-known, in the Draa valley (zawiya in Mhamid Ghuslan) and in the west through his encounters with the travelers Gerhard Rohlfs Gerhard Rohlfs, Mein erster Aufenthalt in Marokko und Reise s√ºdlich vom Atlas durch die Oasen Draa und Tafilet, Bremen, 1873, Chapter 15: Die Draa-Oase. Mordversuch auf den Reisenden. Ankunft in Algerien and Charles de Foucauld. The graves of eight marabouts attract the visit of patients from all parts of the country, some of which remain in Tamegroute for months and sometimes even for years, hoping for healing and redemption by the baraka of the Nasiriyya. In order to view the books at the library, a permit must be obtained from the Moroccan government, which allows you to handle the books inside the library only. The books collected by Ali Ben include texts on medicine, Qu'ranic learning and astrology, as well as mathematics and the sciences.cf. Gutelius, \\"Sufi networks and the Social Contexts for Scholarship in Morocco and the Northern Sahara, 1660‚Äì1830\\" The building of the zawiya, as it stands now with its green tiles, dates from 1869, when it was rebuilt after a fire. Moussem A month after the greatest Islam holy day of Aid el-Kebir, Tamegroute hosts the yearly Moussem (festival) honoring Sidi Muhammad bin Nasir. Pottery Pottery in Tamegroute The founders of the religious brotherhood Nasiriyya wanted to raise the status of the village of Tamegroute to that of a \\"Medina\\", that is to say to make it a city. They assembled the merchants and craftsmen that they had brought from Fes, a city that enjoyed good relations with Tamegroute at the time. However, today Tamegroute is a little village again, but the pottery has become its main characteristic. Except for a few ochre shades, a green glaze is the dominant colour in pottery from Tamegroute. As with Fes Zelliges, and even more so, the ancient techniques give the glaze infinite variations. Local institutions The outdoor weekly market (souk) is held on Saturdays in the city center, where you can admire all kinds of pottery List of weekly open-air markets in the province of Zagora Muhammad Awzal In the 17th century the famous Shilha (Berber) poet, Muhammad Awzal (1670‚Äì1748), found sanctuary in Tamegroute. His first work in Berber al-Hawd was written here. His last work An-Nasiha (\\"The Advice\\"), is an ode in praise of Sidi Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Nasir (1647‚Äì1717), Awzal's spiritual guide and grand master of the Nasiriyya Sufi order, probably inspired as a funeral eulogy by his death, around 1717. Another famous inhabitant of Tamegroute was Sidi Ahmad al-Tijani who joined the order of the Nasiriyya before establishing his own brotherhood.  Abu-l- Hasan Ali Ibn Mohammed al-Tamgruti Tamegroute was the place of birth of one of the most important officials of the Saadian court, the author and ambassador Abu-l-Hasan Ali Ibn Mohammed al-Tamgruti, best known because of the rihla of his journey to Istanbul in 1590‚Äì91 for Ahmad al-MansurTamegruti is the author of Al-Nafha al Miskiya fi al Sifara al Turkiya (Arabic title), (A 16th century travel account of Istanbul by a Moroccan ambassador), Keta-books, 2002 (French translation: Relation d'une ambassade marocaine en Turquie, 1589‚Äì1591, par Abou-l-Hasan Ali ben Mohammed et-Tamgrouti, traduite et annot√©e par Henry de Castries, Paris, 1929) Bibliography and external links * Ph.D. Thesis: \\"Between God and men : the Nasiriyya and economic life in Morocco, 1640‚Äì1830\\" by David Gutelius.

History On the 13th of April 1968, the Assyrian Universal Alliance was founded in Pau, France where the first congress was held. The AUA as a global organisation seeks to spread, uphold and enhance the Assyrian name in the world, to secure the human rights of the Assyrian people in their homeland and to attain an autonomous state in the Assyrian homeland. The AUA has held 28 world congresses in which representatives of the Assyrian federations, organizations and political parties have participated, voicing the concerns of their respective communities and partaking in directing the affairs of the nation. Each AUA World Congress has convened in a different country to strengthen the relation between the AUA, the Assyrians and the government of that host country. The AUA World Congress has been held in the US, Europe, Australia, Iran and Iraq. The AUA had not been able to hold its World Congress in Iraq, the Assyrian homeland, until 2010 in Erbil as the aspirations of the Assyrian people were in direct conflict with the policies of the ruling Baath regime, which continuously denied Assyrians their national identity and status as the indigenous people of Iraq and persisted in its attempts to Arabize them. The current Secretary-General of the AUA is Yonathan Betkolia, an Assyrian representative in the Iranian parliament. The current affiliates of the AUA include: the Assyrian National Congress of Georgia, Assyrian National Council of Iran, Assyrian Association of Armenia, Assyrian Australian National Federation and the Assyrian Federation of Russia.http://aua.net/affiliates/ After the inception of the AUA, a serious effort was undertaken to address the need of the Assyrian nation to have its own official flag. The worldwide effort netted a large number of designs which were presented in front of the AUA congress and a final design was approved at the 6th AUA congress in Yonkers, New York which was designed by Mr. George Bit-Atanus. Ideology The AUA does not see itself as a political party, rather as a collective that functions with political parties and leans towards appropriate institutions. The founding document of the AUA declares \\"Assyrian\\" as the \\"singular name for all members of our nation [umtan]\\" and lists the various churches of Syriac heritage. The AUA's founding principles are centred around: \\"One name for one nation, One language for one nation, One leadership for one nation, A homeland for one nation. UNPO On the 6th of August 1991, the Assyrian Universal Alliance became a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, representing Assyria.UNPO The AUA has continuously pushed for Assyrian rights during UNPO gatherings such as the General Assembly held in Taiwan, where the AUA presented the critical conditions of Assyrians living in Iraq and introduced a resolution that called the UNPO General Assembly to support an autonomous status (self-administered region) for Assyrians in Iraq.http://www.nineveh.com/A%20living%20history.html In August 1996, AUA delivered a statement to the UN sub-commission, voicing concerns over the discrimination against Assyrians in Northern Iraq as well as being deprived of preserving their identity. Thus, the AUA called for a civil administration to be put in place in Northern Iraq in order to provide the necessary services. In September 1996, an Assyrian delegation and the UNPO met with the assistant to the UN Special Rapporteur on Iraq to brief him on the situation of Assyrians. John J. Nimrod, former secretary-general of the AUA, served as chairman of the UNPO General Assembly from 1992-2004. Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation The Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation (AUAF), a non-profit organization, was established in Chicago in 1978 as a response to the mass migration of Assyrian refugees to the United States, with the intent to assist with the resettlement process. AUAF has since expanded its mission beyond social services to include humanitarian relief efforts, as well as educational and cultural programs. AUAF has developed multiple community programs such as a Fine Arts Program that identifies talented Assyrian Americans and engage their talents to become effective leaders, tutoring services for Assyrians in secondary school, scholarships, and the Ashurbanipal Library which was founded in the 1980s and is home to the largest and most extensive collection of Assyrian texts in the world.

It was founded in 1917 as a ‚Äúmagazine of Michigan history for Michigan people by Michigan writers.‚Äù Since then, it has expanded into a full-color, 68-page international publication with a subscription base of over 20,000 and a total readership of nearly 100,000. The magazine is published six times a year and offered either as an individual subscription or an enhancement to a membership with the Historical Society of Michigan. History Michigan History magazine traces its roots to the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Collections, an annual, single-volume publication first published in 1874 by the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society. With the publication of Volume 40 in 1916, the Pioneer Collections ceased production. The following year, the Michigan Historical Commission, organized in 1913, and the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society (now known as the Historical Society of Michigan) introduced the quarterly publication Michigan History. Early issues contained essays on subjects in Michigan history, biographical sketches, state historical news, reports from county and local historical societies, and the activities of schools and clubs doing work in Michigan history. The magazine also included the plans and progresses of the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society as well as the Michigan Historical Commission, which had been organized as a state government department of history and archives. For the next sixty years, Michigan History served as a traditionally academic quarterly publication, continuing to offer scholarly essays, book reviews, and news items. In 1965, the Society ceased its involvement with the publication of the magazine, and in 1972, the newly created Division of Michigan History, a division of the Michigan Department of State, took over the magazine's publication. This was done in conjunction with the Commission, which served as an advisory board to the Division. Under the State Department, the journal converted to a popular magazine format and became a bimonthly publication beginning in 1978. The Division of Michigan History was renamed the Michigan Historical Center in 1995 and transferred from the Department of State to the newly created Department of History, Arts, and Libraries in October 2001. In July 2009, Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm issued Executive Order 2009-36, which terminated the Department of History, Arts, and Libraries and directed that Michigan History be transferred to a nonprofit society or foundation. On October 1, 2009 the magazine moved to the Historical Society of Michigan, a non-governmental nonprofit‚Äîthe same organization that had been involved in producing the publication from its founding through 1965. The Society, led by Executive Director and CEO Larry J. Wagenaar, then established the subsidiary Michigan History Magazine L3C. As former editorial staff did not move with the magazine, Patricia Majher was announced as Editor in fall 2009. Along with Assistant Editor Maria Taylor, Majher oversaw a major redesign of the magazine in January 2016. With Majher's departure in May 2016, the Society reorganized its editorial staff into a new group that would oversee the organization's three major magazines: Michigan History, Chronicle, and Michigan History for Kids. The current editorial staff of Michigan History includes Nancy Feldbush as Editor in Chief, Emily Allison as Features Editor, Amy Wagenaar as Multimedia Manager, and Emily Elliott as Editorial Assistant. Graphic design is accomplished through a pool of graphic artists and internal staff. HSM Executive Director Larry J. Wagenaar continues to serve as the magazine's publisher. On July 1, 2016 the subsidiary Michigan History Magazine L3C was dissolved by the Society's Board of Trustees and Michigan History was merged into the main operations of the Historical Society of Michigan. Content Each issue of Michigan History provides readers with engaging stories about Michigan's past, both known and unknown. Michigan's rich diversity is often highlighted, as is the impact that the Great Lakes state has made on both national and international communities. Feature stories are typically authored by outside writers and historians who possess knowledge in Michigan's social, cultural, political, economic, architectural, and institutional history. Other special sections include news items involving Michigan societies, museums, and organizations; personal recollections entitled Remember the Time; milestones of historical Michigan institutions; book summaries; happenings at the Historical Society of Michigan; travel destinations as featured in HSM's Historic Michigan Travel Guide; and featured photography.

Biography  Eznik was born at Koghb (Tuzluca), in the historical province of Tayk, a tributary valley of the Chorokh, in Northern Greater Armenia. He was a pupil of Isaac the Great of Armenia and of Saint Mesrop. At their request he went first to Edessa, then to Constantinople to perfect himself in the various sciences and to collect or copy Syriac and Greek manuscripts of the Bible, and the writings of the Fathers of the Church. He returned to Armenia after the First Council of Ephesus (431). He is probably identical with Eznik, Bishop of Bagrevand region, who took part in the Synod of Artashat in 449.  Works  In addition to his labors in connection with the new version of the Bible and various translations, he composed several works, the principal of which is his remarkable apologetic treatise \\"Against the Sects\\" or \\"On God\\". It was written between 441 and 449, and contains four parts: *In the first, against the heathens, Eznik combats the eternity of matter and the substantial existence of evil. *In the second he refutes the chief doctrines of Parseeism/Zoroastrianism (particularly Zurvanism. *The third is directed against aspects of the beliefs of the Greek philosophers (Pythagoreans, Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics and Epicureans). This is the only section in which Eznik takes his arguments from the Bible rather than from reason. *The fourth book is an exposition and refutation of Marcionism as a dualist heresy. An essential theme of the work is on the importance of free will in Christian theology. Eznik displays much acumen and an extensive erudition. Eznik was evidently as familiar with the Persian language (Middle Persian) as with Greek literature. His Armenian diction is of the choicest classical type, although the nature of his subject matter forced him to use quite a number of Greek words. The book also contains many interesting asides, such as Eznik's refutation of astrologyEznik's Refutation of the Astrologers (Sophene Armeniaca) and his diversion to the topic of animal behavior and psychology.Eznik on Foresight (Sophene Armeniaca) The original manuscript of \\"Against the Sects\\" is lost: The work survived due to a single medieval transcription copied at the University of Gladzor. This manuscript is currently at the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts. A copy of the first printing of \\"Against the Sects\\" as a book in Smyrna (now Izmir) in 1762 is in the collection at the British Library.The British Library The Mechitarists at Venice published an updated edition in 1826 and again in 1865.

The spelling of the name, over the centuries has changed from Tyne and Tynen to Thien, Tienen, Thinen and finally Thienen. The barons of Thienen- Adlerflycht are the only branch of this family still existing; they belong to the high nobility of Denmark.  History  In his 1670 published work Insignia et tabula Genealogica dominorum a Thinen, the genealogist Johann Daniel Eberus describes that the family of Thienen was expelled from Holstein in the beginning of the 9th Century by Charlemagne. As a consequence, the family fled to Brabant (today's Belgium) and there founded the city Thienen or Tienen (French: Tirlemont). However, at least one branch of the family returned around 1000 AD and stayed in Dithmarschen until 1280, when they were expelled again. Some members of the family fought against the people of Dithmarschen as knights in 1289, 1322 and 1404. The first completely provable documentation of the family is the Knight Heneke of Thienen, born in 1270, in 1314. The barons of Thienen-Adlerflycht are among the nine extant Equites Originarii, the ancient noble families (Uradel) of Schleswig-Holstein. Today's head of the family is Franz Baron of Thienen-Adlerflycht (born 1957).  Two important manor houses built by the Thienen family  Various castles and manor houses were built by the Thienen family over the last centuries, the following two are from special cultural importance. The former moated castle Wahlstorf was built in the 15th century by Detlev of Thienen and his son Claus. It is one of the oldest still existing manor houses of Schleswig- Holstein. After more than 320 years in family ownership, in 1788 the Plessen family inherited it. The castle of G√ºldenstein has been built in 1726 by Heinrich of Thienen. The moated castle is located on an oval island, it is well known as a main example of baroque architecture in Schleswig-Holstein. It is owned by the dukes of Oldenburg since 1839.  Barons of Thienen- Adlerflycht  The only still existing branch of the family received the title of Danish barons in 1840 (as Barons of Thienen-Adlerflycht). The connection of the names Thienen and Adlerflycht arose due to the marriage of Conrad Christoph of Thienen with Luise of Adlerflycht, the last, of an ancient noble family that originated from Sweden. Conrad Christoph and Luise emigrated from Schleswig-Holstein. Their son Karl baron of Thienen-Adlerflycht was the diplomatic representative of the Danish king and several German principalities and duchies in Vienna. Since then the barons of Thienen-Adlerflycht live in Austria.

Progress Avenue has two major intersections: I-81 (Exit 69), US 22. Major intersections for local roads are with Union Deposit Road in Susquehanna Township and Elmerton Avenue near Harrisburg. Its northern terminus is at Pennsylvania Route 39. Until 1955, Progress Avenue was also Pennsylvania Route 543. Route description SR 3015 begins in the borough of Paxtang, at Derry Street. The borough is just outside the city of Harrisburg. The intersection of SR 3015 and Derry Street is the center of Paxtang. While SR 3015 ends at this intersection, the road continues straight, going through a park, and ending at Paxton Street, near the Harrisburg Mall, a distance of about a mile. In Paxtang, the road is known as Paxtang Avenue. Once outside the borough limits, it becomes Progress Avenue, which it remains all the way to the northern terminus of SR 3015. The first intersection is with Union Deposit Road, near the Harrisburg city limits. Union Deposit Road is State Route 3020, and was at one time a section Pennsylvania Route 340. SR 3015 continues north to US 22. This is a heavily traveled intersection, with an Annual average daily traffic report of over an average of 22,500 vehicles a day, traveling on US 22 and an average of 15,500 vehicles traveling on SR 3015. The road continues north, intersecting SR 3026, Elmerton Avenue near Harrisburg. Interstate 81 is less than a mile away, on the other side of a hill. When Interstate 81 was built, this exit was a small exit, but the area has since been built up with an office park, restaurants, a hotel, and a strip shopping center. The exit on I-81 is Exit 69, and the exit ramps are designated State Route 8005. SR 3015 continues north through a series of hills - the foothills of nearby Blue Mountain. Between I-81 and Pennsylvania Route 39, there are no major intersections; the road is mostly straight, whereas the previous section of road had curves in it. At PA 39 is the northern terminus of SR 3015; Progress Avenue continues north into developments that have been built in the 2000s. Progress Avenue runs another one and a half miles before ending at Continental Drive. History right Until 1955, Progress Avenue was Pennsylvania Route 543. It was a spur of Pennsylvania Route 43, which ran on modern US 22 (Walnut Street, at its intersection with SR 3015), while US 22 was routed on Derry Street. In the mid 1930s, US 22 was moved from Derry Street to its current location on Walnut Street, and PA 43 was deleted. The route became orphaned from its parent once that happened, and when Pennsylvania cleaned up the road designations in 1955, PA 543 was deleted. However, the road remained under state funding, receiving a legislative route number. In 1987, when Pennsylvania instituted the Location Referencing System, the road was given its current designation SR 3015.

He was the Chief Cabinet Secretary under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe from 2012 to 2020 and Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications from 2006 to 2007. Born to a family of strawberry farmers in rural Akita Prefecture, Suga moved to Tokyo after graduating from high school, where he enrolled in Hosei University. Shortly after graduating with a Bachelor of Laws, Suga became an aide to Representative Hikosaburo Okonogi in 1975 before entering politics himself when he was elected to the Yokohama Municipal Assembly in 1987. In the 1996 election, Suga was elected to the House of Representatives, representing Kanagawa's 2nd District as a member of the LDP. During his time in the Diet, Suga became a close ally of Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe. When Abe first became Prime Minister in 2006, he appointed Suga to the Cabinet as Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications. After the LDP won the 2012 general election, Suga was appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary, a role Suga would hold throughout Abe's second tenure as Prime Minister. He is the longest-serving Chief Cabinet Secretary in Japanese history. In September 2020, after Abe announced his retirement from politics, Suga declared his candidacy in the LDP leadership election. Widely considered the frontrunner, Suga comfortably won the election on 14 September with 70% of the vote. Two days later, he was formally elected Prime Minister by the Diet and appointed by Emperor Naruhito, making him the first new Prime Minister of the Reiwa era. Suga has stated that his premiership will focus on continuing the policies and goals of the Abe administration, including the Abenomics suite of economics policies, the revision of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, and securing the release of Japanese abductees from North Korea.  Early life and education  Suga was born to a family of strawberry farmers in Ogachi (now Yuzawa), a rural area in Akita Prefecture, and moved to Tokyo after graduation from Yuzawa High School. He attended night school to obtain a Bachelor of Laws from Hosei University in 1973. Suga chose Hosei \\"because it was the cheapest option available\\" and he \\"worked in a cardboard factory in Tokyo to pay his tuition\\".  Political career  Suga with alt= After graduating from university, Suga worked on a House of Councillors (upper house) election campaign, and thereafter worked as secretary to LDP Diet Member Hikosaburo Okonogi, father of LDP politician Hachiro Okonogi, for eleven years. Suga resigned from this position in October 1986 to pursue his own career in politics. He was elected to the Yokohama City Council in April 1987, campaigning door-to-door on foot, visiting as many as 30,000 houses and wearing through six pairs of shoes. He pioneered the practice of giving campaign speeches in front of busy train stations, which is now common among Japanese political candidates. Despite being a young councilor, Suga presided over the highest levels of government, which earned him the nickname \\"the shadow mayor.\\" Representative Suga was elected to the Diet of Japan in the 1996 general election, representing the Kanagawa 2nd district. In his third year in the Diet, he shifted his support from Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to former LDP Secretary-General Seiroku Kajiyama, an unusual move for a junior legislator. He was re-elected in the 2000 general election, 2003 general election, and 2005 general election. He was appointed Senior Vice Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications in November 2005 under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He was promoted to Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications and Minister for Privatization of the Postal Services in the first Shinzo Abe cabinet in September 2006, and added the portfolio of Minister of State for Decentralization Reform in December 2006. He was instrumental in the development of Japan's system, which allowed taxpayers to obtain deductions by donating money to local governments. He was replaced by Hiroya Masuda in a cabinet reshuffle in August 2007. His \\"street-corner\\" campaigning style was credited with holding his seat in the 2009 general election, when many other LDP lawmakers lost their seats amid a surge in support for the Democratic Party of Japan. In October 2011, he was appointed Chairman of the LDP Party Organization and Campaign Headquarters. In September 2012, he was appointed Executive Acting Secretary-General of the LDP. As a Diet member, Suga built a power base among legislators not affiliated with the party's factions, particularly a group of young first-generation lawmakers known as the \\"Ganesha group.\\"  Chief Cabinet Secretary  Suga (right) shaking hands with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman in 2013 Suga (third from right) at the announcement of the Okinawa Consolidation Plan in 2013 Suga remained close to Shinzo Abe during the late 2000s and early 2010s, and urged Abe to run for the LDP presidency in 2012. Unlike many of Abe's other allies, Suga pushed Abe to focus on the economy rather than Abe's long-standing ambition to revise Article 9 of the Constitution, which prohibits Japan from using a military as means of settling international disputes. Following Abe's victory in the 2012 general election, Suga was appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary in the second Abe cabinet in December 2012. In September 2014, he was given the additional portfolio of Minister in charge of Alleviating the Burden of the Bases in Okinawa. Suga and Tar≈ç As≈ç were the only members of the December 2012 cabinet who remained in the cabinet as of November 2019. Suga is by far the longest- serving Chief Cabinet Secretary in Japanese history, serving his post for a total of 2,820 days; the second longest-serving Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, served for a total of 1,289 days, less than half as long as Suga. As Chief Cabinet Secretary, Suga served as an aide and advisor to Abe, and took an active managerial role in the government. He had a key role in the government's initiatives to attract tourists and foreign workers and reduce mobile telephone rates. He formed a team to reexamine the lead-up to the Kono Statement of 1993 but the group was soon after disbanded without ever reaching a consensus. He was affiliated with the openly nationalist organisation Nippon Kaigi.\\"Abe‚Äôs reshuffle promotes right-wingers\\" ‚Äì Korea Joongang Daily ‚Äì 2014/09/05 Under Abe, Suga overcame party resistance to implement a visa program that opened the doors for unskilled foreign workers, a shift from the previous policy, which centered on internship programs that often confined foreign workers to low-paying jobs. He was also supportive of the aggressive measures by the Bank of Japan to counter deflation. In 2015, he was criticized for publicly encouraging Japanese women to \\"contribute to their country by feeling like they want to have more children\\". He continued to hold his seat in the 2014 general election and 2017 general election. Suga gained domestic and international fame when he announced the name of the new imperial era, Reiwa, on 1 April 2019, earning him the nickname \\"Uncle Reiwa\\" (Reiwa Ojisan). While he had previously been a low-profile member of the government, this honor gave him an instant surge in name recognition and led more LDP lawmakers to view him as a viable candidate for party leadership. He was sent to Washington in May 2019 for a meeting with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other senior officials, fueling speculation that he was being groomed to serve as Abe's successor. Suga faced scrutiny later that year due to the resignations of Cabinet ministers Katsuyuki Kawai and Isshu Sugawara, both of whom had been close associates of Suga and were accused of campaign financing violations. Suga also remained politically active during this time, coordinating support for the LDP candidate in the 2019 Hokkaido gubernatorial election, a role typically reserved for top LDP officials.Suga announcing the new imperial era name \\"Reiwa\\" on 1 April 2019Suga served as a key Abe deputy during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. He criticized the structure of the Japanese bureaucracy, with deep divisions between ministries, as stalling coordination to stop the spread of the virus.  Prime Minister of Japan  Following Shinzo Abe's resignation announcement in August 2020, Suga emerged as the leading contender to replace Abe on the leadership election, having gained the support of Deputy Prime Minister Tar≈ç As≈ç and LDP Secretary- General Toshihiro Nikai, as well as the two largest factions in the LDP and supposedly even Abe himself. Suga's main competitors in the LDP leadership race were longtime Abe rival Shigeru Ishiba and LDP policy chief Fumio Kishida. Suga was elected to the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party on 14 September 2020, with 377 votes out of a total of 534. Upon his election, Suga outlined a policy agenda that included tackling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and implementing further deregulation to revitalize the economy. He reiterated his past interest in consolidating regional banks and lowering mobile phone charges in Japan. Suga vowed to continue the economic policies of his predecessor, known as Abenomics, and to continue the path of Shinzo Abe in terms of foreign policy, making his \\"top priority\\" the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. He and his cabinet were sworn in on 16 September 2020. In October 2020, Suga made his first trips abroad to Vietnam and Indonesia, with analysts saying that he chose those two countries amid the growing tensions between one of its closest allies, the United States, and China. Suga also vowed to strengthen ties with Southeast Asian countries and is expected to sign an agreement allowing his government to export defense equipment and technology to Vietnam.  Personal life  Suga is married and has three sons. His wife, Mariko, is the sister of one of his former co- workers in the office of Hikosaburo Okonogi. Suga has a daily fitness routine, which includes doing 100 situps and 40 minutes of walking each morning, and 100 situps each night. He started this routine after a doctor advised him to lose weight, and he lost in four months. He is also known as a voracious reader, and is known for reading all major newspapers daily despite his busy schedule. Suga practiced karate when he was a college student. He holds the third dan black belt. Suga never drinks alcohol, and is known to have a sweet tooth. His favorite food is pancakes. His lunch is almost always soba. He neither smokes nor drinks.

Longstreth, a graduate of Princeton University, was an eighth-generation Philadelphian born to Quakers William Collins (b. 1882) and Nella ( Thacher) Longstreth, who married in 1917. William C. Longstreth owned the Longstreth Motor Car Company and his family lived in Haverford, Pennsylvania, and was affluent until the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Thacher was a cousin of President Herbert Hoover and his maternal grandmother, Ella Hoover Thacher was the president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union for many years. In 1970, he led the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and spearheaded the drive to hold the annual Earth Day commemoration in Philadelphia. That event became one of the biggest Earth Day events in the nation. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Greater Delaware Valley Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He was predeceased by his half sister, Nella Cameron Downward (1913-1997). His younger brother, Frank Hoover Longstreth (b. 1922) died in 2008. He was a two-time Republican nominee for Mayor of Philadelphia, first in 1955, losing to Richardson Dilworth, and again in 1971, losing to Frank Rizzo. He was initially elected to Philadelphia's City Council in 1967, resigning his seat to run for Mayor in 1971. While a member of City Council, he served as a sideline reporter on Philadelphia Eagles radio broadcasts on WIP in 1969 and 1970. Longstreth was again elected to Council in 1983, defeating incumbent councilwoman Beatrice Chernock for the at-large seat he had vacated twelve years earlier to run for Mayor. He would remain in office until his death. During his tenure on Council, Longstreth helped support the efforts of Edmund Bacon to bring an urban renaissance to Philadelphia. He was also well known for wearing bow ties and argyle socks. He suffered from Parkinson's disease, and died of a pulmonary embolism while on vacation in Naples, Florida.

A reference number is introduced, which defines the total impulse, Itot, delivered by the system, divided by the system mass, mPS: :Issp=Itot/mPS Because of the resulting dimension, - delivered impulse per kilogram of system mass mPS, this number is called ‚ÄòSystem-specific Impulse‚Äô. In SI units, impulse is measured in newton-seconds (N¬∑s) and Issp in N¬∑s/kg. The Issp allows a more accurate determination of the propulsive performance of jet propulsion systems than the commonly used Specific Impulse, Isp, which only takes into account the propellant and the thrust engine performance characteristics. Therefore, the Issp permits an objective and comparative performance evaluation of systems of different designs and with different propellants. The Issp can be derived directly from actual jet propulsion systems by determining the total impulse delivered by the mass of contained propellant, divided by the known total (wet) mass of the propulsion system. This allows a quantitative comparison of for example, built systems. In addition, the Issp can be derived analytically, for example for spacecraft propulsion systems, in order to facilitate a preliminary selection of systems (chemical, electrical) for spacecraft missions of given impulse and velocity-increment requirements. A more detailed presentation of derived mathematical formulas for Issp and their applications for spacecraft propulsion is given below.\\"Performance Evaluation of Spacecraft Propulsion Systems in Relation to Mission Impulse Requirements\\" See also *Specific Impulse Notes References (1) Peter Erichsen; \\"Performance Evaluation of Spacecraft Propulsion Systems in Relation to Mission Impulse Requirements\\"; Proceedings of the Second European Spacecraft Propulsion Conference, 27‚Äì29 May 1997 (ESA SP-398, Aug. 1997).

History The MacDonalds The castle was an old seat of the Mormaers and Earls of Ross, chiefs of Clan Ross. It was later held by their successors, the Clan Donald Earls of Ross. Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh, chief of the Clan MacDonald of Lochalsh and a relative of the MacDonald Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles, held a Christmas feast at Balconie in 1485. He invited all of the dependents of his own clan and many of the most powerful Highland chieftains. Kenneth Mackenzie arrived at the feast with 40 men but without his MacDonald wife which insulted the MacDonalds. To make matters worse as there was not enough room in Balconie, Kenneth was provided lodgings in the kiln and in a fit of anger he hit out at one of the Macleans of Duart who had made the accommodation arrangements. This was seen by the servants as a deliberate insult against the MacDonald chief and they took up arms against Kenneth Mackenzie and his companions who made a quick retreat. The Munros From the late 15th to the end of the 17th century the castle was held by a cadet branch of the Clan Munro; the Munros of Coul and Balconie, who descend from George Munro 10th Baron of Foulis Castle, chief of the clan. Balconie Castle's owners were chronologically; John Munro 1st, John Mor Munro 2nd, John Munro 3rd, Hugh Munro 4th, Robert Munro 5th, Donald Munro 6th and John Munro 7th, all of Balconie. John Munro, 7th of Balconie sold the lands. Modern history Later the castle went through a period of Mackenzie ownership and an interlude of Fraser ownership in the 19th century which saw the nearby village of Evanton laid out. See:Evan Fraser of Balconie. Alterations and additions were documented in 1891 by architects Andrew Maitland & Sons. By the start of the Second World War, the castle was owned by one George Bankes and used as a summer home. During the War, the building was requisitioned by the army and used as a billet. After the war, the castle was bought by A.J.M. Munro, a timber merchant from Alness, and lay empty for some years, dry rot being only one of the problems. It fell into disrepair and by the 1960s was unsafe. Local children were prone to explore the place and to prevent a serious accident, it was demolished. The rubble was used in the construction of the new aluminium smelter a few miles away at Invergordon. Nothing is left of the building - it is just a field. A small ice-house remains. The location was approximately . However, the castle's walled garden and stables survive and is privately owned by a Maclean family. { Castle and Walled Gardens Garden and Stables Garden walkway } References * Interview with Alastair and Mora Munro 11 June 2007 Category:Castles in Highland (council area) Category:Ross and Cromarty Category:Clan Munro ","title":"Balconie Castle"},{"id":"7162469","text":"Brown Hornet may refer to: *Brown Hornet, a colloquial term for the European hornet *The Brown Hornet the cartoon superhero ","title":"Brown Hornet"},{"id":"7162480","text":"The Sugarloaf Key Bat Tower, also known as the Perky Bat Tower, is a historic site in Monroe County, Florida, United States.

Thomas Henry Burke was Permanent Under-Secretary at the Irish Office for many years while Augustus Nicholas Burke was an artist. The family seat was Glinsk Castle, near Ballymoe, County Galway. The Burke Baronetcy, of Marble Hill in the County of Galway, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 5 December 1797 for Thomas Burke. He raised an infantry regiment at his own expense during the Napoleonic Wars. The second and third Baronets both sat as Members of Parliament for County Galway. The fifth Baronet served as High Sheriff of County Galway in 1883. The seventh Baronet was a Deputy Lieutenant of County Galway. Three other members of the family may also be mentioned. Charles Granby Burke (1814‚Äì1898), second son of the second Baronet, was Master of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) from 1852 to 1882.

On June 23, 1994, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The kraals were fenced-in holding pens adjacent to the cannery in a sheltered bay at the north end of town, where turtles were kept awaiting slaughter. The once-fashionable turtle meat was canned and sold to cooks who used it largely to make turtle soup. The valuable Tortoiseshell was used to make many kinds of products made today from plastic. The building is owned by the City of Key West, and currently houses exhibits from the nearby Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Museum.

It is located at 600 White Street. In 1971, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places. The armory was built to support military training and readiness of local military reserves. In 1877, the \\"Key West Rifles\\", a voluntary military company, organized with 80 members. It was not very professional, and after the fire of 1886 destroyed all of its equipment, it ceased to exist. In 1888, a 32-member company named the \\"Island City Guards\\" was organized, which would eventually become Company 1, Second Regiment of Infantry, Florida State Troops. It is now part of the National Guard. (Excerpt from \\"Key West: The Old and the New\\" (1912) by Jefferson B. Browne) Land for an armory was purchased by Monroe County in 1901. The armory was designed by T. F. Russell and built in 1901 by John T. Sawyer. In 1903, upon a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court, the state of Florida refunded the cost to the county and took ownership. With . In 2006, it became the home and initial campus of The Studios of Key West, a new artist community offering creative space, professional workshops, and other creative and cultural activities. After The Studios of Key West moved to their new headquarters, at 533 Eaton Street, in 2015, The Armory eventually became home to 12 artist studios. 'Artists at the Armory' are located on the second floor. The main hall is available for lease and is often used as a rehearsal space by local theater companies or as an exhibition space. The Historic Florida Keys Foundation (HFKF) leases the Armory from the State of Florida. The HFKF manages the Armory and oversees its maintenance.

Life John Gordon was the natural son of Alexander Gordon (c. 1516-1575), Bishop of Galloway and former Archbishop of Glasgow, and Barbara Logie; his parents married, perhaps clandestinely, only in 1546, before Alexander obtained ecclesiastical preferment (for this, see his new DNB entry). Gordon first studied at St Leonard's College, St. Andrews. In June 1565 he was sent to pursue his education in France, having a yearly pension granted him by Mary, Queen of Scots, payable out of her French dowry. He spent two years at the universities of Paris and Orleans. On 4 January 1568 he was confirmed by royal charter in the bishopric of Galloway and abbacy of Tongland, vacated in his favour by his father; the charter specifies his skill in classical and oriental tongues. At this time he was in France, in the service of the Protestant leader, Prince Louis of Conde, but he soon came to England, entered the service of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, and attended him at the conferences of York (October 1568) and Westminster (November 1568), held for the purpose of considering Mary's guilt. When Norfolk was sent to the Tower (October 1569), Gordon transferred his services to Mary herself, and seems to have remained with her till January 1572, when she was deprived of her household. Mary commended him to the French king, and he enjoyed the post of gentleman ordinary of the privy chamber to Charles IX, Henry III, and Henry IV, with a yearly pension of four hundred crowns. He saved the lives of several countrymen at the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, but never renounced Protestantism. In 1574 he exhibited his Hebrew learning in a public disputation at Avignon with the chief rabbi Benetrius. By his marriage in 1576 with Antoinette, widowed daughter of Rene de Marolles, he acquired an estate which gave him the style of \\"Sieur of Longorme\\". With the see of Galloway his connection was never more than nominal, the revenues going to his father or to his brother George. Gordon is mentioned in 1588 as Bishop of Galloway; but he resigned his rights before 8 July 1586. His first wife died in 1591. He married in 1594 a strong Protestant, Genevieve, daughter of Fran√ßois Petau, sieur of Maulette. On 18 July 1594 in Paris, he signs the marriage contract between Suzanne Hotman and her first husband John Menteith, calling himself \\"Gentleman of the Bedchamber of the King [and] Seigneur of Boullay-Thierry\\". In 1601 he was selected by the Duchess of Lorraine, sister of Henry IV, to take part with Daniel Tilenus and Pierre Du Moulin in a public disputation against Du Perron (afterwards cardinal), who had been charged with the task of converting her to the Roman Catholic Church. On the accession of James I to the English throne (1603), Gordon published in French and English a strongly Protestant panegyric of congratulation and, in the same year, a piece in Latin elegiacs addressed to Prince Henry. James called him to England and nominated him in October to the deanery of Salisbury, whereupon he was ordained in his 59th year. He was present at the Hampton Court conference in January 1604 as \\"deane of Sarum\\",' though he was not confirmed until 24 February. In the second day's conference, James singled him out \\"with a speciall encomion, that he was a man well trauailled in the auncients.\\" He approved of the ring in marriage, but doubted the cross in baptism. Gordon preached often at court and, among the \\"pulpit-occurrents\\" of 28 April 1605, it is mentioned that \\"Deane Gordon, preaching before the kinge, is come so farre about in matter of ceremonies, the out of Ezechiell and other places of the prophets, and by certain hebrue characters, and other cabalisticall collections, he hath founde out and approved the vse of the crosse cap surplis et ct.\\" During James' visit to Oxford in 1605 he was created a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) on 13 August \\"because he was to dispute before the king his kinsman.\\" He is described as of Balliol College. His second wife Genevieve Petau de Maulette taught French to Princess Elizabeth (1596‚Äì1662), afterwards queen of Bohemia. In 1611 the barony of Glenluce, which had belonged to his brother Lawrence, was bestowed on him by royal charter. During the ten years 1603-13 Gordon produced a number of quartos notable for obscure learning, Protestant fervour, controversial elegiacs, and prophetic anticipations drawn from the wildest etymologies. He was assiduous in his ecclesiastical duties, which included a quasi-episcopal supervision of some eighty parishes. He procured an act of the chapter devoting one-fifth of the revenue of every prebend for seven years to cathedral repairs. While on a triennial visitation he died at Lewston House, Dorset, in his seventy-fifth year. He was buried on 6 September in the morning chapel of his cathedral, where an inscribed stone marks his grave. Legacy On the north wall of the choir there was a brass (which no longer exists) \\"bearing the figure of a bishop, raised from his tomb by two angels\\", with a long biographical epitaph in Latin (given in the 1723 history of the cathedral). The dean assigned the barony of Glenluce with all his French property to Sir Robert Gordon, whom he made his literary executor. He left books to the cathedral library, and a legacy for rebuilding the cloisters.

The novel is the first of a seven-book saga about the fortunes of a retail empire and the machinations of the business elite across three generations. The series, featuring Emma Harte and her family also includes Hold The Dream, To Be The Best, Emma's Secret, Unexpected Blessings, Just Rewards and Breaking the Rules. A Woman of Substance was adapted as an eponymous television miniseries as were the sequels Hold the Dream and To Be the Best. Plot summary The book starts with an elderly Emma Harte flying to New York with her personal assistant and favourite grandchild, Paula. Emma contemplates the empire she has created. She has trained Paula to be her successor, both as the head of Harte Stores and as representative of her mother, Daisy Amory, at Sitex. On their arrival in New York, Emma's secretary, Gaye, tells her she heard Emma's sons discussing a plan to force her to retire and break up her empire so the pieces can be sold. Devastated initially, Emma isn't surprised but changes her will, choosing to leave her business interests to her grandchildren instead. The story then goes back to when Emma was a teenage servant at Fairley Hall, in rural Yorkshire. Her father, Jack, and two brothers, Winston and Frank, also work for the Fairley family. Jack and Frank work at the mill, and Winston works at the brickyard. After the death of his mother, Winston joins the navy, as he had wanted to since he was a child. As parlour maid, Emma sees a lot of the Fairley family and becomes friends with the younger son, Edwin. They bond over the deaths of their mothers. Emma also meets Blackie O'Neill, a wandering Irish navvy who has been hired to do some work at Fairley Hall, and they become fast friends. One day, Emma and Edwin realise they feel more for each other than friendship. Their friendship becomes intimate, and Emma gets pregnant. Edwin, horrified at this news, does not offer to marry her, so she runs away to Leeds. Wanting to protect herself and her child from gossip, Emma tells her landlady and new friends she is married to Winston, a sailor currently away at sea. While looking for work, she meets Abraham Kallinski and rescues him from an anti-semitic attack by local youths. After she gets rid of them, she sees Abraham is unwell and walks him home. He introduces her to his wife, Janessa, and sons, David and Victor. Janessa, out of gratitude, invites Emma to stay for dinner. When Emma tells them she is looking for work, Abraham immediately offers her a job at his clothing workshop. He and David are pleased with Emma's work, and she becomes good friends with them. As Emma's baby's birth approaches, Blackie arranges for her to meet his friend Laura Spencer in the village of Armley. Laura needs someone to share household expenses, and Emma needs someone to look after her, so the match seems ideal. The women become good friends, Emma moves in, and Laura gets her a job at Thompson's Mill. In March, Emma has a daughter and names her Edwina. As Emma must work to support herself and her child, Emma's cousin, Freda, takes Edwina. After a year of working two jobs, Emma makes enough money to rent a shop in Armley. This shop is a success, and Emma's business expands to a second shop, then a third. Not expecting to see the Fairleys, she is horrified when Edwin's brutish brother Gerald visits; he had found her after seeing she worked at Thompson's Mill, now owned by his father. He tells her Edwin will soon be engaged and demands she tell him where the child is. Emma refuses to admit there is a child, and after a violent confrontation, realizes she needs someone to protect her. Worried Gerald will return, she marries her landlord, Joe Lowther. (They had become friends when he taught her how to do her own accounts.) Soon after their marriage, he and Emma have a son, Christopher, nicknamed Kit. Emma's business continues to expand, with Emma going into business with the Kallinskis. Unfortunately, her private life doesn't run as smoothly. Joe is killed in the Battle of the Somme and Laura, now married to Blackie, dies giving birth to a son, Bryan. Emma raises Bryan until Blackie returns from the war. In early 1918, Emma meets Paul McGill. They fall in love, and while their time together is short, it is a very intense affair. Paul is in the Australian army and returns to France after recovering from a leg injury. After the war, he goes home and, despite promising to write, never does. Emma, hurt and disappointed, especially when she discovers he and his wife have a son, turns to an acquaintance for consolation and marries again. She and her new husband have twins, Robin and Elizabeth, but the marriage is unhappy and ends when Paul returns. (Emma' husband, Arthur Ainsley, may be homosexual and certainly has a drinking problem.) Paul has kept in touch with Emma's brother Frank, who informs him that Emma's marriage is unhappy. At Paul's request, Frank arranges a meeting between Emma and Paul. Emma is initially angry but calms down when Paul explains why he never wrote to her. They start dating again, and she divorces her husband when she finds out she is pregnant with Paul's child. Emma has a daughter, whom they name Daisy after Paul's mother. In February 1939, seeing war on the horizon, Paul goes to Australia to get his affairs in order, as he anticipates that once war starts travel will be difficult if not impossible. While there, he is seriously injured in a car crash and almost dies. He survives but is disfigured, and is told he will be dead within a year. He redraws his will, leaving almost everything to Emma and Daisy, and commits suicide. Emma is devastated but eventually recovers enough to look after her family and business empires. Emma's life goes on. Her children marry and have children of their own: Edwina marries Lord Jeremy Standish and has a son Anthony; Kit has a daughter Sarah; Robin has a son Jonathan; Elizabeth marries repeatedly, resulting in son Alexander, daughter Emily, and twins Amanda and Francesca; Daisy marries David Amory and has two children, Philip and Paula. Back in 1968, Emma invites her family to her house in Yorkshire for the weekend. They come, curious to see how she is after having recovered from pneumonia. She tells them she has discovered their treachery and outmaneuvered them by changing her will. Her older children are furious, but each accepts a one million pound trust that Emma offers as a bribe to not cause trouble. Her grandchildren are pleased, and all promise to run their section well. Emma also gives her blessing to Paula's becoming involved with Jim Fairley. He is Edwin's grandson, and Emma tells him Edwina is his aunt, but he had guessed, seeing her resemblance to his great-grandmother, Adele. Jim also has a surprise for Emma; he gives her a stone she and Edwin found and reveal the woman painted on it was Emma's mother, Elizabeth. Jim tells Emma about the history of brief but tragic relationships between Fairley men and Harte women, and relates that on his deathbed, Edwin asked Jim to beg Emma to allow Paula and Jim the happiness they were denied. He also asked for Emma's forgiveness, as Jim revealed Edwin had never recovered from the guilt he suffered for abandoning her and their child. Emma was happy to forgive Edwin and give her blessing to Jim and Paula's marriage. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations In 1984, the book was adapted as an eponymous television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as the young Emma Harte; Deborah Kerr plays the older Emma Harte. The debut UK screening of this series, in January 1985, gave Channel 4 its highest ever audience figures, with 13.8 million viewers. The sequels Hold the Dream and To Be the Best were made in 1986 and 1992, respectively. Hold The Dream again features Deborah Kerr as Emma Harte but now stars Jenny Seagrove as her granddaughter, Paula (replacing Miranda Richardson, who had played her in the first mini-series). To Be The Best stars Lindsay Wagner as Paula, running the Harte empire ten years after Emma's death. All three programmes are available on DVD.

Gifford, Dennis, \\"Obituary: Michael Cummings\\", The Independent. 11 October 1997. Retrieved 28 February 2020. Allen, Robert, and Frost, John, Voice of Britain : the inside story of the Daily Express.Cambridge : Stephens, 1983. (p. 160-161) He was known as Michael Cummings and signed his work simply Cummings. Early life Cummings's mother was an artist, while his father, A. J. Cummings, was political editor of the Liberal News Chronicle daily newspaper of London. He was educated at The Hall, Hampstead, London, Gresham's School, in Norfolk, then at the Chelsea School of Art, London. He also liked reading. During the Second World War he worked for the Air Ministry and became a major contributor to the training journal Aircraft Recognition. Work Cummings was initially a supporter of the Labour Party, and contributed illustrations for the pro- Labour magazine Tribune. Cummings later joined the Daily Express; he would subsequently draw most of his work for that newspaper and The Sunday Express. His move to this publications also coincided with Cummings moving to the political right. In a discussion of Cummings' political views, Robert Allen and John Frost described him as a Conservative. They added that Cummings \\"obviously reveres Mrs Thatcher, intensely dislikes Tony Benn (and takes credit for being the first cartoonist to note his wild stare), has no time at all for Ted Heath, and so on\\". Cummings saw himself as \\"a rude little boy speaking out at the awkward moment\\", but to many of his critics he was a reactionary. Common targets of Cumming's pen were the Labour Party, left- leaning town councils, trade unions, student activists, and immigration. Cummings was also opposed to communism, and his cartoons frequently satirized both the Soviet Union and Maoist China.\\"Life and Letters Today\\", Encounter magazine, May 1972, (p. 97) Controversy In 1965, Cummings drew a cartoon depicting Lyndon B. Johnson being entangled in a thorn tree with the head of a black man, while a British politician wearing blinkers watered a plant with the head of a black child. The tree carried three labels on its branches marked \\"Little Rock\\", \\"Malcolm X\\" and \\"Harlem Riots\\". The cartoon was an expression of Cummings' opposition to allowing black people to immigrate to Britain, believing such immigration would cause US-style race riots.‚ÄúNewspaper Picture Brings Censure,‚Äù London Times, May 26, 1965, 8, col. 6. Tuck, Stephen, The night Malcolm X spoke at the Oxford Union : A Transatlantic Story of Antiracist Protest. Oakland, California : University of California Press, 2014, (p.106) This cartoon drew complains from a group of Oxford students. The students made an unsuccessful complaint to the British Press Council, stating that the cartoon distorted \\"historical, political and social realities to express a view which is not merely the lowest taste, but is a direct and calculated insult to coloured peoples both in Britain and America\\". During the conflict in Northern Ireland, Cummings repeatedly caricatured Irish people as diminutive, stupid, and murderous.Hurley, Michael J., Blood on the shamrock : an American ponders Northern Ireland, 1968-1990. New York : Peter Lang, 1991 (p. 264). In October 1971, Cummings drew a cartoon titled \\"Father O'Brezhnev, Missionary to Ulster\\" which depicted Leonid Brezhnev as a Roman Catholic Priest who was supplying weapons to the IRA. On 17 October 1971, National Union of Journalists members on the Scottish Daily Express objected strongly to Cummings' cartoon. The NUJ members described it as anti-Catholic, and expressed fears it would worsen sectarianism in Glasgow.Gallaghter, Tom Glasgow's Uneasy Peace : Religious Tension in Modern Scotland, 1819-1914. Manchester : Manchester University Press, 1987. (p. 295) The NUJ members stopped the presses in protest and over 350,000 copies of the Daily Express were lost. The International Press Institute later criticized the NUJ's action, stating that their refusal to print the Cummings cartoon was \\"a serious threat to freedom of expression, all the more deplorable because the threat comes from journalists.\\" On the 29th May 1982, The Irish Times published an interview with Cummings, during which the reporter took issue with his depiction of the Irish. Cummings responded that he had a \\"cartoonist's licence\\" to depict the Irish as \\"extremely violent, bloody- minded, always fighting, drinking enormous amounts, getting roaring drunk\\". Cummings also added that the IRA's violent acts did tend to \\"make them look rather like apes, though that's rather hard luck on the apes\\". Douglas, Roy, Harte, Liam, O'Hara, Jim, Drawing conclusions : a cartoon history of Anglo- Irish relations, 1798-1998 Belfast : Blackstaff, 1998. (p. 279) This caused several writers to accuse Cummings of promoting anti-Irish prejudices.\\"Cummings, in the Daily and Sunday Express and Jak, of the Evening Standard, in particular, specialized in drawing cartoons of midget Irishmen snarling, fighting, generally behaving in a ridiculous fashion.\\" Kirkadly, John, \\"English Cartoonists, Ulster Realities\\", in Yonah Alexander and Alan O'Day (eds.) Ireland's terrorist dilemma. Dordrecht ; Boston ; Lancaster : M. Nijhoff, 1986. (p.115) Reception Cummings' work was praised by Gerald Nabarro. In his autobiography, NAB 1: Portrait of a Politician, Nabarro described Cummings as a \\"great artist\\" who \\"adds vivacity and insight to every political situation he depicts.\\"Mumford, Alan, Tory Blues : a cartoon history of the Conservative Party London, England : Political Cartoon Society, 2008.

It was first done by the Finnish geodesist V√§is√§l√§ in 1959, who made astrometric photographs of the sky at two stations together with a balloon probe between them. Even this first step showed the potential of the method, because V√§is√§l√§ got the azimuth between Helsinki and Turku (a distance of 150 km) with an accuracy of 1‚Ä≥. Soon the method was successfully tested by ballistic rockets and for some special satellites. Adequate computer programs were written for * the astrometric reduction of the photographic plates, * the intersection of the \\"observation planes\\" containing the stations and the targets, * and the adjustment of stellar-terrestric networks with redundancy. The advantage of stellar triangulation is the possibility to cross far distances (terrestrial observations are restricted to approx. 30 km, and even in high mountains to 60 km), and the independency of the Earth's gravity field. The results are azimuths between the stations in the stellar-inertial navigation system, despite of no direct line of sight. In 1960 the first appropriate space probe was launched: Project Echo, a 30 m diameter balloon satellite. By then the whole of Western Europe could be linked together geodetically with accuracies 2‚Äì10 times better than by classical triangulation. During the late 1960s a global project was begun by H.H. Schmid (Switzerland) to connect 45 stations all over the continents, with distances of 3000‚Äì5000 km. It was finished in 1974 by precise reduction of some 3000 stellar plates and network adjustment of 46 stations (2 additional ones in Germany and the Pacific, but without the areas of Russia and China). The mean accuracy was between ¬±5 m (Europe, USA) and 7‚Äì10 m (Africa, Antarctica), depending of weather and infrastructure conditions. Combined with Doppler measurements the global accuracy was even 3 m. This is more than 20 times better than previously, because the gravity field up to 1974 couldn't be calculated better than 100 meters between distant continents. The use of stars as a reference system was expanded in the 70s and early 80s for continental networks, but then the laser and electronic measurements became better than 2 m and could be carried out automatically. Nowadays some similar techniques are carried out by interferometry with very distant radio quasars instead of optical satellite & star observations. The geodetic connection of radio telescopes is now possible up to mm‚Äìcm precision as published periodically by the IVS community. This global project group was founded in 2000 by Harald Schuh (Munich/TU Vienna) and some dozen research projects worldwide, and is now a permanent service of IUGG and IERS. The photographic observations as done 1959‚Äì1985 are irrelevant now because of their expense, but lead to some renaissance by electro-optical techniques like CCD.

Sullivan was born in Narrandera, New South Wales and educated at Narranderra High School, St Patrick's College, Goulburn, Royal Military College, Duntroon. He married Mollie O'Sullivan in July 1955 and they had two daughters and two sons. Sullivan was a representative for the Division of Riverina in New South Wales in the Australian House of Representatives from the 1974 federal election to 1977. He was a member of the National Party of Australia, which was named the Country Party when he joined Parliament and was renamed the National Country Party in the 1975 elections. He narrowly defeated Labor Immigration Minister Al Grassby in the 1974 election, winning by 864 votes, thanks to the help of anti-immigration groups, led by the Immigration Control Association, which targeted Al Grassby because of his stance on immigration during his time as Minister for Immigration. He was comfortably reelected in the massive Coalition landslide of 1975. Ahead of the 1977 federal election, a redistribution dramatically altered Riverina. The neighbouring seat of Darling, one of the few safe country seats for Labor, was abolished, and the bulk of its territory, including the Labor stronghold of Broken Hill, was merged into Riverina. Sullivan previously held Riverina with a comfortably safe majority of 11 percent, but the redistribution erased his majority and gave Labor a notional majority of two percent. Even though the Coalition was easily re-elected, Sullivan lost his seat to the former member for Darling, Labor's John FitzPatrick. He was the Country Party member for Sturt in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from February to August 1981, winning the 1981 by-election caused by Tim Fischer's resignation to contest the 1980 by- election for the seat of Murray.

Many of his early compositions were co- written by David Martin and/or Chris Arnold, with whom he also recorded, both as 'Arnold, Martin and Morrow' and under the group name of 'Butterscotch'. Fellow songwriter and producer Phil Wainman played the drums for Butterscotch. Morrow and Arnold's first big songwriting success was \\"In Thoughts of You\\", taken to the top ten in the UK Singles Chart by Billy Fury in 1965. All three songwriters composed \\"Annabella\\", originally recorded in the UK by Dave Dee without chart success, but which reached the US charts via a cover version by Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds in 1971. The writers themselves (as Butterscotch) scored another top twenty UK hit in 1970 with \\"Don't You Know (She Said Hello)\\". Arnold, Martin and Morrow went on to compose \\"Can't Smile Without You\\", made famous by Barry Manilow. Morrow also co-wrote four songs for Elvis Presley, with whom he spent time, and Presley made the song \\"Let's Be Friends\\" the title track of an album. Morrow formed two record companies. One record company was sold to RCA and the other to EMI. In 1990, he bought the Manchester Opera House and Palace Theatre, Manchester. He was a director and major shareholder of Caesars Palace, Luton. He wrote five musicals, which have been produced. His latest, A Legendary Romance, produced by Laurence Myers, successfully \\"tried out\\" in New Hampshire. He has also written several screenplays including Don't Go Breaking My Heart. Morrow collaborated with David Simmons to stage two plays.

The UPD rating scale is the most commonly used scale in the clinical study of Parkinson's disease. The UPDRS is made up of these sections:Comprehensive pharmacy review, Leon Shargel, 6th edition, p. 998. *Part I: evaluation of mentation, behavior, and mood *Part II: self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADLs) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food *Part III: clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation *Part IV: complications of therapy *Part V: Hoehn and Yahr staging of severity of Parkinson's disease *Part VI: Schwab and England ADL scale These are evaluated by interview and clinical observation. Some sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity. Clinicians and researchers alike use the UPDRS and the motor section in particular to follow the progression of a person's Parkinson's disease. Scientific researchers use it to measure benefits from a given therapy in a more unified and accepted rating system. Neurologists also use it in clinical practice to follow the progression of their patients' symptoms in a more objective manner. Following the UPDRS scores over time provides insight into the patient's disease progression. For instance Michael J. Fox's symptoms started with a slight tremor, so his motor score would have been less than 10. For most patients, the \\"mentation, behavior and mood\\" scores increase later in the disease, but a subset exists for whom those symptoms develop early on. Similar rating scales Other rating scales for Parkinson's disease are the Hoehn and Yahr scale and Schwab and England activities of daily living scale, although both of these measures are currently included within the UPDRS in modified format. MDS-UPDRS In 2007, the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) published a revision of the UPDRS, known as the MDS-UPDRS. The revision became desirable after an MDS-sponsored Task Force on Rating Scales for Parkinson's Disease highlighted the limitations of the original UPDRS. Two major limitations include the lack of consistent anchor among subscales and the low emphasis on the nonmotor features of PD. The modified UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The scales are now titled; (1) nonmotor experiences of daily living (13 items), (2) motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (3) motor examination (18 items), and (4) motor complications (six items). Each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.

He was Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford from 1944 to 1968.  Life  Cross was born in Honiton on 22 January 1900 to the pharmacist Herbert Francis Cross and his wife Louisa Georgina. The family moved to Bournemouth whilst he was a child, where he won the Domus scholarship for natural science at Balliol College, Oxford, taking honours in chemistry and crystallography and then, in 1922, following tuition at Keble College, Oxford, first-class honours in theology. He studied in Marburg and Freiburg im Breisgau, taking a Doctor of Philosophy degree at Oxford in 1930The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (First Edition, 1957) with a dissertation on Edmund Husserl.

In 1927 he became one of the priest-librarians of Pusey House, Oxford, of which he became Custodian in 1934. He was appointed Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity and Canon of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1944, by which time his interest in patristics was developing, alongside the beginnings of The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, which was published in 1957. At the time of his death he was working on the second edition. Post-war he organised international conferences, initially to re-establish relations with Christians in Germany. He organized the First International Conference on Patristic Studies in 1951, the second in 1955 and served as editor of the first 11 volumes of Studia Patristica, the official publication of the conference. Additionally, he also organized New Testament congresses. As well as their academic importance, the conferences were an early expression of ecumenism.

Finished in 1974, the network connected 46 stations (3000-5000 km distance) of all continents with an accuracy of 3-5 m (approx. 20 times better than terrestrial triangulations at that time). Orbit The PAGEOS spacecraft was placed into a polar orbit (inclination 85‚Äì86¬∞) with a height of approx. 4000 km, which had gradually lowered during its 9 years of operation. The satellite partly disintegrated in July 1975, which was followed by a second break-up that occurred in January 1976 resulting in the release of a large number of fragments. Most of these re-entered during the following decade. PAGEOS data has been tracked 11 times. PAGEOS' predecessors in satellite triangulation were the balloons Echo 1 (1960, 30 m) and Echo 2 (1964, 40 m) which were also used for passive telecommunication. Their apparent magnitude (brightness) was 1 mag, that of Pageos 2 mag (like Polaris) due to its higher orbit. Pageos could therefore be observed simultaneously e.g. from the ground in places such as Europe and North America. PAGEOS appeared as a slow-moving star (at first glance it would appear to be stationary). Its orbital period was approximately three hours. Because of its high orbit and polar inclination it would avoid the Earth's shadow and be observed any time of the night (low-orbit satellites are only observable shortly after sunset and before sunrise). In the early 1970s PAGEOS varied from 2nd apparent magnitude to beyond visibility over a period of a few minutes. In 2016, one of the largest fragments of PAGEOS de-orbited.

The winner of the Vaahteraliiga is the Finnish champion. The Vaahteraliiga season is played in summer, with a schedule usually from May to September.  History  The first season of the Vaahteraliiga was played in 1980. The name Vaahteraliiga (\\"Maple League\\") comes from the name of the championship trophy Vaahteramalja (\\"Maple Bowl\\"), which was donated to the newly formed association by the embassy of Canada in Finland. Vaahteraliiga is managed by American Football Association of Finland ‚Äì SAJL. It is government approved non-profit organization governing both American football and flag football activities in Finland. The most successful team all-time are the Helsinki Roosters with a total of 17 championships, including a then-record six consecutive first-place finishes from 1995-2000. This record was tied by Porvoo Butchers as they also won six consecutive championships between 2005 and 2010. In the early years Helsinki and it surrounding towns were loaded with Maple League teams and they seemed to almost monopolize the championship. The first team outside the Helsinki metropolitan area to win the championship were the Sein√§joki Crocodiles in 2001, ending the 21-year Helsinki area supremacy. Since then, however, those teams have only won the championship twice. Turku Trojans have the most Maple Bowl losses. Having qualified for the game ten times, their only win is from their last visit in 2003. The 2016 season of Vaahteraliiga was planned to see 8 teams competing, as Tampere Saints and Wasa Royals were promoted from 1st Division. Helsinki 69ers did not start the season, so the 2016 season had 7 teams. The 2017 season also has 7 teams, as TAFT was relegated after finishing last, and I-division winner H√§meenlinna Huskies were promoted to Maple League. Current teams * Butchers, Porvoo * Crocodiles, Sein√§joki * Roosters, Helsinki (Current champions) * Royals, Vaasa * Steelers, Kuopio * Wolverines, Helsinki Updated for upcoming 2020 season. League license Vaahteraliiga has had a different number of teams during its tenure. In recent years the number has been around seven and eight. This is partly because of league license system enforced by SAJL. In addition to competitive status teams have to reach certain economical and organisational standards. This in turn means that at the end of each season it cannot be said to a certainty which teams will eventually play in the league the next year as teams need to apply for the license. SAJL checks the applications and grants licenses to maximum eight teams according to their seed in the previous season. Teams from the 1st division title game, Spaghetti Bowl, are the only division teams eligible to apply for the license. The system was put in place largely to ensure long-term planning and sensible running of clubs. The system has already shown its cruelty as teams with no alarming difficulties in competitiveness have been relegated due to lack of management and/or economical difficulties. Playing format Regular season League schedule is highly dependent on the number of teams. During seasons of eight teams teams are divided into two pools. Teams play against the teams in the same pool twice, home and away, and teams from the other pool once so that each team has ten games, five home and five away. Despite the pools teams are considered as one conference and they are seeded in one conference. In a seven-team league teams face each team twice, home and away, with a total of 12 games. Post season After the regular season the four best teams advance to the post season with seed #1 facing #4 and #2 facing #3 in a single-game play-off. Winners will play in the Maple Bowl for the national title. As of 2006, there hasn't been a game for the bronze medal; they are simply awarded to the losing team of the semi- finals with better seed.

The Bell JetRanger in the background provided a microwave link between tracking stations positioned around the racetrack and the race car RaceCam installed in a Daytona Prototype RaceCam is a video camera system used primarily in motor racing, which uses a network of car-mounted cameras, microwave radio transmitters, and relays from helicopters to send live images from inside a race car to both pit crews and television audiences. Although a vehicle- mounted 16mm motion picture camera was used once in 1973, the technology was first developed in the late 1970s by the Seven Network in Australia, who introduced it for the 1979 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 endurance race at Mount Panorama in Bathurst, New South Wales with Sydney-based driver Peter Williamson able to give commentary from his Toyota Celica. RaceCam in Australia was unique in that the drivers were often wired for sound and able to converse with the television commentary team during races with top touring car drivers such as Dick Johnson, Allan Grice, Peter Brock and later Glenn Seton, Jim Richards, Mark Skaife, Wayne Gardner and Channel Seven's own commentator turned racer Neil Crompton all becoming regular users of the system. RaceCam (with drivers doing their own commentary) became a staple of Seven's Australian Touring Car Championship and Bathurst 1000 broadcasts during the 1980s and 1990s.Peter Brock describes a lap of Bathurst 1986 ESPN helicopter at NASCAR Nationwide event American audiences were first introduced to RaceCam at NASCAR's 1979 Daytona 500 on CBS network with Benny Parsons' Chevrolet Monte Carlo, and later at the 1983 Indianapolis 500, when ABC acquired the rights to use a streamlined version of the technology for their coverage of the race. The first Indy winning car with a RaceCam was that of Rick Mears in 1991. Over the years, the camera location varied from \\"over-the-shoulder\\" in 1983, to rear- mounted (looking backwards) in 1988, nosecone-mounted in 1994, and rollbar/above-mounted in 1997. Later, the above-mounted cameras were improved to be able to rotate 360¬∞. Other camera views have included the rear wing (just above the rear tyre), the gearbox, the driver's helmet (\\"Visor cam\\"), a \\"footcam\\" looking at the driver's feet (to illustrate the heel-and-toe shifting process in road racing), and a view from the sidepod. Additional mounting locations inside the cockpit gave a face view of the driver, but usually little or no view of the track. The \\"CrewCam\\" was another view, mounted on a pit crew member's hat or helmet, showing the point of view of a pit crew member performing his duties on pit road. In the same time-frame, CBS and ESPN began using on-board cameras during NASCAR telecasts from different developers. The large, boxy interior of the NASCAR stock cars allowed modified, nearly regular-sized video cameras to be mounted in the cockpit. CBS used a remote controlled, 360¬∞ rotating camera, and 1984 Daytona 500 winner Cale Yarborough carried one to victory. While Racecam units had become common place in NASCAR, unlike in Australian touring car racing the drivers generally refused to be wired to talk to the television commentators while driving, saying that it was too distracting. In a NASCAR first, at the 1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500 held at the Calder Park Thunderdome in Melbourne, Australia (which was also the first NASCAR race held outside of North America), Australian drivers Dick Johnson and Allan Grice talked to the Channel 7 commentators during the race. Johnson, who had been using Racecam since 1982, also created a first for American NASCAR viewers when he was able to talk to the ESPN commentators during the 1989 Banquet Frozen Foods 300 at Sears Point Raceway. When Johnson's car went off on oil during the race, he was famously caught dropping the F-bomb just before riding up a bank.1989 Banquet 300 - Dick Johnson Crash Typically in NASCAR, any conversations with drivers are done before the race, after the race, or during safety car periods as not to interfere with normal driver to crew communications. Over the years, RaceCam has been refined and led to further developments. Besides the natural upgrades for high definition television, the \\"Bumpercam\\" uses a camera mounted on the car's bumper. The \\"Roofcam\\" is a camera mounted on a car's roof, which gives a broader view, and a more authentic perspective of the driver's sightlines. Both systems are popular with NASCAR viewers. \\"Clearview\\" is another system, which removes grit and dust from the lens. Formula One has also incorporates similar technology, with each car featuring a distinctive streamlined \\"camera pod\\" mounted above each car's airbox, giving video from a perspective similar to the driver's point of view, while also allowing a rearward-facing view for cars trailing behind. FIA regulations mandate that a total of five cameras (or dummy camera housings) must be mounted on the car, in a choice of several predetermined positions. In IndyCar, all cars in the field are equipped with multiple \\"camera pod\\" housing units - one each above the roll bar, one embedded within the front nosecone, one in the aeroscreen, and in previous season, one the rear wing, and inside one of the rear-view mirrors - regardless if they are actually carrying cameras in those locations. This rule is such that cars carrying cameras will not have an aerodynamic disadvantage (or advantage) compared to cars not carrying cameras. In addition, camera-less cars carry equivalent ballast in place of the cameras, to ensure all cars have equal weight characteristics.

In 1635, Nicholas fought against Swedish infantry and French cavalry at Rambervillers, not far from his home village. He was taken prisoner by German troops on the march and was treated like a spy. They even threatened to hang him. He fearlessly answered that he was not what they suspected. When the soldiers saw his courage they released him. The Swedes entered Lorraine , and while passing through the area attacked the little town of Rambervillers where he became wounded leaving him permanently lame (Rambervillers had 2660 inhabitants at the time; eight years later there were only 400 survivors). The ghastly experience of battle seared his mind to such a degree that he fell back on his religious upbringing, and never looked back. He never spoke of the horrors he had experienced, but the effects remained with him for the rest of his life. After a period of convalescence in his parents' home, he entered the employment of William de Fuibert, treasurer to the king of France. Serving as a footman, Lawrence describes himself as \\"a great awkward fellow who broke everything\\". Thus when his service as a footman ended, Nicholas sought spiritual fulfillment in the solitude of a hermit's life. He firmly resolved to follow in the footsteps of his uncle, a holy Discalced Carmelite. In mid- June, at the age of twenty-six, he entered the Order of Discalced Carmelites on the Rue Vaugirard in Paris,https://www.dlsfootsteps.org/cities/paris/carmelite-abbey/ as a lay brother. In June 1640, Nicolas joined the Discalced Carmelite Priory in Paris.Ibid., p. xix. He entered the priory as a lay brother and took the religious name, \\"Lawrence of the Resurrection\\". He made his solemn profession of vows on August 14, 1642.Ibid., p. xx. He spent the rest of his life with the Parisian community, where his primary assignments were working in the kitchen and, in his later years, repairing sandals. Ibid. He entered fearing 'they would skin him alive' for his awkwardness and faults‚Äîas he said in his own unpolished language, often seasoned with humor-but fortunately for himself and his brothers 'he experienced only satisfaction'. He carried out this office of cook‚Ä¶ until providence ordained otherwise. His leg became ulcerated, so his superiors had to assign him to an easier task‚Ä¶as sandal maker, after suffering from 'a kind of sciatic gout that worsened as the years went by. Gradually, the influence of the humble sandal-maker grew, not only among the poor. Many learned people, religious and ecclesiastics had esteem for him as well‚Ä¶Fenelon among them. Despite his lowly position in life and the priory, his character attracted many to him. He had a reputation for experiencing profound peace and visitors came to seek spiritual guidance from him.Ibid., pp. xx-xxi. The wisdom he passed on to them, in conversations and in letters, would later become the basis for the book, The Practice of the Presence of God. The conversations had been conducted and recorded by a notable cleric, the Abb√© Joseph de Beaufort, who compiled this work after Brother Lawrence died.J.D. Nelson, Practice of the Presence of God with Devotional and Study Guide, p. 15. This little book was approved by Archbishop of Paris, Louis Antoine de Noailles. When the Archbishop of Paris approved the life of Brother Lawrence made by his Grand Vicar and in his own organisation, he approved that it is said that this brother \\"forgot himself and was willing to lose himself for God, That he no longer thought of virtue or his salvation ... that he had always governed himself by love without interest.≈íUVRES CHOISIES DE F√âNELON (SELECTED WORKS of FENELON), Volume II, p. 320-321, 335, https://archive.org/details/oeuvresdefenelon02fn/page/4 The book consists of sixteen short Letters by himself, a short collection of Spiritual Maxims embodying his views, four Conversations, probably written down by M.

She was resold in 1989 to Western Sea Inc., of Seattle, Washington, for service as a fish factory ship and renamed Western Sea. Her final fate is unknown, although it seems unlikely that she is still in service.

He was the first African-American conductor of a major orchestra. Life and career Simmons was born in San Francisco, California, in 1950. At the age of 9, he entered the Bay Area's musical scene and began living his dream of becoming a world-class musician. He had been taught the piano from an early age by his mother, Matty. By age 11, he was conducting the San Francisco Boys Chorus, started by Madi Bacon, of which he had been a member. Bacon gave him the early artistic freedom to assist with the chorus that would serve him and others for years. He was assistant conductor with the San Francisco Opera from 1972 to 1975, winning the Kurt Herbert Adler Award.Obituary - Calvin Simmons, American conductor. Opera, December 1982, Vol.33 No.12, p1244. After working as assistant conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, Simmons became musical director of the Oakland Symphony Orchestra at age 28; he led the orchestra for four years. He continued to conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic, both at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and at the Hollywood Bowl. He would support Carmen McRae singing jazz one night, then conduct William Walton or Holst's The Planets a night or two later. He was the first African-American to be named conductor of a major U.S. symphony orchestra, and was a frequent guest conductor with some of the nation's major opera companies and orchestras (such as the Philadelphia Orchestra). He was the Music Director at the Ojai Music Festival in 1978. He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera on 20 December 1978, aged 28, conducting Engelbert Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel. He returned the following season for the same opera, of which he conducted a total of 18 performances. He was on the musical staff at Glyndebourne from 1974 to 1978, and conducted the Glyndebourne Touring Opera, including Cos√¨ fan tutte in 1975.Milnes, Rodney. Glyndebourne Touring Opera at the New Theatre, Oxford. Opera, December 1975, Vol.26 No.12, p1180. He collaborated with the British director Jonathan Miller on a celebrated production of Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte at the Opera Theater of St. Louis (USA) shortly before his death. He remained active at the San Francisco Opera for all his adult life, supporting General Director Kurt Herbert Adler, first as a repetiteur and then as a member of the conducting staff. He made his formal debut conducting Giacomo Puccini's La Boh√®me with Ileana Cotrubas. His later work on a production of Dmitri Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District drew national attention. In 1979 he conducted the premiere of Menotti's La Loca at San Diego. His final concerts were three performances of the Requiem of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the summer of 1982 with the Masterworks Chorale and the Midsummer Mozart Festival Orchestra. Other work The short story \\"Addio San Francisco\\", which appears in the anthology Murder at the Opera (Mysterious Press, 1989), was written by Simmons with editor Thomas Godfrey, under a pseudonym. Death Simmons died in a canoeing accident at age 32 near Lake Placid in New York. After a large public funeral at San Francisco's Grace Cathedral, he was buried in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. At a memorial concert held in Oakland's Paramount Theater a few weeks later, he was remembered for his talent, his quick wit and sense of fun, and his ability to get on top of any score quickly. Legacy The Oakland Symphony Orchestra was reorganized in July 1988 as the Oakland East Bay Symphony Orchestra. Simmons was honored by the naming of the Calvin Simmons Theatre at the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center in Oakland, California. The Calvin Simmons Middle School in Oakland was named for him, but has since changed its name to United For Success Academy. Simmons is also the namesake of the grand ballroom of the Oakland Marriott Hotel. His death inspired Lou Harrison to compose Elegy, To The Memory Of Calvin Simmons; Michael Tippett to compose The Blue Guitar, a sonata for solo guitar; and Robert Hughes to compose Sop'o muerte se cande, for high tenor and orchestra (1983, 2013). John Harbison wrote Exequien for Calvin Simmons. Simmons conducted Harbison's Violin Concerto shortly before his death.

It was issued under the internal market provisions of the Treaty of Rome. The most recent version is Directive 2009/24/EC.  History  In Europe, the need to foster the computer software industry brought attention to the lack of adequate harmonisation among the copyright laws of the various EU nations with respect to such software. Preamble to Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 Economic pressure spurred the development of the first directive which had two goals (1) the harmonisation of the law and (2) dealing with the problems caused by the need for interoperability. The first EU Directive on the legal protection of computer programs was Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991. It required (Art. 1) that computer programs and any associated design material be protected under copyright as literary works within the sense of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works The Directive also defined the copyright protection to be applied to computer programs: the owner of the copyright has the exclusive right to authorise (Art 4): * the temporary or permanent copying of the program, including any copying which may be necessary to load, view or run the program; * the translation, adaptation or other alteration to the program; * the distribution of the program to the public by any means, including rental, subject to the first- sale doctrine. However, these rights are subject to certain limitations (Art. 5). The legal owner of a program is assumed to have a licence to create any copies necessary to use the program and to alter the program within its intended purpose (e.g. for error correction). The legal owner may also make a back-up copy for his or her personal use. The program may also be decompiled if this is necessary to ensure it operates with another program or device (Art. 6), but the results of the decompilation may not be used for any other purpose without infringing the copyright in the program. The duration of the copyright was originally fixed at the life of the author plus fifty years (Art. 8), in accordance with the Berne Convention standard for literary works (Art. 7.1 Berne Convention). This has since been prolonged to the life of the author plus seventy years by the 1993 Copyright Duration Directive (superseded but confirmed by the 2006 Copyright Term Directive).Council Directive 93/98/EEC of 29 October 1993 harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights, OJ no.

It also worked with the Imperial Japanese Navy Shipping Services. The section was commanded by Okikatsu Arao, S≈çsaku Suzuki and other Army officers. The section comprised the First (Operations) and Third (Transportation and Communications) bureaux, the 2nd (Operations) and 10th (Shipping and Railways) sections. To conduct operations on rivers and at sea the Japanese Army produced many kinds of vessel, i.e. landing craft, motorboats, gun boats, landing ships etc. In the Pacific War, they built aircraft carriers and submarines. Besides the Army engineer units for river-crossing, the Japanese Army had their own shipping force to transport troops at sea which sometimes acted in concert with Japanese Navy vessels to transport their forces. It was a large force which employed 300,000 soldiers (Army Shipping Units) at maximum and managed 30% of Japanese transport ships. For the Japanese Army, the Pacific War was not only a battle on the ground, but also at sea. Many Japanese soldiers fought on board against enemy submarines, PT boats and airplanes. At last, they rode on a Kamikaze special-attack boat and dashed into the enemy ship. Air transport Air transport was charged to Hik≈çtai Transport Unit of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, sometimes both services were coordinated with amphibious transport services and other special wartime operations. In Manchukuo the Army was linked to transport services with local transport units of Kwantung Army Railway and Air Transport units and Manchukuoan Air and land Transport services which served in Kwantung, Northern China, Manchukuo and Chosen. On land the Army also used the services of Kwantung Army Field Railway Command (in Manchukuo), the 1st and 2nd Field Railway Commands, China Expeditionary Army (Chinese occupied lands) and Southeast Asia Field Railway Command of Southern Army in its controlled lands along with land transports services in its Army units in combat front joining rail services previously mentioned. Actually, shipping and aircraft were parts of a vicious circle. In order to realize increased production of aircraft, raw materials had to be conveyed by ship from overseas. Since vessels were lost in the process, a shortage of materials resulted. This affected the output of planes. But if aircraft were not turned out in increased numbers, surface shipping could not be covered from the air. Thus, the more ships were sunk, the less airplanes could be manufactured. Herein lay the cause for increasingly bitter antagonism between the Army and the Navy. Shipping operations The loss of ships increased sharply as the war went on. In round figures, the total tonnage of Army, Navy, and commercial shipping sunk mounted from year to year; that is, from about 880,000 tons in 1942 to 1,600,000 tons by the next year. The approximate net difference between new construction and losses amounted to minus 460,000 tons in 1942, and to minus 490,000 tons in 1943. (Prior to the start of the War, shipping losses had been expected to total some 800,000 tons during the first year of hostilities, and only 600,000 tons during the second.) In 1944 shipping losses soared: 290,000 tons in January; 380,000 tons in February; and 340,000 tons in March. Because of this critical situation, convoy measures became a pressing problem of the Army and the Navy. An agreement had been reached between the two armed services, whereby the Navy was to assume responsibility for convoying ships. But the Navy was preoccupied with combat operations and could not take care of shipping protection. The personnel charged with Army shipping operations felt that the prerequisite for victory in the Pacific War was safeguarding surface transportation. They argued strongly that the Combined Fleet should devote its main strength to convoy work, like the British Navy had done during World War I. In order to gain naval victory, Japan should use both aircraft carriers and island bases (the so-called \\"unsinkable carriers\\") to knock out enemy warships from the air. Efforts should meanwhile be made to reinforce air power by making surface transportation secure-thus accelerating aircraft production, in turn. Although the Navy set up a Shipping Convoy Headquarters toward the end of 1943, the tonnage of losses did not decrease. The Army therefore adopted its own measures for coping with the problem: #Hurriedly build wartime-type vessels #Construct transport submarines and special convoy vessels (a kind of special escort/aircraft carrier) #Produce anti-submarine radar weapons #Arm merchantmen with anti-submarine guns By 1944, measures to counter the mounting losses of ships had become imperative, and both of the armed services were conducting joint investigations. On March 17, 1944, a Joint Army-Navy Conference was held in the presence of the Emperor, to study methods of meeting the shipping-loss problem. The Army sent its Chief of Staff, the two Deputy Chiefs, the heads of the First (Operations) and Third (Transportation and Communications) bureaus, the heads of the 2nd (Operations) and 10th (Shipping and Railways) sections, the Vice-Minister of the Army, the Chief of the Bureau of Military Affairs, and the head of the Military Affairs Section. The Navy was represented by its counterparts. There was no precedent for such a session, which indicates the gravity of the shipping menace. The conference took 2 hours, and the Army finally decided to adopt certain major measures: *An increase in Army Shipping Units (ship engineers-soldiers who could handle large motor vessels) *Efficient utilization of shipping, by decreasing the amount of munition loads, accelerating both loading and unloading operations, and assigning cargo foremen. *Anti-submarine protective measures (primarily aircraft) *Reinforcement of the aerial defenses of maritime bases War Minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç had good reasons for adhering to his opinion during the arguments with the Army High Command about the problem of requisitioning operational shipping space. Previously, in June 1938, the Army had established the Tama Army Technical Research Institute, with the objective of speeding up the practical application of radar devices. Ground and aerial investigations which, until then, had been pursued separately, were to be integrated and developed along military lines. In order to devise efficient radar weapons for practical use as soon as possible, however, both the Army and the Navy should have pooled their research facilities; but here again the serious rivalry between the armed services stood in the way. The Army itself studied and manufactured anti-submarine radar equipment to be installed on its own transports. Among those concerned with Army operations, incidentally, not a few were of the opinion that the inferiority of anti-submarine radar devices was a cause for Japan's defeat. In other words, the country lost out in the logistical sense because of great shipping losses, which were in turn directly attributable to the radar weaknesses. Accompanying the decline in maritime transportation potential, the Army began to seek an improvement in the movement capacity of the railroads on the Asiatic Continent-to make up for deficiencies at sea. On February 10, 1944, the Army accordingly reinforced and redeployed its railway forces on a large scale. Four organizations were set up: *Kwantung Army Field Railway Command *1st and 2d Field Railway Commands, China Expeditionary Army (North and Central China, respectively) *Field Railway Command, Southern Army, Southeast Asia List of commanders and units in Railways and Shipping Section General commanders in Railways and Shipping services *Okikatsu Arao: Section Chief (Railways and Shipping), Army General Staff *S≈çsaku Suzuki: Chief, Army Shipping Department and Central Shipping Transportation Headquarters *Yoshio Kozuki: Commanding General, Shipping Transportation Headquarters *Hideo Baba: General Officer Commanding Army Maritime Transport Command Shipping units commanders *Masazumi Inada: Commanding Officer 3rd Shipping Transport Command, Singapore *Shinobu Ito: Commanding Officer 2nd Shipping Transport Command, China *Hakaru Gondo: Commanding Officer 13th Shipping Group *53rd Army Anchorange HQ, Uruppu, Kuriles *6th Disembarkation Unit (800 men), Uruppu, Kuriles *6th Shipping Army Engineers Regiment, Etorofu, Kuriles Railways units commanders *Hataz≈ç Adachi: Commanding Officer Kwantung Army Railway Command *Shizuo Yokoyama: Commander of Railway Sector Headquarters, Kwantung Army *Hitoshi Hamada: Second Superintendent of Railways, Thailand *Katsumi Adachi: General Officer Commanding 4th Special Railway Corps, Thailand Transport units commanders *Utata Fukunaga: Commanding Officer 16th Field Transport Command, Malaya *Kiyoshi Hiraoka: Commanding Officer 11th Field Transport Command, China *Nobuyoshi Obata: Commanding Officer, Transportation Regiment, Imperial Guard Division (serving in Tokyo; French Indo-China; Malaya; Sumatra) *88th Transport Regiment, Karafuto List Japanese Army watercraft used during the Pacific War River-crossing craft *Type 95 Collapsible Boat *Type 99 Pontoon Bridge *Rubber Rafts Motorized landing craft *Personnel landing craft \\"Shohatsu\\" *Vehicle landing craft \\"Daihatsu\\" *Vehicle landing craft \\"Toku-Daihatsu\\" *Vehicle landing craft \\"Mokusei-Daihatsu\\" Liaison motorboats *Speedboat Model Ko *Speedboat Model Otsu Special attack motorboat *Suicide-Attack Motorboat \\"Maru-Re\\" Patrol boats/gun boats *Armored boat \\"AB-Tei\\" *Armored boat \\"ST-Tei\\" *Submarine-chaser \\"Karo-Tei\\" *Escort ships \\"Type 5\\", models Ko and Otsu Landing craft carriers *Landing craft carrier \\"Shinshu Maru\\" *Escort/landing craft carrier Model Ko, Otsu, Hei Transport vessels *Tank landing ship \\"SS-Tei\\" *Fast transport vessel \\"Yi-Go\\" *Transport submarine \\"Maru-Yu\\" See also *Foreign commerce and shipping of Empire of Japan *Merchant-shipping codes: JN-39 (Maru code)/JN-40/JN-152/JN-167 *Imperial Japanese Army shipping artillery Category:Military history of Japan Category:Imperial Japanese Army Category:Military logistics of World War II ","title":"Imperial Japanese Army Railways and Shipping Section"},{"id":"7163087","text":"Council Directive 93/83/EEC of 27 September 1993 on the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission is a European Union directive which governs the application of copyright and related rights to satellite and cable television in the European Union. It was made under the internal market provisions of the Treaty of Rome.  Satellite broadcasting  An author has the exclusive right to authorise or to prohibit the broadcasting of his or her works by satellite (Art. 2). This right may only be subject to a compulsory licensing scheme when the satellite broadcast is simultaneous with a terrestrial broadcast [Art. 3(2)]. Satellite broadcasting is assimilated to terrestrial broadcasting for the purposes of related rights (rights of performers, phonogram producers and broadcasting organisations) (Art. 4): the protection of these rights is governed by Directive 92/100/EEC.  Cable retransmission  The main effect of the Directive is to stipulate that cable retransmission must be on the basis of contractual, not statutory, licences with copyright holders, although existing statutory licence schemes were permitted to remain in force until the end of 1997 (Art. 8). These licences may only be granted or refused by collecting societies [Art. 9(1)], which effectively makes such societies compulsory: a collecting society may be deemed to be mandated to manage the cable retransmission rights of a copyright holder in the absence of any expressive agreement [Art. 9(2)]. Broadcasting organisations are free to exercise their own related rights to licence or prohibit the cable retransmission of their own broadcasts (Art. 10). The Directive also provides for mediation in disputes between cable operators and collecting societies (Art. 11) and for measures to prevent abuse of monopoly powers (Art. 12).

She was the longest serving First Lady in Japanese history. Overviews  Life  Abe with Juliana Awada, First Lady of Argentina, November 2018. Born , Akie is regarded as a socialite. She is from a wealthy Japanese family; her father is the former president of Morinaga & Co., one of Japan's largest confectionery companies. She was educated at Sacred Heart School in Tokyo (or Seishin Joshi Gakuin), a Roman Catholic private elementary through high school, then graduated from Sacred Heart Professional Training College. Abe later worked for Dentsu Inc., the world's largest advertising agency, before marrying Shinzo Abe in 1987. The couple have no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments earlier in their marriage. In the late 1990s, Abe worked as a radio disc jockey in her husband's hometown of Shimonoseki. She was popular in the broadcast area and was known by her jockey name, \\"Akky\\". Following her husband's first stint as prime minister, she opened an organic izakaya in the Kanda district of Tokyo, but was not active in management due to the urging of her mother-in-law. She received a master's degree in Social Design Studies from Rikkyo University in March 2011.  As wife of Prime Minister  Akie with Shinz≈ç Abe, May 19, 2017. Akie became popularly known as the \\"domestic opposition party\\" due to her outspoken views, which often contradicted her husband's. Abe is also known as a supporter of sexual minorities and the LGBT community. On April 27, 2014, she joined the gay pride parade in Tokyo to show her support for broader rights to Japan's LGBT community. In 2015, she was photographed standing in a field of cannabis plants promoting the revival of the cannabis culture in Japan.Johann Hari, Japan, the place with the strangest drug debate in the world, Opendemocracy.net, 11 May 2018 While her husband was in office, Abe developed a close relationship with the Moritomo Gakuen kindergarten in Osaka, which is noted for its conservative and militarist culture, including requiring students to memorize the Imperial Rescript on Education. Abe was named as honorary principal of Mizuho no Kuni, an elementary school under development by Moritomo Gakuen, but resigned in February 2017 after it was discovered that Moritomo Gakuen had purchased the land for the school from the government for 14% of its appraised value. The Moritomo Gakuen scandal highlighted the complicated role of the prime minister's wife in Japan: although Abe herself was not considered a civil servant, she was supported by a staff of five civil servants seconded from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, thus implying that her role carries public duties. Abe was the first spouse of a Japanese prime minister to actively use social media, and was particularly personally active on Facebook and Instagram, but dramatically reduced her social media activities and changed the style of her posts in the wake of the Moritomo Gakuen scandal.

The compilation includes letters, as well as records of his conversations kept by Brother Lawrence's interlocutors. The basic theme of the book is the development of an awareness of the presence of God. About Brother Lawrence The first conversation in the book recounts Brother Lawrence's conversion to a deeper commitment to his Christian faith at 18 years old: \\"...in the winter, seeing a tree stripped of its leaves, and considering that within a little time, the leaves would be renewed, and after that the flowers and fruit appear, he received a high view of the Providence and Power of God, which has never since been effaced from his soul.\\". At the age of 24, Brother Lawrence joined the Order of Discalced Carmelites in Paris, taking the religious name \\"Lawrence of the Resurrection\\". He spent the rest of his life with this order, dying on 12 February 1691. During his time as a friar he was much preoccupied with the cultivating a keen sensitivity to the presence of God in everyday life. Theme The text attempts to explain Lawrence's method of acquiring the presence of God. A summary of his approach can be gleaned from the following passages. \\"That he had always been governed by love, without selfish views; and that having resolved to make the love of GOD the end of all his actions, he had found reasons to be well satisfied with his method. That he was pleased when he could take up a straw from the ground for the love of GOD, seeking Him only, and nothing else, not even His gifts.\\" \\"That in order to form a habit of conversing with GOD continually, and referring all we do to Him; we must at first apply to Him with some diligence: but that after a little care we should find His love inwardly excite us to it without any difficulty.\\" Translations Translators and readers have been struck by Brother Lawrence's seeming simplicity. \\"When I was exposed to his thoughts for the first time,\\" wrote Henri Nouwen, \\"they seemed simple, even somewhat naive and unrealistic.\\" Nouwen added that the more he reflected on Brother Lawrence's advice, he became aware that it \\"is not just a nice idea for a seventeenth-century monk but a most important challenge to our present- day life situation.\\"Nouwen, Henri, J.M., Foreword, The Practice of the Presence of God, trans. John Delaney (Image, 1977): 10. Translator Robert J. Edmonson had a similar experience. \\"I had an image of Brother Lawrence as a jolly monk who took pleasure in cleaning pots and cooking,\\" Edmonson wrote. \\"I was struck by the depth of his love for God and his life lived in obedience, humility, and concern for others.\\"Edmonson, Robert, Translator's Note, Practicing the Presence of God, trans. Robert Edmonson (Paraclete, 2007): vii. This paradox reflects the challenge facing translators, which is best illustrated by comparing the translations of one of the more famous passages. First, from the original 1692 French edition of Maximes spirituelles: > L'on seroit m√™me surpris si l'on s√ßavoit ce que l'ame dit quelquefois √† > Dieu.Maximes spirituelles fort utiles aux √¢mes pieuses, pour acqu√©rir la > pr√©sence de Dieu (Edme Couterot, 1692): 97. Robert Edmonson took a straightforward approach in his translation of this Maximes passage: > We would be quite surprised if we knew what the soul sometimes says to > God.Practicing the Presence of God, trans. Robert Edmonson (Paraclete, > 2007): 115. Translators John Delaney, Edward Musgrave Blaiklock and Salvatore Sciurba rendered the passage with the same semi-literal interpretation.See The Practice of the Presence of God, trans. John Delaney (Image, 1977): 108; and The Practice of the Presence of God, trans. E.M. Blaiklock (Hodder & Stoughton, 1981): 74; The Practice of the Presence of God, critical edition, trans. Salvatore Sciurba (ICS, 2015): 43. Brother Lawrence could be surprisingly subtle: the original French has an implied sense of conversation, perhaps even of communion, that is difficult to communicate without taking a few liberties, as in the Donald Attwater translation of the same Maximes passage: > We should be surprised if we knew what converse the soul sometimes holds > with God.The Practice of the Presence of God, trans. Donald Attwater > (Templegate, 1974): 121. Attwater's was a common approach taken by many translators of this passage: \\"Conversation with God occurs in the depth and center of the soul,\\" in one translationOften attributed to Sister Mary David, The Practice of the Presence of God (Whitaker House, 1982): 68.; and in another, \\"Great would be our surprise, if we but knew what converse the soul holds at times with God.\\"Copyrighted by but not attributed to Fleming H. Revell, The Practice of the Presence of God with Spiritual Maxims (Spire, 1967): 78.

The school is on London Road in the Portsmouth northern sub district of Hilsea. The current comprehensive school, established in 1975, was the product of an amalgamation of four separate secondary schools in the west of the City of Portsmouth. Formerly a boys' school, the school became coeducational in September 2015. History The school has existed in various forms since 1905. The original main campus building consisted of a red brick three-floor complex surrounding an inner grass quadrangle or 'quad'. This square complex forms the oldest part of the school today, facing London road. It is currently used for the administration, history and computer departments, as well as the library. In 1944 the school became a technical college, second in the tier of the three school system (above secondary modern status and below Grammar). It was named the Portsmouth Technical High School and retained this title until 1975. Under the tripartite system of the Butler Education Act, the school was expanded beyond the original main square complex. In 1974 the school switched to the comprehensive system and the school was rebuilt in its present form that exists today.Hampshire County Council Until 1984 the school had occupied premises on two sites, the Main Campus off London Road, Hilsea (previously the Technical High School) and the Lower School in Doyle Avenue (previously Hilsea Modern School). The new building, consisting of mainly pre-fabricated materials and glass, more than doubled the size of the school. The original 'quad' building was incorporated into a new glass and concrete complex, that included a five-floor tower containing the English and Science departments. Other new buildings included new dining facilities, a new modern sports complex with two Gyms and a new main hall and auditorium (which contains the school's trophies and plaques dating to the school's formation). The technology department was established a few years later and extended away from the school. At this time, the City of Portsmouth Boys' School also developed its own Combined Cadet Force as well as securing land to double the school sports field. In the mid-1980s the technology department was extended with a new building above for the new school art department. In 1988 the City of Portsmouth Boys' School was again extended. A new music department and a new food technology department were constructed to the side of the 'main' quad building and science tower. After the education act of 1996 the school chose to become a grant maintained status school, investing financial authority in the school governors. In 1999 the school had saved enough money to build a new maths department separate from the main school complex and consisting of eight new classrooms. The old maths department, housed in temporary facilities since the 1950s was demolished. The school is currently still a comprehensive but acquired Foundation status, giving extra grants to science, engineering, maths and technology facilities. The engineering department of the schoolachieved \\"specialist status\\", which was funded through a ¬£45,000 donation from BAE Systems to help renovate the classrooms, facilities and computer access. Recent additions to the school building include a new security system a fence which encompasses the entire school facility as well as a keycard entrance system for pupils and teachers. In February 2007, the school hosted a design competition in which a design was chosen for a statue of the Victorian era engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The carbon-coated stainless steel sculpture is currently being built at HMS Sultan in Gosport and was unveiled in March 2013 in St George's Square, Portsea. The school has also taken part in charity events. A tutor in 2007 donated over ¬£1000 to Cancer Research UK by putting on a charity variety show, named '9DXC and Friends Charity Variety Show'. It involved many teachers and the students of the before mentioned tutor group(9DXC). In late 2012 and 2013 many exterior elevations of the school were refurbished with new windows added to many of the classrooms. In April 2015 the school converted to academy status and was renamed Trafalgar School. In September 2015 the school began accepting girls as pupils, meaning that the school is now coeducational.

He began racing at the age of two and continued to compete until he was thirteen years old. During that time, he made 185 starts on virtually every race track in California as well as Mexico's Agua Caliente Racetrack. He won 32 times. Malicious was an $800 claimer. Owned by Mrs. E. Turk, he was trained for several years by Lonnie Coperhaver, known as the \\"King of the Gypsies.\\" Malicious was a closer who often came from far back to win. People started calling him \\"America's Two-Mile Champion,\\" and then the press discovered him. Running at the same time as Seabiscuit, Malicious was also the center of adoring fans. He made a personal appearance at San Francisco's 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition, had people promoting merchandise in his name, and was interviewed on the radio. To ensure that people would stay for a full day's racing, Santa Anita race track would include a two-miler as its last race of the day for Malicious to run in. Morton Cathro, a retired newspaperman, wrote of seeing Malicious in the last days of his career: \\"As a teenager in the autumn of 1939, this writer witnessed a series of Saturday marathons at Bay Meadows for top routers. Old Malicious showed up for the Nov. 11 finale, the four-mile Thornton Stakes. The weary road warrior, who hadn't started since that spring at Santa Anita, made his patented late surge to gain fourth in a blanket finish. That was his final race in the U.S. On Jan. 28, 1940, at age 13, one of the toughest iron horses of all time closed out his gallant career--a marathon in itself--by running second at Agua Caliente. His final paycheck was $100; his legacy, a claimer's place in the pantheon of sound, stout-hearted stakes horses--and in the hearts of a devoted public.\\" Malicious earned a total of $14,755.

As such, its main effects are to modify the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 c. 48 (\\"the 1988 Act\\") with minor consequential modifications to other Acts and secondary legislation. The regulations modify the concept of broadcast and broadcasting to take account of development in the internet; restrict the acts which are permitted without infringing copyright (in particular acts which could be performed commercially); and provide new measures for the protection and enforcement of copyright and performers' rights. Only two EU Member States met the 22 December 2002 deadline for implement, the UK implemented the directive in 2003 but in November 2004 was convicted for non-implementation of the directive in the territory of Gibraltar.  Broadcasts  Regulation 4 provides a new definition of \\"broadcast\\" in section 6 of the 1988 Act as : an electronic transmission of visual images, sounds or other information which‚Äî :: (a) is transmitted for simultaneous reception by members of the public and is capable of being lawfully received by them, or :: (b) is transmitted at a time determined solely by the person making the transmission for presentation to members of the public, Internet transmissions are excepted from the definition of a broadcast unless they are transmitted simultaneously with a broadcast by other means, simultaneously with a live event or form part of a service in which programmes are transmitted at specific times determined solely by the person providing the service. The new definition covers the old definitions of broadcast and of \\"cable programme\\" (s. 7 of the 1988 Act). However the separate definition of cable programme is kept as there is a distinction in the dates at which copyright becomes available: 1995-01-01 for cable programmes as opposed to 1956-06-01 for broadcasts under the previous definition.  Communication to the public  The previous \\"infringement by broadcasting or inclusion in a cable programme\\" (s. 20 of the 1988 Act) is replaced by a new \\"infringement by communication to the public\\" (reg. 6). This includes both broadcasting (under the new definition) and making a work available to the public by electronic transmission. A performer's rights are also infringed if his performance is made available to the public without his consent (reg; 7; new s. 182CA of the 1988 Act).  Permitted acts and copyright exceptions  Neither copyright (except in a computer program or a database) nor performer's rights are infringed by the simple act of transmitting the work between third parties over a network, even if the process of transmission involves making temporary copies (reg. 8) The existing fair dealing for the purposes of research or private study (s. 29 of the 1988 Act) was limited so that it is only permitted for a non-commercial purpose (reg. 9). A similar restriction was imposed on permitted copying by librarians (ss. 38, 39, 43 of the 1988 Act; reg. 14) or archivists of folksongs (s. 61 of the 1988 Act; reg. 16) for third parties. The observation or study of the functioning of a computer program was removed from the remit of fair dealing (reg. 9) and replaced by a statutory permission to study the functioning of the program while legally performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program (reg. 15; new s. 50BA of the 1988 Act). It was clarified that fair dealing for the purposes of criticism, review or news reporting is only allowed for published works (reg. 10). The permitted use without a licence of copyright material for educational use (ss. 32, 35, 36 of the 1988 Act) was restricted to non-commercial purposes (regs. 11‚Äì13). Regulation 18 removes the permission to use third parties (e.g. outside DJs) to play sound recordings for the purposes of a non-commercial club or society (s. 67 of the 1988 Act). The exception for public showing or playing of broadcasts of music (s. 72 of the 1988 Act) was also permitted, and the Secretary of State was enabled to propose a licensing scheme covering such public showing or playing, which may be compulsory (reg. 21).  Technical measures  New s. 296 of the 1988 Act created new rights in respect of copyright works to which copy protection measures have been applied. This right is held concurrently by: * any person issuing copies of the work to the public or communicating the work to the public; and * the owner of the copyright in the work, or his exclusive licensee; and * the owner of any intellectual property right in the technical device or measure, or his exclusive licensee. * who have the same rights against an infringement of this right as the owner of copyright has against infringement of copyright, including seizure. The right is infringed: * with respect to protected computer programs, by a person who \\"manufactures for sale or hire, imports, distributes, sells or lets for hire, offers or exposes for sale or hire, advertises for sale or hire or has in his possession for commercial purposes\\" any means \\"the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of the technical device\\" or who publishes information intended to enable or assist other in removing or circumventing the technical device (new s. 296 of the 1988 Act); * with respect to other protected works, by a person who knowingly circumvents the technical measures (new s. 296ZA of the 1988 Act); *by a person who manufactures, imports, distributes, sells or advertises any device or product which, or provides services which: ** are promoted or marketed for the purpose of circumventing such measures; or ** have only limited commercial significance beyond circumventing such measures; or ** are primarily designed, produced, adapted or performed for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of such measures (new s. 296ZD of the 1988 Act). The new section 296ZB established the criminal offenses of: * manufacturing for sale or hire, importation, sale or distribution of devices or products which are primarily designed or adapted for the purpose of the circumvention of technological measures; * providing, promoting, advertising or marketing a service the purpose of which is to enable or facilitate the circumvention of technical measures. The new section 296ZC allows the use of search warrants and forfeiture with respect to these offenses. The new section 296ZE created a remedy via complaint to the Secretary of State if a technical device or measure prevents a person or group of people from carrying out a permitted act with relation to the work. The Secretary of State may issue a direction to the owner of the copyright to take such measures as are necessary to enable the permitted act to be carried out. The breach of such a direction is actionable as a breach of statutory duty.  Rights management information  New s. 296ZG of the 1988 Act created new rights in respect of electronic rights management information metadata. The right is infringed by: * the person who knowingly removes electronic copyright management information which is associated with a copy of a copyright work, or appears in connection with the communication to the public of a copyright work; * the person who knowingly distributes or communicates to the public copies of a work from which electronic rights management information has been removed.  Enforcement of copyright and performer's rights  The infringement of copyright or performer's rights by making a work available to the public in the course of a business or to an extent which prejudicially affects the copyright owner becomes a criminal offense (reg. 26; new s. 107(2A) of the 1988 Act). A copyright holder may obtain an injunction (Scots law: interdict) against an Internet service provider (ISP) who has \\"actual knowledge\\" of another person using their service to infringe copyright or a performer's right. In determining whether the ISP has actual knowledge of the infringing use, the High Court (or Court of Session in Scotland) shall take into account all matters which appear to be relevant, in particular whether the ISP has received notification under regulation 6(1)(c) of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 No. 2013 (reg. 27; new ss. 97A, 191JA of the 1988 Act). Regulation 28 extended the right to bring action for infringement of copyright to non-exclusive licensees (it was previously limited to copyright owners and exclusive licensees) when the infringement is directly connected to a prior licensed act by the licensee and the licence expressly grants a right of action (new s. 101A of the 1998 Act). The non-exclusive licensee shall have the same rights and remedies as the copyright owner would have in any action. The right of the non-exclusive licensee to bring action is concomitant with that of the copyright owner.  Duration of protection  Regulation 29 amends section 13A of the 1988 Act to take account of the new definition of \\"communication to the public\\" so that the copyright in sound recordings expires: * at the end of the period of fifty years from the end of the calendar year in which the recording is made, or * if during that period the recording is published, fifty years from the end of the calendar year in which it is first published, or * if during that period the recording is not published but is made available to the public by being played in public or communicated to the public, fifty years from the end of the calendar year in which it is first so made available.

See also: movable type. Contemporary typographers view typography as a craft with a very long history tracing its origins back to the first punches and dies used to make seals and currency in ancient times. The basic elements of typography are at least as old as civilization and the earliest writing systems--a series of key developments that were eventually drawn together into one, systematic craft. __TOC__ Medieval design roots First page of the first volume of the Gutenberg Bible, printed with an early textur typeface c. 1455. In this copy the decorative colored initials were hand-lettered separately by a scribe. Typography, type-founding and typeface design began as closely related crafts in mid-15th-century Europe with the introduction of movable type printing at the junction of the medieval era and the Renaissance. Handwritten letterforms of the mid-15th century embodied 3000 years of evolved letter design, and were the natural models for letterforms in systematized typography. The scribal letter known as textur or textualis, produced by the strong gothic spirit of blackletter from the hands of German area scribes, served as the model for the first text types. Johannes Gutenberg employed the scribe Peter Sch√∂ffer to help design and cut the letterpunches for the first typeface--the D-K type of 202 characters used to print the first printed books in Europe. A second typeface of about 300 characters designed for the 42-line Bible c. 1455 was probably cut by the goldsmith Hans Dunne with the help of two others--G√∂tz von Shlettstadt and Hans von Speyer. Cultural tradition ensured that German typography and type design remained true to the gothic/blackletter spirit; but the parallel influence of the humanist and neo-classical typography in Italy (the second country where movable type printing was done) catalyzed textur into four additional sub-styles that were distinct, structurally rich and highly disciplined: Bastarda, fraktur, rotunda, and Schwabacher. The rapid spread of movable type printing across Europe produced additional Gothic, half-Gothic and Gothic-to-Roman transitional types. Johann B√§mler's Schwabacher, Augsburg appeared in 1474. The half-Gothic Rotunda type of Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 was cut to suit Venetian taste. In 1476 William Caxton, having learned his craft on the Continent, printed the first books in England with a so-called B√¢tarde type (an early Schwabacher design), but soon abandoned it.printing in England The early printers of Spain were Germans who began by printing in up-to-date roman types but soon gave these up and adopted Gothic typefaces based on the letterforms of Spanish manuscripts. Valencia in the Kingdom of Aragon was the location of the first press, established in 1473. From there printers moved to other cities to set up presses. Roman types were used by the printers of Salamanca for their editions of classical authors. Printing in Portuguese began at Lisbon in 1495 (the first book printed in Portugal was a Hebrew book printed in 1489).Steinberg, S. H. (1961) Five Hundred Years of Printing. Harmondsworth: Penguin; pp. 94, 96, 98 Classical revival In Italy, the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by Venetian or \\"old style\\" Latin types, also called antiqua. The inscriptional capitals on Roman buildings and monuments were structured on a euclidean geometric scheme and the discrete component-based model of classical architecture. Their structurally perfect design, near-perfect execution in stone, balanced angled stressing, contrasting thick and thin strokes, and incised serifs became the typographic ideal for western civilization. The best-known example of Roman inscriptional capitals exists on the base of Trajan's Column, inscribed c. 113. Roman inscriptional capitals on the base of Trajan's Column, c. 113. In their enthusiastic revival of classical culture, Italian scribes and humanist scholars of the early 15th century searched for ancient lower case letters to match the Roman inscriptional capitals. Practically all of the available manuscripts of classical writers had been rewritten during the Carolingian Renaissance, and with a lapse of three hundred years since the widespread use of this style, the humanist scribes mistook Carolingian minuscule as the authentic writing style of the ancients. Dubbing it lettera antica, they began by copying the minuscule hand almost exactly, combining it with Roman capitals in the same manner as the manuscripts they were copying.Nesbitt, Alexander The History and Technique of Lettering (c) 1957, Dover Publications, Inc. . The Dover edition is an abridged and corrected republication of the work originally published in 1950 by Prentice-Hall, Inc. under the title Lettering: The History and Technique of Lettering as Design. Carolingian Gospel Book produced between 820 and 830 AD Upon noticing the stylistic mismatch between these two very different letters, the scribes redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time moveable type reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as humanistic minuscule, which served as the basis for type style we know today as Venetian. Transition from humanistic minuscule to roman type The classically endowed city of Rome attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany, Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim, closely followed by the brothers Johann and Wendelin of Speyer (de Spira), and the Frenchman Nicolas Jenson. The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty; all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing, and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to Venice. Some time before 1472 in Venice, Johann and Wendelin issued material printed with a half-Gothic-half-roman type known as \\"Gotico-antiqua\\". This design paired simplified Gothic capitals with a rationalized humanistic minuscule letter set, itself combining Gothic minuscule forms with elements of Carolingian, in a one step forward, half step back blending of styles. Around the same time (1468) in Rome, Pannartz and Sweynheim were using another typeface that closely mimicked humanistic minuscule, known as \\"Lactantius\\". Unlike the rigid fractured forms of Speyer's half-Gothic, the Lactantius is characterized by smoothly rendered letters with a restrained organic finish. The Lactantius a departed from both the Carolingian and Gothic models; a vertical backstem and right-angled top replaced the diagonal Carolingian structure, and a continuous curved stroke replaced the fractured Gothic bowl element. For details on the evolution of lower case letterforms from Latin capitals, see Latin alphabet. Development of roman type Nicolas Jenson began printing in Venice with his original roman font from 1470. Jenson's design and the very similar roman types cut by Francesco Griffo c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and archetypal roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed. The Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful abstract stylization. The carefully modelled serifs follow an artful logic of asymmetry. The ratio of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious body of type. Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic \\"white space\\") with figures (letters) to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic. Nicolas Jenson's roman type used in Venice c. 1470. Later \\"old style\\" or Venetian book romans such as Aldines, and much later Bembo, were closely based on Jenson. The name \\"roman\\" is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman \\"antiqua\\" from its connection with the humanistic \\"lettera antica\\"; \\"medieval\\" and \\"old-style\\" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by Aldus Manutius (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian. Italic type The humanist spirit driving the Renaissance produced its own unique style of formal writing, known as \\"cursiva humanistica\\". This slanted and rapidly written letter evolved from humanistic minuscule and the remaining Gothic current cursive hands in Italy, served as the model for cursive or italic typefaces. As books printed with early roman types forced humanistic minuscule out of use, cursiva humanistica gained favor as a manuscript hand for the purpose of writing. The popularity of cursive writing itself may have created some demand for a type of this style. The more decisive catalyst was probably the printing of pocket editions of Latin classics by Aldus Manutius. The \\"Aldino\\" italic type, commissioned by Manutius and cut by Francesco Griffo in 1499, was a closely spaced condensed type. Griffo's punches are a delicate translation of the Italian cursive hand, featuring letters of irregular slant angle and uneven height and vertical position, with some connected pairs (ligatures), and unslanted small roman capitals the height of the lower case t. The fame of Aldus Manutius and his editions made the Griffo italic widely copied and influential, although it was not the finest of the pioneer italics. The \\"Aldino\\" style quickly became known as \\"italic\\" from its Italian origin. Around 1527 the Vatican chancellery scribe Ludovico Arrighi designed a superior italic type and had the punches cut by Lauticio di Bartolomeo dei Rotelli. The more modular structure of Arrighi's italic and its few ligatures made it less a copy of the cursive hand than Griffo's. Its slightly taller roman capitals, a gentler slant angle, taller ascenders and wider separation of lines gave the elegant effect of refined handwriting. Italic type designed by Ludovico Arrighi, c. 1527. This elegant design inspired later French italic types. Surviving examples of 16th-century Italian books indicate the bulk of them were printed with italic types. By mid-century the popularity of italic types for sustained text setting began to decline until they were used only for in-line citations, block quotes, preliminary text, emphasis, and abbreviations. Italic types from the 20th century up to the present are much indebted to Arrighi and his influence on French designers. Swiss art historian Jakob Burckhardt described the classically inspired Renaissance modello of dual case roman and cursive italic types as \\"The model and ideal for the whole western world\\". Venetian pre-eminence in type design was brought to an end by the political and economic turmoil that concluded the Renaissance in Italy with the sack of Rome in 1527. Renaissance Germany and Switzerland Soon after 1500, roman typefaces began to gain popularity north of the Alps for printing of Latin literature. Johann Froben of Basel, Switzerland set up his press in 1491, and by about 1519 (when he printed Erasmus's famous edition of the Greek New Testament) he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German-speaking world and also in Spain and, to a lesser extent in England. His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized; it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials (often designed by distinguished artists) and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings‚ÄîFroben was the first to use such 'display faces' consistently, breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text. By using these large faces, Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole. Froben's italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect. These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique. After about 1550 this Swiss/German tradition was gradually overwhelmed by French influence. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Wechel family of Frankfurt, previously based in Paris, was producing fine books which used French typefaces in conjunction with heavy but resplendent woodcut ornaments to achieve a splendid page effect; but soon after 1600 there was a general, marked decline in the quality of both skill and materials, from which German printing did not recover until the 20th century. 16th century France Typography was introduced to France by the German printers Martin Crantz, Michael Freyburger and Ulrich Gering, who set up a press in Paris in 1470, where they printed with an inferior copy of the Lactantius type. Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the 15th century, when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs. Jodocus Badius Ascensius (Josse Bade) in partnership with Henri Estienne established a press in Paris in 1503. Printing with undeveloped Roman and half-Gothic types, the French pair were too occupied meeting the demand for Humanistic and classical texts to design any original types of their own. French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers, and Lyon and Paris became the new centers of activity. Eventually, the French government fixed a standard height for all type, to ensure that different batches could be used together. De Colines, Estienne, and Augereau After their 1494 invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture, and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo-classical. The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late 1520s. At the end of this period roman types introduced by Robert Estienne, Simon de Colines and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character. Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne, who had died in 1520. Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne's assistant, married his widow, and set up his own press. The de Colines roman of 1531 resembled Griffo's 1499 roman but did not copy it closely. Narrower forms and tighter letter fit; a with low angled bowl; elevated triangular stem serifs on i, j, m, n and r; flattened baseline serifs, delicately modeled ascender serifs and graceful, fluid lines characterize the French style. Robert Estienne's roman of 1532 was similar to the de Colines face, which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi. The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified. In 1532 Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne's. The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post- Renaissance old style typography, and were copied by French typographers for the next 150 years. Garamond Garamond type revival by Robert Slimbach. The svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best-known figure of French typography--Claude Garamond (also Garamont). In 1541 Robert Estienne, printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King Francis I of France, known as the \\"grecs du roi\\". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch- cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, Christoffel Plantijn and the printer Andr√© Wechel, the types known as \\"Canon de Garamond\\" and \\"Petit Canon de Garamond\\" shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as Claude Garamond's final roman types. Robert Granjon Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi in Arabic, 1590, with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon, Typographia Medicea, Rome. Robert Granjon worked in the second half of the 16th century, mainly at Lyon, but was also recorded at Paris, Rome and Antwerp. He is still famous because of his Civilit√© types, imitating French gothic cursive calligraphy. His main contribution was an italic type known as \\"Parangon de Granjon\\". Italic type design had apparently become corrupted since the Arrighi and Aldine models. Granjon's italic had a greater slant angle, slanted roman capitals, and reduced weight and rigor. These qualities and its contrasting thick and thin strokes gave it a dazzling appearance that made it difficult to read. It was nevertheless the main influence for italic type design until the Arrighi model was revived in 1920. In the 16th century, Western printers also developed Oriental types, such as Fran√ßois Savary de Br√®ves or Robert Granjon, usually with the objective of proselytizing the Catholic faith.Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library & Renaissance Culture/ Orient to Rome Transition to modern type: 17th and 18th century Baroque and rococo aesthetic trends, use of the pointed-pen for writing, and steel engraving techniques effected a gradual shift in typographic style. Contrast between thick and thin strokes increased. Tilted stressing transformed into vertical stressing; full rounds were compressed. Blunt bracketed serifs grew sharp and delicate until they were fine straight lines. Detail became clean and precise. Transitional roman types combined the classical features of lettera antiqua with the vertical stressing and higher contrast between thick and thin strokes characteristic of the true modern romans to come. The roman types used c. 1618 by the Dutch printing firm of Elzevir in Leyden reiterated the 16th-century French style with higher contrast, less rigor and a lighter page effect. After 1647 most Elzevir faces were cut by the highly regarded Christoffel van Dyck, whose precise renditions were regarded by some experts at the time as finer than Garamond's. Fell types Specimen of Fell type English roman, quoting Cicero's First Oration against Catiline. From mid-16th century until the end of the 17th, interference with printing by the British Crown thwarted the development of type founding in England--most type used by 17th-century English printers was of Dutch origin. The lack of material inspired Bishop of Oxford Doctor John Fell to purchase punches & matrices from Holland c. 1670-1672 for use by the Oxford University Press. The so-named Fell types, presumed to be the work of Dutch punchcutter Dirck Voskens, mark a noticeable jump from previous designs, with considerably shorter extenders, higher stroke contrast, narrowing of round letters, and flattened serifs on the baseline and descenders. The design retained a retrogressive old-style irregularity, smooth modeling from vertical to horizontal, and angled stressing of rounds (except a vertically stressed o). Fell capitals were condensed, even-width, with wide flattened serifs; all characteristics of the definitive modern romans of the late 18th century. Fell italic types were distinguished by high contrast matching the Fell romans; wider ovals; a split- branching stroke from the stems of m n r and u; and long, flat serifs-- prefiguring modern. They repeated the non-uniform slant of French models, and the capitals included swash J and Q forms. An open-source digitisation of the Fell Types has been released by designer and engineer Igino Marini. Caslon Caslon English roman, from a sample issued by the Caslon foundry and quoting the same text. Compare against the Fell type. The first major figure in English typography is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single-handedly. The gun engraver- turned-punchcutter William Caslon spent 14 years creating the stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in 1734. The complete canon included roman, italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic etc. Caslon's Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types and the roman of Mikl√≥s (Nicholas) Kis c. 1685 falsely attributed to Anton Janson. Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly bracketed serifs and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm--its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however. Caslon's italic structures follow the Fell italics, but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems. William Caslon's prodigious output was influential worldwide. Caslon type and its imitations were used throughout the expanding British empire. It was the dominant type in the American colonies for the second half of the 18th century. Caslon marks the rise of England as the center of typographic activity. Fleischmann Joan Micha√´l Fleischman (1701-1768) was born in N√ºrnberg where he trained as a punchcutter. He found employment with Dutch type founders in Holland and settled there c. 1728. At the Ensched√© foundry in Haarlem he cut punches for a large amount of material. Some time after 1743 he produced a distinguished roman design--related to the preceding transitional types but departing from them. It prefigured modern romans with sparse transaxial modeling joining the vertical stressing to hairline thins, and ball-ends. Fleischmann borrowed from the general mode of Phillipe Grandjean's and Louis Simonneau's \\"Romain du Roi,\\" commissioned by Louis XIV in 1692 for the Imprimerie Royale, but did not imitate that face. Fleischmann's capitals were a new variety; an even-width scheme, compressed rounds, all-vertical stressing, and triangular beak ends of E F L T and Z, all characteristics prefiguring the \\"classical\\" moderns of Bodoni and Didot. Fleischmann's italic bore some resemblance to Granjean's but had longer ascenders and followed the established Dutch structures for h v and w. Fleischmann was held in great esteem by his contemporaries, his designs exerting a decisive influence in the last quarter of the 18th century. Renowned French punchcutter Pierre Simon Fournier (1712‚Äì1768), confessed to having copied Fleischmann's design, and was first to dub \\"contrast\\" types like the Fells, Caslon and Fleischmann \\"modern\\". Fournier's rococo-influenced designs--Fournier and Narcissus--and his Mod√®les des Caract√®res (1742) continued the romaine du roi style and adapted it for his own modern age. Like Baskerville, his italics were inspired by handwriting and the engraved lettering known as copperplate hand. Fournier also published a two volume Manuel Typographique, in which he recorded much European typographic history, and introduced the first standardized system of type size measurement--the \\"point\\". Baskerville The Baskerville typeface designed by John Baskerville. The roman and italic types of John Baskerville c. 1772 appeared later than Fleischman's but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with a return to lower contrast, smooth transaxial modeling, finely modeled bracketed serifs, and long stems. The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called Mrs Eaves, is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves. Modern romans Facsimile of sample published with genuine Bodoni types by the Officina Bodoni in 1925. The font shown is the digital Bodoni Monotype c. 1999.Linotype foundry. True modern romans arrived with the types of the Italian Giambattista Bodoni and the French Didots. Completing trends begun by the Fell types, Fleischman, Fournier and Baskerville, the so-called \\"classical\\" modern romans eschewed chirographic and organic influences, their synthetic symmetric geometry answering to a rationalized and reformed classical model driven by the strict cartesian grid philosophy of Ren√© Descartes and the predictable clockwork universe of Isaac Newton. The \\"classical\\" appellation of modern romans stems from their return to long ascenders and descenders set on widely spaced lines, and a corresponding light page effect reminiscent of old-style-- occurring at a time of classical revival. Bodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style. He produced an italic very close to Baskerville's, and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts. The roman types of Francois Ambroise Didot and son Firmin Didot closely resemble the work of Bodoni, and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans. At any rate the Didots' mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the \\"enlightenment\\" of post-revolution France under Napoleon. Francois Ambroise also designed \\"maigre\\" and \\"gras\\" types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats. The Spanish designer Joaqu√≠n Ibarra's roman was influenced by Baskerville, Didot and Bodoni, but hewn nearer to old-style and used in the same classical manner, including spaced capitals. In England modern romans resembling Bodoni's were cut for the printer William Bulmer c. 1786 by the punchcutter William Martin, who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him. Martin's italic mirrored the open-tail g and overall finesse of Baskerville's. In Britain and the United States, modern romans (emerging around 1800 and totally dominant by the 1820s) took a somewhat more rounded, less geometrical form than the designs of Didot and Bodoni; an obvious difference is that in Anglo-American faces the upper-case C has only one serif (at the top) whereas in European designs it has two.  19th and 20th century typography  Industrialization The 19th century brought fewer stylistic innovations. The most notable invention was the rise of typefaces with strengthened serifs. Forerunners were the so-called Egyptienne fonts, which were used already at the beginning of the 19th century. Their name likely comes from the enthusiasm of the Napoleonic era for the orient, which in turn was started by Napoleon's invasion in Egypt. In fact slab-serif fonts (e. g. Clarendon from 1845) were newspaper fonts, whose serifs were strengthened in order to prevent damage during the printing process. Stylistically the serif fonts of the mid-19th century appeared very robust and otherwise had more or less neo-classical design features, which changed during the course of time: By the application of the slab serif design feature and by appending serifs to more and more typefaces, an independent intermediate group of heterogeneous fonts emerged during the 20th century. Meanwhile, the slab serifs are listed as an independent group in most typeface classifications--besides both main groups serif and sans serif. Slab-serif and sanserif types were rarely used for continuous bodies of text; their realm was that of advertisements, title-pages and other attention-catching pieces of print. By about 1820, most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts. This remained true until the 1860s, when so- called 'old style' faces--a largely English-speaking phenomenon--came into use. These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces; 'thick' strokes were attenuated, and serifs at the end of thin strokes (as in C, E, L and T) were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so. All the upper-case characters were somewhat 'condensed' (narrowed). Old style faces remained popular until about 1910. Above all the 19th century was innovative regarding technical aspects. Automatic manufacturing processes changed the print as well as the graphical illustrations. The illustration of printed matters could be considerably standardised due to the lithography technique invented by Alois Senefelder. Finally, another invention was photography, whose establishment at the end of the 19th century led to the first halftoning and reproduction procedures. The step-by-step development of a modern mass society provided a growing demand of printed matters. Besides the traditional letterpress beginnings of a newspaper landscape as well as a broad market for publications, advertisements, and posters of all kinds appeared. The challenges had changed: since printing and typography had been a straightforward craft for centuries, it now had to face the challenges of an industry-ruled mass society. Hot type and phototypesetting in the 20th century Monotype machine Exlibris, 1921 The 90 years between 1890 and 1980 coined typography until now. The craft of printing became an industry, and the typography became a part of it as well. Both stylistically and technologically this epoch was really tumultuous. The significant developments were the following: *The fabrication and application of typefaces more and more were affected by industrial manufacturing processes. Significant incidents were the invention of the hot type machine by Ottmar Mergenthaler (Linotype machine, 1886) and Tolbert Lanston (Monotype machine, 1887) and a few decades later the emergence of phototypesetting. The result: Compilation and typographical design of the text could be more and more controlled by keyboards in contrast to manual typesetting. *A result of the industrialisation process was the unimagined number and distribution of new typefaces. Whether digital variants of Garamond and Bodoni or new contemporary type designs like Futura, Times, and Helvetica, nearly all currently used typefaces have their origin either in the following and ongoing digital typesetting era or are based on designs of this epoch. The basis was the appearance of large type foundries and type manufacturers. The result: Successful typefaces could quickly gain the status of a trademark--and therefore were able to assign a unique \\"branding\\" to products or publications. *Besides the traditional typography of books graphic design became a more or less independent branch. The tensions between those two branches significantly determined the stylistic development of 20th century's typography. Art nouveau and New Book Art Eckmann, 1901. Since impressionism the modern art styles were reflected in graphic design and typography too. Since 1890 the Art nouveau became popular. Its floral ornaments, the curved forms, as well as the emphasis on graphical realisation inspired the type designers of the start of the 20th century. A popular art nouveau font was the Eckmann designed by graphic artist Otto Eckmann. Furthermore, the influence of art nouveau was expressed in a lot of book illustrations and exlibris designs. Altogether the return to the roots of book art become stronger around the start of the 20th century. It was initiated by British typographer, socialist, and private press publisher William Morris as well as by the Arts and Crafts Movement, which refers to him. Essentially this movement initiated three things: a return to the antiqua-models of the Renaissance, clarity and simplicity of book illustrations, and straightforward technical processes during the production of printed matters. An immediate consequence of the Arts and Crafts Movement was the establishment of the private press movement, which more or less was committed to Morris' ideals, and whose remains partially are still present today. An established meeting point of this scene in Germany for example is the Mainzer Minipressen-Messe, which actually is held every two years. Especially the New Book Art movement, which formed in the decade before World War I, was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. The young type designers of the pre-war era, among them Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke and Friedrich Wilhelm Kleukens, rejected both the late typographical classicism and the ornaments of the popular Art nouveau. The new ideal became a tidy and straightforward book typography, which dedicated itself to the ideas of the Renaissance. Walter Tiemann in Leipzig, Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler in Stuttgart, and Rudolf Koch in Offenbach as instructors were the mentors of this kind of typography. They stayed influential in the field of book typesetting until a long time after the end of World War II. European avant-garde typography During the 1920s, typographers in central and eastern Europe experimented with forms of avant-garde typography. The main places of development of avant-garde artists had been: Budapest, Zagreb, Belgrade and, after 1924, also Prague. However, since 1925 avant-garde typography had been spreading to the cities of western and eastern Europe and, as a result, the previous cities gradually lost their relevance. In 1924 two exhibitions important for development of avant-garde typography were organized: one by Ljubomir Miciƒá (the First International Zenitistic Exhibition of New Art in Belgrade) and the other by Ion Vinea and Marcel Iancu (the First International Exhibition Contimporanul).  Avant-garde typography in Poland  Among the most important Polish artists were W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski and Mieczys≈Çaw Szczuka ‚Äì in their works they were referring to poetry and valued the art of publishing (printing) books more than other forms of art. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski is recognized as the precursor of avant-garde typography in Poland ‚Äì he was one of the first artists to set aside the primal shape of letters. He thought the content was not as important as the way it was presented because in order to understand the message of a poster/cover, one had to understand what the artist tried to communicate with the arrangement of words or each letter. The inscriptions started to be constructed in a way to catch the eye ‚Äì unlike ‚Äútraditional‚Äù typography which was perceived as an addition to a text. As a form of inspiration, architecture also began to lose its value because avant-garde artists were drawing their ideas from paintings and graphics. Jan Tschichold, the creator of one of many definitions and the most known theoretician of avant-garde typography stated that its basic rules should be lack of symmetry, contrast and total freedom of creation. Contrary to other genres of art, avant-garde creators were also its theoreticians and researchers.

Route description State Highway 89 begins at the Taovayas Indian Bridge on the Illinois Bend of the Red River, continuing Farm to Market Road 677 from Texas. One mile (1.6 km) north of the river, it intersects SH-32 at Courtney. SH-89 overlaps SH-32 for , initially headed due west, but curving around to the northwest and eventually the north, crossing into Jefferson County and passing through unincorporated Petersburg. SH-32 then angles off to the northwest while SH-89 continues on a due north course. After splitting off to the north, SH-89 travels through eastern Jefferson County for , generally paralleling the county line. The highway continues along a rough northerly heading, though it briefly heads northwest at times. SH-89 runs to the east of the town of Cornish, and then intersects US-70 as it enters Ringling. After passing through the town, it curves northwest. SH-89 then turns back to a due north course, which it will maintain for the rest of its existence. The highway comes to an end north of Ringling at SH-53 east of Loco. History State Highway 89 was first added to the Oklahoma state highway system on July 26, 1944. The original extent of the highway was from the current northern junction with SH-32 to US-70 in Ringling. These remained the route's termini until January 21, 1957, when it was extended north through Ringling to SH-53, setting its northern terminus at its present location. Minor realignments would take place during the next two years, after which the highway would remain the same for three decades. On September 6, 1994, the highway was extended south. SH-89 now overlapped SH-32 to Courtney, where it split away towards its new southern terminus at the Texas state line. The highway has undergone no further changes since this extension.

Louis Comfort Tiffany made use of such textured glass to represent, for example, water or leaf veins. The texture is created during the glass sheet-forming process. A sheet is formed from molten glass with a roller that spins on itself, while travelling forward. Normally the roller spins at the same speed as its own forward motion, and the resulting sheet has a smooth surface. In the manufacture of rippled glass, the roller spins faster than its own forward motion. The rippled effect is retained as the glass cools. In order to cut rippled glass, the sheet may be scored on the smoother side with a carbide glass cutter, and broken at the score line with breaker-grozier pliers.

Located on the Eastern Shore along Route 316, Goldboro is approximately 16 kilometres west of the shire town of Guysborough.  Mining and energy developments  In 1861 gold was discovered in quartz veins on the Isaac's Harbour anticline to the east of the community. All together 14 mines were developed in this area producing some 140,000 ounces of reported production. Production ceased in 1941 with the closure of the Lower Seal Harbour Mine. In 1892, Howard Richardson was the first to note gold within shale and quartz veins which became generally known as the Boston Richardson Belt. Mining on the property began in 1892 when the Richardson Gold Mining Company started developing the belt and continued until 1912. In 1985 exploration re-commenced on the Upper Seal Harbour gold district and in 1988 extensive surface and underground work was carried out by Orex Exploration. The property has seen several developers look at it from an open pit potential, but all to date have dropped their options. At present Anaconda Mining is conducting an extensive exploration program for gold in the surrounding areas including the former Boston Richardson Mine, Dolliver Mountain Mine, West Goldbrook Mine and East Goldbrook Mines. Plans are to develop an 800 TPD open pit and underground operation producing around 41,000 ounces per year. During the late 1990s, Goldboro was selected as the eastern terminus for the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline which connects to the Sable Offshore Energy Project (SOEI) gas plant. Goldboro has been marketed as the energy hub of Nova Scotia. The Sable project is now facing end of life closing, as is the Encana Deep Panuke project. The Sable proponents have commenced decommissioning activities of the offshore facilities and will cease production some time in 2019. In 2012 Pieridae Energy announced it planned to develop a two train 10 million ton per annum LNG plant and associated facilities. The pre-development work is complete and a final investment decision expected by the end of 2018 or early 2019 with production by 2022.

Stuart Gardener is the CEO of the Thinking Schools Academy Trust.  History  1890‚Äì1975 The original school building was St Mary's School build circa 1890. It first became a school for girls in 1930 as the Junior Girls Department of the nearby Penhale Road Board School. The building became one of the early casualties of bombing in Portsmouth during World War II and was subsequently demolished. With post-war reorganisation resulting from the Education Act 1944, the Kingston Modern School for Girls was created in 1949. This was initially based at the Penhale Road site rather than the St Mary's site and had 250 girls on roll. This figure soon increased until it became impossible to accommodate the number of pupils. By 1954, with numbers still increasing, it became clear that a new building would be necessary at the St Mary's site. The new Kingston Modern School for Girls building opened on its present site in 1957. It cost ¬£105,821 to build and consisted of a main three-story block with 20 classrooms including specialist rooms for science, art, craft and domestic science and a library. There was also a hall, stage and a dining area (now the foyer), and a gymnasium (now the dining hall). The site was much smaller then, being surrounded to the north and west by houses that no longer exist today. Numbers of pupils continued to increase and a new extension which is now the current Science and Technology block was completed in the 1960s. 1975‚Äì1994 In 1975 education in Portsmouth was again reorganised resulting in the creation of the City of Portsmouth Girls' School as a comprehensive school for girls between the ages of 12 to 16. As a result, the site increased in size again, with a large sports field (which used to be housing), a new sports hall, and another new complex, which is now the humanities block. 1994‚Äì2001 In 1994 education was once again reorganised in Portsmouth and the school became an 11‚Äì16 comprehensive school, taking girls from age 11. To accommodate additional numbers, another new block for teaching Modern Foreign Languages and Technology was added, together with the all-weather multi-sport pitch, completed in 1998. practice rooms, additional office space and a new changing room for the Dance Studio was completed in February 2001. 2006‚Äìpresent In 2006 the 'Training & Learning Centre' was built on the school grounds. This building is used by the school for lessons and other activities and is also open to bookings from the local council as well as private individuals and groups. The centre contains offices, a fully equipped Information Technology suite, classrooms and conference room. The school achieved specialist Humanities College status in 2008, and converted to academy status in September 2013. The school was then renamed Portsmouth Academy for Girls. In September 2017, the academy welcomed its first cohort that included boys.

In late spring 1862, Cincinnati city officials recognized the threat of an attack from Confederate forces under the command of Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan, who was riding northward through Kentucky apparently intent on crossing the Ohio River into Indiana and/or Ohio. Numerous militia groups had been organized, but the threat of nearly 2,000 veteran cavalrymen riding into downtown Cincinnati prompted Mayor George Hatch to release a proclamation calling out the local citizenry into action for the defense of Cincinnati. :\\"In accordance with a resolution passed by the City Council of Cincinnati on the 1st instant, I hereby request that all business, of every kind or character, be suspended at ten o‚Äôclock of this day, that all persons, employers and employees, assemble in their respective wards, at the usual places of voting, and there organize themselves in such manner as may be thought best for the defense of the city. Every man, of every age, be he citizen or alien, who lives under the protection of our laws, is expected to take part in the organization. Witness my hand, and the corporate seal of the city of Cincinnati, this second day of September, A.D. 1862\\". At two o'clock on the morning of the same day, Mayor Hatch issued another proclamation, notifying the citizens that the police force would perform the duty of a provost-guard, under the direction of Gen. Lew Wallace. On September 2, 1862 despite the protests of Mayor George Hatch, the Army ordered a unit of black men, known as the Black Brigade of Cincinnati, to dig fortifications in Northern Kentucky.http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/09/04/loc_ohiodate0904.html Mayor Hatch's former home is located at 830 Dayton Street, in the Dayton Street Historic District.

The group has been operating in Iraq since the middle of 2003. Since then the group has carried out multiple attacks against coalition forces, using IEDs, and firing rockets and mortar bombs. The group's goals are to end the presence of US troops in the country, and the departure of all other coalition forces in the country. The group was suspected to have joined the Mujahideen Shura Council, but so far no conclusive evidence have pointed to a connection. On September 7, 2007 eight insurgency groups made a pact together and established a new umbrella group called Jihad and Reform Front\\". The groups are: 1\\\\. 1920 Revolution Brigade 2\\\\.

Battalions of Muhammed al-Fatih Established at the first day of the occupation, and began to collect weapons from the former Iraqi Army military camps in the suburbs of Baghdad, the Army announced its existence at the same day when its fighters carried out an attack against a US occupation patrol after nine days of the occupation of Baghdad. Al-Rashideen Army battalions are located in different parts of Iraq, including the provinces of North and South. Al-Rashideen Army claims that it does not stop with its military appearances, but go deep in understanding the occupation project, which is not aimed at Iraq alone. It thinks that the occupation program begins with the occupation of this country, and sequentially aims against Arabism and Islam everywhere. Al-Rashideen high commanders say that they are following these goals and motivations of occupation strategy and the role of the neo- conservatives and international Zionism. Based on the previous vision, Al- Rashideen Army puts its strategic vision, and identify its options and positions in the field according to a program aimed to achieving its near and far objectives. Al-Zubaidi (from the political office of Al-Rashedeen Army) said: \\"There is no doubt that Iran poses a major threat, but we believe that the danger is the first American occupation, The penetration and Iranian proliferation, happened because of the absence of American occupation and if we defeat the American occupation that would subside the Iranian threat, and if we defeat the US, we will be able to defeat all those who want to harm Iraq\\". As per the Al-Rashedeen Army opinion on \\"Awake councils\\", they define them as: American made, designed and producing in Rand institutions and others. Simple groups of local paid people fulfilling the order of Americans.http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/nefaalrashid0608.pdf Al-Rashedeen Media: Al-Rashedeen army had special media attendance among other Iraqi resistance groups, they are identified by their unique message delivery and they explain the media block strategy that American adopt as follows: > Americans put themselves in a rather critical pit when they have decided > blocking the media of the resistance in Iraq and imposing firm restrictions > on Iraqi, Arabian and International press. Furthermore, they sneak to all > websites belong to Iraqi resistance and shut them off. The objective of > American political, as well as, military administration is to hide the voice > of Iraqi resistance. Both had thought that these actions leave the space to > their media and for that matter the public weather here in Iraq or on the > international front will be receiving information from western or American > media. Accordingly, the real situation will never be told and all the facts > on the ground will be manipulated to serve the American administration. They publish their statements, resistance operations and special releases via their two websites: www.al-rashedeen.info (in Arabic) and www.al-rashedeen.net (in English). They had released many documentaries and special releases, here listing some of them: (1) The Lie That Destroyed A Country Its backdate a painful period of history of the country of letter, writing, history succession, culture Iraq which collaborated against him the Crusaders countries and their cronies from inside and outside, which they didn't come for the lie of \\"disarmament of weapons of mass destruction\\", nor for the lie of \\"removal of regime\\". (2) Bells of Danger Recording a very difficult period of time, showing the difficult ordeal and divine purification for Mujaheddin (fighters). And we in Al-Rashedeen Army promise our Lord to stay in the road of Jihad, fighting our enemy, supporting our brothers in Jihad, and exposing the traitors and hypocrites for the followers of the illusory political operation, without any fear or terror. (3) Code of Silence This release is oriented for the western people understanding and thinking as they have totally different ideas than ours. So, this is a unique release among Al- Rashedeen Army releases and other Mujaheddin brother releases.

History King Abdullah of Jordan first proposed the group in 2005. Objective The group of eleven is a forum, constituted by mostly developing countries aimed at easing their debt burden and narrowing the gap with rich countries to lift, ‚Äòmillions out of poverty‚Äô. The specific aim is to garner market access and writing off of the debt burden so that these countries can focus all their resources on generating growth and stability. Creation The group was created on 20 September 2006. The group comprises mostly lower-middle-income countries. Members The members consist of Jordan, Croatia, Ecuador, Georgia, El Salvador, Honduras, Indonesia, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, and Sri Lanka. The request is made to the G8. May 2007 summit G11 developing countries at their Summit at the Jordanian Dead Sea resort have agreed to push for cooperation with G8 industrialized nations to ease their debts and build prosperous economies. These countries and in fact most of the developing countries require fiscal and monetary space to maintain momentum on progress to lay the foundation for a diversified and sustainable economic growth. The group asked for exploring avenues for enhancing cooperation among member states to shape their future development needs and strategies as well as greater cooperation with international partners for market access, enhanced productive capacities and development of scientific and technological skills and converting debts to financing aid projects. G11 countries need targeted assistance and support from the developed countries to accelerate growth, lift millions from poverty and hasten the delivery of the fruits of reforms and social development to larger segments of their population. The G11 group need to enter into political dialogue with the G8 countries for their support to meet development objectives, encourage investment and have greater market access. Outstanding Debt on the developing countries places a great burden on export earnings and fiscal revenues. Moreover, tariffs imposed by the G8 and other developed countries on imports are the major hurdles in the way of improving the living standard of the peoples of the developing and under developed countries through export led growth. G11 proposal on debt The G11 argues that it is in the interest of the G8 and others to enter into arrangement with the indebted countries and convert the debts into assistance for social development projects so that the poor masses could reap the fruits of development. This would help in reducing the gap between the rich and the poor, create more job opportunities, alleviate poverty and contribute to creating an atmosphere of goodwill, fraternity and understanding among the peoples leading to the cherished objective of prosperity, peace and stability around the globe.

It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Texas Association of Boarding Schools. The Academy was founded in 1907; its mission is to educate young men and women within a nurturing community based upon Christian values. The Academy accepts boarding students in grades 6‚Äì12 and day students in grades K-12. Enrollment in 2009 was 274, with about 75% in the residence program. The school is located in the Texas Hill Country in San Marcos, Texas, United States, south of Austin, and north of San Antonio. San Marcos Academy is one of the oldest boarding schools in the state of Texas, and was established in 1907 by Texas Baptists with the support of the city of San Marcos. The Academy's first president was James Milton Carroll. The Academy has students matriculate at a wide range of colleges and universities. History After an organization drive that began in 1905, the Southwest Texas Baptist Conference established the school in 1907 by matching $25,000 raised by citizens of San Marcos. James Milton Carroll, a leader of the founding campaign, served the Academy as its first president. The school enrolled an entering class of 200 students on September 24, 1908. Carroll resigned in 1911; the Academy's original building, granted a state historical marker in 1970, became known as Carroll Hall. Thomas Green Harris succeeded Carroll, and the Christian Education Program of the Baptist General Convention of Texas began administrative oversight in 1911. After the United States entered World War I in 1917, the federal government granted the Academy a junior unit of the Reserve Officer Training Corps. For a time all male students were require to have served in the corps of cadets, and all those in grades nine through twelve are formally enrolled in the army Junior ROTC program, but it is no longer required. Girls have also participated in military training on an optional basis since 1973 when two students, Mary Shepard and Karen Stubbs led the development of the first female platoon. By 1936 the Academy's physical plant had increased to twelve buildings on a fifty-six-acre site valued at $400,000. Students in grades one through twelve studied general academic courses as well as fine arts and business subjects. In 1968 more than 500 students in grades three through twelve attended the Academy; in 1986 the enrollment was 240 boys in grades six through twelve and 120 girls in grades nine through twelve. Also in January 1982, under the administration of Jack E. Byrom the Academy moved from its location at the current Texas State University campus, to a more spacious lot on Ranch Road 12. The Academy has had students from a number of other states and foreign nations. Most Academy students reside in dormitories on campus and attend mandatory chapel services on Wednesdays, and devotionals on Mondays. Chapel services are currently optional for both boarding and day students, taking place at First Baptist Church on Sunday. Since the school's beginning, the Academy has accepted students from all religious faiths. Students of both sexes have competed in athletic events against other private schools. The academy is a member of the Texas Christian Athletic League and is accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the Texas Education Agency, and the accrediting commission of the Texas Association of Baptist Schools. A fifteen- member board of trustees selected by the Baptist General Convention of Texas continues to govern the Academy. Thirty-five full-time and twelve part-time teachers composed the faculty in 1993; three administrators supervised Academy operations. That year the endowment of the academy exceeded $3 million, and the institution's assets exceeded $15 million. After selling its original site and buildings to Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State) in 1979, the Academy moved to its present site.

The church is the oldest French Protestant church in Canada. The school produced many French-speaking Baptist ministers up to the time of the Second World War, and many of its graduates, both francophones and anglophones, went on to become well known in diverse fields in Canada. Second World War Feller ceased operations as a school during the Second World War (1942‚Äì1946) and was used as a prisoner-of-war camp for German officers. It reopened shortly after the war. After the war Feller accepted many English-speaking students and enjoyed considerable success as a truly bilingual institution. At the same time, its board had to face the problem of redefining its original mission. Ultimately it was unable to adapt to the new realities, and it closed in June 1967.

He was admitted on trial to the Michigan Annual Conference (which at that time covered northwestern Ohio as well) 7 September 1837. In 1840 he became a founding member of the North Ohio Annual Conference. When the conference boundaries were further realigned, he became a member of the Central Ohio Conference (aka the Delaware Ohio Conference). Harris served in Ohio for eight years as Pastor at, successively, Dover, Bellville, Amity, and Chesterville, and in 1844 was appointed to Delaware, Ohio. He also was an active abolitionist.

History  The former Serbia and Montenegro used the .yu domain when still called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In June 2006 Serbia and Montenegro split into two separate countries. On 8 July 2006 the Serbian Ministry of Science and a group of 34 interested organizations founded the National Internet Domain Registry - RNIDS. On 26 September 2006, the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency decided to allocate RS as the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for Serbia. IANA assigned .rs as the ccTLD for this country. The delegation of name servers by IANA started in September 2007. Registration of the .rs domain names commenced on 10 March 2008. In 2007 ICANN also resolved that RNIDS, the operators of the new .rs domain registry, should temporarily operate the former .yu domain until its eventual abolition on or before 30 September 2009. This allowed a two-year transition period for existing .yu names to transferred either to .rs for Serbia or to .me for Montenegro. The .yu domain finally expired on 30 March 2010. By 2018, it became convention for sites related to the Rust programming language to use .rs domain names, mimicking the file extension used for Rust source files.

Early life Parrish was born in the city of Kewanee, Illinois, the only son of Rufus Parker and Frances Adeline (Hollis) Parrish. He was born in \\"Rose Cottage\\" on June 10, 1858, at what was later the site of the city's Methodist Episcopal church. The old family home was at Gilmanton, New Hampshire, but Parrish' parents removed to Kewanee from Boston, where Rufus Parker Parrish had been engaged in business and was prominently associated with William Lloyd Garrison and others in the anti-slavery cause. Both parents had a wide acquaintance with the famous Boston citizens of that era, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., John Greenleaf Whittier, Wendell Phillips and Ralph Waldo Emerson.Henry L. Kiner. History of Henry County Illinois, Volume II. Chicago: Pioneer Publishing Co, 1910, pp. 24-28. The Parrish came to Kewanee, then the merest excuse of a village, in April, 1855; the husband becoming connected with the pioneer store of Morse & Willard, then situated at the corner of Main and Fourth streets. A little later the firm became Parrish & Faulkner, the business finally being sold to Elias Lyman, being thus the nucleus for the large department store of Lyman-Lay Company. From the time of arrival until his death in 1903, Rufus Parrish was ranked among the most prominent citizens of this community, where he conducted a book store and held many offices of trust. St John's Episcopal church was established and maintained largely through his efforts and for twenty-five years he was president of the public library board. Younger Parrish was educated in the Kewanee public schools, graduating from the old academy building in the second class, that of 1875, being on that occasion the class prophet. In addition he attended Allen's Academy at Lake Forest, Illinois, and Griswold College, Davenport, Iowa. Deciding upon law as a profession, he took one year at the Union College of Law, Chicago, completing his course at the Iowa State University, where he won the state bar prize for the best essay on a legal topic. He was admitted before the supreme court of Iowa in May, 1879, but his certificate was withheld until he became of age. Parrish went immediately to Wichita, Kansas, and became an assistant in the law office of William C. Little, a year later forming a partnership with E. S. Martin, at one time principal of the Kewanee high school. Devoting much time to politics and having achieved a reputation as a public speaker, he was elected city attorney, besides being a delegate to county and state conventions. Going west His health breaking down from close confinement, Parrish crossed the plains in 1882 with a cattle party, walking most of the way to Las Vegas, New Mexico. Arriving there he discovered conditions had arisen in Wichita which left him practically moneyless and compelled him to labor at anything possible. During the next few months he worked at track-laying, engine wiping and firing between Las Vegas and Albuquerque, on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, finally going as a sheep driver to Fort Sumner. He was camped on the outskirts of that place when Billy the Kid was killed by the sheriff of Lincoln County, and saw the desperado both before and after death. Joining a party of prospectors, the next few months were passed in the wildest regions of Arizona. Gold was found, but within the limits of an Apache reservation, and the party was driven out by United States soldiers. After suffering many hardships en route, Parrish reached Greeley, Colorado, and secured work on the Greeley-Loveland canal, a little later making his way to Denver. Here he became connected as a reporter with the Rocky Mountain News and began a newspaper career, extending over a number of years, serving for various periods with metropolitan and country publications and in every branch of the work. He worked at other times on the Grafton (Nebraska) Leader, Kewanee (Illinois) Courier and Independent, Sioux City (Iowa) Times, Omaha (Nebraska) World-Herald and the Chicago Times. Journalism and ministry In 1886, while managing editor of the Grafton (Nebraska) Leader, Parrish was persuaded to enter the Congregational ministry, being licensed by the Elkhorn Association and given charge of churches at Leigh and Howells, Nebraska. He was later ordained by the Blue Valley Association and held pastorates at Harvard, Nebraska, Mattoon, Illinois, Constantine, Michigan, and Marshalltown, Iowa. He was chairman of the Home Missionary Committee for Southern Illinois and one of the founders of Southern Collegiate Institute at Albion. In 1888 he stumped the entire state of Nebraska under the Republican state committee, accompanied by a double quartette of ladies, and later lectured extensively throughout many northern states. Literary career Front-page of Historic Illinois: the Romance of the Earlier Days (1905) During the winter of 1902, Parrish resumed newspaper work in Chicago, being first connected with the Associated Press, and later engaged in commercial journalism. The following spring he published his first work of fiction, When Wilderness Was King, through A. C. McClurg & Company, Chicago, also publishers of his subsequent books. This manuscript was submitted and accepted when but half completed and for a first book met with remarkable sale. All of his previous experience, the atmosphere of culture and refinement of his boyhood home, his literary and legal education, the hardships and privations which he endured upon the plains of the west, his campaign experiences and his labors in the ministry, all constituted a preparation and equipment for the work which he is now doing in the literary world, and which has made him one of the most successful of the modern writers. After the publication of his first book he devoted his entire time to literary work, having published the following books of fiction and history: My Lady of the North (1904); A Sword of the Old Frontier (1905); Bob Hampton of Placer (1906); Historic Illinois (1905); Beth Norvell (1907); The Great Plains (1907); Prisoners of Chance (1908); The Last Voyage of the Donna Isabel (1908); My Lady of the South (1909). Many of these have been credited among the \\"six best sellers,\\" and received high praise both at home and abroad. Later life Beginning in 1904, Parrish has made his home at Kewanee, in the old family house at 235 South Chestnut Street, which was built in 1859. He served as one of the directors of the Commercial Club, was leading knight of the local Elks Lodge, and was a frequent speaker at public meetings throughout Illinois. On August 9, 1923, he died at his home at Kewanee.The Editor, Volumes 62-63, 1923, p. vi. Family In 1887, Parrish was married to Miss Mary A. Hammon, of Clarkson, Nebraska, and four children were born unto this union, two of whom survived to adulthood, namely: Robert Arthur, a cadet at St. John's Military Academy, Delafield, Wisconsin; and Philip Hammon, of Lynch, Nebraska.

The connection can be made by a variety of different components: anchor bolts (also named fasteners), steel plates, or stiffeners. Anchor bolts transfer different types of load: tension forces and shear forces. A connection between structural elements can be represented by steel columns attached to a reinforced concrete foundation. A common case of a non-structural element attached to a structural one is the connection between a facade system and a reinforced concrete wall. Types Type of anchors Cast-in-place A cast-in-place anchor bolt The simplest - and strongest - form of anchor bolt is cast-in-place, with its embedded end consisting of a standard hexagonal head bolt and washer, 90-bend, or some sort of forged or welded flange (see also Stud welding). The last are used in concrete-steel composite structures as shear connectors. Other uses include anchoring machines to poured concrete floors and buildings to their concrete foundations. Various typically disposable aids, mainly of plastic, are produced to secure and align cast-in-place anchors prior to concrete placement. Moreover, their position must also be coordinated with the reinforcement layout. Different types of cast-in-place anchors might be distinguished: * Lifting inserts: used for lifting operations of plain or prestressed RC beams. The insert can be a threaded rod. See also Bolt (climbing). * Anchor channels: used in precast concrete connections. The channel can be a hot-rolled or a cold-formed steel shape in which a T-shape screw is placed in order to transfer the load to the base material. * Headed Stud: consist of a steel plate with headed studs welded on (see also Threaded rod). * Threaded sleeves: consist of a tube with an internal thread which is anchored back into the concrete. For all the type of the cast-in-place anchors, the load-transfer mechanisms is the mechanical interlock, i.e. the embedded part of the anchors in concrete transfers and the applied load (axial or shear) via bearing pressure at the contact zone. At failure conditions, the level of bearing pressure can be higher than 10 times the concrete compressive strength, if a pure tension force is transferred. Cast-in-place type anchors are also utilized in masonry applications, placed in wet mortar joints during the laying of brick and cast blocks (CMUs). Post-installed Post- installed anchors can be installed in any position of hardened concrete after a drilling operation. A distinction is made according to their principle of operation.  Mechanical Expansion anchors  A wedge anchor The force- transfer mechanism is based on friction mechanical interlock guaranteed by expansion forces. They can be furtherly divided into two categories: * torque controlled: the anchor is inserted into the hole and secured by applying a specified torque to the bolt head or nut with a torque wrench. A particular sub-category of this anchor is called wedge type. As shown in the figure, tightening the bolt results in a wedge being driven up against a sleeve, which expands it and causes it to compress against the material it is being fastened to. * displacement controlled: usually consist of an expansion sleeve and a conical expansion plug, whereby the sleeve is internally threaded to accept a threaded element.  Undercut anchors  The force-transfer mechanism is based on mechanical interlock. A special drilling operation allows to create a contact surface between the anchor head and the hole's wall where bearing stresses are exchanged.  Bonded anchors  The force-transfer mechanism is based on bond stresses provided by binding organic materials. Both Ribbed bars and threaded rods can be used and a change of the local bond mechanism can be appreciated experimentally. In ribbed bars the resistance is prevalently due to shear behavior of concrete between the ribs whereas for threaded rods friction prevails.(see also Anchorage in reinforced concrete). Bonded anchors are also referred as adhesive anchors or chemical anchors. The anchoring material is an adhesive (also called mortar) usually consisting of epoxy, polyester, or vinylester resins. The performance of this anchor's types in terms of 'load-bearing capacity', especially under tension loads, is strictly related to the cleaning condition of the hole. Experimental results showed that the reduction of the capacity is up to 60%. The same applies also for moisture condition of concrete, for wet concrete the reduction is of 20% using polyester resin. Other issues are represented by high temperature behavior and creep response..  Screw anchors  The force-transfer mechanism of the screw anchor is based on concentrated pressure exchange between the screw and concrete through the pitches.  Plastic anchors   Tapcon screws  Tapcon screws are a popular anchor that stands for self tapping (self threading) concrete screw. Larger diameter screws are referred to as LDT's. This type of fastener requires a pre-drilled hole‚Äîusing a Tapcon drillbit‚Äîand are then screwed into the hole using a standard hex or phillips bit. These screws are often blue, white, or stainless.All About Tapcon Screws; Do It Yourself website online; accessed April 2019 They are also available in versions for marine or high stress applications.  Plastic anchors  Their force-transfer mechanism is similar to mechanical expansion anchors. A torque moment is applied to a screw which is inserted in a plastic sleeve. As the torque is applied the plastic expands the sleeve against the sides of the hole acting as expansion force.  Powder-Actuated anchors  They act transferring the forces via mechanical interlock. This fastening technology is used in steel-to-steel connection, for instance to connect cold-formed profiles. A screw is inserted into the base material via a gas actuated gas gun. The driving energy is usually provided by firing a combustible propellant in powder form. The fastener's insertion provokes the plastic deformation of the base material which accommodates the fastener's head where the force transfer takes place. Mechanical Behavior  Modes of Failure in tension  Anchors can fail in different way when loaded in tension: * Steel failure: the weak part of the connection is represented by the rod. The failure corresponds to the tensile break-out of steel as in case of tensile testing. In this case, concrete base material might be undamaged. * Pull-out: the anchor is pulled out from the drilled hole partially damaging the surrounding concrete. When the concrete is damaged the failure is also indicated as pull-through. * Concrete cone: after reaching the load-bearing capacity a cone shape is formed. The failure is governed by crack growth in concrete. This kind of failure is typical in pull-out test. * Splitting failure: failure is characterized by a splitting crack which divides the base material into two parts. This kind of failure occurs when the dimensions of the concrete component are limited or the anchor is installed close to an edge. * Blow-out failure: failure is characterized by the lateral spalling of concrete in the proximity of the anchor's head. This kind of failure occurs for anchors (prevalently cast-in-place) installed near the edge of the concrete element. In design verification under ultimate limit state, codes prescribe to verify all the possible failure mechanisms.

This type of failure occurs, for an anchor in the proximity of the edge of the concrete member. * Pry-out: a semi-conical fracture surface develops characterize the failure. The pryout mechanism for cast-in anchors usually occurs with very short, stocky studs. The studs are typically so short and stiff that under a direct shear load, they bend causing contemporarily crushing in front of the stud and a crater of concrete behind. In design verification under ultimate limit state, codes prescribe to verify all the possible failure mechanisms. File:Concrete Edge failure.png|Concrete Edge failure File:Pry Out Failure.png|Pry-Out failure  Combined tension/shear  When contemporarily tension and shear load are applied to an anchor the failure occurs earlier (at a less load-bearing capacity) with respect the un-coupled case. In current design codes a linear interaction domain is assumed. Group of anchors Group of two bonded anchors with overlapping concrete cones In order to increase the load-carrying capacity anchors are assembled in group, moreover this allow also to arrange a bending moment resisting connection. For tension and shear load, the mechanical behavior is markedly influenced by (i) the spacing between the anchors and (ii) the possible difference in the applied forces. Service load behavior Under service loads (tension and shear) anchor's displacement must be limited. The anchor performance (load-carrying capacity and characteristic displacements) under different loading condition is assessed experimentally, then an official document is produced by technical assessment body. In design phase, the displacement occurring under the characteristic actions should be not larger than the admissible displacement reported in the technical document. Seismic load behavior Under seismic loads and there would be the possibility that an anchor is contemporarily (i) installed in a crack and (ii) subjected to inertia loads proportional both to the mass and the acceleration of the attached element (secondary structure) to the base material (primary structure). The load conditions in this case can be summarized as follow: * Pulsating Axial load: force aligned with the anchor's axis, positive in case of pullout condition and zero in case of pushing-in. * Reverse Shear load (also named ‚Äúalternate shear‚Äù): force perpendicular to the anchor's axis, positive and negative depending on an arbitrary sign convention. * Cyclic Crack (also named ‚Äúcrack movement‚Äù): RC primary structure undergoes in severe damage condition (i.e. cracking) and the most un-favorable case for anchor performance is when the crack plane contains the anchor's axis and the anchor is loaded by a positive axial force (constant during crack cycles). Exceptional loads behavior Exceptional loads differ from ordinary static loads for their rise time. High displacement rates are involved in impact loading. Regarding steel to concrete connections, some examples consist in collision of vehicle on barriers connected to concrete base and explosions. Apart from these extraordinary loads, structural connections are subjected to seismic actions, which rigorously have to be treated via dynamic approach. For instance, seismic pull-out action on anchor can have 0.03 seconds of rise time. On the contrary, in a quasi-static test, 100 second may be assumed as time interval to reach the peak load. Regarding the concrete base failure mode: Concrete cone failure loads increase with elevated loading rates with respect the static one.

John Benjamin Stone, portrait by Leslie Ward, 1902 Sir John Benjamin Stone (9 February 1838 ‚Äì 2 July 1914) was a British Conservative politician and photographer. Life and career Stone was born in Duddeston, Birmingham the son of a manager at a local glass works. The business passed into the hands of Stone, his father and a partner in 1860. It was later sold. By this time Stone had become a successful paper manufacturer. Stone was a local Conservative politician, founder of the Birmingham Conservative Association and MP for Birmingham East from 1895 to 1909. He was a member of the Sutton Coldfield Corporation for many years and was the first Mayor of the town in 1886 when the new Municipal Corporation was created; a post he held for four years. He was knighted in 1892 and was appointed High Steward of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield in 1902. He was also a prolific amateur documentary photographer who travelled widely in pursuit of his hobby. He made 26,000 photographs and wrote books as he travelled to Spain, Norway, Japan and Brazil. Amongst his published works were A Tour with Cook through Spain (1873), Children of Norway (1882), and a fairy tale called The Traveller's Joy. He also made an invaluable record of the folk customs and traditions of the British Isles, which influenced later photographers of note, including Homer Sykes, Daniel Meadows, Anna Fox and Tony Ray-Jones. Stone wrote of his purpose as being \\"to portray for the benefit of future generations the manners and customs, the festivals and pageants, the historic places and places of our times.\\"Quoted in Douglas B. Graham (production editor), Documentary Photography, Time-Life Books, 1974, p. 23 Stone travelled with a scientific expedition to northern Brazil to see the 1893 total solar eclipse. Notable images taken by Stone include those of the deposition of governor Jos√© Clarindo de Queir√≥s of the then province of Cear√° in Brazil, in which he prevented the rebels from firing at the governor's palace until he had taken photographs of them beside their guns. The Benjamin Stone Photographic Collection housed in the Library of Birmingham contains many thousands of examples of his work. In 1897 he founded the National Photographic Record Association, of which he became president. The National Portrait Gallery holds 62 of his portraits and many photographs of people and places in and around Westminster. His amateur career culminated in 1911 with his appointment as official photographer to the coronation of King George V. He became president of the Birmingham Photographic Society, a Justice of the Peace, and a member of the Society of Antiquaries and of the Geological Society. He was admitted as an honorary member of the Clothworkers' Company in February 1902. Stone died at his home, The Grange in Erdington, on 2 July 1914. His wife of nearly fifty years died on 5 July, just three days later. They were buried together in a double funeral in Sutton Coldfield on 7 July 1914. A rotund, bewhiskered man, Stone has been described by his biographer as quietly self-assured and contented in temperament.

Sarili ka Hintsa (about 1810 - 1892) was the 5th chief of the Gcaleka sub-group of the Xhosa nation, and paramount chief of all the Xhosa, from 1835 until his death in 1892 at Sholora, Bomvanaland. He was also known as \\"Kreli\\", and led the Gcaleka armies in a series of frontier wars. Early life and family Sarili was the oldest son of the great Hintsa ka Khawuta and Nomsa kaGambushe Tshezi. Sarili had nine wives including Nohuthe, Nondwe of the abaThembu and Bayo of the amaGwali. His first heir died in 1853 at the age of 12 and the next in line was his son Sigcawu ka Sarili from his second wife Nohuthe. His daughter Novili Nomkafulo became the great wife of Ngangelizwe Qeya, the 6th paramount chief of the abaThembu. Another daughter Nowisile became the wife of Chief Falo Mgudlwa of the amaJumba Thembu and the adoptive mother of the future Thembu national poet Mbombini Molteno Sihele. Another daughter became the wife of Mhlontlo of the Mpondomise and another became the wife of Chief Gwadiso of the Khonjwayo. Reign (1835-1892) A column of Sarili's gunmen, crossing a ravine in the frontier mountains, during the Eighth Frontier War. Throughout his reign, Sarili struggled against the expanding British Empire. He was a skilled diplomat who was respected and loved, even by those of the prominent whites of the Cape who knew him well. He typically sought to maintain Gcaleka independence by avoiding direct confrontation with the British. This strategy initially worked, but as a nationalist and paramount chief of all the Xhosa, he was later drawn into conflict with the British by the neighbouring Ngqika Xhosa. His Kingdom's indirect aid to the Ngqika during the Seventh and Eighth Frontier Wars (1846‚Äì1853) was discovered and led to a temporary white invasion of Gcalekaland. The Great Cattle Killing (1856-1858) and aftermath Sarili played an important part in the Great Cattle Killing, a millennialist movement which began among the Xhosa in 1856, and led them to destroy their own means of subsistence in the belief that it would bring about salvation by supernatural spirits, who would return and drive the white people into the sea. Genuinely believing the prophecies of Nongqawuse, Sarili destroyed his cattle and crops, causing thousands of his subjects to do likewise. The famine that followed devastated the last Xhosa Kingdom, forcing the Xhosa to turn to the neighbouring Cape Colony for food, blankets and other relief. His fostering of the cattle killing also led to him being hated in white opinion, as the supposed villain of the frontier conflicts. He was briefly exiled from Gcalekaland, to the territory on the far side of the Mbashe, only being allowed to return in 1865. In his absence, the Mfengu people (traditional enemies of the Gcaleka) settled in much of his former land. The Fengu- Gcaleka War (1877-1879) A local commando on the Cape-Gcalekaland frontier during the conflict, 1878. The Fengu (\\"Fingoes\\"), renowned sharpshooters and traditional enemies of the Gcaleka, were confronted by Sarili in the final frontier war. Subsequently, the policies of the Cape Colony and those of the British Empire differed, with regards to Sarili. The Cape achieved responsible government in 1872 and, with little further interest in annexing Xhosa land, signed treaties with both Sarili and his enemies such as the Thembu, recognising Gcalekaland's territorial integrity. The British on the other hand, sought to offer \\"protection\\" to increasing numbers of Transkeian chiefdoms, isolating Sarili diplomatically and constricting his power in the region. Both parties appear to have deliberately favoured Sarili's enemies in trade and other dealings with the Transkei territories, and when fighting broke out between Sarili and the neighbouring Thembu, the British intervened once again and brought yet another of his opponents under British \\"protection\\". From the mid-1870s, a series of severe droughts across the Transkei began to place growing strain on the relative peace which had prevailed for the previous few decades. The droughts had begun as early as 1875 in Sarhili's territory, and had spread to other parts of the Transkei and Basutoland, and even into the Cape Colony controlled Ciskei. Their severity increased up until 1877 and ethnic tensions began to break out, particularly between the Mfengu, the Thembu and the Gcaleka Xhosa. In 1877, fighting between Mfengu and Gcaleka tribesmen broke out at a festival, rapidly escalating into a shoot-out and finally into a full-blown inter-tribal war that spread along the frontier. Sarili sought to avoid any further escalation of this conflict, as he fully understood that the Mfengu, as allies of the Cape Colony, would draw in both the Cape and the British Imperial forces. However he was nonetheless forced into involvement by several of his councillors and chiefs. Decades of provocation from his enemies, overpopulation, and pressure from his councillors drove Sarili into a corner, and he mobilised his armies. Initially the situation seemed unlikely to escalate further, as the Cape Colony government insisted on only deploying its local mounted commandos to police the frontier, but the involvement of the British Empire, via Sir Bartle Frere, desiring to finally annex Gcalekaland for his planned British Confederation, sealed the fate of the last independent Xhosa kingdom. Sarili tried to unite the Xhosa tribes into a unified force for resistance, but after two devastating pitched battles, he declared an end to the struggle and went into exile, first in Pondoland and afterwards to Bomvanaland. He died in exile in 1892, at Sholora, Bomvanaland.

Taking place on the island of Biak, in Geelvink Bay, in present-day Indonesia, it was part of General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Command's offensive drive to clear New Guinea in preparation for an invasion of the Philippines. It was the first major effort by the Japanese to allow uncontested landings for the purpose of creating a kill zone inland. The main Allied objective was to capture the island so that they could construct airfields there. The battle resulted in the capture of the island by Allied forces, which were then used to support operations elsewhere in the Pacific. Background The island of Biak forms part of the Schouten Islands, and dominates the entrance to Geelvink Bay, near the western end of New Guinea; its terrain and location about from Hollandia and from Sarmi (where the Japanese had begun concentrating supply bases and airfields), made it well suited to airfield construction, particularly in the flatter southeastern area. As a result, as the Allies began their advance towards the Philippines in 1944, General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific command began planning its capture.Smith 1996, p. 206 In conceptualizing the operation, Allied planners envisaged a week-long operation; estimating that there were up to 2,000 Japanese troops defending the area.Morison 2001, p. 107 Four landing beaches were chosen near Bosnek, designated Green 1, 2, 3 and 4. Allied planners considered these beaches to be poorer for landing operations, compared to those further away from the airfields, but they were chosen due to their proximity to the main Allied objectives and because aerial reconnaissance indicated that the beaches were not backed by cliffs or swamps, and that there were two jetties nearby that might facilitate deep-water port access.Smith 1996, pp. 282‚Äì285 A map showing the location of Biak in the Schouten Islands The assault force consisted of five destroyer transports (APD), eight LSTs eight LCTs, and fifteen LCIs, supported by a myriad of smaller vessels including DUKWs, LCVPs and LVTs, which were chosen due to concerns about the coral reef opposite the landing beaches.Morison 2001, pp. 105‚Äì106 These were protected by two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and twenty-one destroyers;Smith 1996, pp. 284‚Äì286 several Australian vessels including the cruisers HMAS Australia and Shropshire and the destroyer Warramunga were included in this task force.Cassells 2000, p. 121Gill 1968, p. 422 The naval forces, designated Task Force 77.2, were commanded by Rear Admiral William Morrow Fechteler. Close air support for the Allied operation was provided by Lieutenant General George C. Kenney's Fifth Air Force, operating from Hollandia and Wakde Island, although elements of the Thirteenth Air Force, as well as Australian and Dutch squadrons operating from as far away as Darwin, also provided strategic air support.Smith 1996, p. 284 Allied intelligence greatly under-estimated the number of troops holding the island. The island was held by 11,400 Japanese troops under the command of Colonel Kuzume Naoyuki. Initially, the majority of the combat troops (about 4,000 personnel), were drawn from the veteran 222nd Infantry Regiment which had previously served in China, along with tanks from the IJA 36th Division, supported by artillery, anti-aircraft, construction and naval guard and base troops under Rear Admiral Sadatoshi Senda.Smith 1996, p. 300. These troops were reinforced by elements of the 35th Division's 219th and 221st Infantry Regiments.Smith 1996, pp. 355 & 359 Due to the size of the coastline he had to defend, and based on an appreciation of the Allied objectives, Kuzume focused his defensive plans away from the water's edge. Instead, he decided to carry out a feint, allowing the Americans to come ashore unopposed so that they would advance into the trap he had prepared for them utilizing a series of caves that were located west of Mokmer and to the east of Bosnek. This defensive complex was intended to turn the area around the vital airfield into a honeycomb of defended caves and pillboxes filled with riflemen, automatic weapons, artillery, batteries of mortars, and a single company of Type 95 Ha- Go light tanks. The western caves were connected by a series of underground tunnels and were largely constructed for fighting purposes. Kuzume also stockpiled these positions with ammunition and other supplies, with several dumps located around the eastern cave area, along with living quarters for the defenders.Smith 1996, pp. 300‚Äì301 Water was limited on Biak and had to be strictly rationed by the US troops, and heat and humidity would take a heavy toll during the fighting.US 41st Infantry Division 1944, p. 3 The Allies knew from an intercepted message dated 5 May 1944 that the IJA 2nd Area intelligence thought the next Allied landing would probably be on Biak, and a preliminary landing was made on 17 May at Wakde on the way to Biak. There a smaller airfield was available, which could be used as an advanced base until the Biak strips were ready. While initial Allied G2 estimates of Japanese troops was approximately 5,000, an intercepted message at the end of April gave the ration strength as 10,800, though it was thought this was a figure based upon projected, rather than, current strength.Bleakley 1991, p. 150 Battle The invasion force assembled largely in the Humboldt Bay area near Hollandia, and after only limited rehearsals departed late on 25 May.Smith 1996, pp. 289‚Äì290 After a 45-minute pre-landing naval bombardment,Smith 1996, p. 287 the 41st Infantry Division of the United States Army landed on Biak on 27 May 1944, initially with the 162nd Infantry Regiment, and soon followed by the remainder of the division, including the 163rd and 186th Infantry Regiments. By 5:15 in the afternoon 12,000 troops had landed, with 12 M4 Sherman tanks, 29 field guns, 500 vehicles, and 3,000 tons of supplies, including 600 tons aboard vehicles.Smith 1996, pp. 287‚Äì298 Several minor Japanese air attacks took place against the US lodgment on the first day; initially these were not pressed too heavily, but in the afternoon two waves of aircraft attacked the LSTs around the western jetty. Several bombs were dropped, but failed to explode. Three aircraft were destroyed and one was badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire from the US ships and guns that had been brought ashore.Morison 2001, p. 113 Map depicting the US landings and seizure of Mokmer Drome After a brief attack on the beachhead by a group of Japanese light tanks, which was defeated by a group of M4 Shermans in the first tank against tank engagement of the Pacific War,Smith 1996, p. 310 the US regiment moved inland quietly confident and expecting little opposition. This perception changed completely when they reached the airfield. From low-lying terrain and surrounding ridges came a storm of heavy weapons fire that pinned the US troops down. It was not until dark that amphibious tractors could be brought up to extricate them from the trap. The next day they reached the end of Mokmer airstrip. (Sorido airstrip was the objective.) The Japanese held firm, delaying its capture.Bleakley 1991, p. 153 With the slow progress the US command pulled their forces back, relieved Major General Horace Fuller of command of the 41st Division and reinforced the division with the 34th Regimental Combat Team (34th RCT) of the 24th Infantry Division.Smith 1996, p. 343 On 5 June the 186th Infantry, with the 2nd Battalion of the 162nd Infantry attached, moved to the eastern bases of the ridges dominating Mokmer strip. A coordinated attack was launched on 7 June which resulted in the capture of Mokmer strip and the establishment of a beachhead south of the strip; however, Japanese resistance continued in the area, particularly in the caves overlooking the area, and prevented engineers from improving the airfield. The engineers recommenced their efforts on 13 June but were once again disrupted by the Japanese.Morison 2001, p. 132 General Robert L. Eichelberger assumed command of the Hurricane Task Force on 15 June, tasked with renewing the attack. The new attack plan was to drive the Japanese from all terrain upon which they could fire on Mokmer Drome. First the West Caves, the Japanese encampment area, was cleared by the 186th Infantry Regiment, who then moved up on the ridges. The 34th RCT, supported by the 167th Field Artillery Battalion, occupied Borokoe and Sorido Dromes almost without opposition.Smith 1996, pp. 369‚Äì380 The US forces had been delayed 10 days. With the delay, the Fifth Air Force Command looked for alternative sites from which they could operate. They arranged the capture of the nearby island of Owi on 2 June and built Owi Airfield comprising two 7,000-ft airstrips there. An advanced echelon was stationed there composed of a bombardment group, two fighter groups, a P-61 Black Widow night fighter group, and a garrison of 15,000 troops.Bleakley 1991, p. 155 The assault on Biak, infantrymen moving up, May 1944 Control of Biak nearly became a critical turning point battle in the campaign for the Pacific. The Japanese had been seeking to engage the Americans in a decisive battle, the Kantai Kessen, that would enable them to win the war. Biak was not far from major Japanese fleet units and there were a number of land airfields nearby that could support the land-based aircraft the Japanese were hoping to concentrate to defeat the US fleet. The Imperial Navy's Chief of Staff, Admiral Ry≈´nosuke Kusaka, believed Biak represented the Allies' main effort, and a counterattack at Biak could provoke the US Navy into engaging in a major action.Willmott 1984, p. 186 In response to the landing at Biak by US forces, the Japanese launched an operation to reinforce the area. Initially, for air support, the Japanese 23rd Air Flotilla initially only had 18 aircraft but was later reinforced with up to 166 aircraft, which were moved to Sorong, in Dutch New Guinea, arriving from Japan and the Marianas.Vego 2016, p. 227 The Imperial Japanese Navy also began planning to reinforce the island under Operation KON. Planning for this operation began on 29 May. A total of 2,500 troops from the 2nd Amphibious Brigade were assigned for transport from Mindanao; they were to be escorted by a force under Rear Admiral Naomasa Sakonju, consisting of the battleship Fuso, the heavy cruisers Aoba, Myoko and Haguro, the light cruiser Kinu, and eight destroyers (five as part of the screen and three as part of the transport element). They were scheduled to reach Biak on 3 June; other forces were to be transported from Manokwari by barge.Morison 2001, p. 118 Admiral Teijir≈ç Toyoda, commander of the Japanese Mobile Fleet, initially attempted to reinforce Biak to hold the airstrips, but his first reinforcement sent 1 June was turned back when a Japanese scout plane mistakenly reported a US aircraft carrier in the vicinity. A second relief effort on 8 June was intercepted and driven off by American and Australian naval forces. A third attempt, with the support of the super- battleships and , was scheduled for 13 June, but the American invasion of the Marianas forced the Imperial Navy to redirect their forces to the Marianas for a major confrontation in the Philippine Sea.Bleakley 1991, p. 154 US infantry on Biak These efforts were coupled with heavy air attacks. On 2 June, a heavy Japanese air attack was undertaken against LSTs around Biak in support of the reinforcement efforts; a total of 12 out of 54 attacking aircraft were lost, while one Allied LST suffered a near miss.Morison 2001, p. 119 The following day, another large scale air attack was undertaken by Japanese aircraft against Allied vessels around Biak, resulting in minor damage and the loss of 11 aircraft out of 41.Vego 2016, p. 229 In total, three reinforcement efforts were undertaken as part of Operation KON, as well as further barge operations; several large vessels and a number of aircraft were lost by the Japanese during these efforts, although about 1,200 personnel from the 219th, 221st and 222nd Infantry Regiments were landed throughout June.Smith 1996, pp. 350‚Äì361 No. 1 Wireless Unit RAAF, an Australian radio transmission intercept and monitoring unit, learned that, at the time of the invasion, Lieutenant General Takuzo Numata, the Chief of Staff of the 2nd Area Army, was on the island for an inspection tour. He sent messages to command requesting to be evacuated. A float plane was sent in from Korim Bay on the night of 20 June to bring him off. After two more days of intense fighting, Kuzume burned the regimental colors, indicating to his men that the regiment would make the defense of Biak their final battle. He then committed hara kiri, showing his men he did not fear death.Bleakley 1991, pp. 153‚Äì154 Allied engineers resumed their work on Mokmer airfield on 20 June.Morison 2001, p. 133 The Americans broke through the Japanese defenses on 22 June, with the coastal strip from Bosnek to Sorido being captured, including the three airfields at Sorido (4500 ft), Borokoe (4500 ft) and Mokmer (8,000 ft). There were about 3,000 Japanese remnants trying to organize a final counterattack up to 17 August.Bleakley 1991, pp. 149‚Äì159 Aftermath The capture of Biak Island cost the Allied ground forces 438 killed and 2,361 wounded or injured in action, while casualties amongst naval forces amounted to 22 killed, 14 missing and 68 wounded. In addition, US forces suffered 7,234 non battle casualties. The majority of these non battle casualties were caused by scrub typhus. About 600 British Indian and Javanese forced laborers were released from Japanese custody after the battle.Smith 1996, pp. 392‚Äì393 From their good service on Biak and other Pacific islands, the 41st received another nickname: the Jungleers. The Japanese fought to annihilation, with 4,700 killed and 200 captured; the remainder faced death from disease and starvation in the following months. Biak was a grinding, shot-for-shot battle. The Japanese tactics of allowing the landing and delaying their firing until there were a great many targets were repeated at other battles including the Battle of Peleliu and the Battle of Okinawa. A disabled Japanese tank at Biak The Allies subsequently developed Biak into a logistics base and constructed several airfields in the area. Several runways were constructed by US engineers on nearby Owi, while Mokmer Drome was operational by 22 June, and was further improved and expanded with hardstandings for over 100 aircraft throughout July and into August. Other fields were constructed at Borokoe and Sorido, although the latter field was not completed due to limited manpower and unsuitable terrain. These fields were not completed in time for use during operations to capture the Marianas in June, but they were utilized during follow on actions against the Palau Islands in September; Biak was also used to strike targets in Mindanao and in the Netherlands East Indies. The port facilities around Biak were also improved, with eight berths constructed for LSTs along the southern coast, while two floating docks were constructed to facilitate use by Liberty Ships at Biak and Owi. Several other docks and jetties were constructed or improved, while several roads ‚Äì on Owi and on Biak ‚Äì were constructed around the island to improve internal lines of communication; another of existing roads on Biak were also improved. A 400-bed hospital was also constructed, while another was planned but ultimately not completed.Smith 1996, pp. 393‚Äì394 Notes References     Further reading * Category:South West Pacific theatre of World War II Category:Conflicts in 1944 Battle of Biak Battle of Biak Battle of Biak Category:Battles of World War II involving the United States Category:Battles of World War II involving Australia Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan Category:May 1944 events Category:June 1944 events Category:July 1944 events Category:August 1944 events ","title":"Battle of Biak"},{"id":"7163671","text":"Tim Rutili (born Temistocles Hugo Rutili) American musician, filmmaker, and visual artist.

Established in 1917 as part of the Logan City School District, its campus is in the southwest part of the city. Logan High is currently in the Utah High School Activities Association (UHSAA) Class 4A Region XII and its mascot is a Grizzly. History The city school board voted to establish a high school in 1917, having previously only offered an education through the 8th grade. High school was previously conducted at Brigham Young College in Logan. A building to house the new high school was completed in 1919, on the corner of Church and Federal Avenues in Logan. The first senior class graduated in 1921. In 1926 the school relocated to the campus of recently closed Brigham Young College, on 200 S between 100 and 300 W. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake on 30 August 1962 caused significant damage to the old college buildings. In 1968 a new athletic field complex was completed, and named after the late Glen \\"Zeus\\" Worthington, the school's athletic director and USUhttp://publish.netitor.com/photos/schools/ust/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/university-2001.pdf and state of Utah Athletic Hall of Fame inductee. A physical education complex was added in 1978. In 1984 the school expanded to include a freshman class. With the increasing number of students, the Woodruff Elementary school was closed and converted to the English department and writing lab; a new Woodruff was constructed at 650 S 1000 W. The old boys' gym was demolished in the summer of 1999 and a new gymnasium, lobby, and storage area was built in its place, opening during the 2000‚Äì2001 school year. During the 2003‚Äì2004 school year several athletic fields were renovated or built, including a new turf football field, softball diamond, and sand volleyball courts. These were followed by a new state-of-the-art baseball diamond, constructed during the 2006‚Äì2007 school year. In 2007 a large addition was built for the school, which included a media center, larger cafeteria, and new classrooms as well as remodeling along the south and west sides of the building. In 2015 the athletics facilities, including the baseball and softball diamonds, football field, and basketball arena underwent renovation under new athletic director Mike Hansen. Work began on a complete remodel of the entire high school in 2015, to be completed in 2018.  Art programs  The school offers several co-curricular activities in the arts, including orchestra, band, and choir programs, as well as visual arts, ceramics, and photography programs. LHS offers a drama program and theater arts classes along with an extracurricular drama club. The school puts on a musical (with pit orchestra) and a play each year, as well as a Concerto Night in which audition-selected students perform an instrumental concerto with the full Philharmonic Orchestra.  Orchestra  The LHS Orchestra program consists of three string orchestras with a total of about 150 students. The orchestras are divided by grade level; the Concert Orchestra is made up of freshmen, the Sinfonia Orchestra consists of sophomores, and the Philharmonic Orchestra consists of juniors and seniors. Logan High orchestras regularly qualify for state-level competition.  Band  LHS has two bands, the lower or symphonic band and the upper or wind band, as well as two extracurricular jazz bands. Unlike the orchestra, the bands are not split up by grade but by skill. The Wind Band and Jazz Band go on national trips every other year, visiting cities such as Boston, Chicago, New York, San Diego, and Washington, D.C. They also regularly participate in state and regional festivals and competitions. Extra-curricular activities Logan High School offers over 25 student clubs and 17 varsity athletic teams. Notable student organizations include the debate team, which won the Utah class 3A state title during the 2007‚Äì2008 school year and took second in the 2009‚Äì2010 4A State Tournament; the football team, which won state titles in 1978, 1988, 1989, 2000, 2005, 2007, 2011, and 2015; the swimming team, which claimed the state title in 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005, 2006, 2009, the boys' tennis team, which won state in 2009; the lacrosse team, which claimed state titles in 2006 and 2015; and the ice hockey team, which won the state championship in 2009.

History Hill School opened in 1926 with five students in an upstairs room in what was then the Middleburg Bank, at 1 East Washington Street. In 1928, the school moved to a half acre of land at its current location. Over the next sixty-three years (1928-1991) the school's enrollment and campus steadily grew. In 1991, the enrollment was 178 and the 4.5 acre campus consisted of five buildings, one playing field, and a faculty house. In 1991 and 1992, Mr. Stephen C. Clark Jr. and his daughter, Hill alumna Jane Forbes Clark, gave the school 133 acres, three houses, and a barn. Today, Hill School serves students in Junior Kindergarten through 8th grade. Campus The campus was expanded by 133 acres in 1991 and 1992 through the gifts of land from Stephen C. Clark Jr. and his daughter, Hill alumna Jane Forbes Clark. As a result, the Board of Trustees and school leadership were able to develop a comprehensive master plan which was completed between 1993-2003. Most of the daily school life occurs in the northeast quadrant of the campus. The academic and co-curricular facilities are separated by small courtyards and are connected by a central brick walkway. Traffic circles and parking areas are located on the perimeter so there are no cars in the central campus. The athletic fields, the amphitheater, the walking and running trails, the arboretum, the science center, ponds and wetlands are to the south and west of the buildings and encompass most of the land. Five of the fifteen school-owned faculty houses are on or contiguous to the campus. Place-Based Education Program In addition to the JK-8 science curriculum emphasizing hands-on learning, Hill School incorporates place-based outdoor field studies ‚Äì the Dornin Science Center units. This unique program gives children the opportunity to use scientific field methodology to monitor, interact with, and connect to their environment, which fosters responsible stewardship. Field studies include forest surveys, water quality monitoring using chemical tests and invertebrate surveys, soil testing and soil amendment, growing food, bluebird box construction and observation, colonial gardening, and many other outdoor activities. Most of these programs take place on our beautiful 137 acre campus, which includes a variety of habitats and open spaces. Co-Curricular Program Hill School refers to Art, Music, Drama, and Athletics as co- curricular to emphasize they are part of parcel of every student's Hill School experience. Hill believes that every child should have meaningful participation and engagement with these programs.

This allowed Prussia to consolidate its Rhenish territories held since 1803, such as the Electorate of Trier, County of Manderscheid, Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy, the previously Free Imperial City of Aachen, parts of Luxembourg and Limburg, as well as a few other small territories.

About 250 traditional sailing ships of all types and sizes from a vast variety of countries visit the coast of the city of Rostock every year during the second weekend of August. Today, the Hanse Sail forms part of the joint Baltic Sail, which takes place in several countries bordering the Baltic Sea during July and August.  History  The first Hanse Sail took place between 22‚Äì28 July 1991. Despite initial skepticism, the first Hanse Sail turned out to be a great success. This might have been mainly due to enthusiasm sparked by the German reunification, as the sea border was open for the first time in decades. Main attractions in past years were German Navy's training ship Gorch Fock, the Alexander von Humboldt (ship) and the Peace from Jamaica. Every Hanse Sail is usually opened by prominent personalities of the time such as Gerhard Schr√∂der or Wolfgang Thierse. This underlines the importance of the event, also for the local tourism industry. Overview Every year about 1 million visitors visit the Hanse Sail. Even though it is accompanied by other cultural events, the ships remain the center of the festival. Besides watching ships, it is also possible to sail on them or enter them while they are anchored. Many cruise ships head for the cruise port at Warnem√ºnde during this time, because the shipping companies think that staying in Rostock during the Hanse Sail is a special highlight for their guests. There are also sea planes and a helicopter parallel to the festival. They offer the opportunity to fly with them for about 20 minutes. On the Saturday of the event there are fireworks in Warnem√ºnde and the city harbour. The 2015 Hanse Sail featured steam ships also, and the event occurred in August 2015. This was the 25th Hanse Sail since the start. (Hanse Sail Rostock 2015) It was predicted something like 250 sailing ships would attend Hanse Sail in 2015. Dates of Hanse Sails * 2015: 6 August - 9 August * 2014: 6 August - 10 August * 2013: 8 August - 11 August * 2012: 9 August - 12 August * 2011: 11 August - 14 August Panorama Public transport Expanded train service between Rostock and Warnem√ºnde Public transport is significantly increased during the event. Every 7.5 minutes, the S-Bahn plies between Rostock Hauptbahnhof (main station) and Warnem√ºnde with up to five bilevel cars. Also many chartered trains come to Rostock, some even steam powered, and Deutsche Bahn operates extra trains. The tram and bus services in Rostock operate a special timetable and on some nights go 24 hours non stop. Due to limited parking lot capacity, a shuttle service with buses is offered to bring people to Warnem√ºnde. Funding Sponsors have included Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock (German brewery), Ostdeutscher Sparkassenverbund, and OstseeSparkasse Rostock. Further sources of revenue are letting of boat parking spaces and trading places on markets as well as commercial advertising. The City of Rostock supports the Hanse Sail financially, because the city largely profits from the event. During the sail, most hotels are usually fully booked and visitors spend money in the town, in pubs and shops. Last, but not least, the sail is good promotion for Rostock and a good percentage of Hanse Sail visitors usually return for a holiday. Gallery File:Impressionen von der 22.

Reminiscences of a Volunteer\\" from which the following information and quotations are taken.A Documentary History of the Jews of the United States, 1654-1875, third edition, edited by Morris U. Schappes, Schocken Books, 1971, pages 263-273. Hirschhorn immigrated to the United States at age of 16, leaving his sister and widowed mother behind. He frequented a cafe on Broadway in New York where \\"the best class of French and German\\" drank cognac. There he met a French Count who recruited him to his Company B, 1st Regiment, New York Volunteers, as his prot√©g√©. The Count, who was Captain of the company, arranged for this although Jacob‚Äîwhom he repeatedly called \\"Bon Gar√ßon\\"‚Äîwas under age. They soon set sail and trained on an Island 200 miles from Vera Cruz, embarked again and joined a fleet of U.S. warships in Veracruz, Veracruz. They disembarked and attacked Vera Cruz from the south, amid American bombardment: \\"So awful a sight, but still grand, I have never seen, especially at night...fired from huge mortars on the frigates and line ships.\\" The city surrendered after two days and the Stars and Stripes replaced the Mexican flag. After some days camped under trying conditions they moved inland and faced Santa Anna's 20,000 troops entrenched on fortified heights. They scaled these and the assault succeeded--\\"the Mexicans fled 'vamoosed' as they call it\\"‚Äîbut only after many American casualties. Hirschorn describes other difficult battles. Because he could converse in German, French, and English, young as he was he was put in charge of a quartermaster's wagon train to obtain provisions for the Regiment, which was not being resupplied from the U.S. They then mounted an assault on Mexico City. The initial attack on Chapultepec Castle was mounted by a unit called \\"Forlorn Hope\\" because none was expected to return. \\"We advanced two hundred strong.

Plot introduction A dark, even bleak, novel, Let It Come Down follows American Nelson Dyar as he arrives in the International Zone of Tangier, Morocco to begin a new job and a new life. Dyar's exploration of the brothels, drugs and unsavoury characters of Tangier leads him gradually, logically, to a sinister conclusion. Explanation of the novel's title Bowles took the book's title from Macbeth III.3, just before Banquo is murdered: :Banquo: It will be rain to-night. :1st. Murd.: Let it come down. :(They set upon Banquo.) The author has described the line as an ‚Äòadmirable four-word sentence, succinct and brutal‚Äô. Major themes Like much of Bowles's writing, Let It Come Down seems to be concerned with the danger and chaos which can result in being immersed into an unfamiliar society. By the time the book was published, Tangier had become a fully Moroccan city, but before that, and in the setting of the novel, it was an International Zone which is seen as a melting-pot for many diverse and unconventional elements. Dyar, who has little personality of his own, tries to indulge his instincts by exploring the seedier side of the city; but, because he does not fully understand the limits or standards of the society he is in, he is unable to stop himself from going too far. Thus, Dyar allows situations to, in fact, react off of himself in his attempt to live by utopian free choice. However, he must eventually start taking responsibility for his own actions when consequences are set naturally upon him. Behind the useful fa√ßade of a civilised society, Bowles's book suggests, there is only the stark futility of cause, and inescapable effect.

It was pioneered and developed by the Royal Navy during the 18th century. In antiquity, ancient Greeks used lead plates to protect the under-water hull. Development Deterioration of the hull of a wooden ship was a significant problem during the Age of Sail. Ships' hulls were under continuous attack by shipworm, barnacles and various marine weeds, all of which had some adverse effect on the ship, be it structurally, in the case of the worm, or affecting speed and handling in the case of the weeds. The most common methods of dealing with these problems were through the use of wood, and sometimes lead, sheathing. Expendable wood sheathing effectively provided a non-structural skin to the hull for the worm to attack, and could be easily replaced in dry dock at regular intervals. However, weed grew rapidly and slowed ships. Lead sheathing, while more effective than wood in mitigating these problems, reacted badly with the iron bolts of the ships.McKee, A. in Bass (ed.) 1972, p.235 Even older than the sheathing methods were the various graving and paying techniques. There were three main substances used: White stuff, which was a mixture of whale oil, rosin and brimstone; Black stuff, a mixture of tar and pitch; and Brown stuff, which was simply brimstone added to Black stuff. It was common practice to coat the hull with the selected substance, then cover that with a thin outer layer of wooden planking.Gardiner (ed.) 2004, p. 142 The use of copper sheathing was first suggested by Charles Perry in 1708, though it was rejected by the Navy Board on grounds of high cost and perceived maintenance difficulties. The first experiments with copper sheathing were made in the late 1750s: the bottoms and sides of several ships' keels and false keels were sheathed with copper plates. In 1761, the experiment was expanded, and the 32-gun frigate was ordered to have her entire bottom coppered, in response to the terrible condition in which she had returned from service in the West Indies. HMS Alarm was chosen because, in 1761, a letter had been sent regarding the ship's condition, saying that the worms from the waters had taken a significant toll on the ship‚Äôs wooden hull. Before the copper plates were applied, the hull was covered with Soft stuff, which was simply hair, yarn and brown paper. The copper performed very well, both in protecting the hull from worm invasion and in preventing weed growth for, when in contact with water, the copper produced a poisonous film, composed mainly of copper oxychloride, that deterred these marine organisms. Furthermore, as this film was slightly soluble, it gradually washed away, leaving no way in which marine life could attach itself to the ship. However, it was soon discovered by the Admiralty that the copper bolts used to hold the plates to the hull had reacted with the iron bolts used in the construction of the ship, rendering many bolts nearly useless. In 1766, because of the poor condition of the iron bolts, Alarm's copper was removed. After this experiment, and deterred by the unanticipated and not understood electrolytic reaction between the copper and iron, lead sheathing was tried again, though it was found to be unsuitable to the task, as the plates tended to fall from the hull alarmingly quickly. By 1764, a second vessel, , had been sheathed in copper, specifically to prepare it for a voyage of discovery in tropical waters.Beaglehole 1966, p.195 Dolphins hull was inspected in 1768 after the ship had twice circumnavigated the world; there was significant corrosion of the hull's iron components, which had to be replaced. In 1769 another attempt was made at coppering a ship's hull, this time on a new ship that had been constructed using bolts made from a copper alloy. The results were far more favourable this time, but still the problems with the bolting remained. The onset and intensification from 1773 of the war with America took the focus off the bolting issue necessary to allow a full-scale coppering programme. By the 1780s the technology had spread to India. The ruler of Mysore, Tipu Sultan ordered that all his navy vessels have copper sheathing after observing the benefits in French and East India Company ships. Widespread implementation The remains of an early-19th century wooden ship, discovered in 2012 at a depth of in the Gulf of Mexico by the NOAAS Okeanos Explorer. Most of the timber has disintegrated, leaving behind the copper sheathing which has preserved the form of the hull With the American war in full swing, the Royal Navy set about coppering the bottoms of the entire fleet in 1778. This would not have happened but for war. This also came about because in 1778 a Mr. Fisher, a Liverpool shipbuilder (who did a brisk trade with West Africa) sent a letter to the Navy Board. In it he recommended \\"copper sheathing\\" as a solution to the problems of ship worm in warm tropical waters, and the effect on speed of tendrils of seaweed latching onto hulls. The letter itself does not survive and is obliquely referred to in other official correspondence held by the National Maritime Museum; it may have contained or been coincidental with a critical new technical breakthrough of protecting the iron bolting by applying thick paper between the copper plates and the hull. This had recently been trialled successfully (probably) on . This breakthrough was to be what would win over the Admiralty. Fisher's letter was seen by the new Navy Board Controller Charles Middleton, who had the major problem at the time with supplying over 100 ships for the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783), which was compounded that same year (1778) by French opportunism in declaring war on Britain to support the American rebels. This effectively turned what was a local civil war into a global conflict. Spain followed in 1779 and the Netherlands in 1780, and so Britain had to face its three greatest rivals. Middleton took the view that Britain was \\"outnumbered at every station\\", and the Navy was required to \\"extricate us from present danger\\". He understood that coppering allowed the navy to stay at sea for much longer without the need for cleaning and repairs to the underwater hull, making it a very attractive, if expensive, proposition. He had to expand the Navy but there was no time to add to the fleet, and limited resources available. It could take five years and 2000 trees to build a warship. However he could refurbish the existing fleet, he grasped Fisher's solution and on 21 January 1779 wrote to the Admiralty. He also petitioned King George III directly on this \\"matter of the gravest importance\\" for the necessary funding. He took with him a model of showing a coppered bottom to illustrate the method. The King backed him for what was an expensive process for an untested technology. Each ship on average required 15 tonnes of copper applied on average as 300 plates. All the copper was supplied by British mines (the only country in the world at that time that could do so), the largest mine being Parys Mountain in Anglesey, north Wales. The Parys mine had recently begun large-scale production and had glutted the British market with cheap copper; however, the 14 tons of metal required to copper a 74-gun third- rate ship of the line still cost ¬£1,500,Roger (2004), p.375 compared to ¬£262 for wood. The benefits of increased speed and time at sea were deemed to justify the costs involved. Middleton in May 1779 placed orders at the Portsmouth Docks for coppering all ships up to and including 32 guns when next they entered dry dock. In July, this order was expanded to include ships of 44 guns and fewer, in total 51 ships within a year. It was then decided that the entire fleet should be coppered, due to the difficulties in maintaining a mixed fleet of coppered and non-coppered ships. By 1781, 82 ships of the line had been coppered, along with fourteen 50-gun ships, 115 frigates, and 182 unrated vessels. All this was too late to avert the loss of the American colonies, however; meanwhile the French were threatening the lucrative sugar trade in the Caribbean, reckoned at the time as being of more importance to British interests than the 13 colonies. The sugar trade was paying for the costs of the American Revolutionary War and the Anglo-French War (1778‚Äì1783). The Royal Navy's newly coppered ships, as yet untested, were used successfully by Rodney in defeating the French at the Battle of the Saintes off Dominica in 1782. By the time the war ended in 1783, problems with the hull bolting were once more becoming apparent. Finally, a suitable alloy for the hull bolts was found, that of copper and zinc. At great cost, the Admiralty decided in 1786 to go ahead with the re-bolting of every ship in the navy, thus finally eliminating the bolt corrosion problem. This process lasted several years, after which no significant changes to the coppering system were required and metal plating remained a standard method of protecting a ship's underwater hull until the advent of modern anti-fouling paint. In the 19th century, pure copper was partially superseded by Muntz metal, an alloy of 60% copper, 40% zinc and a trace of iron. Muntz metal had the advantage of being somewhat cheaper than copper. Civilian use With its widespread adoption by the Royal Navy, some shipping owners employed the method on their merchant vessels. A single coppered vessel was recorded on the register of Lloyd's of London in 1777, a slaver sloop Hawke, 140 tons. This particular vessel impressed the Admiralty when it was inspected by Sandwich in 1775 at Sheerness after a 5-year voyage to India. By 1786, 275 vessels (around 3% of the merchant fleet) were coppered. By 1816, this had risen to 18% of British merchant ships. Copper sheets were exported to India for use on ships built there. In the late 18th and early 19th century, around 30% of Indian ships were coppered.McCarthy, p.109 Merchant ship owners were attracted by the savings made possible by copper sheathing, despite the initial outlay. As the coppering was expensive, only the better owners tended to invest in the method, and as a result the use of copper sheathing tended to indicate a well- found and maintained ship, which led to Lloyd's of London charging lower insurance premiums, as the vessels were better risks. From this stems the phrase \\"copper-bottomed\\" as an indication of quality, Coppering was more commonly used on merchant ships sailing in warm waters. Ships sailing in colder, northern waters often continued to use replaceable, wooden sheathing planks. Wood-boring organisms were less of a problem for these vessels and they were often routinely careened ‚Äì an operation that could cause considerable damage to expensive coppering. Coppering was widely used on slave ships.McCarthy, p.108 After the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act became British law in 1807, the slave trade became illegal so slavers valued fast ships that were more likely to evade patrolling Royal Navy vessels intent on capturing them.  Humphry Davy's experiments with copper sheathing  In the late 18th to early 19th century, Sir Humphry Davy performed many experiments to determine how to lessen the corrosion that the seawater caused on unprotected copper sheathing. To this end he had various thicknesses of copper submerged on the shore and then measured how much the sea water had degraded each one. Sheets of different metals remained in the seawater for four months and then were examined. Two harbour ships were also used in this test, one with an additional zinc band, the other with an iron one. Davy observed, that while the zinc and iron themselves became covered in carbonate that allowed weeds, plant life and insects to attach themselves to the metal, the copper sheets that were connected to cast iron or zinc parts were free of any attached life forms or discoloration. Unprotected copper would quickly go from a reddish color to a greenish color of corrosion. When the other metals were mixed with copper in ratios from 1:40 to 1:150, there was no visible sign of corrosion and minimal weight loss. When the ratio was changed to 1:200 and 1:400, there was significant corrosion and weight loss. Davy therefore advocated cast iron for protecting copper, since it was the cheapest to manufacture, and in his observations malleable iron and zinc seemed to wear down faster. Other uses The term copper-bottomed continues to be used to describe a venture, plan or investment that is safe and is certain to be successful. The related copper-fastened (and verb form copperfasten) is used similarly, though with the nuance of \\"secured, unambiguous\\", rather than \\"trustworthy, reliable\\".

The squadron was established as Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42) on 1 September 1950, redesignated as VA-42 on 1 November 1953 and disestablished on 30 September 1994. History \\"Green Pawn\\" nickname The insignia for VA-42, the \\"Green Pawn\\", was originally approved by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) for Bombing and Fighting Squadron 75 (VBF-75) on 28 October 1946. When VBF-75 was redesignated Fighting Squadron 4B (VF-4B) on November 15, 1946, the insignia was carried over for use by VF-4B. On 1 September 1948 VF-4B was redesignated Fighting Squadron 42 (VF-42). This squadron continued to use the Green Pawn insignia until it was disestablished on 8 June 1950. When a new Fighting Squadron 42 (VF-42) was established on 1 September 1950 they adopted the Green Pawn insignia that had been used by the former VF-42. In 1953 the insignia was carried over to VA-42 following its redesignation from VF-42. Grumman A-6E Intruder of VA-42 in 1973 wearing the Green Pawns symbol on its fin The Green Pawn insignia is a simple, uncluttered and highly recognizable design. The symbol of the pawn was chosen because it has the most potential power of any piece on the chess board. The pawn is canted at a 45 degree angle inside a shield design. It is also said that the aircrews said they were called the Green Pawns for two reasons: it was the Fleet Replacement Squadron (responsible for training new aircrew and aircraft maintainers; thereby, they were green, or new); and their squadron was a pawn which could be pushed around by the fleet and the senior commands. Colors are as follows: green pawn; background of the shield is white outlined in green; and the scroll is white outlined in green with green lettering. \\"Thunderbolts\\" nickname In 1992 the name and insignia was changed to \\"Thunderbolts\\" from the then recently disestablished A-6 fleet squadron, VA-176. On the insignia was a dark blue background, a maced fist and lightning bolt held by the fist. The stars in the background, still were shown in the count of 1, 7, and 6 [these were separated by the parts of the insignia]. Chronology of significant events Four of VF-42's Skyraiders in 1955 *20 October ‚Äì 15 November 1951: During training operations in the Caribbean, the squadron operated aboard three different carriers. They departed from Norfolk, Virginia aboard and then transferred to while the ships were off the coast of Puerto Rico. A couple of days later the squadron was transferred to while operating at sea. *January‚ÄìApril 1956: The squadron operated aboard the Navy's first super carrier, , during her shakedown cruise. *October 1956 The Squadron Flew from Oceana,VA to San Diego, CA to join the USS Bennington CVA-20 to test how fast a CAG could be re-positioned from the East Coast to the West Coast. The squadron was deployed aboard the Bennington for nine months. Visiting Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and crossing the Equator at the International date line. Thus making the Crew and Air Group Golden Shellbacks. The ship returned to Hawaii then to San Diego, May 1957. The Squadron returned to Oceana Naval Air Station. *24 October 1958: The primary mission of VA-42 was changed to the training of fleet replacement pilots in the AD Skyraider. The training involved all-weather flight training, low-level navigation flights, simulated special (i.e., nuclear) weapons training flights, conventional weapons training flights, and day and night carrier qualifications. *19 February 1959: VA-42 graduated its first AD Skyraider replacement pilot. *9 March 1959: With the acquisition of the T-28B aircraft, VA-42's instrument instructors used this plane to conduct all-weather flight training for the light attack community. *10 November 1962: VA-42 pilots flew three A-1H Skyraiders from NAS Argentia, Newfoundland, to Naval Station Rota, Spain, via Lajes Field, Azores. The squadron claims this was the first trans- Atlantic flight conducted by A-1H Skyraiders. *1 February 1963: VA-42 became the first fleet squadron to receive the A-6A Intruder. The squadron also initiated the Fleet Introduction Program for the all-weather A-6A. VA-42's new mission was the training of A-6A Bombardier/Navigators, also known as B/N's, as well as its pilots. It was also responsible for conducting the A-6A Fleet Replacement Aviation Maintenance Program which trained maintenance personnel. *12 June 1963: VA-42 received the first A-6A (bureau number 149939) with a complete weapon system, thereby permitting the initiation of weapon system indoctrination flight training program for VA-42's instructor pilots and bombardier/navigators. *3 September 1963: Formal flight training in the A-6A fleet replacement program began with the convening of Class 1-63. This training was for VA-75 pilots and bombardier/navigators. *8 September 1963: The squadron's last A-1H Skyraider (bureau number 135324) was transferred. This brought to a close the training of A-1 replacement pilots by VA 42. VA-42 still maintained one A-1E and two T-28Bs for use in propeller instrument training. *14 October 1963: The squadron conducted the first fleet night arrested landings and catapult launchings with the A-6A aboard the USS Forrestal. *12 March 1964: The squadron's last T-28B was transferred, and the instrument training program for fleet A-1 pilots came to an end. Two days later, their last Skyraider, an A-1E, was transferred. One of VF-42's A6Es shortly before being launched from in 1984 *13 March 1964: VA-75 became the first fully trained fleet A-6A squadron ready for deployment following successful completion of VA-42's fleet introduction program on the A-6A. *15 December 1964: VMA-242 became the first Marine Corps squadron to complete transition training in the A-6A and qualify for fleet deployment with the Intruder. *28 January 1968: With the acquisition of the TC-4C aircraft, VA-42 was able to provide more training on airborne radar operation for A-6A bombardier/navigators. The new aircraft was equipped with a complete A-6A cockpit console and weapon system, multiple bombardier/navigator stations, plus ECM equipment, and other radar operational capabilities. *November 1968: VA-42's A-6A pilot training syllabus was modified to include lessons learned from the Intruder's employment in combat. The new tactics phase included air combat maneuvering and AIM-9 Sidewinder missile shoots, while conventional weapons training was made more realistic. *12 November 1969: With the acquisition of the updated Intruder, the A-6B, in June 1969, the squadron developed a new training syllabus for the A-6B Standard ARM aircraft and a detachment from VA-165 became the first to complete this course of instruction on November 12, 1969. *21 November 1969: The squadron assumed the duties of providing A-6 orientation training for Air Intelligence Officers reporting to fleet A-6 squadrons. Lieutenant(jg) Erickson became the first Air Intelligence Officer to complete the training on November 21, 1969. *1 October 1971: When COMMATWING ONE was established on 1 October, VA-42 was reassigned from COMFAIRNORFOLK to this command, and VA-42's Commanding Officer, CDR Andrassy, was also assigned as Commander of Medium Attack Wing One, making him dual- hatted. *5 January 1973: VA-42's Commanding Officer, CDR Zick, was relieved of his duties as COMMATWING ONE by CAPT Turk ending the dual-hatted role of the squadron's commanding officer. *1980: Lieutenant (jg) Beth Hubert was trained as an A-6 Intruder pilot by VA-42 and became the first woman naval aviator to qualify as an A-6 pilot. *January 1982: VA-42 implemented a training program for the Harpoon missile system. *June 1982: A VA-42 pilot became the first female naval aviator to make an arrested landing in an A-6 during carrier qualifications on . *19 October 1992: Name and insignia officially changed to \\"Thunderbolts\\" and old insignia of VA-176. *30 September 1994: officially disestablished.

Cologne was the provincial capital.  History  After the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna restored the Duchy of Cleves to the Kingdom of Prussia, which combined them with the other Rhenish lands restored from France (Prussian Guelders and the Principality of Moers) with the Rhenish lands gained at Vienna ‚Äî the old Duchy of J√ºlich and County of Berg along with parts of the Electorate of Cologne and the Free and Hanseatic City of Cologne and some other smaller territories.

In 1806 he became the first professor of natural history at Harvard, a position he held until his death in 1822. Biography pickerel, collected from the Charles River, Boston, 1790, by William Dandridge Peck Peck was born in Boston on May 8, 1763, the son of John Peck, a noted naval architect, and his wife Hannah Jackson.Essig 1931 His mother died when he was seven years old. In 1782 he graduated from Harvard College and though he aspired to become a physician, his father encouraged him to enter business. Peck was unhappy with his occupation and eventually moved to Kittery, Maine where he lived with his father on a small coastal farm.Obituary 1823Mallis 1971 Peck lived as a recluse on the farm for twenty years, only occasionally leaving to visit friends in Boston. He also suffered bouts of severe depression. Despite his isolation and disability, he studied natural history and became adept in botany, entomology, ornithology and ichthyology. He amassed a good collection of insects, aquatic plants and fishes and studied them with a microscope he built himself. He later claimed that he had first become interested in natural history after picking up a copy of Linnaeus' Systema Naturae at the site of a shipwreck on the coast. In 1794 Peck published Description of Four Remarkable Fishes..., the first American taxonomic paper on zoology. In 1795 he began writing on entomology and in 1796 he won a prize from the Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture for his paper on the natural history of the cankerworm, Phalaena vernata. Additional works on entomology followed, often accompanied by his own illustrations which demonstrated an aptitude for drawing. He also developed a correspondence with William Kirby, a noted English entomologist, and sent him many insect specimens. His scientific work brought Peck a measure of fame and in 1805 he was appointed Harvard's first professor of natural history. In addition to teaching, he was expected to establish a botanic garden at the college. In preparation for his new duties he was sent to Europe for three years where he studied in Sweden, France, and England. He served as professor until his death in 1822. One of his students was Thaddeus William Harris, who became a highly regarded economic entomologist. Peck was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1793 and became a founding member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1812, serving as the society's first vice-president from 1812 to 1816. After settling in Cambridge, Peck married and had a son, also named William Dandridge Peck (18121876), who became a physician and state legislator. Later in life Peck suffered a series of strokes that left him severely debilitated. Just before he died, Peck had another stroke that left him unable to speak so he penned a final request, \\"no funeral, no eulogy\\". Works Peck was never a prolific author. His writings focused on insects as agricultural pests and were published in farm periodicals. Some of his notable papers include: *The description and history of the cankerworm. (1795)Peck, W. D.

Prinsjesdag () is the day on which the reigning monarch of the Netherlands addresses a joint session of the Dutch Senate and House of Representatives to give the speech from the throne (); setting out the main features of government policy for the coming parliamentary session. The occasion is prescribed by the constitution, article 65 of which states: \\"A statement of the policy to be pursued by the Government shall be given by or on behalf of the King or the Queen before a joint session of the two Houses of the States- General that shall be held every year on the third Tuesday in September or on such earlier date as may be prescribed by Act of Parliament.\\" After the speech from the throne, the budget is later presented to the House of Representatives by the minister of finance. Speech from the Throne Ridderzaal in The Hague, Netherlands monarchs of the Netherlands in the Ridderzaal in The Hague The Speech from the throne, 2014. The first part of Prinsjesdag is the Speech from the Throne at the assembly of the States-General in the Ridderzaal. At around 12:30 on Prinsjesdag, the members of the Senate and House of Representatives enter the Ridderzaal. They sit opposite and to the left and right of the throne. The ministers and state secretaries sit to the left of the throne. Behind them sit members of the Council of State, the government‚Äôs highest advisory body. They all sit in the enceinte, an area enclosed by unobtrusive wooden barriers symbolising that the head of state is in conference with Parliament. Outside the enceinte are seats for the other High Councils of State, senior civil servants, high-ranking officers of the armed forces, senior members of the judiciary, the King‚Äôor the Queen's Commissioner of the province of South Holland, the mayor of The Hague and specially invited guests. At the stroke of one, the King or the Queen, normally accompanied by other members of the Royal House, leaves Noordeinde Palace in the Golden Coach (Glass Coach sometimes) for the Binnenhof, escorted by court dignitaries and a military escort of honour. Outside the palace stand an escort of honour and a military band. As the King or the Queen arrives at the Binnenhof, a band by the steps strikes up the Wilhelmus (national anthem). The King and other members of the Royal House salute the colour of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps (the most ancient regiment in the Dutch armed forces) and mount the Ridderzaal‚Äôs steps, above which hangs a canopy. The president of the Senate presides over the joint session. Shortly before 13:00, he opens the meeting and then appoints a number of ushers from among the members of the two Houses to escort the King and his entourage. On this occasion, male MPs wear their most formal dress, while female MPs try to outdo each other with extravagant hats. The ushers receive the King or the Queen and the members of the Royal House at the entrance to the Ridderzaal. The president of the joint session then announces the arrival of the head of state: a signal for all those present to stand. The King or the Queen then proceeds to the throne, from where he delivers his Speech from the Throne. In his capacity of (formal) head of the Government he announces the plans for the new parliamentary year. The King's or the Queen's Speech is not written by the King, but by the Prime Minister and the cabinet. When the Speech is finished, the speaker of the Senate proclaims \\"Leve de koning!\\" (\\"Long live the King!\\") or \\"Leve de koningin!\\" (\\"Long live the Queen!\\") which is answered by everyone present with \\"HOERA! HOERA! HOERA!\\" This brings an end to the joint session of the two houses. The ushers escort the King and members of the Royal House to the door. The president then closes the session. When the King or the Queen leaves the Ridderzaal, the escort of honour again forms in the Binnenhof, and the procession returns to Noordeinde Palace where he traditionally salutes the gathered crowd from the balcony. Proposal of the next year's budget Minister of Finance Onno Ruding carrying the budget briefcase, Prinsjedag 1983 After lunch, the Minister of Finance proposes the next year's national budget and the Budget Memorandum (the Miljoenennota) to the House of Representatives. Since 1947, the budget submitted is carried in a special briefcase in imitation of the British Budget Day tradition. The current briefcase was made in 1964 and has printed on it in Dutch: \\"Third Tuesday of September\\".https://www.government.nl/topics/budget-day/contents/budget- day/history-of-budget-day Due to the size of the case, it probably contains only a part of the entire memorandum. The presentation is followed by a cycle of parliamentary debates on the budget. These are called the algemene beschouwingen (general deliberations). It is the most important moment for parliamentary policy making, as MPs can amend the budget to finance specific plans. History William V, Prince of Orange In the 18th century, Prinsjesdag was one of the country's most popular public holidays and was originally used to celebrate the birthday of Prince William V on 8 March. Between 1780 and 1797 ‚Äî known as the Patriot era, leading up to the Batavian Revolution ‚Äî the day was used for demonstrations of loyalty to the House of Orange, which is probably why the current name was chosen in the 19th century for the ceremonial opening of parliament. Historically, the constitution has stated that the opening of parliament should take place on a fixed date. The opening of parliament was originally held on the first Monday in November in the first half of the 19th century, and then the third Monday in October, but when a constitutional revision introduced annual budgets in 1848, more time was needed to debate the budget, so the date was brought forward a month. Monday was considered inappropriate, because many parliamentarians in distant parts of the country needed to leave their homes on Sunday to make it to The Hague in time, so in 1887 Prinsjesdag was moved to Tuesday. Throughout the years 1815 to 1904, the speech from the throne was given in the assembly room of the House of Representatives, but it was moved back to the Hall of Knights after an extensive restoration of the building at the start of the 20th century. The pomp and circumstance is still very much part of the day. 2010 incident On Prinsjesdag 2010, a mentally disturbed man threw a tea light holder towards the Golden Coach, which suffered minor scratches to the paintwork as a result. The man was sentenced to a year in a psychiatric clinic for insulting the Queen, damaging the Golden Coach, and assaulting the coach's footmen. He was found to be mentally incapable.

Section I General conception of the Nature of Ratiocination [Vernunftschl√ºsse] A judgment is the comparison of a subject or thing with a predicate or attribute [also called a \\"mark\\"]. The comparison is made by using the copula or linking verb \\"is\\" or its negative \\"is not.\\" Therefore, a judgment is a declarative sentence, which is a categorical proposition. Example: The tiger is four-footed. A predicate can also have its own predicate. In the example, the predicate \\"four-footed\\" can, itself, have the further predicate \\"animal.\\" One of these predicates is immediately and directly connected to the subject or thing. The other predicate is mediate and indirectly connected to the subject. \\"The tiger ----------is---------- a four-footed---------- animal.\\" (Subject)----------(Copula)-----(Immediate Predicate)------(Mediate Predicate) In order to have clear knowledge of the relation between a predicate and a subject, I can consider a predicate to be a mediate predicate. Between this mediate predicate or attribute, I can place an intermediate predicate. For example, in the judgment \\"the sun is luminous,\\" I attempt a clarification by inserting the predicate \\"star,\\" which then becomes an immediate predicate, intermediate between the subject \\"sun\\" and the mediate predicate \\"luminous.\\" The sun is a star that is luminous.\\" Sun = subject Is = copula Star = immediate predicate (intermediate predicate) (middle term) Luminous = remote mediate predicate Kant calls this process ratiocination. It is the comparison of a remote, mediate predicate with a subject through the use of an intermediate predicate. The intermediate predicate is called the middle term of a rational inference. The comparison of a subject with a remote, mediate predicate occurs through three judgments: #Luminous is a predicate of star; #Star is a predicate of sun; #Luminous is a predicate of sun (the original judgment). This can be stated as an affirmative ratiocination: Every star is luminous; the sun is a star; consequently the sun is luminous. Note: Kant's examples utilized obscure subjects such as Soul, Spirit, and God and their supposed predicates. These do not facilitate easy comprehension because these subjects are not encountered in everyday experience and consequently their predicates are not evident. Section II Of the Supreme Rules of all Ratiocination Kant declared that the primary, universal rule of all affirmative ratiocination is: A predicate of a predicate is a predicate of the subject (grammar). The primary, universal rule of all negative ratiocination is: Whatever is inconsistent with the predicate of a subject is inconsistent with the subject. Because proof is possible only through ratiocination, these rules can't be proved. Such a proof would assume the truth of these rules and would therefore be circular. However, it can be shown that these rules are the primary, universal rules of all ratiocination. This can be done by showing that other rules, that were thought to be primary, are based on these rules. The dictum de omni is the highest principle of affirmative syllogisms. It says: Whatever is universally affirmed of a concept is also affirmed of everything contained under it. This is grounded on the rule of affirmative ratiocination. A concept that contains other concepts has been abstracted from them and is a predicate. Whatever belongs to this concept is a predicate of other predicates and therefore a predicate of the subject. The dictum de nullo says: Whatever is denied of a concept is also denied of everything that is contained under it. The concept is a predicate that has been abstracted from the concepts that are contained under it. Whatever is inconsistent with this concept is inconsistent with the subject and therefore also with the predicates of the subject. This is based on the rule of negative ratiocination. Section III Of Pure and Mixed Ratiocination If one judgment can be immediately discerned from another judgment without the use of a middle term, then the inference is not a ratiocination. A direct, non-ratiocinative inference would, for example, be: \\"from the proposition that all airplanes have wings, it immediately follows that whatever has no wings is not an airplane.\\" Pure ratiocination occurs by means of three propositions. Mixed ratiocination occurs by more than three propositions. A mixed ratiocination is still a single ratiocination. It is not compound, that is, consisting of several ratiocinations. An example of a mixed ratiocination is: Nothing immortal is a man, Therefore, no man is immortal; (this is a negative conversion of the preceding premise) Socrates is a man, Therefore, Socrates is not immortal. A mixed ratiocination interposes an immediate inference, resulting in more than three propositions. However, a mixed ratiocination may show only three propositions if the fourth proposition is unspoken, unexpressed, and merely thought. For example, the ratiocination Nothing immortal is a man, Socrates is a man, Therefore, Socrates is not immortal is only valid if the fourth proposition Therefore, no man is immortal is covertly thought. This unspoken proposition should be inserted after the first proposition and is merely its negative converse. Section IV In the so- called First Figure only Pure Ratiocinations are possible, in the remaining Figures only mixed Ratiocinations are possible. Pattern of First Figure: Subject...............Predicate Middle Term........Major Term........Major Premise Minor Term.........Middle Term........Minor Premise Minor Term........Major Term...........Conclusion A ratiocination is always in the first figure when it accords with the first rule of ratiocination: A predicate B of a predicate C of a subject A is a predicate of the subject A. This is a pure ratiocination. It has three propositions: C has the predicate B, A has the predicate C, Therefore, A has the predicate B. In the Second Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible. Pattern of Second Figure: Subject...............Predicate Major Term........Middle Term........Major Premise Minor Term.........Middle Term........Minor Premise Minor Term........Major Term...........Conclusion The rule of the second figure is: Whatever is inconsistent with the predicate of a subject is inconsistent with the subject. This is a mixed ratiocination because an unexpressed proposition must be added in thought in order to arrive at the conclusion. If I say, No B is C, A is C, Therefore, A is not B My inference is valid only if I silently interpose the immediate inference No C is B after the first premise. It is merely the negative converse of the first premise. Without it, the ratiocination is invalid. In the Third Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible. Pattern of Third Figure: Subject...............Predicate Middle Term........Major Term........Major Premise Middle Term.........Minor Term........Minor Premise Minor Term........Major Term...........Conclusion The rule of the third figure is: Whatever belongs to or contradicts a subject, also belongs to or contradicts some things that are contained under another predicate of this subject. An example of a syllogism of the third figure is: All mammals are air-breathers, All mammals are animals, Therefore, some animals are air-breathers. This validly follows only if an immediate inference is silently interpolated. The added inference is a conversion that uses the word \\"some\\" instead of \\"all.\\" All mammals are air-breathers, All mammals are animals, Hence, some animals are mammals, Therefore, some animals are air- breathers. In the Fourth Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible. Pattern of Fourth Figure: Subject...............Predicate Major Term........Middle Term........Major Premise Middle Term.........Minor Term........Minor Premise Minor Term........Major Term...........Conclusion Kant claimed that the fourth figure is based on the insertion of several immediate inferences that each have no middle term. The affirmative mode of this fourth figure is not possible because a conclusion cannot be derived from the premises. The negative mode of this fourth figure is possible only if each premise is immediately followed by its unexpressed, unspoken converse as an immediate inference. In order to be valid, the negative mode ratiocination: No stupid man is learned, Some learned persons are pious, Therefore, some pious persons are not stupid must become: No stupid man is learned, Consequently, no learned person is stupid; Some learned persons are pious, Consequently, some pious persons are learned, Therefore, some pious persons are not stupid. Section V The Logical Division of the Four Figures is a Mistaken Subtlety. Legitimate conclusions can be drawn in all four figures. Only the first figure determines the conclusion by pure, unmixed reasoning. The other figures use unspoken, inserted inferences. Logic should consist of open, not covert, reasoning. It should be simple and unmixed, with no hidden inferences. Previous logicians incorrectly considered all four figures as being simple and pure. The four figures were created by playfully changing the middle term‚Äôs position. This retained the rational conclusion but increased obscurity. Time should not be wasted on the study of the three mixed ratiocinations. Section VI Concluding Observation. The first figure yields a correct inference in a simple, direct manner. The other figures yield a correct inference indirectly by the addition of hidden inferences. They can be changed into the simpler first figure by changing the position of the middle term. Kant concluded the essay with several related remarks. Distinct and complete concepts are only possible by means of judgments and ratiocinations. A distinct concept is one which is made clear by a judgment. This occurs when something is clearly recognized as a predicate of a subject. A complete concept is one which is made distinct by a ratiocination. The ratiocination can be simple or a chain of reasoning. The ability to understand and the ability to reason are both based on the ability to judge. Understanding is the immediate recognition that something is a predicate of a subject. Reason is the ability to judge mediately. It recognizes another predicate in the first predicate, thus conceiving a subject indirectly by means of a remote predicate. Higher knowledge is based on judging. Framing a judgment is a reflection that results in a distinct concept. Non-human animals can have clear representations of things that are predicates of a subject. Humans can also have knowledge that a predicate is a predicate of a subject and are therefore able to make a judgment. Non-human animals can distinguish things from one another. The different ideas are the causes of their actions, which are irrational. Humans can logically distinguish between things by means of judgment. The higher knowledge of a human is based on the ability to make our own ideas the object of our thoughts. All affirmative judgments are based on the principle of Identity. A subject is identical to its predicate. All negative judgments have the principle of Contradiction as their foundation. A subject is opposed to its predicate. Judgments in which identity or contradiction is mediately known, by means of intermediate predicates and by means of the analysis of concepts, are provable. Judgments in which identity or contradiction is immediately known cannot be proved (See Section II). These unprovable judgments precede definitions because we must recognize a subject's predicate before we can define the subject. Reference in the Critique Kant summed up his thoughts on this topic in a short footnote that appeared in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, B141. He had been discussing the definition of judgment in general. Logicians had usually defined it as a relation between two concepts. Kant disagreed because, he claimed, only categorical judgments are so defined. Hypothetical and disjunctive judgments are a relation between two judgments. In his footnote, Kant asserted that the lengthy and detailed doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerned only categorical syllogisms or inferences. He stated that this doctrine is only an artifice or trick for giving the appearance that there are three more kinds of inference or modes of drawing a conclusion than that of the first figure. This is done surreptitiously by secretly concealing immediate inferencesAn immediate inference is one in which \\"from the truth of one judgment that of another may be discerned immediately without any middle term.\\" Immediate inferences are usually produced by the use of contraposition or logical conversion. For example, the judgment '\\"nothing human is immortal\\" is immediately inferred by contraposing the judgment \\"nothing immortal is human.\\" The truth of the judgment is understood immediately. An immediate inference is not to be confused with an immediate mark (predicate or attribute). An immediate mark is positioned between a subject and a remote mark (predicate). in the premises of a pure syllogism. The only reason that this was generally accepted, Kant remarked, was that the logicians had made people believe that all of the other kinds of judgments could be reduced to being categorical judgments. Kant claimed to have disproved this in his Critique, A 73. There he argued that a categorical judgment relates two concepts, whereas a hypothetical or disjunctive judgment relates two judgments.

It was part of District XI of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). History Founded on November 14, 2001, the newly formed Lehigh Valley Conference (LVC) rejoined most of the 12 schools that formerly competed in the East Penn Conference at various times from 1976 to 1997, before five schools left in 1997 to join the Mountain Valley Conference (MVC). (Phillipsburg High School had previously left the East Penn Conference in 1994 to join the Skyland Conference in New Jersey to be eligible for NJISAA football playoffs; Northampton Area High School had joined the MVC for the 1994-95 school year.) Eleven of these schools reunited to form the LVC, along with Nazareth Area High School who had previously competed in the Colonial League before moving to the MVC in 1994. One more former East Penn Conference school, Bethlehem Catholic High School, was admitted to the new conference in February 2002. Conference play began with the 2002-03 school year. In 2012, the two Allentown public high schools, William Allen and Dieruff, decided to join the MVC as associate members for football only. Then on October 2, 2013, the LVC voted to invite six Monroe County high schools: Stroudsburg Area High School of Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, East Stroudsburg Area North and South of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, Pocono Mountain East and West of Swiftwater, Pennsylvania and Pleasant Valley Area High School of Brodheadsville, Pennsylvania. The remaining MVC school, Lehighton Area High School, had already announced in 2012 they would join the Schuylkill League. Records Among Lehigh Valley Conference schools, Emmaus High School holds the record for most Pennsylvania state championships in all sports since the league's creation. Parkland High School holds the record for the most conference championships in all sports. \\"District Titles,\\" LVIAC.net.

Service Electric also broadcast a weekly \\"Plays of the Week\\" segment, sponsored by Yocco's Hot Dogs, which featured the best football, basketball, wrestling and other Lehigh Valley Conference sports highlights of the week. Sports Lehigh Valley Conference football Lehigh Valley Conference football teams routinely ranked highly in the state and nationally in USA Today's annual ranking of the nation's top high school sports teams. In 2008, Liberty High School won the AAAA-level Pennsylvania state football championship, was ranked second in the Eastern United States and 20th among all high schools nationally. In 2002, Parkland High School won the AAAA-level Pennsylvania state football championship, was ranked fifth in the East and 11th among all high schools nationally. In 2007, Parkland High School also appeared in the AAAA-level Pennsylvania state football championship finals (losing to Pittsburgh Central Catholic). In 2008, Liberty High School won the AAAA-level state football championship to Bethel Park. Liberty also appeared in the AAAA state final in 2005 and 2006, but lost. In 2010, Allentown Central Catholic High School won the AAA-level Pennsylvania state football championship, and was ranked fifth in the Eastern United States. They were also ranked in the top 50 nationally, according to maxpreps.com. High schools currently in the LVC were dominant in local football prior to the conference's formation. Bethlehem Catholic High School won state championships in 1988 (at the AA level) and 1990 (at the AAA level). Allentown Central Catholic High School won the AAA-class state title in 1993, 1998, and 2010. For 1993 they were ranked 10th among all high schools nationally. The conference also has been particularly successful in generating extremely successful collegiate and NFL football talent.

To date, 18 alumni of Lehigh Valley Conference schools have gone on to play in the NFL, and one of them, Chuck Bednarik from Bethlehem (now Liberty) High School, was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the top honor afforded an NFL player, following his 1961 retirement from the Philadelphia Eagles. In 2012, Allentown public schools Allen and Dieruff left the Lehigh Valley Conference to join the Mountain Valley Conference because they struggled against LVC powerhouse football programs. Girls field hockey The Lehigh Valley Conference was recognized nationally as one of the premier leagues in the nation for girls field hockey. In 2010, the national sports web site, topofthecircle.com, ranked the Lehigh Valley Conference's Emmaus High School as the best girls field hockey team in the nation for the third time in the program's history. Since its inception, close to 200 members of the Emmaus High School girls field hockey team have gone on to compete on the collegiate level. Emmaus High School has won the Pennsylvania state championship in girls field hockey 10 times and won the District XI title in 22 consecutive seasons, as of 2010.\\"Sportspersons of the Year: Emmaus' Butz-Stavin in a class by herself,\\" The Morning Call, December 31, 2010.. Wrestling The Lehigh Valley Conference is also recognized nationally for its hugely successful wrestling programs, which are widely considered among the most competitive and elite in the nation. Easton Area High School, Nazareth Area High School, Northampton Area High School, and other Lehigh Valley Conference high schools are usually national powerhouses and each competes at prestigious national tournaments. Lehigh Valley Conference wrestling matches, especially those between rival Lehigh Valley Conference high schools, are among the Lehigh Valley's most popular athletic events, often selling out large indoor high school arenas with thousands of spectators. LVC schools have won numerous PIAA state individual wrestling championships and six team championships, including three straight 2A team titles for Bethlehem Catholic from 2010-11 through 2012-13. A sign of its national stature, at one time in the early 2000s, the National High School Coaches Association had Easton Area High School, Nazareth Area High School and Northampton High School all ranked in their \\"National Top 25\\" rankings simultaneously. Individual wrestlers from Lehigh Valley Conference schools are often a fixture in national rankings, and collegiate wrestling scouts from around the nation recruit heavily among Lehigh Valley Conference wrestling teams. Division I collegiate wrestling is filled with wrestlers from the Lehigh Valley Conference, and the U.S. Olympic wrestling team also has often included wrestlers from the conference. Many Lehigh Valley Conference alumni have gone on to compete in college wrestling. One alumnus, Bobby Weaver from Easton High School, went on to win the gold medal in wrestling at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Lehigh Valley Conference high school wrestling was televised locally on Service Electric, WLVT-TV and other radio and television stations. High schools The 12 high school teams in the Lehigh Valley Conference (and their locations) were: * William Allen High School Canaries (Allentown). * Allentown Central Catholic High School Vikings (Allentown). * Bethlehem Catholic High School Golden Hawks (Bethlehem). * Dieruff High School Huskies (Allentown). * Easton Area High School Red Rovers (Easton). * Emmaus High School Green Hornets (Emmaus). * Freedom High School Patriots (Bethlehem). * Liberty High School Hurricanes (Bethlehem). * Nazareth Area High School Blue Eagles (Nazareth). * Northampton Area High School Konkrete Kids (Northampton). * Parkland High School Trojans (South Whitehall Township). * Whitehall High School Zephyrs (Whitehall Township).

Dieruff High School and William Allen High School competed in all sports except (beginning with the 2012 season) football, for which they competed in the smaller Mountain Valley Conference. In 2013, the Lehigh Valley Conference invited the six Monroe County members of the Mountain Valley Conference to join the LVC. The schools accepted the invitation and formed an 18-school conference, called the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, that began play in the 2014-15 school year.

The village The village has approximately 225 residences and a population, according to the 2001 census, of 506. The village has three main meeting places, the Lady Emily Community Hall, St. Philip and St. James Church, and the public house, the Tarrington Arms (formerly Foley Arms). Mentioned in Domesday The Domesday Book of 1086, contains the earliest written record of Tarrington, where it is recorded as Tatintune, or Tatintyne. At this time, the manor of Tarrington was held by Roger de Laci, and under him by Ansfrid de Cormeilles, who came to England with William the Conqueror.A wee cottage was also mentioned, Norman connections Through marriage to a niece of the de Lacy family, Ansfrid gained 20 manors in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, including Tarrington. The manor of Stoke Edith, which included parts of Little Tarrington, was given to Ralph de Todeni, William‚Äôs standard bearer at the Battle of Hastings. In 1350, the manor of Tarrington was owned by Edmund de la Barre, from whom the name \\"Barrs Court\\" derives. The manor then passed through the Bodenham family to the Lingens, who also owned the manor of Stoke Edith. The English Civil War Henry Lingen, a Catholic, became a Royalist Colonel in the English Civil War, and was knighted by Charles I in 1645. The following year, Sir Henry made a heroic, though unsuccessful, defence of Goodrich Castle against the Roundheads, and as a result, the Stoke Edith Estate, which now included large parts of Tarrington, was heavily fined and effectively confiscated by the Commonwealth Government under Oliver Cromwell. It was returned to the family at the restoration of Charles II in 1660. Henry Lingen later became Member of Parliament for Herefordshire in 1661, but died of smallpox the following year. Ironmasters In 1670, Thomas Foley (1616-1677), a highly successful ironmaster from Stourbridge, bought the Stoke Edith Estate. The Foley family had benefited from the Civil War by supplying charcoal and iron needed for making cannon to the Roundheads, and, later, to the Restoration Government. Thomas Foley‚Äôs son, Paul, built a new house on the Estate and continued to expand it into Tarrington, he became Speaker of the House of Commons in 1694. 19th century According to the 1851 census, the population of Tarrington was 534, including 11 farmers, 2 masons, 2 wheelwrights, a blacksmith, a Cooper, 2 shoemakers, a builder, a rate-collector, a plumber and glazier, a butcher, 2 shopkeepers, a publican, a schoolmaster and schoolmistress, a doctor and the vicar. Charles Mason, Steward to Lady Emily Foley, lived at The Vine, and William Wallace, her Bailiff, lived at The Lays. 20th century In 1919, due to the depression in farming and the agricultural economy, parts of the Stoke Edith Estate in Tarrington and the surrounding parishes were auctioned at the Green Dragon Hotel in Hereford. The auction included the Foley Arms, Tarrington House, Tan House Farm, Free Town and many other farms and cottages. In all, 3,370 acres (1,364 hectares) of land in Tarrington and beyond were made available and passed back into individual ownership. However, a substantial part of the estate was retained by the family.

He also played for Leeds United, Sunderland, Oldham Athletic and Scarborough. Early career Snodin started his career as a trainee at Doncaster Rovers along with his brother Glynn under manager Billy Bremner, playing in midfield for the club. In September 1982, he scored a hat-trick in a 7‚Äì5 victory over Reading at Belle Vue, claiming the match ball ahead of Kerry Dixon who had scored four for the visitors. It would prove to be the only hat-trick of Snodin's career. Even though Doncaster were in the third division at the time, Snodin earned several call-ups to both the England Under-21s and the under-23s due to being such a strong player at such a young age. He soon caught the interest of the Leeds United manager Eddie Gray and was transferred to the club in the summer of 1985 for ¬£200,000. Bremner soon followed Snodin to Leeds and appointed him as captain, replacing Leeds' legend Peter Lorimer who had retired from the game. Snodin added class and bite to United's midfield and became the key player in the side. Move to Everton It wasn't long before Division One clubs approached Leeds for his services. Everton and Liverpool both offered ¬£840,000 in 1987, and cash- strapped Leeds accepted. Snodin chose Everton as his next team despite having agreed terms with Liverpool, and moved to Goodison Park in January 1987. Snodin helped his new club to win the title in his debut season. His never- say-die attitude was well received by the Everton fans, but it wasn't until Snodin played as an emergency right-back that he flourished for the club. This transformation to defender happened so quickly and with such ease that in February 1989 he was called up into the full England squad for a friendly international against Greece. Unfortunately Snodin was forced to withdraw due to injury and his problems worsened a few weeks later when he was carried off during a game against Sheffield Wednesday with a serious hamstring problem. Despite lengthy periods of rest and several operations, Snodin struggled to regain his fitness and spent the whole of the 1991‚Äì92 season on the sidelines. After Everton In October 1994 he spent a while on loan with Sunderland and then in January 1995 he moved to Oldham Athletic, ending an association of nearly eight years and almost 200 first team appearances. He later played at Scarborough before returning to Doncaster Rovers in 1998 to manage his home town club. He managed the club for 18 months before moving into radio commentary. Media career Snodin was a regular analyst on Sky Sports' coverage of the Football Conference, before taking on a similar role at Setanta Sports following a change in the broadcasting rights. He also co-hosts Terrace Talk, a football magazine show, with Liverpool legend Ian St. John every Saturday at midday on Liverpool music station Radio City 96.7 and City Talk 105.9 and occasionally commentates on Everton for the same radio network. He has written a weekly column for the Liverpool Echo.

Passenger trains ceased in 1938, but reopened in 1940-47 due to petrol and rubber scarcity during the German occupation. On 15 June 1957 the southern, rural half of the line was closed due to enlargement of Kastrup Airport. The remaining segment from Copenhagen to Kastrup was operated as a freight line until 1991 and officially closed in 1995. The company of Amagerbanen was acquired by the Danish State Railways in 1975. Route and traffic The actual Amagerbanen began at Amagerbro station, situated at the inner section of Amagerbrogade, the main street protruding from the centre of Copenhagen. Passenger trains never ran through to Copenhagen Main Station. Passengers needed to transfer by tram. A link to Copenhagen Freight Station existed by way of tracks belonging to the harbour, crossing on a low double swing bridge next to Langebro. A branch of Amagerbanen went to the petroleum harbour at Pr√∏vestenen. Human waste transport During its first decades of existence, the railway transported \\"night soil\\" (human waste) out of Copenhagen to be used as fertiliser for the intensive vegetable cultivation on rural Amager. Latrine buckets were collected during the night and brought by horse carriages to a facility east of Amagerbro station, the waste collection company later known as R98. The facility, colloquially called Lortem√∏llen (The Shit Mill), transferred the matter through pumps and pipes to railway cars holding three large barrels. The cars were more euphemistically known as chocolate waggons (chokoladevogne).Stations from Amagerbro to √òresundsvej, evp.dk (in Danish), access date 16 Sep 2019 Amager has often been called \\"the shit island\\" (lorte√∏en) by other Copenhageners. Passenger and freight traffic From 1930, Amagerbanen owned all omnibus routes on the island and gradually transferred passenger traffic to buses. Although the northern half of the line developed into a suburban area, the city mainly expanded into the centre of Amager and not along the coast. The southern area was much more sparsely populated. The intense freight traffic to the industrial area along the northern segment caused the railway to be profitable for a long time. Olsen Gang movie The railway was famously used in the 1975 movie The Olsen Gang on the Track. The gang robs an armoured waggon with gold bars and takes it on a detour to Amager with a stolen shunter locomotive. Criminal genius Egon Olsen falsely believes that the railway has been closed since passenger traffic ceased in 1947, and they almost collide with a freight train. Remnants today The tracks were mostly present until construction of the metro line M2 from the city centre to Copenhagen Airport, which was built in a trench along much of the same route as the former railroad and completed in 2007. Simultaneously, the former industrial area along the √òresund coast of Amager has been mostly transformed to a residential area along the constructed beach at Amager Strandpark. A remnant of the link to central Copenhagen exists along the harbour at Islands Brygge, and there is a longer track segment along the streets Uplandsgade (where the multi-track freight yard is situated) and Ved Amagerbanen. The association \\"Friends of the Amager Railway\\" (Amagerbanens Venner) operates rail-cycles and draisines on this route. The central inner section, along Svinget, Faste Batteri Vej and Store M√∏lle Vej has been turned into a gravel bike path. Some sources claim the path is placed between the rails still underneath and therefore 1435 mm (railway gauge) wide.Amagerbanen Part 1, the DSB link, havebaneremisen.dk (in Danish), access date 16 Sep 2019 The present Kastrup metro station is the only one where location and name are identical with the former railway station. The building still stands next to the metro. √òresund metro station is located very close to the former √òresundsvej station which was moved and preserved at the national Open Air Museum north of Copenhagen. The station buildings of Drag√∏r and Store Magleby also still exist. Stations were designed by architect Heinrich Wenck. Today's Amagerbro metro station is not identical with the former railway terminus, but placed about 500 m south of it. Although the metro terminus Lufthavnen (\\"The Airport\\") has the same name, the former railway halt Lufthavnen had another location. South of Kastrup, the route was bending westwards and the halt was situated at a road rather far from the original airport terminal. The location is now inside the airport, on the apron between the ends of the A and B piers.

As the southern part of the Liaodong Peninsula was ruled by Japan as the Kwantung Leased Territory, leaving Manchukuo with very little coastline, the leadership of the Japanese Kwantung Army regarded the development of a Manchukuo navy to have a very low military priority, although it was politically desirable to create at least a nominal force as a symbol of the legitimacy of the new regime. History When the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Manchuria in 1931, they were accompanied by a detachment from the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), which provided for coastal defense. However, the main naval requirement for Manchuria was the defense of its extensive border river system with the Soviet Union. Immediately after the Manchurian Incident of 1931, Kuomintang Northeastern Navy Vice-Minister Shen Hung-lieh and Fleet Commander Hsien Kung-che deserted their posts. Local Kuomintang commander Captain Yin Tsu-Ch'ien met with Japanese forces and agreed to turn over his fleet of five river gunboats to the Imperial Japanese Navy in Harbin on 15 February 1932. This flotilla formed the core of the Sungari River Defense Fleet (Ê±üÈò≤Ëâ¶Èöä) under the State of Manchuria. The Manchukuo Imperial Navy was established on 15 April 1932, by the proclamation of the \\"Manchukuoan Armed Forces Act\\" by Emperor Pu Yi, who also assumed the role of supreme commander. The flagship of the fleet was the destroyer Hai Wei, formerly the , a of the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, coastal defense for Manchukuo remained largely in the hands of the IJN 3rd China (North) Fleet. The Sungari Fleet was active on the Sungari, Amur and Ussuri rivers from 1933, and received additional gunboats from Japan. However, it proved hopelessly inadequate during the Pacification of Manchukuo, and the Japanese instituted numerous training programs in an attempt to raise its capabilities. Reserve or retired Japanese officers were assigned to the Sungari Fleet, and Manchukuo cadets were sent to study navigation and gunnery at the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy. In November 1938, IJN units were withdrawn from Manchukuo, ostensibly because the training levels of the Imperial Manchukuo Navy had risen to acceptable levels, but in reality because of the ongoing political conflict between the Japanese army and navy over who had control over Manchuria. In November 1939 the navy came under the control of the Manchukuo Imperial Army, and was renamed River Force (Ê±ü‰∏äËªç). In 1942, most of the remaining Japanese personnel serving with the River Force were also withdrawn. As half of its officer class was Japanese, this left a huge gap in capabilities and the performance of the River Force deteriorated rapidly. Many ships became inoperable, and their anti-aircraft guns were demounted and used in land-based operations. At the time of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the River Force was completely unready for combat, and disintegrated in face of the overwhelmingly superior Soviet forces.

The vessel was named after two counties; one in Alabama, and the other in West Virginia. The LST was constructed by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company of San Diego, California. Barbour County was launched in 1971 and commissioned into the USN in 1972. Barbour County took part in the Vietnam War, including the evacuation of Saigon and the Gulf War. The LST also performed disaster relief in Bangladesh. The vessel was decommissioned in 1992 and laid up with plans to sell the ship. This did not happen and the vessel was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 2001 and sunk as a target ship in 2004. Design and description Barbour County was a which were designed to meet the goal put forward by the United States amphibious forces to have a tank landing ship (LST) capable of over . However, the traditional bow door form for LSTs would not be capable. Therefore, the designers of the Newport class came up with a design of a traditional ship hull with a aluminum ramp slung over the bow supported by two derrick arms. The ramp was capable of sustaining loads up to . This made the Newport class the first to depart from the standard LST design that had been developed in early World War II. The LST had a displacement of when light and at full load. Barbour County was long overall and over the derrick arms which protruded past the bow. The vessel had a beam of , a draft forward of and at the stern at full load. Barbour County was fitted with six Alco 16-645-ES diesel engines turning two shafts, three to each shaft. The system was rated at and gave the ship a maximum speed of for short periods and could only sustain for an extended length of time. The LST carried of diesel fuel for a range of at the cruising speed of . The ship was also equipped with a bow thruster to allow for better maneuvering near causeways and to hold position while offshore during the unloading of amphibious vehicles. The Newport class were larger and faster than previous LSTs and were able to transport tanks, heavy vehicles and engineer groups and supplies that were too large for helicopters or smaller landing craft to carry. The LSTs have a ramp forward of the superstructure that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a utility landing craft (LCU) or pier. At either end of the tank deck there is a turntable that permits vehicles to turn around without having to reverse. The Newport class has the capacity for of vehicles, of cargo area and could carry up to 431 troops. The vessels also have davits for four vehicle and personnel landing craft (LCVPs) and could carry four pontoon causeway sections along the sides of the hull. Barbour County was initially armed with four Mark 33 /50 caliber guns in two twin turrets. The vessel was equipped with two Mk 63 gun control fire systems (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977‚Äì1978. The ship also had SPS-10 surface search radar. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a helicopter deck. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers. Construction and career The LST was ordered as the eighth hull of the third group of the Newport class in Fiscal Year 1967 and a contract was awarded on 15 July 1966.Naval Vessel Register The ship was laid down on 7 November 1970 at San Diego, California, by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Corporation. Named for two counties, one in Alabama, and the other in West Virginia, Barbour County was launched on 15 May 1971, sponsored by the wife of J. Victor Smith. The vessel was commissioned at Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 3 February 1972 and assigned to Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 7, based at Long Beach, California. Barbour County completed fitting out and trials in August. After a voyage to Callao, Peru, the LST concluded extended shakedown training in November. In June 1973 Barbour County and sailed on a training cruise to the Western Pacific for Naval Academy and Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps midshipmen. During the two-month cruise, the vessels visited Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Yokosuka, Japan and Hong Kong before returning to Long Beach on 3 August. Following an incident with another LST, Barbour County was sent back to the Western Pacific as its replacement. Once there, Barbour County was used to transport marines between the Philippines, Japan and Guam. On 20 January 1974 Barbour County was among the US vessels that sailed as part of Operation Eagle Pull, an emergency operation in the Gulf of Siam standing off the Cambodian coast ready to evacuate Americans and other foreigners from Phnom Penh, Cambodia. In mid-February the LST departed the gulf, returning to San Diego, on 14 March. Barbour County began routine operations off the US west coast until early 1975 with the exception of September and early October 1974, when the LST took part in Exercise \\"Potlatch 1,\\" an amphibious exercise with Canadian forces at the northern end of Vancouver Island. In April 1975, the ship departed for the western Pacific accompanied by sister ship . Once there, the two ships joined American naval forces off the coast of South Vietnam to participate in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Americans, other foreigners, and South Vietnamese from Saigon. The ship then returned to her normal schedule of troop lifts and exercises, calling at Okinawa, Taiwan and Subic Bay, before returning to the United States. Silver Strand in 1984. After a nine-month overhaul that ended in March 1977, Barbour County resumed normal operations. From 1977 until 1990, the ship made regular deployments to the western Pacific, based at Subic Bay, taking part in exercises, and making calls to Japan, Thailand, Australia, Korea, and Singapore, before returning to San Diego. On 23 April 1984, while training off San Diego's Silver Strand, Barbour County suffered two small fires, both of which were extinguished. On 25, while extracting from a landing, the vessel ran aground. The fleet tugs , , and the rescue vessel towed Barbour County off the beach. The LST was taken to San Diego for repairs. While moored alongside on 2 June, the vessel suffered a serious fire. Repaired only enough to be towed, Barbour County was taken to San Pedro, California to undergo an extensive refit at the Todd Pacific Shipyard that would last into 1985. In September 1987 while sailing from Pearl Harbor to Subic Bay, the minesweeper collided with Barbour County during a refueling attempt. Damage to Barbour County was minor and the vessel continued on to Subic Bay. Conquest was forced to return to Pearl Harbor. Gulf War Following the invasion of Kuwait and the beginning of the Gulf War, Barbour County departed San Diego on 1 December 1990 and sailed west, shifting to Central Command's operational control on 12 January 1991. On 17 January, following the start of air operations in Operation Desert Storm, the ship took up a position off Oman. The LST took part in Exercise \\"Sea Soldier IV\\" on 26 January, launching and recovering 12 amphibious vehicles near Masirah anchorage. The ship also operated off Fujirah until putting into Dubai for upkeep on 9 February. Barbour County sailed from Dubai on 20 February due to imminent start of the ground war. The two Military Sealift Command support ships for the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, and , could not offload at Al Mishab and were sent south to unload their cargoes at Al Jubayl. Barbour County was sent with them and 253 marines landed on the ship via helicopter. Anchoring off Al Mishab on 25 February, the ship unloaded troops and equipment and returned to sea. The ship returned to Al Mishab on 2 March and began embarking troops and equipment following the ceasefire in the region. The LST spent the next four weeks in the Persian Gulf on contingency operations. On 7 May, Barbour County sailed into the Arabian Sea. On 12 May, Barbour County was ordered to assist in disaster relief of typhoon in Bangladesh. Anchoring in the Bay of Bengal on 15 May, the ship operated for two weeks in support of Operation Sea Angel. The tank landing ship returned to San Diego on 30 June. Fate Barbour County was decommissioned at San Diego on 30 March 1992. The LST was later towed to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Pearl Harbor for transfer to a foreign navy. This did not take place, and the ship was struck from the Navy list on 13 July 2001. On 6 April 2004 Barbour County was sunk as a target ship.

The moCa is the only contemporary art venue of its kind in the Cleveland region. The organisation was founded by Marjorie Talalay, Agnes Gund, and Nina Castelli Sundell in 1968 and has undergone several name and venue changes in the years following its 1968 founding. Originally known as The New Gallery, the museum was rebranded as the Cleveland Centre for Contemporary Art in 1984. The gallery has operated under its current branding as the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland (moCa) since 2002.  History   1968  In its formative years the gallery was run by co-founder Marjorie Talalay and her husband Anselm; however, it has since existed in different forms since its 1968 conception as The New Gallery. The New Gallery originated as a for-profit gallery and occupied a repurposed dry-cleaning storefront at 11301 Euclid Avenue, on the corner of Ford Drive.  1974 - 1990  In 1974 the organisation was restructured as a non-for profit organisation and underwent its first name change to the Cleveland Centre for Contemporary Art (CCCA) in 1984. The museum was then relocated to the second floor of the Cleveland Playhouse Complex. This move in 1990 enabled an expansion of their exhibition space to consist of a 20,000-square-foot (1900m2) occupation in the former Sears store on East 86th Street and Carnegie Avenue; a space that was retrofit by Richard Fleischman + Partners Architects. 2012 Construction of the moCa  1996 - 2018  In 1996 Jill Snyder assumed the position of museum‚Äôs Executive Director. Snyder‚Äôs involvement guided the museum‚Äôs reputation and financial growth as in 2002 she initiated the rebranding from Cleveland Centre for Contemporary Art to the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland. Snyder‚Äôs development of the moCa predominantly manifest in support of the organisation‚Äôs relocation to Cleveland‚Äôs Uptown. The Uptown cultural district of Cleveland borders Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Institute of Art. In 2011 Snyder reiterated the intention to return the museum to Euclid Avenue and on the 8th of October the newest iteration of the moCa was opened. The $27.2 million building on the intersection of Mayfield Road retains a similar gallery scale to past Cleveland Playhouse Complex. In 2018 the Museum of Contemporary Art rebranded their acronym from MOCA to moCa to reflect their contemporary art ethos by drawing focus to the lowercase ‚Äúc‚Äù.  2020  In response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 and the ongoing international 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland has remained closed since the 16th March 2020.  Awards  At present, the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland has been bestowed the following awards: * Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Silver Status for Sustainability * Dominion Community Impact Award (2014) * Rudy Bruner for Urban Excellence (RBA), Silver Medal (2015)  Architecture  The 2012 design of the moCa was led by British-Iranian architect Farshid Moussavi and Foreign Office Architects (FOA). Moussavi with a budget of $18.7 million USD worked alongside the American architectural firm Westlake Reed Leskosky (WRL) to create the four-storey, 34,000-square foot project. The design was initially released to the public in 2010 through online platforms, with the construction of the six-sided building spanning from 2008 to 2012.  Farshid Moussavi  Reflections in the Iconic Exterior Facade The architectural design integrates the museum within the surrounding Uptown and encourages an interaction through the building‚Äôs fa√ßade. From the ground floor the moCa is accessible along all sides of the fa√ßade with the main entrance positioned facing east and overlooking Toby‚Äôs Plaza (designed by the American architectural firm James Corner Field Operations).The project reflects the ethos of the museum and as described by Moussavi is ‚Äúdesigned to serve as a public ‚Äòliving room‚Äô in a cosmopolitan Cleveland neighbourhood‚Ä¶ (acting) as a catalyst for creativity and growth for the city‚Äù. The materiality of the building translates an idea of the creative motivations of the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland with Moussavi describing the reflective black stainless steel of the exterior as a decision to allow a play of sunlight and mirroring of the surrounding plaza. The designer relies on the use of reflective surfaces and shifting interior walls to create a physicalisation of the museum‚Äôs multiple identities, as both gallery and event space. The use of an electric blue wall and ceiling paint throughout the gallery spaces was chosen by Moussavi to enhance the display of the artworks. The consistent blue interior surfaces throughout the museum acts in a redefinition of the traditional ‚Äòwhite-cube‚Äô gallery setting.  Key Spaces  There are four floors in the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland. Visitors are guided through the museum by the Kohl Family Monumental Staircase that links to the Kohl Atrium and upper levels. The spaces throughout are primarily divided by ‚Äòswitch elements‚Äô of moveable, glass and guillotine walls, with the 6000-square foot top floor defined by these walls to encourage the flexible programming in the museum‚Äôs ethos. Additionally, there is a designated space specifically for media work and a lounge with a view of the Uptown that refers back to the importance of the structure‚Äôs integration within the site. Other notable spaces include the Kohl Atrium, Gund Commons, and moCa store; all of which contribute to the 'museum‚Äôs program and engagement with event hosting. The Gund Commons is a two-storey event space that occupies 1400-square foot of the museum. The current Deputy Director Megan Lykins Reich emphasises the key feature of this space as the garage door that can be utilised to close the space for smaller use by the Cleveland Foundation Lobby. The moCa Gift Store is also designed to be multifunctional with a cabinetry configuration that can be hidden away to provide another separate but open space for events.  Management   Admission  The moCa has maintained a strong presence within the cultural landscape of Cleveland. The contemporary ethos of the organisation is outlined in their 2015 ‚Äì 2018 Strategic Plan and cultivates an ‚Äúexperience of discovery‚Äù for visitors, with an ‚Äúenterprising approach‚Äù that is designed to reflect Cleveland‚Äôs ‚Äúcosmopolitan flair\\". As a non-collecting museum the organisation is afforded a high degree of flexibility in program and exhibition planning. Daily admission to the museum was made free (as of March 19, 2019) in response to their Strategic Plan and aims to foster visitor accessibility and engagement. The museum‚Äôs free entry was developed as part of their Inclusivity Initiative, alongside a ‚Äúdiversity-focused curatorial fellowship, an engagement-guide apprenticeship program, onsite programming refinement and education specialists.  Attendance  2014 moCa and the surrounding Uptown Museum attendance has fluctuated over the years. This reflects the successes of museum‚Äôs location and board of staff structuring. In the mid-90s, towards the end of Talalay‚Äôs directorship, the minimum record was 11,000 visitors.Under Jill Snyder‚Äôs presidency there was a growth in attendance to 20,000. In its first year at its Uptown location the moCa drew an upwards of 56,000. According to the Cleveland ARTS Education Consortium (CAEC) average number of patrons is 40,000.  Site Integration  In the wake of the moCa‚Äôs 2012 relocation to Uptown University Circle, the museum collaborated with a group of post graduate students from the neighbouring Case Western Reserve University to enhance integration within the area. The report responded to the increased visibility and visitation potential of the new Uptown site.  Education  A component of the aforementioned Inclusivity Initiative is the museum‚Äôs ongoing Education Programs. These include curriculums for children and adults of all ages through interactive tours and Learning Labs. Additionally, they present a number of artist talks, gallery tours and programs that interact with the wider cultural community.  Operational Figures   Founders  The Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland (previously known as The New Gallery) was founded by three figures. Marjorie Talalay co-founded The New Gallery and headed the organisation for the first 25 years. Nina Castelli Sundell, another co-founder of the original moCa is an American curator who, alongside Susan Sollins, went on to co-find the Independent Curators International (ICI). The third party, Agnes Gund (the former president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York) is an honorary trustee and silent co-founder of the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland. The American art philanthropist has both donated and loaned a large number of art works to the museum‚Äôs past exhibitions that has contributed to the museum‚Äôs contemporary development.  Directors  Following Marjorie Talalay's retirement from the position, and Gary Sangster's two year directorship, Jill Snyder was installed as Executive Director. Snyder has maintained her position as Executive Director from 1996 to the present day (2020), and previously held a directorial position at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Megan Lykins Reich has been employed with the moCa since 2004 and is at present the Deputy Director. In 2020 she contributed an essay titled Making an Urban Living Room within Georgia Lindsay‚Äôs Contemporary Museum Architecture and Design, Theory and Practice of Place that discusses the moCa‚Äôs design process and thinking.  Curatorial  The moCa is facilitated by a team of six curators; Courtenay Finn, Kate Montlack, Ray Juaire, Eli Gfell, La Tanya Autry, Thea Spittle. The museum's curation places a special focus on artists from Greater Cleveland and the rest of Northeastern Ohio, with regional group shows that are curated every two years. Works The Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, in its nature as a non-collecting museum, isn't restricted to traditional gallery programming, exhibitions or storage. In the early stages of its existence, The New Gallery has attracted works by artists in the likes of Christo, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. Today, the moCa offers an exhibition schedule that refreshes three times each year.  Selected Past Exhibitions  * In 2018, the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland celebrated its 50th anniversary. As part of these celebrations and the ‚ÄúOpen House‚Äù initiative to encourage a greater engagement between the museum and the public. * In 2019, the moCa hosted the first collaboration between Chinese artist Liu Wei and an American museum, entitled Invisible Cities.

The population of Starbeck Ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,226. It has many facilities, including Starbeck railway station, which serves the Harrogate Line. Frequent services depart to Harrogate, Leeds and York. History Starbeck reputedly takes its name from the 'Star Beck' (Old Norse st«´rr bekkr \\"sedge brook\\"), which flows into the Crimple Beck, a tributary of the Nidd. Starbeck was originally a hamlet in the township of Bilton with Harrogate in the ancient parish of Knaresborough. The township was part of the ancient Royal Forest of Knaresborough, which is situated to the south of the River Nidd. In 1896 Starbeck became a separate civil parish, but in 1938 the civil parish was abolished and Starbeck was absorbed into the Municipal Borough of Harrogate.Vision of Britain website In 1811, the Harrogate Workhouse was built in Starbeck. In 1858 the workhouse was closed because of the opening of the Knaresborough Workhouse. The railways come to Starbeck Starbeck signal box The railway came to Starbeck in 1848. The railway buildings gradually increased, and with them came a corn mill, malt house and water bottling plant. The population expanded rapidly in this period, most families owing their livelihood in some way to the railway. Decline of the railways In the 1950s the decline set in. In 1951 the Nidd Valley Line closed to passengers and the loop line to Pannal (under Crimple Viaduct) closed completely. In September 1959 the engine shed and marshalling yard closed. In 1967 the passenger service to Ripon was withdrawn. The last goods train travelled the old Leeds to Thirsk railway line from Starbeck to Northallerton on 9 October 1969, leaving only the current Harrogate Line. By 1969 the station was no longer staffed and the station buildings, goods shed and coal depot were demolished in 1978. Starbeck today St Andrews Church, Starbeck Starbeck, North Yorkshire, England The High Street shops include a chemist, post office, butchers' outlets, general stores, car dealership, motorcycle shop, veterinary practice, numerous fast food take-aways and a chimney sweep who sells wood-burning stoves. There is only one public house, after the British Heritage Society-listed Henry Peacock Pub, named after the master of the local workhouse, due to be demolished in 2016, was turned into a terrace of apartments with retail stores on the ground floor. Taylors of Harrogate's Yorkshire Tea factory, Betty's Craft Bakery, a large Morrisons supermarket and a branch of Currys/PC World lie within a nearby industrial estate. There are historical public baths in Spa Lane, in keeping with the spa history of the Harrogate area. Starbeck has been a frequent winner of the Royal Horticultural Society \\"In Bloom\\" award in the Urban Community Category.  In popular culture  The Forest Lane level crossing in Starbeck was used by Yorkshire Television for the filming of a scene in the Beiderbecke Affair. Starbeck also featured in a 1989 episode of Yorkshire Television's The New Statesman. Starbuck is a toponymic surname for families from Starbeck. In the nineteenth century a number of these families emigrated to the New World, including the Starbuck whaling family who became based in Nantucket. This family would be the inspiration for the name of Starbuck, a character in Moby-Dick, which in turn would be the origin of the name for Starbucks coffee.

The population is less than 50. History The settlement was first called Belcher after local ranchers of the same name, though the settlement was really nothing more than the headquarters of that 27,000 acre ranch. In 1887, the Gainesville, Henrietta and Western Railway was surveyed through Montague County, Texas, generally north of modern-day U.S. Route 82. Ranchers John and A. S. Belcher offered land for the railway's right-of-way, and the community of Belcherville was born. A post office opened in 1887. Belcherville continued to grow for the next 5 years, claiming 1200 residents and 51 businesses at the 1900 census. Among those claimed were five dry goods, two millinery shops, two of the largest hardware stores in Montague county, one of the west's most complete furniture stores, one bank, two drug stores, two mills and gins, a music store, one weekly newspaper, one large lumber yard, three blacksmith shops, and two beautiful churches. Belcherville was incorporated in 1891 and shortly afterward it became the largest town in Montague County. By this time it had a mayor and city council. Soon after its incorporation, the community began to decline. The catalyst for the decline was a dispute with the Rock Island Railroad over payment for a proposed local crossing (the Katy crossing). The railroad refused to pay, and routed the railway through Ringgold, Texas and away from Belcherville, triggering the beginning of an exodus from the city. But the biggest blow to the city occurred in 1893 on February 6 and 7, when most of the city's business district burned down. The cause of the fire is unknown, although it's generally attributed to arson. Belcherville received national publicity in 1948 when the post office burned and Postmaster John Reeves carried on his postal services in his automobile. The unusual incident was reported and pictured in the late Bob Ripley's Believe It or Not!. Belcherville also lays claim to some part of the early life of the late Amon G. Carter, a nationally known publisher, who worked during the early 1890s in a Belcherville livery stable. When the town voted to reincorporate is something of a mystery, but in 1958, it claimed to be the smallest incorporated city in the United States. In 2000, the population stood at 34.

Both the novel and Mossman are also subjects of Mark Moskowitz's Slamdance award-winning film, Stone Reader. The Stones of Summer, first printed in 1972, quickly went out of print after its publisher Bobbs Merrill filed for bankruptcy. Because of this (and, it is speculated, a subsequent lack of marketing), this \\"marvelous book\\" (reviewer John Seelye in The New York Times Book ReviewOverlook Press), saw minor sales. According to Moskowitz‚Äôs documentary, Mossman was also briefly hospitalized for a nervous breakdown while completing the novel, which may have also impeded its commercial success. Plot summary The Stones of Summer follows the life of Dawes Oldham Williams (D.O.W.) from childhood to teenage years in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and finally adulthood. The book is divided into three sections. Section 1 Section 1 describes Williams' experiences in grade school and on a vacation to his grandfather's farm in Dawes City, Iowa, a depressed town built by Williams' once-prosperous and now ruined ancestors, which, though dead, are still ruined. In school, Dawes takes interest mostly in disorderly behavior; he idolizes and befriends the profane and often obnoxious Ronnie Crown, and to some extent emulates Crown's rebelliousness. In one climactic moment, Dawes, Crown, and a friend exact revenge on a Cedar Rapids neighbor by blowing up her garage with a stick of dynamite. After the explosion, the three boys evade the police by hiding in empty coffins in a nearby building. Section 1 also follows Dawes and his parents, Simpson and Leone, on a visit to Dawes and Leone's ancestral hometown, Dawes City, Iowa. There, the Dawes and his family visit his maternal grandparents. Dawes' grandfather, Arthur, is a greyhound breeder whose success is waning. Dawes' experiences with his grandfather are awkward and often painful: Dawes is already a strange boy, and Arthur's ridicule often compounds his grandson's odd behavior. Despite this, Dawes sometimes feels a bond with Arthur, especially when it comes to the dogs, and after running errands with Arthur in town. While running errands, Arthur takes Dawes to the barber for a haircut and demands that his head be shaved. After the haircut, Arthur leaves Dawes with Abigail Winas, an old family friend and cryptic chicken farmer with whom Dawes seems to be a kindred spirit. During the visit with Abigail, it is revealed that Winas' mental health has seriously deteriorated since Dawes' last visit. Winas tells the boy a mix of truth and fabrications about the reliability of history- especially relating to Dawes city- and she condemns Dawes' devotion to nightly Bible readings. Dawes and Winas' discussion frequently borders on friendly and antagonistic, a consistent theme throughout The Stones of Summer. At the end of Dawes' visit with Abigail Winas, she slays and guts three chickens for the Dawes' family's dinner. When Arthur and Dawes return to the farm, Arthur is chastised for getting such an extreme haircut for Dawes. Nonetheless, when the boy is asked whether he enjoyed his trip with Arthur, he is surprised by his own quick affirmation. By the end of the vacation, however, Dawes has a tantrum after Arthur acts mean-spiritedly in croquet, when Dawes had tried to play fairly. Fed up, Dawes destroys a part of the croquet set. As a result, Arthur beats his grandson with a board. Simpson and Leone chastise Arthur for the harsh punishment but Dawes runs away despite their defense. He returns in the morning after spending the night in the woods near another remnant of his defunct family's empire: a decrepit house within which he finds a sleeping Abigail Winas. Section 2 Section 2 of The Stones of Summer chronicles Dawes' teenage life and his escapades with best friends Dunker, Travis, and Eddie. Throughout the section, the three boys drink great quantities of alcohol, get into fistfights with strangers and each other, and engage in many picaresque activities, as well as car accidents. In this section, Dawes learns about sex well after his friends and eventually strikes up a romance with school girlfriends Becky Thatcher and later Summer Letch. This entire section is brimming with sexual undertones- whether Dawes and his friends are cruising for girls, or Dawes is experimenting with Summer in a doomed relationship, or the four boys watch a disturbing carnival peep show. This section ends in a terrible loss, though, at the end of the summer before college. As Dawes and his three best friends are speeding away from their final revenge upon a farmer who once chased them away with shotgun fire, their convertible leaves the road and Travis, Dunker, and Eddie are killed. Only Dawes survives after miraculously escaping from the out-of-control car before it crashes into the ravine below. Section 3 This great loss apparently leaves Dawes inconsolable and finally sends him over the edge of reason. Ten years have passed, and Dawes is in Mexico with a young woman. The literate Dawes' writings while in Mexico illustrate his poor mental health. Additionally, Dawes' conversations with others are much more cryptic and sarcastic. He is cruel to his Mexican girlfriend- who even seems to understand him somewhat. The section itself is schizophrenically-constructed and jumps back and forth through time. Throughout the section, it is revealed that Dawes has had stints in a mental institution. After leaving the hospital, Dawes decides to get drunk at an old hangout. He gets into a fight after refusing to pay a $5 bet at the pool table, and winds up on the floor after being hit with a pool cue. Dawes follows the attacker outside, where he is urinating on a nearby wall. Dawes convinces the man that he can urinate great distances and tricks him into an elaborate and far-fetched ploy to teach the art of long-distance urinating. Dawes' tactics, he demonstrates, involve warming up on all-fours and breathing heavily before finally jumping to one's feet. As the man follows Dawes' advice, Dawes attacks him and severely beats him with an axe handle. With Mexico already in his mind, Dawes flees to his parents' house hearing the police sirens. They are surprised to see him. In this painful encounter, Dawes tries to borrow $100 from his father, but his request is peppered with verbal abuse, sarcasm, and vitriol, and Simpson refuses. Dawes destroys a cake that Leone had made for his birthday, causing her to cry, and he ridicules both of his very patient, confused, and worried parents. Despite their pleas for rationality, however, Dawes leaves in a fury, and kicks out two doors to the house. Leone comments that Dawes has lost all of his humanity.

The Stud originated in 1916 as a result of a gift by William Hall Walker (later Lord Wavertree) of the entire bloodstock of his stud farm in Tully, Kildare town in County Kildare, Ireland. As part of the arrangement, the British government acquired the Irish property along with Walker's training stables in England. In 1943, the Irish Government took over the Tully property and the Irish National Stud Company Ltd. was formed. The Irish bloodstock was then transferred to the Sandley Stud in Dorset. The stud's operations were expanded after the World War II with the purchase of a stud at West Grinstead in Sussex. In 1963 the decision was made to sell the Stud's mares and operate only as a stallion station. The two existing breeding farms were sold and operations consolidated into a single new facility built on 500 acres (2 km¬≤) of land at Newmarket. The National Stud's charity is known as the Wavertree Charitable Trust in William Hall Walker's memory and its Wavertree House contains a number of paintings he donated from his collection of sporting art. Currently the National Stud facilities accommodates up to eight stallions and as many as 200 broodmares. According to its website, the stud offers a range of services to horse breeders, including stallions at stud, seasonal and permanent boarding, sales preparation and quarantine for export.

The Golden Coach () is a coach owned and used by the Dutch royal family. The Gold Coach is used every year to carry the Dutch monarch from the Noordeinde Palace to the Ridderzaal in order to deliver the Speech from the Throne or the wedding of the Prince of Orange or the Princess of Orange. Composition The coach is made of teak wood, much of which is covered in gold leaf. It is decorated with paintings by Nicolaas van der Waay and various symbolic ornaments.Royal Stables at denhaag.com The coach was built in Dutch Renaissance style. It is pulled by eight horses when the reigning monarch is being carried; only six horses when other members of the royal family are travelling in the coach. Queen Wilhelmina wanted to be able to stand upright in the coach, which explains the bent form of the coach's roof. This increased height of the coach has made it more difficult to drive. History Queen Wilhelmina received the Gold Coach at her 1898 investiture as a tribute from the citizens of Amsterdam. The coach was designed and built by the Spijker brothers. Because Queen Wilhelmina wished not to receive gifts on the day of her inauguration on September 6, 1898 she actually took receipt of the Golden Coach the following day. The vehicle was first used on the occasion of the marriage of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik on February 7, 1901. Since 1903 it has mainly been used once a year, in The Hague, on the third Tuesday in September, Prinsjesdag, on the occasion of the Monarch's Address.Route of the Golden Coach; royal-house.nl In 1974 however the coach was not used for security reasons, due to the French Embassy siege.\\"Leeuwarder courant : hoofdblad van Friesland\\", Delpher, September 19, 1974. Other occasions when the carriage has been used are: * the wedding of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard (The Hague, 1937) * the baptism of Queen Beatrix (1938) * the inauguration of Queen Juliana (Amsterdam, 1948) * the wedding of Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus (Amsterdam, 1966) * the wedding of King Willem- Alexander and Queen M√°xima (Amsterdam, 2002) On Prinsjesdag in 2010 a man threw a tea light holder against the Golden Coach, causing minor scratches to the paintwork. Convicted of insulting the Queen, damaging the Golden Coach, and assaulting the coach's footmen, the man ‚Äî who was found to be mentally incapable, excluding jail time ‚Äî was sentenced to a year in a psychiatric clinic. In September 2015, it was announced that the coach would undergo a major refit for the next three to four years and that the \\"Glass Coach\\" would be used where the Golden Coach would be normally used. Controversy In 2011, MPs Harry van Bommel and Mariko Peters suggested removing the left panel, portraying Hulde der Koloni√´n (Tribute from the colonies). According to activists, the panel showed half-naked slaves making gestures of submission to the royal house. Historians, on the other hand, stated that the scene does not depict slaves or the royal family, nor is it a glorification of the colonies.https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/na-zwarte-piet-racistische-gouden-koets- in-opspraak~a0f181b0/?referrer=https://nl.wikipedia.org/ The panel shows the relations with the colonies at that point and, according to historian Susan Leg√™ne of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, refers to the discussion about the Dutch Ethical Policy that focused on a moral vocation that the Netherlands should feel towards the people in the colonies.https://www.vpro.nl/programmas/ovt/speel~POMS_VPRO_197132~ovt-18-september-2011-slavernij- paneel-op-de-gouden-koets~.html References Category:Royal carriages Category:Dutch monarchy Category:Spyker Category:1898 in transport Category:Vehicles of the Netherlands ","title":"Golden Coach (Netherlands)"},{"id":"7164136","text":"Peter Dean Gordeno (born 20 February 1964 in Kensington, London) is an English songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist, who has also been a live and session musician.

History Pre-1920 municipal limits of the City of Berlin (dark red) within the extended city area of Greater Berlin (light red) Map showing the new territories merged into Berlin in 1920 Berlin had been part of the Province of Brandenburg since 1815. On 1 April 1881, the city became Stadtkreis Berlin, a city district separate from Brandenburg. The Greater Berlin Act was passed by the Prussian Parliament on 27 April 1920 and came into effect on 1 October of the same year. The new Prussian province then termed Greater Berlin acquired territories from the Province of Brandenburg and consisted of the following: * The city of Berlin (Alt-Berlin); * 7 towns that surrounded Berlin: Charlottenburg, K√∂penick, Lichtenberg, Neuk√∂lln/Rixdorf, Sch√∂neberg, Spandau and Wilmersdorf; * 59 rural communities and 27 estate districts from the surrounding districts of Niederbarnim, Osthavelland and Teltow; * and the grounds of the Berliner Stadtschloss, which had curiously formed an estate district in its own right. The Act increased the area of Berlin 13 times from to and the population doubled from approximately 1.9 million to near 4 million, with almost 1.2 million of the new inhabitants coming from the 7 surrounding towns alone. Greater Berlin was then subdivided into 20 boroughs (Verwaltungsbezirke): * from Alt-Berlin: Mitte, Tiergarten, Wedding, Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain; * one borough for each of the 7 previously independent towns: Charlottenburg, K√∂penick, Lichtenberg, Neuk√∂lln, Sch√∂neberg, Spandau and Wilmersdorf; * 7 new boroughs created from the remaining added areas, each named after the largest village in the area at the time: Pankow, Reinickendorf, Steglitz, Tempelhof, Treptow, Wei√üensee and Zehlendorf Through that law, it became possible to implement integrated town planning across the whole of Greater Berlin. The Act was an important foundation for the rise of Berlin to a cultural centre of Europe in the 1920s. Apart from minor changes, the city boundary defined in the law is still the same as today even though its character has changed several times over the years. Originally a mere municipal boundary, it became a demarcation line between occupation zones after 1945 and part of the Iron Curtain after 1949, with the Berlin Wall on some of its length between 1961 and 1990. Since the Reunification of Germany, it is the border between the German states of Berlin and Brandenburg.

It produces forskolin, an extract useful for pharmaceutical preparations and research in cell biology. Name The Brazilian name is (, or , as opposed to the Chilean true boldo), (), () or () (Oxal√°'s carpet, because of its velvety texture). Taxonomy Coleus barbatus was first described by Henry Cranke Andrews in 1810 as Plectranthus barbatus. It was transferred to Coleus by Bentham in 1830. Although Coleus was previously sunk into Plectranthus, the original binomial was revived in a major study of the subtribe Plectranthinae in 2019. There has been some confusion over the synonyms of this species. Plectranthus forskaolaei was first described by Vahl in 1790. Vahl's name is illegitimate, because he treats it as a synonym of the earlier described Ocimum hadiense Forrsk. Vahl spelt the epithet as \\"Forsk√•laei\\", referring to Pehr Forssk√•l, whose surname is also spelt \\"Forsk√•l\\". The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants at Art. 60.7 specifies that \\"√•\\" is to be replaced by \\"ao\\". Willdenow in 1800 referred to Vahl's name, but spelt the epithet \\"forskolaei\\". (, the International Plant Names Index had the spelling \\"forskalei\\".) It was probably this species that Briquet referred to when transferring a species to Coleus as \\"C. forskohlii (Willd.) Briq.\\", introducing yet another spelling of the epithet; however, Briquet did not explicitly refer to a basionym. Briquet regarded \\"Coleus forskohlii\\" as synonymous with what he called \\"C. barbatus Benth.\\", although Vahl had originally given a different synonymy. Paton et al. (2019) state that the epithets \\"forskalaei\\" or \\"forskohlii\\" are incorrectly applied to this species, instead treating binomials with these epithets as synonyms of Coleus hadiensis, in accordance with Vahl's original use. Chemistry Chemical structure of forskolin Herbal teas made from Coleus barbatus contain rosmarinic acid and also flavonoid glucuronides and diterpenoids. The chemical constituents of Plectranthus barbatus showed activities in vitro, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Forskolin, which derives its name from the incorrect binomial name Coleus forskohlii, is a constituent of Plectranthus barbatus.  Ayurveda  In Ayurvedic traditional medicine, Coleus has been used to treat heart diseases, spasmodic pain, painful urination and convulsions.

The Republic of Pontus (, Dimokrat√≠a tou P√≥dou) was a proposed Pontic Greek state on the southern coast of the Black Sea. Its territory would have encompassed much of historical Pontus and today forms part of Turkey's Black Sea Region. The proposed state was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, but the Greek government of Eleftherios Venizelos feared the precarious position of such a state and so it was included instead in the larger proposed state of Wilsonian Armenia. Ultimately, however, neither state came into existence and the Pontic Greek population was expelled from Turkey after 1922 and resettled in the Soviet Union or in Greek Macedonia. This state of affairs was later formally recognized as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. In modern Greek political circles, the exchange is seen as inextricable from the contemporaneous Greek genocide. One of the proposed flags for the Republic of Pontus. History Greek colonies were established on the Pontus coast in 800 BC, and by the time of the conquests of Alexander the Great the local inhabitants were already heavily Hellenized. By the 4th century AD Greek had become the sole spoken language in the region, and it would remain so for a thousand years, first under the Byzantine Empire and then the Empire of Trebizond, a Byzantine successor state. In 1461 the Ottoman Empire conquered Pontus, but the remote mountainous region remained predominately Greek speaking for centuries more. Hagia Sophia of Trebizond In the early 1830s, the modern Greek state achieved independence, but with less territory than it holds today. Hellenic nationalists made further claims upon Greek-populated territory elsewhere. The Pontic Greeks were far from the new Greek state, and had few connections to it, so joining the new Greece was never strongly considered. At that time, many Pontic Greeks migrated to the much closer orthodox states of Russia and Georgia. In 1904 a secret society, the Pontus Society, was founded in Merzifon whose main purpose was achieving an independent republic of Pontus. The movement gained significant support and during the 1910s and 1920s, the Metropolitan of Trabzon Chrysanthos Filippides, who would later become the Archbishop of Athens, became a major leader in pushing for an independent Republic of Pontus. International societies of Pontic Greeks became connected with the Pontus Society in Merzifon and began significant lobbying efforts to push for an independent Pontic Greek state: most prominently in Russia and the United States. During this period, Leonidas Iasonidis became a primary leader in the movement for the establishment of a Republic of Pontus. Proportion of nationalities in the vilayets of Ottoman Asia Minor according to the Ottoman census of 1914. In 1916, during World War I, Trabzon fell to the forces of the Russian Empire, fomenting the idea of an independent Pontic state. As the Bolsheviks came to power with the October Revolution (7 November 1917), Russian forces withdrew from the region to take part in the Russian Civil War (1917‚Äì1923). Like Armenians, Assyrians and other Ottoman Greeks, the Greeks of Trebizond province suffered a genocide at the beginning of the 20th century, first by the Young Turks and later by Kemalist forces. In both cases, motivation was the fear of the Turks on losing the territory sooner or later to the local indigenous populations of Greeks, Assyrians and Armenians and the policy of turkification. Death marches through Turkey's mountainous terrain, forced labour in the infamous \\"Amele Taburu\\" in Anatolia and slaughter by the irregular bands of Topal Osman resulted in hundred of thousands of Pontic Greeks perishing during the period from 1915 to 1922. The Greek population of the city itself was however not targeted directly, as the local authorities refused to supply mass murderer Topal with weapons, and local Turks forced his band out of the city. The local Muslims of the city protested the arrest of prominent Christians.Library Journal Review of Not Even My Name by Thea Halo. Pontic Greeks that escaped the death marches went on to the mountains with women and children, and formed self-defense groups that were protecting the Greek and Armenian population, until the population agreement exchange in 1923. The self-defense groups are believed to have saved the lives of more than 60 thousand Pontic Greeks and Armenians.people.http://www.impantokratoros.gr/antartiko- pontou.el.aspx/>http://www.hellinon.net/ANEOMENA/AntartikoPontou.htm On January 8, 1918, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson enunciated his Fourteen Points towards a post-war order. Point Twelve specified that the non-Turkish nationalities \\"which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development.\\" This declaration led to significant activity to organize on the part of non-Turkish populations throughout Anatolia, including the Pontus region. In 1918‚Äì1919, Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos began a process of financial payment for repatriation of Pontic Greeks who had resettled in Russia during the violence before and during World War I. Following the Armistice of Mudros which ended World War I hostilities between the Allied powers and the Ottoman Empire, British troops landed in Samsun and occupied much of the region. At about the same time, with the beginning of the negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 to decide territorial issues in the Ottoman Empire, Chrysanthos arrived at negotiations to push for an independent Pontus on April 29, 1919. While there he presented an 18-page memorandum of support for the establishment of a Republic of Pontus. The proposed Republic of Pontus was to include the districts of Trabzon, Samsun, Sinop, and Amasya and cover much of the northeast Black Sea region of modern Turkey. At the Conference, Venizelos believed that an independent Republic of Pontus would be too remote for military assistance from Greece and too weak to defend itself against any Turkish attack. For this reason he opposed the creation of a Republic of Pontus and the discussion was largely ended. Later, it was suggested that the district of Trabzon become part of the newly created Armenian state by Venizelos, but this idea did not gain traction with the Allied Powers and violence in the area as a result of the Turkish‚ÄìArmenian War, the Turkish War of Independence, and the Bolshevik takeover of Armenia soon muted the discussion. In May 1919, the head of the Greek Red Cross for the Pontus region wrote a report indicating that security for the population was very precarious and assistance was necessary. In 1921 large part of the Orthodox Christian males of Pontus were deported and sent to labour battalions at Erzerum. During this time an \\"Ad hoc Court of Turkish Independence\\" in Amasya, which was controlled by the Turkish nationalists of Mustafa Kemal (later Atat√ºrk), sentenced several notable figures to death by hanging. Among them was the former member of the Ottoman parliament, Matthaios Kofidis. They were charged of supporting the independence movement of Pontus. Aftermath A large part of the Pontic Greek community resettled during the fighting and after the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, as part of the Greek and Turkish population exchange. Records find that 182,169 Pontic Greeks were displaced as part of the population exchange. Many of the Pontic Greeks left for the Soviet Union, which had been the site of earlier Pontic migrations and thus had family connections. Most of the rest migrated to Greece where they were given full citizenship rights (Pontic Greeks who migrate from Russia today receive similar privileges). In Greece the Pontic migrants were called P√≥ndii.

He played in a calm and collected manner and got a good run in the side during 1981‚Äì82 but lost his place halfway through the following season following the arrival of Glenn Roeder and Jeff Clarke. He remained at the club, playing only infrequently, and had a spell on loan at Burnley, before leaving for Leeds United in July 1986 for a fee of ¬£45,000. During the early part of his career at Leeds he suffered a series of injuries, limiting his first-team appearances. However once he had returned he won player of the year in 1988. Under the stewardship of Howard Wilkinson \\"Fish\\", as he was known, became a crucial part of the defensive unit alongside Chris Fairclough that won promotion as Second Division champions in 1989‚Äì90. His career was cut short however when he suffered a freak injury in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final against Manchester United in 1991, as Leeds went out 3‚Äì1 on aggregate.

In private life her name was Mrs. Galway Herbert. Theatrical Performer Wheatley was a member of the Theatre Guild companies for many years and performed with Ethel Barrymore and Lynn Fontanne. In May 1911, she joined the summer stock company at the Murat Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana.

They had been engaged for two years. \\"Mr. Herbert came here soon after the stock company season opened, and one day we just ran down to the squire's office and were married,\\" Wheatley told the Indianapolis Star. \\"No one in the company knew of marriage except Mr. [Leslie] Kenyon and Miss Lillian Sinnott, who 'stood up' with us.\\" (Indianapolis Star, July 8, 1911). In December 1919 Wheatley played the role of Mary in The Wayfarer. It is considered a modern Passion Play. The production began a short season at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York. The drama drew on impressions of World War I along with the social despair which had continued for ages of the Christian era. The play also featured Blanche Yurka and J. Harry Irving. Care For Animals The actress was known for her kindness to animals. She could not bear to see them abused or badly treated. Wheatley came upon a mule being beaten on Forsyth Street while she was a member of the Fawcett Stock Company in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1907. The animal was being beaten by a man with a hickory stick. She implored him to stop. Wheatley gave him a half dollar and begged him to restrain his temper. When she left the mule's handler was coaxing him in a soothing manner, which pleased Wheatley. Previously she had intervened to prevent small children from rocking a dog and stopped a cab driver from abusing an old horse. Last Days Her final appearance on Broadway came in October 1932. She played the role of Maud Mockridge in Dangerous Corner, a play adapted from the writing of J.B. Priestley. Jane Wheatley died in 1935 at the Memorial Hospital, 2 West 106th Street, New York City. She was 54 years old. Her funeral services were held at the Funeral Church on Broadway (Manhattan) and Sixty-Sixth Street. Miss Wheatley's husband was in England and was notified of her death.

In 1430‚Äì1431 Abu'l-Khayr, joined by VaqqƒÅ·π£, launched on attack on Khwarezm, occupying the regional capital Urganj. The Uzbeks could not hold the city, however, and retreated in the summer of 1431. Abu'l-Khayr's army pulled back to the steppe, where they defeated two opposing khans near Astrakhan. In 1435‚Äì1436 the Uzbek armies attacked Khwarezm again, and several years later they raided Astrakhan. Starting in 1446 Abu'l-Khayr and his forces invaded the Syr Darya region, eventually wresting some lands from Timurid control. The town of Sighnaq became Abu'l-Khayr's new capital, from where he later launched raids into Mawarannahr (Transoxiana). In 1451 Abu Sa'id requested Abu'l-Khayr Khan's assistance in battle against 'Abdullah. Abu'l-Khayr agreed to support Abu Sa'id, and the two armies marched on Samarkand. 'Abdullah was defeated and killed, after which Abu Sa'id quickly moved his forces into the city and locked the gates, leaving Abu'l-Khayr and the Uzbeks outside. To avoid reprisal, Abu Sa'id presented the Uzbeks with many presents and riches. Abu'l-Khayr Khan died in 1468 (though some sources say 1469 or 1470). After Abu'l-Khayr Khan's death two separate lines of descent controlled the twin Uzbek states of Mawara al-Nahr and Khwarezm. In the first decade of the 16th century his grandson Muhammad Shaybani finally succeeded in the unification of the Uzbeks and established the short-lived Shaybanid Empire, centered in Samarkand.

The merger gave the new party an overwhelming majority in the Lower House of the Diet of Japan; the two parties had won 208 seats in the March 1898 elections.

During the September 1898 general election, the Kenseit≈ç won 260 out of 300 seats contested; however, the party soon collapsed. Members of the former Jiy≈´t≈ç felt that ≈åkuma did not distribute the cabinet seats in fair proportion to their party, and joined with Yamagata Aritomo and other conservative elements in the Diet to criticize Minister of Education Ozaki Yukio for a speech which they felt promoted republicanism.

The former Jiy≈´t≈ç faction reorganized itself into the New Kenseit≈ç in November 1898 with Itagaki as its president, whilst the former Shimpot≈ç members formed Kensei Hont≈ç.

The commission will be assigned to amend the 2004 National Police Bill over the next year; the bill had been originally been approved by the elected parliament. Under the pre-coup legal framework, the premier had been responsible for chairing the commission. So far, two members of the new police commission have been announced, Pol Gen Phatcharawat Wongsuwan and Pol Gen Issaraphan Sanitwong. He was replaced by Seripisut Temiyavet in 2007. There was speculation about the motivation behind the replacement, as Kowit had earlier arrested several military personnel for alleged involvement in the 2006 Bangkok New Year's Eve bombings. On 2 August 2008, Kowit Wattana was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, replacing Chalerm Yubamrung for the latter position. On 24 September 2008, Kowit was appointed Minister of Interior in Somchai Wongsawat's cabinet, serving until the government broke apart on 2 December 2008. He is an executive member of the Pheu Thai Party, successor of the dissolved and banned People's Power Party. In September 2010 he was expected to replace Yongyuth Wichaidit as the party's chairman, but he demurred and asked Yongyuth to carry on. On 9 August 2011, Kowit was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in Yingluck Shinawatra's cabinet. He resigned from the office due to a major reshuffle of the Yingluck cabinet on 18 January 2012.

He was of a Welsh clerical family and his baptismal name in the Welsh language is given in charter sources as Gwrgan. He Latinised it to the papal name 'Urban'.  Early career  Urban came from one of the dominant Anglo-Welsh clerical dynasties of what was called in the eleventh century the diocese of Glamorgan. Two of his brothers are known: one called Caradoc the priest and the other, Gwrgan of Llancarfan. This would indicate that his family origins derived from the important clerical community of Llancarfan. The petition of the 'clergy and people' of Glamorgan in support of his election as bishop says that he had been consecrated priest in the English diocese of Worcester. This more than hints that Urban, as with several other known clerics from the southern Welsh dioceses, had been sent to England to be educated. He was already a leading cleric under his Anglo-Welsh predecessor, Bishop Herewald (1056‚Äì1104), occupying the office of archdeacon of Llandaff. At the time of his election as bishop in 1107 he was said to be thirty-one years of age, which if true would give a date of birth of 1076.  Inventing the Diocese of Llandaff  Liber Landavensis f.5 Urban was consecrated bishop 'of the church of Glamorgan which is to be found in Wales' on 11 August 1107 by Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, making a profession of obedience to the archbishop at Canterbury. The contemporary chroniclers Eadmer and William of Malmesbury likewise call him bishop of Glamorgan. But between 1115 and 1119 Urban re-invented his diocese, taking the title of 'bishop of Llandaff' settling his see on the clerical community beside the river Taff, some miles north of the castle of Cardiff, the centre of political power in Glamorgan. Urban made great efforts to increase the prestige of Llandaff. With the permission of Gruffudd ap Cynan, king of Gwynedd, he translated the relics of St Dyfrig from Bardsey Island and reburied them at Llandaff. In April 1120, he began the reconstruction of the small church of the Llandaff community as a substantial Romanesque cathedral church, some impressive work from which still survives in the modern fabric. By that time Urban was at work on his master- plan, the compilation of a dossier of documents by which he could pursue some major territorial claims against the neighbouring dioceses.  Bishop Urban and the Book of Llandaff  Urban's principal monument is the dossier he created to sustain the great cause he began in 1119 against the neighbouring dioceses of Hereford and St Davids, the Book of Llandaff, which was compiled between 1120 and 1134.Yorke Conversion of Britain p. 150 He used as his primary source a large cache of early diplomas and charters relating to the episcopal communities of south east Wales, some dating back to the sub-Roman period. He or his clerks deliberately edited these to present a fictitious continuity of bishops of Llandaff from the sixth century onwards, back to the times of St Teilo, the original patron of the Llandaff community. Copied into the dossier were Lives of the Welsh saints associated with Llandaff (Teilo, Euddogwy and Dyfrig) which Urban commissioned. The Lives present the bishops of Llandaff as presiding as metropolitans over the other Welsh bishops. Authorship of the 'Book of Llandaff' has been attributed to several men. Geoffrey of Monmouth, Urban himself or the hagiographer, Caradoc of Llancarfan, have all been suggested, but the evidence for each can only be circumstantial.  The Appeal to Rome  The most remarkable and long-lasting legacy of Bishop Urban's career was the epic case he pursued at Rome against the neighbouring dioceses of St Davids and Hereford. The first complaints against St Davids had been made before the death of Bishop Wilfrid of St Davids (1115). It may have been that which inspired the collection of documents copied into the Book of Llandaff. The wider case opened at the Council of Reims in 1119 when Urban presented a petition to Pope Calixtus II, where he asserted the primacy of Llandaff over other Welsh dioceses, the persecution of his church by Welsh and Norman magnates and the depredations on his jurisdiction by neighbouring bishops. Urban received protections from the pope and the extent of his claims were registered. Papal letters were issued to King Henry I, Ralph archbishop of Canterbury and the clergy and barons of the diocese in Urban's support. In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate, summoned the disputing parties to London to hear the case. The case was finally referred to Rome in 1127, and Urban travelled there in April 1128. Pope Honorius II decided provisionally in Urban's favour awarding substantial swathes of territory in Herefordshire and Deheubarth to Llandaff diocese. The archbishop of Canterbury's part in the affair was criticised by the curia. A further hearing at Rome in February 1129 heard the evidence of Welsh clergy and witnesses Urban had brought with him. Since the other parties did not appear, the case went to Urban by default. This brought the bishop of St Davids to Rome in 1130 to appeal against the decision. Urban's claims were increasingly obstructed both at the royal court and Canterbury. He found Pope Innocent II less helpful than his predecessors, when he met him at St-Quentin in 1131. In 1132, the pope referred the case to the archbishops of the Anglo- Norman realm for settlement, though reserving the final judgement to himself. Urban fought the case through several hearings in England in 1132 and 1133, and ultimately lost. Ill and aged now, Urban made a final journey to Rome, where he died early in October 1134. Though he lost, Urban's ambitions and energy radically changed the nature of the relationship between the papal curia and the church in England. Following Urban's epic legal battle, an increasing number of litigants appealed to Rome from decisions taken in English provincial courts.  References   Sources  * J.R.

As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser- Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller in 2016, Meantime Brewery was sold to Asahi Breweries of Japan in October 2016. History It was founded in 1999 by Alastair Hook, who trained at Heriot-Watt University and the brewing school of the Technical University of Munich of Weihenstephan. He started the brewery in a small lock-up on an industrial estate opposite Charlton Athletic‚Äôs ground, before moving to the Greenwich Brewery, 0¬∞ 2' 12\\" east of the Greenwich Meridian, and then to a site on nearby Blackwall Lane in 2010. The new brewery, including Rolec brewhouse, cost ¬£7M; by 2013 they were producing 50,000 hectolitres but a growth rate of 60% per year meant that they expected to reach their capacity of 120,000 hectolitres by 2016. In May 2015, it was announced that Meantime was being bought by SAB Miller, the world‚Äôs second-largest brewer, for an undisclosed amount. In July 2015 Alastair Hook was named Brewer of the Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group at its annual awards dinner. In the same year The Beer Academy awarded Rod Jones, Meantime's beer sommelier and brewer, the Beer Sommelier of the Year title. In August 2015, Meantime stated that production of their London Lager had, on occasion, been outsourced to Grolsch (another SAB Miller brand) in the Netherlands to meet demand, but that the Dutch beer made up no more than 10% of any bottle. Meantime confirmed that the use of Dutch beer would no longer be necessary after additional investments at the brewery, with the aim of keeping production entirely in London. Meantime was sold to Asahi Group Holdings of Japan in April 2016. The sale was completed on 13 October 2016. In January 2019 Asahi also bought the brewing division of Fuller's Brewery and its subsidiary Dark Star. Beers Meantime beer bottles, from left: Coffee Porter, Chocolate, Raspberry, Pale Ale Prior to September 2009, Meantime manufactured all the beers in Sainsbury's \\"Taste the Difference\\" range. Meantime brews a range of twelve regularly available beers which focuses on traditional British and European styles such as Lager, Pale Ale, Porter and India Pale Ale. In addition, it also produces an annual range of limited edition seasonal ales, which vary each year. Outlets Meantime owns and operates the Greenwich Union public house on Royal Hill, Greenwich and, in 2010, opened the Old Brewery bar and restaurant with brewery in the original 1836 Brewhouse of the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, making it only the second brewery in the world to be located within a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Meantime also operates a visitor's centre attached to its brewing site on Blackwall Lane.

Earlier it was a Wildlife Sanctuary declared in 1985. Chandoli Park is notable as the southern portion of the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, with Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary forming the northern part of the reserve Sahyadri Tiger Reserve The Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, including all of Chandoli National Park and Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary was declared by The National Tiger Conservation Authority as a Project Tiger tiger reserve on May 21, 2007. The Sahyadri Tiger Reserve was then estimated to have nine tigers and 66 leopards. Location Chandoli National Park is located near the Chandoli Dam between longitudes 73¬∞40' and 73¬∞53' E and latitudes 17¬∞03' and 17¬∞20'N in Sangli District of Western Maharashtra. It lies between the Radhanagiri and Koyna Wildlife Sanctuaries and forms the southern part of the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve. History The park includes historical places of note including 17th century forts of the Maratha Empire, Prachitgad and Bhairavgad. Most of the protected area was used an open jail for the \\"prisoners of war\\" of the early battles during Shivaji's rule. Sambhaji used Prachitgad as an observation point and recreational place. Geography The park spreads along the crest of the Sahyadri Range of the northern Western Ghats. It forms and protects many perennial water channels, water holes and the Vasant Sagar Reservoir. Elevation of the park ranges from . The park receives its water supply from the Warna river and reservoir as well as several other small streams and rivers. Flat topped mountains, rocky, lateritic plateaus called 'Saddas', almost devoid of vegetation, large boulders and caves are distinctive to the protected areas in the Sahyadri region of the Western Ghats. Flora The forest types seen here are a mix of Malabar Coast moist forests and North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests. In the dwarf evergreen forests, some tree species commonly seen here are the anjani ironwood tree, jamun, pisa (angustifolia), fig, Olea (diocia), katak spinous kino tree, nana or Crape myrtle (lanceolata), kinjal, kokum tree and phanasi false kelat (brachiata). Other trees dominating the landscape include asan wood or ain or Indian laurel, amla or Indian gooseberry, umbar or devil fig (hispida) and harra or chebulic myrobalan. Grasses commonly seen here include bangala or bluestem grass sp., dongari or golden beard grass (fulvus), black spear grass, kalikusli or tangle grass, anjan grass or buffel grass, grader grass or karad or kangaroo grass (quadrivalvis) and grasses belonging to family Poaceae, like saphet-kusli or Aristida funiculata].FAO Insectivorous plant species like sundews and bladderworts sp. are also found in this protected area. Fauna Nearly 23 species of mammals, 122 species of birds, 20 species of amphibians and reptiles are known to be resident in the forests of Chandoli. The tiger, leopard, Indian bison, leopard cat, sloth bear and giant squirrel are quite conspicuous here. Many prey species of ungulates such as the barking deer, sambar deer, mouse deer and blackbuck are present. A census carried out in 2002 by the Forest Department showed a rise in the number of tigers, leopards, gaur, barking deer, mouse deer, sloth bears and blackbuck. A similar census carried out in 2004 showed a rise in gaur population in the Kolhapur Wildlife Division from 88 to 243. On the 23rd and 24 May 2018, a tiger was camera- trapped in Chandoli, the first such photographic evidence in the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve in 8 years. Prior to that, it was estimated from scat DNA and model-based predictions that the reserve had 5‚Äì8 tigers in 2014. Development Work undertaken for habitat improvement and development in the Chandoli National Park include removal of invasive species, soil conservation and water conservation, vaccination of cattle, research, fire prevention, providing salt licks, demarcation of boundary, erection of watch towers, maintenance of nature trails, desalting water holes, development of grasslands, and procurement of wireless two-way radios. Threats The Maharashtra government has plans to set up the Karadi-Bhogiv hydro-electric project in the catchment area of the Warna Dam that is expected to use up of forest land. On a positive note, nearly 7,894 people and a significant cattle population resident on of land in 32 villages within the park. These villages have been successfully relocated to areas outside the park. This measure has helped to preserve and regenerate some of the vegetation in this protected area.

The line was to cross Montague, Clay, and Wichita Counties. History Between Gainesville and Henrietta, only the town of Saint Jo existed. Other towns vied for access to the railroad, such as Montague and Seymour; however, land for the right-of- way was offered across northern portions of Cooke, Montague, and Clay Counties, and the railway produced new towns along the route, to include Myra, Muenster, Bonita, Nocona, and Belcherville, Texas. Construction began in 1886 with the establishment of section houses and depot buildings in Gainesville; it was hoped at the time that of line could be constructed and be serviced by passenger trains by February 10. Fifteen miles (24 km) of track had been completed by January 7. The line reached Saint Jo before the end of January. In May 1887, the Missouri Pacific Railroad assumed control of the GH&W.; The line was consolidated with several others to benefit the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railway through Legislative act on April 16, 1891. At the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 6, 1891, F.M. Dougherty was elected president, R.D. Gribble vice president and J.L. Lindsay secretary and treasurer. The town of Ringgold, also along the line, would develop after the crossing of the Rock Island line in 1892. By 1900, the line had been extended, parallel to the Fort Worth and Denver Railway, into Wichita Falls, connecting to lines that ran to Abilene and into Oklahoma. Demise The automobile and America's love affair with it brought the end to the small-town rail lines. In 1969, the line was abandoned with the exception of a small stretch near Wichita Falls. In 1971, the tracks were removed and sold for scrap metal. Many of the towns that developed along the line vanished long before the railroad, but others continue to prosper without it. Portions of the old right-of-way can still be seen in various places (between Henrietta and Nocona, particularly). On the eastern side of Henrietta, a U.S. Route 82 bridge over nothing still stands as a reminder of the Gainesville, Henrietta and Western Railway and its contributions to north-central Texas.

Background Walker was a younger son of Sir Andrew Barclay Walker, 1st Baronet, a wealthy brewer born in Ayrshire who expanded the family business to England and moved to live in Gateacre, Liverpool, by his wife Eliza Reid of Limekilns, Fife. He was the younger brother of John Reid Walker. Thoroughbred horse racing A lover of horses, Walker was a polo player and in 1895 built stables near Liverpool for his polo ponies at what is now known as Grange Mews.More Pictures of Gateacre village, Liverpool at www.liverpool.ndo.co.uk Although he began racing horses, he is best remembered as a breeder and the person who introduced English racing to the Aga Khan III. As an owner his most memorable victory was that of The Soarer in the 1896 Grand National. He also won four Classics. Irish National Stud In 1900, Walker purchased the lands around Tully, Kildare town in County Kildare where he established a highly successful stud farm. He acquired a number of foundation mares that led to the breeding of such horses as Prince Palatine and 1906 Epsom Derby winner, Minoru. Between the years 1906 and 1910, he created a Japanese garden that is acclaimed as the finest of its kind in Europe and today is a major tourist attraction.http://www.irish- national-stud.ie/japanese.html In 1916, Walker gifted his stud to the British Government for the purpose of founding a British National Stud. In 1943, the newly formed Irish Government acquired the property and the Irish National Stud Company Ltd. was formed. Currently, the Irish National Stud property consists of and is home to some of Ireland's leading stallions. The National Stud In 1916, Walker gifted his entire bloodstock to the British government with the idea of creating a National Stud. As part of the arrangement, the government acquired his stud farm in Ireland that became the basis for both the Irish National Stud and The National Stud of the United Kingdom now located in Newmarket. Wavertree House at the National Stud and its Wavertree Charitable Trust is named in Walker's memory. In 1999, the Racing Post ranked him at number 24 on its list of Top 100 Makers of 20th Century Horse Racing. Art collection Walker's father was not an art collector but donated the Walker Art Gallery to the city of Liverpool. He would acquire a substantial collection of his own, among them the painting View of Killarney with the Passage to the Upper Lake by William Ashford, one of Ireland's leading landscape artists. In 1933, he bequeathed the Walker Art Gallery a sizeable part of his paintings collection plus ¬£20,000 to help the museum with its renovations. In addition, he donated a number of paintings from his collection of sporting art to The National Stud which are on display at Wavertree House. Politics and the Peerage In 1900, Walker was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Widnes. He served until resigning on 18 August 1919. On 27 October 1919 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Wavertree, of Delamere in the County of Chester. On his death in 1933, the barony became extinct. He was also appointed a deputy lieutenant of Lancashire in June 1910. In his honor, the Lord Wavertree Cup is offered in English FA football. His widow, a direct descendant of the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, was also an avid sports person who sponsored lawn tennis tournaments and offered the International Tennis Federation a trophy that was declined but later was initiated as the Davis Cup.

Life Born as Wali-ullah Abul-Mansur Khan, Ablai Khan belonged to the senior branch of descendants of the 15th century founder of the Kazakh state, Janybek Khan. At birth he was given the name Abulmansur. Abulmansur spent his childhood and part of his youth in exile, losing his father at the age of thirteen, who was killed in an internecine struggle by his rivals. First, he works as a shepherd in a noble Tole Bi and then Dauletgeldi Bai a herdsman. The ill-dressed and emaciated boy was called by the contemptuous name of \\"Sabalak\\" - the beggar. But Abilmansur, according to contemporaries, always carried himself with dignity and loved solitude. He kept this pen name \\"Sabalak\\" in order not to be noticed to his father's rivals as he was one of the descendant of Janybek Khan.http://www.tarih.spring.kz/ru/history/medieval/figures/abylai/ In the first half of the 18th century, Ablai Khan proved to be a talented organizer and commander as he headed detachments of the Kazakh militia during the Kazakh-Dzungar Wars. He participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s, for which he was declared a \\"batyr\\" (\\"hero\\") by the people. Ablai's activity aimed to create a strong and independent Kazakh state. He headed the unified forces of the Kazakhs and furthered the centralization of state power in Kazakhstan. Until his election as the khan of the three j√ºzes, Ablai had to compete with Khan Abul Mambet and his descendants of Middle j√ºz for leadership. Initially, Russia recognized Abul-Mambet Khan as the Khan of Middle j√ºz, while Ablai was supported by China. Ablai's talent in playing China against Russia gradually made him the unrivaled Khan of the steppe. Unlike Abul Khair Khan of Little j√ºz, Ablai never submitted to Russian rule. In 1771, at the meeting of the representatives of the three j√ºzes, Ablai was elected as the Kazakh khan. The Russian Empress requested that the title of khan should be recognized and officially approved by Russia. To that end, she sent an official letter to Petropavl, where Ablai was expected to receive the title in 1779. He never showed up at the fort, declining Russia's request to appoint him as the khan of Middle j√ºz. In contrast to Ablai, other khans and sultans had been competing for the lavish gifts and stipends of the Emperors of Russia in return for their submission. During the Qing campaigns against the Dzungars, Ablai Khan chose not to take sides. He sheltered the Dzungar Oirat taishis Amursana and Dawachi from attacks by the Khoshut-Orait King of Tibet, Lha- bzang Khan, as the Dzungar Khanate fractured following the death of Galdan Tseren in 1745. However, once Amursana and Dawachi were no longer allies, Ablai Khan took the opportunity to capture herds and territory from the Dzungars. During Amursana's rebellion against the Qing in 1755-56, Ablai Khan offered him sanctuary at one point and refused to hand him over despite the threat of a raid on his territory. However, by 1757, Ablai Khan had acknowledged Chinese suzerainty. Ablai was then confirmed as Kazakh Khan by both the Chinese and the Russians. He led numerous campaigns against Khanate of Kokand and the Kyrgyz. In the last campaign his troops liberated many cities in Southern Kazakhstan and even captured Tashkent. Then he proceeded to present-day Kyrgyzstan and won a furious battle with troops of local warlords. Upon his death in 1781 he was interred in the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi in Hazrat-e Turkestan. Legacy *One of his descendants was Shokan Walikhanuli (1835-1865), a Kazakh scholar and historian. *Abylai Khan University, founded in 1941, is named after Ablai Khan. *In 1993, Ablai Khan appeared on the 100 Kazakh tenge banknote.Kazakhstan 100 Tenge Banknote.ws *The life of Ablai Khan is the subject of the 2005 Kazakhstani film Nomad. *There is a ceremonial slow march in the Military Band Service named after Ablai Khan See also *List of Kazakh khans References Sources *Alexei I.

It is a colourless, flammable liquid. It is classified as a carbonate ester. This compound has found use as a methylating agent and more recently as a solvent that is exempt from the restrictions placed on most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the US. Dimethyl carbonate is often considered to be a green reagent. Production World production in 1997 was estimated at 1000 barrels a day. Production of dimethyl carbonate worldwide is limited to Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Dimethyl carbonate is traditionally prepared by the reaction of phosgene and methanol. Methyl chloroformate is produced as an intermediate: : COCl2 \\\\+ CH3OH -> CH3OCOCl + HCl : CH3OCOCl + CH3OH -> CH3OCO2CH3 \\\\+ HCl This synthesis route has been largely replaced by oxidative carbonylation. In this process, carbon monoxide and an oxidizer provide the equivalent of CO2+: :: CO + 1/2 O2 \\\\+ 2 CH3OH -> (CH3O)2CO + H2O It can also produced industrially by a transesterification of ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate and methanol, which also affords respectively ethylene glycol or propylene glycol. Reactions and potential applications Methylating agent Dimethyl carbonate methylates anilines, phenols, and carboxylic acids, but many of these reactions require the use of an autoclave. :Methylation of phenylacetic acid by dimethyl carbonate promoted by DBU Dimethyl carbonate's main benefit over other methylating reagents such as iodomethane and dimethyl sulfate is its low toxicity. Additionally, it is biodegradable. Unfortunately, it is a relatively weak methylating agent compared to these traditional reagents. Solvent In the US, dimethyl carbonate was exempted under the definition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by the U.S. EPA in 2009.http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/fact_sheets/voc_exemp01011309.pdf. Information about the EPA's action on exempting dimethyl carbonate as a VOC and petitioner's background information, public comments and other references are available electronically at http://www.regulations.gov, EPA‚Äôs electronic public docket and comment system. The docket number for this action is Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2006-0948. See http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1pfpr.html and scroll down to Jan 13, 2009 pdf for the rule. Due to its classification as VOC exempt, dimethyl carbonate has grown in popularity and applications as a replacement for methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and parachlorobenzotrifluoride, as well as tert-butyl acetate until it too was exempted. Dimethyl carbonate has an ester- or alcohol-like odor, which is more favorable to users than most hydrocarbon solvents it replaces. Dimethyl carbonate has an evaporation rate of 3.22 (butyl acetate = 1.0), which slightly slower than MEK (3.8) and ethyl acetate (4.1), and faster than toluene (2.0) and isopropanol (1.7). Dimethyl carbonate has solubility profile similar to common glycol ethers, meaning dimethyl carbonate can dissolve most common coating resins except perhaps rubber based resins. Hildebrand solubility parameter is 20.3 MPa and Hansen solubility parameters are: dispersion = 15.5, polar = 3.9, H bonding = 9.7. Dimethyl carbonate is partially soluble in water up to 13%, however it is hydrolyzed in water-based systems over time to methanol and CO2 unless properly buffered. Dimethyl carbonate can freeze at same temperatures as water, it can be thawed out with no loss of properties to itself or coatings based on dimethyl carbonate. Intermediate in polycarbonate synthesis A large captive use of dimethyl carbonate is for the production of diphenyl carbonate through transesterification with phenol. Diphenyl carbonate is a widely used raw material for the synthesis of bisphenol-A-polycarbonate in a melt polycondensation process. The most common route is described by Fukuoka, of the Japanese \\"Asahi Kasei\\" chemical corporation.Non phosgene Polycarbonate from CO2 \\\\- Industrialization of Green Chemical Process, Shinsuke Fukuoka (Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation) Alternative fuel additive There is also interest in using this compound as a fuel oxygenate additive. Safety DMC is a flammable liquid with a flash point of 17 ¬∞C (63 ¬∞F), which limits its use in consumer and indoor applications. DMC is still safer than acetone, methyl acetate and methyl ethyl ketone from a flammability point of view. DMC has a recommended exposure limit (REL) limit of 100 ppm by inhalation over an 8-hour work day, which is similar to that of a number of common industrial solvents (toluene, methyl ethyl ketone). Workers should wear protective organic vapor respirators when using DMC indoors or in other conditions where concentrations exceed the REL. DMC is metabolized by the body to methanol and carbon dioxide, so accidental ingestion should be treated in the same manner as methanol poisoning.

During this time, it served as the basis for many fundamental changes that sought to transform Turkey into a modern, secular and democratic Republic. *The ratification of the Constitution on April 20, 1924. *The list of 150 personae non gratae of Turkey, ratified on April 23, 1924 (revised June 1, 1924), declared about 150 persons, who were holding high positions within the imperial government or were fierce supporters of the Ottoman Sultan, unwanted in the new Republic. Amendments The first change occurred on April 10, 1928, which changed, inter alia, Article 2 and the sentence \\"Religion of the Turkish state is Islam\\" was deleted.beykent.edu.tr, TC Anayasalarƒ±, 1921, 1924, 1961 ve 1982 Anayasalarƒ±nƒ± kar≈üƒ±la≈ütƒ±rƒ±lmasƒ± Further changes followed on 10 and December 11, 1931 and 1934 respectively. As a result, women were given the right to vote and stand for election. In 1937, the constitution was changed twice. Law No. 3115 of February 5, 1937 enshrined the six basic principles of Kemalism in the Constitution. On January 10, 1945, the constitution was revised with Law No. 4695 in the sense of Turkification of the language and translated into modern Turkish. However, this recast was reversed by Law No 5997 of December 24, 1952 (published on December 31, 1952 in Resmi Gazete Sayƒ± 8297), which restored the constitution to its constitution before 1945.

Lindbergh Boulevard is home to Missouri's only traffic tunnel underneath a runway at Lambert‚ÄìSt. Louis International Airport. History Lindbergh Boulevard was initially a bypass of St. Louis, designated in about 1930 as Route 77 from Mehlville to the Chain of Rocks Bridge. The part north of Dunn Road, where Route 77 turned off to access the bridge, was initially Route M and later Route 140\\\\. Route 77 was later extended at the south end to the Jefferson Barracks Bridge, and US 61 and US 66 were realigned onto the bypass, leaving only this extension as Route 77\\\\. That portion became part of US 50 when it was moved onto the bridge, and US 67 eventually replaced Route 140\\\\. Route description Lindbergh Boulevard is signed as US 67 for most of its length and additionally as US 61 south of I-64/US 40\\\\. However, between Lemay Ferry Road and its southern terminus at I-255, it carries only US 50\\\\. Traveling north, at Lemay Ferry Road, it picks up US 61 and US 67 at Lemay Ferry Road while the latter continues as Route 267\\\\. It loses US 50 to I-44, at which point US 61 and US 67 continue north as Kirkwood Road, named after the suburb they pass through. The name Lindbergh Blvd is resumed north of Route 100\\\\. Shortly thereafter comes the interchange with I-64/US 40 where US 61 is lost to them traveling westbound. The remainder of Lindbergh Blvd, signed only as US 67, travels north through various communities before turning eastward north of I-270. From Florissant northward, US 67 continues as Highway 67 North, discontinuing the Lindbergh name. US 67 continues northeast towards the northern terminus of Route 367\\\\.

Nearly all of Malawi's Muslims adhere to Sunni Islam. Though difficult to assess, according to the CIA Factbook, in 2008 about 12.8% of the country's population was Muslim;CIA statistics such a lower figure is rejected by Muslim organisations in the country, who claim a figure of 30-35% (which is described as \\"wishful thinking\\" by Christian missionaries). According to the Malawi Religion Project run by the University of Pennsylvania, in 2010 approximately 26% of the population was Muslim, concentrated mostly in the Southern Region. History Islam arrived in Malawi with the Arab and Swahili traders who traded in ivory, gold and later on slaves beginning from 15th century. It is also argued that Islam first arrived in Malawi through traders from the Kilwa Sultanate. Two Muslim teachers, Shayhks Abdallah Mkwanda and Sabiti Ngaunje, also played an important role in the spread of Islam. According to UNESCO, the first mosque was built by Swahili-Arab ivory traders.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5603/ During the colonial era, the authorities in the country feared that Islam posed the greatest threat, as an ideology of resistance, to their rule. This view was shared by Christian missionaries, who greatly feared that Islam could unite Africans in hostilities and uprisings against colonial rule. The 1970s witnessed the start of an Islamic revival among Muslims in Malawi, as well as among Muslims across the globe. Recently, Muslim groups have engaged in missionary work in Malawi. Much of this is performed by the African Muslim Agency, based in Kuwait. The Kuwait-sponsored AMA has translated the Qur'an into Chichewa (Cinyanja),Proseletysation in Malawi one of the official languages of Malawi, and has engaged in other missionary work in the country. There are thought to be about 800 jumu'ah mosques in the country, with at least one or two to be found in nearly every town. There are also several Islamic schoolsIslamic organisations in Malawi and a broadcasting station called Radio Islam. A major Muslim center of learning exists in Mpemba, outside of Blantyre, funded mainly by money from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Demography A large number of Muslims in Malawi come from the Yao people, who are described as \\"the most important source of Islam in the country\\". Even before their conversion to Islam, many Yao chiefs used Swahili Muslims as scribes and advisers. As a result of their strong trading contacts with Swahili-Arabs, many Yao adopted Islam and the two groups often intermarried. The Yao form the largest majority south and east of Lake Malawi. Muslims can also be found among other groups, such as the lakeside Chewa people and Indian and other Asian Malawians. Muslims in the country have been described as a \\"vocal and powerful community.\\" Notable Muslims An important Malawian Muslim is Bakili Muluzi, the first freely elected President of Malawi from 1994 to 2004.

His hip hop, hardcore techno and house music mixes ranked him the world's No. 3 DJ by DJ Magazine in 1993 and his performances influenced significantly the music scene during this period. Allan today remains a major contributor within the UK hardcore scene. Biography In 1982, Allan took up DJing. Between 1984 and 1986, his mixes/remixes were featured on Piccadilly Radio, Manchester on various shows including those of Timmy Mallet, Chris Evans, and Tim Grundy. In July 1986, he was given his own show on Piccadilly Radio. He was originally filling in for the regular DJ on a 6-week vacation, but the reaction was so great from listeners that he was signed on permanently. He began featuring hip-hop and house. \\"Love Can't Turn Around\\" by Farley Jackmaster Funk was the first record Allan played on the radio. This track got the attention of the people in charge of the station and Allan was asked to explain why he was playing this \\"music\\". He said he believed this was what listeners really wanted to hear (having seen clubbers going wild to tunes like \\"Jack Your Body\\", \\"Jack the Groove\\" and many other underground Chicago label tunes at his gigs), and convinced them that his choice of music was right when the station's ratings improved massively. During this period, Allan produced a soul show called \\"Souled Out\\" and a hip-hop show called \\"Bus 'Diss\\". He would also have a house hour which would feature the seamless mixing he is known for. Stu Allan was a big attraction at Bowlers in Trafford Park, Manchester. His choice of high energy old school music made him a favourite on the rave scene in the 1990s. Frequently misspelled as Stu Allen, even on promotional flyers. Allan was also a regular DJ on the Vibealite rave scene, performing at many of their events across the north of England. Clock Between 1993 and 1999, he was one half of the production team behind Eurodance act Clock. As well as having commercial success in the group, their songs were also released as hardcore remixes under the pseudonym Visa and were hits on the underground. Radio In 1999‚Äì2000, Kiss 100 approached him to mix and produce the now legendary \\"Kiss Mix\\" (Mon‚ÄìSat evenings) which became the most listened to shows at that time in London for 14 to 24-year-olds. In 2005, he had a show named \\"Hardcore Nation\\" on Pure Dance. As of September 2012, Allan broadcasts on Unity Radio 92.8FM in Manchester. He hosts \\"Oldskool Nation\\" on Sundays from 9pm to 11pm. Since departing from Unity Radio, Allan broadcasts with OSN Radio.
