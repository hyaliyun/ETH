The palace was erected in 1690‚Äì1700 by voivode of Polock Dominik S≈Çuszko of the Clan of Ostoja, who ordered creating an artificial peninsula on Neris for the purpose of building the palace there. The peninsula was formed from the soil of the leveled down hill separating Antakalnis from the Vilnius Castles. Initially the fa√ßades of the palace were unified by a giant order of Ionic pilasters framing huge windows. It is believed that the decoration works of the palace were performed by Michelangelo Palloni and Giovanni Pietro Perti who was the architect of the palace. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian rulers used to stay in the palace during their visits in the city after the Royal Palace was damaged. The Russian tsar Peter the Great stayed and had his headquarters established here in 1705 and 1709. After S≈Çuszko's death the palace was owned by the Puzyna princely family (of Rurikid stock) since 1727 and by the Potocki family since 1745. The Piarist monks bought the palace in 1756 and established a collegiate and a printing house. Later it was bought by Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Ogi≈Ñski in 1766 and reconstructed by Pietro Rossi. The palace was confiscated by the tsarist government in 1794 and transformed into an apartment house. It housed a brewery of Dominik Zajkowski from 1803 until 1831 when the palace was taken by tsarist military. The building was rearranged, the floors were redivided into four, and the palace served as a military prison since 1872. The rich original interior and exterior of the palace have not survived. Nowadays the palace houses the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre. In the meantime the outhouses are undergoing the restoration and the main palace is planned to come next. The palace is planned to regain its original two main floors layout and original Baroque style windows.

This psychological thriller describes moral corruption in a conservative religious sect which shares some of the characteristics of the LDS Church. Father of lies is written from three perspectives: from Provost Fochs, from his analyst Dr Alexander Feshtig and from the text of letters exchanged between Feshtig and his superiors in the church hierarchy. Plot Eldon Fochs is a 38-year-old accountant and lay provost. He is happily married with four children. Feshtig works as a therapist in an Institute of Psychoanalysis funded and controlled by the church. Fochs is persuaded to go to Feshtig by his wife, who has a growing suspicion that her husband harbours dark secrets. Fochs slowly reveals the contents of his dreams and his \\"disturbing thoughts\\" about children to Feshtig. He reveals two dreams; one when he strangles and dismembers a girl and another of a 12-year-old boy. In the dream, the boy comes into his office and Fochs brutally sodomises him. He frightens the boy with threats and forces him to admit to having been molested by an uncle, something that never happened. Fochs claims that in his dream he was guided by God. In the chapters where Fochs is in the first person, he describes how he assaulted and murdered a 14-year-old girl. He also describes his ecclesiastical superior confronting him with allegations from two mothers that he has molested their boys. He denies the allegations, and his superiors choose to believe him. Feshtig meets with one of the mothers and starts to counsel her son Nathan Mears, and he gradually uncovers the extent of the damage that Fochs has done to the young boy. As the abuse allegations reach the media, the pressure on the church mounts, but it does everything to protect itself and its reputation, going as far as to excommunicate the two mothers. The pressure on Fochs from his wife is more difficult to answer as she presses him on what he was doing the night the girl was murdered. Eventually he rams his car into a tree, having surreptitiously unclipped his wife‚Äôs seat belt. She is thrown through the window and killed. Feshtig reveals his conclusions to the police, but their DNA tests are inconclusive. Protected by the church, Fochs still contrives to spend time alone with young boys in order to molest them. He is eventually transferred to a teaching position in another city, free to carry on his abuse. As the novel ends, having assaulted his children‚Äôs babysitter, Fochs sinks to further level of depravity and starts a cycle of incest with his eldest daughter.

Family and early life Maurice was born in Southwark, London in 1841, the eldest son of Rev. Frederick Denison Maurice, an Anglican priest, theologian and author. He published several volumes on his father's life in 1884. He was educated at the Royal India Military College, Addiscombe, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and entered the Royal Artillery in 1861. Career Maurice served as private secretary to Sir Garnet Wolseley in the Ashanti Campaign of 1873‚Äì1874; in the Zulu War in 1880; was deputy assistant adjutant general of the Egyptian expedition in 1882; and was brevetted colonel in 1885. In 1885‚Äì1892 he was professor of military history at the Staff College, Camberley, and in 1895 was promoted to major general. Later in his career he was commander of the Woolwich District until September 1902. In 1905, Maurice was part of a team which went to Berlin to negotiate with the Germans on the problems of the Navy estimates and the escalating threat posed to the Empire. In January 1906, news was leaked to The Times that implicated him in the leaking of war material purchases, which he had discussed.Sir Edward Grey letter to Lascelles, F.O. 371/76 (no. 53), dated 31 January 1906; Owen, Hidden, p. 63.

Nithiin, Sadha, and Gopichand starred in the lead roles and music was composed by R. P. Patnaik. The film was commercially successful and a trendsetter. It was remade by M. Raja in Tamil with the same title in 2003. Plot In a village, the parents of first cousins Sujatha and Raghu decide that the children will marry one another when they grow up. Raghu is seen to be arrogant and negatively shaded since young. He smokes and steals money from his father to gamble. Once when Raghu attacks Sujatha's classmate when he helps her, Sujatha breaks all bonds with Raghu. When Raghu's family moves to another village, Sujatha and Raghu do not even say goodbye to each other. Meanwhile, Raghu's father gifts Sujatha with silver anklets and requests her to never remove them, to which she obliges. Several years pass by. Raghu and Sujatha are very distanced. Sujatha grows up to be a beautiful teenage girl whereas Raghu becomes a rogue and a womanizer. Every time his mother speaks of Sujatha, he feels disgusted. He goes to the extent of sleeping with his servant. Meanwhile, Sujatha goes to college where she meets Venkat. Venkat is from an extremely poor family and does small jobs to support his single mother, and pay the money lender. He has a decent group of friends and they are classmates with Sujatha. Venkat has an instant crush on Sujatha, which Sujatha does not reciprocate. Venkat asks Sujatha to come to the temple festival, to which she refuses. But in the end, Sujatha comes, indicating that she is in love with Venkat. Venkat and Sujatha start dating and communicate with each other on the train by writing to each other on the blackboard at the side of the train. Once, when building up the courage to board the same compartment in the train as Venkat, Sujatha is spotted by the family astrologer. She goes home scared and as she had expected, the astrologer had told Sujatha's father. Her father tells her that she would be married to Raghu just as was decided years ago. Sujatha protests, but her father stays firm. This results in Sujatha dropping out of college and staying at home. Raghu comes for the engagement reluctantly (still thinking of their childhood encounter), but instantly falls for her the moment he sees her. He warns Sujatha that she would never go away and marry him in the end. They both are engaged. Sujatha has a younger sister Kalyani, who turns out to be the messenger between her and Venkat. She gives a message to Venkat to meet Sujatha at the temple. The whole family goes to the temple after the engagement and there Sujatha sees Venkat waiting for her. She is spotted talking to Venkat by Raghu and his gang and they mercilessly beat him up. Traumatized, Sujatha runs to her father, but Raghu indirectly warns her family that things would turn out wrong if Venkat is seen anywhere near Sujatha. He then mysteriously comes into Raghu's home and writes that he would be the one marrying Sujatha in the end, in blood, triggering Raghu. Fearing that Venkat would come and take Sujatha away, Raghu sends his men to Venkat's house. They trash the whole house and the things inside, sparing his mother. His mother tells Venkat's friends that he should come back with Sujatha and if he does not, she herself would kill him. Same thing happens in Sujatha's home on their wedding day he writes he will take Sujatha at 7:00. Raghu in a rush, asks the family to hurry and complete the wedding. Sujatha goes into the room to change but in reality, she is waiting for Venkat, after seeing his message on the wall. Raghu comes and breaks open the door and at the same time, Venkat comes through the roof and rescues Sujatha. Angered and defeated, Raghu goes after the couple and a chase ensues which results in Venkat getting wounded by Raghu. The couple and Venkat's friend who helped them, escape in the train with the help of the conductor. But Raghu enters the train with his men and the couple escape to the roof, where they are cornered. To save themselves, they jump off the train and roll down to a forest. To their shock, Raghu and his men come there as well. After gaining confidence from Sujatha, he fights with Raghu. Raghu is defeated in a face-to-face combat with Venkat, and Venkat marries Sujatha.

This term is used occasionally and usually refers to blood leukocytes (which are not fixed and organized in solid tissue) in particular mononuclear phagocytes. Frequently, the term refers to circulating macrophages and has been used also for stationary macrophages fixed in tissues (histiocytes), which are sometimes referred to as \\"resting wandering cells\\". Connective Tissue Cells Connective tissue cells are typically divided into two types, fixed cells and wandering cells. Fibrocytes, or fibroblasts and fat cells(adipocytes) are fixed cells, where as macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and mast cells are wandering cells. Fibrocytes are the most common cell type in connective tissues. If fibrocytes are stimulated by damage to the surrounding tissue, the fibrocyte is altered into a fibroblast. The fibroblasts contain organelles that are necessary for the synthesis and excretion of proteins needed to repair the tissue damage. Fibrocytes usually do not leave the connective tissue. Reticular cells are usually larger than fibrocytes. Reticular cells are the fibrocytes of reticular connective tissue and form a network of reticular fibers. Adipocytes are fat cells that are fixed cells in loose connective tissue. Their main function is the storage of lipid. Macrophages arise from monocytes. Monocytes originate in the bone marrow upon which they are released into the blood stream. They are mobile and leave the blood stream to enter connective tissues where they differentiate into macrophages. The fibroblasts are the most important in the connective tissue. Fibroblasts manufacture and maintain the extracellular material. They migrate throughout the extracellular matrix to wherever they are needed. Adipocytes are cells that are very efficient at storing energy in the form of triglycerides.Nautica2.2Liquid Types of Cells Macrophages: Supported by a network of connective tissue. Understood as the Reticuloendothelial System, the RES allows microglial differential in the CNS, pulmonary alveolar macrophages, tissue histiocytes, Kupffler Hepatic macrophages, Glomerular Mesangial Proliferation and unnamed Splenic expression of wandering macrophages. Sharing of iron storage remains an essential mystery. Lymphocytes: These are cells responsible for immune responses that circulate in the blood. Normally, only small numbers are found in the CTs throughout the body. The number increases dramatically at certain sites of tissue inflammation. They are also very numerous in the lamina propria of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, where they are involved in immunosurveillance. The lamina propria is a layer of loose CT lying immediately beneath the epithelium. Plasma cells: Plasma cells are derived from B-lymphocytes and produce antibodies against a specific antigen. They have a limited migratory ability and a short life. Neutrophils: Neutrophils are white blood cells that act as phagocytes in the early stages of acute inflammation. Eosinophils: Eosinophils are white blood cells that are found in the lamina propria of the GI tract, and at sites of allergic reaction and parasitic infection. Basophils: Basophils are white blood cells that are similar to mast cells in having vasoactive agents released in response to an allergen. Monocytes: Monocytes are white blood cells that will give rise to all the phagocytes of the mononuclear phagocytic system (see Ross et al., pg. 110, and Table 5.4, pg. 112). In CT, they give rise to macrophages (histiocytes). Characteristics Wandering Cells are probably amoeboid when alive but after fixations they are seen to possess a distinct nucleus. These cells are regarded as a special type of blood cell. The cells were found to take up iron saccharate, which had been injected into the haemocoele. The cell's cytoplasm contains a variety of inclusions and characteristically, a well-markedeosinophile area. The wandering cells of nudibranchs are excretory taking up effete matter from the harmocoele and discharging it into the lumen of the gut. Lymphocytes Lymphocytes are just one group of cells that function as part of the immune system. More of this group travel around the lymphatic system than in the blood network. Two types of lymphocytes are present in the bloodstream, which are the B cells and the T cells. B cells are wandering cells that are antibody factories. They are capable of producing molecules that can recognize and bond to specific types of molecules present in infectious organisms or substances that the body identifies as foreign. Every individual B cell makes only one particular type of antibody, specific to only one type of foreign substance. For example, where one cell produces antibody against one of the many viral causes of a cold, another cell's antibodies will ignore the presence of the same virus completely. Normally, the body contains many different B cells, specialized for a specific invader, but only has low levels of each type circulating. When an invader manages to break past other defenses, like the skin or digestive tract into the body, then the circulating B cells that target that particular foreigner multiply up and produce more antibody. Special forms of B cell called plasma cells produce antibodies; little versions of the specialized B cells, called memory B cells, remain stored in lymph glands prepared for the next invasion by the foreigner. Although the products of B cells, the antibodies, stick onto their target invader, they most often do not kill the invader. This job falls to other types of lymphocytes called T cells. There are three different forms of T cells, which are the Helper T cells, the Killer T cells, and the Suppressor T cells.

This is a process naturally regulated in the body and tends to be very efficient in a healthy CNS. The process creates a thinner myelin sheath than normal, but it helps to protect the axon from further damage, from overall degeneration, and proves to increase conductance once again. The processes underlying remyelination are under investigation in the hope of finding treatments for Demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.  Function  Remyelination is activated and regulated by a variety of factors surrounding lesion sites that control the migration and differentiation of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells. Remyelination looks different from developmental myelination in the structure of the myelin formed. Reasons for this are unclear, but proper function of the axon is restored regardless. Perhaps of most interest are the inhibition and promotion factors of this physiological process. One way this process can be traced is by following different protein activation sequences which have shown just how quickly remyelination begins after injury (within a few of days).  Characteristics of remyelinated axons  The most notable evidence that remyelination has taken place on an axon is its thin myelin sheath created by an oligodendrocyte, though the reason why the new myelin sheath is thinner remains unclear. This can be quantified in the g-ratio, the ratio between the diameter of the axon itself to the outer diameter of the myelinated fiber. Remyelinated axons tend to have values closer to 1, indicating a thinner myelin sheath than those myelinated naturally. The g-ratio differences are less apparent on smaller axons. Myelin Sheaths in the CNS. The thinner myelin not only restores protection of the axon from degradation, but also restores a faster conduction velocity. The conduction velocity, however, is not as strong as naturally myelinated axons and the Nodes of Ranvier are inclined to be wider which results in less coverage in the axon by myelin than what is natural.  OPC involvement  Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells, or OPC's, are the main cells responsible for the remyelination of demyelinated axons. There are two physiological changes that must occur to OPC's for remyelination to occur. Once a signal is sent that remyelination is needed, OPC's will first migrate to damaged axon. This process may be signaled or enhanced by microglia or astrocytes at the injured axon site that stimulate migratory OPC pathways From there the cells must differentiate from being progenitors to being pre- oligodendrocytes, then premyelinating oligodendrocytes, and finally mature oligodendrocytes. These oligodendrocytes can then wrap damaged axons with new myelin sheaths. This process of differentiation through several phases has many involved and direct pathways and factors necessary for the completion of this process. It is easy to completely stop remyelination with the failure of a number of pathways.  Propagation factors  One of the difficulties of studying remyelination is the variety of factors that play a role in differentiating oligodendrocyte progenitors. While some factors promote and others inhibit, still some factors that are known to be involved are yet not understood enough to know whether it promotes, inhibits, or does both. Many factors are poorly understood and subject to much change as research is done. Cytokines and chemokines Cytokines mediate inflammatory responses that promote pathogen and debris clearance so that further tissue damage is avoided. Too much can mean cell death but failure to propagate cytokines at all in remyelination results in a lack of debris clearance at a damaged axon site; this buildup of myelin and oligodendrocyte debris has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells. Specifically, cytokines promote TNFR2 and eventually TNF-alpha which plays a key role in OPC differentiation. It has also been shown that chemokines are involved in guiding immune cells to sites of axon lesions to facilitate inflammation and debris clearance as well as possibly guiding OPCs migration to lesion sites. So then, chemokines are directly involved with both migration and differentiation of OPCs. The specific chemokines involved with each of these two processes is known: CXCL12 is related to migration and differentiation is increased with an increase in CXCR7 and a decrease in CXCR4. In certain demyelinating diseases CXCL12 has been shown to be decreased, possibly playing a role in demyelination failure. Still much is to be researched in this field, as certain chemokines like CXCR2 plays a role in inflammation and repair but in an unknown manner over much controversy. Signaling pathways LINGO1, a cell receptor, has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of remyelination. It is thought to inhibit not only axon regeneration but also regulate oligodendrocyte maturation by inhibiting OPC differentiation. Animal studies suggest that when a LINGO1 is inhibited, OPC differentiation and thus remyelination can be promoted at demyelinated sites. LINGO1 gene expression is also known to activate RhoA which may also play a part in inhibition. Myelin debris build up might be responsible for the promotion of the LINGO1 signalling and overall inhibition. The Notch-1 receptor pathway is another pathway that inhibits the differentiation of OPCs. When the ligands Jagged1 and Delta, produced by axons, neurons, and astrocytes, are stimulated and bind to the membrane, oligodendrocyte maturation is inhibited. This pathway may also be facilitating migration despite its differentiation inhibition. In some experiments, altering the pathway so that differentiation is increased caused a decrease in the proliferation of OPCs. There may be other ligands that have either promoting or inhibiting effects when attached to the Notch-1 receptor. The Wnt-Œ≤-Catelin pathway has been shown to also inhibit remyelination when it is dysregulated in the body. Demyelinating diseases have been shown to cause this dysregulation. Possible genes involved inside this pathway are TCF4 and OLIG2 which are both expressed in high amounts in areas where remyelination has failed from demyelinating diseases. Transcription factors Gene expression may be the most important factor in understanding remyelination and can hold the key to understanding how to treat demyelinating diseases. OLIG1 has been shown to be critical in developmental myelination and may also be important in remyelination. OLIG2 and TRF4 have also been shown to be important especially in the Wnt-Œ≤-Catenin Pathway, most likely in inhibiting remyelination. NKX2-2 is a gene coding for a protein that may increase the number of OPCs in low amounts, possibly working with OLIG2 in some way to differentiate OPCs to mature oligodendrocytes. As more genes involved in remyelination are found and cross linked more will be understood about promotion and inhibition. Androgen receptor (AR) and testosterone In a mouse model, it has been shown that testosterone, acting through the AR, is important in remyelination by oligodendrocytes. Those same authors note that the AR evolved from a duplicated gene coincidentally with the development of myelin in jawed vertebrates. Other factors It is known that as age increases there's a decrease in the efficiency (both the speed and magnitude) of remyelination at demyelinated axons. This is probably linked with down regulation of certain expressed genes with increased age. The research of this is particularly important with the elderly whose myelin and axons are more prone to be degenerated in the CNS. Class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3s), originally identified as axon guidance molecules, play a role in remyelination. For instance, SEMA3s modulate the recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and their differentiation into oligodendrocytes. In addition, SEMA3a is known to repel Schwann cells. Growth Factors are active polypeptides that control differentiation and biological growth in responsive cells. They have been shown to have a prominent role. Due to the wide variety of these factors it is difficult to study specifically but understanding can be big in treating demyelinating diseases. Some of the factors being researched are EGF (which is known to enhance myelination), IGF-1, PDGF, and FGF Toll-Like receptors are also involved in remyelination, most likely inhibiting remyelination and OPC differentiation. There are a variety of types of these receptors, but a majority of them tend to increase, especially in the chronic stages of demyelinating diseases, suggesting that they may be involved with remyelination failure. MicroRNA is not well understood but may play a minor or major role in remyelination. MicroRNA may have a role in reduction of CD47 which promotes phagocytosis of myelin. Certain microRNAs have been shown to promote OPC differentiation by their involvement and maintenance of genes that keep OPCs undifferentiated.  Disease treatment  Understanding completely the inhibiting and promoting factors of OPCs seems to be the key in battling demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis that cause remyelination to fail. Not only are the inhibition factors being looked at as ways to stop remyelination failure, but promotion factors are being looked at to facilitate remyelination in the face of inhibited processes. Stem cell research is also ongoing in seeing how to differentiate neural stem cells into mature oligodendrocytes that will activate at demyelinated sites. Looking at the known factors of developmental myelination may also translate well into remyelination promotion.  Multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is the most prominent of the demyelinating diseases, affecting at least 30 in 100000 people worldwide on average. The ratio is much higher than that in certain areas of the world. While the early stages of multiple sclerosis are less discernible, the chronic stages can greatly reduce an individual's quality of life by limiting motor function. The demyelinating disease attacks the myelin of axons in the central nervous system through autoimmune defects. While remyelination is very efficient in the early stages of multiple sclerosis, it causes remyelination to fail in the more chronic stages. As axons are left bare, without myelin, their conduction velocity goes down due to a lack in increased potential between the Nodes of Ranvier. Not only does conduction go down, but a naked axon is also much more likely to degrade completely, resulting in complete loss of function for certain motor functions. The loss of axons because of lack of protection is what makes MS so debilitating. Degradation is considered to be worse than the effects of demyelination. Once an axon is degenerated, it cannot regenerate like myelin, thus making research to promote remyelination that much more important. MS is more severe in some people than others, most likely from their family genetics and the way that genes are expressed within them. The overall cause for multiple sclerosis itself is completely unknown. Altering important pathways in OPC differentiation such as Notch-1, Wnt, and LINGO1 may prove to be a possible treatment for this disease. Using antibodies to halt or promote certain parts of these pathways could be possible therapies to help increase OPC differentiation. As pathways are better understood, different parts of the pathways can be singled out as possible therapeutic areas to promote remyelination. The results of CCMR-One, a clinical trial of the effects of bexarotene on patients with multiple sclerosis operated by the University of Cambridge, have shown that the drug can cause remyelination, but will not lead to the drug being used as a therapy, due to its risk profile.  Future research  Still much is not understood concerning remyelination. New pathways are being discovered constantly in the areas of gene regulation, antibody use as antagonists, and promotion of stem cells to differentiate. There are many regulation factors, such as Lingo-1, Olig-1, Id2, Id4, Hes5, and Sox6, that are not very well understood in their role that may hold the key to developing new treatments for demyelinating diseases. One of the biggest difficulties of studying demyelinating diseases and thus remyelination is that it takes place in the central nervous system. Studying remyelination most thoroughly would involve unethical and invasive experiments and observation on the human brain and spinal cord. Because of this, scientists are limited to studying patients with demylinating diseases after they have died. It is nearly impossible to discern what exactly happened through the progress of the diseased person because most persons die in the chronic stages of their demyelinating disease. The other method of studying demyelinating diseases is using animals. Specifically, rats and mice are commonly used to investigate remyelination. The most commonly employed models rely on toxins that are used to generate focal or generalised demyelination in the CNS. Unlike in MS-mimmicking animal models, such as Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE, toxin models allow for precisely controlled demyelination. EAE is induced by immunologically sensitising animals to myelin components. Although EAE is not the same as MS, it reproduces a similar environment and many of the same effects.

It is the second sequel to Advise and Consent, for which Drury was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1960. Capable of Honor examines the role that journalists play during a US presidential campaign. Advise and Consent and its sequels had been out of print for almost 15 years until WordFire Press reissued them in paperback and e-book format in 2014. Plot summary In the novel, Harley Hudson, the affable but inept Vice President from Advise and Consent, is now president and seeking a term of his own against a backdrop of Soviet- instigated war, as the Soviet Union backs rebel governments in Panama and in the fictitious African republic of Gorotoland. Hudson responds with U.S. troops in both countries, and the conflicts soon bog down. The election season soon turns on these foreign policy questions, with the media and others seeking a peace candidate ‚Äî and finding it in the popular but weak-willed Governor Ted Jason of California. Having announced his candidacy late, Hudson announces an open contest for the Vice Presidential nomination, in which Secretary of State Orrin Knox, who supports Hudson's policies, opposes Jason. The media, who had supported Jason heavily when it looked like it would be a Knox-Jason race for the Presidential nomination, continues its effort for a Jason victory by any means they can. At the convention in San Francisco, extreme elements of the Left and Right combine to support Jason, and there are several violent incidents, including one in which Knox's daughter-in-law is brutally attacked. When it becomes clear that the convention is split down the middle in fights over the platform, Jason challenges Hudson for the Majority Party's nomination (the novels never use the proper names \\"Republican\\" or \\"Democrat\\" but the descriptions of Majority Party corresponds strongly to the Democrats of the 1960s). The media, meantime, spins merrily away, filtering what the country is allowed to see and hear from San Francisco. Ceil Jason, the Governor's wife, leaves him when her husband's lack of principle and willingness to tolerate the violence sinks in to her. Hudson wins narrowly, and Jason expects the Vice Presidential nomination since he commands the support of almost half the convention. Hudson seems amenable, and places Jason on the dais as he makes his acceptance speech. Hudson humiliates Jason by making it clear that he considers Jason a panderer, and states he will accept Knox, and only Knox, as his running mate. The convention duly nominates Knox, but almost half its delegates walk out, to the pleasure of the media commentators, who predict a third-party convention from among the disaffected delegates.

Architecture and restoration Also known as the \\"marble church\\", it is one of the best examples of the early Venetian Renaissance including colored marble, a false colonnade on the exterior walls (pilasters), and a semicircular pediment. The organisation Save Venice Inc. restored the church over a period of seven years, from 1990 to 1997 (after several years of preliminary research). The treatments focussed on the marble sheeting and sculptural decoration of both the exterior and interior of the church. The marble cladding contained 14 percent of salts, and was on the point of bursting, when restorers began the desalination and cleaning process. All marble cladding was removed, and cleaned in stainless steel tanks, in a solution of distilled water. Additionally, the campaign worked in the coffered ceiling, which was made up of fifty-two wooden panels depicting saints and prophets. The cleaning led to the rediscovery of frescoes of sibyls on the spandrels of the ceiling. Nearly every part of the church was examined and treated, including the intarsia doors in the presbytery, the bronze statues and candelabra of the high altar, and the wooden panel of the Madonna from which the church got its name. The restoration was calculated to cost 1 million dollars, the final cost was 4 million dollars. The main altar is reached by a series of steps. The circular facade windows recall Donato Bramante's churches in Milan. History Built between 1481 and 1489 by Pietro Lombardo to house a miraculous icon of the Virgin Mary. The plans for the church were expanded in 1484 to include the construction of a new convent for nuns of St. Clare to the east. The convent was connected to the gallery of the church by an enclosed walkway that was later destroyed. The interior. The interior is enclosed by a wide barrel vault, with a single nave. The nave is dominated by an ornamental marble stair rising between two pulpits, with statues by Tullio Lombardo, Alessandro Vittoria and Niccol√≤ di Pietro. The vaulted ceiling is divided into fifty coffers decorated with paintings of prophets, a work by Girolamo Pennacchi's contemporaries, Vincenzo dalle Destre and Lattanzio da Rimini.

The organization is maintained and run by Ji≈ô√≠ Gruntor√°d and includes more than 29,200 monographs and periodicals, about 2,900 reference resources, and over 5,000 audiovisual materials. Overview Location: Libri Prohibiti is located on the third floor of Senovazne namesti 2, Prague 1, Czech Republic Hours: Monday - Thursday, 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. (except holidays and school vacations) The Libri Prohibiti is free to all visitors. The library houses a reading room that can accommodate eighteen people and averages approximately ten visitors per day. Reference services are provided in person, via email, and over the telephone. The collections are non-circulating due to the uniqueness and frailty of the items. The staff consists of the director - Ji≈ô√≠ Gruntor√°d, a part-time Video and Audio Archivist, a part-time Magazine Archivist, and several unpaid volunteers and library and information science students from the nearby Charles University and the Josef ≈†kvoreck√Ω private college. As of the 2009 Annual Report, the Libri Prohibiti‚Äôs main goals are to ‚Äúaccumulate the most complete and highest quality collection of‚Ä¶materials which were created by the Czech and Slovak exile‚Äù and ‚Äúcompletely catalog these collections by computer and to make the results accessible for the purpose of further research, both in [its] computer network and in the form of book and periodical publications‚Äù. A majority of the library‚Äôs 2009 income is acquired through government grants and individual sponsors. To aid in funding, the Libri Prohibiti constantly seeks grants from the Ministries of Culture and Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. Since government funding is limited, the library depends on the generosity of individual donors for much of its income. History of Samizdat in Czechoslovakia When Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule in the mid- to late-twentieth century, over 400 writers and journalists were prohibited from publishing and distributing any of their works. Some writers, such as V√°clav Havel, were persecuted and sentenced to prison if they did not comply with these regulations. During this time many different types of performers, entertainers, and various other creators were persecuted for and banned from performing or creating their specific art forms. It was almost impossible for these persecuted individuals to find any kind of employment after this. In defiance of these regulations, some banned authors began writing samizdat articles and distributing them secretly in Czechoslovakia and abroad. In order to produce multiple copies of their works, they used carbon paper to produce up to fifteen copies at once. Other methods of copying included cyclostyle, spirit duplicator, photocopying, and xerography. The materials were secretly distributed among dissidents and sometimes smuggled abroad. All of these actions were very dangerous and those caught faced imprisonment or exile. During this time, Ji≈ô√≠ Gruntor√°d, the current caretaker of the Libri Prohibiti, was imprisoned for four years for distributing samizdat literature. In addition to dissident articles, many popular books were banned and subsequently distributed as samizdats. Some of the most famous works include George Orwell‚Äôs Nineteen Eighty-Four and J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Lord of the Rings, both of which are held at the Libri Prohibiti. History of the Libri Prohibiti On October 22, 1990, the Libri Prohibiti opened with help from different organizations including the Czechoslovak Charter 77 and the President of the Czech Republic. The original location was on Podskalska Street, and later moved to its current location at Senovazne namesti 2. The collection began with around 2,000 monographs and magazines that were acquired by Jiri Gruntorad during the years of ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù in the Czech Republic. Since then, the collection has continued to grow and expand with the help and support of government grants and generous donors. The Society of Libri Prohibiti was formed on April 24, 1991 to help the library establish itself as a legal entity. The society was officially established after registering with the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic. The primary goal of the society is to help the Libri Prohibiti continue operating and acquiring new materials for its collections. Many of the founding members of this society were significant and established authors, former government and academic leaders and employees, and teachers and other prominent members of the community. Among some of the most prominent founders of the society were V√°clav Havel, Ivan Klima, and Jan Vladislav. Today there are over 180 members of the Society of Libri Prohibiti. The society invites any interested people to join if they would like to contribute or help the Libri Prohibiti in any way.

The show ran for nine years between 1998 and 2007, looking at spiritual and moral issues. Over the years it had numerous presenters, and its final presenter was Gloria Hunniford. Format The programme had a magazine format, with guests of all backgrounds talking about various ethical, spiritual and cultural issues. The programme also featured phone-ins, email and text readouts. Commonly a celebrity guest would be interviewed about their career with a particular focus on religious belief or spirituality; some later guests included Jermaine Jackson, Al Green, Alexei Sayle and Vic Reeves. Heaven and Earth was notably different from traditional \\"God slot\\" (Sunday morning/afternoon) programming in that it concentrated on a wide range of beliefs rather than just Christianity ‚Äî for example, features on the ethics of halal meat or \\"New Age\\" concepts of spirituality. It included prominent figures from the Church and Islamic, Jewish, Hindu and secular communities and would also contain reports on topical religious issues, with notable reporters including Toyah Willcox, John Walters, Ed Stourton, Myleene Klass, Kate Silverton and Kate Gerbeau. Occasionally there were special programmes such as that on 7 September 2003 covering three different types of beliefs: theist, New Age followers and atheists or agnostics. A specially commissioned poll was produced on issues raised. Productions Heaven and Earth was made by the BBC's in-house Religion and Ethics department and was broadcast live from a former news studio at the BBC in Oxford Road, Manchester. Later on, as part of a re-launch, the show moved to ITV's Granada Studios. Cancellation The BBC announced in the spring of 2007 that they would be cancelling the show in autumn after a run of nine years and replacing it for a 12-month period with commissions made by two independent production companies. On 2 September 2007, Heaven & Earth had its final show; The Proclaimers and Beth Neilsen Chapman were the final musical guests.

It is narrated by 20 different characters and tells the story of a voyage to look for the Garden of Eden in Tasmania and the rapid decline of that island‚Äôs indigenous population of Aboriginal Tasmanians. Plot summary In 1857, after their attempts to smuggle contraband goods land them with a heavy fine from the British Customs, Captain Illiam Quillian Kewley and his crew of Manx sailors are forced to offer their ship for charter. The vessel is quickly hired by a party of Englishmen headed by an eccentric Vicar, the Reverend Geoffrey Wilson, who believes that the Garden of Eden is located in Tasmania and wants to mount an expedition there to find it. However, unbeknownst to the clergyman, one of his fellow travellers has an entirely different reason for journeying to the island. Dr Thomas Potter is a renowned surgeon who is developing a thesis on the races of man and hopes to find some interesting specimens there. Running parallel with this story, but starting some 30 or so years earlier, are the recollections of Peevay, one of Tasmania's natives, who describes the devastating impact the white settlers had on his people, and the Aboriginal people' struggle to adapt to the cultural changes which were forced on them. Many of the chapters alternate between the two different time periods, but when the Manx ship eventually docks in Tasmania, both strands of the story are brought together for the book's conclusion.

This order was granted to both native Hawaiians and foreigners for superlative service to the monarch and to the kingdom. It was last conferred by Queen Lili ªuokalani on 1 August 1892; in 1893, the Order became abeyant. In the duration the Order, it was granted 239 times by King KalƒÅkaua I, and 15 times by his sister Queen Lili ªuokalani. Number of awards in the history of the Order: * Knights Grand Cross - 38 recipients * Grand Officer Star - 49 recipients * Commander Cross - 95 recipientsAbolished 11 September 1885 * Companion Cross - 73 recipients Annuity Recipients of the Order who were residents in the Hawaiian islands received a yearly salary depending upon their grade: $150 for the Knights Grand Cross, $125 for the Grand Officer Star, $100 for the Commander Cross and $50 for the Knight. Grand Council The Grand Council of Order, which consists of the Order's Cavaliers resident on the Hawaiian islands, convened yearly on 12 February. Members absent from the annual meeting and without a written message stating as such without a valid reason, were penalized $20. Of all the Royal Hawaiian Orders, only this one and the Royal Order of Kamehameha I gathered at regular intervals. Insignia of the Order The badge of the order is a Maltese cross in gold or silver with Prussian blue and white enamel, surmounted by a Hawaiian crown. The arms of the cross have a border strip of white enamel, the center being blue - separated by a thin band of gold or silver. A gold or silver wreath and a p≈´lo ªulo ªu (kapu sticks - ball and stick insignia) is found between the arms connecting them. On the cross is a blue and white enamel locket. On a white strip, the inscription KALAKAUA FEBRUARY 12 1874 circles a kƒÅhili (feathered standard of royalty) on a background of blue. The reverse comprises a locket of blue and white. At the center of the locket is the date 1874, surrounded by the inscription KEOLA (eternal life) - both in gold. Knights Grand Cross with Collar: The insignia are a collar chain and a breast star. The collar chain is composed of alternating monograms \\"K.I.K.\\" and kahili of red and yellow enamel. The central component of the chain, from which is hung the badge of the Order, is the monogram \\"K.I.K.\\" surrounded by a gold wreath.

W.M. Smith-Dorrien (died 1924), Vicar of Crediton Sir William Peryam (15349 October 1604) of Little Fulford, near Crediton in Devon, was an English judge who, in 1593, rose to the position of Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I. Origins Peryam was born in Exeter, the eldest son of John Peryam, twice mayor of Exeter, and his wife Elizabeth, a daughter and co-heir of Robert Hone of Ottery. The year of Peryam's birth is known to history but, as was common in the 16th century, the day and month went unrecorded. Through his mother's sister, Joan Bodley n√©e Hone, Peryam was cousin to Sir Thomas Bodley. Like the Bodleys, the Peryams were early adherents of Protestantism and were also threatened in the time of Marian persecutions. Under Queen Elizabeth however, the family thrived, with William eventually achieving eminence in law and his younger brother John Peryam (1541 ‚Äì c. 1618), MP, elected to Parliament four times (Barnstaple 1584, Bossiney 1586, Exeter 1589 and 1593) and becoming Mayor of Exeter. The lawyer and politician William Hakewill and the clergyman and author George Hakewill were his nephews.Sons of his sister, Thomazin Peryam: Sheila Doyle, ‚ÄòHakewill, William (bap. 1574, d. 1655)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Education Young William was first educated in Exeter and then at Exeter College, Oxford where on 25 April 1551 he was elected fellow. He resigned his fellowship some months later and went to London where he eventually studied law at the Middle Temple, being called to the bar in 1565. Career A slight setback in his career occurred in 1568 when, after having been summoned to Ireland by Sir Peter Carew to help him prosecute an ultimately successful claim to an Irish barony, Peryam received an unexpected appointment as judge under the prospective President of Munster, Sir John Pollard. By writing to Sir William Cecil and earnestly petitioning the Privy Council, mentioning his wife and children and delicate state of health, Peryam seems to have been able to avoid the transfer to Ireland altogether. Thereafter, his rise through the legal ranks was steady: in 1575 he became serjeant-at-law for the Michaelmas term, and on 13 February 1581, a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. His highest office came in January 1593, when he was knighted and promoted to Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Of his knighthood Prince wrote as follows: \\"Queen Elizabeth of blessed memory, as a signal testimony of her favour and his worth, was pleased to confer upon him the honour of knighthood, but not before he had been twelve years a judge, so cautious was that wise princess in conferring titles, lest they should become cheap and contemptible\\".

The text inscribed on a tablet within a strapwork surround above the effigy is as follows: :Heere lyeth the body of Sr. William Peryam, knight, who in AD 1579 was made one of the justices of the Court of Comon Pleas & from thence in AD 1592 was called to bee Lord Cheefe Baron of the Exchequer. He married first Margery daughter & heir of Jo(hn) Holcott of Berk(shire) Esqr. widow of Richadr(sic) Hutchenson of Yorksheire Esqr.; secondly Anne daughter of John Parker of Devon Esqr.; lastly Elizabeth daughter of Sr. Nic(holas) Bacon knig.

Dormit non est mortuus (he sleeps, he is not dead) Armorials Heraldic achievement of Sir William Peryam (died 1604) atop his monument in Crediton Church The heraldic achievement on top of the monument to Sir William Peryam in Crediton Church show the following: Quarterly, 1st & 4th: Gules, a chevron engrailed between three leopards' faces or (Peryam modern, formerly Branch); 2nd: Argent, a chevron between three pears sable(?) (Peryam ancient); 3rd: Argent, two bars wavy between three billets sable (Hone of Ottery)Burke's General Armory, 1884. The arms of a chevron engrailed between three leopards' faces were according to Prince's \\"Worthies of Devon\\" (1710) originally the arms of the family of Branch, \\"whose heir was married to Periam, of which family the ancient arms were argent, a chevron between four (sic) pears sable\\". These ancient arms of Peryham appear therefore to be canting arms playing on the Latin pirum (pear) and its derivative \\"perry\\" the drink made from pears. It would appear therefore that one of the younger sons of this marriage, the ancestor of Sir William, was required to adopt the arms of his mother's family, expired in the male line, in lieu of his paternal arms in order to inherit his maternal lands. Such cases were very common, from the earliest times.See e.g. the 1347 lawsuit of Warbleton v. Gorges The crest of Peryham is: Two arms gules, issuing out of a crown or, holding in the hands proper a leopard's face of the second.Prince, Worthies of Devon Notes References * External links *Crediton parish church web-site, images of the Peryam Monument & biography Further reading *Hasler, R.W.

Plot Spencer Griffith is a shy boy in seventh grade. He has a crush on a schoolmate named Michelle. His life changes one night when a mysterious meteorite crashes into a nearby junkyard. Sneaking out of his house to investigate the site, he discovers the meteorite to actually be a small rocket carrying a \\"Cyborsuit.\\", a prototype exoskeletal-suit with AI (short for Artificial intelligence) from another galaxy. He decides to try it on and melds with it, but requires some time to adjust to the experience, including the new speed and strength. He then tests out many of the suit's primary functions and abilities, and decides to call it \\"Cy\\". He proceeds to go around town doing whatever he wants, starting with getting back at a bully from school named Turbo, then saving Michelle and her friends from a damaged Rock-O-Plane and ordering food from a fast-food restaurant drive-thru. He also endures the hilarious antics of trashing part of his house after getting his head stuck inside of the refrigerator, discovering the unappealing way that the suit will allow for him to eat his ordered drive-thru food, and finding a way to pee when Cy won't let him out to do it. During this time, Earth is visited by a Broodwarrior, a member of an alien race of insectoids. They are currently waging a war against the suit's creator, Tenris De'Thar, and his fellow Trelkins, who had created it to develop a weapon to turn the tide of the war, but he was forced to launch it into space due to a Broodwarrior attack. The Broodwarrior's mission is to find and capture it so his race can analyze it. After his first encounter with the Broodwarrior, Spencer escapes, forces Cy to eject him out of the suit, and abandons it telling it he's afraid he might not \\"live to see his next birthday\\" if he \\"engages\\" the Broodwarrior. Back at home, after he looks over one of his comic books titled MidKnight Warrior and he thinks about what the title character, in his situation, would do, he goes back out to find Cy. He unexpectedly finds himself accompanied by Turbo, now becoming his friend, only to find out Cy has been captured by the Broodwarrior. They head to the junkyard, where Cy is about to be taken off-world by the Broodwarrior, and create a plan to distract the Broodwarrior long enough for Spencer to rescue Cy. Spencer gets Cy back and begins battling with the Broodwarrior. During the battle, the Broodwarrior gets the upper hand and defeats Cy and Spencer. After getting bashed multiple times by the Broodwarrior's mace and severely damaging the suit, Cy is forced to eject Spencer out of it before going completely offline. Spencer covers it with scrap metal to hide it from the Broodwarrior, takes a piece of it, and continues to fight the Broodwarrior, who was later trying to chase down Turbo. Spencer confronts the Broodwarrior before getting chased himself and is suddenly cornered inside of a junked ice cream truck. Just when the Broodwarrior is about to dispose of Spencer, Turbo finds a control panel and activates the car crusher the truck is sitting in, revealing the chase into it to be part of a trap. Spencer escapes while the Broodwarrior is compressed along with the truck into a solid metal cube, killing him. With the Broodwarrior now destroyed, the boys return to Cy but it appears that they were too late to save it. Just as Spencer begins to lose hope, Tenris De'Thar and a small group of Trelkin soldiers appear from a giant UFO orbiting Earth and quickly repair it, bringing it back to life. After Cy and Spencer say goodbye to one another, the head alien soldier gives Spencer a badge for his bravery and courage before their departure back to their home-world, and the long, eventful night finally comes to an end. The next day at school, a now confident Spencer, with encouragement from Turbo, starts up a conversation with Michelle.

It was released on Earache Records in October 1990. A concept album, The Key is centered on an occult (the influence of drummer/vocalist Mike Browning) meets sci-fi (influenced by guitarist Mike Davis) theme. The story follows a cyborg who travels back in time to the year 0 B.C. to assassinate Jesus Christ which leads to the destruction of Christianity (highlighted by the controversial track \\"Destroying the Manger\\") and the creation of a modern empire. In addition to their unusual lyrical content, the band employed the use of keyboards which was virtually unheard of at the time in the broader genre of death metal. The keyboards were generally used for song intros and more atmospheric purposes, however, and most of the album was based upon a more conventional guitar and drums approach, with Kam Lee of Massacre providing backing vocals. Browning has claimed that he has not seen any royalties from either this album or its follow up since he was kicked out of the band, blaming both former band members and Earache Records.

It is part of the Bansk√° Bystrica Region and has approximately 8,000 inhabitants. Etymology The name is probably derived from Slavic root krup. Proto-Slavic: kr«´p—ä, kr«´p—äj—å ‚Äì solid, strong. The root is present also in krupa (kr«´pa) ‚Äì a smaller fortress, a fortified settlement, -ina is a frequent suffix. Another theory is based on the meaning \\"coarse\\". The settlement could be named after the nearby river, as the river had a rough and rocky bottom. History The territory of modern- day Krupina was inhabited since the Neolithic, based on archaeological findings from the Bronze Age. The first written reference to the towns river dates back to 1135. The first people to inhabit it were the Slavs-Slovaks. Between the 12th and 13th century the Germans arrived in Krupina, later between the 17th and 18th centuries the Magyars (Hungarians). Along with Trnava, Krupina is the oldest town in Slovakia, having received town privileges in 1238. The settlement lay on a route known as the \\"via magna\\", connecting the Baltic Sea with the Adriatic. After the Mongol invasion of 1241/1242, when the town was sacked, it was rebuilt and received its town privileges again in 1244 and became a \\"free royal town\\". The \\"Krupina law\\", based on the Magdeburg rights, was the basis for many towns in central and northern Slovakia. The deposits of gold and silver ran out in the 14th century and thereafter the town's economy was based on handicraft and agriculture. In the first half of the 15th century the town was threatened by the remains of the Hussites led by John Giskra. As the Turks advanced into the Kingdom of Hungary, the town built its town walls and sentry tower, and the Turks couldn't capture the town until 1682. It was also besieged in 1582, 1647 and 1678 and was ravaged in 1626 by Turks. Turks held it until 1686. Later, Krupina was involved in the Kuruc uprisings at the beginning of the 18th century, burnt down in 1708 and suffered from a plague in 1710. The first schools were opened in the 18th century. After the break-up of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the town became part of Czechoslovakia, was briefly occupied by the Slovak Soviet Republic in 1919, came back quickly into Czechoslovakia, and since 1993 has been a part of Slovakia.

In 1886, ex-Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts Byron Weston donated $5,300 to the College. This money was used to grade and improve drainage of the complex. By 1893, Weston Field encompassed 13 acres that included facilities for baseball and football. Subsequently, Weston contributed another $2,500 to help fund the creation of an athletic cinder track and the construction of a grandstand that was completed in 1901. The previous grandstand and press box were constructed in 1987 and demolished in December 2013 Although maintenance upgrades and improvements occurred during the next several decades, a major renovation of Weston Field didn‚Äôt occur until the late 1980s, when the Anthony Plansky Track, funded by George Steinbrenner, was completed (1987) along with a three- story press box and aluminum bleachers on the east side of the field. The Renzi Lamb Field for lacrosse and intramural sports, completed in 2004, was the first artificial turf facility in Berkshire County.The Williams Record ‚Äì Christopher Weihs October 31, 2012  Geology  Weston Field is adjacent to Christmas Brook that drains more than 640 acres of higher ground located to the southwest of downtown Williamstown. The field‚Äôs location proximity to Christmas Brook and its associated wetlands has made it susceptible to recurrent drainage problems. A thick, impervious layer of clay beneath Weston Field keeps the groundwater close to the surface during any wet period. The field of thick sod was susceptible to intermittent muddy conditions.

It is the third sequel to Advise and Consent, for which Drury was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1960, and is followed by two alternate sequels of its own, Come Nineveh, Come Tyre (1973) and The Promise of Joy (1975). Plot After winning his party's nomination in Capable of Honor, U.S. President Harley Hudson dies in a suspicious plane crash. William Abbott, the Speaker of the House, is reluctantly elevated to the Presidency. The Majority Party immediately convenes its National Committee, torn between the supporters of California Governor Ted Jason and those of Secretary of State and former Illinois Senator Orrin Knox. Eventually Knox defeats Jason, but names Jason as his vice presidential nominee. At the conclusion of the novel, a gunman appears and opens fire on the two candidates and their wives. Publication Published in June 1968, Preserve and Protect is the third sequel to Advise and Consent, for which Drury was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1960. Advise and Consent and its sequels had been out of print for almost 15 years until WordFire Press reissued them in paperback and e-book format in 2014. Sequels The cliffhanger ending of Preserve and Protect allowed Drury to offer two concurrent and conflicting sequels: one in which Knox dies and Jason goes on to become president, and the other with the opposite result. Both have as their background the Sino-Soviet split and its possible ramifications for the United States. Come Nineveh, Come Tyre 1973's Come Nineveh, Come Tyre () finds Presidential candidate Orrin Knox and Vice Presidential nominee Ted Jason's wife Ceil as the victims, and Jason is elected to the presidency. The Russians and Chinese immediately take advantage of the weak Jason, and are able to achieve dominance over the United States by the end. The title refers to two cities mentioned in the Bible: the Phoenician Tyre, whose King Hiram was the ally of King Solomon and helped build the Jerusalem Temple; and Nineveh, whose inhabitants repented of their evil ways after the Prophet Jonah warned them of God's intention to destroy their city. The novel spent 26 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list. The Promise of Joy In 1975's The Promise of Joy (), Vice Presidential nominee Ted Jason and Beth Knox are the two killed, and Orrin Knox is elected as President. Knox continues to assist anti-Soviet rebels in Panama and the fictional African nation of Gorotoland, despite mounting pressure by the international community and within the United States to retreat. Deterred by Knox's inflexible will, the Russians and Chinese begin a war with each other. After the war sparks revolutions within both countries, the new governments request that the United States broker a peace. Despite the new leadership, it is clear that neither side is really willing to make compromises, and the conflict soon re-emerges. This leads to increased conflict within the United States, as there is mounting pressure on the president to intervene on behalf of the Soviets. At the end of the novel, Knox advises the nation that the United States will intervene in the Sino- Soviet conflict, but does not specify how or on which side.

Early career Antequera y Castro was born in Panama. He was an oidor (judge) in the Audiencia of Panama before traveling to Spain. He became a knight of the Order of Alc√°ntara. He was public prosecutor before the Audiencia of Charcas (Alto Peru, now Bolivia) in charge of protecting the Indians. In Paraguay He was sent from Charcas to Asunci√≥n, Paraguay in 1721 as an inspector and member of the Audiencia there. His instructions were to investigate charges made by the cabildo (city council) of Asunci√≥n against the governor of Paraguay, Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda. If the governor's guilt was established, Antequera was to remove him from office, occupy the office himself, and reestablish justice in the province. If, on the other hand, the governor was acquitted, Antequera was to wait until the expiration of his legal term in office, and then take over the government. Reyes Balmaceda was removed as governor, and Antequera earned the sympathy of the Spanish settlers in Paraguay. After the removal of Reyes, the Criollos named Antequera to take his place. Antequera became acting governor in August 1721. Reyes Balmaseda was restored in February 1722, but before the year was out, Antequera was again governor. He retained the position until March 5, 1725. The Jesuits, however, were supporters of the dismissed governor. They had been working actively to shelter the Indians from the forced-labor demands of the colonists, and were therefore resented by the colonists. Reyes Balmaseda had supported the Jesuits, and it was that connection that led to the colonists' call for his removal. After Antequera consolidated his power, he expelled the Jesuits. He then defeated a royalist force from Buenos Aires under Garc√≠a Ros. Reyes Balmaseda had fled to Corrientes, and in a surprise raid there, Antequera took him prisoner. There were suspicions he intended to proclaim himself king, independent of Spain. Defeat and capture In 1724, Jos√© de Armend√°riz, now the viceroy in Lima, ordered Buenos Aires governor Bruno Mauricio de Zabala to suppress the rebellion and send Antequera to Lima for trial. Zabala led an army which included 6,000 Indians from the Jesuit missions against Antequera. On instructions from King Philip V, Armend√°riz ordered the Jesuits readmitted. (After some delay, they reoccupied their college in Asunci√≥n on March 18, 1728). In the face of the army raised against them, Antequera's followers deserted him. In March 1725 he was forced to flee to a Franciscan convent in C√≥rdoba, and from there he later fled to Charcas. He was arrested at Chuquisaca in Charcas, and taken to Lima. He received the liberty of the city for four years while his case was being heard. On September 4, 1728, Antequera sent a report to the Audiencia of Charcas, defending his actions in Paraguay. Finally, in 1731, orders came from Madrid to execute him. Execution When he was brought to the Plaza de Armas, where he was to be beheaded, the crowd assembled there demanded his pardon and threw stones at his escort. Viceroy Armend√°riz, who was in attendance, rode among the crowd to try to quiet them, but he too was pelted with stones. Fearing that Antequera would escape, Armend√°riz ordered the soldiers to shoot him, which they did. They then turned their guns on the crowd. Several priests were killed. Antequera's corpse was then taken from his place of death to the scaffold and beheaded. The head was displayed publicly. In 1778, King Charles III of Spain annulled the verdict against Antequera, declaring him a good and loyal minister. Aftermath Another revolt broke out in Paraguay in 1730, under Doctor Fernando Mompox y Zayas (Mompox and Antequera had met in prison in Lima). Mompox asserted the sovereignty of the people over the king and attracted many formerly powerless poor colonists to the cause. These interrelated rebellions are known as the Revolt of the Comuneros, one of the first revolts of American colonists against European colonial rule. External links *A Vanished Arcadia by R. B.

It is in the Khajuraho village, and the temple complex is spread over an area of . It is in the western part of the village to the west of the Vishnu temple. The temple complex, in the Khajuraho village at an elevation of , is well connected by road, rail and air services. Khajuraho is to the south of Mahoba, away from the Chhatarpur city to its east, away from Panna, by road away from Jhansi on the north, and to the south - east of Delhi. It is from the railway station. Khajuraho is served by Khajuraho Airport (IATA Code: HJR), with services to Delhi, Agra and Mumbai. It is from the temple. History Khajuraho was once the capital of the Chandela dynasty. The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple,one of the best examples of temples preserved from the medieval period in India, is the largest of the western group of temples in the Khajuraho complex which was built by the Chandela rulers. Shiva is the chief deity in the temple deified in the sanctum sanctorum. The Kandariya Mahadeva temple was built during the reign of Vidyadhara (r. c. 1003-1035 CE). At various periods of the reign of this dynasty many famous temples dedicated to Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Shakti of the Hindu religion and also for the Thirthankaras of Jain religion were built. Vidhyadhara, also known as Bida in the recordings of the Muslim historian Ibn- al-Athir was a powerful ruler who fought Mahmud of Ghazni in the first offensive launched by the latter in 1019. This battle was not conclusive and Mahmud had to return to Ghazni. Mahmud again waged war against Vidhyadhara in 1022. He attacked the fort of Kalinjar. The siege of the fort was unsuccessful. It was lifted and Mahmud and Vidhyadhara called a truce and parted by exchanging gifts. Vidhyadhara celebrated his success over Mahmud and other rulers by building the Ka·πá·∏çƒÅriyƒÅ MahƒÅdeva Temple, dedicated to his family deity Shiva. Epigraphic inscriptions on a pilaster of the mandapa in the temple mentions the name of the builder of the temple as Virimda, which is interpreted as the pseudonym of Vidhyadhara. Its construction is dated to the period from 1025 and 1050 AD. All the extant temples including the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple were inscribed in 1986 under the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites under Criterion III for its artistic creation and under Criterion V for the culture of the Chandelas that was popular till the country was invaded by Muslims in 1202. Features Various features of the temple marked on the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple. Simplified map of the temple The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, in height, is in the western complex, which is the largest among the three groups of the Khajuraho complex of temples. This western group of temples, consisting of the Kandariya, Matangeshwara and Vishvanatha temples, is compared to a \\"cosmic design of a hexagon (a yantra or Cosmo gram)\\" representing the three forms of Shiva. The temple architecture is an assemblage of porches and towers which terminates in a shikhara or spire, a feature which was common from the 10th century onwards in the temples of Central India. The temple is founded on a massive plinth of height. The temple structure above the plinth is dexterously planned and pleasingly detailed. The superstructure is built in a steep mountain shape or form, symbolic of Mount Meru which is said to be the mythical source of creation of the world. The superstructure has richly decorated roofs which rise in a grand form terminating in the shikara, which has 84 miniature spires. The temple is in layout of , of which 22 are extant including the Ka·πá·∏çƒÅriyƒÅ MahƒÅdeva Temple. This temple is characteristically built over a plan of in length and in width with the main tower soaring to a height of , and is called the \\"largest and grandest temple of Khajuraho\\". A series of steep steps with high rise lead from the ground level to the entrance to the temple. The layout of the temple is a five-part design, a commonality with the Lakshmana and Vishvanatha temples in the Khajuraho complex. Right at the entrance there is torana, a very intricately carved garland which is sculpted from a single stone; such entrances are part of a Hindu wedding procession. The carvings on the entrance gate shows the \\"tactile quality of the stone and also the character of the symmetrical design\\" that is on view in the entire temple which has high relief carvings of the figurines. Finely chiseled, the decorative quality of the ornamentation with the sharp inscribed lines has \\"strong angular forms and brilliant dark-light patterns\\". The carvings are of circles, undulations giving off spirals or sprays, geometric patterns, masks of lions and other uniform designs which has created a pleasant picture that is unique to this temple, among all others in the complex. The main temple tower with 84 mini spires Erotic sculptures on the external walls of the temple In the interior space from the entrance there are three mandapas or halls, which successively rise in height and width, which is inclusive of a small chamber dedicated to Shiva, a chamber where the Shiva linga, the phallic emblem of Shiva is deified. The sanctum sanctorum is surrounded by interlinked passages which also have side and front balconies. Due to inadequate natural light in the balconies the sanctum has very little light thus creating a \\"cave like atmosphere\\" which is in total contrast to the external parts of the temple. In the interior halls of the temple and on its exterior faces there are elaborately carved sculptures of gods and goddesses, musicians and apsaras or nymphs. The huge pillars of the halls have architectural features of the \\"vine or scroll motif\\". In the corners of the halls there are insets which are carved on the surface with incised patterns. There is a main tower above the sanctum and there are two other towers above the other mantapas also in the shape of \\"semi-rounded, stepped, pyramidal form with progressively greater height\\". The main tower is encircled by a series of interlinked towers and spires of smaller size. These are in the form of a repeated subset of miniature spires that abut a central core which gives the temple an unevenly cut contour similar to the shape of a mountain range of mount Kailasa of the Himalayas where god Shiva resides, which is appropriate to the theme of the temples here. The exterior surfaces of the temples are entirely covered with sculptures in three vertical layers. Here, there are horizontal ribbons carved with images, which shine bright in the sun light, providing rhythmic architectural features. Among the images of gods and heavenly beings, Agni, the god of fire is prominent. They are niches where erotic sculptures are fitted all round which are a major attraction among visitors. Some of these erotic sculptures are very finely carved and are in mithuna (coitus) postures with maidens flanking the couple, which is a frequently noted motif. There is also a \\"male figure suspended upside\\" in coitus posture, a kind of yogic pose, down on his head. The niches also have sculptures of Saptamatrikas, the septad of mother goddesses along with the gods Ganesha and Virabhadra. The seven fearful protector goddesses include: Brahmi seated on a swan of Brahma; Maheshwari with three eyes seated on Shiva's bull Nandi; Kumari; Vaishnavi mounted on Garuda; the boar-headed Varahi; the lion-headed Narasimhi and Chamunda, the slayer of demons Chanda and Munda. The image of Sardula, a mythical creature with lion face and human limbs in lower panel is a unique figure seen in the temple.

He spent most of his career at the University of Cambridge, rising to become a professor at the age of 50. He retired in 2017 as Professor Emeritus of Mediterranean History. He is a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was Chairman of the History Faculty at Cambridge University, 2003-5, and was elected a member of the governing Council of Cambridge University in 2008. He is visiting Beacon Professor at the new University of Gibraltar, where he also serves on the Academic Board. He is a visiting Professor at the College of Europe (Natolin branch, Poland). He is a Fellow of the British Academy and a member of the Academia Europaea. In 2013 he was awarded one of three inaugural British Academy Medals for his work on Mediterranean history. In 2020, he was awarded the Wolfson History Prize for The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans. Early life and education Abulafia was born at Twickenham, Middlesex, into a Sephardic Jewish family that left Spain for Galilee around 1492 and lived for many generations in Ottoman Tiberias. He was educated at St. Paul's School and King's College, Cambridge. Academic career He has published several books on Mediterranean history, beginning with his book The Two Italies in 1977; here he argued that as far back as the twelfth century northern Italy exploited the agricultural resources of the Italian south, and that this provided the essential basis for the further expansion of trade and industry in Tuscany, Genoa and Venice. He edited volume 5 of the New Cambridge Medieval History and the volume on Italy in the central Middle Ages in the Oxford Short History of Italy; he also edited an important collection of studies of the French invasion of Italy in 1494-5 as well as a book on The Mediterranean in History which has appeared in six languages. He has given lectures in many countries including Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Finland, Norway, the United States, Dominican Republic, Japan, China, Israel, the UAE, Jordan, and Egypt. One of his most influential books is Frederick II: A Medieval Emperor, first published in England in 1988 and reprinted many times in several Italian editions. Here he looks at an iconic figure from the Middle Ages from a new perspective, criticizing the views of the famous German historian Ernst Kantorowicz concerning Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, whom Abulafia sees as a conservative figure rather than as a genius born out of his time. He has been appointed Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity by the President of Italy in recognition of his writing on Italian history, especially Sicilian history, and he has also written about Spain, particularly the Balearic islands. He has shown an interest in the economic history of the Mediterranean, and in the meeting of the three Abrahamic faiths in the Mediterranean. Not confining himself to the Mediterranean, he has also written a much-praised book on the first encounters between western Europeans and the native societies of the Atlantic (the Canary islands, the Caribbean and Brazil) around 1492; this book is The Discovery of Mankind: Atlantic Encounters in the Age of Columbus (2008). In 2011 Penguin Books (and, in the U.S., Oxford University Press New York) published his The Great Sea: A Human History of the Mediterranean, a substantial volume that sets out a different approach to Mediterranean history to that propounded by the famous French historian Fernand Braudel, and ranges in time from 22,000 BC to AD 2010. The book, which received the Mountbatten Literary Award from the Maritime Foundation,Academia Europaea rapidly became a bestseller in UK non-fiction and was widely acclaimed. It has been translated into Dutch, Greek, Turkish, Spanish, German, Italian, Korean, Chinese, Romanian and Portuguese, with further translations under contract. Abulafia wrote The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans, published by Penguin in the UK and by Oxford University Press in the US in October 2019. This book applies a similar method to his history of the Mediterranean, looking at the people who moved across the open sea, and emphasizing the role of maritime trade in the political, cultural and economic history of humanity. It won the 2020 Wolfson History Prize. He was the chairman of Historians for Britain, an organisation that lobbies to leave the European Union. According to Abulafia, the process of European Integration is \\"a myth used to silence other visions of European community\\". He has written opinion pieces criticising the UK's membership in the European Union, accusing the idea of European unity of being based upon \\"historical determinism\\".David Abulafia: The EU is in thrall to a historical myth of European unity, Daily Telegraph, 26 February 2015.

That legislation established a state boating agency dedicated to all aspects of recreational boating and a special fund (Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund) to fund the division‚Äôs activities. The division receives no General Fund support. The division brings together a body of knowledge as the state‚Äôs expert in recreational boating-related matters, including public access, safety and education, marine law enforcement, and consumer and environmental protection. For example, DBW is responsible for planning, developing, and improving facilities on state-owned and state-managed properties, including those on State Parks and State Water Project properties. It also provides funding so that local agencies can renew deteriorated facilities or develop new public access. In addition, the division is heavily involved in furthering environmentally sound boating practices through its clean and green programs. DBW conducts and sponsors oceanographic research in marina pollution, sea level, wave measurement, modeling and prediction, beach processes, and coastal flooding and erosion, as they relate to boating facilities, access, safety, and education, and beach restoration and coastal protection. Close cooperation with Scripps Institution of Oceanography facilitate these activities. The division serves all types of recreational boaters statewide. California has about 2.6 million recreational boats and over 4 million recreational boaters. Recreational boating annually contributes several billion dollars to the state‚Äôs economy. The current Deputy Director of California Division of Boating and Waterways is Ms. Lynn Sadler. Units The Division of Boating and Waterways is made of two Enforcement and Environmental units to coordinate the division's responsibilities. Between them, both units oversee 17 programs, ranging from boater safety rules to species control. Pollution controls California Division of Boating and Waterways heavily regulates the use of carbureted and electronic-injection two-stroke engines manufactured prior to 1989 in California waters, considering them high-emission polluters. Due to emission standards, The division has banned their use on several lakes throughout the state. Direct injection two-stroke engines made since 1989, however, are permitted on the state's waterways with some non-emission standard exceptions. Non-native species removal California Division of Boating and Waterways' Aquatic Pest Control Program has since 1982 targeted to control water hyacinth from state waters. A native of the Amazon River in South America, the water hyacinth was introduced to the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in the early 20th century. Due to the quick blooming of the water hyacinth, the plant displaces native wildlife, blocks light needed for photosynthesis, reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, and deposits silt and organic matter at several times the normal rate. In 1997, the division added the egeria densa, another South American native, onto its list of species targeted for control and eradication.

An XC-142A first flew conventionally on 29 September 1964, and on 11 January 1965, it completed its first transitional flight by taking off vertically, changing to forward flight and finally landing vertically. Its service sponsors pulled out of the program one by one, and it eventually ended due to a lack of interest after demonstrating its capabilities successfully. Development In 1959 the United States Army, Navy and Air Force began work on the development of a prototype V/STOL aircraft that could augment helicopters in transport-type missions. Specifically they were interested in designs with longer range and higher speeds than existing helicopters, in order to support operations over longer distances, or in the case of the United States Marine Corps, from further offshore. On 27 January 1961, a series of DOD actions resulted in an agreement where all of the military services would work on the Tri-Service Assault Transport Program under the Navy's Bureau of Naval Weapons (BuWeps) leadership. The original outline had been drawn up as a replacement for the Sikorsky HR2S, with a payload on the order of 10000 lb (4500 kg). BuWeps released a revised specification that specified the same payload, but extended the operational radius to and increased the cruising airspeed to and the maximum airspeed to . However, for the Marine Corps mission, the requirement stated that the fuel load could be reduced so that the maximum gross weight would not exceed , as long as a radius was maintained. Vought responded with a proposal combining engineering from their own design arm, as well as Ryan and Hiller, who had more extensive helicopter experience. Their proposal won the design contest, and a contract for five prototypes was signed in early 1962 with first flight specified for July 1964. The design was initially known as the Vought-Ryan-Hiller XC-142, but when Vought became part of the LTV conglomerate this naming was dropped. During the prototype development the Navy decided to exit the program. They were concerned that the strong propeller downwash would make it difficult to operate. Their existing HR2S fleet had a ground pressure of about , and proved to blow people about on the ground and stir up considerable amounts of debris. The C-142 was predicted to have an even higher loading of , which they believed would limit it to operations to and from prepared landing pads and was therefore unsuitable for assault operations. The first prototype made its first conventional flight on 29 September 1964, first hover on 29 December 1964, and first transition on 11 January 1965. The first XC-142A was delivered to the Air Force test team in July 1965. During the XC-142A program, a total of 420 hours were flown in 488 flights. The five XC-142As were flown by 39 different military and civilian pilots. Tests included carrier operations, simulated rescues, paratroop drops, and low-level cargo extraction. During testing the aircraft's cross-linked driveshaft proved to be its Achilles heel. The shaft resulted in excessive vibration and noise, resulting in a high pilot workload. Additionally, it proved susceptible to problems due to wing flexing. Shaft problems, along with operator errors, resulted in a number of hard landings causing damage. One crash occurred as a result of a failure of the driveshaft to the tail rotor, causing three fatalities. One of the limitations found in the aircraft was an instability between wing angles of 35 and 80 degrees, encountered at extremely low altitudes. There were also high side forces which resulted from yaw and weak propeller blade pitch angle controls. The new \\"2FF\\" propellers also proved to generate less thrust than predicted. Design XC-142A at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force The basic design was fairly typical for a cargo aircraft, consisting of a large boxy fuselage with a tilted rear area featuring a loading ramp. It had a wingspan of and was long overall. The fuselage housed a long, wide high cargo area with a somewhat boxy cockpit on the front for the crew of two pilots and a loadmaster. The wing was high- mounted and the tail surfaces were a \\"semi-T-tail\\" to keep the rear area clear during loading. Tricycle landing gear were used, with the main legs retracting into blisters on the fuselage sides. In normal parked configuration it would appear to be a conventional cargo plane. For V/STOL operations, the aircraft \\"converted\\" by tilting its wing to the vertical. Roll control during hover was provided by differential clutching of the propellers, while yaw used the ailerons, which were in the airflow. For pitch control the aircraft featured a separate tail rotor, oriented horizontally to lift the tail, as opposed to the more conventional anti-torque rotors on helicopters that are mounted vertically. When on the ground, the tail rotor folded against the tail to avoid being damaged during loading. The wing could be rotated to 100 degrees, past vertical, in order to hover in a tailwind. The C-142 was powered by four General Electric T64 turboshaft engines cross-linked on a common driveshaft, which eliminated engine-out asymmetric thrust problems during V/STOL operations, to drive four Hamilton Standard fiberglass propellers. Compared to conventional designs it was overpowered: it had 0.27 hp/lb, compared to 0.12 hp/lb for the contemporary Lockheed C-130D Hercules. This extra power was required for safe VTOL operations, and gave the aircraft excellent all-around performance which included a maximum speed of over , making it one of the fastest VTOL transport aircraft of the era. Operational history The XC-142 during trials aboard , in 1966 The aircraft never proceeded beyond the prototype stage. In 1966, while tests were still underway, the Air Force requested a proposal for a production version, the C-142B. Since the Navy had backed out by this time, the Navy carrier compatibility requirement could be eliminated, which dramatically reduced the empty weight. Other changes proposed for this version included a streamlined cockpit, larger fuselage, upgraded engines and simplified engine maintenance. After reviewing the C-142B proposal, the tri-services management team could not develop a requirement for a V/STOL transport. XC-142A testing ended, and the remaining flying copy was turned over to NASA for research testing from May 1966 to May 1970. In service it would carry 32 equipped troops or of cargo. It had maximum gross weight of for a vertical take-off and for a short takeoff. A civilian version, the Downtowner, was also proposed. This was designed to carry 40‚Äì50 passengers at a cruise speed of using only two of its engines.McPhee, Andrew. \\"Beating Gravity: Vought-Hiller-Ryan XC-142A\\". unrealaircraft.com, 2005.

Development along the route largely ends at the intersection with West State Street; however, a pair of isolated homes are situated on NY 309 about to the northeast ahead of an intersection with CR 122, an east‚Äìwest highway that serves the Fulton County Infirmary a short distance to the west. The route continues to wind its way through the mountains to the hamlet of West Bush, where Cayadutta Creek ends amidst a small cluster of houses. The route turns north at this point, passing a handful of homes before leaving the community upon passing through a narrow pass between two hills. North of West Bush, the route rapidly ascends in elevation as it climbs up the side of a large mountain. Along this stretch, the route veers to the northwest and southeast as it heads through an area of wilderness. NY 309 crosses the Blue Line into Adirondack Park near the mountain's summit. Upon reaching the top of the mountain, the highway straightens out and heads northward for roughly across the hill's plateau. Upon reaching the other side, the road gradually descends in elevation as it passes by Mountain Lake and enters the town of Bleecker. The highway continues its northeastward descent into the small lakeside hamlet of Bleecker, where NY 309 ends at an intersection with Lily Lake Road. At this point, the roadway becomes CR 112. History Part of CR 112 was originally part of an old Indian trail that went from Johnstown to Hamilton County via Bleecker. At some point, part of the trail in the vicinity of Bleecker was converted into a plank road that served several locations and churches north of Bleecker. Meanwhile, NY 309 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a connector highway between the city of Gloversville and the hamlet of Bleecker.

The ensemble performs at all home football games and periodically makes appearances at events in the greater Chicagoland area. The band also performs at any postseason football games and one \\"away trip\\" per season (typically either a Big Ten Conference game or a judged marching band festival). History The Early Years (1911‚Äì1952) In 1911, Northwestern's first University-sanctioned marching band was organized to play at football games. Under student leadership, their numbers varied before they were put under the supervision of the School of Music in 1926. The band's first director, Glenn Cliffe Bainum, took the helm in 1926 and introduced diverse halftime drill formations. In the early 1940s, with Bainum serving in the military, Harold Finch took over as band director until 1945, when the band was disbanded due to lack of personnel. Bainum restarted the marching band program in 1947 and continued as director until 1950.250x250px The Paynter Years (1953‚Äì1995) John P. Paynter became acting director of bands in 1950‚Äì1951 while working on his master's degree and became official director of bands in 1953. During the next forty-three years of his leadership, NUMB developed many of the traditions and culture it still has today. Among the accomplishments during his tenure were NUMB's incorporation of women in the 1970s, and the band's innovative use of drill charts to develop marching shows. In 1970, James Sudduth became the first person (other than Paynter) to hold the title of marching band director. In the years that followed, several others held the position, including Cliff Colnot, William Hochkeppel, Donald Casey and Don Owens. In 1983, the position of the director of the marching band was shifted to the Athletic Department, and Dale Lonis became the first director of athletic bands. Under Lonis' leadership, the glide step was added to the halftime show style. The \\"N\\" formed during the band's pregame routine was slightly altered to match the new \\"sculpted N\\" logo which the university had adopted. Stephen G. Peterson took over leadership of the band in 1987. During his tenure, the band was awarded the 1992 Sudler Trophy in recognition of a tradition of excellence. In the 1995 NCAA football season, Northwestern's football team won the Big Ten Championship, earning themselves and NUMB a berth in the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1949. To mark the occasion NUMB ordered new uniforms for the Rose Bowl game, which were completed and shipped to the band in less than a month. Peterson and Paynter both accompanied the band to Southern California. NUMB played a halftime show consisting of opera favorites, including the Overture to William Tell, and Paynter led the band during its performances of the Northwestern Alma Mater. Paynter died on February 4, 1996, just more than a month after conducting the band at the Rose Bowl. His Northwestern life was bookended by the school's only two Rose Bowl appearances (he was an NU marching band member in 1949). Recent History (1996‚Äìpresent) In 1996, Mallory Thompson was hired to fill the Director of Bands position left vacant by Paynter's passing. That season the team went to the Florida Citrus Bowl, and NUMB featured the Northwestern Percussion Ensemble in its performance of Malague√±a. Peterson parted ways with the university following the 1996 season and was replaced by Rodney Dorsey, who served through 1999. Dan Farris, NUMB's current director, was hired as Director of Athletic Bands in 2000. Recent post-season appearances include: the Alamo Bowl (2000, 2008), the Motor City Bowl (2003), the Sun Bowl (2005), the Outback Bowl (2010, 2016), the Ticket City Bowl (2011), the Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas (2011), the Gator Bowl (2013), the Pinstripe Bowl (2016), the Music City Bowl (2017), the Holiday Bowl (2018), and the Big Ten Championship (2018). A major milestone for the group in this period was when Northwestern Athletics began funding the band in 2011. Funding has allowed the band to operate on a larger budget, meaning that the band can report earlier for band camp and pays to stay in university housing during the weeks before Northwestern's fall quarter begins. The band was also able to purchase new uniforms in 2011. NUMB's instrumentation includes a drum line, brass and woodwind sections, a color guard, and two drum majors. Pregame and Halftime Shows 350x350px The Northwestern University \\"Wildcat\\" Marching Band's pregame show lasts around ten minutes and features the following musical works (as of 2018): * \\"Fanfare\\"‚Äì a medley of the Northwestern spirit tunes performed as the drum majors enter the field from the tunnel * \\"Downfield\\" * \\"Push On,\\" featuring the block \\"N\\" drill * \\"Patriotic Medley,\\" featuring American flag and star drill * The Visiting Team's Fight Song * \\"Go U Northwestern,\\" featuring drill in the shape of the Northwestern Athletics \\"sculpted N\\" logo * \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" The pregame show is performed using a combination of traditional chair-step marching as well as the Drum Corps International (DCI) influenced glide step. The band's halftime shows primarily use the glide step technique. The drill is written by the Director of Athletic Bands and graduate conducting students in the Bienen School of Music. Several different drills and musical selections are played during the season, with music generally including various rock, jazz, and pop selections. Traditions  March of the Steelman  While Charles Belsterling was Vice President of U.S. Steel he wrote the march that came to be known as \\"March of the Steelman.\\" Glenn Cliffe Bainum adapted the music to match a drill called the \\"Old Plus-Four.\\" It has since been performed at the close of every home football season since 1928. The drill showcases the Northwestern monogram and a line of brass spanning length of the football field. Colors of the Big Ten Since 1948, the \\"Wildcat\\" Band has been fronted by the colors of the Big Ten Conference universities. In 1975, purple and white flags were also added. The 2017 season marks the first time that the Wildcat Band has fielded all of the Big Ten colors since the conference expanded to include fourteen member universities. The band had previously only fielded the Big Ten West flags. Alma Mater The band is known for its a cappella performance of the University Hymn (also known as the Alma Mater). Under the baton of the Director of Bands, new students and veteran members learn and practice the Alma Mater at each year. It is performed during halftime and post game and is sung in four-part harmony following the conclusion of the post-game performance. On certain occasions (such as the 1996 Rose Bowl and the 2005 Sun Bowl) the Alma Mater is performed during the pre-game show. The melody of the Alma Mater is based on the Chorale St. Antoni by Franz Josef Haydn (also heard in Johannes Brahms' Variations on a Theme by Haydn, Op. 56B). The text originally was sung entirely in Latin (written by J. Scott Clark), but in 1953 the music was arranged by John Paynter and new English lyrics were written by Thomas Tyra. High School Band Day Beginning in 1956, John Paynter began the tradition of inviting high school marching bands from the Chicago area to join NUMB on the field for halftime at one game each year. While Band Day was dropped from the schedule for several years in the '90s, it returned in 2004 and continues to be a feature each year. At its peak there were nearly 10,000 high school musicians participating. NUMBALUMS NUMBALUMS are those band members who have graduated. The NUMBALUMS perform during Homecoming at the parade, alumni gatherings, and during the pre-game and halftime shows at the Homecoming football game. NUMBALUMS also perform at such other occasions as away games where the student Band does not make an official appearance, but where there are sufficient NUMBALUMS available to put together a Spirit Band to cheer on the football team. The NUMBALUMS were created by John Paynter in 1972, formally chartered as an organization in 1999, and officially recognized by the Northwestern Alumni Association in 2002. The NUMBALUMS are an active organization that not only provides opportunities for the Alums to get together and perform, but also has raised funds for the purchase of new uniforms and equipment for NUMB. There are currently roughly 3,000 members.http://northwesternbands.org/numbalums In April 2014, NUMBALUMS made public its efforts to establish the Northwestern Bands Push On Fund. The Endowment will be entirely donation-funded and used to improve the lives of Band members and the Band as a whole.http://go.numbalums.org/growl_spring2014 The SpiriTeam Founded in the 1960s, the \\"SpiriTeam\\" consists of two leaders of the band: the \\"Spirit Leader\\" and the \\"Grynder\\" (also known as \\"Grinder\\"). Traditions surrounding the SpiriTeam evolved over time, reflecting the personalities of the members of the SpiriTeam. The 2007 season marked the first all-female SpiriTeam. The Spirit Leader The Spirit Leader is in charge of leading the band, the students, and the home crowd in various cheers. By tradition, the Spirit Leader is elected by the band. The Spirit Leader's symbol of office is the Spirit Leader's Hat ‚Äì a black aviator-style cloth helmet, which according to tradition belonged to a Northwestern football player who served in World War II. The Grynder The Grynder assists the Spirit Leader with cheers and keeping the band's spirit up during football games. During weekly Spirit Sessions, The Grynder performs an often loud and exclamatory work of slam poetry focused on the upcoming game. In the past the Grynder has been in charge of special cheers, including a traditional post- halftime extended cheer extolling the spirit of the band and its ability to growl loud enough to rattle the other team, wake the dead, and to be heard by the Grynder's mother no matter where on Earth (or Heaven) she is. The Grynder is in possession of a mutant gene, recognizable only to the previous Grynder, who selects his/her successor. The Grynder's symbol of office is the Grynder's Hat ‚Äì a button-festooned black felt hat originally bought at the Wildcat's first Rose Bowl (1949) and handed down from Grynder to Grynder. The traditional goal of every Grynder is to take The Hat back to Pasadena and the Rose Bowl. The Geek The Geek's purpose is: to celebrate the traditional view of band members as \\"band geeks,\\" the band chooses one member to take on all duties of being the official \\"Band Geek.\\" The three official duties of the \\"Band Geek\\" are to be as loud and as obnoxious as possible, to assist the SpiriTeam‚Ñ¢ when necessary, and to embody the spirit of band geeks everywhere; past, present and future.

It was passed in 1531. It was intended to ensure the upkeep of bridges, which at the time were usually made of wood and required regular maintenance in order to keep them open. Section 3 ceased to have effect by virtue of section 311 of, and Schedule 23 to, the Highways Act 1959. The whole Act was repealed by section 312(2) of, and Schedule 25 to, the Highways Act 1959. The repeal effected by section 312(2) of the Highways Act 1959 was extended to Greater London by section 16(2) of, and paragraph 70 of Schedule 6 to, the London Government Act 1963. Section 1 In this section, the words \\"whereof one to be of the quorum\\" were repealed by section 1 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1948. Section I empowered justices of the peace to look into matters of broken bridges and to arrange for their repair or rebuilding by, or at the expense of, those who were responsible for their maintenance. Section 2 Under section II, in cases where those responsible could not be determined, the burden would fall on the inhabitants of the city or town the bridge was situated in; if it lay outside a town, then the burden would fall on the shire or riding as a whole. Section 3 In this section, the words \\"or iiii of the said justices at the leaste whereof one to be of the quorum\\", the words from \\"to call before them the constables\\" to \\"inhabitauntes shall have power and auctoritie\\", and the words from \\"and after such taxacion made\\" to \\"delyver to the owner thereof\\" were repealed by section 1 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1948.

The justices were to draw up a roll of all persons so taxed, and appoint two collectors in every hundred. The Justices were also given the power to appoint two surveyors to oversee the work, who would receive the money from the collectors. Section 7 In this section, the words \\"whereof one to be of the quorum\\" were repealed by section 1 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1948. Bridges Act 1803 The Bridges Act 1803 created some additional statutory provisions that had become necessary due to the effluence of time and events since the 1530 Act. This included giving statutory weight to the common law title of the key technical officials engaged for these functions by the Crown, namely, the county surveyor of the county responsible for the upkeep of subject bridges, and the roads over them for 100 yards past the ends of the bridge.The statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 19: Google eBooks: Accessed 16 October 2011 See also *Bridges Act References *Halsbury's Statutes, Other Reading *Tudor Constitutional Documents, AD 1485-1603, by J.R.

The institution and jurisdiction of the Natural Resources Agency is provided for in California Government Code sections 12800 and 12805, et seq. The Agency has six departments, 10 conservancies, 17 boards and commissions, three councils, and one urban park in Los Angeles that consists of two museums, the California Science Center and the California African American museum. Through its 25 departments, conservancies and commissions, the Natural Resources Agency is responsible for protecting prehistory history, natural landscapes and cultural sites, monitoring and stewarding state lands and waterways, and regulating fish and game use, as well as private lands and the intersection with federal lands and waters. The current Secretary for Natural Resources is Wade Crowfoot, and is a member of Governor Gavin Newsom's cabinet.  History  150 years ago, most of the state of California's natural resources were under federal jurisdiction, but as the state's population and needs grew, so did a desire for a closer-to-home approach to protecting the state's wildlands and wildlife. These sentiments led to the creation of the Board of Fish Commissioners in 1870 (the first wildlife conservation agency in the country), the Division of Forestry in 1881 (housed within the state‚Äôs Department of Agriculture) and the Board of Forestry in 1885. During this same period, federal and state leaders began to set aside land for preservation and public access. President Abraham Lincoln signed a federal law in 1864 that granted Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Big Tree Grove to create California‚Äôs first state park. In 1901, both land grants were returned to the federal government. A year later in 1902, the state purchased 2,500 acres of redwood forests in Santa Cruz to create Big Basin Redwood State Park, California's longest- running state park. At the turn of the 20th Century, California's emerged on the forefront of the preservation movement by expanding fish and game laws, establishing a state forester to regulate timber harvest, acquiring historical monuments, and passing the Water Commission Act in 1913 to establish the State Water Commission to oversee rights to use surface water. In 1927, Governor Clement Calhoun Young restructured many of state boards, commissions, divisions, and departments to create the Department of Natural Resources. This new Department included the Division of Forestry, known today as CAL FIRE (created in 1977), and a Division of Beaches and Parks, known today as the Department of State Parks and Recreation (created in 1967). In 1961, Governor Edmund G. ‚ÄúPat‚Äù Brown reorganized the executive branch and established the Resources Agency to consolidate management of the state‚Äôs diverse resources. The new agency oversaw the Department of Fish and Game (created in 1951), known today as the Department of Fish and Wildlife (renamed in 2012), Department of Water Resources (created in 1954), Department of Conservation (created in 1961). This restructure also placed most of the state's environmental quality programs within the Resources Agency. In 1991, those environmental quality programs, designed to limit environmental pollution, were placed under a new state agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency. In 2009, the Resources Agency adopted its current name of the California Natural Resources Agency to better reflect its primary mission of protecting the state's natural resources. Today, the California Natural Resources Agency stewards 100 million acres of California's land, hundreds of rivers and lakes, and more than 1,000 miles of coastline.

They are native to northeast Tanzania and have been introduced to Burundi and Kenya. Although they have been observed in the wild in Puerto Rico, they are probably the result of escaped pets, and no reproduction has been recorded. Description The yellow-collared lovebird is a mainly green small parrot about 14.5 cm (5.5 in) long. Its upperparts are a darker green than its lower surfaces. Its head is black, and it has a bright red beak with white above it and white eyerings. Yellow on the breast is continuous with a yellow collar and an expansion of yellow over the nape of the neck. Male and female have an identical external appearance. Breeding Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden The yellow-collared lovebird brings nesting material in its beak to a tree cavity for their nest. The eggs are white and there are usually four to five in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 23 days and the chicks leave the nest about 42 days after hatching. Aviculture At Auckland Zoo, New Zealand  Housing  White eye-rings lovebirds, of which masked lovebirds are part, are reportedly less aggressive in comparison to the slightly larger peach-faced lovebird. They are frequently housed in aviaries with other species of their genus, a practice which although can be convenient, and wonderfully aesthetic, may lead to hybridization. This can especially be concerning where other species may not be as locally common e.g. black-cheeked lovebird, and Lilian's lovebird. It would be advisable to house lovebirds either; by themselves, or if a mixed collection is desired, ensure they are kept in a large flight with a few feeding stations, & assertive species e.g. red-rumped parrot, kakariki, rose-ringed parakeet or cockatiels. They can usually be kept safely with quails, and pheasants in aviaries. Breeding cages should be 400mm x 400mm x 500mm, or these birds can be housed in colonies, or have in some cases been kept at liberty. There was a mixed flock of masked, peach-faced lovebird, and a few hybrids near Napier, New Zealand for a number of years in the mid 2000s. There is also a small feral population in France, which contains the Blue mutant, and mixes with larger proportion of Fischer's lovebirds - also from aviary origin. Aviaries, and cages need perches in a range of diameters. Natural perches in the form of branches are ideal, especially if they have a variety of forks, angles, and a bit of bounce in them. The reason for this is to give the captives stimuli; it also keeps their feet healthy, and nimble. Research (suitability, and toxicity) must be carried out on all plant material going into any cages. Cherry wood is poisonous, as is broom, kowhai, and avocado (its fruit being surprisingly poisonous to parrots), to mention just a few examples. Nesting boxes are usually utilised throughout the year as sleeping quarters. It is advisable to clean them, but keep them up even after breeding season. The risk of losing a bird to egg laying complications (in the unlikely event they do decide to breed in the winter), is out-weighed by the benefit of keeping the birds content, keeping pair-bonds strong, & the reduced risk of losing a bird to the cold. A supply of willow branches, and roughly slivered corn, or maize husk can be given in the aviary as nesting box lining: It will be ripped up, & carried into the nest box by the female. Lovebirds are reasonably difficult to sex. A \\"pair\\" will often be of the same gender, even though they are exhibiting signs of mutual affection. This usually arises when inexperienced bird keepers house two birds alone, & wait on behavioral signs that they're a true pair, with the intention of swapping one out for another lovebird if they're not; then being excited when they see birds pair up, even though they may both be of the same sex. These bonds are artificial, & can be broken, or tested if the \\"pair\\" are re-housed communally (or split up by the keeper). One or both of a pair of males may go, and breed with lone hens, despite staying connected to their original partner. Or the same sex pair's bond may completely dissolve immediately.  Colour varieties  The blue mutation was originally found in wild birds in the 1920s and is the oldest colour mutation known in the lovebird genus. The other mutations are a result of selective breeding in aviculture, such as two cobalts which will make a mauve (black). Various color mutations exist, including blue, cobalt, mauve, slate, dilute slate, violet, lutino (ino) and albino. The Blue and the Lutino mutations are where some colour genes have not been passed on, or have been suppressed from the original wild colour form. In the case of the lutino the micro-structure which creates the blue based colours in the normal form is not passed on to offspring when it arises; hence everywhere yellow except the face which contained the colours which make up orange. In the case of the original Blue, none of the yellow or red pigment genes are passed on. The Albino is the latest \\"colour\\" which is a combination of the Lutino, and the Blue ('wild' colouring minus blue, and minus red and yellow = no colour so is completely white). The Dilute mutation is a lightening of the darker feathers, most noticeable in the wings, and face. It was first noted from Green (Wild) coloured parents, & originally called \\"Yellow\\". This new colour was soon built up in numbers by passionate aviculturelists, and once secure was bred to Blue coloured birds. The result was then known as \\"White\\", but we now call this combo a Dilute Blue.

The character first appeared in the 1960s as \\"Betty Kane\\", the Bat-Girl. Her name was later modified to \\"Bette Kane\\", and she assumed the role of Flamebird. Fictional character biography Pre- Crisis Betty Kane as Bat-Girl; art by Sheldon Moldoff. The original Bat- Girl first appeared in Batman #139 (April 1961) as Betty Kane, the niece of Kathy Kane, also known as Batwoman. After discovering her aunt's dual identity, Betty convinced Batwoman to train her as her sidekick. Batwoman and Bat-Girl were created to be romantic interests for Batman and Robin, respectively, as well as wannabe crime-fighting associates. Bat-Girl appeared six times between 1961 and 1964, but then disappeared in 1964 (along with Batwoman, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite) when new Batman editor, Julius Schwartz, decided she and other characters were too silly. It has been suggested by scholars that the characters of Batwoman (in 1956) and Bat-Girl (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute allegations of homosexuality in Batman comics; specifically, the enduring claim that Batman and Robin were homosexuals. Later in the 1970s Batwoman and Bat-Girl were revived and were regarded to have been inactive for several years. Bat-Girl became a member of the Teen Titans West. However, she only appeared four times in this era, at the end of the original run of the Teen Titans magazine. Post-Crisis In the post-Crisis DC Universe, the character known as Batwoman was erased from existence (although her alter ego, Kathy Kane, was revealed to have existed and was murdered by the League of Assassins). Batwoman's niece, Betty Kane, disappeared as well. Unlike her aunt, Betty's removal from history would not last long. For a brief time in the 1970s, Betty had joined the west coast version of the Teen Titans under her Bat-Girl moniker. Though \\"Bat-Girl\\" does not exist in the post-Crisis universe, her team did; therefore, a new version of the character was necessary. In Secret Origins Annual #3 (1989), the official post-Crisis history of Titans West was revealed. Instead of Betty Kane's Bat-Girl, fans were introduced to a similar character called Mary Elizabeth \\"Bette\\" Kane, also known as Flamebird. This was an in-joke, as the team of \\"Nightwing and Flamebird\\" had a history in the Silver Age continuity as a pair of supporting characters in the Superman books. Bette Kane becomes Flamebird and teams up with her idol, Dick Grayson; art by Phil Jimenez. Bette was now a very driven and somewhat spoiled Los Angeles debutante and tennis prodigy. After seeing Robin on the news, Bette vowed that she would gain his attention and favor by becoming a masked adventurer herself. Training to Olympic-levels in gymnastics and martial arts, she created the identity of Flamebird (and a costume that resembled her pre-Crisis Bat-Girl identity) and joined Titans West in hopes of catching Robin's eye. While flattered, the driven young hero was not sure how to deal with her obsession and avoided her, much to her dismay. After briefly giving up her heroic persona, Bette found that neither winning tennis tournaments nor achieving perfect grades in school matched the rooftop thrills of the hero biz. She attempted several times to reunite the Titans West team, most notably after a journey into the afterlife with Hawk and Dove, but was unsuccessful. Dove noted that Bette was essentially a very lonely person, basically desperate for company and contact with others. Bette again gave up her obsession with the Titans until malfunctioning former Titan Victor Stone collected her, along with all former Titans everywhere, in an attempt to protect his soul from the Justice League. Hoping this would lead to a formal invitation to rejoin the team, Bette was crushed to learn they did not need (or want) her assistance. A short time later, Gar \\"Beast Boy\\" Logan found himself alone in Los Angeles after the team neglected to ask him back. Landing himself in a bit of trouble by an impostor framing him for various crimes, Gar asked former teammate Bette for help.Beast Boy #2 Having been recently chastised for her dedication (or lack thereof) to crime-fighting by Robin (now in his adult Nightwing identity), Flamebird seized the opportunity to better herself and her reputation, becoming more level-headed and boosting her crime-fighting arsenal.Beast Boy #3 However, the design of her outfit as an adult has similarities to that of Dick Grayson's Nightwing outfit, with a red tunic and gold V running across the chest. After Bette helped Gar clear his name, his cousin Matt attempted one last recruitment drive for Titans West (dubbing the ill-fated team Titans L.A.).Beast Boy #4 None of the recruits took the event seriously except for insane and uninvited former Titan Duela Dent, who crashed the party and was subdued by Bette. Around the same time, she and Beast Boy both served on an ad hoc Young Justice team, which she hoped would raise their public profiles; however, the team only lasted for one mission. Content to remain a hero on her own, Bette was unheard from until she was captured by a Brainiac-worshipping cult leader in Oregon and eventually rescued by Oracle's covert team of female operatives in Birds of Prey. She fought Doctor Light alongside the majority of heroes who had once been members of the Teen Titans. Infinite Crisis Flamebird appeared in Infinite Crisis #4 to fight Superboy-Prime.Infinite Crisis #4 In this storyline, it was indicated that Flamebird had originally been the Earth-Two counterpart to Bat-Girl, and that after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Flamebird had replaced Bat-Girl on the sole remaining Earth. Flamebird, along with most of the Justice Society, disappeared when Earth-Two was reborn. In the Villains United special, Flamebird (and the other heroes who vanished to Earth-Two) had made it back to \\"New Earth\\" at some point after Infinite Crisis #6. She was among the many heroes gathered to fight off the invasion of Metropolis by the Society.Infinite Crisis #6Teen Titans #38 reveals that Flamebird briefly served on the Titans during the year-long gap.Teen Titans #38 Relationship to Batwoman Following the events of Infinite Crisis, it is revealed that Bette is the cousin of current Batwoman, Kate Kane. In Detective Comics #856, Bette moves to Gotham City to enroll in Gotham University. She encounters her cousin at a party thrown for the Gotham City Police Department, and attempts to chat her up, only to be blown off. According to Kate's father, Bette looks up to her and likes spending time with her. In Detective Comics #862, Bette is seen hunched over on her bed, staring at her Flamebird costume and asking Kate how to \\"let go of the past\\". Bette is kidnapped by a crazed serial killer known as the Cutter, and awakens bound and gagged in his workshop. The Cutter plans on removing Bette's ears as part of a plan to create a perfect woman through the use of stolen body parts. Batwoman rescues Bette from the killer and accidentally reveals her identity. At the end of the story, Bette is seen in her Flamebird outfit, telling Kate that she wants to become her new partner.Detective Comics #863 Kate eventually agrees to train Bette, and gives her a capeless grey military outfit and the codename Plebe.Batwoman #1 Later still, Bette acquires pyrotechnic technology and adopts the codename Hawkfire. As Hawkfire, she tries to rescue cousin Beth Kane from the clutches of the Department of Extranormal Operations, but is herself captured.Batwoman Vol. 2 #24 (December 2013); Batwoman Annual #1 (June 2014). A Bat-Girl looking similar to Betty Kane is revealed to have existed in the past in Batman #682, and later reappears in Batman, Inc. #4 (Apr. 2011). As in pre-Crisis continuity, she is the younger protege of the first Batwoman, Kathy Kane (who reappears in post-Infinite Crisis continuity as the original Batwoman, but with a revamped origin). It has not yet been confirmed if Bette Kane used the Bat-Girl identity in her younger years prior to becoming Flamebird or if Bat-Girl is a completely separate character. DC Rebirth In the DC Rebirth relaunch, Bette has enrolled at the United States Military Academy, seeming to be a yearling, or sophomore, cadet. She keeps in contact with Kate Kane and Julia Pennyworth, and even briefly visits Kate in Gotham.Batwoman (vol. 2) #1Detective Comics #967 Powers and abilities Flamebird is an exceptional athlete, trained for strength and endurance, and has worked as a professional tennis player. She has also trained in several forms of martial arts, with kickboxing as her specialty.Who's Who in the DC Universe vol 2 #2 (September 1990) As such, while she is a formidable martial arts opponent and combatant, she is not among the top tier or elite of DC's martial artists. Like Robin, Flamebird has a utility belt containing a grappling hook with line, gas grenades, gas mask, flares, flashlight, radio/transmitter, handcuffs, bird-shaped throwing blades (Bird-A-Rangs), and an emergency medical kit. She increased her arsenal by equipping her mask with lenses capable of emitting powerful bursts of blinding light, and created bird-like bolas that can electrocute anyone tangled in them. As Plebe, Batwoman's sidekick, Bette is stripped of her outfit and gadgetry, wearing a nondescript grey military outfit. Her martial arts prowess however is being improved by Batwoman's tutelage. Later, as Hawkfire, her costume features gold plated elements and she carries a wrist-mounted flamethrowing device. Since enrolling at West Point, she would have received the same sort of military training conducted there, which among other things would require instruction in firearms, boxing, Modern Army Combatives, and battlefield tactics. Other versions Flamebird assumes the mantle of Batwoman; art by Mike McKone. *In Teen Titans Go! #24, the Titans get their powers swapped. When Starfire is given Robin's abilities, she finds herself wearing Bette's original Bat-Girl costume. In issue #50, Flamebird is officially introduced via a small screen on the Titans Tower computer, and she appears again in issue #55 as a member of Titans North, wearing a red T-shirt with a burning bird emblem, cargo pants, and yellow goggles. *In The All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold #13, after the Robins manage to save Batman from death, Madame Xanadu shows Phantom Stranger a similar team of Batgirls, including Bette, Barbara Gordon, Stephanie Brown and Cassandra Cain. *In part two of Neil Gaiman's Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?, Bette is seen in her Silver Age Bat-Girl costume describing a death of Batman. He was holding a bomb that would destroy Gotham if he released its switch or if the timer ran down. Batman then throws himself into the Gotham River with the bomb to prevent the explosion from causing any damage. * In the alternate future storyline \\"Titans Tomorrow\\", it was revealed that after her death at the hands of Duela Dent, Batman (Tim Drake) used the Lazarus Pit to resurrect Flamebird, who assumed the alias of Batwoman and became his partner (and lover). But when he and the other Teen Titans began to take over the Western United States, Batwoman formed a Titans East team with the Titans who opposed their rule (Cyborg, Terra, Bumblebee, and Captain Marvel Jr.) and helped the Titans' past incarnations defeat the dark adult counterparts. After Infinite Crisis, the \\"Titans Tomorrow\\" timeline was altered by the deaths of Superboy and Bart Allen, with Duela Dent also being killed during Countdown. As such, in the \\"Titans Tomorrow... Today!\\" storyline, Bette remains Flamebird in the future, with Cassandra Cain being Batwoman. With the altered timeline, all the future heroes, even those who opposed the West Coast Titans, were unified in their fascistic endeavors to \\"save the world\\". * She appears in the 20th issue of the Young Justice tie-in comic series, it is shown that Bette has spent the night with Dick Grayson/Nightwing. * She appears in DC Bombshells. In other media * Bette appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Homefront\\" voiced by Alyson Stoner. She is a student at the Gotham Academy assigned to act as a liaison to Artemis Crock. In \\"Misplaced\\", Bette appears to be reading to young children with fellow school member Barbara Gordon/Batgirl. * A version of Bette Kane appears in Batwoman with the name Mary Hamilton, portrayed by Nicole Kang.

It is a simple generalization of the Euler method for ordinary differential equations to stochastic differential equations. It is named after Leonhard Euler and Gisiro Maruyama. Unfortunately, the same generalization cannot be done for any arbitrary deterministic method . Consider the stochastic differential equation (see It√¥ calculus) :\\\\mathrm{d} X_t = a(X_t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t + b(X_t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} W_t, with initial condition X0 = x0, where Wt stands for the Wiener process, and suppose that we wish to solve this SDE on some interval of time [0, T]. Then the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama approximation to the true solution X is the Markov chain Y defined as follows: * partition the interval [0, T] into N equal subintervals of width \\\\Delta t>0: ::0 = \\\\tau_{0} < \\\\tau_{1} < \\\\cdots < \\\\tau_{N} = T \\\\text{ and } \\\\Delta t = T/N; * set Y0 = x0; * recursively define Yn for 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ N by ::\\\\, Y_{n + 1} = Y_n + a(Y_n) \\\\, \\\\Delta t + b(Y_n) \\\\, \\\\Delta W_n, :where ::\\\\Delta W_n = W_{\\\\tau_{n + 1}} - W_{\\\\tau_n}. The random variables ŒîWn are independent and identically distributed normal random variables with expected value zero and variance \\\\Delta t. Example  Numerical simulation  Gene expression modelled as stochastic process An area that has benefited significantly from SDE is biology or more precisely mathematical biology. Here the number of publications on the use of stochastic model grew, as most of the models are nonlinear, demanding numerical schemes. The graphic depicts a stochastic differential equation being solved using the Euler Scheme. The deterministic counterpart is shown as well.  Computer implementation  The following Python code implements the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method and uses it to solve the Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process defined by : dY_t=\\\\theta \\\\cdot (\\\\mu-Y_t) \\\\, {\\\\mathrm d}t + \\\\sigma \\\\, {\\\\mathrm d}W_t : Y_0=Y_\\\\mathrm{init}.

Although she was not an aviator herself at first, she contributed to the glamour of aviation and general knowledge of it, by writing articles about her aerial adventures for US newspapers in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  Early life  Grace Lethbridge was the eldest daughter of Sidney Thomas Lethbridge and his wife Grace Emily (n√©e Willis). Her father was the managing director of the Spratt's dog and animal food company. Her father's sister was dancer Alice Lethbridge. She was married in 1920 to Sir Robert Hay Drummond-Hay (1846‚Äì1925) at the age of 25, her husband being nearly fifty years older.Sir Robert Hay-Drummond-Hay, ThePeerage.com website, 28 March 2009. Sir Robert was born in Tangiers, Morocco, and had been the British consul-general for years in Beirut, Lebanon. He was previously married to Euphemia Katrina Willis Flemming. Four children were produced in this marriage, Arnold Robert, Edward William, Cecil, and Florence Caroline. The children were all significantly older than their new stepmother, Florence Caroline being 15 years older. After six years of marriage, Sir Robert died. Lady Drummond-Hay then was 31 years old. As a young aristocratic widow she lived in her apartment in Finchley Road, London.  Career  Journalists being photographed before a launch of the Graf Zeppelin, left to right: Karl von Wiegand, Lady Drummond-Hay, Rolf Brand, and Robert Hartmann Lady Drummond-Hay on board the Graf Zeppelin Having contributed to British papers such as The Sphere, she began to write for Hearst papers in the late 1920s. She wrote a series of articles for the Chicago Herald and Examiner, as one of the passengers aboard the first transatlantic flight of a civilian passenger zeppelin in 1928. This airship, the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, was also the first to circumnavigate the world, in August 1929, taking off at Lakehurst, New Jersey and arriving there again 21 days later, after stops in Friedrichshafen, Germany, Tokyo, and Los Angeles.Los Angeles to Lakehurst, Time magazine, 9 September 1929 Captain Hugo Eckener commanded Graf Zeppelin on the flight. Drummond-Hay was the only female passenger. Among her 19 companion travellers were: * Australian explorer Sir George Hubert Wilkins * American multi-millionaire William B. Leeds * Commander Charles Emery Rosendahl (USN) * Naval observer Jack C. Richardson * Hearst correspondent Karl von Wiegand * Hearst photographer Robert Hartman * Spanish newspaper correspondent Joachim Rickard * German correspondent Heinz von Eschwege- Lichbert * Spanish physician Geronimo Megias, the personal doctor of Spanish King Alfonso XIII.\\"Around the World by Zeppelin\\" (BBC documentary programme published 8 Jan 2012) Drummond-Hay gained fame after she arrived in New York, and her career as a journalist was secured for the next decade. She went to war zones such as Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and was a foreign correspondent in Manchuria (China). She worked closely together for many years with her senior colleague Karl von Wiegand. Drummond-Hay was a well-known and respected journalist of the time, known for her beauty and wit, and the intelligence and flair of her writing. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie presented her with a precious jewel, which was displayed on her body at her funeral.  Last years  During World War II, Lady Drummond-Hay and von Wiegand were interned in a Japanese camp in the Philippines. When they were set free in 1943, she was ill and Karl suffered poor eyesight after a bomb blast. They returned to the United States on the Swedish rescue ship the SS Gripsholm in December 1943.Life Magazine, 20 Dec 1943 Lady Drummond-Hay died of coronary thrombosis in the Lexington Hotel on 12 February 1946.Time, Time magazine, 25 February 1946 At her funeral service, many people paid their last respects, including William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies. After she was cremated, her ashes were brought to the United Kingdom by von Wiegand.  Legacy  Though well known in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Lady Hay Drummond-Hay has been largely forgotten. Her name is mentioned in a number of books on the history of zeppelin flights, but no major biography or other significant document has been written about her life. An Australian documentary, The Airships: Ship Of Dreams (2004), included footage of her.TV Documentary, The Airships: Ship Of Dreams, Rob McAuley Production, 2004 Semidocumentary Farewell Lady Drummond-Hay's 1929 experience was explored in Vaarwel (\\"Farewell\\"), an episode of the Dutch documentary series ' (\\"The Hour of the Wolf\\"), released in 2009.

It runs between Shotwick and Helsby and connects the A550 at Woodbank to the M56. As such it forms a northerly bypass to Chester and a shorter route between the North West and North Wales than the A55. The road is dualled west of the M56. There is roundabout with the A540 and at Dunkirk at the western terminus of the M56. East of the junction the road is single carriageway and crosses the A41 by way of a roundabout at Backford Cross. The A5117 intersects the M53 at Junction 10. This junction is just east of Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet. The road then continues almost parallel to the M56, which it intersects at Junction 14, at which there is a Motorway service area. The road then continues south east to terminate where it joins the A56 at Helsby. Current construction The upgrading of the A5117 on a section west of the M56 motorway, Dunkirk roundabout to Sealand was started in 2006. It is regularly congested but the improvement will see the road converted to grade separated 2-lane dual carriageway standard . The Government decided that a motorway standard M56 extension would be too environmentally damaging, and instead opted for a route utilising part of the existing road without widening works, whilst providing off-line bypasses for all of the at-grade junctions. The improvements will tie into recently completed works over the Welsh border which upgraded the A550 to a standard similar to that of motorways. Work started in late 2006 for completion by mid 2008. Points of interest Travelling west the sandstone cliff above Helsby appears as the profile of a man's face. The road passes the Stanlow Refinery which burns off refinery gases. History The road was built in the 1930s and known as the \\"Shotwick - Helsby Bypass\\". It formed a link between Manchester, the North West and North Wales via the Queensferry Lifting bridge, the A550 and the A494, to join the A55 at Ewloe. Some sections were constructed in concrete. The road was lined for much of its length with poplar trees. This original tree lined boulevard layout is still in evidence on the section adjacent to Stanlow Refinery. In the 1960s it was marked out as a single carriageway 3-lane road. The middle lane was known as the \\"suicide\\" lane due to overtaking vehicles from each direction heading towards each other at speed. Vehicles in the nearside lanes would experience an up and down vertical motion due to the need for \\"summit and valley\\" drainage on this otherwise flat section of road.

Its population at the 2010 census was 241. The village is a summer vacation spot on Melvin Bay of Lake Winnipesaukee. Geography Melvin Village is in the western part of the town of Tuftonboro, where the Melvin River enters Lake Winnipesaukee. Running through the center is New Hampshire Route 109, which leads southeast to Wolfeboro and northwest to Moultonborough. The village is little changed over the last century. Most of the buildings remain and there are few new ones. The most significant change is that there is virtually no commercial activity. As recently as 1950 there were two general stores and two gas stations, all of which are now gone. The village was a stop in William Least Heat-Moon's book, Blue Highways. It has a marina and there are also compounds of cottages and lakeside homes. Merrymount Landing is the only remaining mail boat stop in the northeast corner of the lake. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Melvin Village CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.54%, are water. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 241 people, 115 households, and 76 families residing in the CDP. There were 274 housing units, of which 159, or 58.0%, were vacant. 149 of the vacant units were for seasonal or recreational use. The racial makeup of the CDP was 99.2% white and 0.8% Asian. None of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Of the 115 households in the CDP, 20.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.8% were headed by married couples living together, 7.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.9% were non-families. 26.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.3% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.10, and the average family size was 2.50. 15.8% of residents in the CDP were under the age of 18, 3.3% were from age 18 to 24, 14.9% were from 25 to 44, 36.5% were from 45 to 64, and 29.5% were 65 years of age or older.

A timing diagram can contain many rows, usually one of them being the clock. It is a tool that is commonly used in digital electronics, hardware debugging, and digital communications. Besides providing an overall description of the timing relationships, the digital timing diagram can help find and diagnose digital logic hazards. Diagram convention Most timing diagrams use the following conventions: * Higher value is a logic one * Lower value is a logic zero * A slot showing a high and low is an either or (such as on a data line) * A Z indicates high impedance * A greyed out slot is a don't-care or indeterminate. Example: SPI bus timing A timing diagram for the Serial Peripheral Interface Bus The timing diagram example on the right describes the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Bus. Most SPI master nodes have the ability to set the clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA) with respect to the data. This timing diagram shows the clock for both values of CPOL and the values for the two data lines (MISO & MOSI) for each value of CPHA. Note that when CPHA=1 then the data is delayed by one-half clock cycle. SPI operates in the following way: * The master determines an appropriate CPOL & CPHA value * The master pulls down the slave select (SS) line for a specific slave chip * The master clocks SCK at a specific frequency * During each of the 8 clock cycles the transfer is full duplex: ** The master writes on the MOSI line and reads the MISO line ** The slave writes on the MISO line and reads the MOSI line * When finished the master can continue with another byte transfer or pull SS high to end the transfer When a slave's SS line is high then both of its MISO and MOSI line should be high impedance so to avoid disrupting a transfer to a different slave. Prior to SS being pulled low, the MISO & MOSI lines are indicated with a \\"z\\" for high impedance. Also, prior to the SS being pulled low the \\"cycle #\\" row is meaningless and is shown greyed- out. Note that for CPHA=1 the MISO & MOSI lines are undefined until after the first clock edge and are also shown greyed-out before that.

Career  At secondary school in Recklinghausen, Hape Kerkeling and some fellow students formed a band (Gesundfutter, meaning: health fodder) and published a record (Hawaii). Kerkeling started his career as a comedian in radio, working for various German broadcasting companies, such as WDR and BR. The real breakthrough came in 1984/85 when, still aged only 19, Kerkeling got a role in the K√§nguru [sic] television comedy show (the German word for kangaroo deliberately spelt without an \\"h\\" at the end although this broke the spelling rules at that time). The best-known character in this show was the little boy Hannilein, played by Kerkeling, an irritating child with red hair in a pudding-basin style, dungarees and sitting on giant-sized chairs, who commented on the world of adults. Later came guest appearances and sketches on the Radio Bremen show Extratour. Then in 1989 Kerkeling started up his own comedy TV show, Total Normal (Totally Normal) along with pianist Achim Hagemann. This show, a satirical spoof on prime-time TV-Shows, had a totally new format and was awarded several television prizes such as the Goldene Kamera, the Adolf- Grimme-Preis and the Bayerischer Fernsehpreis. On the show, Kerkeling made television history on 25 April 1991 when he dressed up as Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands on a state visit to Berlin and almost managed to get into Schloss Bellevue to meet the President of Germany for lunch. The satirical song from this show, Das ganze Leben ist ein Quiz (All life is a quiz) made it into the German pop charts. On 10 December 1991, in a German television talkshow, the filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim revealed that Kerkeling, among others, was gay. Kerkeling's comment on the ensuing fuss (mostly in the gutter press) was that while anyone of a more sensitive nature than him would probably have climbed into the bath with a hairdryer, he could not see the point: they would be dragging another poor soul through the dirt the next day anyway. In 1992 Kerkeling's first film came out: ', which he directed and starred in, as well as helping to write the script. In 1992 Kerkeling turned down an offer by the big public broadcasting company ZDF to work on the immensely popular prime- time show Wetten, dass..? and instead, without his previous partner Hagemann, moved to the independent television sector with the show Cheese. This was similar in concept to Total Normal and viewing figures were relatively high; still this is considered as his first flop. In the second half of the 90s, Kerkeling worked once more for ARD, presenting the show Warmumsherz (Heartwarming), and filmed several television films (Club Las Piranjas (1995), Willi und die Windzors, 1996; Die Oma ist tot, 1997). In 1999 Kerkeling returned to success with his Sat.1 show Dar√ºber lacht die Welt (What makes the world laugh). He also presented the yearly fundraising gala for the German AIDS fund Deutsche AIDS-Hilfe. In 2003 he was awarded the Deutscher Fernsehpreis (German Television Prize) in the category Best Entertainment Presenter. In January 2004 Kerkeling made another film entitled Samba in Mettmann, which is set in Mettmann in North Rhine Westphalia. In May 2004, and a year later in May 2005, he presented the Gro√üer Deutsch-Test (a national test show for German grammar and spelling) and in October 2004 the Gro√üer Deutschlandtest (a test about people's knowledge of Germany). In April and May 2006 he presented the live TV show Let's Dance, the German version of Strictly Come Dancing/Dancing with the Stars, with Nazan Eckes. German broadcaster ZDF started the production of Kerkeling's Ein Mann, ein Fjord! (A Man, A Fjord!) in May 2008, directed by Angelo Colagrossi and written by Kerkeling, Angelo Colagrossi and Angelina Maccarone. Starring J√ºrgen Tarrach, Anneke Kim Sarnau, Matthias Brandt and Horst Krause the film portrays Kerkeling as Horst Schl√§mmer, Uschi Blum and Gisela. The movie premiered on 21 January 2009, on ZDF.Ein Mann, ein Fjord!, zdf.de In a survey by the television station Kabel 1 in 2005, Kerkeling made it into the top ten favourite faces on German television; the only other two presenters were G√ºnther Jauch and Thomas Gottschalk. In 2001 Kerkeling went on a pilgrimage, following the Way of St James for to Santiago de Compostela. In June 2006 his book Ich bin dann mal weg (I'm off for a bit, then), his diary of this pilgrimage, was top of the Spiegel magazine non-fiction bestseller list. By May 2008 it had sold 3 million copies.So wanderte Hape Kerkeling zum Bestseller, die Welt It appeared in English in 2009 with the title I'm Off Then: Losing and Finding Myself on the Camino De Santiago. It has also been translated into French, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Latvian, Spanish, and Chinese. Hape Kerkeling lives with his life partner and co-author Angelo Colagrossi in Berlin. Colagrossi wrote a large number of texts and sketches for Total Normal and other shows, and co- directed the films Kein Pardon, Willi und die Windzors, Die Oma ist tot, Samba in Mettmann and Ein Mann, ein Fjord!. In March 2011 Kerkeling announced that he and Colagrossi were getting a divorce.Kerkeling trennt sich-Isch bin solo, Spiegel Online on 6 March 2011. Since spring 2005 Kerkeling has presented the show Hape trifft! (which is ambiguous in the German language and may be translated as Hape hits the spot! or Hape meets!) show, produced by G√ºnther Jauch's production team i&u; TV on RTL. In 2013 Hape Kerkeling spoke and sang the German version of Olaf, a snowman from the new Disney movie Frozen. A film about his childhood was released in 2018, titled Der Junge muss an die frische Luft, based on his semi-autographic book, with the main character played by Julius Weckauf. Characters  Horst Schl√§mmer  Horst Schl√§mmer is one of Kerkeling's current characters (and the most successful), the deputy editor of the fictitious newspaper Grevenbroicher Tagblatt. His motto is to \\"get up close and ask tough questions\\". Dressed in a grey trenchcoat and with a small black manbag on his arm, he holds interviews at real events such as the Bundestag elections. Schl√§mmer speaks to interviewees in an overfamiliar manner, using du for you rather than the polite Sie, and addressing them as Sch√§tzelein (sweetheart). He seems to think he is a sex symbol, attempting to kiss female interviewees despite his loose false teeth. To impress women, he boasts that he earns three thousand (euro) net a month. On the ARD's Harald Schmidt show, Kerkeling explained his methods. Before a Schl√§mmer interview, he said, he pours a few drops of strong liquor over his coat, to give the interviewee the impression he or she is being interviewed by a real reporter, but with an alcohol problem, prompting a real response. The single Sch√§tzelein came out at the start of 2006, including the songs Sch√§tzelein and Meine letzte Zigarette (My last cigarette). In May 2006 Schl√§mmer appeared on Wer wird Million√§r (the German Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?) as a celebrity candidate, and became the first person to persuade G√ºnther Jauch, the presenter of Wer wird Million√§r, into the contestant's seat. The two made 500,000 euro for a good cause (German AIDS Foundation). In 2007 a computer game \\"Weisse Bescheid?!\\", based on Horst Schl√§mmer, was released. In 2009 Kerkeling announced a mockumentary about Horst Schl√§mmer running for German Chancellor. It was scheduled to be released to cinemas in Germany shortly before the German federal election of 2009. According to a BBC piece, Horst Schl√§mmer would receive 18% of the German vote due partly to his Obama inspired slogan, \\"Yes weekend\\".  Hannilein  Kerkeling, in Kerkelings Kinderstunde (Kerkelings children's hour), as a cheeky child of preschool age named Hannilein, with red tousled hair and a bib overall, sits on oversized chairs and comments on the adult world. Evje van Dampen Is a female Dutch relationship counselor who meets various German celebrities (such as G√ºnther Jauch or Udo J√ºrgens).  Siggi Schw√§bli  Siegfried (Siggi) Schw√§bli is a character who first appeared in 1990 in some episodes of Total Normal. Slow-witted, short-sighted and with glasses made of plastic blocks, Siggi constantly puts his foot in it and often has no idea what is going on. At the Cannstatter Volksfest festival in Stuttgart, for example, he went on the ghost train with Barbara Sch√∂neberger, a TV host, and almost passed out with fear.  Gisela  Gisela has recently been discovered by Horst Schlaemmer to act in commercials for Krueger Coffee. She has been happily married to her husband, Wolfgang since 1983.  Uschi Blum  Kerkeling performs as a parody of an overweight, aging German Schlager music singer with streaky success and ridiculous lyrics in her songs.

The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 29 in the Herkimer County hamlet of Salisbury Center. Its eastern end is at another junction with NY 29 about to the east near the Fulton County hamlet of Vail Mills. NY 29A enters Gloversville via Rose Street and continues through downtown on Fulton Street. Originally, NY 29A turned right on Saratoga Boulevard and continued via Steele Avenue Extension to NY 29 about away. Later, NY 29A was taken off Saratoga Boulevard, and was concurrent with NY 30A to its crossing with Steele Avenue Extension, following Steele Avenue Extension after that. In 1980, NY 29A was removed from Steele Avenue Extension as well as the concurrency with NY 30A. Instead, it continued east on Turkey Farm Road, which meant no turns, to its present terminus at NY 29 west of Vail Mills. Route description NY 29A begins at a fork from NY 29 in the hamlet of Salisbury Center (in the town of Salisbury). NY 29A proceeds east through the residential hamlet, turning northeastward at a junction with Emmonsburg Road (unsigned County Route 130 (CR 130)). Here, the route leaves Sailsbury Center and proceeds through the dense woods of Herkimer County. Paralleling CR 130 from a distance, NY 29A begins paralleling East Canada Creek before turning northeast into the hamlet of Stratford, crossing into the Adirondack Park. At the junction with Cemetery Road in Stratford, NY 29A turns eastward and crosses over the East Canada Creek and into Fulton County. Caroga Lake Now in the town of Stratford, NY 29A continues east through the woods of the Adirondack Park, becoming a two- lane woods road. This retains itself for several miles, making a short stint to the southeast and northeast near Pleasant Lake. After Pleasant Lake, the route returns to its general west-east configuration, continuing through the dense woods of the Adirondack Park. The route passes south of Nine Corner Lake and crosses into the town of Caroga, where it reaches a junction with NY 10 at the southern end of Pine Lake. NY 10 and NY 29A become concurrent through Caroga, turning southward through the park. At the junction with Point Breeze Road, the routes turn southeast along Canada Lake, entering the namesake hamlet of Canada Lake. Running southeast along the eastern shores of Canada Lake, NY 10 and NY 29A remain a two-lane park roadway, bypassing the many lakeside residences along the shore. Just south of Irving Pond Road, the routes cross into the hamlet of Wheelerville, where it passes the Nick Stoner Municipal Golf Course. and soon crosses a junction with CR 112 and CR 111 (London Bridge Road). Just after CR 111, the routes turn southeast into the hamlet of Caroga Lake, running close to the shore of West Caroga Lake. Through the hamlet, the routes become the main street, forking in the center, with NY 10 turning southwest and NY 29A continuing southeast out of Caroga Lake. Continuing through the park, NY 29A soon passes East Caroga Lake, and past multiple residences along the highway and on multiple side streets. Continuing southeast through the town of Caroga, NY 29A passes a junction with CR 137 (Beech Ridge Road). The route soon returns to the dense woods of the Adirondack Park, passing nearby Peck Lake. Just south of Peck Lake, NY 29A crosses out of the Adirondack Park and into the town of Johnstown. Passing Mud Lake, the route remains through dense woods, but passing more residences as it continues southeast. NY 29A soon reaches the hamlet of Meco, where it crosses CR 122 and CR 101 intersect. Turning east out of Meco, the surroundings of NY 29A change to more residences as the route approaches the city of Gloversville. NY 29A east at the junction with NY 30A in Johnstown Entering Gloversville, NY 29A gains the moniker of Rose Street until the junction with Fulton, where it turns eastward. NY 29A continues onto West Fulton Street, becoming the main west-east road through Gloversville, passing multiple businesses. The route crosses over Cayadutta Creek, soon entering downtown Gloversville, where it meets the southern terminus of NY 309 (Bleecker Street) and soon changes to East Fulton Street. Continuing east along East Fulton, NY 29A becomes a two-lane commercial street, soon passing the northern end of Prospect Hill Cemetery. After the cemetery, the route becomes residential in nature, soon leaving the city for the town of Johnstown once again. Almost immediately after crossing the town line, NY 29A meets an at-grade intersection with NY 30A in the hamlet of Berkshire. Now known as Turkey Farm Road, NY 29A continues southeast through Johnstown, becoming a two-lane residential street into the hamlet of Progress. After Progress, the route becomes more rural, soon crossing into the town of Mayfield. At the junction with Sandhill Road, the route re-enters dense woods and turns southeast through Mayfield, reaching a junction with NY 29 in front of the Holland Meadows Golf Course. This junction marks the eastern terminus of NY 29A in the town of Broadalbin. History NY 29A was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The route initially followed its current alignment from Salisbury to downtown Gloversville, where it turned southeast to follow Saratoga Boulevard and Steele Avenue Extension to NY 29 in the town of Johnstown. When the NY 30A arterial was completed in the mid-1950s, NY 29A was rerouted to remain on East Fulton Street to the Arterial, where it turned south and overlapped NY 30A to its intersection with the original route. Reference markers used along NY 920J On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of Turkey Farm Road from the Gloversville city line to NY 29 just west of Vail Mills was transferred from Fulton County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. NY 29A was realigned to follow the new state highway‚Äîreaching NY 29 farther east than before‚Äîwhile the portion of its former routing on Steele Avenue Extension south of the Gloversville city line became NY 920J, an unsigned reference route in length. Reference markers along NY 920J still read \\"29A\\" for its former designation. Future NYSDOT has explicitly reserved the NY 435 designation as a replacement for the section of NY 29A between NY 10 and NY 30A. No timetable has been established for the redesignation.

It is named after Grigori N. Milstein who first published the method in 1974. Description Consider the autonomous It≈ç stochastic differential equation: :\\\\mathrm{d} X_t = a(X_t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t + b(X_t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} W_t with initial condition X_{0} = x_{0}, where W_{t} stands for the Wiener process, and suppose that we wish to solve this SDE on some interval of time [0,T]. Then the Milstein approximation to the true solution X is the Markov chain Y defined as follows: * partition the interval [0,T] into N equal subintervals of width \\\\Delta t>0: :0 = \\\\tau_0 < \\\\tau_1 < \\\\dots < \\\\tau_N = T\\\\text{ with }\\\\tau_n:=n\\\\Delta t\\\\text{ and }\\\\Delta t = \\\\frac{T}{N} * set Y_0 = x_0; * recursively define Y_n for 1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq N by: :Y_{n + 1} = Y_n + a(Y_n) \\\\Delta t + b(Y_n) \\\\Delta W_n + \\\\frac{1}{2} b(Y_n) b'(Y_n) \\\\left( (\\\\Delta W_n)^2 - \\\\Delta t \\\\right) where b' denotes the derivative of b(x) with respect to x and: :\\\\Delta W_n = W_{\\\\tau_{n + 1}} - W_{\\\\tau_n} are independent and identically distributed normal random variables with expected value zero and variance \\\\Delta t. Then Y_n will approximate X_{\\\\tau_n} for 0 \\\\leq n \\\\leq N, and increasing N will yield a better approximation. Note that when b'(Y_n) = 0 , i.e. the diffusion term does not depend on X_{t} , this method is equivalent to the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method. The Milstein scheme has both weak and strong order of convergence, \\\\Delta t, which is superior to the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method, which in turn has the same weak order of convergence, \\\\Delta t, but inferior strong order of convergence, \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta t}.V.

Service Golgotha (Crucifixion icon), Orthodox cathedral in Vilnius. The lity tray (memorial stand) is at lower right, where the memorial services are celebrated. The stand has holders for the faithful to place candles. In the Eastern Church, the various prayers for the departed have as their purpose praying for the repose of the departed, comforting the living, and reminding the living of their own mortality and the brevity of this earthly life. For this reason, memorial services have an air of penitence about them.For instance, the Panikhida does not have the chanting of \\"God is the Lord...\\" as the Moleben does; but instead uses, as at matins on Saturdays when the dead are remembered, the \\"Alleluia\\" of the Dead in place of \\"God is the Lord\\". They tend to be served more frequently during the four fasting seasons.Great Lent, Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast and Dormition Fast If the service is for an individual, it is often held at the deceased's graveside. If it is a general commemoration of all the departed, or if the individual's grave is not close by, the service is held in a church, in front of a special small, free- standing \\"memorial table\\", to which is attached an upright crucifix and with a candelabra for the faithful to put lighted candles. The deacon (or, if there is no deacon, the priest) swings the censer throughout almost the entire service, while all stand holding lighted candles. Near the end of the service, during the final troparia, all, either extinguish their candles, or place them in a candle holder by the memorial table. Each candle symbolizes the individual soul, which, as it were, each person holds in his own hand. The extinguishing (or giving up) of the candle, at the end of the service, symbolizes the fact that each person will have to surrender his soul, at the end of his life. The service is composed of Psalms, ektenias (litanies), hymns and prayers. In its outline it follows the general order of MatinsFrom this comes the Greek name parastas which refers to standing all night in vigil, which in the early days was what literally took place. and is, in effect, a truncated funeral service. Some of the most notable portions of the service are the Kontakion of the DepartedKontakion of the Departed: \\"With the saints give rest, O Christ, to the soul(s) of Thy servant(s), where there is neither sickness, nor sorrow, nor sighing, but life everlasting. and the final singing of \\"Memory Eternal\\" (Slavonic: Vyechnaya Pamyat). The memorial service is most frequently served at the end of the Divine Liturgy; however, it may also be served after Vespers, Matins, or as a separate service by itself. If the service is held separately, there are readings from the Pauline epistles and the Gospels, which are assigned by the day of the week; no readings, however, are assigned to Sunday because Sunday should emphasize the resurrection of Christ rather than the departed. Koliva A dish of Koliva made from wheat and raisins, which is traditionally used during Orthodox memorial services. For the memorial service, koliva (a ritual food of boiled wheat) is often prepared and is placed in front of the memorial table or an icon of Christ. Afterwards, it is blessed by the priest, who sprinkles it with holy water. in the Bulgarian Church it is also customary for the priest to pour wine on the koliva and on the grave The koliva is then taken to the refectory and is served to all those who attended the service. Occasions After an Orthodox Christian dies there are special \\"Prayers for the Departure of the Soul\\" that are said by the priest. Then the family or friends of the departed will wash and dress the body and it is placed in the casket after which a special expanded memorial service called the First Panikhida is celebrated, following which the reading of the Psalteror the Gospels if the departed be a priest commences and continues uninterrupted until the funeral. Traditionally, in addition to the service on the day of death, the memorial service is performed at the request of the relatives of an individual departed person on the following occasions: *Third day after deathIn calculating the number of days, the actual day of death is counted as the first day. According to St. Macarius the Great, the reason for these days is as follows: from the third day to the ninth day after death, the departed is soul is shown the mansions of Paradise (the funeral is normally performed on the third day); from the ninth to the fortieth days, the soul is shown the torments of hell; and on the fortieth day, the soul stands before the throne of God to undergo the Particular Judgement and is assigned the place where it will await the Second Coming. For this reason, the fortieth day is considered to be the most important. In some traditions, the semi-anniversary (six months) is also commemorated. *Ninth day *Fortieth day *Three months *Six months *First anniversary of death *Third anniversary (some will request a memorial every year on the anniversary of death) It is also served on the numerous Soul Saturdays throughout the year.Saturday is generally a day dedicated to prayer for the departed, because Christ lay dead in the Tomb on a Saturday. In some monasteries and large churches, it is customary to serve a Panikhida on every Saturday, unless a major feast occurs on that day. On these days, not only is the memorial service served, but there are also special propers at Vespers, Matins, and the Divine Liturgy. These days of general memorials are: *Meatfare Saturday (two Saturdays before Great Lent begins)‚Äîin some traditions families and friends will offer Panikhidas for their loved ones during the preceding week, culminating in the general commemoration on Saturday *The second Saturday of Great Lent *The third Saturday of Great Lent *The fourth Saturday of Great Lent *In the Russian tradition, Radonitsa--Tuesday following Thomas Sunday; i.e., the second Tuesday after Pascha (Easter)Because of the sacredness of the days, The celebration of memorial services is forbidden during Holy Week and Bright Week. *The Saturday before Pentecost‚Äîin some traditions families and friends will offer Panikhidas for their loved ones during the preceding week, culminating in the general commemoration on Saturday *In the Russian tradition, Demetrius Saturday (the Saturday closest to the feast of Saint Demetrius, October 26), commemorating the soldiers who fell in the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), under the leadership of St. Demetrius of the Don. \\"Orthodox Church in America -- Lives of the Saints\\", Retrieved 2013-06-29 Demetrius Saturday is also observed in other Slavic churches, as well as among the Slavic speakers of northern Greece. The celebration of memorial services is forbidden from Holy Thursday through Bright Week and on all Sundays throughout the year. Lity A very abbreviated form of the memorial service is called the Lity (or Liti or Litia), from the Greek ŒªŒπœÑ·Ω¥ œÑŒµŒªŒµœÑŒÆ, litƒì teletƒì, i.e. a plain ceremony, or ŒªŒπœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºœåœÉœÖŒΩŒøŒΩ, liton mnƒìmosynon, i.e. a plain mnemosynon; it consists only of the concluding portion of the regular memorial service.

It was nominated for four Guldbagge Awards including Best Film as well as being selected as Sweden's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards. Plot The film presents five childhood friends in their twenties who have grown up together in the town Falkenberg. The movie chronicles what they call \\"their last summer\\" in the town, faced with the prospect that sooner or later they have to move up to Gothenburg. Their lives in Falkenberg currently circle around nothing and each other: Holger, who seems to be the central figure of the five, faces fears of moving away from his hometown and becoming clich√©d; his brother John, grumpy and lazy; Jesper, the only member of the group who already attempted to move away from the town, but ends up coming back nevertheless; J√∂rgen, who is in the process of setting up a catering business, but without much prospect; and David, the sensitive loner and Holger's best friend, whose diary serves as a narration for the story. The film offers vignettes of the seemingly empty lives of the five: wandering in nature, dealing with the parental expectations, swimming in the sea and burglarizing homes (although more as a pastime activity opposed to a financial source). At the climax of the movie, David wraps up his diary and mails it off to Holger. He then packs up a shotgun, goes out to the forest and commits suicide. Holger is initially distraught, but eventually, as David predicted in his diary, \\"life goes on\\" and the remaining friends settle back into their former routine of killing time and facing their inevitable prospects.

The Jewish Ghetto Police or Jewish Police Service ( or J√ºdischer Ordnungsdienst), also called the Jewish Police by Jews, were auxiliary police units organized within the Nazi ghettos by local Judenrat (Jewish councils). Overview Members of the Jewish Police did not usually have official uniforms, often wearing just an identifying armband, a hat, and a badge, and were not allowed to carry firearms, although they did carry batons. In ghettos where the Judenrat was resistant to German orders, the Jewish police were often used (as reportedly in Lutsk) to control or replace the council. One of the largest Jewish police units was to be found in the Warsaw Ghetto, where the J√ºdischer Ordnungsdienst numbered about 2,500.

Jeremiah Curtin (6 September 1835 ‚Äì 14 December 1906) was an American ethnographer, folklorist, and translator. Curtin had an abiding interest in languages and was conversant with several. From 1883 to 1891 he was employed by the Bureau of American Ethnology as a field researcher documenting the customs and mythologies of various Native American tribes. He and his wife, Alma Cardell Curtin, traveled extensively, collecting ethnological information, from the Modocs of the Pacific Northwest to the Buryats of Siberia. They made several trips to Ireland, visited the Aran Islands, and, with the aid of interpreters, collected folklore in southwest Munster and other Gaelic-speaking regions. Curtin compiled one of the first accurate collections of Irish folk material, and was an important source for W. B. Yeats. Curtin is known for several collections of Irish folktales. He also translated into English Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis and other novels and stories by the Pole. Life Born in Detroit, Michigan,Cheryl L. Collins (1 April 2008), \\"Behind the Curtin\\".

Clay, Minister to the Russian court. During his time in Russia, Curtin became friends with Konstantin Pobedonostsev, professor of law at Moscow State University. He also visited Czechoslovakia and the Caucasus, and studied Slavic languages. While continuing to improve his Russian language skills, he also studied Czech, Polish, Bohemian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Hungarian, and Turkish.Kroeber, Karl (2002) \\"Introduction\\", Curtin, Jeremiah Creation Myths of Primitive America, ABC-CLIO, p. ix. . Curtin returned to the United States in 1868 for a brief visit. Clay assumed that around this time Curtin made some comments to William H. Seward that cost Clay an appointment as Secretary of War. Clay referred to Curtin as a \\"Jesuit Irishman\\". Upon his return to the United States, Curtin lectured on Russia and the Caucasus. In 1872 he married Alma M. Cardell. Mrs. Cardell acted as his secretary. In 1883 Curtin was employed by the Bureau of American Ethnology as a field worker. His specialties were his work with American Indian languages and Slavic languages. In 1900, Curtin travelled to Siberia, which resulted in the book A Journey in Southern Siberia (published posthumously). The first part of the book is a travelogue; the last two-thirds is a record of the mythology of the Buryat people.Curtin, Jeremiah (1909) A Journey in Southern Siberia, Boston, Little, Brown, and Company. via Sacred Texts.

Irish folklore Curtin visited Ireland on five occasions between 1871 and 1893, where he collected folkloric material in southwest Munster, the Aran Islands, and other Irish language regions with the help of interpreters. From this work he produced Myths and Folklore of Ireland (1890), an important source for folk material used by Yeats; Hero Tales of Ireland (1894); and Tales of the Fairies and Ghost World (1895).

In addition to publishing collections of fairy tales and folklore and writings about his travels, Curtin translated a number of volumes by Henryk Sienkiewicz, including his Trilogy set in the 17th- century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a couple of volumes on contemporary Poland, and, most famously and profitably, Quo Vadis (1897). In 1900 Curtin translated The Teutonic Knights by Sienkiewicz, the author's major historic novel about the Battle of Grunwald and its background. He also published an English version of Boles≈Çaw Prus' only historical novel, Pharaoh, under the title The Pharaoh and the Priest (1902). Having both Polish and Russian interests, Curtin scrupulously avoided publicly favoring either people in their historic neighbors' quarrels (particularly since the Russian Empire had been in occupation of a third of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including Warsaw, since the latter part of the 18th century). Sienkiewicz Curtin (left) with Henryk Sienkiewicz, author of Quo Vadis Henryk Sienkiewicz Curtin began translating Henryk Sienkiewicz's historical novel With Fire and Sword in 1888 at age fifty. Subsequently, he rendered the other two volumes of the author's Trilogy, other works by Sienkiewicz, and in 1897 his Quo Vadis, \\"[t]he handsome income ... from [whose] sale ... gave him ... financial independence ...\\" and set the publisher, Little, Brown and Company, on its feet. Sienkiewicz himself appears to have been short-changed in his part of the profits from the translation of the best-selling Quo Vadis. In 1897, Curtin's first meeting with Sienkiewicz, like his earlier first contact with the latter's writings, came about by sheer chance, in a hotel dining room at the Swiss resort of Ragatz. For the next nine years, until Curtin's death in 1906, the two men would be in continual contact through correspondence and personal meetings. Harold B. Segel writes about Curtin's translations of works by Henryk Sienkiewicz: Segel cites a series of mistranslations perpetrated by Curtin due to his carelessness, uncritical reliance on dictionaries, and ignorance of Polish idiom, culture, history and language. Among the more striking is the rendering, in The Deluge, of \\"Czo≈Çem\\" (\\"Greetings!\\"‚Äîa greeting still used by Poles) \\"literally\\" as \\"With the forehead!\\" According to Segel, the greatest weakness of Curtin's translations is their literalness. \\"Despite the fact that the translator himself possessed no impressive literary talent, greater attention to matters of style would have eliminated many of the infelicities and made for less stilted translation. But Curtin worked hastily ... [C]ritics ... could only surmise that, in his fidelity to the letter of the original rather than to its spirit, Curtin presented a duller, less colorful Sienkiewicz\\". Contemporary critics were dismayed at Curtin's gratuitous, outlandish modifications of the spellings of Polish proper names and other terms, and at his failure to provide adequate annotations. Both Bozena Shallcross and Jan Rybicki say that, at least in the case of some early translations, that Curtin's work may have been based on Russian translations rather than the Polish originals.Rybicki, Jan (2010), \\"The Translator's Wife's Traces: Alma Cardell Curtin and Jeremiah Curtin\\", Przek≈Çadaniec. A Journal of Literary Translation 24: 89‚Äì109 Sienkiewicz himself, who had spent time in America and knew the English language, wrote to the translator: \\"I have read with diligent attention all the volumes of my works sent me (American Edition). I understand how great the difficulties were which you had to overcome, especially in translating the historical novels, the language of which is somewhat archaic in character. I admire not only the sincere conscientiousness and accuracy, but also the skill, with which you did the work. Your countrymen will establish your merit better than I; as to me, I can only desire that you and no one else should translate all that I write. With respect and friendship, HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ\\". The blurb page postfaced to the 1898 Little, Brown and Co. edition of Quo Vadis includes high praise of Curtin's translations by reviewers writing in the Chicago Mail, Portland Advertiser, Chicago Evening Post, Literary World, Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph, Providence Journal, Brooklyn Eagle, Detroit Tribune, Boston Times, Boston Saturday Evening Gazette, Boston Courier, Cleveland Plain Dealer, New York Times, Boston Home Journal, Review of Reviews, Boston Herald, and several other newspapers. Prus Boles≈Çaw Prus In 1897, during a Warsaw visit, Curtin learned from Wolff, of Gebethner and Wolff, Sienkiewicz's Polish publishers, that the Polish journalist and novelist Boles≈Çaw Prus, an acquaintance of Sienkiewicz, was as good a writer, and that none of Sienkiewicz's works excelled Prus' novel Pharaoh. Curtin read Pharaoh, enjoyed it and decided to translate it in the future. During an 1898 Warsaw visit, Curtin began translating Prus' Pharaoh. Polish friends had urged him to translate it, and he had himself found it \\"a powerful novel, well conceived and skillfully executed\\"; he declared its author a \\"deep and independent thinker.\\" In September 1899, again in Warsaw‚Äîwhere, as often happened, Sienkiewicz was away‚ÄîCurtin went ahead with his translation of Prus' historical novel. Wolff urged him to continue with Prus, calling him profounder than Sienkiewicz. During another Warsaw visit, in early 1900, while again waiting for Sienkiewicz to return from abroad, Curtin called on Prus. Christopher Kasparek says that, if anything, Curtin did still worse by Sienkiewicz's \\"profounder\\" compatriot, Boles≈Çaw Prus. Prus' historical novel Pharaoh appears, in Curtin's version, as The Pharaoh and the Priest by \\"Alexander Glovatski.\\" Why the author's pen name was dropped in favor of a transliterated and distorted version of his private name, is not explained. Concerning the change of title, Curtin states laconically, at the end (p. viii) of his \\"Prefatory Remarks\\" (plagiarized from Prus' \\"Introduction\\", which also appears in the book), that \\"The title of this volume has been changed from 'The Pharaoh' to 'The Pharaoh and the Priest,' at the wish of the author.\\" Curtin's English version of the novel is incomplete, lacking the striking Epilog that closes the novel's sixty-seven chapters. If in Sienkiewicz's Rodzina Po≈Çanieckich Curtin mindlessly rendered \\"Monachium\\" (Polish for \\"Munich\\") as \\"Monachium\\" (which is meaningless in English), in Prus' Pharaoh (chapter 1) he renders \\"Zatoka Sebenicka\\" (\\"Bay of Sebennytos\\") equally mindlessly as \\"Bay of Sebenico\\". The pattern of using \\"thee's\\" and \\"thou's\\" continues unabated, and in this context is not so much evocative of antiquity, as simply irritating. Analysis The Memoirs of Jeremiah Curtin were published in 1940 by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin from a manuscript presented to the society by Curtin's niece, Mrs. Walter J. Seifert, who made assurance that the material was to be credited to Curtin himself, although dictated to Mrs. Curtin, and \\"[s]ometimes she rewrote his matter several times\\". \\"Introduction\\", Memoirs of Jeremiah Curtin, p. 1 In spite of this, Professor Michal Jacek Mikos has demonstrated that the so-called Memoirs of Jeremiah Curtin were written not by Curtin himself but by his wife Alma Cardell Curtin from extracts from her own diaries and letters to her family.Shallcross, Bozena. Review of W pogoni za Sienkiewiczem (\\"Chasing Sienkiewicz\\") by Michal Jacek Mikos, Sarmatian Review, XV:3, September 1995 Rybicki suggests that this raises the question as to the extent of Mrs. Curtin's contribution to the various works by her husband. While characterizing Curtin's translations as \\"mediocre\\", he suggests this might have been something of a collaborative effort by husband and wife. Rybicki compared the Memoirs with other Curtin works and found that the two books on the Mongols, written after Curtin's death, were stylistically more similar to the Memoirs, while the Native American mythologies are least like the Memoirs. Rybicki also found similarities in two translations: Przez stepy (\\"Lillian Morris\\") and Za chlebem (For Bread). Rybicki concludes, \\"the corrections she introduced could be quite far-reaching\\".

In which a woman (whose husband is either incapable of fatherhood or has died without having a child) would request and appoint a man for helping her bear a child. According to this tradition, the man who was appointed must be or would most likely be a revered person.  Clauses of Niyoga  There were various clauses associated with this process: #The woman would agree to this only for the sake of rightfully having a child but not sexual pleasure. #The child thus born would be considered the child of the husband-wife and not that of the appointed man. #The appointed man would not seek any paternal relationship or attachment to this child in the future. #To avoid misuse, a man was allowed a maximum of three times in his lifetime to be appointed in such a way. #The act will be seen as that of Dharma and while doing so, the man and the wife will have only Dharma in their mind and not passion nor lust. The man will do it as a help to the woman in the name of God, whereas the woman will accept it only to bear the child for herself and her husband.http://www.vedicpress.com/%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97/ #There will be no foreplay or contact of any kind with the upper body. The bodies of the female and male both are smeared with Ghee. There is a curtain between the male and the female so that none can see each other's face so that passion does not sneek into their minds. Only the legs of the female are kept uncovered. The male penetrates and ejaculates inside the woman and the process is completed. In the Mahabharata The epic Mahabharata describes one instance of niyoga. Queen Satyavati compels her son, sage Vyasa to perform niyoga with both the widows of her son Vichitravirya. The widows, Ambika and Ambalika and one of their maids, bear Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, respectively. Niyoga in Manusm·πõti In the Manusm·πõti, niyoga is described in IX.59-63, but the practice is also allowed in IX.64-68. This text (IX.167) describes the child born by niyoga as a kshetraja child of the husband-wife. Influences on art and culture Niyoga is the central issue of Anahat, a Marathi feature film directed by Amol Palekar. It was showcased at the International Film Festival of India 2003. The movie Eklavya: The Royal Guard has this practice as the central plot. The title character played by Amitabh Bachchan is torn between his duty and the emotions for his children begotten by the practice of niyoga. It is also portrayed in the 1989 film Oonch Neech Beech, where the character played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda, a sanyasi, is commanded by his teacher to perform niyoga.

It is located from the provincial capital city of Salamanca and has a population of only 55 people. The municipality covers an area of and it lies above sea level and the post code is 37659. History As most of the towns of the region, Las casas del Conde was born to history during the Christian repopulation, initiate in the days of Alfonso IX of Leon (1065‚Äì1109) into the hands of its son-in-law, the count Raimundo of Burgundy. As the wars of the Muslims continued threatening Christian Spain, Alfonso IX intensifies the repopulation activity and fortifies this zone, that also is border with the Kingdom of Castilla. So and as he comes off himself the origin of his name, soon the municipality happens to consist of the jurisdiction of the Count de Miranda del Casta√±ar, with the economic dependency that it supposes, due to the establishment of the feudal rents, applied to all the economic and materials goods of the neighbours. An important brake for the development of the town, until in 1757, the King grants the title from villa to the Houses of the Count, adjudging to him great part of the land of El Cabaco, Nava de Francia and el Casarito. This distribution originated the beginning of largu√≠simo lawsuit between the Houses and the Cabaco, in which they did not lack fights, attempts of murder and until the presence of soldiers, sent by the governor of the district, that lived in Ciudad Rodrigo. Some authors relate that those of Las Casas del Conde, but aggressive by their condition of ‚Äúserranos‚Äù, hurt, stabbed and until they left badly unemployed very serious to several neighbours of El Cabaco. In 1763 the cause in favour of the cabaque√±os was failed, that recovered their communal mounts. The complete acts of this lawsuit occupy nothing less than 1720 handwritten folio pages and the sentence is contained in another volume of 180 pages. Years before, the neighbours of the Houses also had serious disputes with Mogarraz, by the operation of the meadow of Santa Coloma. In 1672 there was a dead and several wounded in one fight, which triggered a time of greater understanding, and the following year signed the peace, paying Mogarraz 14300 real by the meadow. Nevertheless, the lawsuits continue throughout the years by problems of advantage of dry trees without fruit, pruning, coasts, you select, etc., giving rise to the sentence of the Real Chanciller√≠a de Valladolid, executory of the 28 of February 1738, in reference to the places of the mount of Pe√±alvo, already regulated in decrees of the third count of Miranda, and to the estates towards San Blas and the environs of the Francia river. Climate and natural surroundings Las Casas del Conde is located next to the Francia River, born in the mountain range with the same name, Sierra de Francia.

In humans, apocrine sweat glands are found only in certain locations of the body: the axillae (armpits), areola and nipples of the breast, ear canal, eyelids, wings of the nostril, perianal region, and some parts of the external genitalia. Modified apocrine glands include the ciliary glands in the eyelids; the ceruminous glands, which produce ear wax; and the mammary glands, which produce milk. The rest of the body is covered by eccrine sweat glands. Most non-primate mammals, however, have apocrine sweat glands over the greater part of their body. Domestic animals such as dogs and cats have apocrine glands at each hair follicle but eccrine glands only in foot pads and snout. Their apocrine glands, like those in humans, produce an odorless, oily, opaque secretion that gains its characteristic odor upon bacterial decomposition. Eccrine glands on their paws increase friction and prevent them from slipping when fleeing from danger. Structure The apocrine gland is made up of a glomerulus of secretory tubules and an excretory duct that opens into a hair follicle; on occasion, an excretory duct opens to the skin surface next to the hair. The gland is large and spongy, located in the subcutaneous fat deep in the dermis, and has a larger overall structure and lumen diameter than the eccrine sweat gland. The secretory tubules of apocrine glands are single layered, but unlike the eccrine secretory tubules, contain only a single type of ductal epithelial cell, varying in diameter according to their location, and sometimes branching off into multiple ducts. The tubules are wrapped in myoepithelial cells, which are more developed than in their eccrine gland counterparts. Sweating In hoofed animals and marsupials, apocrine glands act as the main thermoregulator, secreting watery sweat. For most mammals, however, apocrine sweat glands secrete an oily (and eventually smelly) compound that acts as a pheromone, territorial marker, and warning signal. Being sensitive to adrenaline, apocrine sweat glands are involved in emotional sweating in humans (induced by anxiety, stress, fear, sexual stimulation, and pain). In a five-month-old human fetus, apocrine glands are distributed all over the body; after a few weeks, they exist in only restricted areas, including the armpits and external genitalia. They are inactive until stimulated by hormonal changes in puberty. Mechanism The apocrine gland secretes an oily fluid with proteins, lipids, and steroids that is odorless before microbial activity. It appears on the skin surface mixed with sebum, as sebaceous glands open into the same hair follicle. Unlike eccrine sweat glands, which secrete continuously, the apocrine glands secrete in periodic spurts. Apocrine sweat glands were originally thought to use only apocrine secretion: vesicles pinch off from the secretory cells, then degrade in the secretory lumen, releasing their product. More recent research has also shown that merocrine secretion takes place. Myoepithelial cells form a smooth muscle lining around the secretory cells; when the muscles contract, they squeeze the secretory ducts and push out the accumulated fluid into the hair follicle. Sweat and sebum are mixed in the hair follicle and arrive mixed at the epidermal surface. The apocrine sweat is cloudy, viscous, initially odorless, and at a pH of 6‚Äì7.5. It contains water, protein, carbohydrate waste material, and NaCl. The sweat only attains its characteristic odor upon being degraded by bacteria, which releases volatile odor molecules. More bacteria (especially corynebacteria) leads to stronger odor. The presence of axillary hair also makes the odor even more pungent, as secretions, debris, keratin, and bacteria accumulate on the hairs. Prevalence Non-primate mammals usually have apocrine sweat glands over most of their bodies. Horses use them as a thermoregulatory device, as they are regulated by adrenaline and more widely distributed on equines than in other groups. Skunks, on the other hand, use the glands to release a secretion that acts as a powerful defense mechanism. The \\"axillary organs\\", limited regions with equal numbers of apocrine and eccrine sweat glands, only exist in humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees. In humans, the apocrine glands in this region are the most developed (with the most complex glomeruli). Men have more apocrine sweat glands than women in all axillary regions. There is currently no evidence that any sweat glands vary substantially by racial group, with most studies claiming to find variation being subject to methodological flaws.

In other mammals, they are relatively sparse, being found mainly on hairless areas such as foot pads. They reach their peak of development in humans, where they may number 200‚Äì400/cm¬≤ of skin surface.Bolognia, J., Jorizzo, J., & Schaffer, J. (2012). Dermatology (3rd ed., pp. 539-544). [Philadelphia]: Elsevier Saunders. They produce a clear, odorless substance, sweat, consisting primarily of water. Eccrine glands are composed of an intraepidermal spiral duct, the \\"acrosyringium\\"; a dermal duct, consisting of a straight and coiled portion; and a secretory tubule, coiled deep in the dermis or hypodermis. The eccrine gland opens out through the sweat pore. The coiled portion is formed by two concentric layer of columnar or cuboidal epithelial cells. The epithelial cells are interposed by the myoepithelial cells. Myoepithelial cells support the secretory epithelial cells. The duct of eccrine gland is formed by two layers of cuboidal epithelial cells. Eccrine glands are active in thermoregulation by providing cooling from water evaporation of sweat secreted by the glands on the body surface and emotional induced sweating (anxiety, fear, stress, and pain). The white sediment in otherwise colorless eccrine secretions is caused by evaporation that increases the concentration of salts. The odour from sweat is due to bacterial activity on the secretions of the apocrine sweat glands, a distinctly different type of sweat gland found in human skin. Eccrine glands are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, primarily by cholinergic fibers whose discharge is altered primarily by changes in deep body temperature (core temperature), but by adrenergic fibers as well. The glands on palms and soles do not respond to temperature but secrete at times of emotional stress. Secretion The secretion of eccrine glands is a sterile, dilute electrolyte solution with primary components of bicarbonate, potassium, and sodium chloride (NaCl), and other minor components such as glucose, pyruvate, lactate, cytokines, immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides (e.g., dermcidin), and many others. Relative to the plasma and extracellular fluid, the concentration of Na+ ions is much lower in sweat (~40 mM in sweat versus ~150 mM in plasma and extracellular fluid). Initially, within the eccrine glands, sweat has a high concentration of Na+ ions. The Na+ ions are re- absorbed into the tissue via the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) that are located on the apical membrane of the cells that form the eccrine gland ducts (see Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 of the reference). This re-uptake of Na+ ions reduces the loss of Na+ during the process of perspiration. Patients with the systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism syndrome who carry mutations in the ENaC subunit genes have salty sweat as they cannot reabsorb the salt in sweat. In these patients, Na+ ion concentrations can greatly increase (up to 180 mmol/L). In people who have hyperhidrosis, the sweat glands (eccrine glands in particular) overreact to stimuli and are just generally overactive, producing more sweat than normal. Similarly, cystic fibrosis patients also produce salty sweat. But in these cases, the problem is in the CFTR chloride transporter that is also located on the apical membrane of eccrine gland ducts. Dermicidin is a newly isolated antimicrobial peptide produced by the eccrine sweat glands.

It is a generalisation of the Runge‚ÄìKutta method for ordinary differential equations to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Importantly, the method does not involve knowing derivatives of the coefficient functions in the SDEs. Most basic scheme Consider the It≈ç diffusion X satisfying the following It≈ç stochastic differential equation :{{d} X_{t}} = a(X_{t}) \\\\, {d} t + b(X_{t}) \\\\, {d} W_{t}, with initial condition X_0=x_0, where W_t stands for the Wiener process, and suppose that we wish to solve this SDE on some interval of time [0,T]. Then the basic Runge‚ÄìKutta approximation to the true solution X is the Markov chain Y defined as follows:P. E. Kloeden and E. Platen. Numerical solution of stochastic differential equations, volume 23 of Applications of Mathematics.

The random variables \\\\Delta W_{n} are independent and identically distributed normal random variables with expected value zero and variance \\\\delta. This scheme has strong order 1, meaning that the approximation error of the actual solution at a fixed time scales with the time step \\\\delta. It has also weak order 1, meaning that the error on the statistics of the solution scales with the time step \\\\delta. See the references for complete and exact statements. The functions a and b can be time-varying without any complication. The method can be generalized to the case of several coupled equations; the principle is the same but the equations become longer. Variation of the Improved Euler is flexible A newer Runge‚ÄîKutta scheme also of strong order 1 straightforwardly reduces to the Improved Euler scheme for deterministic ODEs. A. J. Roberts. Modify the improved Euler scheme to integrate stochastic differential equations. , Oct 2012. Consider the vector stochastic process \\\\vec X(t)\\\\in \\\\mathbb R^n that satisfies the general Ito SDE : d\\\\vec X=\\\\vec a(t,\\\\vec X)\\\\,dt+\\\\vec b(t,\\\\vec X)\\\\,dW, where drift \\\\vec a and volatility \\\\vec b are sufficiently smooth functions of their arguments.

The above describes only one time step. Repeat this time step (t_m-t_0)/h times in order to integrate the SDE from time t=t_0 to t=t_m. The scheme integrates Stratonovich SDEs to O(h) provided one sets S_k=0 throughout (instead of choosing \\\\pm 1). Higher order Runge-Kutta schemes Higher-order schemes also exist, but become increasingly complex. R√∂√üler developed many schemes for Ito SDEs, whereas Komori developed schemes for Stratonovich SDEs. Rackauckas extended these schemes to allow for adaptive-time stepping via Rejection Sampling with Memory (RSwM), resulting in orders of magnitude efficiency increases in practical biological models, along with coefficient optimization for improved stability.

Sister Prejean's book was earlier adapted as a film which Robbins directed; it starred Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon. It was also adapted as an opera, first produced in 2000. Rather than producing the play professionally for commercial performances, in 2004 Robbins offered the play to schools and colleges throughout the United States, particularly Catholic Jesuit schools. The project, titled \\"The Dead Man Walking School Theatre Project\\", is managed by the \\"Ministry Against the Death Penalty,\\" where Sister Prejean now bases her advocacy work against the death penalty. The University of Scranton was one of the original Jesuit universities to perform the play in their 2004-2005 season.  History of the play  Sister Helen Prejean, who had become an internationally known human rights activist as a result of her book, Dead Man Walking, first conceived the idea of a stage version of her work in 1998. She had read a New Yorker magazine article that said Arthur Miller's play, Death of a Salesman, had been performed a million times, and was performed every day somewhere in the world. Sister Helen realized that if Dead Man Walking could be adapted as a play, its influence would be expanded. Sister Helen had previously worked with Tim Robbins on the film version of her book. She invited him to write a stage adaptation of her book, and he accepted. Robbins and Prejean decided that, rather than take the play to Broadway, he would \\"use the play as a tool to create deeper reflections on the death penalty in our nation's high schools and colleges.\\" The performance requirements are that any school mounting a production must also involve at least two academic departments to offer courses pertaining to the death penalty. According to the Catholic Mobilizing Network and the play's website: > Since the launch of the project in the fall of 2003, more than 250 high > schools and colleges across the country have produced the play, conducted > academic courses on the death penalty, and brought the issue to life on > their campuses through art, music, and public education and action events.  Participating schools  More than 250 educational institutions ‚Äî high schools, colleges, and universities ‚Äî have produced the play in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and also in Canada, England, and Africa. The play was performed by the King's College Theatre Department under the direction of M. Sheileen Godwin in February 2008, as part of Tim Robbins experiment. The show's cast was made up mainly of students and faculty members, as well as members of the community. Sister Helen Prejean came to King's College just days before the show opened and spoke with the entire campus community about her experiences. She also addressed the actors who were performing in the play and attended a dress rehearsal.

The series was a production of Warner Bros. Television  Casting  The casting was Deedee Bradley, Megan Branman, Reyna Karp and Susan Vash. The primary focus was the baby who would play as \\"Otis Cox\\". Scenes with 'Otis' made it challenging for the rest of the cast as opposed to doing them with an older child, teenager or adult. And filming in a scene, many factors occur such as adapting to any possible noises and crying and having added responsibility. Keeping the baby occupied whilst doing the scene to prevent any outbursts is also a primary concern which can be very challenging. Nicole Richie was a guest star.  Filming  Main scenes are primarily the open-space apartment of Jimmy and Beth Cox's kitchen, dining and living area and the sound room inside the radio station of where Jimmy and Carl host their radio show, Khor. Usually after each show, the ending scene will be in Jimmy and Beth's bedroom while they lay in bed and speak to each other about the day. Other scenes also include restaurants, Pamela's bedroom, Otis' bedroom, a rooftop of a building, a school administration office, a school performance art stage and a live music stage within the radio station building which are all featured in Denver, Colorado, but filmed in Los Angeles, California, USA.  Opening theme  The opening theme is \\"Rock Me Baby\\" by Matter which is an up-beat rock song. The closing theme is the instrumental version used for the closing theme. Samples of the instrumental song is used to open and close from adverts.  Broadcast  In the USA the pilot episode of Rock Me Baby debuted on the UPN network on Monday September 15, 2003. The second episode 'Coupling' aired on September 23, 2003 and the following episodes followed exactly one week later. The last episode for the first series was 'Singing for your Supper' which aired on May 25, 2004. After the first season, UPN decided to cancel production of Rock Me Baby.

The school was originally one of two high schools in Union City, along with Union Hill High School, that served the city's students. With the merger of both schools into the new Union City High School in 2008 and the opening of that school's new campus in 2009, both of the former high schools were converted to serve sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. The former Emerson High School is now Emerson Middle School. History Emerson High School was originally the sole high school to serve the municipality of West Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1925, West Hoboken merged with its neighbor to the north, Union Hill, New Jersey, which had been served by Union Hill High School, to form the city of Union City, New Jersey.Snyder, John P. The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968. Bureau of Geology and Topography. Trenton, New Jersey. 1969. p. 148. Accessed June 18, 2013. As the city was now served by two high schools, students who lived north of the Route 495 overpass (which previously divided the two towns) would attend Union Hill, while those who lived south of it would attend Emerson, though that boundary was shifted in later years to keep the school enrollments roughly equal.Hu, Winnie (November 22, 2007). \\"After 88 Years of Rivalry, the Last as Us and Them\\".

It will have a football field and bleachers built on the roof so that players will no longer have to share the facilities at Jos√© Mart√≠ Middle School.\\" By 2007, both Union Hill and Emerson, which are separated by one mile, had close to 1,500 students and offered the same schedule, courses and after-school sports, and their test scores and student demographics were comparable. Unlike Emerson, Union Hill did not have an R.O.T.C. program, though Union Hill had a stronger arts program than Emerson, and both schools had different career education programs that allowed students to pursue interests like child care, hospitality and fashion (the city was once known for its embroidery factories). Superintendent of Schools Stanley M. Sanger stated in 2007 that he received 25 to 40 requests a year from students who want to switch to the rival high school due to a particular academic interest or a family connection. Most such requests were granted. The school was the 288th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 316 schools statewide, in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2008 cover story on the state's Top Public High Schools. The school was ranked 265th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state.\\"Top New Jersey High Schools 2008: By Rank\\", New Jersey Monthly, September 2008, posted August 7, 2008.

Through the 2007‚Äì08 school year, Emerson High School was one of two high schools to serve Union City, along with Union Hill High School. The last graduating class for both schools was in June 2008. The student bodies of both schools were to merge into the new Union City High School, which is housed in a building on the site of the former Roosevelt Stadium. The switch was originally planned for September 2008, but the school was not completed by then, and pending the completion, Union Hill and Emerson became known as the north and south campuses of Union City High School, respectively. The new school opened September 3, 2009, with Emerson and Union Hill High Schools converting into middle schools.

Turkey game During Union Hill and Emerson's time as Union City's two high schools, the Union Hill Hillers and the Emerson Bulldogs were rivals in athletics. In competing for the Hudson County Interscholastic Football Championship, Union Hill beat Emerson five consecutive years from 1923 to 1927. During the November 1927 game, Union Hill beat their rivals 19 to 0 in front of a crowd of 12,000 people.\\"UNION HILL CAPTURES HUDSON COUNTY TITLE; Vanquishes Emerson High School Eleven, 19 to 0, Before a Crowd of 12,000.\\" The New York Times. November 27, 1927. For 88 consecutive years, the most notable aspect of their rivalry on the field was the annual Turkey Game, held on Thanksgiving, a tradition that began in 1919, when the high schools served the neighboring towns of West Hoboken in the south and Union Hill in the north, a rivalry described as \\"simmering hatred\\" that gave the schools' principals cause to fear that the first game might turn lead to violence. That game ended in a tie of 0-0. When the towns of Union Hill and West Hoboken merged in 1925 to form the city of Union City, the Turkey Game remained, despite the fact that schools in the same district usually do not often compete directly against each other. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Turkey Game attracted as many as 15,000 fans. A wooden chariot would be pulled around the field at halftime, carrying the football king and queen from the defending school, who were booed and pelted with paper when they got to the opposing side of Roosevelt Stadium. This part of the tradition fell into disuse by the early 1970s. The Alumni Trophy, which was awarded to the victor of the annual Turkey Game, now sits in Union City High School. On the lower right of the trophy is the inscription:End of an Era 1919 - 2007 40-40-9. Stanley M. Sanger, who graduated from Emerson in 1969, and who never set foot in Union Hill until he became a teacher, characterized the Union Hill-Emerson rivalry by saying, \\"It‚Äôs our Mason-Dixon line. You knew Union Hill was north and Emerson was south, and you respected the boundary. It was the natural state of things.\\" An old traditional greeting before the game was \\"Are we having hot turkey or cold turkey?\\", as the loser was said to eat \\"cold turkey\\", figuratively speaking. Over the decades, coaches were known to zealously guard their game plans and players, who were alert for spies, were often excused from their classes to practice in secret locations. When sharing Roosevelt Stadium for practice, they would use opposite ends of the 50 yard line. While the athletic coaches were not permitted to recruit players from the rival school, students were known to often recruit players from the elementary and middle schools to attend their high schools. A 50 lbs. brass trophy whose base is engraved with scores from every game, was passed back and forth between the two schools, and the winning school was rewarded with a half-day of school on the Monday after the game. According to David Wilcomes, a former football player and later football coach and the last principal of Union Hill High School, the Turkey Game developed a nearly religious significance as a Thanksgiving ritual for Union City citizens,\\"The Last Turkey Game\\". The New York Times. November 24, 2007 and a loss for one's favored team would cast a pall upon the day's subsequent holiday festivities, commenting, \\"If you don‚Äôt win, it's a long Thanksgiving dinner.\\" Wilcomes, whose father also played for Union Hill, stated that he stopped answering his home phone following losing games due to the constant reviewing and second-guessing of his strategies by various relatives. By 2007, the Union City district spent $130,000 annually on football. Neither school was a regional powerhouse. Statistically, both endured cycles of consecutive wins and losses, and were roughly even in statistics, with Emerson having won 40 games, Union Hill, 39, and 9 ties. Union Hill won the 2006 game, while Emerson won the seven games prior. The Turkey Game tradition ended with its final game on November 22, 2007, prior to the two schools' merger into Union City High School, which is now housed on the site of the former Roosevelt Stadium, and features an athletic field on its roof. (During the year between the end of the Turkey Game and the September 2009 opening of Union City High School, the two schools shared the facilities at Jos√© Mart√≠ Middle School.) The district spent $2,000 on newspaper ads to invite alumni from around the state to the game, and to an alumni breakfast that preceded it. The district installed additional bleachers to accommodate an expected turnout of more than 4,000. It sold commemorative tickets featuring photos of the 1919 Union Hill and Emerson teams, and a game program whose proceeds went the new school's scholarship fund. During the final game, both principals sat together at halftime to present a united front, and the players on both teams were required to wear T-shirts bearing the new school's name under their shoulder pads. The final Turkey game was attended by 6,000 spectators, including Senator Robert MenendezFahim, Kareen (November 24, 2007). \\"High Schools‚Äô Football Rivalry Is Now History\\". The New York Times.

The end of the Turkey Game came amid waning Thanksgiving football traditions in communities across the United States, as earlier football seasons and competing holiday demands on players and their families made them less relevant. Post-holiday state championships have also overtaken such traditions in importance, as coaches grew reluctant to risk injury to players headed for the championships.

Biography Leech was born in Dublin the son of Anne Louisa n√©e Garbois (1847‚Äì1921) and Professor Henry Brougham Leech LLD (1843‚Äì1921). He went to school at St Columba's College, Dublin in Rathfarnham, later studying at the Metropolitan School. He later transferred to the Royal Hibernian Academy and studied under Walter Osborne. In 1903, Leech left Dublin for Paris, where he would fall in love with the French landscape. After he returned to Dublin from Brittany in 1906 he was soon embraced into the artistic circle of George Russell (A.E.), Constance Gore-Booth and her husband Casimir Dunin Markievicz. He exhibited nearly seventy paintings with them in a group exhibition at the Leinster Lecture Hall in August 1907. In December 1909 Leech exhibited with Jack Yeats, Albert Power, Eva Hamilton, William Orpen, Lily Williams, A.E., Constance Gore-Booth and Dermod O‚ÄôBrien in the first Aonach art exhibition, organised by Sinn F√©in as part of the Irish Festival at the Rotunda. On his return to France he met and in 1912 married Saurin Elizabeth n√©e Smith (1879‚Äìc1951), a young painter of a similar style. They separated after just two years of marriage. Leech would travel throughout Europe and eventually settled in England in 1919, with frequent visits to the South of France, to Marseilles, Grasse and Cagnes-sur-Mer. In about 1919 William was commissioned by a London solicitor Percy Dumville Botterell CBE (1880‚Äì1950) to paint a portrait of his wife May n√©e Pearson (1881‚Äì1965). Percy had served as a commercial attach√© to the Hague in the later years of the war and May had organised a relief center for released prisoners of war; one of these was William's brother, Lt-Col Cecil John Farran Leech (1882‚Äì1952) who made the introduction. William also painted in 1920 ‚ÄúPortrait of Suzanne Botterell‚Äù, Percy and May's daughter. William and May maintained a friendship and, after the deaths of Saurin Elizabeth and Percy, they married in 1953. In the last years of their lives they lived in Candy Cottage, West Clandon, Surrey. Art Work Leech was well known for his illustrations of Concarneau harbour. The works of Leech feature coastal and harbour scenes, landscapes, interiors, still life and portraits. *Leech at Irish Art Notes :1.Daughter of Katherine Howard Lane and Francis Stribling Smith, born Jan 1879 in St Louis, Missouri, USA.

As Gisela Richter puts it, the forms of these vases find their \\"happiest expression\\" in the 5th and 6th centuries BC, yet it has been possible to date vases thanks to the variation in a form‚Äôs shape over time, a fact particularly useful when dating unpainted or plain black-gloss ware. The task of naming Greek vase shapes is by no means a straightforward one (by convention the term \\"vase\\" has a very broad meaning in the field, covering anything that is a vessel of some sort). The endeavour by archaeologists to match vase forms with those names that have come down to us from Greek literature began with Panofka‚Äôs 1829 book Recherches sur les veritables noms des vases grecs, whose confident assertion that he had rediscovered the ancient nomenclature was quickly disputed by Gerhard and Letronne. A few surviving vases were labelled with their names in antiquity; these included a hydria depicted on the Fran√ßois Vase and a kylix that declares, ‚ÄúI am the decorated kylix of lovely Phito‚Äù (BM, B450). Vases in use are sometimes depicted in paintings on vases, which can help scholars interpret written descriptions. Much of our written information about Greek pots comes from such late writers as Athenaios and Pollux and other lexicographers who described vases unknown to them, and their accounts are often contradictory or confused. With those caveats, the names of Greek vases are fairly well settled, even if such names are a matter of convention rather than historical fact. The following vases are mostly Attic, from the 5th and 6th centuries, and follow the Beazley naming convention. Many shapes derive from metal vessels, especially in silver, which survive in far smaller numbers. Some pottery vases were probably intended as cheaper substitutes for these, either for use or to be placed as grave goods. Some terms, especially among the types of kylix or drinking cup, combine a shape and a type or location of decoration, as in the band cup, eye cup and others. Some terms are defined by function as much as shape, such as the aryballos, which later potters turned into all sorts of fancy novelty shapes. Overview Greek pottery may be divided in four broad categories, given here with common types:Woodford, 12-14; \\"Shapes\\" (see menu at left), Beazley Archive, Oxford * storage and transport vessels, including the amphora, pithos, pelike, hydria, stamnos, pyxis, * mixing vessels, mainly for symposia or male drinking parties, including the krater, and dinos, and kyathos ladles, * jugs and cups, several types of kylix also just called cups, kantharos, phiale, skyphos, rhyton, mastos, and jug-types oinochoe and loutrophoros, * vases for oils, perfumes and cosmetics, including the large lekythos, and the small aryballos, alabastron, and askos. In addition various standard types might be used as external grave-markers (in extra large versions, sometimes in stone), funerary urns containing ashes, or as grave goods. Several types of vase, especially the taller ones, could be made in \\"plastic\\" forms (also called \\"figure vases\\" or \\"relief vases\\") where the body was shaped sculpturally (somewhat in the manner of the modern Toby jug), typically to form a human head.

His writing most typically concerns the outdoors sports of fishing in general and fly fishing in particular, as well as upland bird hunting and mountaineering, often with an intellectual and philosophical bent, and an eye towards the various cultures and traditions surrounding different forms of fishing around the world. In addition to his outdoors writings, Gaines covered the \\"Golden Age\\" of professional bodybuilding and is the author of Pumping Iron, considered the definitive journalistic work in that field, and credited in large part for bringing greater public awareness to what was formerly a little-known subculture, as well as helping to launch the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Gaines also narrated and contributed to the documentary film of the same name. Gaines is active in the conservation movement and in particular the stewardship of the North American Atlantic Salmon fisheries. He has served on the board of directors of the Atlantic Salmon Federation. Early life Gaines was born in Jacksonville, Florida on January 6, 1942, the son of Margaret (n√©e Shook) and Charles Latham Gaines. At the age of ten, he and his family moved to Birmingham, Alabama. As a teenager, Gaines took up bodybuilding. He briefly attended Washington and Lee University but left school to travel around the country. He later received his BA from Birmingham- Southern College and his MFA in writing from the University of Iowa. In 1970, he moved to New Hampshire, where he taught creative writing at New England College. Writing career In 1972, Gaines published his first novel, Stay Hungry. This work of fiction focused on the subculture of bodybuilding during the early 1970s, and revolved around the lives of three characters in Birmingham, Alabama: Craig Blake, a young heir from a family of Southern gentry; Mary Tate Farnsworth, a young woman of working-class background; and Joe Santo, a bodybuilder, athlete and Renaissance man figure of French Canadian and Menominee Indian ancestry. As well as exploring the culture of bodybuilding in great detail, the novel also dealt with themes of class difference, spirituality and self-identity. In 1976, Stay Hungry was made into a motion picture starring Jeff Bridges, Sally Field and Arnold Schwarzenegger (the latter in one of his earliest roles.) In 1974 Gaines created Pumping Iron: The Art and Sport of Bodybuilding, a photo-essay with photographs by George Butler which focused in even further detail on the professional bodybuilding scene during the 1970s. It featured such bodybuilding greats as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu, Serge Nubret, Ken Waller, Mike Katz and Ed Corney, and provided a factual and philosophical exposition of the sport of bodybuilding. It is considered to be a seminal work in that field, and still enjoys significant popularity. Pumping Iron was adapted by Butler into a documentary film of the same name in 1977, this time focusing on the 1975 Mr. Olympia bodybuilding contest and the rivalry between Schwarzenegger and up- and-comer Lou Ferrigno, though also including all of the bodybuilders from the original book. The film enjoyed great success, bringing both Ferrigno and Schwarzenegger into the spotlight and increasing their public profiles tremendously. It also helped to further popularize bodybuilding as a sport and bring it into the mainstream. Gaines continued writing on the topic of bodybuilding, publishing an exercise manual, Staying Hard: The Only Exercise Book You Will Ever Need in 1980 and writing a biography of Charles Atlas in 1982. In 1995 he wrote the autobiographical novel A Family Place, which documented the building of a family cabin in Nova Scotia with the help of his wife and children. In 2001 he published The Next Valley Over: An Angler's Progress, a creative nonfiction work which detailed his fly fishing experiences all over the world. He also co-authored Leaper: The Wonderful World of Atlantic Salmon Fishing with Monte Burke. Invention of paintball In 1980, Charles Gaines and his friend Hayes Noel, a stock trader from New York City, had an argument about whether the talent for survival was an ingrained instinct adaptable to any environment (Noel), or a pattern of learned behavior specific to a particular environment (Gaines). Noel held that his ability to survive and thrive in the Wall Street jungle was transferable to a true jungle, the woods, or anywhere else. Gaines, a life-long outdoorsman, argued that while he could not compete with Noel in the city, he would be more than his match in the woods. Gaines lived at the time on a farm in New Hampshire where he raised sheep. Shortly after the argument with Noel, a friend sent him a catalogue of products for stockmen. In it was a CO2-powered pistol, made by a company called Nel-Spot, which shot a single oil-based dye pellet and was used for marking bred-ewes, and by foresters to mark trees. Seeing a way to finally test their argument, Noel and Gaines ordered two of the pistols and some pellets and hunted each other in the woods on Gaines‚Äôs farm. Doing so proved to be so exhilarating that they decided to invite ten other men to play a game they devised off the trial run, which they named ‚ÄúThe Survival Game‚Äù. The object of the game was for a player to collect each of four different-colored flags located at widely separated ‚Äúflag stations‚Äù inside a large tract of woods, and to be the first player to emerge from the woods with all four flags without being marked by another player‚Äôs paint pellet. Gaines enlisted his friend Bob Gurnsey, a New Hampshire ski-shop owner, to help him and Noel organize the game, and in October of 1981 the three men, along with nine other friends, played the first paintball game ever played in Henniker, NH. Among the players in that game were three writers for national magazines. All of them wrote articles about the game, and Gaines was deluged with letters from people all over the country who wanted to play the Survival Game. To meet that demand, Gaines, Noel and Gurnsey formed a company called The National Survival Game, which standardized rules for both individual and team versions of the game, and was the first company to sell paintball equipment.

In 1971, Guerra brought Manuel Herr√°n into the small business to help in the daily operations. Armando Guerra, Sr. died in 1979 and Manuel Herr√°n took over the retail grocery company. Herr√°n led the successful expansion of the chain by bringing in several of his brothers and other relatives into the business. By compensating store managers based primarily on the profitability of the store and by allowing key managers to invest in the business, Herr√°n was able to attract and retain motivated partners. Armando Guerra, Sr.'s son, Armando Guerra, Jr. became President of Sedano's Pharmacy. The chain has grown to include 35 supermarkets in Miami-Dade, Broward, Orange and Osceola counties in Florida.

Born in Philadelphia, Sklaroff attended Friends' Central School before earning her BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). While at RISD, Sklaroff won the Providence Art Award and was selected for the European Honors Program, where she studied under Friedrich St.Florian. Sklaroff later received her MFA from the Parsons School of Design in New York City where she studied under Faith Ringgold and Glenn Goldberg. While a student at Parsons, Sklaroff received a grant from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the World Views program, which provided her an artist's studio on the 91st floor of Tower 1 of the World Trade Center. Early Work Sklaroff's early works were primarily representational views of cityscapes and landscapes with a focus on the relationship between negative space, complementary colors, and the contrast between light and dark. Her work from the World Trade Center, in the winter of 1999, used the vertical format of the windows to frame her views of the city. More recent works, while still exploring these themes, have included greater detail and more prominently feature scenes including figures and rooftops. A 2009 New York exhibition of Sklaroff's work was reviewed in the Winter 2010 edition of American Arts Quarterly, which stated, \\"What gives her work its unique interest and power is her clever sense of color contrasts, along with reflections of light, depictions of shadows and smoky atmospheres.\\"American Arts Quarterly, review of Sonya Sklaroff, accessed on December 22, 2013 This publication also noted, \\"Although she also paints country landscapes and interiors, she is best known for her images of New York City.\\" Her cityscapes are particularly noted for her inclusion of New York City's water towers, which display an almost anthropomorphic character.

History  wada for Ghiyath al-Din, Sultan of Malwa, at Mandu The sultanate of Malwa was founded by Dilawar Khan Ghuri, the governor of Malwa for the Delhi Sultanate, who asserted his independence in 1392, but did not actually assume the ensigns of royalty till 1401. Initially Dhar was the capital of the new kingdom, but soon it was shifted to Mandu, which was renamed Shadiabad (the city of joy). After his death, he was succeeded by his son Alp Khan, who assumed the title of Hoshang Shah. The Ghurid dynasty, founded by Dilawar Khan Ghuri, was replaced by Mahmud Shah I, who proclaimed himself king on 16 May 1436. The Khalji dynasty, founded by him, ruled over Malwa till 1531. Mahmud Khalji I was succeeded by his eldest son Ghiyas-ud-Din. The last days of Ghiyas-ud-Din were embittered by a struggle for throne between his two sons, with Nasir-ud-Din emerging victorious over Ala-ud-Din and ascending the throne on 22 October 1500, The last ruler Mahmud Shah II surrendered to Bahadur Shah, the sultan of Gujarat after the fort of Mandu fell to Bahadur on 25 May 1531.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp.173-86 During 1531 ‚Äì 1537 the kingdom was under the control of Bahadur Shah, though the Mughal padshah (emperor) Humayun captured it for a short period during 1535-36. In 1537, Qadir Shah, an ex-officer of the previous Khalji dynasty rulers, regained control over a part of the erstwhile kingdom. But in 1542, Sher Shah Suri conquered the kingdom, defeating him and appointed Shuja'at Khan as the governor. His son, Baz Bahadur, declared himself independent in 1555. In 1561, Akbar the Great's Mughal army, led by Adham Khan and Pir Muhammad Khan, attacked Malwa and defeated Baz Bahadur in the battle of Sarangpur on 29 March 1561, culminating in the Mughal conquest of Malwa. Akbar soon recalled Adham Khan and made over command to Pir Muhammad. Pir Muhammad attacked Khandesh and proceeded up to Burhanpur, but he was defeated by a coalition of three powers: Miran Mubarak Shah II of Khandesh, Tufal Khan of Berar Sultanate and Baz Bahadur. Pir Muhammad died while retreating. The confederate army pursued the Mughals and drove them out of Malwa. Baz Bahadur regained his kingdom for a short period. In 1562, Akbar sent another army, led by Abdullah Khan, an Uzbeg, which finally defeated Baz Bahadur. He fled to Chittor.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007) The Mughul Empire, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , pp.112-3 It became the Malwa Subah (top- level province) of the Mughal empire, with seat at Ujjain and Abdullah Khan became its first governor. Art and architecture An illustration from the manuscript of the Nimat Nama completed during the reign of Nasir-ud-Din Shah Malwa painting Many remarkable illustrated manuscripts were prepared during the period of the sultanate. An illustrated manuscript of Kalpa Sutra (1439) (presently in the National Museum, Delhi) was prepared in Mandu during the reign of Mahmud Shah IKhare, M.D. (ed.) (1981). Malwa through the Ages, Bhopal: the Directorate of Archaeology & Museums, Government of M.P., pp.193-5 But the most interesting is a manuscript of the Nimat Nama, a treatise on the art of cooking, which bears many portraits of Ghiyas-ud-Din Shah but the colophon bears the name of Nasir-ud-Din Shah. The other notable illustrated manuscripts of this period are of the Miftah-ul-Fuzala, a dictionary of rare words, the Bustan (1502) painted by Haji Mahmud and the Aja'ib-us-San'ati (1508). Another manuscript of the Anwar-i-Suhaili (now in the National Museum, Delhi) probably also belong to this period.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007). The Mughul Empire, Mumbai:Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, ,pp.804-5 Malwa architecture Rani Rupmati Pavilion in Mandu, the capital of the Malwa Sultanate The monuments built during the sultanate period are almost concentrated in Mandu city. The early monuments were assembled out of the materials of earlier Hindu temples, according to the Islamic plan and convention. But nothing seems to have been done to conceal or alter their essential Hindu appearance. The significant among them are the Kamal Maula Masjid (c.1400), the Lal Masjid (1405), Dilawar Khan's Masjid (c.1405) and the Masjid of Malik Mughis (1452) in Mandu.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai:Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp.702-9 the Jahaz Mahal Hoshang Shah laid the foundation of the Mandu fort on the ruins of the original fortification. With him began the second and the classical phase of Malwa architecture. Some of the ten gateways on the 25 miles long wall of the fortress of Mandu were built by the Malwa sultans, the earliest one being the Delhi Darwaza (northern gateway). Within the walls of the fortress, presently only forty structures survive in different stages of preservation. The largest and most impressive of them is Jami Masjid, which according to an inscription was begun by Hoshang Shah and completed by Mahmud Shah I in 1454. The remarkable Durbar hall, known as the Hindola Mahal is also attributed to Hoshang Shah. Opposite to Jami Masjid, the large structural complex known as the Ashrafi Mahal comprises a group of buildings successively built in course of a rather long period. Its original nucleus seems to be a madrasa building erected as an adjunct to the Jami Masjid, probably during the reign of Hoshang Shah. According to Firishta, the tomb of Hoshang Shah was built by Mahmud Shah I. The later mausoleums, such as the tomb of Darya Khan, the Dai ka Mahal and the Chhappan Mahal were built on the same design. A long structural complex situated between two lakes has a curious name, the Jahaz Mahal (ship-palace). Though the date of this monument is not definitely known, its general style is in accord with the character of Ghiyas-ud-Din Khalji. A lonely building on the slope of a hill by the side of Riwa Kund is known by the local people as Baz Bahadur's palace. According to an inscription this monument was actually built by Nasir-ud-Din Shah. The Rani Rupmati Pavilion stands on the southern edge of the plateau and as its situation and form indicate, was, in all probability, designed for military purposes.

He studied law in Savannah, Georgia, and gained admission to the state bar and became a practicing attorney. In 1790, he also served as a first lieutenant in the Georgia Militia. Political office Elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1796, Jones was reelected to that body in 1798, but subsequently resigned. While seeking re-election to the Georgia House of Representatives, Jones simultaneously ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. In the election of 1798, Georgia used a statewide at-large method for electing two members to serve in the 6th Congress of the United States. Jones received 4,264 votes (37.3%), ahead of second place finisher Benjamin Taliaferro who received 3,823 votes (33.4%). Both Jones and Taliaferro ran as candidates on the Federalist Party ticket. The incumbent, Abraham Baldwin, running as a Democratic-Republican, came in a distant third with 3,135 votes (27.4%) Jones resigned from the Georgia General Assembly and took his seat in congress, instead. In 1798, Jones also served on the state constitutional convention. Death and legacy Jones died while still serving in that position in 1801 and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.. Jones County, Georgia, was named in his honor.

It is induced by a shear stress in the material. Shear strain is distinguished from volumetric strain. The change in a material's volume in response to stress and change of angle is called has angle of shear Overview Often, the verb shearing refers more specifically to a mechanical process that causes a plastic shear strain in a material, rather than causing a merely elastic one. A plastic shear strain is a continuous (non-fracturing) deformation that is irreversible, such that the material does not recover its original shape. It occurs when the material is yielding. The process of shearing a material may induce a volumetric strain along with the shear strain. In soil mechanics, the volumetric strain associated with shearing is known as Reynolds' dilation if it increases the volume, or compaction if it decreases the volume. The shear center (also known as the elastic axis or torsional axis) is an imaginary point on a section, where a shear force can be applied without inducing any torsion. In general, the shear center is not the centroid. For cross-sectional areas having one axis of symmetry, the shear center is located on the axis of symmetry. For those having two axes of symmetry, the shear center lies on the centroid of the cross-section. In some materials such as metals, plastics, or granular materials like sand or soils, the shearing motion rapidly localizes into a narrow band, known as a shear band. In that case, all the sliding occurs within the band while the blocks of material on either side of the band simply slide past one another without internal deformation. A special case of shear localization occurs in brittle materials when they fracture along a narrow band. Then, all subsequent shearing occurs within the fracture. Plate tectonics, where the plates of the Earth's crust slide along fracture zones, is an example of this. Shearing in soil mechanics is measured with a triaxial shear test or a direct shear test.

It placed the burden of upkeep of the highways on individual parishes. Clauses The Act enacted that each year, in the Easter week, every parish was to elect \\"two honest persons\\" of the parish to serve as the Surveyor of Highways, who would be responsible for the upkeep of those highways within the parish boundaries which ran to market towns. The Surveyors would announce, on the first Sunday after Easter, four days before 24 JuneThe feast-day of the nativity of John the Baptist on which the maintenance work was to be carried out, and for these four days the whole parish was to work on the highways.

Childhood and education Hutchinson was born in Glasgow. His father, Harry Hutchinson, a Scottish printer whose own father had left Dublin to find work in Scotland, was Sinn F√©in treasurer in Glasgow and was interned in Frongoch in 1919‚Äì21. His mother, Cathleen Sara, was born in Cowcaddens, Glasgow, of emigrant parents from Donegal. She was a friend of Constance Markievicz. In response to a letter from Cathleen, √âamon de Valera found work in Dublin for Harry as a clerk in the Labour Exchange, and later he held a post in Stationery Office. Pearse was five years old when the family moved to Dublin, and was the last to be enrolled in St. Enda's School before it closed. He then went to school at the Christian Brothers, Synge Street where he learnt Irish and Latin. One of his close friends there was the poet and literary critic John Jordan. In 1948 he attended University College Dublin where he spent a year and a half, learning Spanish and Italian. Travels overseas Having published some poems in The Bell in 1945, his poetic development was greatly influenced by a 1950 holiday in Spain and Portugal. A short stop en route at Vigo brought him into contact for the first time with the culture of Galicia. Later, in Andalusia, he was entranced by the landscape and by the works of the Spanish poets Lorca, Prados and Cernuda: \\"That early September of 1950,\\" he would later write, \\"the light walked for me as it never had before, and I walked through the light I'd always longed for\\".Pearse Hutchinson, Introduction, Done into English, 2003 In 1951 he left Ireland again, determined to go and live in Spain. Unable to get work in Madrid, as he had hoped, he travelled instead to Geneva, where he got a job as a translator with the International Labour Office, which brought him into contact with Catalan exiles, speaking a language then largely suppressed in Spain. An invitation by a Dutch friend led to a visit to the Netherlands, in preparation for which he taught himself Dutch. He returned to Ireland in 1953, and he became interested in the Irish language poetry of writers such as Piaras Feirit√©ar and Aonghus Fionn √ì D√°laigh, and published a number of poems in Irish in the magazine Comhar in 1954. The same year he travelled again to Spain, this time to Barcelona, where he learnt the Catalan and Galician languages, and got to know Catalan poets such as Salvador Espriu and Carles Riba. With the British poet P. J. Kavanagh, he organised a reading of Catalan poetry in the British Institute. He went home to Ireland in 1957 but returned to Barcelona in 1961, and continued to support Catalan poets. An invitation by the publisher Joan Gili to translate some poems by Josep Carner led to the publication of his first book, a collection of thirty of Carner's poems in Catalan and English, in 1962. A project to publish Hutchinson's translation of Espriu's La Pell de brau (The Bull-skin), fell through some years later. Some of the poems from this project are included in the collection Done into English. Return to Ireland In 1963, his first collection of original poems in English, Tongue Without Hands (the title a quotation from the Spanish epic El Cid), was published by Dolmen Press in Ireland. In 1967, having spent nearly ten years altogether in Spain, Hutchinson returned to Ireland, making a living as a poet and journalist writing in both Irish and English. In 1968, a collection of poems in Irish, Faoistin Bhacach (A Lame Confession), was published. Expansions, a collection in English, followed in 1969. Friend Songs (1970) was a new collection of translations, this time of medieval poems originally written in Galaicoportuguese. In 1972 Watching the Morning Grow, a new collection of original poems in English, came out, followed in 1975 by another, The Frost Is All Over. In October 1971, Hutchinson took up the Gregory Fellowship in Poetry at the University of Leeds, on the recommendation of Professor A. Norman Jeffares. There was some controversy around the appointment following accusations, later retracted, that Jeffares had been guilty of bias in the selection because of their joint Irish heritage. Hutchinson held tenure at the University for three years, and during that time contributed to the University's influential poetry magazine Poetry & Audience; one edition of the magazine, devoted entirely to his poetry, was published as a limited edition.'Leeds Poetry 1950‚Äì1980: Pearse Hutchinson', Leeds University Special Collections From 1977 to 1978 he compiled and presented Or√≥ Domhnaigh, a weekly radio programme of Irish poetry, music and folklore for Ireland's national network, RT√â. He also contributed a weekly column on the Irish language to the station's magazine RT√â Guide for over ten years. 1981 saw the publication of another translated collection: this time a collaboration with Melita Cataldi, of Old Irish lyrics into Italian. Another collection in English, Climbing the Light (1985), which also included translations from Irish, Italian and Galician, was followed in 1989 by his last Irish collection, Le Cead na Gr√©ine (By Leave of the Sun). The Soul that Kissed the Body (1990) was a selection of his Irish poems translated into English. His most recent English collection was Barnsley Main Seam (1995); the long title poem celebrates the splendours of York Minster, and is a homage to the manual workers of the world. His Collected Poems were published in 2002 to mark his 75th birthday. This was followed in 2003 by Done into English, a selection of many of the translated works he produced over the years; it contains translations of more than sixty poets from over a dozen languages or dialects, including Catalan, Italian, Dutch, Milanese and Irish. 'Every poem in this book has been translated because I liked it', he explained. A co- editor and founder of the literary journal Cyphers, he received the Butler Award for Irish writing in 1969. He is a member of Aosd√°na, the state- supported association of artists, from which he received a cnuas (stipend) to allow him to go on writing. He has described this as \\"a miracle and a godsend\\": \\"I was fifty-four when I was invited to become a member and frankly I was at the end of my tether. I might have carried on, but I would have been in the gutter because I would have been evicted or I would have gone mad or killed myself or both.\\"John Boland, \\"A great man in a low time\\", Irish Times, 29 March 1997 A two-day symposium of events was held at Trinity College Dublin, to celebrate his 80th birthday in 2007, with readings from his works by writers including Macdara Woods, Eil√©an N√≠ Chuillean√°in, Paul Durcan and Sujata Bhatt.Deirdre Falvey, 'The ghosts of ministers past', The Irish Times, 8 December 2007. In his most recent collection, At Least for a While (2008), which was shortlisted for the Poetry Now Award, he comments on the replacement of the traditional symbolism of Ireland with the Celtic Tiger: \\"Music and a small plant/ we had for emblems once./ Better, surely,/ than lion or eagle./ Now our proudest boast/ is a dangerous beast of prey.\\"Pearse Hutchinson, 'Shamrock and Harp', At Least for a While (Gallery Press, 2008).

'When he writes of privilege and opportunism Hutchinson leaves no aftertaste of self-righteousness'.Michael Kenneally, Poetry in Contemporary Irish Literature, (Rowman & Littlefield, 1995) page 11. The Irish Times has described him as 'one of Ireland's most inventive, instructive, and perennially newsworthy poets. ... His poems are often short, they can appear delicate on the page, and they sometimes seem to record glimpses or passing glances, but they always embody and, at their best, articulate Hutchinson's desire for what he once called \\"true gentleness\\".'Philip Coleman, 'Soaring towards serenity', The Irish Times, 9 August 2008.

It is a survival story like most of his other books, but also involves the science fiction genre. Plot The story begins with Mark Harrison, a 13-year-old survival enthusiast, hiking through the mountainous Magruder Missile Range. All of a sudden, he gets bitten by a snake and falls into a blue light. He wakes up in a strange world that he believes is an alien world with many similarities to Earth. He uses his survival skills to live off the land and while exploring the forest, he discovers a camp made up of short, human-like creatures with webbed feet and dark, olive-colored skin. Soon he finds them too warlike to bear interacting with. He also hears a creature called the howling thing. A tribe which Mark refers to as the Arrow People allow him to live with them. He meets a girl named Leeta, whom he befriends. Soon after, he is enslaved by the Tsook, a metal-weapon wielding race of hominids. Over the next three months, he learns their language and develops feelings for Megan, the chief's daughter. Mark attempts to flee the village, but as he is trying to escape, he learns of an imminent invasion of the village. Mark returns to warn the tribe about an impending attack, and as a gift, Mark is granted freedom and official entry into their tribe. Mark then discovers that, despite his misconceptions earlier, this world is a ruined Earth, sometime in the future. Meagan's brother gives Mark a shard of a Coca- Cola bottle and the Merkon (leader of Transal) reveals the events between Mark's time and this future, also revealing that he too was sent there by the beam of light. Sometime in the near future, a strange, highly contagious form of the Ebola virus wipes out most of the human race. Those remaining used nuclear armaments on each other, forcing civilization to start over. After severely wounding the Merkon in a sword fight, Mark asks Megan to marry him. However, the Merkon's son has sworn revenge and Mark flees the village to protect them. He leads the Merkon's army to the jungle, away from his new home. Once in the jungle, Mark systematically kills the army but forgets about a scouting party that attacks him. Mark hides behind a boulder for protection and suddenly the boulder is struck by lightning and sends off a charge which brings Mark into his normal time.

Spanos conducted multiple studies that challenged common beliefs. He tried to distinguish the difference between common beliefs about hypnosis and what was actually occurring. These studies conducted by Spanos led to the modern understanding that hypnosis is not an altered state and is actually suggested behaviors that the participant chooses to go along with or not.[Lilienfeld, Scott O. and Hal Arkowitz. \\"Is Hypnosis a Distinct Form of Consciousness?\\" Scientific America.

Biography He was an American by birth and received his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Boston University. He practiced at Medfield State Hospital and with Boston Psychological Associates before joining the Department of Psychology at Carleton in 1975. He wrote 183 journal articles and 19 chapters for textbooks during his career there. He also wrote for Skeptical Inquirer. During this time he contributed to many different studies, one study was the idea that hypnosis is not a trance like state,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LIDJX9-_64 and another dealt with dissociative identity disorder, which tries to explain why some people have multiple personalities. Through his studies Spanos took an alternative approach to most psychologists and John Chaves and Bill Jones stated that he believed these two areas are, \\"rule-governed social constructions established, legitimated, and maintained through social interaction.Carroll, Robert T. \\"Book Review: Multiple Identities and False memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective.\\" The Skeptics Dictionary.AmeriCares, 16 Nov. 1997. Web. 12 Oct. 2013.http://www.skepdic.com/refuge/spanos.html Hypnosis Nonstate position Spanos hypothesized that the behaviors and experiences associated with hypnosis are acted out in accordance with the social context and expectations of the hypnotist and the setting by the person undergoing hypnosis even though they may be sometimes experienced as involuntary. He argued persistently and demonstrated in over 250 experimental studies that hypnotic acts are strongly influenced by the definition of the contexts in which they occur as well as by the cognitive interpretation of the person hypnotized. Spanos argued against Hilgard‚Äôs (and others') belief that hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness or a \\"special\\" or dissociated state of consciousness. Spanos worked for almost thirty years on this theory, first at the Medfield Foundation with Theodore X. Barber, John Chaves and others, and later at Carleton University in Canada. He argued that many of the actions performed under hypnosis can be simply explained by reference to social psychological and cognitive hypotheses (Spanos, 1996). Spanos alleged that there are two reasons why people misconstrue their state of consciousness as hypnosis. One being that people believe their behavior is caused by an external source instead of the self. The second is related to the way hypnotic rituals are performed. The hypnotist says certain things which are first interpreted as voluntary and then later on in the procedure as involuntary. An example being ‚Äúrelax the muscles in your legs‚Äù and then later ‚Äúyour legs feel limp and heavy.‚Äù Spanos argued that the hypnotist asks each person two connected requests. The first directly asking the subject to do something and the second being for the subject to infer the request as an involuntary one. Some hypnosis participants follow the first request and realize they are performing the task voluntarily while others do not respond at all. Still others follow both requests and therefore deemed great hypnosis subjects. Using another study, Spanos demonstrates that people control their hypnotic experience by acting how they believe they are supposed to act during a hypnosis session. The study was performed on two groups of people. One group was given a lecture which included a segment on how arm rigidity was spontaneous during hypnosis and the second group did not. When both groups underwent hypnosis the group who was informed of the arm rigidity demonstrated arm rigidity during the session. A second study used by Spanos involved evaluating the analgesia effect in hypnotic and non-hypnotic individuals. The study performed the experiment on two groups of people and the only difference between the groups is that one group was told they were going to be hypnotized. Each participant was asked to put his or her hand in a bucket of ice and hold it there as long as possible. After removing their arm they were asked to rate their perceived pain. Without hypnosis, those individuals who were expecting hypnosis had a much higher pain rating than those who were not expecting. All participants were 'hypnotized' and then were asked to put their arm in the bucket of ice once more. The people who were not expecting hypnosis had about the same rating of perceived pain as their corresponding non- hypnotic trial. The expecting participants had a much lower rating than their corresponding non-hypnotic trial. Spanos claimed that this was due to the subjects wanting to be viewed as a great hypnotic subject. Spanos‚Äô findings were to contribute to the view that the hypnotic state did not exist at all, and that the behaviors exhibited by those individuals are in fact due to their being ‚Äúhighly motivated‚Äù. Dissociative identity disorder Spanos also contributed to the study of dissociative identity disorder (previously known as multiple personality disorder) through his proposal of the sociocognitive model.Spanos, N. P. (1994). Multiple identity enactments and multiple personality disorder: A sociocognitive perspective. Psychological Bulletin, 116, 143‚Äì165. doi:10.1037/0033-2909.116.1.143 He proposed that exhibiting multiple identities is a social role based upon the norms of a given culture. According to Spanos, hypnosis, spirit possession, and multiple personalities are similar phenomena that represent socially controlled behavior rather than special dissociative or trance states; like other social behaviors, they are learned through observation and interaction within a culture. The sociocognitive explanation for dissociative identity disorder is accepted by some Lilienfeld, S. O., Kirsch, I., Sarbin, T. R., Lynn, S. J., Chaves, J. F., Ganaway, G. K., & Powell, R. A. (1999).

While he was an English writer known primarily for his work on military subjects, he had wide interests. Earlier in his career he was the drama critic for London's Morning Post. Early life and education The second son of Thomas Read Wilkinson, a banker, and his wife Emma Wolfenden, he was born and raised near Manchester. He was educated at Owens College, Manchester and studied at Merton College, Oxford in 1873‚Äì1878. While at Oxford, he became interested in armies and began his lifelong interest in military affairs. As an undergraduate, he joined the Oxford Volunteers. After Oxford, he read law at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1880. On returning to Manchester in 1880, he took a commission in the volunteers and also founded the Manchester Tactical Society. In 1880, Wilkinson married Victoria Crowe (1868‚Äì1929), daughter of Sir Joseph Archer Crowe and niece of the artist Eyre Crowe. Together, he and his wife had two sons and four daughters. Career as a journalist From 1882 to 1892 he was on the staff of the Manchester Guardian, for which he wrote occasional pieces on military subjects and was sent on a short-term assignment to cover Lord Wolseley's campaign in Egypt in 1883. He was made redundant in 1892 because of C.P. Scott's view that Wilkinson did not follow the principles of the Liberal Party. Through his friendship with Lord Roberts, Wilkinson obtained a post on the staff of the London Morning Post from 1895 to 1914. Convinced as early as 1874 that Great Britain was inadequately armed, he increasingly devoted his attention to the subject of the national defence. He became a key figure in the founding of the Navy League of Great Britain in 1894 and a serious student of the German military philosopher Carl von Clausewitz. During the early months of the Boer War (1899‚Äì1900) and made remarkably accurate forecasts of military movements. Wilkinson's views on military affairs were widely influential. At the Foreign Office, Wilkinson's wife's brother, Sir Eyre Crowe, summarised much of Wilkinson's argument from his 1896 book The National Awakening in his famous 1 January 1907 memorandum on British relations with France and Germany. Academic career Wilkinson was very well connected to key figures in politics and in the armed forces as he journalist and had long hoped for an academic appointment, as his interests increasingly turned toward historical study. He was elected the first Chichele Professor of Military History in the University of Oxford and Fellow of All Souls College in 1909. During World War I he became‚Äîlike Clausewitz's foremost German proponent at the time, Hans Delbr√ºck‚Äîan energetic critic of his nation's counterproductive strategy and policy. He remained an influential voice in Britain until his death in 1937.

DeMille and released by Paramount Pictures. Based on the original 1895 play by English playwright Wilson Barrett,See Barrett (1896). the screenplay was written by Waldemar Young and Sidney Buchman. It stars Fredric March, Elissa Landi, Claudette Colbert, and Charles Laughton, with Ian Keith and Arthur Hohl. Both play and film have a strong resemblance to the 1895-96 novel Quo Vadis and, like the novel, take place in ancient Rome during the reign of Nero. The art direction and costume design were by Mitchell Leisen, who also acted as assistant director. Karl Struss was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography.Awards for The Sign of the Cross, IMDB.com; accessed August 5, 2015. It is the third and last in DeMille's biblical trilogy, following The Ten Commandments (1923) and The King of Kings (1927).

The famous scene in which Poppaea (Claudette Colbert) bathes in asses' milk took several days to shoot. DeMille announced to the press that real asses' milk was used; however, it was actually powdered cow's milk. After a few days under the hot lights, the milk turned sour, making it very unpleasant for Colbert to work in the stench. To save production expense during the Great Depression, existing sets were reused as well as costumes left over from the making of The Ten Commandments. DeMille also attempted to provide out-of-work actors jobs as extras such as the crowd arena scenes. Marketing and distribution Paramount marketed the film using market segmentation by focusing their promotion efforts on three market segments. The first was general moviegoers and movie enthusiasts who enjoyed certain features of religiously themed movies, movie goers who regularly attended church, and students of primary and elementary schools. Reception In 2008, the film was nominated for the American Film Institute's 10 Top 10 in the Epic Film category.  Editing for reissue after enforcement of the Production Code  As with many other pre-Code films that were reissued after the Motion Picture Production Code was strictly enforced in 1934, this film has a history of censorship. In the original version, Marcus Superbus (Fredric March) is unsuccessful in his attempt to seduce Mercia (Elisa Landi), an innocent Christian girl. He then urges Ancaria (Joyzelle Joyner) to perform the erotic \\"Dance of the Naked Moon\\" that will \\"warm her into life\\". This \\"lesbian dance\\" was cut from the negative for a 1938 reissue, but was restored by MCA/Universal for its 1993 video release. Some gladiatorial combat footage was also cut for the 1938 reissue, as were arena sequences involving naked women being attacked by crocodiles and a gorilla. These were also restored in 1993. DeMille himself supervised a new version for its 1944 rerelease. New footage with a World War II setting, featuring actor Stanley Ridges (who did not originally appear in the film) was added to make the film more topical. In the new prologue, a group of planes is seen flying over what was ancient Rome. The conversation of the soldiers in one of the planes leads directly into the film's original opening scene. The last few seconds of the edited version of the film showed the planes flying off into the distance, rather than simply fading out on the original closing scene of the movie. For many years, this edited version was the only one available. The version now shown on Turner Classic Movies has been restored to the original 125 minute length by the UCLA Film and Television Archive with the help of the DeMille estate and Universal Television, which now owns most pre-1950 Paramount sound features. Catholic Legion of Decency The reaction of the Catholic Church in the United States to the content in this film and in Ann Vickers helped lead to the 1934 formation of the Catholic Legion of Decency, an organization dedicated to identifying and combating objectionable content, from the point of view of the Church, in motion pictures. Home video release This film, along with Four Frightened People (1934), Cleopatra (1934), The Crusades (1935) and Union Pacific (1939), was released on DVD in 2006 by Universal Studios as part of The Cecil B. DeMille Collection, a new Blu-ray edition will be released on August 25, 2020 by Kino Lorber.

History  Clonard Abbey, situated on the River Boyne in modern County Meath was one of the main monastic schools in early Christian Ireland. During the 6th century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000. Twelve students who studied under St Finian became known as the \\"Twelve Apostles of Ireland\\". This tradition is recorded in the 17th century, possibly based on older sources. The twelve saints are grouped together as such in the text D√° apstol d√©cc na h√ârenn (\\"The Twelve Apostles of Ireland\\", the modern Irish being Dh√° Aspal D√©ag na h√âireann). The text is preserved in a manuscript belonging to Michael O'Clery (Brussels, Biblioth√®que Royale MS 2324‚Äì2340), dated 1629.Van den Gheyn, Joseph, Catalogue des manuscrits de la Biblioth√®que Royale de Belgique vol. 5: Histoire ‚Äî hagiographie, Brussels, Lambertin (1905), 384‚Äì389. In the narrative, the twelve apostles of Ireland are gathered together for a feast in the house of St Finian, a magical flower appears in their midst. It is decided that a voyage to the flower's homeland is to be undertaken by one of them, the choice of person then being determined by casting lots. When, however, the lot falls on the old Brendan of Birr, his younger namesake Brendan moccu Altae goes in his stead.

Sampling has identified three genetically distinct populations. Some feel that the findings should elevate the subspecies to full species status. Taxonomy and etymology Osteolaemus tetraspis is currently the only species included in the monotypic genus Osteolaemus, with two recognized subspecies: * O. t. tetraspis * O. t. osborni ‚Äì Congo (or Osborn's) dwarf crocodile The second subspecies has had a somewhat convoluted taxonomical history. It was first described as Osteoblepharon osborni by Schmidt in 1919, based on a few specimens from the Upper Congo River Basin in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, Inger in a 1948 paper found the specimens wanting of characteristics that would justify a generic separation from Osteolaemus and referred the specimens to Osteolaemus osborni. In 1961, it was reduced to subspecies rank. A study of morphology published in 2007, and studies of DNA in 2009, 2013 and 2015 indicate that three distinctly different populations of Osteolaemus may merit full species recognition. These are O. tetrapis (Central Africa, except the Congo River Basin), O. osborni (Congo River Basin), and a third possibly unnamed species (West Africa). Uncertainty exists for the population in Nigeria (between O. tetrapis and the possibly unnamed West African species) as it has not been studied. A fourth clade was found in a study of captives in 2013, but where members of this clade live in the wild is unclear. In some regions the species may come into contact. For example, Cameroon is home to both O. tetrapis and O. osborni. Etymology The generic name, Osteolaemus, means \\"bony throat\\", and is derived from the Ancient Greek œåœÉœÑŒµŒøŒΩ (bone) and ŒªŒ±ŒπŒºœåœÇ (throat). The genus was named as such due to the osteoderms found among the scales in the neck and belly. The specific epithet, tetraspis, means \\"four shields\\", and derives from the Ancient Greek œÑŒµœÑœÅŒ± (four) and Œ±œÉœÄŒØœÇ (shield), as the back of the neck has four large, shield-like scales. The subspecific name, osborni, is in honor of American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn.Beolens, Bo; Michael Watkins; Michael Grayson (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Osteolaemus osborni, p. 196). Characteristics Dwarf crocrodile at the botanical and zoological garden UAC Benin Skull from the collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis Orange cave-dwelling dwarf crocodile next to a \\"normal\\" aboveground individual in Gabon Dwarf crocodiles attain a medium adult length of , though the maximum recorded length for this species is . Adult specimens typically weigh between , with the largest females weighing up to and the largest males weighing . This makes it the smallest living crocodile species, although the Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), a member of the family Alligatoridae, is smaller at up to about . If the Congo dwarf crocodile (O. osborni) is recognized as a valid species, it would be both the smallest crocodile and the smallest crocodilian since it does not surpass . Adults are all dark above and on their sides, while the underside is yellowish with black patches. Individuals living in caves may have orange patches, apparently due to alkaline bat guano that erodes the skin of the crocodile. Juveniles have a lighter brown banding on body and tails and yellow patterns on the head. As a result of its small size and heightened vulnerability to predation, this species of crocodile has a heavily armoured neck, back, and tail and also has osteoderms on its belly and underside of neck. Osteolaemus has a blunt short snout, as long as it is wide, similar to that of a Cuvier's dwarf caiman, probably a result of occupying a similar ecological niche. The dentition consists of four premaxillary teeth, 12 to 13 on the maxilla, and 14 to 15 on the dentary bone. O. t. tetraspis has lighter colours, a more pointed, upturned snout, and more body armour than O. t. osborni. Distribution and habitat Dwarf crocodile at North Carolina Zoo Dwarf crocodiles range across tropical regions of Sub-Saharan West Africa and Central Africa. Such a distribution greatly overlaps with that of the slender- snouted crocodile, encompassing countries as far west as Senegal, reaching Uganda in the east, and ranging as southerly as Angola. The last confirmed record from Uganda was in the 1940s, but whether the species, which is easily overlooked, still survives there is unclear (it was always marginal in this country, only occurring in the far southwest). Dwarf crocodiles live from lowlands to mid-altitude in streams, small rivers, swamps, pools and mangrove, but generally avoid main sections of large rivers. Most of their range is within forested regions, but it may extend into more open regions where the streams or river are well-shaded. Unlike most crocodiles, dwarf crocodiles only rarely bask in the sun. During the night they may move some distance from water on land. Reports exist of dwarf crocodiles in isolated pools in the savannah. Dwarf crocodiles living long-term in caves are known from western Gabon, which stand out as an isolated genetic group. Biology and behaviour The dwarf crocodile is a timid and mainly nocturnal reptile that spends the day hidden in pools or burrows, although it occasionally may be active during the day. Foraging is mainly done in or near the water, although it is considered to be one of the most terrestrial species of crocodilian and may expand the feeding pattern to land in extensive forays, especially after rains. Dwarf crocodiles are generalist predators and have been recorded feeding on a wide range of small animals such as fish, crabs, frogs, gastropods, insects, lizards, water birds, bats and shrews. In a study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo the primary food item was fish, and in a study in Nigeria the primary food items were gastropods and crabs. In the Congo there is a level of seasonality in its diet, changing from fish in the wet season to crustaceans in the dry season where fish are less available. Plant material has also been found in the stomach of dwarf crocodiles, but it is suspected that this is ingested by accident. They can survive for relatively long periods without food. During the dry season, dwarf crocodiles often retreat to deep holes. True to its solitary, nocturnal nature, a dwarf crocodile digs out a burrow in which to hide and rest during the day, which can sometimes have a submerged entrance. An individual lacking the right conditions to do so usually lives between tree roots that hang over the ponds where it lives. Reproduction Juvenile in Ghana Interacting closely only in breeding season, female dwarf crocodiles build their nest mounds at the beginning of the wet season, which spans May and June. The nest, situated near the water, is a mound of wet, decaying vegetation that incubates the eggs due to the heat generated by the decomposition of the plant material. A small number of eggs is laid, usually about 10, though in extreme cases up to 20, and they incubate in 85 to 105 days. Hatchlings measure 28 cm when emerging from the eggs. The female guards the nest during the incubation period, and after the eggs hatch, she watches over the young for an unknown period of time, as young can be eaten by a great range of predators (birds, fish, mammals and reptiles, including other crocodiles). Conservation The dwarf crocodile is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, and it is listed on Appendix I of CITES. It is a little-known species, so unlike their more studied relatives, conservationists are often not as aware of how their populations are faring under the growing human pressure over the ecosystems where they abide. Survey data, when available, show some degree of decline, either by hunting for bushmeat or habitat loss due to deforestation. However, it is a widely spread, and presumably numerous overall. In some regions the populations remain healthy, but in others (such as Gambia and Liberia) it has seriously declined and may risk extirpation. Dwarf crocodiles occur in several protected reserves. Carcass of dwarf crocodile hanging with monkey. Bushmeat hunting is one of the main threats to the dwarf crocodile. A handbag made from West African dwarf crocodile leather exhibited at the Natural History Museum, London. Hunting for leather is also a main threat to the dwarf crocodile. Though some skins are used in local manufacturing of leather products, they are of poor quality, so little interest is shown in captive breeding or a sustainable use program. In contrast, they are sometimes hunted for food and part of the bushmeat trade. Dwarf crocodiles are widely kept and bred in zoos. Based on a study of individuals kept in AZA zoos, captives in North America are primarily O. tetrapis and the possibly unnamed West African species, but there are also some hybrids. Another study of individuals kept at EAZA zoos revealed a similar picture for Europe, but also that there were a few individuals of the fourth clade (native range in the wild unknown) and a single O. osborni.

The island is named after its three most prominent hills, North, Middle and South Hummock, the latter being the highest with an elevation of above mean sea level. Part of the island is a nature reserve, with the rest a pastoral lease where farming took place from the mid-1800s to at least the mid-1970s. The focus of human settlement on the island is the homestead at Chimney Corner at the westernmost point. There is an automated lighthouse at Cape Rochon in the north-east, as well as roads, three airstrips, fencing and a wharf. Seasonal muttonbirding occurs in March and April.Brothers, Nigel; Pemberton, David; Pryor, Helen; & Halley, Vanessa. (2001). Tasmania‚Äôs Offshore Islands: seabirds and other natural features. Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery: Hobart. Flora and fauna Much of the island is composed of dense scrub dominated by Leptospermum scoparium, Melaleuca ericifolia and Banksia marginata, while 25% of the area is covered by Eucalyptus nitida woodland. The island forms part of the Hunter Island Group Important Bird Area.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Hunter Island Group.

Breeding seabirds and shorebirds include little penguin, short- tailed shearwater, Pacific gull, pied oystercatcher, sooty oystercatcher and hooded plover. Mammals include the introduced eastern grey kangaroo, feral cat and house mouse. Feral sheep were recorded in a 1999 survey. Tiger snakes are also present. European settlement  Warne Family  Elias Albert Warne acquired a lease for the island in 1926. His son Cecil Vernon Warne arrived in February 1926 aboard the Hillsmeads from Melbourne bringing the first ever 500 sheep to the Island, during the following weeks 3 more shipments arrived giving a total of 2,200 sheep. Some cattle were still on the island left by previous leases, they were rounded up, fences repaired and some sold with a bull purchased from Hunter Island. Cecil Warne had married Dulcie Ruby Trevena two years previously in Birchip, Victoria. Dulcie had remained in Melbourne for the birth of their first son Colin Robert on 8 April Cecil returned to Melbourne for the birth and came back with some family members and set about constructing a shearing shed, many fences for sheep pens and even constructed a cement lined ‚Äòsheep dip‚Äô which still exists under a boxthorn hedge. They lived in the house built in 1910 and Dulcie baked bread in the big wood oven, made butter and sold some at times. The old house c1850 was recycled for timber and nails to build the Shearing Shed. Tracks were cleared around the island with only transport being on horseback pulling a sled for new fence posts, tools and sometimes family for a weekend picnic. In 2 September Shearers arrived and helped with final work on the ‚Äòsheep dip‚Äô they spent almost five weeks until all sheep were shorn and dipped, with 48 bales of wool sent off to market aboard the Coomonderry. During their first year (1926) they were able to send to market the following: Cattle 277 Sheep 704 Butter 9 boxes Wool 48 bales Cecil and Dulcie left the island in 1929 and went back to farming in the Mallee. Elias and other members of the Warne family continued time on the island looking after the stock. During 1931 Elias advertised the island for ‚Äòstock agistment‚Äô. An auction was held in 1933 for a new 16-year lease and the Nichols Family commenced their time on the Island. Nichols family Bill and Amelia (\\"Ma\\") Nichols leased Three Hummock Island from 1933 till 1950, and grazed cattle and sheep. They were also involved in fishing and muttonbirding. Over the years they owned several ships including Lady Jean, Lady Flinders, and Jean Nichols which were used to carry cargo and passengers to and from the Bass Strait islands and to Melbourne and Launceston. They built up a small community of workers on the island, including some of their relations. One of these workers was Peggy Puckett, from Stanley. Her story is told in A Walk Along the Shore https://archive.org/details/AWalkAlongTheShore A Walk Along the Shore (Jenny Pearce) in which she describes life on the island with the Nichols family during the six years she lived with them from 1937 to 1943. Mrs Nichols named Peg's Paddock after her, mentioned in both A Walk Along the Shore and Eleanor Alliston's Escape to An Island. The Nichols family left the island in 1950 and the Alliston family arrived in 1951. Alliston family Author Eleanor Alliston wrote Escape to an Island and Island Affair about the life of her family on Three Hummock Island. The two books tell the story of how the Alliston family emigrated from England after the end of World War II to start a new life alone on the island in the hope of providing a better and different childhood for their children. The books have much between the lines left to readers' imaginations.

Export restrictions could be aimed at achieving diverse policy objectives such as environmental protection, economic welfare, social wellbeing, conversion of natural resources, and controlling inflationary pressures. There are various forms of restrictions on export as defined by WTO‚Äôs Trade Policy Reviews (TPR), for example, export duties, quantitative restrictions, voluntary export restrictions, export prohibitions and licensing requirements. Although some countries apply export restriction of various policy purposes, restrictions on exports provide price advantage for the domestic industries because these restrictions create price difference between domestic goods compared to the price of the same goods to foreign investors. Export restrictions don‚Äôt always provide benefits for the country and more income for the government. In the field of agriculture and food sector export restrictions are aimed at protecting the domestic food security from international supply. During the food crises of 2007-2008, more than thirty countries imposed various export restriction measures such as quantitative export restrictions, prohibitions, export taxes, and price controls to protect the domestic food supply. However, this created additional pressures on the food crises by imposing high global prices and affecting the supply of food in the international market. Within Environmental protection sector, export restrictions could cause market failure. For example, if a country puts export restriction on exporting minerals, natural resources, or wood stuff, it could cause market distortion that could also affect the distribution of welfare. Due to this, other countries might enter trade division and pause strict export restrictions on their domestic products which eventually constrains the objective of export restrictions that are supposed to provide positive objectives for the imposing country. . The economic impact of export restrictions The economic impact of the export restrictions depends on the size of the exporter. There are two types of exporters: small exporter (small country), and large exporter (large country). For a small exporter, export restrictions do not affect world market price but rather the domestic price. When there are restrictions on exported goods, the price of exported goods rise, therefore, export decreases and domestic good prices fall. This market failure is beneficial for consumers and is a disadvantage for producers. On the other hand, large exporter has the advantage of affecting the world price. When market prices rise due to export restrictions, the exporter gains from this high price of the goods it exports. Welfare impact of export restrictions Restriction in export causes welfare loss in the national and international levels but the impact of these restrictions differs according to the elasticity of demand and supply of the exported goods and the kind of export restriction measures applied. These welfare losses could be very high when quantitative export restriction measures are applied when there is prohibitions on certain goods that have a low price elasticity of demand, or when there is export taxes on good with very high elasticity of demand. If supply is inelastic, export restrictions of supply increase the price of the good exported on a global level in the short run. However, in the long run, welfare losses will decrease because supply and demand curves will eventually adjust. Impact of Food crises 2008 on export restriction measures The food crises of 2008 affected the export restriction measures on both agricultural and non-agricultural commodities worldwide. These restrictions are changing terms of trade and causing welfare losses on both national and global levels. The reason behind these strict restrictions was related to food security and preventing food shortage. These export measures were a quantitative restriction on export (QRE) and tax on export. An export restriction may be imposed: * To prevent a shortage of goods in the domestic market because it is more profitable to export * To manage the effect on the domestic market of the importing country, which may otherwise impose antidumping duties on the imported goods *As part of foreign policy, for example as a component of trade sanctions *To limit or restrict arms or dual- use items that may be used in proliferation, terrorism, or nuclear, chemical, or biological warfare. *To limit or restrict trade to embargoed nations. In the United States, the Export Administration Regulations are issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security (in the Department of Commerce) for all items except munitions. The Department of State has the responsibility of overseeing export of defense and military-related articles as per the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or ITAR.

The population found south of the mountain ridge, formerly considered a genetically distinct population, is now considered a distinct species, Hall's New Guinea crocodile (C. halli). In the past it included the Philippine crocodile, C. n. mindorensis, as a subspecies, but today they are regarded as separate species. The habitat of the New Guinea crocodile is mostly freshwater swamps and lakes. It is most active at night when it feeds on fish and a range of other small animals. A female crocodile lays a clutch of eggs in a nest composed of vegetation and she lies up nearby to guard the nest. There is some degree of parental care for newly hatched juveniles. This crocodile was over-hunted for its valuable skin in the mid 20th century, but conservation measures have since been put in place, it is reared in ranches and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists it as being of \\"Least Concern\\". Taxonomy and etymology The New Guinea crocodile was first described by the American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time it was thought that there were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the New Guinea crocodile native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, the Philippine crocodile, native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the Philippine crocodile is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the Philippine crocodile is, in part, paraphyletic with regard to the New Guinea crocodile, and that the latter may constitutes a population within the Philippine crocodile. Among their two samples for the New Guinea crocodile, one was part of the Philippine crocodile clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6‚Äì6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution. The genus name Crocodylus comes from the Greek kroko which means a pebble and deilos, a worm or man, referring to the knobbly appearance of the dorsal surface of the reptile. The specific epithet novaeguineae is from the Latin and means \\"of New Guinea\\". Other common names for this crocodile include New Guinea freshwater crocodile, Singapore large grain, Puk Puk, Buaya air tawar and Wahne huala. Phylogeny The cladogram below follows the topology from a 2011 analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences by Robert W. Meredith, Evon R. Hekkala, George Amato and John Gatesy. Description The New Guinea crocodile grows to a length of up to for males and for females, although most specimens are smaller. The body ranges from grey to brown in colour, with darker bandings on the tail and body which become less noticeable as the animal grows. Longitudinal ridges in front of the eyes and some granular scales on the back of the neck between four large scales are distinctive features of this species. There are some differences between the northerly and southerly populations in the morphology of the skull and the arrangement of the scales. The snout is pointed and relatively narrow during juvenile stages and becomes wider as the animal matures. The New Guinea crocodile bears a physical similarity to the nearby Philippine crocodile (C. mindorensis) and Siamese crocodile (C. siamensis). The colouring is similar to that of the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnsoni) of northern Australia, but the snout is somewhat shorter and broader. Distribution and habitat This crocodile is to be found in the freshwater swamps, marshes and lakes of northern New Guinea, particularly in the interior. It has been known to enter brackish waters but is very rare in coastal areas, and never found in the presence of the competing saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). The animal was first described from the area of the Sepik River in the north of Papua New Guinea. The closely related Hall's New Guinea crocodile is found in the southern half of the island, with a range that extends from southeastern Papua New Guinea to the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. It is separated from the New Guinea crocodile by the New Guinea Highlands, a mountain range that runs along the centre of the island. DNA analysis has revealed these to be genetically distinct species, and there are some differences in their morphology and behavior. There are estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 New Guinea and Hall's New Guinea crocodiles in the wild. Behaviour At Bandung Zoo, West Java, Indonesia New Guinea crocodiles have a mostly aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They spend much of the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed. Females become sexually mature when about long and males at about . Eggs are laid about 14 days after mating. In the northern population, breeding takes place during the dry season between August and October. A floating nest composed of vegetation is made in a shallow water location such as in an overgrown channel, at the edge of a lake, on a scroll swale or beside a stream. A clutch of between 22 and 45 eggs is laid and covered with further vegetation. In the southern population, the wet season is chosen for reproduction. The nest is sometimes built in similar locations to the northern nests, but is more often on land, and a smaller number of rather larger eggs is laid. In both populations, the mother stays near the nest during the incubation period, which lasts about 80 days. When the eggs start to hatch, the emerging young are quite vocal, and both male and female crocodiles have been observed transporting hatching and newly hatched young to open water, carrying them delicately in their mouths. Newly hatched New Guinea crocodiles feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, fish and small mammals. As they grow, so does the size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey to the back of the mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and mollusks. Adult and young New Guinea crocodiles have a range of vocalisations. An adult female can produce a repeated throaty \\"roar\\" when approached by another adult. The young start communicating with each other while still in the egg; this may help synchronise hatching. Newly hatched juveniles use various yelps and grunts. When startled, a warning sound emitted by one will send all the juveniles diving to the bottom of the water. Adults in the vicinity respond with growls, threats, and attacks. The distress noises of a youngster when handled at a ranching facility was observed to cause all the larger animals to become involved in frenzied activity, with some rushing towards the juvenile and others thrashing about in the water and slapping their heads down on the surface. Status and conservation At Wuppertal Zoo The IUCN listed this crocodile as being \\"Vulnerable\\" in its Red List of Threatened Species in 1986 and 1988, but changed the assessment to \\"Least Concern\\" in 1996. At the time it was stated that the animal has a large area of suitable habitat and seemed to be plentiful. Its status has not been reassessed since then. It is included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The skin of the New Guinea crocodile is valuable and in the 1950s and 1960s the animals in the northern population were heavily hunted to a point where they might have become extinct. Around 1970, legislation was put in place and they received some protection. In the period 1977 to 1980, the harvest of wild skins was over 20,000 per year but in the 1980s this declined to 12,000 to 20,000. As well as this, some 2,500 to 10,000 eggs and hatchlings were collected annually to raise on ranches. However, in 1995, the largest ranch on the island initiated a change of strategy to concentrate on raising the saltwater crocodile, and demand for the eggs and juveniles of the New Guinea crocodile dried up. Since then, cropping of wild animals has been controlled in both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. In the former it is limited to a belly width of for wet skins and in the latter to salted skins with a belly width of . Some eggs and hatchlings are still removed from the nest and raised in enclosures and a similar programme has more recently been initiated for southern populations. 2018 killing of New Guinea crocodiles In July 2018, a man was reportedly killed by a saltwater crocodile in a breeding farm in West Papua, Indonesia. Locals then killed 292 saltwater and New Guinea crocodiles at the farm in revenge.

It usually grows to about in length. It is a Least Concern species. The species has a fossil record in Guatemala. Taxonomy and etymology Morelet's crocodile was discovered in Mexico in 1850 and named after the French naturalist who made the discovery, Pierre Marie Arthur Morelet (1809‚Äì1892).Beolens, B.; Watkins, M.; Grayson, M. (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Crocodylus moreletii, pp. 182-183). It was long confused with the American and Cuban crocodiles because of similar characteristics and an ambiguous type locality. It was not generally accepted as a separate species until the 1920s. Characteristics Morelet's crocodile has a very broad snout with 66 to 68 teeth when they are fully mature. They are dark grayish-brown in color with dark bands and spots on the body and the tail. This is similar to other crocodiles, like the American crocodile, but the Morelet is somewhat darker. Juvenile crocodiles are bright yellow with some dark bands. The crocodile's iris is silvery brown. They have four short legs, giving them a rather sprawling gait, and a long tail, which is used for swimming. The hind feet of the crocodiles are webbed. They have very explosive capabilities because of their strong muscles and are fast runners. Size Morelet's crocodile is small compared to most other crocodiles. The males can become larger than the females. The average adult Morelet's crocodile is about , with a typical length range of (the lower measurement representing the mean total length of a female at sexual maturity which is attained at roughly 7‚Äì8 years of age in the wild).Platt, S.

Body mass in this species is often around , however this may include possibly overweight captive specimen and average adult body mass in wild adults from Belize was posited as approximately . The weight of a large wild male crocodile is estimated to average in although mass is likely much more in outsized individuals.

Distribution and habitat Morelet's crocodile in the wild next to Lake Coba, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Belize Crocodile in Sch√∂nbrunn Zoo, Vienna Morelet's crocodile can be found in freshwater habitats in Central America and along the Gulf of Mexico stretching through Belize, Guatemala, and to Mexico.Dever, J.

The Belizean pine forests are an example of the type of ecoregion in which they occur.C. Michael Hogan & World Wildlife Fund. 2012. Belizean pine forests. ed. M. McGinley. Encyclopedia of Earth. Washington DC In their freshwater habitats, they prefer isolated areas that are secluded. This species of crocodile can mainly be found in freshwater swamps and marshes, which are located inland, and in large rivers and lakes. Both of these habitats are forested to help add cover. The Morelet can also be found along the coast in brackish waters and the grassy savannas on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. These crocodiles become much more distributed during the rainy seasons when flooding occurs and it is easier for them to move elsewhere. Juvenile crocodiles live in very dense cover to protect them from other predators that might be in the area and will remain there until they become older and able to fend for themselves. Adult crocodiles are known to dig out burrows during dry seasons in their area. The range of this crocodile can overlap with the American crocodile, which can sometimes lead to them being confused with one another. Recently, the Morelet's crocodile has been introduced into the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo in Mexico).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDv1w_izIJA Several newspaper outlets on the Mexican side of the border report of reptiles inhabiting the river appearing not to be the American alligator which is native to Texas, but the Morelet's crocodile which is native to Tamaulipas from San Fernando southward.http://www.hoytamaulipas.net/index.php?v1=notas&v2;=48248http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/internacionales/16513 Crocodiles have been seen in the cities of Matamoros,http://www.elmanana.com/diario/noticia/matamoros/matamoros/capturan_a_cocodrilo_en_casa_de_tamaulipas/1680768http://www.valleycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=332768#.VAi- xGOXLgo Reynosahttp://www.valleycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=191897http://www.hoytamaulipas.net/notas/62708/Capturan- cocodrilo-en-el-Rio-Bravo.htmlhttp://texasuproar.blogspot.com/2008/09/side- step-reynosa-alligator-could- be.htmlhttp://www.valleycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=545212#.VAi4_2OXLgohttp://www.valleycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=516817#.VAi5hmOXLgo and as far north as Nuevo Laredo.http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15194637/ns/technology_and_science- science/t/fishermen-catch-crocodile-rio- grande/http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061009/news_1n9world.html The sightings have prompted several municipal police departments to put up signs warning people about entering the river.http://laprensa.mx/notas.asp?id=19595 Biology and behavior Morelet's crocodile waiting for an ambush. Hunting and diet Like most crocodilians, Morelet's crocodiles are highly opportunistic and will prey on practically anything that they can overpower that comes in their territories.Platt, S. G., Rainwater, T. R., Finger, A. G., Thorbjarnarson, J. B., Anderson, T. A., & McMurry, S. T. (2006). Food habits, ontogenetic dietary partitioning and observations of foraging behaviour of Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) in northern Belize. The Herpetological Journal, 16(3), 281-290. Juvenile crocodiles feed largely on fish and insects until they become bigger and more capable of bringing down larger prey. Adults largely prey on small mammals, birds, and other reptiles as well as gastropods, crustaceans and other invertebrates. These small mammals can include domesticated animals like cats and dogs. Large specimens have been shown to be able to overtake large prey. Dogs and goats have been taken by this species, including a record of a adult killing an English sheepdog which weighed at least .P√©rez-Higareda, G., Rangel-Rangel, A., Smith, H. M., & Chiszar, D. (1989). Comments on the food and feeding habits of Morelet's Crocodile. Copeia, 1039-1041. Adults have also been recorded eating even larger animals, including adult and nearly-grown cattle and an adult tapir, although these have been cases of scavenging on caracasses, with the tapir having been killed by a jaguar (it is possible that the jaguar was present when the crocodile fed).Platt, S. G., Rainwater, T. R., Snider, S., Garel, A., Anderson, T. A., & McMurry, S. T. (2007). Consumption of large mammals by Crocodylus moreletii: field observations of necrophagy and interspecific kleptoparasitism. The Southwestern Naturalist, 52(2), 310-317. Crocodiles have been known to be cannibalistic towards smaller specimens. Although previously thought to be inoffensive, there have been recent reports that the species has attacked humans on multiple occasions and at least 12 documented human fatalities have occurred.https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/cadb-live- feed%40crocbite/?sort=date_of_incident&refine.species;_name=Morelets+Crocodile&refine.outcome;=Fatal Despite the relatively small size of the species, large adult Morelet's are aggressive and easily capable of overpowering an unaware human near the water. Due to partial consumption, recorded fatal attacks are likely predatory rather than defensive in nature.Sideleau (2014).

A preliminary analysis of worldwide crocodilian attacks. In Crocodiles Proceedings of the 21st Working Meeting of the IUCN-SSC Crocodile Specialist Group. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN (pp. 111-114). Reproduction Six-month-old, at Tiergarten Sch√∂nbrunn Breeding usually takes place between April and June and the eggs are laid before the start of the rainy season. Morelet's crocodiles are unique among North American crocodiles in that they build mound nests only, and not mound and hole nests. These mound nests are about wide and high and can be found near the water or on floating vegetation. A female crocodile can lay between 20 and 45 eggs and nests have been found containing eggs from more than one female. The eggs are buried and the nests are guarded by females. The eggs usually hatch after 80 days of incubation and hatchlings are normally about long. After the eggs have hatched the female crocodile will carry her young to the water where they are protected by both parents and will later leave them to fend for themselves. Females are highly protective of their young and have reportedly been observed to aggressively displace intruders and humans if distress calls of the baby crocodiles are heard and even father crocodiles have been observed to spring to the defense of young crocodiles.√Ålvarez del Toro, M. and Sigler L. (2001). Los Crocodylia de M√©xico. IMRNR-PROFEPA: M√©xico, D.F.Rainwater, T.R., McMurry, S.T. and Platt, S.G. (2000). Crocodylus moreletii (Morelet‚Äôs crocodile) behavior. Herpetological Review 31: 237. In captivity, juvenile crocodiles are treated aggressively by adult crocodiles but never hatchlings.Hunt, R. H. (1977). Aggressive behavior by adult morelet's crocodiles Crocodylus moreleti toward young. Herpetologica, 195-201. Conservation Baby Morelet's crocodiles at the Cotswold Wildlife Park, England. Morelet's crocodile has long been threatened by habitat destruction and illegal hunting. Both of these factors have significantly lowered their populations. It was hunted for its hide during the 1940s and 1950s because high quality leather can be made from their skins.Platt, Steven; John Thorbjarnarson. ‚ÄúPopulation status and conservation of Morelet‚Äôs Crocodile, Crocodylus moreletii, in northern Belize‚Äù Biological Conservation. 2000. 96: 21-29. Crocodile leather can be used to make wallets, coats and shoes. One of the key protectors of crocodiles today is the CSG, or Crocodile Specialist Group, started in 1971. This is a worldwide organization of biologist and other professions coming together to conserve the 23 species of alligators and crocodiles. The CSG monitors all trading of crocodile skins and helps determine if the skins are legal or were illegally taken. When this organization started, all of the crocodilian species were either threatened or endangered. Today, those numbers have greatly changed. > By 1996 one third of the crocodilian species were abundant enough to support > regulated annual harvests, another third were no longer in danger of > extinction, but the final one third of the species still remain endangered.

It is the campus radio station of the Universit√© de Moncton. When launched as an FM station, CKUM was originally carried at 105.7 MHz before moving to its present frequency of 93.5 MHz. History In 1971, The University of Moncton launched CKUM Radio as a closed circuit, mono network that was hard-wired throughout the campus and could be tuned in by means of a speaker in rooms throughout the various building on the campus. In 1981, Les M√©dia Acadiens Universitaires Inc. received an FM licence for a new station at the University of Moncton. CKUM would operate on a frequency of 105.7 MHz and have a power of 50 watts. On March 25, 1994, CKUM-FM's application to change frequencies from 105.7 MHz to 94.5 MHz and to increase the effective radiated power from 50 watts to 13,300 watts was denied.Decision CRTC 94-108 The station reapplied a year later to change frequencies from 105.7 MHz to 93.5 MHz at 250 watts and received Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approval on September 21, 1995.Decision CRTC 95-686 The station is a member of the Alliance des radios communautaires du Canada. CKUM \\"2.0\\" (1992) In 1992, CKUM moved from its original home in the Massey House at 195 Massey Avenue to its current home in the University of Moncton Student Centre where specialized studios were designed built to create a then, fully modern radio setup. The Facility CKUM features a 4 studio station consisting of two identical hybrid control rooms and two sound studios. Each control room (Studios A & C) were designed in a manner that they can be used as control rooms for their adjacent sound studios or function independently as a full studio for hosting of programming. Each hybrid control room features a full 12 channel broadcast board as well as 3 microphones. Each hybrid control room also features an adjacent sound booth that is visible through angled windows from the main control board. Studio B, which is the smaller of the studios features a 5-seat table with full microphone and headphone wiring integrated into the furniture and is used for interviews and also as a live news booth. Studio D is a larger studio with full connectivity to its adjacent control room and is used for live performances on the radio and also functions as a recording studio for the production of music. Each studio is built with 5 or 6 non-adjacent walls lined with sound absorption paneling as well as 1 foot thick floors and ceilings that are also fully sound insulted. CKUM 3.0 On the 20th Anniversary of CKUM moving into its current home in the Student Centre, the summer of 2012 marked a new beginning for the collapsing radio stations. CKUM began the processes of modernizing its facilities through a complete revamp of the entire facility. The entire station was painted for the first time since its construction in 1992 using bright colours, the primary on air studio (Studio A) was stripped completely of its aging analog equipment and was completely redone with new furniture and new digital equipment with Studio C scheduled for 2013, making CKUM one of the most advanced facilities in the Moncton area with only stations such as those owned by CBC or Rogers ahead. With these advancements CKUM has moved to the online realm with online web streaming at full 320K MP3 encoded streaming and a fully interactive website that was launched in the fall of 2012.

Geography Bi≈°evo is composed of limestone. The highest point is Stra≈æenica, high, accessible by a 45-minute walk along the footpath. In the center of the island there is a fertile field, the northern part of the island is covered with pine forests and the rest of the island is covered with maquis shrubland or bare rocks. The coastal sea belt is a rich fishing area.Bi≈°evo at dalmacija.net The main industries are viticulture and fishing. History A Benedictine monastery was founded on Bi≈°evo in 1050 by Ivan Grliƒá from Split, but it was deserted two centuries later because of the danger of pirates. The church of Saint Sylvester is preserved near the ruins of the monastery. There was a school on the island, built in 1947 and closed in 1961. Electricity was introduced in the 1970s. Blue Cave On the steep shores there are many caves, the most famous being Blue Cave, which was carved in the limestone by the sea. It is located on the eastern side of the island and is one of the most important attractions of the Adriatic. It was well-known to local fishermen, who in 1884 showed it to the Austrian artist, explorer, and speleologist , who published an article in the Viennese daily Neue Freie Presse declaring that its beauty surpassed even that of Capri's famed Blue Grotto. From that time on, it became a major tourist attraction. The approach to the cave is only possible by boat. It is long, deep, and high. The entrance to the cave is only high and wide. Bi≈°evo on nautic-apartments.com During the summer between 10 am and 1 pm, sunbeams penetrate through the submarine opening in Blue Cave and are reflected from the white bottom floor, coloring the cave blue and objects in the water silver. Monk Seal Cave The Monk Seal Cave by Bisevo island seen from boat The cave is located on the southeast side of the island Bi≈°evo and it has been protected since 1967. The name of the cave originates from the fact that the Mediterranean monk seal massively populated it, today it's an endangered species. It's special geomorphologically because the entrance into the Monk Seal Cave is quite big and wide, it narrows completely towards the interior. The length of the cave is 160m and it ends with a small shore that only small ships as speedboats can reach. This cave is difficult to spot when cruising away from the shore, due to the unusually narrow, almost vertical, thirty meters high opening in the stone gorge. As we come into the tall gate of the cave, guests will enjoy the blue light up the cave interior of the cave as the light penetrates through the passage. Medvidina (Monk Seal) cave is located in the southeastern part of the island, near Cape Biskup. The interior of the cave consists of a main, spacious hall and a low winding canal which, after about seventy meters, ends with a small beach where a sea seal could be found several decades ago.

Salley was Abbot of Eynsham in Oxfordshire in the 1490s. He was appointed Bishop of Llandaff, where he is remembered for his building work at the Bishop's Palace in Mathern in Monmouthshire. He also rebuilt the chancel and south aisle of The Gaunt's Chapel, Bristol, and donated the reredos. Biography Salley was a monk in Abingdon Abbey during the 1480s, and probably entered the decade before as a youth. In 1486, he was caught delivering money to supporters of John de la Pole's Rebellion against Henry VII. Salley was ordered to forfeit all goods and was imprisoned for a time. He was pardoned in 1492, and by 1496 he was acting as almoner and in charge of the kitchen at Abingdon, effectively the fourth most senior monk there. He was elected as abbot of Eynsham Abbey in 1498, and around that time he was given the title of Bishop of Llandaff by the king. In this role, he was able to sit in parliament, was given a house in The Strand, as well as one in Bristol. He attended state occasions, such as the funeral of Henry VII, and Thomas Wolsey's appointment as cardinal. Legacy Salley died in December 1516. His heart and bowels were buried at the high alter in St Tewdric's Church and his body was buried in The Gaunt's Chapel, Bristol, where a fine chest tomb surmounted by his effigy exists on the north wall of the chancel.

Jainism holds that emancipation can only be achieved through meditation or Shukla Dhyana. According to Sagarmal Jain, it aims to reach and remain in a state of \\"pure-self awareness or knowership.\\"Jain, Sagarmal, The Historical development of the Jaina yoga system and the impacts of other Yoga systems on Jaina Yoga, in \\"Christopher Key Chapple (editor), Yoga in Jainism\\" chapter 1. Meditation is also seen as realizing the self, taking the soul to complete freedom, beyond any craving, aversion and/or attachment. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (Gyata-Drashta). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to the auspicious (Dharmya Dhyana and Shukla Dhyana) and inauspicious (Artta and Raudra Dhyana). The 20th century saw the development and spread of new modernist forms of Jain Dhyana, mainly by monks and laypersons of ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara Jainism. Jain meditation is also referred as SƒÅmƒÅyika. A form of this which includes a strong component of scripture study (SvƒÅdhyƒÅya) is mainly promoted by the more conservative Digambara tradition of Jainism. The word SƒÅmƒÅyika means being in the moment of continuous real-time. This act of being conscious of the continual renewal of the universe in general and one's own renewal of the individual living being (Jiva) in particular is the critical first step in the journey towards identification with one's true nature, called the Atman. It is also a method by which one can develop an attitude of harmony and respect towards other humans, animals and Nature. Jains believe meditation has been a core spiritual practice since the teaching of the Tirthankara, Rishabha. All the twenty-four Tirthankaras practiced deep meditation and attained enlightenment. They are all shown in meditative postures in images and idols. Mahavira practiced deep meditation for twelve years and attained enlightenment. The Acaranga Sutra dating to 500 BCE, addresses the meditation system of Jainism in detail.Ahimsa ‚Äì The Science Of Peace by Surendra Bothra 1987 Acharya Bhadrabahu of the 4th century BCE practiced deep Mahaprana meditation for twelve years. Kundakunda of 1st century BCE, opened new dimensions of meditation in Jain tradition through his books such as SamayasƒÅra and Pravachansar.Jain Yoga by Acharya Mahapragya 2004 The 8th century Jain philosopher Haribhadra also contributed to the development of Jain yoga through his Yogad·πõ·π£·π≠isamuccaya, which compares and analyzes various systems of yoga, including Hindu, Buddhist and Jain systems. There are various common postures for Jain meditation, including Padmasana, Ardh-Padmasana, Vajrasana, Sukhasana, standing, and lying down. The 24 Tirthankaras are always seen in one of these two postures in the Kayotsarga (standing) or Padmasana/Paryankasana (Lotus). Ancient history Sagarmal Jain divides the history of Jaina yoga and meditation into five stages, 1. pre-canonical (before sixth century BCE), 2. canonical age (fifth century BCE to fifth century CE), 3. post-canonical (sixth century CE to twelfth century CE), age of tantra and rituals (thirteenth to nineteenth century CE), modern age (20th century on). The main change in the canonical era was that Jain meditation became influenced by Hindu Yogic traditions. Meditation in early Jain literature is a form of austerity and ascetic practice in Jainism, while in the late medieval era the practice adopted ideas from other Indian traditions. According to Paul Dundas, this lack of meditative practices in early Jain texts may be because substantial portions of ancient Jain texts were lost.  Pre-canonical  Mahavira, or VardhamƒÅna (5th century BCE) Gommateshwara statue depicting the meditation in standing Kayotsarga posture by Bahubali. Statue was carved from a single stone fifty-seven feet high in 981 A.D., is located in Karnataka, India Jains believe all twenty-four Tirthankaras (such as Rishabhanatha) practiced deep meditation, some for years, some for months and attained enlightenment. All the statues and pictures of Tirthankaras primarily show them in meditative postures. Jain tradition believes that meditation derives from Rishabhanatha, the first tirthankara. Some scholars have pointed to evidence from Mohenjodaro and Harappa (such as the pashupati seal) as proof that a pre vedic sramanic meditation tradition is very old in ancient India. However, Sagarmal Jain states that it is very difficult to extract the pre-canonical method of Jain meditation from the earliest sources. The earliest mention of yogic practices appear in early Jain canonical texts like the Acaranga, Sutrakritanga and Rsibhasita. The Acaranga for example, mentions TrƒÅ·π≠aka (fixed gaze) meditation, Preksha meditation (self-awareness) and Kayotsarga (‚ÄòkƒÅya·πÉ vosajjama·πágƒÅre‚Äô, giving up the body). The Acaranga also mentions the tapas practice of standing in the heat of the sun (ƒÅtƒÅpanƒÅ). The Acaranga sutra, one of the oldest Jain texts, describes the solitary ascetic meditation of Mahavira before attaining Kevala Jnana as follows: > Giving up the company of all householders whomsoever, he meditated. Asked, > he gave no answer; he went, and did not transgress the right path. (AS 312) > In these places was the wise Sramana for thirteen long years; he meditated > day and night, exerting himself, undisturbed, strenuously. (AS 333) And > Mahavira meditated (persevering) in some posture, without the smallest > motion; he meditated in mental concentration on (the things) above, below, > beside, free from desires. He meditated free from sin and desire, not > attached to sounds or colours; though still an erring mortal (khadmastha), > he wandered about, and never acted carelessly.(AS 374-375) After more than twelve years of austerities and meditation, the AS states that Mahavira entered the state of Kevala Jnana while doing shukla dhayana, the highest form of meditation: > The Venerable Ascetic Mahavira passed twelve years in this way of life; > during the thirteenth year in the second month of summer, in the fourth > fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Vaisakha, on its tenth day called > Suvrata, in the Muhurta called Vigaya, while the moon was in conjunction > with the asterism Uttaraphalguni, when the shadow had turned towards the > east, and the first wake was over, outside of the town Grimbhikagrama, on > the northern bank of the river Rigupalika, in the field of the householder > Samaga, in a north-eastern direction from an old temple, not far from a Sal > tree, in a squatting position with joined heels exposing himself to the heat > of the sun, with the knees high and the head low, in deep meditation, in the > midst of abstract meditation, he reached Nirvana, the complete and full, the > unobstructed, unimpeded, infinite and supreme best knowledge and intuition, > called Kevala. According to Samani Pratibha Pragya, early Jain texts like the UttarƒÅdhyayana- s≈´tra and the ƒÄva≈õyaka-s≈´tra are also important sources for early Jain meditation. The UttarƒÅdhyayana-s≈´tra \\"offers a systematic presentation of four types of meditative practices such as: meditation (dhyƒÅna), abandonment of the body (kƒÅyotsarga), contemplation (anuprek·π£ƒÅ), and reflection (bhƒÅvanƒÅ).\\" Pragya argues that \\"we can conclude that MahƒÅvƒ´ra‚Äôs method of meditation consisted of perception and concentration in isolated places, concentration that sought to be unaffected by physical surroundings as well as emotions.\\" Pragya also notes that fasting was an important practice done alongside meditation. The intense meditation described in these texts \\"is an activity that leads to a state of motionlessness, which is a state of inactivity of body, speech and mind, essential for eliminating karma.\\" The UttarƒÅdhyayana- s≈´tra also describes the practice of contemplation (anuprek·π£ƒÅ). Another meditation described in the ƒÄva≈õyaka-s≈´tra is meditation on the tƒ´rtha·πÖkaras.  Canonical  Umaswati in full lotus posture In this era, the Jain canon was recorded and Jain philosophy systematized. It is clear that Jain meditation and samadhi continued to evolve and to be practiced after the death of Mahavira by figures such as Acharya Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of Maurya Empire who became a Jain monk in old age and a student of Bhadrabahu. It describes Mahavira as practicing intense austerities, fasts (most commonly three days long, as extreme as six months of fasting) and meditations. In one instance he practiced standing meditation for sixteen days and nights. He did this by facing each of the four directions for a period of time, and then turning to face the intermediate directions as well as above and below. This period also sees the elucidation of the practice of contemplation (anuprek·π£ƒÅ) by Kundakunda's VƒÅrassa-a·πáuvekkhƒÅ or ‚ÄúTwelve Contemplations‚Äù (c. 1st century BCE to 1st century CE). These twelve forms of reflection (bhƒÅvanƒÅ) aid in the stopping of the influx of karmas that extend transmigration. These twelve reflections are: #anitya bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì the transitoriness of the world; #a≈õara≈Üa bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì the helplessness of the soul.According to the Jain text, SarvƒÅrthasiddhi: There is no escape for the young one of a deer pounced upon by a hungry tiger fond of the flesh of animals. Similarly, there is no way of escape for the self caught in the meshes of birth, old age, death, disease and sorrow. Even the stout body is helpful in the presence of food, but not in the presence of distress. And wealth acquired by great effort does not accompany the self to the next birth. The friends who have shared the joys and sorrows of an individual cannot save him at his death. His relations all united together cannot give him relief when he is afflicted by ailment. But if he accumulates merit or virtue, it will help him to cross the ocean of misery. Even the lord of devas cannot help anyone at the point of death. Therefore virtue is the only means of succour to one in the midst of misery. Friends, wealth, etc. are also transient. And so there is nothing else except virtue which offers succour to the self. To contemplate thus is the reflection on helplessness. He, who is distressed at the thought that he is utterly helpless, does not identify himself with thoughts of worldly existence. And endeavours to march on the path indicated by the Omniscient Lord. #sa·πÉsƒÅra ‚Äì the pain and suffering implied in transmigration; #aikatva bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì the inability of another to share one‚Äôs suffering and sorrow; #anyatva bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì the distinctiveness between the body and the soul; #a≈õuci bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì the filthiness of the body; #ƒÅsrava bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì influx of karmic matter; #sa·πÉvara bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì stoppage of karmic matter; #nirjarƒÅ bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì gradual shedding of karmic matter; #loka bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì the form and divisions of the universe and the nature of the conditions prevailing in the different regions ‚Äì heavens, hells, and the like; #bodhidurlabha bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì the extreme difficulty in obtaining human birth and, subsequently, in attaining true faith; and #dharma bhƒÅvanƒÅ ‚Äì the truth promulgated by Lord Jina. In his Niyamasara, Acarya Kundakunda, also describes yoga bhakti‚Äîdevotion to the path to liberation‚Äîas the highest form of devotion.Niyamasara [134-40] The Sthananga Sutra (c. 2nd century BCE) gives a summary of four main types of meditation (dhyana) or concentrated thought. The first two are mental or psychological states in which a person may become fully immersed and are causes of bondage. The other two are pure states of meditation and conduct, which are causes of emancipation. They are: # Arta- Dhyana, \\"a mental condition of suffering, agony and anguish.\\" Usually caused by thinking about an object of desire or a painful ailment. # Raudra-Dhyana, associated with cruelty, aggressive and possessive urges. # Dharma-Dhyana, \\"virtuous\\" or \\"customary\\", refers to knowledge of the soul, the non-soul and the universe. Over time this became associated with discriminating knowledge (bheda-vij√±ƒÅna) of the tattvas (truths or fundamental principles). # Sukla- Dhyana (pure or white), divided into (1) Multiple contemplation, (p·πõthaktva- vitarka-savicƒÅra); (2) Unitary contemplation, (aikatva-vitarka-nirvicƒÅra); (3) Subtle infallible physical activity (s≈´k·π£ma-kriyƒÅ-pratipƒÅti); and (4) Irreversible stillness of the soul (vyuparata-kriyƒÅ-anivarti). The first two are said to require knowledge of the lost Jain scriptures known as purvas and thus it is considered by some Jains that pure meditation was no longer possible. The other two forms are said in the Tattvartha sutra to be only accessible to Kevalins (enlightened ones). This broad definition of the term dhyana means that it signifies any state of deep concentration, with good or bad results. Later texts like Umaswati's TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra and Jinabhadra's Dhyana-Sataka (sixth century) also discusses these four dhyanas. This system seems to be uniquely Jain. During this era, a key text was the Tattvarthasutra by Acharya UmƒÅsvƒÅti which codified Jain doctrine. According to the Tattvarthasutra, yoga is the sum of all the activities of mind, speech and body. UmƒÅsvƒÅti (fl. sometime between the 2nd and 5th-century CE) calls yoga the cause of \\"asrava\\" or karmic influxTattvarthasutra [6.2] as well as one of the essentials‚Äîsamyak caritra‚Äîin the path to liberation. UmƒÅsvƒÅti prescribed a threefold path of yoga: right conduct/austerity, right knowledge, right faith. UmƒÅsvƒÅti also defined a series of fourteen stages of spiritual development (gu·πáasthƒÅna), into which he embedded the four fold description of dhyana. These stages culminate in the pure activities of body, speech, and mind (sayogi-kevala), and the \\"cessation of all activity\\" (ayogi-kevala). UmƒÅsvƒÅti also defined meditation in a new way (as ‚ÄòekƒÅgra-cintƒÅ‚Äô): > ‚ÄúConcentration of thought on a single object by a person with good bone- > joints is meditation which lasts an intra-hour (ƒÅ-muh≈´rta)‚Äù Other important figures are Jinabhadra, and Pujyapada Devanandi (wrote the commentary SarvƒÅrthasiddhi). Sagarmal Jain notes that during the canonical age of Jaina meditation, one finds strong analogues with the 8 limbs of Patanjali Yoga, including the yamas and niyamas, through often under different names. Sagarmal also notes that during this period the Yoga systems of Jainism, Buddhism and Patanjali Yoga had many similarities. In spite of this literature, Dundas claims that Jainism never ‚Äúfully developed a culture of true meditative contemplation,‚Äù he further states that later Jaina writers discussed meditation more out of ‚Äútheoretical interest.‚ÄùDundas, Paul (1992). The Jains. First Edition. London and New York: Routledge, 143-4.  Post- canonical  This period saw new texts specifically on Jain meditation and further Hindu influences on Jain yoga. ƒÄcƒÅrya Haribhadra in the 8th century wrote the meditation compendium called Yogad·πõ·π£·π≠isamuccya which discusses systems of Jain yoga, Patanjali Yoga and Buddhist yoga and develops his own unique system that are somewhat similar to these. ƒÄcƒÅrya Haribhadra assimilated many elements from Pata√±jali‚Äôs Yoga-s≈´tra into his new Jain yoga (which also has eight parts) and composed four texts on this topic, Yoga- bindu, Yogad·πõ·π£·π≠isamuccaya, Yoga-≈õataka and Yoga-vi·πÖ≈õikƒÅ. Johannes Bronkhorst considers Haribhadra's contributions a \\"far more drastic departure from the scriptures.\\"Bronkhorst, Johannes (1993). Remarks on the History of Jaina Meditation. In Rudy Smet & Kenji Watanabe (Ed.), Jain Studies in Honour of Jozef Deleu (pp.151-162). Tokyo: Hon-no-Tomosha. He worked with a different definition of yoga than previous Jains, defining yoga as \\"that which connects to liberation\\" and his works allowed Jainism to compete with other religious systems of yoga. The first five stages of Haribhadra's yoga system is preparatory and includes posture and so on. The sixth stage is kƒÅntƒÅ [pleasing] and is similar to Pata√±jali's \\"DhƒÅra·πáƒÅ.\\" It is defined as \\"a higher concentration for the sake of compassion toward others. Pleasure is never found in externals and a beneficial reflection arises. In this state, due to the efficacy of dharma, one‚Äôs conduct becomes purified. One is beloved among beings and single-mindedly devoted to dharma. (YSD, 163) With mind always fixed on scriptural dharma.\\" The seventh stage is radiance (prabhƒÅ), a state of calmness, purification and happiness as well as \\"the discipline of conquering amorous passion, the emergence of strong discrimination, and the power of constant serenity.\\" The final stage of meditation in this system is 'the highest' (parƒÅ), a \\"state of Samadhi in which one becomes free from all attachments and attains liberation.\\" Haribhadra sees this as being in \\"the category of ‚Äúayoga‚Äù (motionlessness), a state which we can compare with the state just prior to liberation.\\" Acarya Haribhadra (as well as the later thinker Hemacandra) also mentions the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga. This has led certain Indologists like Prof. Robert J. Zydenbos to call Jainism, essentially, a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full-fledged religion.Zydenbos, Robert. \\"Jainism Today and Its Future.\\" M√ºnchen: Manya Verlag, 2006. p.66 The five yamas or the constraints of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali bear a resemblance to the five major vows of Jainism, indicating a history of strong cross-fertilization between these traditions.Zydenbos (2006) p.66 Later works also provide their own definitions of meditation. The SarvƒÅrthasiddhi of Akalanka (9 th c. CE) states \\"only the knowledge that shines like an unflickering flame is meditation.\\" According to Samani Pratibha Pragya, the TattvƒÅnu≈õƒÅsana of Ramasena (10th c. CE) states that this knowledge is \\"many-pointed concentration (vyagra) and meditation is one-pointed concentration (ekƒÅgra).\\"  Tantric  The 24 Tirthankaras forming the tantric meditative syllable Hrim, painting on cloth, Gujarat, c. 1800 This period sees tantric influences on Jain meditation, which can be gleaned in the J√±ƒÅnƒÅr·πáava of ≈öubhacandra (11thc. CE), and the Yoga≈õƒÅstra of Hemacandra (12th c. CE). ≈öubhacandra offered a new model of four meditations: # Meditation on the corporeal body (pi·πá·∏çstha), which also includes five concentrations (dhƒÅra·πáƒÅ): on the earth element (pƒÅrthivƒ´), the fire element (ƒÅgneyƒ´), the air element (≈õvasanƒÅ/ mƒÅrutƒ´), the water element (vƒÅru·πáƒ´) and the fifth related to the non-material self (tattvr≈´pavatƒ´). # Meditation on mantric syllables (padastha); # Meditation on the forms of the arhat (r≈´pastha); # Meditation on the pure formless self (r≈´pƒÅtƒ´ta). ≈öubhacandra also discusses breath control and withdrawal of the mind. Modern scholars such as MahƒÅpraj√±a have noted that this system of yoga already existed in ≈öaiva tantra and that ≈öubhacandara developed his system based on the Navacakre≈õvara- tantra and that this system is also present in Abhinavagupta‚Äôs TantrƒÅloka. The Yoga≈õƒÅstra of Hemacandra (12th c. CE) closely follows the model of ≈öubhacandra. This trend of adopting ideas from the BrƒÅhma·πáical and tantric ≈öaiva traditions continues with the work of the later ≈övetƒÅmbara upƒÅdhyƒÅya Ya≈õovijaya (1624‚Äì1688), who wrote many works on yoga. During the 17th century, ƒÄcƒÅrya Vinayavijaya composed the ≈öƒÅnta-sudhƒÅrasabhƒÅvanƒÅ in Sanskrit which teaches sixteen anuprek·π£ƒÅ, or contemplations.  Modern history  Jain Spiritual Retreat, Los Angeles The growth and popularity of mainstream Yoga and Hindu meditation practices influenced a revival in various Jain communities, especially in the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara Terapanth order. These systems sought to \\"promote health and well-being and pacifism, via meditative practices as ‚Äúsecular‚Äù nonreligious tools.\\" 20th century Jain meditation systems were promoted as universal systems accessible to all, drawing on modern elements, using new vocabulary designed to appeal to the lay community, whether Jains or non-Jains. It is important to note that these developments happened mainly among ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara sects, while Digambara groups generally did not develop new modernist meditation systems. Digambara sects instead promote the practice of self-study (SvƒÅdhyƒÅya) as a form of meditation, influenced by the work of Kundakunda. This practice of self study (reciting scriptures and thinking about the meaning) is included in the practice of equanimity (sƒÅmƒÅyika) which is the spiritual practice emphasized by 20th century Digambara sects. The Digambara Jain scholar Kundakunda, in his Pravacanasara states that a Jain mendicant should meditate on \\"I, the pure self\\". Anyone who considers his body or possessions as \\"I am this, this is mine\\" is on the wrong road, while one who meditates, thinking the antithesis and \\"I am not others, they are not mine, I am one knowledge\\" is on the right road to meditating on the \\"soul, the pure self\\".  TerƒÅpanth prek·π£ƒÅ-dhyƒÅna  The modern era saw the rise of a new ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara sect, the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara Terapanth, founded by ƒÄcƒÅrya Bhik·π£u, who was said to be able to practice breath retention (hold his breath) for two hours. He also practiced ƒÅtƒÅpanƒÅ by sitting under the scorching sun for hours while chanting and visualizing yantras. Further Terapanth scholars like JayƒÅcƒÅrya wrote on various meditation practices, including a devotional visualization of the tƒ´rtha·πÖkaras in various colors and ‚Äúawareness of breathing‚Äù (sƒÅsƒÅ-surat), this influenced the later ‚Äúperception of breathing‚Äù (≈õvƒÅsa‚Äìprek·π£ƒÅ) and the meditation on auras (le≈õyƒÅ-dhyƒÅna) of ƒÄcƒÅrya MahƒÅpraj√±a. Tulasƒ´ (1913‚Äì1997) and ƒÄcƒÅrya MahƒÅpraj√±a (1920‚Äì 2010) developed a system termed prek·π£ƒÅ-dhyƒÅna which is a combination of ancient wisdom and modern science. it is based on Jain Canons. It included \\"meditative techniques of perception,Kayotsarg, Anupreksha,mantra, posture (ƒÅsana), breath control (prƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma), hand and body gestures (mudrƒÅ), various bodily locks (bandha), meditation (dhyƒÅna) and reflection (bhƒÅvanƒÅ).\\" The scholar of religion Andrea Jain states that she was convinced that MahƒÅpraj√±a and others across the world were attempting \\"to attract people to preksha dhyana by making it intersect with the global yoga market\\". The key texts of this meditation system are Prek·π£ƒÅ-DhyƒÅna: ƒÄdhƒÅra aura Svar≈´pa (Prek·π£ƒÅ Meditation: Basis and Form, 1980), Prek·π£ƒÅ-DhyƒÅna: Prayoga aura Paddhatti (Prek·π£ƒÅ Meditation: Theory and Practice, 2010) and Prek·π£ƒÅ-DhyƒÅna: Dar≈õana aura Prayoga (Prek·π£ƒÅ Meditation: Philosophy and Practice, 2011). ƒÄcƒÅrya MahƒÅpraj√±a, formulator of Preksha meditation Despite the innovations, the meditation system it is said is firmly grounded in the classic Jain metaphysical mind body dualism in which the self (jiva, characterized by consciousness, cetana which consists of knowledge, j√±ƒÅna and intuition, dar≈õana) is covered over by subtle and gross bodies. Prek·π£ƒÅ means \\"to perceive carefully and profoundly\\". In prek·π£ƒÅ, perception always means an impartial experience bereft of the duality of like and dislike, pleasure and pain, attachment or aversion.Acharya Mahapragya Meditative progress proceeds through the different gross and subtle bodies, differentiating between them and the pure consciousness of jiva. MahƒÅpraj√±a interprets the goal of this to mean to ‚Äúperceive and realise the most subtle aspects of consciousness by your conscious mind (mana).‚Äù Important disciplines in the system are - Synchrony of mental and physical actions or simply present mindedness or complete awareness of one's actions, disciplining the reacting attitude, friendliness, diet, silence, spiritual vigilance.Acharya Mahapragya The mature prek·π£ƒÅ system is taught using an eight limb hierarchical schema, where each one is necessary for practicing the next: # Relaxation (kƒÅyotsarga), abandonment of the body, also ‚Äúrelaxation (≈õithilƒ´kara·πáa) with self-awareness,‚Äù allows vital force (prƒÅ·πáa) to flow. # Internal Journey (antaryƒÅtrƒÅ), this is based on the practice of directing the flow of vital energy (prƒÅ·πáa-≈õakti) in an upward direction, interpreted as being connected with the nervous system. # Perception of Breathing (≈õvƒÅsaprekon), of two types: (1) perception of long or deep breathing (dƒ´rgha-≈õvƒÅsa-prek·π£ƒÅ) and (2) perception of breathing through alternate nostrils (samav·πõtti-≈õvƒÅsa-prek·π£ƒÅ). # Perception of Body (≈õarƒ´raprek·π£ƒÅ), one becomes aware of the gross physical body (audƒÅrika- ≈õarƒ´ra), the fiery body (taijasa-≈õarƒ´ra) and karmic body (karma·πáa-≈õarƒ´ra), this practice allows one to perceive the self through the body. # Perception of Psychic Centres (caitanyakendra-prek·π£ƒÅ), defined as locations in the subtle body that contain ‚Äòdense consciousness‚Äô (saghana-cetanƒÅ), which MahƒÅpraj√±a maps into the endocrine system. # Perception of Psychic Colors (le≈õyƒÅ-dhyƒÅna), these are subtle consciousness radiations of the soul, which can be malevolent or benevolent and can be transformed. # Auto-Suggestion (bhƒÅvanƒÅ), MahƒÅpraj√±a defines bhƒÅvanƒÅ as ‚Äúrepeated verbal reflection‚Äù, infusing the psyche (citta) with ideas through strong resolve and generating \\"counter-vibrations\\" which eliminate evil impulses. # Contemplation (anuprek·π£ƒÅ), contemplations are combined with the previous steps of dhyana in different ways. The contemplations can often be secular in nature. A few important contemplation themes are - Impermanence, Solitariness, and Vulnerability. Regular practice is believed to strengthen the immune system and build up stamina to resist against aging, pollution, viruses, diseases. Meditation practice is an important part of the daily lives of the religion's monks.J. Zaveri What is Preksha? . .jzaveri.com. Retrieved on: 25 August 2007. MahƒÅpraj√±a also taught subsidiary limbs to prek·π£ƒÅ-dhyƒÅna which would help support the meditations in a holistic manner, these are Prek·π£ƒÅ-yoga (posture and breathing control) and Prek·π£ƒÅ-cikitsƒÅ (therapy). Mantras such as Arham are also used in this system.  Other traditions  CitrabhƒÅnu (b. 1922) was a Jain monk who moved to the West in 1971, and founded the first Jain meditation center in the world, the Jaina Meditation International Centre in New York City. He eventually married and became a lay teacher of a new system called \\"Jain meditation\\" (JM), on which he wrote various books. The core of his system consists of three steps (tripadƒ´): 1. who am I? (kohum), 2. I am not that (nahum) (not non-self), 3. I am that (sohum) (I am the self). He also makes use of classic Jain meditations such as the twelve reflections (thought taught in a more optimistic, modern way), Jaina mantras, meditation on the seven chakras, as well as Hatha Yoga techniques. ƒÄcƒÅrya Su≈õƒ´lakumƒÅra (1926‚Äì1994) of the SthƒÅnakavƒÅsƒ´ tradition founded ‚ÄúArhum Yoga‚Äù (Yoga on Omniscient) and established a Jain community called the ‚ÄúArhat Sa·πÖgha‚Äù in New Jersey in 1974. His meditation system is strongly tantric and employs mantras (mainly the namaskƒÅr), nyasa, visualization and chakras. The SthƒÅnakavƒÅsƒ´ ƒÄcƒÅrya NƒÅnƒÅlƒÅla (1920‚Äì1999), developed a Jaina meditation called Samƒ´k·π£a·πáa-dhyƒÅna (looking at thoroughly, close investigation) in 1981. The main goal of samƒ´k·π£a·πáa-dhyƒÅna is the experience of higher consciousness within the self and liberation in this life. Samƒ´k·π£a·πáa-dhyƒÅna is classified into two categories: introspection of the passions (ka·π£ƒÅya samƒ´k·π£a·πáa) and samatƒÅ-samƒ´k·π£a·πáa, which includes introspection of the senses (indriya samƒ´k·π£a·πáa), introspection of the vow (vrata samƒ´k·π£a·πáa) introspection of the karma (karma samƒ´k·π£a·πáa), introspection of the Self (ƒÅtma samƒ´k·π£a·πáa) and others. Bhadra·πÖkaravijaya (1903‚Äì1975) of the TapƒÅgaccha sect founded ‚ÄúSƒÅlambana DhyƒÅna‚Äù (Support Meditation). According to Samani Pratibha Pragya, most of these practices \\"seem to be a deritualisation of p≈´jƒÅ in a meditative form, i.e. he recommended the mental performance of p≈´jƒÅ.\\" These practices (totally 34 different meditations) focus on meditating on arihantas and can make use of mantras, hymns (stotra), statues (m≈´rti) and diagrams (yantra). ƒÄcƒÅrya ≈öivamuni (b. 1942) of the ≈örama·πáa Sa·πÖgha is known for his contribution of ‚ÄúƒÄtma DhyƒÅna‚Äù (Self-Meditation). The focus in this system is directly meditating on the nature of the self, making use of the mantra so‚Äôham and using the Acaranga sutra as the main doctrinal source. Muni CandraprabhasƒÅgara (b. 1962) introduced ‚ÄúSambodhi DhyƒÅna‚Äù (Enlightenment- Meditation) in 1997. It mainly makes use of the mantra Om, breathing meditation, the chakras and other yogic practices.  SƒÅmƒÅyika  Jain nuns meditating The name SƒÅmƒÅyika, the term for Jain meditation, is derived from the term samaya \\"time\\" in Prakrit. Jains also use samayika to denote the practice of meditation. The aim of SƒÅmƒÅyika is to transcend our daily experiences as the \\"constantly changing\\" human beings, called Jiva, and allow identification with the \\"changeless\\" reality in practitioner, called the atman. One of the main goals of SƒÅmƒÅyika is to inculcate equanimity, to see all the events equanimously. It encourages to be consistently spiritually vigilant. SƒÅmƒÅyika is practiced in all the Jain sects and communities. Samayika is an important practice during Paryushana, a special eight- or ten- day period.  For householders  In Jainism, six essential duties are prescribed for a ≈õrƒÅvaka (householder), out of which one duty is Samayika. These help the laity in achieving the principle of ahimsa which is necessary for his/her spiritual upliftment. The sƒÅmayika vrata (vow to meditate) is intended to be observed three times a day if possible; other-wise at least once daily. Its objective is to enable the ≈õrƒÅvaka to abstain from all kinds of sins during the period of time fixed for its observance. The usual duration of the sƒÅmayika vow is an antara m≈´harta (a period of time not exceeding 48 minutes). During this period, which the layman spends in study and meditation, he vows to refrain from the commission of the five kinds of sin ‚Äî injury, falsehood, theft, unchastity and love of material possessions in any of the three ways. These three ways are:- *by an act of mind, speech or body (krita), *inciting others to commit such an act (kƒÅrita), *approving the commission of such an act by others (anumodanƒÅ). In performing sƒÅmayika the ≈õrƒÅvaka has to stand facing north or east and bow to the Pa√±ca-Parame·π£·π≠hi. He then sit down and recites the Namokara mantra a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in: *pratikramana, recounting the sins committed and repenting for them, *pratyƒÅkhyanƒÅ, resolving to avoid particular sins in future, *sƒÅmayika karma, renunciation of personal attachments, and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body and thing alike, *stuti, praising the four and twenty Tƒ´rthankaras, *vandanƒÅ, devotion to a particular Tirthankara, and *kƒÅyotsarga, withdrawal of attention from the body (physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the contemplation of the spiritual Self. SƒÅmayika can be performed anywhere- a temple, private residence, forest and the like. But the place shouldn't be open to disturbance. According to the Jain text, Ratnakaranda ≈õrƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅra, while performing sƒÅmayika, one should meditate on:  For ascetics  The ascetic has to perform the sƒÅmƒÅyika three times a day. Champat Rai Jain in his book, The Key of Knowledge wrote: Techniques According to the some commonly practiced yoga systems, high concentration is reached by meditating in an easy (preferably lotus) posture in seclusion and staring without blinking at the rising sun, a point on the wall, or the tip of the nose, and as long as one can keep the mind away from the outer world, this strengthens concentration. Garuda is the name Jainism gives to the yoga of self-discipline and discipline of mind, body and speech, so that even earth, water, fire and air can come under one‚Äôs control. ≈öiva is in Jainism control over the passions and the acquisition of such self-discipline that under all circumstances equanimity is maintained. PrƒÅnayƒÅma ‚Äì breathing exercises ‚Äì are performed to strengthen the flows of life energy. Through this, the elements of the constitution ‚Äì earth, water, fire and air ‚Äì are also strengthened. At the same time the five chakras are controlled. PrƒÅnayƒÅma also helps to stabilize one‚Äôs thinking and leads to unhampered direct experience of the events around us. Next one practices pratyƒÅhƒÅra. PratyƒÅhƒÅra means that one directs the senses away from the enjoyment of sensual and mental objects. The senses are part of the nervous system, and their task is to send data to the brain through which the mind as well as the soul is provided with information. The mind tends to enjoy this at the cost of the soul as well as the body. PratyƒÅhƒÅra is obtained by focusing the mind on one point for the purpose of receiving impulses: on the eyes, ears, tip of the nose, the brow, the navel, the head, the heart or the palate. Contemplation is an important wing in Jain meditation. The practitioner meditates or reflects deeply on subtle facts or philosophical aspects. The first type is Agnya vichƒÅya, in which one meditates deeply on the seven elementary facts - life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of karmas, and the final accomplishment of liberation. The second is Apaya vichƒÅya, in which incorrect insights and behavior in which ‚Äúsleeping souls‚Äù indulge, are reflected upon. The third is Vipaka vichƒÅya dharma dhyƒÅna, in which one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of karma. The fourth is Sansathan vichƒÅya dharma dhyƒÅna, when one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul, which has had to face the results of its own causes all alone. A few important contemplation themes in Preksha meditation are - Impermanence, Solitariness, Vulnerability. Picture depicting Pindastha Dhyana In pindƒÅstha-dhyƒÅna one imagines oneself sitting all alone in the middle of a vast ocean of milk on a lotus flower, meditating on the soul. There are no living beings around whatsoever. The lotus is identical to Jamb≈´dvƒ´pa, with Mount Meru as its stalk. Next the meditator imagines a 16-petalled lotus at the level of his navel, and on each petal are printed the (Sanskrit) letters ‚Äúarham‚Äú and also an inverted lotus of 8 petals at the location of his heart. Suddenly the lotus on which one is seated flares up at the navel and flames gradually rise up to the inverted lotus, burning its petals with a rising golden flame which not only burns his or her body, but also the inverted lotus at the heart. The flames rise further up to the throat whirling in the shape of a swastika and then reach the head, burning it entirely, while taking the form of a three-sided pyramid of golden flames above the head, piercing the skull sharp end straight up. The whole physical body is charred, and everything turns into glowing ashes. Thus the pinda or body is burnt off and the pure soul survives. Then suddenly a strong wind blows off all the ashes; and one imagines that a heavy rain shower washes all the ashes away, and the pure soul remains seated on the lotus. That pure Soul has infinite virtues, it is Myself. Why should I get polluted at all? One tries to remain in his purest nature. This is called pindƒÅstha dhyƒÅna, in which one ponders the reality of feeling and experiencing. In padƒÅstha dhyƒÅna one focuses on some mantras, words or themes. Couple of important mantra examples are, OM - it signifies remembrance of the five classes of spiritual beings (the embodied and non-embodied Jinas, the ascetics, the monks and the nuns), pronouncing the word ‚ÄúArham‚Äù makes one feel ‚ÄúI myself am the omniscient soul‚Äù and one tries to improve one‚Äôs character accordingly. One may also pronounce the holy name of an arhat and concentrate on the universal richness of the soul. In r≈´pƒÅstha dhyƒÅna one reflects on the embodiments of arihants, the svayambhuva (the self-realized), the omniscients and other enlightened people and their attributes, such as three umbrellas and whiskers ‚Äì as seen in many icons ‚Äì unconcerned about one‚Äôs own body, but almighty and benevolent to all living beings, destroyer of attachment, enmity, etc. Thus the meditator as a human being concentrates his or her attention on the virtues of the omniscients to acquire the same virtues for himself. R≈´pƒÅtita dhyƒÅna is a meditation in which one focuses on bodiless objects such as the liberated souls or siddhas, which stand individually and collectively for the infinite qualities that such souls have earned. That omniscient, potent, omnipresent, liberated and untainted soul is called a nira√±jƒÅna, and this stage can be achieved by right vision, right knowledge and right conduct only. Right vision, right knowledge and right conduct begin the fourth stage of the 14-fold path. The ultimate aim of such yoga and meditation is to pave the way for the spiritual elevation and salvation of the soul. Some yogis develop their own methods for meditation.

History Aerial view (1955) Raron is first mentioned around 1101‚Äì1200 as Rarogni. In 1146 it was mentioned as Rarun. A settlement on the Heidnischbiel, a burial ground at Blatt and scattered finds in the surrounding vineyards indicate that there was a permanent settlement in the vicinity of Raron from the Neolithic to the La T√®ne period. The settlement seems to have been abandoned in the Roman era. During the Middle Ages, the hill west of the Heidnischbiel, was fortified. In the 12th century the Viztum of Raron was established and the Viztume tower house was added to the hill. The tower The families of Raron, Asperlin and de Chevron-Villette all held the office of Vizedominat of Raron as a fief from the Bishop of Sion. During the Raron affair of 1417, the tower was partially destroyed. It was purchased in 1538 by the municipality and then served as city hall and a jail. At the beginning of the 21st Century it was privately owned. In addition, to the Viztume tower, the Meier tower was built in the 13th century. The Meier tower was mostly occupied by the Asperlin family. Raron was important in local politics and held the title Raronia prudens. One bishop and several provincial governors came from Raron. The center of the local parish was, most likely, originally St. German. The church of St. German existed since about the 8th or 9th centuries. By 1299, the church in Raron had become a parish church. This large parish comprised the four municipalities of the middle third of the Zenden of Raron. In 1554, Unterb√§ch and B√ºrchen separated from the parish and in 1867 Ausserberg left as well. The entire Church of St. Romanus, except the tower, was destroyed in 1494 when the Bietschbach flooded. The tower of the church remained until 1938, when it was demolished. The uninhabited Meier tower was converted into a gothic church by Ulrich Ruffiner in 1508‚Äì1514. In the early 16th century, this castle church was dedicated to St. Romanus to replace the earlier church. The restored castle church was abandoned in the 1970s and was replaced in 1974 a modern rock church, which was built at the foot of the hill. Maxenhaus The big stone houses of Raron testify to the prosperity of the 17th and 18th centuries. These historic houses include the Maxenhaus, the Zentriegenhaus, the Zmilacherhaus and houses of the von Roten family as well as the Kalbermatterhaus in Turtig and the tower house in Rotigoblatt. Traffic through Raron over the St. German pass to Visp contributed to the prosperity of the town. However, the construction of the valley road to the left side of the valley in the 19th century, deprived Raron of this source of revenue. Due to the containment of the Rhone and Bietschbach rivers, the draining of the swamps in 1865‚Äì1885 and the construction of the Lonza Entsumpfungs canal in 1920, the valley opened up for agriculture. Raron evolved in the second half of the 20th century into a modern industrial and small business town. Residential and commercial buildings spread out across the valley floor. In the 1940s a military airfield for the Swiss Air Force was built in the valley with an aircraft cavern, but it was abandoned in the army reform of 1994. Air Zermatt established a helicopter base in Raron in 1980. The south portal of the L√∂tschberg Base Tunnel was opened to the east of the village in 2007. In 2000 more than 60% of the working population worked outside of the municipality, especially in Visp, Brig and Steg. Raron is known for periodic Passion and Mysteries of the Rosary plays.

It is their only album on the major label DGC Records, and was Jawbreaker's final album before their 21-year breakup from 1996 to 2017. Singer/guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach underwent surgery on his vocal cords shortly before the recording of Dear You. Containing much less raspy vocals, the record had higher production values compared to the band's previous albums. Schwarzenbach later confirmed that the move to DGC was necessary for the band to stay around, as they had been on the verge of breaking up. Reception At the time of the album's release, much of the band's pre- existing fanbase did not receive the album well. As Jawbreaker had made many previous comments to the media declaring their disdain of the major-label music industry‚Äìclaiming many times that they would not sign to a major label‚Äìmany fans saw the band signing to DGC Records (for a reported advance of one million dollars) as a \\"betrayal.\\" The slicker production, courtesy of a producer known at the time for working with Green Day, and Schwarzenbach's changed vocal style, did not go over well with many fans who did give the album a chance. After Jawbreaker's breakup, many of these same fans came to reconsider the album in the context of the band's legacy, and changed their opinion to a more positive view.

Chinese Connection 2, Fist of Fury Part II and Tschang Fu, der Todeshammer (Tschang Fu, the hammer of death) in germany), is a 1977 Hong Kong kung fu film directed by Iksan Lahardi and Tso-nam Lee, and starring Bruce Li and Lo Lieh. It is the sequel to Bruce Lee‚Äôs 1972's Fist of Fury. The lead role of Chen Shan, played by Bruce Li, who goes to Shanghai to mourn his brother's death who was killed at the hands of the Japanese. Chen Shan then avenges his brother by killing the Japanese. The final fight between Chen Shan and Miyamoto, played by Lo Lieh, is generally thought of as disappointing compared to other fights in the film as it is slow and long. This film is generally regarded as one of Bruce Li's other better films. It was not as well received as its predecessor but was thought to be much better than Jackie Chan‚Äôs New Fist of Fury. Another sequel was released in 1979, titled Fist of Fury III (a.k.a. Chinese Connection III). Plot After Chen Zhen's execution in Shanghai, the Japanese feared that his death would unite all Chinese kung fu schools against them. Fearing this, the Japanese gave orders to the head of the Hong Ku School, Miyamoto (Lo Lieh) to suppress all the Chinese schools including the Ching Wu School. Miyamoto sends the Japanese along with their interpreter to the Ching Wu School ordering the leader & students to leave the School. When they refuse, the Japanese beat up the students and destroy the school. Meanwhile, one Chinese man learns about the destruction of the Ching Wu School when he goes to Shanghai to visit Chen Zhen's grave. This Chinese man is the only one who has the guts to fight the Japanese, this Chinese is known as Chen Shan (Bruce Li) who is the brother of Chen Zhen and he vows to avenge his brother's death and end the terror of the Japanese once and for all.

The final duel with Miyamoto is well staged and takes place at the Ching Wu school All in all a worthy sequel to a great Kung Fu classic.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20091028103931/http://geocities.com/many_bruces/brucelizine/index.htm Also admiring is Dean Medows, who wrote in his three-part Bruceploitation essay in Impact Magazine: \\"Fist of Fury 2 is a movie that is still regarded as one of the very finest examples of Bruce Lee exploitation cinema. With martial arts skills constantly improving, including his earlier limited nunchaku use, Li was now firmly established as the pioneer of Bruceploitation.\\" Trivia *The adventures of Chen Shen were continued in the 1979 film Fist of Fury III. *Bruce Li has said that out of all the movies he made, this was one of only three that he liked (the other two were Dynamo and The Chinese Stuntman. *There is some debate as to when this film was released. IMDb lists the release year as 1977, but the Hong Kong release date on 5 April 1979 (which is also the year that the Hong Kong Movie Database lists). Some websites say the film was from as early as 1976. *IMDb credits the directors as Iksan Lahardi and Tso-nam Lee, while the Hong Kong Movie Database credits Siu Fung, and other websites credit Jimmy Shaw. *Nora Miao's part in Fist of Fury is played in this movie by a different woman (she is the only woman in the film) whose face is concealed by a hood, she killed herself near the beginning of the film. *While veteran Fist of Fury actors Nora Miao and Han Ying-chieh acted in the \\"official\\" sequel in 1976 film New Fist of Fury (with the former playing her same character while Han played a new character), fellow veteran Fist of Fury actors Tien Feng and Li Kun reprised their roles for this film. *The set of the Ching-Wu school, seen in Fist of Fury, was recreated for this film, and appears very similar to the original film. *There is an infamous moment in some prints in where Chen Shan takes a pair of nunchaku out of a Ching-Wu student's hands and the nunchaku suddenly disappear. This is due to a ban on nunchaku scenes in the United Kingdom. The UK video version has apparently been the source of the US DVDs but some UK tapes were released uncut. Ironically, one of the most widely seen publicity photos from this film involves Bruce Li holding said weapon. *Due to Fist of Fury III being released on video in the US by Video Gems under the title Fist of Fury II, there has been frequent confusion as to which film is really the first sequel to the original Fist of Fury. However, the Chinese title of this film translates as Jing Wu Men sequel.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox in 2008. Career Zink was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Boston Red Sox in 2002 upon recommendation of former Red Sox pitcher Luis Tiant, who coached Zink at Savannah College of Art and Design. After joining the organization, former Red Sox starting pitcher and fellow knuckleballer Tim Wakefield also spent time with Zink, primarily during their spring break and the off-season. Zink began his career with the independent Yuma Bullfrogs in 2001. After signing with the Red Sox, Zink was the 2003 Sarasota Pitcher of the Year with a 3.90 ERA over 136 innings, the most he has thrown in a season at any level of play to date. In 2005, he went a combined 10-6 with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox and Double-A Portland Sea Dogs. Zink spent most of the 2006 season with Pawtucket, pitching 23 of 25 games there, posting a 9‚Äì4 record and a 4.03 ERA. Zink split time between Portland and Triple-A Pawtucket in 2007. He opened the season with the PawSox, but was sent down to Portland on May 21. After posting a 9-3 record and a 3.98 ERA in Double-A, Zink was transferred back to Triple-A Pawtucket on August 3. Zink was used solely as a starter in 2007, whereas in previous seasons he was occasionally used out of the bullpen. Zink showed signs of brilliance during his time with Portland during May and June. At one point, he had compiled 8 starts of at least 5 innings pitched and only once allowed more than 3 earned runs during that stretch. A strained leg muscle caused him to miss a start, but in his first start after returning from the disabled list he surrendered a career high 12 earned runs in 4 innings.

Kitchin was a monk at Westminster Abbey, before becoming Prior of Gloucester Hall, Oxford. He was appointed Abbot of Eynsham in 1530, but lost the post at his abbey's dissolution in 1539. He was granted an unusually large pension of ¬£133-6s-8d pa. Six years later, in 1545, Kitchin was made Bishop of Llandaff. He was subsequently said to have impoverished the diocese by selling off much of its property.KITCHIN, ANTHONY (alias Dunstan before his consecration), 1477 - 1563; bishop of Llandaff, 1545-63Houses of Benedictine monks: The abbey of EynshamKITCHIN, ANTHONY (alias Dunstan before his consecration), 1477 - 1563; bishop of Llandaff, 1545-63 He retained his see under Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth. Alone of all the English bishops, he took the oath of Royal supremacy on the accession of the last. His willingness to follow the opinion of whichever monarch reigned has led many to accuse Kitchin of being spineless. Indeed, one historian has written of Kitchin that he was a 'timeserver who would doubtless have become a Hindu if required, provided he was allowed to hold on to the See of Llandaff' (Eamon Duffy, 'Fires of Faith', p. 23). However, he showed some backbone in opposing Elizabeth's appointment of Matthew Parker to the See of Canterbury (cf. Nag's Head Fable); apparently, his acquiescence in religious matters had its limits. Kitchin died at the Bishop's Palace in Mathern on 31 October 1563 at the age of 92 and was buried there. He was one of the last known people born in the reign of Edward IV, and he is also one of the few known to have been born before the accession of Henry VII and to live into the reign of Elizabeth I.

The song was produced, arranged, composed and performed by Prince with Morris Day later adding his lead vocals. The funk song opens with a brief drum fill and has several throughout the song, along with drum machines. The beat is somewhat of a march, which is emphasized by Day during the song's break by mimicking an army chant. The \\"walking\\" bass of the song is perhaps inspired by the song's title. The keyboards take an important role, as well as plenty of rock guitar. Despite the song being performed nearly entirely by Prince, several band members are called out throughout the song (Jellybean Johnson and Terry Lewis) giving the song a live feel. The ending of the song is a humorous conversation between Morris Day and Denise Matthews, lead singer of Vanity 6. Prince himself also makes an appearance as an Italian club owner.

Loaded was released on December 12, 1995 on the PlayStation, and was ported to the Sega Saturn the following year. The game had origins in DC Comics as well as the more adult-orientated Vertigo Comics, and there was a small graphic novel based on the game. The six playable characters of the game are a combination of villains, anti-heroes, psychopaths, perverts, mutants, and flamboyant murderers. They are, however, the best hope to stop the intergalactic supervillain nicknamed F.U.B. and save the universe. The characters were created and designed with contributions from Garth Ennis of Vertigo Comics and Greg Staples of 2000AD. The game was notorious for its macabre sense of humor, over-the-top violence and gore, and lighting effects, but was often criticized for the repetitiveness of its gameplay. Later in the same year the game spawned a sequel using almost entirely the same characters and the same game engine, albeit one with mildly improved graphics, titled Re-Loaded. Plot F.U.B. was once a catering officer with the Sector Marines. F.U.B. (which stands \\"Fat Ugly Boy\\") was once on a barren desert front during one of the relatively obscure skirmishes of the last 40 years. Not wanting to let \\"the boys\\" down and unable to find any meat, F.U.B., cooked his own legs and served them up in a rich broth. Despite it being the best dish he had ever created, F.U.B. was given an unconditional discharge and asked never to show his face again. F.U.B. replaces his legs with, hydraulic-powered replacements. He undertakes a radical appearance; wearing furry dice, smoking Havana cigars and painting a target on his portly belly. The six playable characters have notable differences and derangements, but what they have in common is that they are all psychotic criminals who have been setup by F.U.B. and are now serving sentence on an inhospitable prison planet, the planet Raulf. F.U.B. has even taken on a new identity, working his way up the ladder by murder, and is now the warden of Raulf. The player (or two of the game's six characters, in two player mode) must escape Raulf, chase F.U.B. and engage on a bloody odyssey across the strange worlds of the galaxy to exact revenge on F.U.B. The supervillain, however, sees it as a challenge, and to this end he creates a machine that can toy with the very fabric of the universe, manipulate matter, and even open doorways to other dimensions. With this machine, F.U.B. plans to hold the universe for ransom and sets up a prison break on Raulf to set things in motion. If he can defeat a group of the most feared individuals in the galaxy who are armed to the teeth and wanting revenge, he figures he can defeat anyone. Gameplay The game features levels across fifteen different worlds and has six playable characters: Mamma, Fwank, Bounca, Vox, Butch and Cap'n Hands. Two characters may be selected in co-operative mode to complete the game. A mission briefing plays at the start of every mission, aided by a full motion video sequence. Loaded's gameplay is almost identical to that of Gauntlet, which requires the player to move room to room killing everything in sight, everything of which will try to kill the player also. Score can be increased by looting the bloodied remains of enemies. There are some puzzle and exploration elements, and power-ups and ammo can be found. The levels progress by collecting keycards capable of unlocking doors. The player can zoom in to their character by pressing R2, or zoom out by pressing L2. At the end of each level, the game tallies the player's greed factor, accuracy and body count on a 0‚Äì100% scale in order to give the player's career prospects (ranging from as low as \\"social worker\\" to as high as \\"genocidal maniac\\", etc.) and final score. Development and marketing Loaded was developed by Gremlin Interactive, a British software house based in Sheffield which had previously had a successful run in developing games. Loaded and its sequel Re-Loaded would be among the last games developed by Gremlin Interactive, before it was acquired by French giant Infogrames for ¬£24 million, and the studio in Sheffield closed. Development took place over less than a year. The game was published in North America by US-based Interplay. A demo of Loaded was included on a demo disc bundled with the PlayStation in Europe. The main character design and graphics were done by a host of comic book illustrators like Les Spink and Greg Staples (of 2000AD fame). Interplay collaborated with DC Comics to create a 12-page novella illustrated with the game's artwork to promote it and introduce the characters and the game premise.Loaded promo comic. Internet Archive. The book was published bundled with DC's works at the time and DC signed adult-orientated Vertigo Comics star Garth Ennis to write it. The novella is now considered a collector's item. The game was released for the Sega Saturn over a year after the PlayStation version appeared. Asked to explain this delay, Interplay producer Jeremy Airey stated, \\"A year ago, we were worried if the Saturn was even going to do well. As of late, [Saturn sales] have picked up. Also, when we started doing Loaded [for the] Saturn, it looked horrible. With the new Sega libraries, Loaded looks and plays good.\\" Soundtrack Loaded features 21 compositions by Neil Biggin, plus 2 tracks by Patrick (Pat) Phelan and 2 more by Pop Will Eat Itself (Kick to Kill and RSVP). The game was specially designed so that it could be placed inside a CD player and used as an audio CD (skipping Track 1 which contained the code for the game). This would then enable the listener to play the full soundtrack - including many hidden tracks and two of which were complete tracks from the Amiga CD32 version of Zool 2 (Mount Ices and Mental Block's house), another game by Gremlin. There are 25 audio tracks in total on the CD, the hidden tracks were brief demos and were never used in-game. Reception The original release for PlayStation met with mostly positive reviews. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly compared it favorably to Smash TV and cited the multiplayer mode as the game's most enjoyable feature. Major Mike of GamePro deemed it \\"a simple premise taken to absurd heights: From the wacky characters to the overblown carnage, the game is generally a blast to play. While it lacks some of the strategy of similar-minded titles like Doom, the action hardly ever lets up.\\" He also extensively praised the graphics, particularly noting the strong details, zoom feature, and light sourcing effects. While they complimented the animated environments and four-player option, Maximum had an overall subdued reaction to the game, saying it is much more repetitive than similar games such as Alien Breed and The Chaos Engine. A reviewer for Next Generation also commented on the repetitiveness, saying that the 15 levels look different but all play the same. However, the review was generally complimentary, commenting on the \\"blistering pace\\" of the gameplay, smooth and detailed graphics, light- sourcing effects, and soundtrack which \\"is among the best we've heard in years\\". Most critics commented that the Saturn version successfully replicated the graphical effects and other technical aspects of the PlayStation version, with a notable exception in Tommy Glide of GamePro, who said the graphics are not as smooth and do not zoom as easily. However, Next Generation and Dan Hsu and Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly said that Loaded was not as good as it seemed in the wake of its original release on the PlayStation, and that the game's graphics, soundtrack, and shock value were not enough to keep the mindless gameplay from quickly becoming boring. In a reassessment roughly a year after the PlayStation version's release, Next Generation lowered its score to three out of five stars (the same as the Saturn version). Hugh Sterbakov of GameSpot and Rad Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine agreed that the game is mindless and repetitive, but held that in the field of simplistic shooters it is a success. Electronic Gaming Monthly editors named the Saturn version a runner-up for Best Music of 1996 (behind Wipeout XL). Loaded was a commercial success, with the PlayStation version shipping 250,000 copies the week of its release. In the USA alone, the PlayStation version sold over 140,000 copies. Sequel Less than a year after the original game was released, a sequel was released also for the PlayStation and DOS entitled Re- Loaded, developed and published by the same companies.

The hypothesis specifically states that a spot exchange rate is expected to change equally in the opposite direction of the interest rate differential; thus, the currency of the country with the higher nominal interest rate is expected to depreciate against the currency of the country with the lower nominal interest rate, as higher nominal interest rates reflect an expectation of inflation. Derivation of the International Fisher effect The International Fisher effect is an extension of the Fisher effect hypothesized by American economist Irving Fisher. The Fisher effect states that a change in a country's expected inflation rate will result in a proportionate change in the country's interest rate :(1+i) = (1+r) \\\\times (1+E[\\\\pi]) where :i is the nominal interest rate :r is the real interest rate :E[\\\\pi] is the expected inflation rate This may be arranged as follows :i + 1 = 1 + E[\\\\pi] + r + r E[\\\\pi] When the inflation rate is low, the term r E[\\\\pi] will be negligible. This suggests that the expected inflation rate is approximately equal to the difference between the nominal and real interest rates in any given country :E[\\\\pi] \\\\approx i - r Let us assume that the real interest rate is equal across two countries (the US and Germany for example) due to capital mobility, such that r_\\\\$ = r_\\\\euro. Then substituting the approximate relationship above into the relative purchasing power parity formula results in the formal equation for the International Fisher effect :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta S(\\\\$/\\\\euro)}{S(\\\\$/\\\\euro)} = \\\\frac{i_\\\\$ - i_\\\\euro}{1 + i_\\\\euro} \\\\approx i_\\\\$ - i_\\\\euro where S refers to the spot exchange rate. This relationship tells us that the rate of change in the exchange rate between two countries is approximately equal to the difference in those countries' interest rates. Relation to interest rate parity Combining the international Fisher effect with uncovered interest rate parity yields the following equation: :E(e) = \\\\frac {E(S_{t+k})} {S_t} - 1 = \\\\frac {(i_\\\\$ - i_\\\\euro)} {(1 + i_\\\\euro)} where :E(S_{t+k}) is the expected future spot exchange rate :S_t is the spot exchange rate Combining the International Fisher effect with covered interest rate parity yields the equation for unbiasedness hypothesis, where the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate.: :\\\\frac {F_{t,T}} {S_t} - 1 = \\\\frac {(i_\\\\$ - i_\\\\euro)} {(1 + i_\\\\euro)} = E(e) where :F_{t,T} is the forward exchange rate. Example Suppose the current spot exchange rate between the United States and the United Kingdom is 1.4339 GBP/USD. Also suppose the current interest rates are 5 percent in the U.S. and 7 percent in the U.K. What is the expected spot exchange rate 12 months from now according to the international Fisher effect? The effect estimates future exchange rates based on the relationship between nominal interest rates. Multiplying the current spot exchange rate by the nominal annual U.S. interest rate and dividing by the nominal annual U.K. interest rate yields the estimate of the spot exchange rate 12 months from now: :\\\\$1.4339 \\\\times \\\\frac {(1 + 5\\\\%)} {(1 + 7\\\\%)} = \\\\$1.4071 To check this example, use the formal or rearranged expressions of the international Fisher effect on the given interest rates: :E(e) = \\\\frac {(5\\\\% - 7\\\\%)} {(1 + 7\\\\%)} = -0.018692 = -1.87\\\\% :E(e) = \\\\frac {(1 + 5\\\\%)} {(1 + 7\\\\%)} - 1 = -0.018692 = -1.87\\\\% The expected percentage change in the exchange rate is a depreciation of 1.87% for the GBP (it now only costs $1.4071 to purchase 1 GBP rather than $1.4339), which is consistent with the expectation that the value of the currency in the country with a higher interest rate will depreciate.

Under an agreement concluded on 8 October 1963, the Sultan relinquished sovereignty over his remaining territory in Kenya. On 12 January 1964, Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah was deposed and lost sovereignty over the last of his dominions, Zanzibar.  History  Founding of the Sultanate In 1698, Zanzibar became part of the overseas holdings of Oman after Saif bin Sultan, the Imam of Oman, defeated the Portuguese in Mombasa, in what is now Kenya. In 1832 or 1840, Omani ruler Said bin Sultan moved his court from Muscat to Stone Town on the island of Unguja (that is, Zanzibar Island). He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island's slave labour. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said, struggled over the succession, so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate realms. Thuwaini became the Sultan of Muscat and Oman while Majid became the first Sultan of Zanzibar, but obliged to pay an annual tribute to the Omani court in Muscat. During his 14-year reign as Sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the local slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin Said, helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country's infrastructure. The third Sultan, Khalifa bin Said, also furthered the country's progress toward abolishing slavery. According to the 16th- century explorer Leo Africanus, Zanzibar (Zanguebar) was the term used by Arabs and Persians to refer to the eastern African coast running from southern Somalia to northern Mozambique, dominated by five semi-independent Muslim kingdoms: Mombasa, Malindi, Kilwa, Mozambique, and Sofala. Africanus further noted that they all had standing agreements of loyalty with the major central African states, including the Kingdom of Mutapa. Context for the Sultan's loss of control over his dominions Zanzibar's Sultanate c. 1875 Until 1884, the Sultans of Zanzibar controlled a substantial portion of the Swahili Coast, known as Zanj, and trading routes extending further into the continent, as far as Kindu on the Congo River. That year, however, the Society for German Colonization forced local chiefs on the mainland to agree to German protection, prompting Sultan Bargash bin Said to protest. Coinciding with the Berlin Conference and the Scramble for Africa, further German interest in the area was soon shown in 1885 by the arrival of the newly created German East Africa Company, which had a mission to colonize the area. In 1886, the British and Germans secretly met and discussed their aims of expansion in the African Great Lakes, with spheres of influence already agreed upon the year before, with the British to take what would become the East Africa Protectorate (now Kenya) and the Germans to take present-day Tanzania. Both powers leased coastal territory from Zanzibar and established trading stations and outposts. Over the next few years, all of the mainland possessions of Zanzibar came to be administered by European imperial powers, beginning in 1888 when the Imperial British East Africa Company took over administration of Mombasa. The same year the German East Africa Company acquired formal direct rule over the coastal area previously submitted to German protection. This resulted in a native uprising, the Abushiri Revolt, which was crushed by a joint Anglo- German naval operation which heralded the end of Zanzibar's influence on the mainland. Island of Unguja and the African mainland  1890 - Establishment by the British of the Zanzibar Protectorate on part of the Sultan's dominions With the signing of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between the United Kingdom and the German Empire in 1890, Zanzibar itself became a British protectorate. In August 1896, following the death of Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini, Britain and Zanzibar fought a 38-minute war, the shortest in recorded history. A struggle for succession took place as the Sultan's cousin Khalid bin Barghash seized power. The British instead wanted Hamoud bin Mohammed to become Sultan, believing that he would be much easier to work with. The British gave Khalid an hour to vacate the Sultan's palace in Stone Town. Khalid failed to do so, and instead assembled an army of 2,800 men to fight the British. The British launched an attack on the palace and other locations around the city after which Khalid retreated and later went into exile. Hamoud was then peacefully installed as Sultan. That \\"Zanzibar\\" for these purposes included the coastal strip of Kenya that would later become the Protectorate of Kenya was a matter recorded in the parliamentary debates at the time.  1895 - Establishment by the British of the East Africa Protectorate on part of the Sultan's dominions The Harem and Tower Harbour of Zanzibar (p.234), London Missionary Society In 1886, the British government encouraged William Mackinnon, who already had an agreement with the Sultan and whose shipping company traded extensively in the African Great Lakes, to establish British influence in the region. He formed a British East Africa Association which led to the Imperial British East Africa Company being chartered in 1888 and given the original grant to administer the territory. It administered about of coastline stretching from the River Jubba via Mombasa to German East Africa which were leased from the Sultan. The British \\"sphere of influence\\", agreed at the Berlin Conference of 1885, extended up the coast and inland across the future Kenya and after 1890 included Uganda as well. Mombasa was the administrative centre at this time. However, the company began to fail, and on 1 July 1895 the British government proclaimed a protectorate, the East Africa Protectorate, the administration being transferred to the Foreign Office. In 1902 administration was again transferred to the Colonial Office and the Uganda territory was incorporated as part of the protectorate also. In 1897 Lord Delamere, the pioneer of white settlement, arrived in the Kenya highlands, which was then part of the Protectorate. Lord Delamere was impressed by the agricultural possibilities of the area. In 1902 the boundaries of the Protectorate were extended to include what was previously the Eastern Province of Uganda.East Africa Order in Council, 1902, S.R.O. 1902 No. 661, S.R.O. ^ S.I. Rev. 246 Also, in 1902, the East Africa Syndicate received a grant of to promote white settlement in the Highlands. Lord Delamere now commenced extensive farming operations, and in 1905, when a large number of new settlers arrived from England and South Africa, the Protectorate was transferred from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. The capital was shifted from Mombasa to Nairobi in 1905. A regular Government and Legislature were constituted by Order in Council in 1906. This constituted the administrator a governor and provided for legislative and executive councils. Lieutenant Colonel J. Hayes Sadler was the first governor and commander in chief. There were occasional troubles with local tribes but the country was opened up by the Government and the colonists with little bloodshed. After the First World War, more farmers arrived from England and South Africa, and by 1919 the European population was estimated at 9,000 settlers. 1920 - Sultan loses sovereignty over what became the Colony of Kenya On 23 July 1920, the inland areas of the East Africa Protectorate were annexed as British dominions by Order in Council.Kenya (Annexation) Order in Council, 1920, S.R.O. 1902 No. 661, S.R.O. & S.I. Rev. 246. That part of the former Protectorate was thereby constituted as the Colony of Kenya and from that time, the Sultan of Zanzibar ceased to be sovereign over that territory. The remaining wide coastal strip (with the exception of Witu) remained a Protectorate under an agreement with the Sultan of Zanzibar.Agreement of 14 June 1890: State pp. vol. 82. p. 653 That coastal strip, remaining under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar, was constituted as the Protectorate of Kenya in 1920.Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920 S.R.O. 1920 No. 2343, S.R.O. & S.I. Rev. VIII, 258, State Pp., Vol. 87 p. 968 The Protectorate of Kenya was governed as part of the Colony of Kenya by virtue of an agreement between the United Kingdom and the Sultan dated 14 December 1895.Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920, S.R.O. 1920 No. 2343 & S.I. Rev. VIII, 258, State Pp., Vol. 87, p.968. In summary, the \\"Colony of Kenya\\" referred to the interior lands. The \\"Protectorate of Kenya\\" was a coastal strip together with certain islands which remained under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar until the independence of Kenya. 1963 - Sultan cedes sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963. The United Kingdom ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya and, under an agreement dated 8 October 1963, the Sultan agreed that simultaneous with independence for Kenya, the Sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya.HC Deb 22 November 1963 vol 684 cc1329-400 wherein the UK Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and for the Colonies stated\\" \\"An agreement was then signed on 8 October 1963, providing that on the date when Kenya became independent the territories composing the Kenya Coastal Strip would become part of Kenya proper.\\" In this way, Kenya became an independent country under the Kenya Independence Act 1963. Exactly 12 months later on 12 December 1964, Kenya became a republic under the name \\"Republic of Kenya\\". 1963/1964 - Zanzibar Protectorate ended and Sultan deposed Independence stamp overprinted \\"Republic\\" On 10 December 1963, the Protectorate that had existed over Zanzibar since 1890 was terminated by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom did not grant Zanzibar independence, as such, because the UK never had sovereignty over Zanzibar. Rather, by the Zanzibar Act 1963 of the United Kingdom,Zanzibar Act 1963: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/55/contents/ the UK ended the Protectorate and made provision for full-self government in Zanzibar as an independent country within the Commonwealth. Upon the Protectorate being abolished, Zanzibar became a constitutional monarchy under the Sultan. Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah was overthrown a month later during the Zanzibar Revolution. Jamshid fled into exile, and the Sultanate was replaced by the People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba. In April 1964, the existence of this socialist republic was ended with its union with Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which became known as Tanzania six months later. Demographics By 1964, the country was a constitutional monarchy ruled by Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah. Zanzibar had a population of around 230,000 natives, some of whom claimed Persian ancestry and were known locally as Shirazis. It also contained significant minorities in the 50,000 Arabs and 20,000 South Asians who were prominent in business and trade. The various ethnic groups were becoming mixed and the distinctions between them had blurred; according to one historian, an important reason for the general support for Sultan Jamshid was his family's ethnic diversity. However, the island's Arab inhabitants, as the major landowners, were generally wealthier than the natives; the major political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines, with Arabs dominating the Zanzibar Nationalist Party (ZNP) and natives the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP).

Biography Thuringia Buschmann was born in Friedrichroda, Thuringia. His father, Johann Buschmann, was a passementier, who later started to fix musical Instruments and in 1816 developed the uranion later called terpodion, a friction instrument played with a piano-like keyboard, based on the same principle as the glass harmonica. From 1819 Johann took Friedrich with him on his frequent journeys. Berlin In the first half of 1821 Johann Buschmann travelled to London, accompanied by his son Friedrich, and agreed to a ¬£1,000 contract with a Mr. L√∂schmann besides taking other orders for terpodions. On their return the Buschmanns set up a workshop in Berlin, Eduard did stay in Berlin and Friedrich was on a tour through Germany up to 1829 or even a bit longer. He was already skilled and experienced enough at musical instrument construction to begin building terpodions and aeolins as the letters written by him and his Father make clear. The first evidence of the word Aeoline we find in a letter dated 28 December 1828. Altogether, 25 terpodions were built, most of them by Friedrich. His brother Eduard worked mainly on the wooden cases and inlays, and was in charge of the appearance of the instruments, though the brothers lived and worked in different German cities. Nearly all the terpodions ever built are still in existence in different European museums. Johann and Friedrich meanwhile continued their advertising journeys throughout Europe. Besides their performances, they had to service the instruments they had already sold, as they did not function very reliably over a longer period. This may well have been a principal reason why Friedrich was looking for other methods of reliable sound generation for tuning purposes. On Tour Mentioned towns or Villages while on Tour, are: Aachen, Barmen, Elberfeld (which today are part of Wuppertal), L√ºdenscheid, Werben, Altena, Breckerfeld, V√∂rde, Langenberge, D√ºsseldorf, K√∂ln, Preu√ü-Minden and Rinteln. While still in V√∂rde near Barmen and on tour with his Father in 1828 Friedrich built an instrument, originally intended only for use as accompanying instrument, which at first consisted of 21 different metal free reeds fastened to a wooden block in such a way that it was possible to blow the reeds individually. He fastening the reeds inside a small box \\"4 inches square and equally high\\" Letter to his brother dated 21 December 1828 (in other words a cubic box with 4\\" sides), each of which could be made to vibrate by blowing through 21 individual \\"tone chambers\\" (Tonlochkanzellen). This instrument he named an aeoline. The earliest experiments with the aeoline may have taken place in 1824, when it has been claimed that Buschmann built a tuning aid named an aura, about 4 inches long and equipped with 15 reed tongues. (The name Aura was also then in use in German to mean a jaw harp). But no written evidence can be found to support this. While still in Rinteln, in Buschmann's letters to his sun Eduard, it appears that Friedrich built a bigger version of an aeoline in 1829, with bellows and piano keyboard of two octaves, which, being about the size of a small writing desk, was still much smaller than any comparable fixed key instrument they had built previously. It is certain that they must have become aware of all kinds of modern developments in this area as they travelled through different countries, which contributed to Friedrich's further refinement of the physharmonica. The Buschmanns knew of an instrument built at about this time by Johann Caspar Schlimbach, an instrument maker trained in Vienna, and his cousin Bernhard Eschenbach in K√∂nigshofen in Bavaria: this was a pianoforte with an aeoline register. Schlimbach made no attempt to protect his invention, but freely showed the instrument to everyone who wanted to see it, with the inevitable result that a number of people patented very similar instruments in Vienna. Indeed, Buschmann's father Johann wrote in a letter of 30 October 1829 that he was thinking of taking out a patent for the new instrument in Bavaria. Hamburg In 1833 Friedrich Buschmann married Sophie Volkmar. Her brother Gustav Hermann Joseph Philipp Volkmar was a well known music theoretician in Germany and later in Switzerland. The Family and her Father Adam Valentin Volkmar lived in Rinteln from 1917 on. Friedrich and Sophie moved to Hamburg, where he opened a new workshop of his own. There he made mostly physharmonicas, bellows-operated wind instruments, each of which also had a large manual keyboard. For a physharmonica with built-in terpodion he won the Great Gold Medal at the Hamburg Arts and Trades Exhibition of 1838. Terpodions, tuningadds and pianofortes ware also built. He died in Hamburg in 1864. The harmonica There is a persistent legend that Buschmann invented the harmonica (and the accordion) but this cannot be substantiated. Buschmann states in a letter of 1828 that he had just invented a new instrument, but the manufacture of harmonicas had begun some years previously in Vienna: \\"There is documentary evidence that harmonicas were being sold in Vienna in 1825...\\" \\"Nachweislich wurden Mundharmonikas ... 1825 in Wien verkauft.\\" Restle, Conny (2002) In aller Munde: Mundharmonika, Handharmonika, Harmonium ; eine 200-j√§hrige Erfolgsgeschichte (In All Mouths: Mouthorgans, Accordions, Harmoniums; A 200-year History), p.43, Staatliches Institut f√ºr Musikforschung, Berlin Nor, in his impressively well-documented family history, was Buschmann able to confirm the story (see Sources).

This \\"Augustine\\" was born in Ireland sometime in the first half of the seventh century and is noted especially for his natural philosophy. Around the year 655 he wrote a treatise called De mirabilibus Sacrae Scripturae. It has long been regarded as an exceptional work, in that it demonstrates a strictly scientific approach in the matter of making direct observations of nature and subjecting them to a strictly logical interpretation. His treatise seeks to explain each miracle in the Scriptures as an extreme case of phenomena, yet still within the laws of nature.

Al-'Ayni is an abbreviation for al-'AyntƒÅbi, referring to his native city. Biography He was born into a scholarly family in 762 AH (1360 CE) in the city of 'AyntƒÅb (now Gaziantep in modern Turkey).Al-'Ayni, al-Sayf al-Muhammad fƒ´ Sƒ´rat al-Malik al-Mu'ayyad, ed. Fal≈´m Muhammad Shalt≈´t (Cairo, 1967.) He studied history, adab, and Islamic religious sciences, and was fluent in Turkish. There is some evidence that he also knew at least some Persian.Anne F. Broadbridge, \\"Academic Rivalry and the Patronage System in Fifteenth- Century Egypt\\", Mamluk Studies Review,Vol. 3 (1999), Note 4. In 788 AH (1386 CE) he travelled to Jerusalem, where he met the Hanafi shaykh al-SayrƒÅmƒ´, who was the head of the newly established ZƒÅhiriyah madrasah (school) and khƒÅnqah (Sufi retreat) in Cairo. Al-Sayrami invited al-'Ayni to accompany him home to Cairo, where he became one of the Sufis of the ZƒÅhiriyah.Ibn Taghrƒ´birdƒ´, al- Nuj≈´m al-ZƒÅhirah fƒ´ Mul≈´k Misr wa-al-Qahirah (Beirut, 1992.) This was a step upward for the young al-'Ayni, as it represented entry into \\"an institution with ties to the highest level of the ruling elite.\\"Broadbridge, p.87. He established a good reputation and initially met with favor. However, after al- SayrƒÅmƒ´ died in 790 AH (1388 CE), al-'Ayni became involved in a personality conflict with the amir JƒÅrkas al-Khalƒ´lƒ´, who tried to run him out of Cairo.Al-SƒÅkhawƒ´, al Daw' al-Lami' li-Ahl al-Qarn al-Tasi' (Cairo, date not given.) Al-'Ayni later described al-Khalƒ´lƒ´ as arrogant and dictatorial ‚Äì \\"a man pleased by his own opinion.\\"Ibn Taghrƒ´birdƒ´, quoting al-'Ayni in al-Nuj≈´m al-ZƒÅhirah fƒ´ Mul≈´k Misr wa-al-Qahirah (Beirut, 1992), 4:207. He was saved from expulsion by one of his teachers, Siraj al-Din al-Bulqini, but prudently decided to leave for a time anyway.Al-'Ayni, al-Sayf al-Muhammad, editor's introduction, p. li. From Cairo he went to teach in Damascus, where he was appointed muhtasib (overseer of sharia in the marketplace) by the amir,Al-'Ayni, 'Iqd al-JumƒÅn fƒ´ Ta'rikh Ahl al-Zam√°n, ed. 'Abd al-RƒÅziq al- TanrƒÅwi al-Qarm≈´t (Cairo, 1985.) and returned to Cairo some time before 800 AH (1398 CE.) Once back in Cairo, al-'Ayni strengthened his social and political position by associating with several amirs, making the Hajj with the amir TamarbughƒÅ al-Masht≈´b.Ibn Taghrƒ´birdƒ´, al-Manhal al-SƒÅfi al-Muhammad fƒ´ Sirat al-Malik al-Mu'ayyad, ed. Muhammad Muhammad Amin (Cairo, 1984), 1:417. He also had the patronage of the powerful amir Jakm min 'Awd, who was dawadƒÅr (literally \\"inkstand-holder\\": a secretary or confidential advisor) to the Sultan Barq≈´q.Ibn Taghrƒ´birdƒ´, al-Manhal al-SƒÅfi, 4:313‚Äì22. After the death of Barq≈´q, al-'Ayni became the muhtasib of Cairo, displacing the scholar al- Maqrƒ´zƒ´. According to al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´ (an interested party) it was Jakm who obtained the post for al-'Ayni;al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´, KitƒÅb al-Sul√∫k li-Ma'rifat Duwal al-Mul√∫k, ed. Sa'id ƒÄsh≈´r (Cairo, 1973), 3:2:740. however, the historian Ibn Taghribƒ´rdƒ´ states that it was a cooperative effort by Jakm and two other amirs, QalamtƒÅy al-'UthmƒÅnƒ´ and Taghribƒ´rdƒ´ al-Qurdamƒ´.Ibn Taghribƒ´rdƒ´, al- Nuj≈´m, 15:287. In any case, this was the beginning of a lifelong feud between the two ulama : \\"From that day on, there was hostility between the two men until they both died.\\" Al-'Ayni and al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´ succeeded each other as muhtasib of Cairo several times over the next few years, probably a reflection of the power struggle between Jakm min 'Awd and al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´'s patron, Yashbak al-Sha'bƒÅnƒ´.Broadbridge, pp.89‚Äì90, \\"The Muhtasib Incident\\". Neither held the post for very long. In the reign of al-Nasir Faraj, Barq≈´q's son and successor, al-'Ayni was appointed to the \\"lucrative and prestigious\\"Broadbridge, p.91. post of nƒÅzir al-ahbas (overseer of pious endowments.) He would be dismissed from and reappointed to this post several times, finally securing it for good in the reign of Sultan Mu'ayyad Shaykh and keeping it until he was ninety-one.Ibn Taghribƒ´rdƒ´, History of Egypt 1382‚Äì1467, trans. William Popper, University of California (Berkeley, 1958.) Al-'Ayni's prestige grew as he aged. Mu'ayyad Shaykh named him ambassador to the Qaramanids in 823 AH (1420 CE.) Later in life he would be called upon to lecture on learned topics before the Sultan, sometimes reading history aloud in Arabic and explaining it in Turkish for the Sultan's benefit.Al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´, KitƒÅb al-Sul≈´k, 4:2:698. Sultan al-Ashraf BarsbƒÅy is reported to have said \\"Islam is known only through him\\"Al-SakhƒÅwi, \\"al-I'lƒÅn bi-al-Tawdƒ´h li Man Damma Ahl al-TƒÅrikh,\\" edited and translated by Franz Rosenthal in A History of Muslim Historiography (Leiden, 1952.) and law lƒÅ al-'ayntƒÅbi la-kƒÅna fƒ´ islƒÅmina shay', \\"If not for al-'Ayntabi there would be something suspect in our Islam.\\"Ibn Taghribƒ´rdƒ´, al-Nuj≈´m, 15:287; trans. Broadbridge, p. 96. BarsbƒÅy sometimes sent al-'Ayni as his representative to greet foreign dignitaries, apparently because of his fluency in several languages.Al-'Ayni, 'Iqd al-JumƒÅn, 2:21. BarsbƒÅy often turned to al-'Ayni for advice on legal matters,al-Sakhawi, al-Daw' , 10:134. and named him chief Hanafi qadi (judge) in 829 AH (1426 CE.) He was dismissed from this post after three years; by his own report, both he and the chief Shafi'i qadi, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, were dismissed at the same time because their constant feuding was distracting them from their duties; though he adds that this was a calumny spread by his enemies at court. He was later reappointed.Al-'Ayni, 'Iqd al-JumƒÅn, 372. In the reign of BarsbƒÅy's successor, al-Aziz Jaqmaq, al-'Ayni was dismissed as chief Hanafi qadi again. He withdrew from court and concentrated on his scholarly writing.al-SakhƒÅwi, al-Daw' , 10:133. In 853 AH (1449 CE) he was dismissed as nƒÅzir al-ahbas, probably because of failing memory.Ibn Taghribƒ´rdƒ´, History of Egypt 1382‚Äì1467, trans. Popper, 19:118. He died in 855 AH (1451 CE) at the age of ninety-three, having outlived all his children, and was buried in his own madrasah in Cairo.

He has three games on Computer Gaming World's list of the best games of all time. He has formerly been involved with the management of several games companies, including Quantum Quality Productions, Moto1 where he was vice-president and White Wolf Productions where he was CEO. Mark is currently a Professor of Practice at Colorado School of Mines. His career has been quite varied including Captain in the US Air Force, lead engineer for ascent flight design for the Space Shuttle, award- winning game designer, entrepreneur, consultant, and academic. Early life and education Mark was born to William and Bette Baldwin in Lansing Michigan on January 29, 1952. His father was an officer in the USAF, and therefore he grew up as a military dependent traveling throughout the globe. In the US, he lived in Indiana, Michigan, Alabama, Georgia and Florida. He also grew up in Japan (3 yrs) and Germany (3 yrs). In 1970, Mark attended Purdue University in West Lafayette Indiana obtaining both a BS and MS in Engineering Sciences, graduating in December 1974. Career While at Purdue, Mark received an Air Force ROTC scholarship. Upon completion of his degree, he was commissioned in the Air Force. Initially, he was a combat engineer (Red Horse) but quickly changed over to Missile Flight Officer at SAC headquarters in Omaha Nebraska where he planned and modeled both US and Soviet nuclear war plans. Upon leaving the Air Force in 1979, Mark was employed by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace as a contractor for NASA at Johnson Space Center. Initially, he was responsible for developing abort techniques for the first four flights of the Space Shuttle. He then was promoted to Lead Engineer for ascent flight design for the Space Shuttle, where he was responsible for all flight designs between STS-5 and STS-51L. He left NASA two days before the Challenger Disaster (1986) to do similar work for Martin Marietta in Denver Colorado. One of Mark's early interest and hobbies going back to the 1960s was strategy games. He published a science fiction paper game (Lensman) in his teens that was well received. With the advent of personal computers, Mark started developing computer games evenings while working at NASA. After moving to Denver Colorado, he decided that Martin Marietta was not a company he wanted to work for, so he left Aerospace in 1987 to work full-time on computer games. Mark has authored or was involved with many games, including Starbase 13, Empire, Star Fleet I, Star Fleet II, D.R.A.G.O.N. FORCE, and Star Legions. In 1991, Mark cofounded White Wolf Productions, one of the top computer game design houses in the country. White Wolf's products include the award-winning The Perfect General, Empire Deluxe and most recently Empire II: The Art of War. One innovative work he is quite proud of was the Empire Deluxe Scenarios for which Mark managed to create the first Computer Game Anthology incorporating the work of such notable designers and authors as Jerry Pournelle, James Dunnigan, Don Gilman, Will Wright, Trevor Sorensen and many others. White Wolf closed its doors in December 1995, to allow the principals to move on to different projects. Mark was active with the game industry and the military. During this period, projects included Galaxis and Metal Fatigue in the computer game industry; and Sensor Combat and JWARS for the military. He was Vice President of Production for Quantum Quality Productions and Vice President of Game Development for Moto1, Inc. Mark was also instrumental in establishing early industry organizations. As early as 1988, Mark was an advocate for the forming of the Computer Game Developers Association (CGDA). In addition, he was a founding board member of the International Game Developer's Network (IGDN) which later merged with the CGDA to form the current International Game Developers Association (IGDA). In 2004, Mark was invited to develop a games program at Media Design School in Auckland New Zealand where he spent 6 months teaching. Upon return to the US, he started teaching as an adjunct and visiting professor at a number of schools including University of Advanced Technology, DeVry University, Westwood College (where he was program chair) and Southern New Hampshire University. This led to a teaching position at the prestigious Colorado School of Mines.

It was formed as part of the massive mobilization of August 1941, and first saw action in early December in the counteroffensive west of Moscow. During 1942 and into 1943 it saw limited action on a relatively quiet sector of the front north of Bryansk, before joining a limited offensive in February. During the general offensives of that summer, the division fought in the drive past Smolensk, and made a forced crossing of the upper Dniepr River. The 324th played a limited role in Operation Bagration, but distinguished itself in the fighting in East Prussia in 1945, sufficiently to be awarded the Order of the Red Banner. During the course of the war the men and women of the division served under no fewer than nine commanding officers.  Formation  The division began forming in August 1941, at Cheboksary in the Moscow Military District.Walter S.

Orders were received on December 5 for the counteroffensive to begin the next day.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 2 The 324th began from a line from Slobodka to Pecherniki, and was directed towards Stalinogorsk, facing rearguards of the German 29th and 10th Motorized Divisions and 18th Panzer Division, plus other small infantry units. The division was roughly in the center of the Army's front, which was advancing more slowly than planned. On the morning of December 11 Army commander Lt. Gen. Filipp Golikov issued orders that the leading divisions, including the 324th, reach the line Uzlovaya station - Bogoroditsk - Kuzovka over the next 24 hours. On December 13 the division fought its way into Lyutorichi on the Don River and continued to the west. By the end of December 17 units of the division had crossed the Upa River along the Naumovka - Myasnovka sector. At this point the second stage of the Tula operation by 10th Army was completed. The next stage of the advance began on December 20, towards Belyov and Kozelsk. The 324th was in the Army's second echelon, concentrated in the area Lyapishchevo - Polozovo - Rzhavo. From December 21 - 24 the Army overcame the resistance of small enemy rearguards. By the end of this period the 324th had reached the area of Krasnokole - Sonino - Kostino. there were almost no enemy units in front of the division because 1st Guards Cavalry Corps was operating ahead of it. By late of December 26 it had reached Kudrino - Snykhovo; in 20 days it had advanced a distance of about 200km.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4 During the latter half of December 28 the 324th and the 239th Rifle Division made a fighting advance to the line Kudrino - Davydovo, and by the next day had reached the Kozelsk area, where they linked up with 1st Guards Cavalry. From January 1 - 5, 1942, the two rifle divisions fought to liberate Sukhinichi, but were unsuccessful.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 5 Following this 10th Army command decided to blockade the city with the 324th, two companies of the 239th, and a battalion of the 323rd Rifle Division. During the day on January 8 units of the division went over to the attack on one sector in the Sukhinichi area, and took several buildings in the southern and southwestern outskirts, but were then stopped by heavy enemy fire from fortified stone houses. German Army Group Center began to receive reinforcements from occupied France which allowed them to launch a counterattack to relieve its besieged troops on January 18. Part of the Sukhinichi garrison was extracted by the German relief force and the town was finally liberated on January 29. Fighting by both sides persisted into February with mixed success.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 8  Into Western Russia and Belarus  At the end of January 1942, 324th was reassigned to 16th Army, still in Western Front. After the winter fighting ended, this sector, north of Bryansk, remained relatively inactive for the balance of the year. On March 9, General Kiryukin handed over his command to Major Ivan Yakovlevich Kravchenko; Kiryukhin would go on to command the 24th Rifle Corps and become a Hero of the Soviet Union.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1808 [Russian; English translation available] Major Kravchenko had been named a Hero of the Soviet Union in 1940 for his actions during the Winter War with Finland.

Gen. Mikhail Yemilyanovich Yerokhin on August 29. Following the Soviet victory at Stalingrad in early 1943, the STAVKA made every effort to make the local success more general, and 16th Army was ordered to attack the German defenses north of Zhizdra on February 22, 1943, in conjunction with other attacks by 61st and 3rd Armies, attempting to capture the salient around Oryol held by 2nd Panzer Army. The 324th, on the far left, was one of six rifle divisions of its Army that made up a shock group backed by three tank brigades, with 9th Tank Corps in reserve. In the event, rain, mud-clogged roads and skillful German resistance brought the advance to a halt after gains of 7km at most, and the tank corps was never committed.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Inc., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 291-95 In April, 16th Army became the 11th Guards Army, and the 324th was moved to 50th Army on April 19, where it would remain for the duration; this army was also in Western Front. On April 27, General Yerokhin handed his command over to Col. Ernest Zhanovich Sedulin; Yerokhin would go on to command 81st Rifle Corps before returning to the division. In August, 50th Army was transferred to Bryansk Front, and when that Front was dissolved in October, joined Central Front, which was soon renamed Belorussian Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 76Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 248, 277 On November 25, Colonel Sedulin was replaced in command by Lt. Col. A. M. Osadchii and on the same day 50th Army launched an offensive from its positions along the Pronya River just north of Propoysk which penetrated the German front as much as 30km over the next 15 days, finally approaching the Dniepr River near Novyi Bykhov. The 324th was in the first echelon when the Army went over to the defense.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 202-03 Colonel Osadchii had handed the division over to Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Bondovsky in the midst of this operation on December 2. On January 4, 1944, 3rd Army, to the south of the 50th, launched a new offensive in the direction of Bykhov; for this effort the 324th was attached to that Army's 80th Rifle Corps. A daring night raid by ski troops had disrupted the headquarters of the defending German 267th Infantry Division, and 80th Corps quickly penetrated to a depth of 5km before reaching the German Winter Defense Line along the Ukhliast River. The next day the division reverted to 50th Army control, but despite the help of the 110th and 413th Rifle Divisions was unable to crack this new line.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 408-15 Belorussian Front became 1st Belorussian Front in February, and the 324th was assigned to 121st Rifle Corps. In the last week of that month the division took part in the Rogachev - Zhlobin Offensive:Beginning on March 25 the division and its Corps took part in an offensive, along with forces of 10th Army, to reduce or eliminate the bridgehead east of the Dniepr still held by German 4th Army, but this effort made only limited gains and was halted on March 31. On the night of April 5 the 324th took over the positions held by the 82nd Rifle Division on the southern outskirts of Krasnitsa.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 528-34 50th Army remained in this Front until April, when it was transferred to 2nd Belorussian Front. On April 22 Col. Ivan Kornilovich Kazak was appointed to command, which he would hold until October. As of May 1 the division was reassigned to 19th Rifle Corps, where it served in the opening stages of Operation Bagration.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 131 The 50th was holding a wide sector, but also had orders to assist the much stronger 49th Army in its assaults on the German-held city of Mogilev. On the morning of June 24, 19th Rifle Corps penetrated the German 267th Infantry Division's line at Ludchitsa, but this attack was contained by 1100 hrs. On June 28 the 324th helped to force a crossing of the Dniepr near the city of Shklov and soon received the battle honor \\"Upper Dniepr\\" for this accomplishment:After the liberation of Mogilev, on July 1, 19th Rifle Corps crossed the Berezina River north of Brodets; following this, 50th Army cut off the escape of the broken German 4th Army between Berezino and Chervin, and then headed for Minsk.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2000, pp. 164, 168, 176 On July 9 the division became a separate division under Army command. It was tasked, along with 38th Rifle Corps and five other separate rifle divisions, plus three NKVD border regiments, to methodically comb through the forested areas east of Minsk with light air support. This was a search and destroy mission against enemy groups that had not yet surrendered. During this operation, which ended on July 13, the 324th eliminated a group of about 2,000 men in the Bolshoi Trostenets - Yelnitsa - Apchak area led by General Engel, the commander of the 45th Infantry Division.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans.

JDP or Jugodrp) is a theatre located in Belgrade, Serbia. It was founded in 1947 as the representative theater of new Yugoslavia. Actors from Zagreb, Novi Sad, Sarajevo, Split, Ljubljana and other cities were invited to perform there.  History  In 1947, director Bojan Stupica was appointed the head of the theatre as an artistic manager, much to the dismay of his mother, along with the critic Elli Fincci. Fincci laid the foundation for the reporter orientation of the Yugoslav Drama Theatre as the theatre that focused on high literary quality. Approximately 60 renowned actors were selected as initial members, of which –úarija Crnobori, –úira Stupica, Branka Veselinoviƒá, –úlaƒëa Veselinoviƒá and Kapitalina Eriƒá are still alive.Theatre got its name after the famous actress, retrieved on October 10, 2010 The Yugoslav Drama Theatre was founded on the site of the driving school, and the stable was adapted and turned into the stage. The first performance, \\"The King of Betajnova\\" by Ivan Cankar and directed by Bojan Stupica, was performed on 3 April 1948. This date is celebrated as the Yugoslav Drama Theatre Day, and on that date the annual awards are given. The first two seasons were marked by presentations of world and domestic classic dramas: Chekhov, Goldoni, Sheridan, Ostrovsky, Lope de Vega, Gorky, Shaw, Shakespeare, Plaut, Raisin, Moli√®re, Ibsen, Lorca, and the Domestic classics Cankar, Dr≈æiƒá, Sterija Popoviƒá, –à–∞k≈°iƒá and Nu≈°iƒá. The early directors who contributed to the reputation of the Yugoslav Drama Theatre (Bojan Stupica, –úata –úilo≈°eviƒá and –¢–æmislav –¢–∞nhofer) were influenced by European modernism as explored between the two world wars, which was evident in their selection of plays. From the mid-eighties, theatrologist –à–ævan ƒÜirilov, during fourteen seasons as the manager, upgraded the Yugoslav Drama Theatre to the representative theatre of modern stage expression far beyond the boundaries of the former soviet state. The Yugoslav Drama Theatre was destroyed by fire on 17 October 1997, allegedly due to an installation malfunction. The theatre was rebuilt, and the Great Stage was opened again on 23 May 2003 with an opening night featuring the play \\"The Patriots\\" by –à–ævan Sterija Popoviƒá, directed by Dejan Mijaƒç. Branko Cvejiƒá, an actor, was the assistant director, and since 12 July 2002 he has been the director of the theatre. Another director Gorƒçin Stojanoviƒá has been the manager since 2001, and an artistic director since 12 July 2002. The Great Stage now bears the name of the great figure of the Serbian acting stage, Ljuba Tadiƒá. Since 2003 to the present, the renewed Yugoslav Drama Theatre has performed the plays by Chekhov, Shakespeare, Bulgakov, Wedekind, –êndrejev, √ñd√∂n von Horv√°th, Ostrovsky, LaBute, Hristiƒá, Dukovski, Srbljanoviƒá, and –ú–∞rkoviƒá.The Yugoslav Drama Theatre Studio was the third addition to the theatre, it serves as an experimental stage for young authors and actors.

It was a simple, two-story building, with elongated basis, which, a couple of decades later, was to become the home of the ensemble of the National Theatre, because the main building was damaged during the First World War. The old stable, popularly known as \\"Wooden manege\\" for a very short time served to the theatre admirers. In 1927, the building burned to the ground. The construction of the new building began that same year. After the plan designed by the prominent Russian architect, Nikolai Petrovich Krasnov, the new building was financed by the shareholders' funds. Academically conceived, the main facade was enlivened by the series of decorative architectural elements and allegoric sculptures, by the author Vojislav Ratimiroviƒá ≈†ikoparija, a Belgrade sculptor.Moderna arhitektura Beograda u osvit Drugog svetskog rata: sajam, stadion, logor\\" u Istorija umetnosti u Srbiji XX vek, tom 2.

From 1929 until 1931, it served as the theatre building (\\"The building on Vraƒçar\\") when the interior of the building was altered due to the temporary moving in of the National Assembly.  After the Second World War  In 1947, the eminent architect –ú–æmƒçilo N. Belobrkhttp://www.vreme.co.rs/cms/view.php?id=341722, retrieved on 30 March 2016 created the design for the readaptation of the building for theatre performances. The building of the Yugoslav drama Theatre, as it was then officially named, was a brave modernist and monumental work. It remained typical for its long facade without ornamentation. An architect, –ú–æmƒçilo Belobrk, put the special accent on the –∞trium, at the centre of which was a small decorative pool with a bronze sculpture, by sculptor Boris Kalin. Belobrk did not only modernize the theatre, which included a new type of stage, lighting, acoustics, grandstand, but he particularly insisted on detailed design of the entire theatre inventory, starting from the tickets. The new time brought new changes. The team of two authors, an architect, ƒêorƒëe Bobiƒá, and an academic painter, ƒåedomir Vasiƒá, came up with the new concept of the appearance of the building, which included the combination of the old and the new. Based on the announced competition in 1997, which included the reconstruction, modernization and detailed reparation of the building, the works started after the best design of a young architect Zoran Radojƒçiƒá and friends (as the author called his associates). The object was evaluated as \\"the sensible modernistic intervention\\" and is nowadays the venue of the rich theatre life in the centre of the capital.  The New building  In 1997, architect Zoran Radojiƒçiƒá won a competition for the reconstruction of Yugoslav Drama Theatre in Belgrade.

Formed by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas, it united for a time Protestant and Catholic tenants, Duffy calling his movement The League of North and South.Hickey, D.J. & Doherty , J.E., A new Dictionary of Irish History from 1800, pp. 466-7 (2003), Gill & MacMillan (2003) The political background to the movement was the post-famine Encumbered Estates Act 1849, and the resultant change in land ownership at landlord level. In the north of Ireland, Protestant and Presbyterian ministers feared that the new landlords would destroy the \\"Ulster custom\\" of tenancy, which compensated tenants for any improvement undertaken. Concurrently, in the south of Ireland politically minded young Catholic priests were agitating for the adoption there of the Ulster custom as a measure of reform. The League was founded in Dublin at a meeting attended by representatives of the Tenant Protection Societies, 9 August 1850. Its support came initially from the Ulster Tenant Right Association led by William Sharman Crawford. As a constitutional movement, the league sought to secure the adoption and enforcement of the Three Fs, namely: ::*fair rent; ::*fixity of tenure; ::*free sale. (These would all have aided Irish tenant farms, all of whom lacked them.) For the larger tenant farmers fixity of tenure was the priority; on the other hand the league never had the support of smaller tenants, their prime concern was fair rents. The founders strove to establish a parliamentary party of Irish members who would oppose any government not prepared to grant \\"Tenant-Right\\" also known as the Ulster Custom. The Tenant Right League met with considerable success under its national organiser, John Martin. It had the support of the surviving Repealers in the British House of Commons; and of a number of English Radicals. It was agreed, all around, that a Land Act embodying the three F's would be a real gain. In the 1852 general election, some fifty Tenant Right candidates, including Gavan Duffy, Lucas and John Sadleir, were returned to parliament, where they sat as the Independent Irish Party. Its manifesto read: Despite efforts of William Sharman Crawford, the Reverend David Bell and other Protestant tenant-right activists in the north, none of the MPs elected represented Ulster counties. In the Monaghan election Bell's appeal for unity could not prevail against calls of the Union in danger, and \\"No Popery\\". The League candidate, Dr. John Gray, was a Protestant but editor of the pro-Repeal, largely Catholic, Freeman's Journal. Of the one hundred Presbyterians who a signed the requisition asking Gray to stand, Bell found only eleven had the courage to vote for him. Elsewhere the League's success was short lived and was ultimately destroyed and weakened when a number of prominent members broke away and established the Catholic Defence Association (the Pope's Brass Band). Supporters of the league were also intimidated by hostile landlords. The most serious blows to its success came when Lucas decided to take his complaint about the Archbishop of Dublin Paul Cullen to Rome, which alienated clerical support. Lucas died in October 1855 shortly after the failure of his mission, a month later Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia. The League finally petered out in 1859, and the Independent Irish Party had disappeared by 1860. In 1870 Gladstone passed the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870, that was well-intentioned, but ineffectual from the onset of the \\"Long Depression\\" of agricultural prices. The demand for tenants rights was however continued by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath and taken up again as a popular cause by the Land League in 1879, when the \\"Three Fs\\" were anchored in the Land Law (Ireland) Act (1881), previously pursued rigorously by Michael Davitt.

It is one of two hospitals run by The Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. History Mount Vernon House, the former hospital in Hampstead The hospital was founded as The North London Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest in a mansion in Hampstead High Street in 1860. A central London out-patients department opened in the Tottenham Court Road in 1861. In October 1880 Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn laid the foundation stone for a purpose-built hospital at Mount Vernon in Hampstead. The hospital, which was built in the French Renaissance style, was completed in 1881. The adjacent Mount Vernon House served as the residence of the Hospital Seceretary and from 1903 as the hospital's Nurses' Home. Meanwhile the Central London out-patients department moved from Tottenham Court Road to Fitzroy Square in 1891. In 1901 it was decided to build a more-modern facility on part of the Northwood Park Estate in Northwood, London. The foundation stone was laid by Princess Helena the following year. The hospital, which was designed by Frederick Wheeler, was arranged as a sanatorium with the wards following a semi-circle shape either side of a central staircase.Bowlt 2007, p.72 The new Mount Vernon Hospital opened in September 1904 and the old Hampstead building was then acquired and occupied by the Medical Research Council's National Institute for Medical Research. During the First World War, soldiers were treated at the Mount Vernon Hospital and, in 1932, the Central London out-patients department moved to Riding House Street. At the outbreak of the Second World War Mount Vernon became a general hospital dealing with, inter alia, war casualties. In 1947 the central London out patients department moved to Portland Place and, in 1948, the hospital joined the National Health Service. The Cancer Centre at Mount Vernon, opened in 2009 In 1957, the Gray Laboratory was established and, in 1967, the Marie Curie Hospital, which had been providing cancer treatment from premises in Fitzjohn's Avenue, also moved to Mount Vernon site. The Paul Strickland Scanner Centre, which provides specialist imaging facilities using high quality equipment, opened in 1985 and was officially opened by the Duchess of Kent on 20 March 1986. The old hospital chapel which includes art nouveau designs, was converted into a library for the Gray Cancer Institute in 1988. The Lynda Jackson Macmillan Centre for cancer support and information was opened in 1993 by The Prince of Wales. In 2009 a new treatment centre opened, providing surgery facilities in four new operating theatres. There is also a new outpatients department located in the treatment centre. Performance In 2014 the Care Quality Commission found Mount Vernon Hospital was good at caring and being effective but safety, responsiveness and leadership all required improvement.Mount Vernon Hospital Mount Vernon Cancer Centre The cancer centre is run by East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust. In October 2019 a group of experts reported to health leaders that, due to dilapidated buildings, obsolete equipment and a lack of staff, patients were unsafe and the quality of care was uncertain. It is planned to be taken over by University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in April 2021. Transport The nearest tube station to the hospital is at Northwood, which is served by the Metropolitan line. Five buses serve Mount Vernon Hospital, three of which are London bus routes. These routes are: * 8 (towards Woodside, via South Oxhey and Watford) * 282 (TfL, towards Ealing Hospital) * 331 (TfL, towards Ruislip and Uxbridge) * H11 (TfL, towards Harrow) * R21 (towards Uxbridge twice per day, otherwise terminating at Maple Cross)  See also  * Healthcare in London * List of hospitals in England References Bibliography * Bowlt, Eileen.

From 1996 to 1998, he served as Union Home Minister in the United Front governments of prime ministers H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral. That was a dramatic reversal of roles, as the home ministry had, since independence in 1947, banned the CPI thrice, with many of its members, including Gupta, being sent to prison or pushed underground for long stretches. He was the longest-serving member having been elected eleven times to the Lok Sabha the lower house of Indian Parliament.He suffered his only electoral reverse when he lost to Ashok Krishna Dutt in 1977 after the CPI supported Emergency. Early life Gupta belonged to a Brahmo family of Calcutta. His paternal grandfather, Behari Lal Gupta, ICS, was the Dewan of Baroda and his elder brother, Ranajit Gupta, ICS, was Chief Secretary of West Bengal. His father, Satish Chandra Gupta (c. 1877‚Äì7 September 1964), who belonged to the IA&AS; was an Accountant General of India and retired as Secretary of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1933. After his schooling at Simla, where his father was posted, Gupta studied at St. Stephen's College, Delhi and later went to King's College, Cambridge. While studying in England he came under the influence of Rajani Palme Dutt and joined the communist movement.Bose, Anjali, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary), Appendix of Vol II, 2005, p. 9, , Sansad With a Tripos from the University of Cambridge he returned to Calcutta in 1938 to join the peasants' and workers' movement. He not only had to go to jail for his communist activities but was also sentenced to 'party jail' in 1948 for adopting a soft stand within the party. He went underground in India during 1948‚Äì50 when there was a crackdown on Communists. Parliamentarian Gupta was elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament of India, for the first time in 1960, in a by-election. Thereafter, except for a short period from 1977 to 1980, he was a member till his death. In later years, as a result of his being the oldest member of the Lok Sabha he served as pro tem Speaker in 1996, 1998 and 1999. The office of pro tem Speaker is a ceremonial one mainly to conduct the swearing in of the newly elected members. He was a member of the second and third Lok Sabha from 1962 to 1967 representing Calcutta South-West; fourth and fifth Lok Sabha from 1967 to 1977 representing Alipore; seventh and eighth Lok Sabha from 1980 to 1989 representing Basirhat; and ninth to thirteenth Lok Sabha from 1989 till his death representing Midnapore parliamentary constituencies of West Bengal. Gupta served on a number of parliamentary committees with distinction. He was chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on defence during 1995‚Äì1996 and was chairman of the committee on subordinate legislation from 1999 till his death. He was a member of the rules committee during 1990‚Äì1991, general purposes committee during 1985‚Äì1989 and from 1998 onwards; committee on defence from 1998‚Äì2000, committee on petitions during 1986‚Äì1987, business advisory committee from 1986‚Äì1987 and in 1989, library committee during 1990‚Äì1991 and the committee to review Lok Sabha Secretariat rules in 1990. As an opposition stalwart and leader of the CPI group, Gupta's speeches in the Lok Sabha were marked by 'force with moderation, criticism with reason', and earned him the admiration of even his political opponents. Though not enamoured of office, Gupta accepted the cabinet berth in the United Front Government during 1996‚Äì98. As Home Minister, Gupta was still blunt about government's failures and raised many an eyebrow among the treasury benches with his frank observations. When he was the Home Minister and the BJP the main opposition party, his favourite phrase on meeting the more vocal opposition members after a stormy day was: \\"If I were in the Opposition I'd have done what you did.\\" Gupta was conferred with the ‚ÄòOutstanding Parliamentarian‚Äô Award in 1992. He served the Lok Sabha for 37 years, and when he died President K.R. Narayanan paid a tribute, using three characteristics in his condolence message that suitably describes the man: \\"Gandhian simplicity, democratic outlook and deep commitment to values.\\" Partyman On return to India in 1938, he wrote to the Communist Party, offering his services \\"in any suitable capacity\\". During the underground phase of the party, Gupta worked under the alias Surya, given to him by the party's 'technical cell'. In 1964, when the party split, Gupta was among the 35 members of the National Council who swore by the parent organisation led by S.A. Dange. Always skeptical about the Congress Party, he formally opposed the idea of his party joining the United Front cabinet in 1996 with its support, but caved in as the majority demanded it. Rising from the grassroots level in the Communist Party of India. Gupta was made General Secretary of CPI in 1990 at the age of 71. He held the office for six years till 1996. An active trade unionist, Gupta had earlier been General Secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress during 1980‚Äì90. He was also Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions and elected its President in 1998. He was a stickler for decency. On entering politics he accepted the official code of conduct of the Communist Party from which he never deviated. He lived in a two-room quarter at the Western Court, and walked to the Lok Sabha until he became a minister. Subsequently, also he led a simple life and shunned many of the facilities he was entitled to. When he was minister, he never allowed the official car to enter the airport tarmac for him after a flight. Instead he used the airline bus to reach the terminal. Personal life He married, at the age of 62, Suraiya, the woman he had loved for many years. He waited till her earlier marriage with photographer Ahmed Ali (father of social activist Nafisa Ali) was lawfully dissolved. Works Capital and Labour in the Jute Industry and Self Reliance in National Defence Opinions On Left politics ‚ÄúThe Left as it is at present is certainly not going to come to power. There is not even a ghost of a chance of that. We will continue to be a part of the Opposition. If you want to achieve the objective that you have declared, then you should try to adopt tactics that would avoid or minimise the division of anti-BJP votes to the extent possible. This strategy should be adopted in all states other than in those states where the BJP is still not a major factor at all, where we would continue to have our main conflict with the Congress.\\" On caste-ridden politics ‚ÄúA caste-ridden society and a bitter caste war is a very big inhibiting factor that has held the Left back. From the beginning, we never bothered about the caste factor. In the old days the Communists never bothered about this. We were all class-wallahs. Exploitation of one class by another class is okay. But exploitation of one caste by another caste was never a big factor in our minds. But in a Hindu society, I find this [the caste system] is the dominant thing ‚Äì much more than class. We have a working class in the big industrial centres where we [the Communists] were the dominant force among the workers, particularly at the trade union level. Big strikes were taking place. We were leading those strikes. But when it came to elections, the same worker who was carrying a red flag on his shoulders to get a higher salary or a bonus, would look towards his own caste. ‚ÄúI don't think the Communists, the Marxists, in this country paid sufficient attention or made a proper study of this phenomenon. It is not a phenomenon which started one day. It has been there for one thousand years. And every educated fellow, the elite of our society, goes around saying that we are above caste. This is telling lies. Read the matrimonial columns in the papers. Yes, they don't indulge in crude forms of casteism ‚Äì not allowing someone to drink out of the same glass ‚Äì but will they allow a Dalit to come and sit at their table and eat with them? I doubt it very much. Of course, marriage is out of the question. This thing is so deeply rooted in our psyche, this Manusmriti, this Chaturvarna [four basic castes], to get out of it will take a thousand years.\\"  Notes  References External links * Official biographical sketch in Parliament of India website Category:1919 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Bengali politicians Category:Alumni of King's College, Cambridge Category:Communist Party of India politicians from West Bengal Category:2nd Lok Sabha members Category:3rd Lok Sabha members Category:4th Lok Sabha members Category:5th Lok Sabha members Category:7th Lok Sabha members Category:8th Lok Sabha members Category:9th Lok Sabha members Category:10th Lok Sabha members Category:11th Lok Sabha members Category:12th Lok Sabha members Category:13th Lok Sabha members Category:Indian accountants Category:Indian atheists Category:Lok Sabha members from West Bengal Category:People from Alipore Category:Ministers of Internal Affairs of India Category:Pro tem Speakers of the Lok Sabha Category:People from North 24 Parganas district Category:People from South 24 Parganas district Category:People from Kolkata district Category:People from Paschim Medinipur district ","title":"Indrajit Gupta"},{"id":"7140557","text":"Se√°n 'ac Dhonncha (alternatively, Se√°n 'ac onna, Johnny Joe Pheaits√≠n, 1919‚Äì1996) was a traditional Irish singer.

The pitch of the fan blades is controlled by the audio signal presented to the voice coil, and is able to swing both positive and negative, with respect to a zero pitch spinning blade position. Since the audio amplifier only changes the pitch of the blades, it takes much less power, per dB of generated acoustic sound level, to drive a rotary woofer than to power a conventional subwoofer, which uses a moving electromagnet (voice coil) placed within the field of a stationary permanent magnet to drive a cone which then displaces air. Rotary woofers excel at producing sounds below 20 Hz, below the normal hearing range; when installed in the wall of a sealed room, they can produce audio frequencies down to zero Hz, a static pressure differential, by simply compressing the air in the sealed room. Description In the early 1970s, researchers noted that while humans could detect frequencies below 20 Hz, the ear was much less sensitive to these frequencies. As a result, increased sound pressure levels are required to perceive these sounds. These frequencies are often not audible but still subliminally detected by humans (see: Infrasound). Typical subwoofers using moving cones do not transmit energy very well to the air below 20 Hz, and thus their sound pressure level (SPL) falls off significantly below this frequency. To help people to perceive the very-low- frequency content available in recorded material, Bruce Thigpen of Eminent Technology experimented with new methods of producing the required SPL. The rotary woofer displaces far more air than is possible using moving cones, which makes very-low-frequency reproduction possible. Instead of using a moving electromagnet (voice coil) placed within the field of a stationary permanent magnet to drive a cone, like a conventional subwoofer, on a rotary woofer, the voice coil's motion is used to change the angle of a fixed rotation speed set of fan blades in order to generate sound pressure waves. The pitch of the blades change according to the signal the amplifier supplies, producing a modulated sound wave due to the air moved by the spinning blades. If there is no signal applied, the blades simply rotate \\"flat\\" at zero pitch, producing no sound. Since the audio amplifier only changes the pitch of the blades, it takes much less power to drive a rotary woofer, although a secondary power source is required to drive the fan motor.B. J. Bedard and T. M. Georges, \\"Atmospheric infrasound,\\" Phys. Today 53(3), 32‚Äì37 (2000). As an analogy, the hub of the rotary woofer's fan is somewhat like a helicopter's swashplate which allows a stationary source of reciprocating motion‚Äîthe voice coil of the subwoofer‚Äîto change the angle of the spinning set of blades. A rotary woofer is designed to produce only frequencies lower than 20 Hz; distortion increases as the input frequency exceeds the fan's rotation rate (20 Hz would be about 1200 rpm for the fan), which is itself limited by the need to avoid making higher-frequency noise (due to the sound of the spinning blades). Current models use an AC induction motor spinning at 800 RPM (13 Hz). The woofer is installed and carefully braced so that the blades lie in a circular opening, so that air can be moved between an external chamber, such as the attic of a house, and the main listening space; if the rotary woofer were not installed in such a \\"baffle\\" and placed directly in the main space instead, the generated sound pressure from the rear of the unit being 180 degrees out of phase would almost completely cancel that from the front the end, the result of which would not be fit for its intended application. This suggests that for sound to be perceived at 7‚Äì8 Hz, the 7‚Äì8 Hz SPL would have to be 12.3 dB higher than the 92.0 dB SPL required at 15.5 Hz, which means that the 7‚Äì8 Hz SPL would require at least 104 dB of SPL to be perceived. For 3 Hz to be perceived, the SPL would need to add another 12.3 dB, or reach 116 dB of SPL, to be perceived. Installations Six rotary woofers are installed as part of an immersive Niagara Falls attraction known as Niagara's Fury, located in the Table Rock House, to provide low frequency extension down to less than 1 Hertz, to emulate those waves created by the falls.

It can also be made from other milks, but that is less common. It is a stretched-curd cheese, in which the fresh curd matures in its own whey for several hours to allow acidity to develop by the process of lactose being converted to lactic acid. Artisanal cheese makers generally form the cheese into a round shape, and then tie a string around the mass one third of the distance from the top, and hang to dry. The resulting shape is pear-like. This is sometimes referred to as \\"strangling\\" the cheese. The cheese is usually white in color unless smoked. When smoked, the color is almond with a lighter interior. Scamorza can be substituted for mozzarella in most dishes, but the resulting taste will be much stronger and more dominant. It is reputed to melt better in baking. Using the smoked variety (scamorza affumicata) adds a nice background flavor in replacement of mozzarella. Etymology The term may come from the Italian phrases capa mozza or testa mozzata, both meaning \\"severed head\\". This would also explain the use of \\"scamorza\\" in regional Italian to mean \\"fool\\" or \\"idiot\\". Production areas In Italy, scamorza is more commonly made in the south rather than the north. Strictly speaking, scamorza is a product of Apulia and Calabria.(Slow Food Editore. 2005. Italian cheese, p. 372.) However, it is available across the country, both in the unsmoked and smoked forms. Mario Batali cites grilled scamorza as a traditional dish in Neapolitan cooking.(Batali, M. 2008. Italian grill, p.33.) Scamorza in Bari is made from sheep's milk. This is not necessarily true of cheeses called scamorza outside the EU.

A Democrat, he is a former member of the Utah State Senate, where he represented the state's 2nd senate district which comprises portions of Salt Lake City (map). He resigned from the senate in December 2009 to dedicate himself more fully to his legal career.Scott McCoy to resign from Utah Senate Early life and career He was educated at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri (B.A., 1992), George Washington University in Washington, D.C. (M.A., 1994) and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City (J.D., 2001). From January 2002 to March 2003, he served as law clerk to Justice Leonard H. Russon of the Utah Supreme Court. Scott was an associate at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton from January 2001 to December 2001 before moving to Utah to clerk for Justice Russon. After finishing his clerkship he became a member of the Utah Bar and began practicing law at Bendinger, Crockett, Petersen, Greenwood and Casey, where he practiced commercial law with a focus on business litigation, antitrust, and federal securities. Scott was also active in the LGBT rights movement in Utah. He served as a member of the board of Equality Utah. Scott also served as a member of and as chair of the Salt Lake City Police Civilian Review Board. After leaving Utah in 2011, Scott returned to New York City to practice law at Cleary Gottlieb again from 2011 to 2014. Senate career McCoy was appointed to the seat by Utah Democratic Party delegates in February 2005, following the resignation of Senator Paula Julander on health grounds. He beat Julander's husband ‚Äì longtime party leader Rod Julander ‚Äì by 44 votes to 41 in the final selection vote.\\"Scott McCoy Elected to Replace State Sen. Paula Julander\\" on slmetro.com His appointment was then formalized by Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr.. He ran for re-election in 2006 and faced little opposition in this reliably Democratic district, defeating his Republican opponent by more than two-to- one. McCoy, who lives with his husband Mark Barr, was Utah's first-ever openly gay state senator. He and Barr moved to New York City in June 2011, where they got married on July 24, 2011, the first day that same-sex marriages were legal in New York. In 2004, he led the Don't Amend Alliance, the statewide campaign against a proposed amendment to Utah's state constitution regarding eligibility for marriage. His re-election campaign won the support of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund. McCoy was one of four Democratic legislative sponsors of the 2009 Common Ground Initiative, the most expansive legislative push for gay rights in state history. The drive, crafted in response to statements by the Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has indicated that it does not oppose some rights for same-sex couples, includes creating a statewide domestic-partner registry and protecting someone from being fired or evicted for being gay. McCoy's Common Ground bill would have amended state law so that financial dependents ‚Äì besides spouses, parents and children ‚Äì could sue if a breadwinner suffers a wrongful death. The measure would have benefited same-sex couples, but also other nontraditional households, such as one in which a grandmother relies on a grandson for financial support. It died early in the 2009 Legislature when it was voted down by the Senate judiciary committee, led by Republican Sen.

He played for four years at UCLA (from 1975 to 1979) and was the 14th player taken in the first round of the 1979 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. He served as a member of the 1980 NBA L.A. Lakers championship team. He was the University of San Diego head basketball coach until March 2007. On April 25, 2007, he was named as one of three finalists to become the new head coach of UC Riverside's men's basketball program, but lost out to Jim Wooldridge. Holland served as an assistant coach at UC Santa Barbara during the 2008‚Äì2009 and 2009‚Äì2010 seasons. Career College and professional basketball Born in Billings, Montana, Holland was a basketball and football star at Crescenta Valley High School. Furthermore, he was a four- year letterman at UCLA. He was the last player recruited by coach John Wooden, becoming part of Pac-10 championships at UCLA from 1976‚Äì1979, two under coach Gene Bartow and two under coach Gary Cunningham. In 1979 he averaged 17.5 points and 4.8 assists and had a .598 goal percentage, the best ever for a Bruin guard. He graduated in 1979 from UCLA with a B.A. degree in Sociology. As a rookie guard with the L.A. Lakers in 1979, Holland scored eight points in a decisive playoff sixth game at Philadelphia. He finished his playing career in 1981‚Äì82 with the Washington Bullets and the Milwaukee Bucks, before retiring with a knee injury. Next, he entered private business and worked as a broadcaster at Prime Ticket from 1985‚Äì1998. Cal State Fullerton In his first year at Cal State Fullerton Holland received rave reviews for turning around the CSUF basketball program. During the 1992‚Äì93 season, Holland's team finished 15-12, posting the school's first winning record since 1985 and going 10-8 in the Big West Conference. Holland's 1993‚Äì94 team lost three players to season-ending injuries prior to the first game. They finished 8-19 overall, and 8th-place in the Big West. He left his post suddenly in September 1994, just two months before the start of the 1994‚Äì95 season. Several years after his departure from Fullerton, it surfaced that Holland was responsible for several NCAA violations, which resulted in the program being placed on probation for 4 years. University of San Diego Holland compiled a record of 200-176 in thirteen years as San Diego head coach. In only two years did San Diego finish with a record of below .500. Holland led the Toreros to the West Coast Conference championship in 2003, beating Gonzaga in the conference tournament on San Diego's home court. He was fired at the completion of the 2006‚Äì2007 season to be replaced by Gonzaga University assistant coach Bill Grier. Coaching success As a coach, Holland achieved WCC coach of the year for the 1998‚Äì99 season, while directing USD to an 18-9 record and second-place finish in the West Coast Conference race (9-5). Highlights for that team include an important win over Texas in the Torero Tip-off, and the team's upset over then No. 25-ranked Gonzaga 75-59. In 1999‚Äì2000 , Holland earned the Toreros 20 wins and 10 WCC victories, the school's most since the 1987 season. The efforts earned Holland the WCC Coach of the Year by his peers for the second season in a row. The Toreros had won seven of their final ten games to finish strong again, a hallmark of Holland coached teams. The season was marked by WCC wins at Gonzaga (82-70) and at home over WCC champion Pepperdine (73-62). The Toreros ended at 10-2 at home, and were 9-7 on the road, including an excellent 5-2 WCC road mark. CollegeInsider.com named Holland as the 2004‚Äì05 West Coast Conference Coach of the Year. Seniors Brandon Gay and Brice Vounang were both named to the NABC District 15 Second Team. Latest coaching seasons 2002‚Äì03 In 2002‚Äì03, Holland managed to guide USD to an impressive 18-12 record, the 2003 West Coast Conference Basketball Championship title and its first trip to the NCAA tournament in sixteen years. As a 13 seed in the South region, San Diego lost in the first round to Stanford, 77-69.2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament 2005‚Äì06 The 2005‚Äì06 season was Holland's 12th season at the helm of the USD's basketball program. He guided them to 108 victories over the past seven seasons including a personal-best 20 win season in 1999‚Äì2000. In the 2004‚Äì2005 season he directed the Toreros to a 16-13 mark, which finished them at 3rd in the West Coast Conference. It tallied its biggest turnaround in Division I Basketball for the wins with an addition of twelve victories. With the team's 69-61 home win over San Francisco on February 9, Holland became the program's all-winningest coach. Holland's USD career mark before the Saturday's game in 2005 was 163-149. This included two years at CS Fullerton, which makes his overall coaching record 186-180. Holland's Firing Holland was subsequently fired at the end of the 2006‚Äì2007 season to be replaced by Gonzaga University's assistant coach, Bill Grier. This was a fairly controversial move by the Toreros because supporters pointed to the fact that Holland was the winningest coach in Toreros history and joined Jim Brovelli and Hank Egan in leading USD to the NCAA Tournament. He also was very supportive of the school's strict academic requirements and nearly every player he coached went on to graduate. A lack of recent success was cited as the major reason for Holland's firing. Since the Toreros' trip to the 2003 NCAA Tournament, Holland's teams achieved little success beyond the occasional victory over cross-town rivals San Diego State University Aztecs, and wins in the West Coast Conference tournament. Because of this, student and city apathy in the program was growing and USD Athletic Director Ky Snyder believed it was best to refresh the program with Bill Grier, a coach from a successful rival program, Gonzaga University.

Don revolts and formation of the Volunteer Army In the aftermath of the October Revolution, politicians and army officers hostile to the Bolsheviks gravitated to the Don Cossack Host after its ataman, General Aleksey Kaledin, publicly offered sanctuary to opponents of the Soviet regime.Kenez, Peter, Civil War in South Russia, 1918: The First Year of the Volunteer Army (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971) 59. Among those seeking refuge in the Don was the former chief of staff of the tsarist army, General Mikhail Alekseyev, who immediately began organizing a military unit to oppose both the Bolsheviks and the Central Powers. Alekseyev was soon joined by other prominent tsarist generals, including the charismatic Lavr Kornilov. The two men, along with Kaledin, assumed top roles in the anticommunist White movement taking shape in the Don region during the winter of 1917 ‚Äì 18. Militarily, the White forces remained weak into the spring of 1918. The ranks of the Volunteer Army formed by Alekseyev and Kornilov never exceeded over 4,000 combatants during its first months.Kenez, 68 On paper, Kaledin held nominal command over tens of thousands of Don Cossacks but most of these were either unwilling to fight or were outright opposed to his rule. Without substantial help from the Don Cossacks, the tiny Volunteer Army was unable to prevent the Red Guards under Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko from overrunning the Don region in late February 1918. To escape the Red onslaught, the Volunteer Army was forced to flee south into the lands of the Kuban Cossack Host while Kaledin remained behind and committed suicide.Mueggenberg, Brent, The Cossack Struggle Against Communism, 1917 ‚Äì 1945 (Jefferson: McFarland, 2019) 51 - 55 During the months of March and April 1918, the Volunteer Army incorporated anticommunist Kuban Cossacks into its ranks and made an abortive attempt to capture the Kuban capital of Yekaterinodar from Red forces. Among the casualties in the latter operation was Kornilov, leaving General Anton Denikin to assume command of the Volunteer Army. In early May this so-called ‚ÄúIcy March‚Äù ended when the Volunteer Army returned to the Don Cossack Host, which by then was experiencing widespread revolts against Soviet occupation.Mawdsley, Evan, The Russian Civil War (New York: Pegasus, 2007) 21 - 22 The anticommunist insurrection in the Don began in early April 1918 amid Cossack and peasant furor against Bolshevik food- requisitioning detachments. As ordinary Don Cossacks eagerly took up arms that spring, a Don Cossack Army was formed and a new elected ataman, General Pyotr N. Krasnov, took office. Krasnov established cordial relations with the German army of occupation in neighboring Ukraine, and through them he received arms and munitions, some of which he forwarded to the Volunteer Army.Mueggenberg, 59 ‚Äì 62, 66 ‚Äì 71 During the summer and fall of 1918, the Don Cossacks under Krasnov continued to the campaign to liberate their homeland from the Red Army while Denikin‚Äôs Volunteer Army cleared the Kuban Cossack Host and other areas of the North Caucasus of Red forces. In the winter of 1918 ‚Äì 19, after the Volunteer Army had shattered the main Red forces in the North Caucasus, it redirected its efforts to the north in the Donbas region as the Don Cossacks again lost heart and began to give ground to their Red opponents.Mawdsley, 85 - 98 The Armed Forces of South Russia On 8 January 1919, as the Don Cossack Army was collapsing due to plummeting morale among its troops, Krasnov subordinated his forces to Denikin thereby creating the Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR). The Volunteer Army was renamed the Caucasian Volunteer Army. However, it reverted to its original name in May 1919. Besides the Volunteer and Don armies, the AFSR eventually included the Crimean-Azov Army, the Army of the Caucasus and the Army of Turkestan. In the spring of 1919, anticommunist revolts again erupted among Don Cossacks behind the Red Army front in the upper Don region. Despite considerable Soviet efforts to crush the rebellion, the Don Cossack insurgents managed to hold out until the Don Cossack Army was able to go over to the offensive and relieve them in early June. Meanwhile, the Volunteer Army in the Donbas region was also able to go over the offensive, managing to take Kharkiv on 25 June, Kursk on 20 September and Oryol on 13 October. On the eastern end of the AFSR‚Äôs front, the Caucasian Army under Baron Pyotr Wrangel captured Tsaritsyn on 30 June.Mawdsley, 161 - 177 Despite the AFSR‚Äôs successes in the summer and autumn of 1919, its rear was beset by rampant corruption among administrators, anti-White revolts among various ethnic groups, anarchist uprisings, pogroms against Jews and political infighting between the White generals and Cossack leaders. In October, Red Army counterattacks managed to recapture Oryol from the Volunteer Army while the Red Cavalry Corps under Semyon Budyonny drove a wedge between the Volunteer Army and Don Cossack Army. With no stable rear to fall back on, the remnants of the AFSR eventually retreated south to the Crimea and behind the Don River. In late February 1920, the Red Army renewed its attacks and succeeded in forcing the Whites to abandon the North Caucasus. Amid a disastrous evacuation at Novorossiysk, tens of thousands of Volunteer and Don Cossack troops did manage to embark on ships that transported them safely to the Crimean Peninsula. But due to insufficient tonnage, an even greater number of Cossack soldiers and civilians fleeing with the Whites were left behind at Novorossiysk where they were forced to either surrender or continue to retreat south.Mueggenberg, 161 - 177 After reaching the Crimea in early April 1920 Denikin, the Commander-in-chief of the AFSR, passed all his powers to General Wrangel, who re-formed these units into his Russian Army.Mawdsley, 224 - 225 Wrangel's Russian Army The formation of Wrangel's \\"Russian Army\\" heralded the last phase of the Russian Civil War in the South. The Crimean peninsula served as the White's last stronghold, where all the remnants of the other defeated White Armies gathered. In May 1920 the Reds destroyed the Army of the Caucasus, which had been part of the AFSR; the survivor's fled either to join Wrangel or to Georgia. By July 1920 Wrangel had 25,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, 13 tanks, 25 armoured cars, 40 aircraft, 2 battleships, 3 cruisers, 11 destroyers, 4 submarines and 8 gunboats. This expanded by October 1920 to 41,000 infantry and 17,000 cavalry. But despite the rise in manpower, Wrangel was unable to undertake a successful offensive towards Moscow or break out of his Crimean stronghold. A raid into the Kuban area in August 1920 under the command of General Sergei Georgievich Ulagay failed to expand White-held territory. The final assault on the Crimea by the Bolshevik re-constituted Southern Front (early November, 1920) under the command of Mikhail Frunze proved successful in defeating the last great White threat to the Reds. Entente vessels evacuated the last survivors of the White armies to Istanbul (16 November 1920). In 1921 they transferred to Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, where they finally disbanded. Ukraine in the Southern Front At the Same time, the Reds were also fighting against the Ukrainians, as well as the Poles. With the defeat of Germany in the First World War, the pro-German Government, The Hetmanate, under Pavlo Skoropadsky was overthrown and the relative safety Ukraine had under German occupation and protection was gone. The Reds set up their own Bolshevik Ukrainian government. The Ukrainian National Republic (UNR) faced many enemies from late 1918 onwards. It faced the Reds to the north-east, Whites (who were against Ukrainian separation) to the south-east marching northwards against Moscow and the Anarchist Black Army of Nestor Makhno springing up all over Ukraine. The UNR came to terms with the Rumanians and the Entente who occupied Odessa in February 1919, and this allowed the UNR to release troops to face the Whites, Reds and Poles. Fighting broke out in January 1919 and the Reds pushed the Ukrainian forces back. Kiev fell to the Reds in February 1919 and had pushed the UNR's forces against Polish ones moving into Volhynia. This cut the UNR's armies in two. By May 1919, the UNR occupied a small strip of land around Brody and at the same time were negotiating with the Poles, with an armistice with the Poles, the Ukrainians could push forwards and they attacked south-eastwards to Kamanets Podil'skyi. With Denikin launching an offensive against the Reds in the north, along with spontaneous peasant uprisings allowed the Ukrainians to retake Kiev in August 1919, but they were expelled by Denikin's forces. With Denikin's defeat and the Ukrainians in severe trouble, they made an alliance with the Poles in April 1920, the combined Polish-Ukrainian forces pushed back the Reds, who occupied most of Ukraine. This was part of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, and ended up with gains for Poland after the treaty of Riga in 1921, but with nothing for the Ukrainians who were fully defeated. The Ukrainians based in Poland tried to launch offensives and raids into Soviet Ukraine, but these failed considerably. Georgia in the Civil War With the defeat of the Whites in 1920, the Georgian Democratic Republic was under threat from the Red Army moving ever closer to her borders. The Reds offered an alliance with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in order to defeat the Whites in the Caucasus etc. The Georgians refused, going for a policy of neutrality; they also hoped they could negotiate their official independence with the Bolsheviks. Several attempts by Russians and Soviets to take over Georgia failed. In April 1920, the Soviets managed to place a Bolshevik regime in Azerbaijan, mainly due to the help of the 11th Soviet Red Army. Georgian communists asked for permission to take over Georgia but no real authorisation was given. On May 3, Communists loyal to the Russian SFSR launched a coup in Tbilisi, which was defeated by the Georgian army. The Georgian General staff started to mobilise and ready themselves for war, however this never came, as negotiations with the Reds (May 1920) managed to secure their independence, on the conditions that they allowed Bolshevik groups and organisations to exist and that no foreign troops could enter Georgian soil. Refused entry into the League of Nations, Georgia gained de jure recognition from the Allies on January 27, 1921. This, however, did not prevent the country from being attacked by Soviet Russia a month later. The peace with Georgia, though initially supported strongly by Lenin, finally ended on February 11 when the Armenian and Georgian Bolsheviks organized a revolt in Lorri. The Armenia-based 11th Red Army marched on Tbilisi, while other Russian forces invaded from various directions. By February 25, the desperate resistance of the poorly organized Georgian military was broken at the capital and the Georgian Bolsheviks proclaimed the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. Almost simultaneously, Turkish troops took control over Ardahan Province, Artvin and Batumi. On March 17, the Menshevik and Soviet representatives agreed to a ceasefire and joined their efforts to recover Batumi. On March 18, the leadership of the DRG left Georgia by the French ship Ernest Renan. By the Moscow-dictated Treaty of Kars with Turkey (October 13, 1921), Georgia had to abandon its claims on Artvin and Ardahan provinces in return for Batumi granted autonomous status within Soviet Georgia. Abkhazia and South Ossetia also gained autonomy. Qoroghli, near Tbilisi, has a monument to the Georgian Junkers who fell in battles against the Red Army. Guerrilla resistance to the Soviet troops continued, but was finally crushed in 1924. This was followed by harsh repressions and the reign of terror in which thousands of Georgian nobles, intellectuals and common citizens were purged. The country was eventually incorporated into the Soviet Union ‚Äî first as a part of a Transcaucasian SFSR (1922), then as its own Soviet Socialist Republic (1936). Armenia Since 1918, the Armenian Republic had been at odds with almost all of her neighbours, several wars were fought with her fellow newly formed Caucasian nations, as well as a hard- fought war with the Turks in 1920. With enemies all around, the Armenians were weak and unable to defend themselves against an invasion by the Bolsheviks. Azerbaijan By March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack the much-needed Baku. Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified by the fact that Soviet Russia couldn't survive without Baku oil. According to prevailing opinion in Moscow, Russian Bolsheviks were to assist Baku proletariat in overthrowing the \\"counter-revolutionary nationalists.\\" After major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic gave its resignations on April 1, 1920. On April 25, 1920, the Russian XI Red Army crossed into Azerbaijan and entered Baku on April 27. They demanded the dissolution of Azerbaijani Parliament (Majlis) and set up their own Bolshevik government headed by Nariman Narimanov. The deputies obliged to do so to avoid bloodshed, and on April 28, 1920, the ADR officially ceased to exist. The Red Army met very little resistance from Azerbaijani forces in Baku, which were tied up on Karabakh front. In May 1920, there was a major uprising against the occupying Russian XI Army in Ganja, intent on restoring Musavatists in power. The uprising was crushed by the Bolsheviks by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to Menshevik Georgia, Turkey and Iran, or were captured by Bolsheviks, like Mammed Amin Rasulzade (who was later allowed to emigrate) and executed (like Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen. Agalarov, a total of over 20 generals), or assassinated by Armenian militants like Fatali Khan Khoyski and Behbudagha Javanshir. Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries never to return again to their country.

She served in the Finnish Navy during World War II. The ship was named after Turuma, a type of frigate designed for use in shallow waters of the archipelago and served in the Swedish Archipelago fleet in the late 18th century. The frigates had in turn been named after the region of Finland. During construction while in Russian lists (1916‚Äì1917) the ship had been named both Orlan and Tshirok. Turunmaa was built in Helsinki for the Imperial Russian Navy but was taken over by Finnish troops in the Finnish Civil War. The ship was used as a training ship for Finnish sea cadets during peacetime and was nicknamed as Surunmaa (land of sorrow). Interwar period In the second half of 1919, Turunmaa, amongst other Finnish naval vessels, was tasked with security and patrol duties in the Koivisto region where the British naval detachment was located. On 4 September 1939, Turunmaa as part of the Coastal Fleet was moved to the Sea of √Öland. However, for the rest of the autumn, Turunmaa patrolled the waters from Kotka to Koivisto together with Karjala. Winter War On 1 December 1939 Turunmaa was covering the minelaying effort by auxiliary minelayer Suomi south-east of Isosaari. Turunmaa join to the Coastal Fleet near √Öland in mid December 1939. She participated in anti-submarine patrols which continued until the sea froze on 30 January. Continuation War Turunmaa was tasked with escort duties at the start of the Continuation War. She was detached from that duty following the Soviet attack to Bengtsk√§r and ordered to rejoin the rest of the Finnish gunboats. On 29 August Turunmaa together with , and escorted by and sailed through the main Soviet minebarrier south of Hanko to the eastern Gulf of Finland. After island of Sommers had been thought to be unmanned following the shelling of the island by on 9 October 1941 Finns prepared to occupy it. Turunmaa was escorting the landing force in its failed attempt to land on 11 October as the landing force turned back before reaching the shore when Soviets opened fire. On 29 October Turunmaa together with Karjala shelled the island. On 1942 Turunmaa like other Finnish gunboats was tasked with guarding of the minebarriers northeast of Hogland and performing anti-submarine patrols in the same region. On 8 August Turunmaa was sortied to fend off the Soviet attack on Someri but arrived several hours after H√§meenmaa and Uusimaa. Turunmaa shelled both the nearby Soviet vessels as well as positions of the Soviet landing force on the island. After the naval action had already ended Turunmaa was slightly damaged by a near-miss by a bomb and suffered some crew losses (2 dead, 8 wounded) as overheated barrels of both of the 20mm Madsen guns aboard exploded. On 2 May 1943 while guarding the mine barriers northeast of Hogland, Turunmaa was seriously damaged in an air raid and the sinking ship had to be beached to shallow water at Haapasaaret (group of islands south from Kotka). Crew casualties were 1 dead and 9 wounded. The ship was immediately refloated and was fully repaired by 23 October 1943. When Soviet summer offensive of 1944 started Turunmaa was first part of the flotilla evacuating the Koivisto region. And later took part in the fighting at Bay of Viborg on 4 July 1944 as part of the Battle Group Arho consisting of Finnish and German light naval units. While defending against repeated air attacks and attacks by motor torpedo boats two bombs exploded under the boilerroom of Turunmaa. Turunmaa started leaking and the aft gun was jammed and the ship was temporarily unable to participate to the action. This and other damages to the ships of the Battle Group Arho led to its withdrawal from action.

All deliver amplification of the coxswain's voice using a microphone and series of wired loudspeakers. Use Cox boxes are mainly used in eights and fours, where the readouts are used by the coxswain to monitor the performance of the crew and manage the race. This is of particular importance in Head of the River (time trial) races where the crews race line astern and so performance of other crews cannot be easily gauged. It is also critical to assisting the coxswain in sticking to the race plan, which usually involves strategic changes of rating. The amplifier is linked to one or more loudspeakers along the boat making it easier for the crew to hear commands, this is particularly important for the rower in the bow seat as they are often furthest away. The coxswain typically wears a headband- mounted microphone, which is attached by a wire and quick release to the amplifier. Some units allow a walkie-talkie connection to the coach so they can use the amplification to speak directly to the crew as well. Rowing shells fitted with speed measuring impellers or GPS can report boat speed to the amplifier display, typically measured in Meters/second or 500 meters predicted split time. GPS speed measurement is presently only on Coxmate SCT and SX units. History Before the development of the Cox Box by Nielsen-Kellerman, a megaphone strapped to the head of the coxswain was used to make the coxswain easier to hear, and the coxswain used an analog stop watch and rate watch - quite a handful when also trying to steer a 60' long racing shell! The use of a system with multiple speakers also became much more important when racing eight construction switched to sealed bulkhead sections to ensure the boat would remain safely buoyant even when damaged. This is because sound could no longer travel down the hull as was possible with the previous open style of construction.  Strokes per minute (SPM) or rating  Almost all modern coxswain's amplifier systems have a liquid crystal display, showing the strokes per minute (SPM). On most systems, a magnet is positioned under the stroke man's seat. In bowloaded boats, the magnet is placed under the bow man's seat. As the rower moves up the slide (moving forward to prepare for the next stroke), a measurement is taken, and fed to the system. The stroke seat (first rower in the stern) sets the rate of rowing for the whole crew so this is very important. The display also usually features a timer which can be stopped, cleared, and reset, along with a stroke counter. For rows in poor lighting, the display is also equipped with a backlight.

Born to an Irish-speaking family in Carna, County Galway, Ireland, √âamon a B√∫rc, was brought by his parents to Graceville, Minnesota in 1880. Their passage was paid for by Archbishop John Ireland, who wished to fill up the Minnesota prairie with Irish-American farm families. After a severe blizzard struck on 15 October 1880, the condition of the Connemara refugees became an international scandal. The a B√∫rc family was evicted from their claim and resettled in a Saint Paul, Minnesota shantytown which was dubbed the Connemara Patch. √âamon and his father went to work for the Great Northern Railway of James J. Hill. After losing a leg in a work-related accident, √âamon returned to Ireland and went to work as a tailor at his home in the village of Aill na Br√≥n, near his native Carna. In the Fall of 1935, he was visited by S√©amus √ì Duilearga and Liam Mac Coisdeala, representatives of the Irish Folklore Commission. They recorded his repertoire of legends and folk poetry on a collection of Ediphone cylinders. The recordings were later transcribed, filling more than 2,000 pages of manuscript. The Encyclopaedia of Ireland states: \\"He was perhaps the finest storyteller collected from in the twentieth century. The longest folk-tale ever recorded in Ireland - taking three nights to tell and amounting to more than 30,000 words - was collected from him.\\" See also *Seancha√≠ Sources * \\"The Encyclopaedia of Ireland,\\" 2003; . * Bridget Connelly, \\"Forgetting Ireland; Uncovering a Family's Secret History,\\" Borealis Books, Minnesota Historical Society, 2003. * Sean O'Sullivan, \\"Folktales of Ireland,\\" University of Chicago, 1966.

Biomarkers assess disease susceptibility and severity, which allows one to predict outcomes, determine interventions and evaluate therapeutic responses. From a forensics and epidemiologic perspective, biomarkers offer unique insight about the relationships between environmental risk factors. Classes of Biomarkers Three broad classes of biomarkers are prognostic biomarkers, predictive biomarkers and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Prognostic Biomarkers Prognostic biomarkers give intervention- independent information on disease status through screening, diagnosis and disease monitoring. Prognostic biomarkers can signify individuals in the latent period of a disease's natural history, allowing optimal therapy and prevention until the disease's termination. Prognostic biomarkers give information on disease status by measuring the internal precursors that increase or decrease the likelihood of attaining a disease. For example, blood pressure and cholesterol are biomarkers for CVD. Prognostic biomarkers can be direct or indirect to the causal pathway of a disease. If a prognostic biomarker is a direct step in the causal pathway, it is one of the factors or products of the disease. A prognostic biomarker could be indirectly associated with a disease if it is related to a change caused by the exposure, or related to an unknown factor connected with the exposure or disease. Predictive Biomarkers Predictive biomarkers measure the effect of a drug and tell if the drug is having its expected activity, but do not offer any direct information on the disease. Predictive biomarkers are highly sensitive and specific; therefore they increase diagnostic validity of a drug or toxin's site-specific effect by eliminating recall bias and subjectivity from those exposed. For example, when an individual is exposed to a drug or toxin, the concentration of that drug or toxin within the body, or the biological effective dose, provides a more accurate prediction for the effect of the drug or toxin compared to an estimation or measurement of the toxin from the origin or external environment. Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers can measure the direct interaction between a drug and its receptor. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers reveal drug mechanisms, if the drug has its intended effect on the biology of the disease, ideal biological dosing concentrations, and physiologic response/resistance mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers are particularly relevant in drug mechanisms of tumor cells, where pharmacodynamic endpoints for drug interventions can be assessed directly on tumor tissues. For example, protein phosphorylation biomarkers indicate alterations in target protein kinases and activation of downstream signaling molecules. Clinical Applications for Biomarkers Biomarkers can be classified on their clinical applications as molecular biomarkers, cellular biomarkers or imaging biomarkers. Molecular Biomarkers Four of the main types of molecular biomarkers are genomic biomarkers, transcriptomic biomarkers, proteomic biomarkers and metabolic biomarkers. Genomic Biomarkers Genomic biomarkers analyze DNA by identifying irregular sequences in the genome, typically a single nucleotide polymorphism. Genetic biomarkers are particularly significant in cancer because most cancer cell lines carry somatic mutations. Somatic mutations are distinguishable from hereditary mutations because the mutation is not in every cell; just the tumor cells, making them easy targets. Transcriptomic Biomarkers Transcriptomic biomarkers analyze all RNA molecules, not solely the exome. Transcriptomic biomarkers reveal the molecular identity and concentration of RNA in a specific cell or population. Pattern-based RNA expression analysis provides increased diagnostic and prognostic capability in predicting therapeutic responses for individuals. For example, distinct RNA subtypes in breast cancer patients have different survival rates. Proteomic Biomarkers Proteomics permits the quantitative analysis and detection of changes to proteins or protein biomarkers. Protein biomarkers detect a variety of biological changes, such as protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications and immunological responses.  Cellular Biomarkers  Cellular biomarkers allow cells to be isolated, sorted, quantified and characterized by their morphology and physiology. Cellular biomarkers are used in both clinical and laboratory settings, and can discriminate between a large sample of cells based on their antigens. An example of a cellular biomarker sorting technique is Fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Imaging Biomarkers Imaging biomarkers allow earlier detection of disease compared to molecular biomarkers, and streamline translational research in the drug discovery marketplace. For example, one could determine the percent of receptors a drug targets, shortening the time and money of research during the new drug development stage. Imaging biomarkers also are non-invasive, which is a clinical advantage over molecular biomarkers. Some of the image-based biomarkers are X-Ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photo Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Examples of Biomarkers * Embryonic: Embryonic biomarkers are very important to fetuses, as each cell's role is decided through the use of biomarkers. Research has been conducted concerning the use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in regenerative medicine. This is because certain biomarkers within a cell could be altered (most likely in the tertiary stage of their formation) to change the future role of the cell, thereby creating new ones. One example of an embryonic biomarker is the protein Oct-4. *Multiplex analysis of circulating tumor cells using QuantiGene ViewRNA CTC PlatformCancer: Biomarkers have an extremely high upside for therapeutic interventions in cancer patients. Most cancer biomarkers consist of proteins or altered segments of DNA, and are expressed in all cells, just at higher rates in cancer cells. There has not yet been one, universal tumor biomarker, but there is a biomarker for every type of cancer. These tumor biomarkers are used to track the health of tumors, but cannot serve as the sole diagnostic for specific cancers. Examples of tumoral markers used to follow up cancer treatment are the Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) for colorectal cancer and the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer. In 2014, Cancer research identified Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) and Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) as metastasizing tumor biomarkers with special cellular differentiation and prognostic skills. Innovative technology needs to be harnessed to determine the full capabilities of CTCs and ctDNA, but insight into their roles has potential for new understanding of cancer evolution, invasion and metastasis.

It was established in 1490 following the disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate. History Background The origin of the name Berar or Warhad (‡§µ‡§±‡•ç‡§π‡§æ‡§°) as it is spelled in Marathi, is not known. The first authentic records show it to have been part of the Andhra or Satavahana empire. On the fall of the Chalukyas in the 12th century, Berar came under the sway of the Yadavas of Deogiri, and remained in their possession until the Muslim invasions at the end of the 13th century. On the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan (1348), Berar was constituted one of the five provinces into which their kingdom was divided, being governed by great nobles, with a separate army. The perils of this system became apparent when the province was divided (1478 or 1479) into two separate provinces, named after their capitals Gawil and Mahur. The Bahmani dynasty was, however, already tottering to its fall. Establishment of the Berar Sultanate During the disintegration of Bahmani sultanate, in 1490 Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk, governor of Gawil, who had formerly held all Berar, proclaimed his independence and founded the Imad Shahi dynasty of Berar sultanate. He proceeded to annex Mahur to his new kingdom and had capital at Ellichpur. Imad-ul-Mulk was by birth a Kanarese Hindu, but had been captured as a boy in one of the expeditions against the Vijayanagara empire and brought up as a Muslim. Gavilgad and Narnala were also fortified by him. He died in 1504 and his successor, Ala-ud-din resisted the aggression of Ahmadnagar with the help from Bahadur Shah, sultan of Gujarat. The next ruler, Darya tried to align with Bijapur to prevent aggression of Ahamadnagar, but was unsuccessful. In 1568 when Burhan Imad Shah was deposed by his minister Tufail Khan, and assumed the kingship. This gave a pretext for the intervention of Murtaza Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar, who invaded Berar, imprisoned and put to death Tufail Khan, his son Shams-ul-Mulk, and the ex-king Burhan, and annexed Berar to his own dominions of Ahmednagar sultanate.

Early career From 1928 to 1938 MacPherson was the resident organist at the Empire, Leicester Square, before being appointed BBC Theatre Organist in succession to Reginald Foort, the first holder of that position. During the war years, Macpherson instituted parents speaking to their evacuee children in America live on the radio. He ran a number of request programmes, for instance 'From My Postbag' and 'At Your Request', and on a Sunday evening 'The Twilight Hour'. He also put out programmes with other artistes, for instance, Robinson Cleaver and his wife Molly (who played organ and grand piano), Stephane Grappelli, Oscar Grasso, Gladys Ripley and Isobel Bailey. He even auditioned a young Julie Andrews. During WW2 When the BBC briefly switched to broadcasting only light music in September 1939, MacPherson played up to twelve hours per day, also filling in with announcements and programme-notes whilst the organisation hastily evacuated its staff from London to various locations around the British Isles. Pressure from listeners and the press, who quickly tired of this seemingly unending diet of theatre organ day after day, soon caused the BBC to resume broadcasting a wider range of music. In the dark days of late 1939 - early 1940, Sandy's original signature tune, \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" was decidedly inappropriate to the times and he replaced it with his own composition, \\"I'll Play To You\\", a slow waltz which he used throughout the rest of his career (written with Harry S Pepper, a BBC producer). He played the opening music to the radio programme called London After Dark, on the theatre organ in St. George's Hall, London, broadcast 24 August 1940. In 1942, his habits of playing on the theatre organ and tiring the British public were mocked by Tommy Handley in an episode of It's That Man Again, in which Handley said: \\"You'll see many a worse 'un Sandy MacPherson!\\" Initially during the war MacPherson regularly broadcast on the BBC from the original BBC Theatre Organ (a 4-manual 23-rank Compton) in St. George's Hall until that instrument was destroyed in the blitz on 10 May 1941. Sandy himself was then evacuated and continued to broadcast on a Hammond organ until Reginald Foort lent the BBC his travelling Moller pipe-organ, which was installed in Bangor, Wales, close to Macpherson's then home of Llandudno. At the end of WWII, the BBC purchased the Moller from Foort and moved it to the Jubilee Chapel, Hoxton, East London, where it remained until 1963. Post- war In the early fifties he was best known for his regular programme of light-religious music 'The Chapel in the Valley'. Sandy introduced the programme, whilst \\"Mr Drewett\\" played the organ. \\"Mr Drewett\\" was actually Charles Drewett Smart, another theatre organist from the early days. Sandy also had a request programme running at the same time which concentrated on slightly lighter music and was very popular with the older generation. After WW2 Sandy also periodically gave recitals on parish church organs in England and Wales. He retired from the position of BBC Theatre Organist in 1963 and the BBC sold the 5-manual 27-rank Moller organ, it being assumed that the days of theatre-organ music were over, with audience numbers for this genre fast declining. (The instrument is now installed in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, having spent periods in Hilversum, Holland, and in a pizza parlour in San Diego, California, USA.) After retirement, Sandy continued to broadcast from time to time, usually on the 4-manual 16-rank Wurlitzer in the Gaumont State Cinema, Kilburn, North London. TV appearances He was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Death He died on his 78th birthday, 3 March 1975.

Karjala was named after the Finnic cultural region of Karelia. Like her sister ship , she served as cadet training vessel during peacetime and was nicknamed as Kurjala (place of misery) by cadets. Interwar period From summer of 1919 Karjala amongst other Finnish naval vessels was tasked with security and patrol duties the Koivisto region where the British naval detachment was located. During prohibition in Finland in 1925 some illegal alcohol had been smuggled onboard Karjala by cadets. Some of the alcohol was spilled to a nearby lantern which ignited the liquid resulting in an explosion which injured several cadets. Event became known as the 'second blast of Karelia' after the Viborg blast of 1495. On 4 September 1939 Karjala as part of the Coastal Fleet was moved to the Sea of √Öland. However, as Karjala was replaced by the ship sailed to Kotka already on 18 September. For the rest of the autumn Karjala patrolled the waters from Kotka to Koivisto together with Turunmaa. Winter War On 4 December 1939 had Finnish coastal facilities at Koivisto saw lights moving in the sea. This appeared to be minesweeping effort for two days later group of Soviet destroyers sailed in to shell Finnish coastal facilities. On 7 December 1939 Karjala was sent to tow along with three motor torpedo boats to Koivisto both to lay mines and to intercept the Soviet ships. Detachment however did not succeed in either of its goals. On 4 January 1940 Karjala arrived to √Öland to join with the Coastal Fleet. She participated in anti-submarine patrols which continued until the sea froze on 30 January. Continuation War On 29 August Karjala together with her sister ship , and gunboats H√§meenmaa and were escorted by and through the main Soviet mine barrier south of Hanko to the eastern Gulf of Finland. While returning with Uusimaa from escorting a troop ship on 3 September Karjala was bombed by German Heinkel He 111 bomber near Koivisto. Though the aircraft scored no direct hits the shocks from several near-misses forced Karjala to undergo repairs at a shipyard. On 29 October Karjala which had just returned from repairs joined with Turunmaa in shelling the island of Sommers, where a Finnish landing attempt had previously been turned back. Most of the war Karjala like other Finnish gunboats was tasked with guarding of the mine barriers north-east of Hogland and performing anti-submarine patrols in the same region. However, when it became apparent on 12 July 1942 that Soviet submarines had managed to bypass the mine barrier Karjala was sent to strengthen the escorts protecting the shipping between Sweden and Finland.

Born in Manchester, he played for Goslings before joining the now-famous Manchester United Junior Athletic Club (MUJAC). He made his debut for Manchester United in 1952, but struggled to nail down a regular place in the starting XI and was sold to Preston North End in 1955. A year later, he transferred to West Ham United, with Frank O'Farrell moving in the opposite direction. In 1958, he was part of the West Ham team that finished on top of the Second Division before joining Leyton Orient. At Leyton Orient, Lewis was converted from his former position at centre-forward to become the team's regular left-back, and he was part of the team that was promoted to the First Division in 1962 and relegated just a year later. In May 1964, Lewis joined Folkestone Town, before embarking on a short managerial career with Clapton and Ford Sports. In 1970, Lewis emigrated to South Africa, where he was involved in coaching several sides, including Wits University, Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows. He also worked as an analyst for SuperSport. He contracted cancer in his later years and died in May 2011. Career Born in Manchester, Lewis was one of the original Busby Babes. He played for Goslings and then for the Manchester United Junior Athletic Club (MUJAC), joining the Old Trafford ground staff in the 1947‚Äì48 season. He made 24 appearances for United during the 1950s and scored 11 goals, but was never a regular first-team player due to fierce competition from Bobby Charlton, Liam Whelan, Tommy Taylor and Dennis Viollet. In 1956 Lewis signed for West Ham United from Preston North End in a swap deal that saw Frank O'Farrell move in the other direction. He helped West Ham win promotion during the 1957‚Äì58 season, and did the same with Leyton Orient in 1961‚Äì62. He was converted from centre forward to full back with Leyton Orient, and probably played his best seasons in that position. He went on to play for Folkestone Town and later managed Clapton and Ford Sports in the Greater London League. Lewis emigrated to South Africa in 1970 and ‚Äì after a short spell selling insurance ‚Äì he spent time as a part-time coach of Primary School Soccer at Glenhazel Primary school in the 1980s, and Wits University, Kaizer Chiefs, Giant Blackpool, Moroka Swallows, Manning Rangers, Free State Stars and AmaZulu. He also worked as an analyst for the TV sports station SuperSport and also for PA Sports. In July 2007, 72-year-old Lewis was appointed as a technical advisor for Moroka Swallows under their new manager Ian Gorowa, a former Zimbabwe international striker.

It was in operation since before 1993, when it applied sanctions against the Government of Libya. More recently, since Libya became an ally of the United Kingdom, sanctions have been applied against those who allegedly fought against the Government of Libya at the time it was not an ally (see Incidents which have involved the Financial Sanctions Unit). Responsibility for the administration of Financial Sanctions in the UK transferred from the Bank of England to HM Treasury on 24 October 2007. In April 2016 HM Treasury set up the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, a new body whose mission is to \\"provide a high-quality service to the private sector, working closely with law enforcement to help ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced.\\" Regimes Financial sanctions have established under a multitude of regimes, from UN Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1267 (1999) Concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and Associated Individuals and Entities, to EC Commission Regulations, to UK Government orders enforcing trade restrictions against activities in particular countries. Often these authorities overlap so that the same candidates for sanctions are listed from different sources. Aside from the Al- Qaida and the Taliban regimes, there are sanctions regimes against persons associated with Belarus, Burma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Syria, Liberia, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Previous regimes, which have been lifted, involved Angola, Haiti and Libya. Many of these measures targeting terrorist organizations have been subsumed into the general provisions of an order which came into force on 12 October 2006, the day after it was laid before Parliament. The new order allows for HM Treasury to target anyone they suspect may be attempting to participate in the commissions of acts of terrorism, and anyone who works on their behalf. This includes by default all those identified by the Security Council committee. The main instrument for administering the financial sanctions is the publication of a Consolidated list of financial sanctions targets which can be used by banks and other financial institutions to scan their customer databases and discover financial assets controlled by those who are the targets of the sanctions.  Similar measures  The Charity Commission also has powers to freeze the bank accounts of organizations that are registered charities that it suspects are connected with terrorism. Politics Financial sanctions regimes are usually passed as secondary legislation on the basis of an earlier Act of Parliament. There are statements made about the process in Parliament, but no sign of an official debate. The power to impose sanctions against suspects designated by the United Nations Security Council is derived from the United Nations Act 1946, and so is not thought to require further approval. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, takes an interest in financial sanctions policy against terrorism, and has made it the subject of major speeches. On 12 October 2006, he announced the broadening of the law to allow for financial sanctions to apply without the need of a UN or EU mandate, and solely on the basis of secret intelligence. He called his department's handling of the 19 suspects involved in the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot \\"the most expeditious and most comprehensive asset freeze the Treasury has undertaken\\", and claims that \\"since September 11th almost 200 accounts have been frozen linked to over 100 organisations with suspected connections to Al Qaeda.\\" These were handled as part of the previous regime, by designating those individuals as being connected with Al-Qaeda, without any evidence presented to the public beyond a press release. Legal challenges Several of the targeted people have brought their case before the Court of First Instance on the basis that the measures infringe fundamental principles of Community law (such as European Convention on Human Rights which ensures the right of fair trial, and no punishment without law). On 12 July 2006, Faraj Hassan and Chafik Ayadi, both UK residents who had been listed under the regime since 2002, had their cases dismissed with the statement that: > ...the Court... recognise[s] that freezing of funds constitutes a > particularly drastic measure, but adds that that measure does not prevent > the individuals concerned from leading a satisfactory personal, family and > social life, given the circumstances.

The show was previously based in New York City on 92.3 Free FM, and prior to that aired on Clear Channel's Wild 94.9 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The New York show was canceled in May 2007, due to a controversy over a segment that it aired involving a prank call to a Chinese restaurant. The co-hosts and the producer were subsequently fired by the station and CBS Radio. In March 2008, they began broadcasting a new show via the web.  History  The Dog House stars JV (Jeff Vandergrift) and Elvis (Dan Lay). The two met in 1993 and have been radio cohosts together for over 15 years, (along with JV's high school friend and show producer \\"Hollywood\\" Lance Otani) starting on Hot 97.7 in San Jose, California. In 1995, program directors Michael Martin and Joe Cunningham of Wild 107 eagerly hired them to fill a timeslot vacated by Mancow Muller. The Dog House quickly became a household name after joining Wild 107.7 (which subsequently moved to Wild 94.9), as they became the #1 rated morning show in the Bay AreaThe Doghouse is the top-rated morning program in the Bay Area in the demographic age groups 12-24 and 18-34. receiving higher ratings than Howard Stern; [Stern's] show is second to KYLD'S \\"Doghouse\\" in the morning slot. only to be terminated several years later due to off-air controversy. Shortly after being fired from Wild 94.9, they helped launch KIFR at the end of 2005 before moving to New York City, where they joined 92.3 Free FM. The new show went under the title JV & Elvis during the first few months until the hosts revived The Dog House name. Two years later they were fired again by CBS Radio in New York for an on-air prank. Post Free FM The Dog House hosted a show on their website. It was a multimedia broadcast enabling them to display pictures and video as well as audio. On May 15, 2008, Elvis left, expressing a desire to return to terrestrial radio. JV continued to host the show alone. On February 16, 2009, JV announced he would be coming back to Wild 94.9, the same station that he and the Dog House were fired from in 2005. JV's show started on Monday February 23 and currently airs 6am-10am. On Monday morning, October 12, 2009, Elvis restarted The Dog House as his morning show on KFRH/KREV basing it both in Las Vegas (KFRH) and the S.F. Bay Area (KREV). The show rotated its broadcast home between studios in the two cities. In August 2014, the duo announced that they would be restarting the Dog House show, this time starting with weekly podcasts using the online-based Stitcher Radio. They've since aired several podcasts, but have repeatedly stated that they want to focus more on talk radio, rather than \\"stunts, pranks, etc.\\" To advertise their reunion, JV, Elvis, and Natasha Yi co-starred in a short film series called \\"Behind the House.\\"  Personalities  Host JV (Jeff Vandergrift) and Elvis (Dan Lay) both co-host The Dog House radio show.

Controversy  Feud with Brad Kava Throughout its history, the show had a feud with Brad Kava, a broadcast columnist for the San Jose Mercury News. The station once responded to his negative reviews of The Dog House with a large ad in the newspaper that read: \\"FUN RADIO IS BACK Bringing You a Mad-Kap Cup of Morning Java!\\" with two hands framing a photo of JV & Elvis. But when folded inward, similar to a MAD fold-in, the ad then read \\"FUCK Brad Kava\\" with the hands forming an upraised middle finger. Over 10 years later, the Dog House invited Kava as a guest on their internet show to work out their differences; Kava even praised the show, saying they were \\"pioneering a new medium\\". Feud with Opie & Anthony On September 28 2006, The Opie & Anthony Show, which immediately precedes The Dog House, was extended half an hour into The Dog House's time slot and CBS Radio played fifteen minutes of commercials before The Dog House was allowed on the air. JV and Elvis complained on the air about having to wait, which prompted Opie and Anthony to call in to the show. The hosts from the two shows then engaged in a bitter argument.Free FM FeedXM Feed The following day, Opie and Anthony intentionally ran overtime by almost twenty minutes to anger The Dog House. In response, Dog House fans showed support for The Dog House during their on-location broadcast (live from the Javitz center) by shouting chants such as \\"Opie and Anthony suck\\". The two shows later made up their differences after Don Imus was fired by CBS. Prank call to a Chinese restaurant On April 20, 2007, JV replayed a six-minute-long segment of a prank call to a Chinese restaurant that was first broadcast on April 5. The call featured an exaggerated voice using racial stereotypes (examples include \\"Chinese man, tell me about your tiny egg roll... your tiny egg roll in your pants\\", \\"Should I come to your restaurant so that I can see you naked... that way I can see your hot Asian spicy ass\\", and \\"You are a very nice Chinese man... probably can't drive for shit, but who cares.\\"). Several Chinese American special interest groups, including the Organization of Chinese Americans, were outraged by this segment, describing it as \\"racist, vulgar and sexist.\\". On April 23, the duo were suspended indefinitely without pay. JV apologized on the show the following Monday.CBS Radio Suspends 2 For Racial Prank The show was later canceled due to its racist and offensive content, with CBS Radio spokeswoman Karen Mateo stating, \\"The Dog House with JV and Elvis will no longer be broadcast.\\"  Media  At KYLD, The Dog House branched out into comedy CDs and DVDs, most of which were given away to listeners or sold by local music shops and online.

Tobias \\"Theo\\" Leendert Bamberg (1875‚Äì1963) was a professional magician. Born in the Netherlands, Bamberg performed under the name Okito which is an anagram of Tokio (Tokyo). His father had been court magician to King William III of the Netherlands, making Okito the sixth generation in a family of outstanding magicians known as the Bamberg Magical Dynasty. Early life Bamberg was the son of Judic Simon Delden and David Tobias Bamberg.https://goudsmit.home.xs4all.nl/CollateralFamiliesPersonsV2/wc37_209.htm His family were Dutch Jews.https://www.ochjs.ac.uk/wp- content/uploads/2011/08/OCHJS-Annual-Report-2009-10-.pdf As a young boy, Theo Bamberg nearly drowned while ice skating. The accident left him almost completely deaf and as a result, he performed entirely in pantomime. As a young man, inspired by a performance of the great French magician, shadowist and mimic Felecien Trewey, Bamberg developed a shadowgraphy routine which he performed professionally, beginning in his early teens. Early career In 1893, Bamberg created his first Japanese-style act in Berlin at the age of eighteen. Success was virtually immediate, but he eventually abandoned the show to elope with the theater manager's daughter. Shortly after, his new wife convinced him to change his name from \\"Tobias/Toby\\" to \\"Theodore/Theo\\". When he returned to performing, Bamberg altered his Japanese act to become a Chinese-style act to better facilitate a new illusion he had designed. Unlike William Ellsworth Robinson who performed as Chung Ling Soo, Bamberg didn't make an attempt to hide his European identity. February 1907 brought the birth of his son David Bamberg (who would later perform under the Stage name Fu Manchu) in England. Bamberg and his family eventually moved to The United States of America where, beginning in 1908, Okito worked as an off-stage assistant/advisor and on-stage feature in the shows of illusionist Howard Thurston. On the Thurston show, he was billed as \\"Europe's Greatest Shadowist.\\" Later career In 1909, through SAM, Bamberg had become friends with other notable magicians including Clement de Lion, Nate Leipzig, and many others. Frustrated with his lack of success, Theo sold his Okito act to a Brooklyn magician and plumbing contractor, W.J. \\"Doc\\" Nixon. It was in that year that Bamberg opened, with partner Joe Klein, the Bamberg Magic & Novelty Co. in New York City. The company was the primary representative of the German firm of Carl Willmann. While minding the store and toying with a pillbox, Bamberg invented his famous Okito box used to perform coin magic.Bobo, J.B: Okito coin box, page 217. Dover, 1982. Eventually, Bamberg returned to the road (playing vaudeville and variety theatres), selling his interest in the shop to Klein. Bamberg's skills were such that existing handmade props created by Bamberg are highly prized by collectors today. Many of Okito's props were described by Robert Albo in his Classic Magic with Apparatus and The Ultimate Okito series. Eventually, Doc Nixon gave Theo the \\"Okito\\" title back. Discarding the old act, Okito built many larger effects that would make him into a legend. When he returned to Europe, success finally found him. He traveled the world working large prestigious contracts. He was reunited with his son David and made him his assistant like his father did and his father's father as well. Following a South American and European tour in 1932, Theo decided to settle down and he returned to the Netherlands. Meanwhile, David had established himself in South America and persuaded his father to come and visit him. Okito did so just as the Nazis invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. As a result, all of his possessions were either confiscated or destroyed. Theo Bamberg, known as Okito and frequently billed on posters as The Mystic ended his last years in Chicago where he won the friendship, respect and admiration of everyone interested in magic. and died in 1963.

Until then, stirrup socks had been an integral part of the traditional baseball uniform, giving them a distinctive look. A high sock was needed because baseball players wore knickerbockers (\\"knickers\\"), worn by many boys in the late 19th century and into the 20th century. The stirrup socks served to display team colors, stripes or team logos. For example, for several years the Minnesota Twins wore navy-blue stirrups with \\"TC\\" on the side, for \\"Twin Cities\\", and in 1987 an \\"m\\" was placed on side. The Houston Astros wore navy blue stirrup socks with an orange star on the side. The stirrup sock colors were also the basis of team names, including the Cincinnati Red Stockings, Boston Red Sox, and Chicago White Sox. For these reasons, traditionalists lament the recent \\"sockless\\" look in baseball uniforms. Stirrup socks are worn on top of long socks called \\"sanitaries,\\" usually white in color.At Baseball and socks appeal. Vitez, Michael (August 29, 2011). Philly.com. The Philadelphia Inquirer. Retrieved 2011-09-02. \\"This led to the invention of the two-in-one, a white sock with a colored stripe down the side, an innovation that all but ensured the demise of the stirrup.\\" This is because early color dyes in the outer stirrup sock were thought to pose health issues, as well as the fact that the inner, less expensive white sock could be changed more frequently. The stirrup sock lacked a foot, instead having a loop (\\"stirrup\\") which fits within the arch of the foot. Over the years, the stirrup loop tended to get longer, exposing more of the white undersock, thus creating a look unique to baseball. However, by the 1980s many players were pulling the loop so high that only the white undersock and the loop itself showed ‚Äì the rest of the game sock being hidden by their pants. Eventually, this reached a point where some players only wore vertical lines for stirrups. For many years teams had enforced rules so that uniforms were worn \\"uniformly\\", including team socks. For example, Leo Durocher, longtime manager of the Chicago Cubs, had a measuring stick in the clubhouse. Players were required to match the length of their stirrup loops to this stick at about 4 inches, exposing only a small part of the white sanitary. Increasingly lax regulation of uniform codes by MLB eventually contributed to players ignoring the traditional look. The Official Baseball Rules are silent on stirrups, but the fact that some players on a team wear them while others do not seems to be in violation of Rule 1.11(a)(1) which states that \\"all players on a team shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim and style,\\" as well as Rule 1.11(a)(3) that states \\"no player whose uniform does not conform to that of his teammates shall be permitted to participate in a game.\\"Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See www.baseballexplained.com The freedom to wear high stirrups or not is remarkable considering how nowadays uniformity is otherwise enforced by MLB. For example, during a 2007 game against the Yankees, with the Yankees threatening to score, Red Sox manager Terry Francona was suddenly called away from the game and questioned by a league executive as to whether he was wearing the required uniform jersey beneath his blue pullover. He wasn‚Äôt pleased.Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See www.baseballexplained.com Although some teams ‚Äî particularly college teams ‚Äî continue to wear traditional baseball stirrup socks, another option has been to replace the stirrup/undersock with a \\"2 in 1\\" combination sock that mimics the real thing, or simply to wear a single solid knee-high sock with knickers. The trend back to knickers and high socks is particularly evident among youth and high-school teams. A few pro players, such as Taijuan Walker of the Arizona Diamondbacks, Derek Holland of the Texas Rangers, Melvin Upton, Jr. of the San Diego Padres, Bryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies, Casey Janssen of the Washington Nationals, Daniel Descalso of the St. Louis Cardinals, Josh Outman of the Cleveland Indians and Steve Cishek & Juan Pierre of the Miami Marlins, Chris Archer of the Tampa Bay Rays, J.R. Graham of the Minnesota Twins, Chris Taylor of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Francisco Lindor of the Cleveland Indians have been spotted wearing genuine stirrups recently to much fanfare. Several players on the Philadelphia Phillies will either wear stirrups over white sanitary socks, or over red socks, as the Phillies stirrups sport their Liberty Bell logo. The minor-league Springfield Cardinals wear a 2-in-1 version of the traditional St. Louis Cardinals' game sock that looks very much like the real thing. Other sports also use, or have used, stirrup socks, but traditionally wore a white sweat sock over, instead of under, the colored stirrup game sock (e.g. basketball, football, hockey). For many years American football officials commonly wore black baseball-style stirrups as part of their uniform (in some leagues by the 1980s, this would be replaced by one-piece stockings with the black/white stripes on the top half and a white bottom half) although this was done away with by the early 2010s as black full-length slacks replaced the traditional white knickers. There are still some sock companies manufacturing stirrup socks for baseball and other sports, including Twin City Knitting Company in Conover, North Carolina.

Today's Swiss Mennonite Conference can be traced to the Swiss Brethren. In 1525, Felix Manz, Conrad Grebel, George Blaurock and other radical evangelical reformers broke from Ulrich Zwingli and formed a new group because they felt reforms were not moving fast enough.William R. Estep, The Anabaptist Story (1996), pp. 37-43. Rejection of infant baptism was a distinguishing belief of the Swiss Brethren. On the basis of Sola scriptura doctrine, the Swiss Brethren declared that since the Bible does not mention infant baptism, it should not be practiced by the church. This belief was subsequently rejected by Ulrich Zwingli. Consequently, there was a public dispute, in which the council affirmed Zwingli's position. This solidified the Swiss Brethren and resulted in their persecution by all other reformers as well as the Catholic Church. Because of persecution by the authorities, many Swiss Brethren moved from Switzerland to neighboring countries. The Swiss Brethren became known as Mennonites after the division of 1693, a disagreement between groups led by Jacob Amman and Hans Reist. Many of the Mennonites in France, Southern Germany, the Netherlands and North America, as well as most Amish descend from the Swiss Brethren. Schleitheim Articles In 1527 Michael Sattler authored the Schleitheim Articles, the first Anabaptist confession of faith. It contained seven articles on the following topics: * Believer's baptism * Church discipline * Lord's Supper * Separation from the world and evil * Selection and role of pastors * Nonviolence (nonresistance) * Prohibition of oath-swearing Most Swiss Brethren accepted these seven articles. Key leaders Dissatisfaction with the outcome of a disputation in 1525 prompted a group to part ways with Huldrych Zwingli. George Blaurock (Bonaduz, c. 1491 ‚Äì 1529) was a co-founder of the Swiss Brethren movement. He was educated at the University of Leipzig and served as a priest, but departed from the Catholic Church before he arrived in Z√ºrich around 1524, for he had already taken a wife. Though he came to see Huldrych Zwingli, he soon became attached to the reformer's more radical followers. After a break with Zwingli in January 1525 and acting against a Z√ºrich city council ruling, Blaurock asked Conrad Grebel to baptize him upon a confession of faith in Christ. Grebel did so, and afterwards Blaurock proceeded to baptize the others who were present. Blaurock worked closely with Felix Manz until Manz was martyred in Z√ºrich in 1527. On that same day, Blaurock was severely beaten and permanently expelled from Z√ºrich. He kept moving, laboring at Bern, Biel, the Grisons, and Appenzell. After his arrest and fourth banishment in 1527, Blaurock left Switzerland never to return. He conducted a very successful ministry in Tyrol. In August 1529 he was arrested by Innsbruck authorities and tortured for information. On 6 September 1529, Blaurock was burned at the stake near Klausen. Conrad Grebel (c. 1498 ‚Äì 1526) was a co-founder of the Swiss Brethren movement. He was probably born in Gr√ºningen about 1498. His family moved to Z√ºrich around 1513. Grebel spent about six years in three universities, but without finishing his education or receiving a degree. In 1521 he joined a group gathered around Z√ºrich reformer Huldrych Zwingli to study the Greek classics, the Latin Bible, the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. Core members of the group broke with Zwingli because they thought the reform process was proceeding too slowly. At a gathering in January 1525 George Blaurock asked Grebel to baptize him upon a confession of faith. Afterward, Blaurock baptized Grebel and the others, initiating a wave of rebaptisms that would spread throughout the Swiss cantons. Grebel died of the plague in 1526. Margret Hottinger (before 1515 ‚Äì 30) was a charismatic and respected leader during the initial years of the movement. She joined early in 1525, at the time when George Blaurock evangelized and baptized in Zollikon. Her father and brothers were rebaptized early in 1525 also; Klaus Hottinger, an uncle, had been executed the previous year for his reformation activities. Hottinger was arrested along with other Anabaptist leaders including Blaurock, Grebel, Mantz, and Sattler in November of the same year. While Sattler and some others were released after swearing an oath promising to stop advocating rebaptism, Hottinger and the others refused and were imprisoned under harsh conditions. Hottinger relented after six months and signed a recantation, but before the year was out she was evangelizing in St. Gall. Hottinger and her family remained active in the area of Z√ºrich even after most other Anabaptists had fled to Moravia because of intense persecution. Finally they too set out for Moravia in 1530, but were captured en route near Waldsee. Hottinger was drowned because she refused to recant, her father Jakob was beheaded and her brother Felix was released because of his young age. Balthasar Hubmaier was the foremost theologian of the Swiss Brethren. Balthasar Hubmaier (c. 1480 ‚Äì 1528) was one of the most well-known and respected Anabaptist theologians of the Reformation. He was born in Friedberg, Bavaria around 1480. In 1524, he married Elizabeth H√ºgline of Reichenau. He attended Latin School at Augsburg, received both a bachelor's and a master's degree from the University of Freiburg in 1511 and a doctor's degree from the University of Ingolstadt under Johann Eck in 1512. After serving as the university's vice-rector, he left a pastorate of the Catholic Church at Regensburg in 1516 and then went to Waldshut in 1521. He was rebaptised there in 1525 by Wilhelm Reublin. He succeeded in establishing Anabaptism as the official religion for a short period first in Waldshut and then in Nikolsburg. On 10 March 1528 Hubmaier was executed by burning for heresy. Felix Manz (c. 1498 ‚Äì 1527) was a co-founder of the Swiss Brethren movement. Manz was the illegitimate son of a canon of the Grossm√ºnster in Z√ºrich. His knowledge of Hebrew, Greek and Latin indicate a liberal education. Manz became a follower of Huldrych Zwingli and when Conrad Grebel joined the group in 1521, he and Manz became friends. They questioned the mass, the nature of church and state connections, and infant baptism. The Z√ºrich city council declared Zwingli the victor of a January 1525 disputation and ordered the group to desist from arguing and submit to the decision of the council. Instead, the group gathered at the home of Felix Manz and his mother. Conrad Grebel rebaptized George Blaurock, and Blaurock in turn rebaptized the others. Manz proceeded to use his language skills to translate religious texts into the language of the people, and worked enthusiastically as an evangelist. Manz was arrested on a number of occasions between 1525 and 1527. While he preached with George Blaurock in the Gr√ºningen region, they were taken by surprise, arrested and imprisoned in Z√ºrich at the Wellenburg prison. The Z√ºrich council had passed an edict that made adult rebaptism punishable by drowning. On 5 January 1527, Felix Manz became the first casualty of the edict, and the first of the Swiss Brethren to be executed at the hands of Protestants. Hans Reist ( 1670 ‚Äì 1704) was a central figure in the dispute that resulted in the formation of the Amish branch. Reist favored a milder form of church discipline and was strongly opposed by Jakob Ammann who advocated a strict form of the ban. The disagreement was fierce and the ill feelings generated by the exchange between Reist, Ammann, and other leaders resulted in an unrepairable breach. Reist is recognized as a leader of the Swiss Brethren group that later adopted the name Mennonite. Felix Manz was executed by drowning within two years of his rebaptism. Wilhelm Reublin (1484 ‚Äì c. 1559) was a prolific Swiss Brethren missionary who eventually left the movement. Reublin was born in 1484 in Rottenburg am Neckar. In 1521, after studying theology in Freiburg and T√ºbingen, he pastored at St. Alban in Basel then in Witikon. Reublin was with Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz in Z√ºrich in January 1525 at the birth of the Anabaptist movement. Reublin took part in a disputation on 17 January 1525 after which Grebel, Mantz and Reublin were given eight days to leave the canton. Reublin proceeded to Hallau, where he establish a large Anaptist congregation. From Hallau Reublin successfully evangelized in other areas for the young Anabaptist movement. On Easter 1525 he baptized theologian Balthasar Hubmaier in Waldshut, where another center of the Anabaptism was developing. Michael Sattler was baptized by Reublin in Rottenburg. Other places evangelized by Reublin include Schaffhausen, Strasbourg, Reutlingen and Esslingen. By 1535 Reublin had left the Swiss Brethren. Michael Sattler (c. 1490 ‚Äì 1527) was particularly influential for his role in developing the Schleitheim Confession. Born in around 1490 in Staufen, Germany, Sattler became a Benedictine monk in the cloister of St. Peter and most likely became prior by the time he left, around 1525. He then married Margaretha, a former Beguine. That year they traveled to Z√ºrich, which was then embroiled in controversy over infant baptism, and was expelled from the city in November. He became associated with the Anabaptists and was probably rebaptised in the summer of 1526. He was involved in missionary activity around Horb and Rottenburg, and eventually traveled to Strasbourg. In February 1527 he chaired a meeting of the Swiss Brethren at Schleitheim, at which time the Schleitheim Confession was adopted. In May, 1527, Sattler was arrested by Roman Catholic authorities, along with his wife and several other Anabaptists. He was tried and sentenced to be executed as a heretic. Before execution by fire, his tongue was cut out, and red hot tongs were used to tear two pieces of flesh from his body. Margaretha was executed by drowning. Jakob Ammann ( 1696 ‚Äì before 1730) was an elder who became the founder of the Amish Mennonites. Ammann advocated the strictest form of the ban, insisting that there be no contact with an excommunicated member, even among family members. He had firm views on clothing style, opposed trimmed beards and introduced foot washing. He traveled among the Swiss Anabaptist communities in the Cantons of Switzerland, Alsace and the Palatinate promoting his views and excommunicating any who opposed him. Because of his unbending convictions and harsh rhetoric, an irreparable breach developed between the two groups that continues centuries later in North America. Ammann later regretted his contribution to the split and asked for forgiveness, but by 1700 the rift was too great. Early locations In Appenzell a congregation of 1500 formed soon after the movement was driven from Z√ºrich. Zwingli complained that the canton was too tolerant of Anabaptists. Increased enforcement of anti-Anabaptist decrees drove most congregations out by 1530, although some persisted into the 17th century.

It was based on the novel of the same name by Robert Cormier. Plot Barney Snow (Elijah Wood) wakes up in a hospital with no memory of why he is there. All he has is his name and some vague recollections of a car crash. He assumes that he is in the hospital for his amnesia and settles in to try to recover. He quickly realizes that all of the other residents of the youth clinic are all suffering from terminal illnesses. Another patient, Mazzo (Joseph Perrino), asks Barney to play host for his visiting twin sister Cassie (Rachael Leigh Cook). Barney immediately falls for Cassie and strives to get better, if only to be able to see her in a setting outside the hospital. He is determined to learn about his past so that he can make her a part of his future. In his explorations, both inside his shattered memories and through the physical rooms of the hospital, Barney starts to realize that there was no car crash. Doctor Harriman (Janeane Garofalo) induced amnesia in Barney to make him forget everything in his past. Barney demands to know why, and Harriman tells him he has cancer. The experimental procedure that Barney is undergoing is attempting to test the power of the mind in fighting cancer. Barney had volunteered for the treatment, hoping for a miracle cure. The theory was that if Barney didn‚Äôt know he had cancer, the body might stop creating the cancer cells. The explanation Harriman gives comes from an old myth that, based on weight ratios to wing power and wind resistance, the bumblebees should be aerodynamically incapable of flight ‚Äî yet the bumblebee doesn‚Äôt know that, so it flies anyway. Torn between his hope for a cure and his desire to continue his budding relationship with Cassie, Barney is forced to choose whether to go through the amnesia procedure again or remain with the memories and knowledge he has thus far acquired.

Antecedents The history of the Catholic Church in South Africa goes back to 1660, when a French bishop and a few priests were saved from the wreck of the Marichal near the Cape of Good Hope. They were only allowed to land, not to minister to the few Catholics who were already in Cape Town. Only in 1803 a Catholic priest was permitted to say Mass in the Cape Colony. Joannes Lansink, Jacobus Melissen and Lambertua Prinsen landed at Cape Town in 1803; the following year they were expelled. Pope Pius VII, by letters Apostolic dated 8 June 1818, appointed Edward Bede Slater the first vicar Apostolic of the Cape of Good Hope and the neighbouring islands, Mauritius included. Slater on his way to Mauritius in 1820, left Fr Scully at Cape Town in charge of the Catholics. In 1826 Theodore Wagner became resident priest. He was succeeded by E. Rishton in 1827. On 6 June 1837, Gregory XVI established the Vicariate of the Cape of Good Hope, separate from Mauritius, and from that time Cape Colony had its own bishops. History South Africa, comprising the country between Cape Agulhas and the tenth degree of south latitude and between the tenth and fortieth degrees of east longitude, was too much for one bishop. On 30 July 1847, Pius IX established a new vicariate in the eastern portion of Cape Colony. This new vicariate included first the eastern district of Cape Colony, Natal and the Orange Free State (Orange River Colony since the late South African war). The same pontiff on 15 November 1830 separated Natal and the Orange Free State from the Eastern Vicariate. The first bishop appointed by Rome to take charge of the Eastern Vicariate was Aidan Devereaux. He was consecrated bishop at Cape Town on 27 December 1847 by Griffith. When Pius IX erected the Vicariate of Natal, on 15 November 1830, the area of the new vicariate comprised all the portion of South Africa extending outside the then existing boundaries of Cape Colony. The first vicar Apostolic, Marie-Jean-Fran√ßois Allard , landed at Port Natal with five missionaries of the same French order. The name of this colony dates from Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese voyager, who sighted its headlands on Christmas Day, 1497, which suggested the name of Terra Natalis. In 1760 the Dutch had a trading settlement at the site of the present harbour of Durban, speedily abandoned; and more than a hundred years passed before Natal was again visited by Europeans. After several wars between Dutch, British and native (relatively recent Bantu and ancient Khoisan) peoples, Natal was declared a British colony in 1843. Nine years later, Allard and his five companions landed on the African shores. 'Til that time, no priest had been residing in Natal. The country had been occasionally visited by a priest from Cape Colony. The first missionary who ministered to the Catholics of Natal was Fr Murphy, sent by Devereaux. Its area was about 35,371 square miles (90,550 km¬≤), bounded on the north by Transvaal Colony and Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique); on the east by the Indian Ocean; on the south by Cape Colony (Pondoland); and on the west by Cape Colony (Griqualand East), Basutoland and Orange River Colony from which it is separated by the Drakensberg Mountains. At the advent of the first missionaries, the white element of the population was almost insignificant. Agriculture was practically unknown; industry, later a source of wealth, was altogether ignored. The Catholic population was then composed of about two hundred in Durban and three hundred in Pietermaritzburg; it comprised only white immigrants, from England and especially from Ireland. The native population, scattered all over Natal, Zululand and the Transkei, which districts formed also a portion of the Vicariate of Natal, was considered altogether uncivilised. The agents of the London Missionary Society had organised some missionary work for the civilisation of natives, but they came out rather as officials of the Government, and therefore were not altogether ready to go through the hardships of missionary life. Besides the Europeans and natives, there was the scattered Dutch - Protestant 'Boer'- population. Natives and Dutch were unwilling to convert to the Catholic faith. Among the former, superstitions, a morality which allowed polygamy, and among the latter, prejudices and hatred against the Church of Rome, for many years apparently rendered the efforts of the missionaries fruitless. However disheartened the pioneers remained at their post. For seven years they had not the consolation of registering one soul for the Catholic Church, yet the intrepid and courageous Allard wanted to push further his expeditions against paganism. He founded a new mission exclusively for the natives, to whom the missionaries wished to devote themselves altogether, and called that new mission St. Michael. Here they were destined to battle against many obstacles, privation of the necessaries of life, difficulty of communication and poverty, which drove the missionaries to the verge of starvation. The advent of new missionaries enabled Allard to found missions as far as Basutoland. Religious increase was slow, owing to the small number of missionaries and the degradation of the population. Communication was extremely slow and difficult, generally either by wagons drawn by oxen or on horseback; during the rainy season travel was very dangerous, owing to the swollen rivers. Amid such hardships and privations Allard felt that his life was drawing to a close. He retired to Rome, where he died soon after. Under his successor, Charles Jolivet , appointed 30 November 1874, the Vicariate of Natal made rapid progress in the way of Christianity and civilisation. New missions were founded all over this immense vicariate, and new chapels and schools for Europeans and natives were opened. Many obstacles which had hindered the missionary work badly were removed. Communication became easier, owing to the new railways and roads laid out across the country by the colonial Government of Natal. Missionary work has been of late years carried on amongst the natives on a very large scale, owing to the advent of some Trappists into the Colony of Natal, who afterwards were organised into the Congregation of the Missionaries of Mariannhill. They devoted themselves entirely to the evangelisation of the natives, and as statistics show, their efforts and labours were fully rewarded. The late Anglo-Boer war hampered much the missionary work in this vicariate, but the consequences of this war practically disappeared. Through the treaty agreed to by the British and the Boers, the Districts of Utrecht, Vryheid and Wakkerstroom were ceded to Natal and have been added to this vicariate, which since comprised the three above- mentioned districts, Natal proper, Transkei, Swaziland and Zululand. Henri Delalle was appointed bishop in 1904. The white population of the vicariate was estimated in 1910 to be about 100,000; natives, Indians and Malays, 1,000,000. The Catholic population was 25,737 (whites, 7458; natives, 15,227; coloured, 3052). Priests: Oblates of Mary Immaculate, 38; Missionaries of Mariannhill, 46; secular priests: Europeans, 4, natives, 3. There was a seminary, with eleven theological students. Lay brothers: Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Europeans, 4, native, 1; Missionaries of Mariannhill, 305; Marist Brothers, 7. Number of churches, 59; missions, 49. Number of schools: for whites, 24, pupils, 653; for natives, 62, pupils, 1864; for coloured, 10, pupils, 472; most schools were conducted by nuns.

Two schools for whites, 4 sanatoria for whites and natives, and an orphanage for coloured children under the management of the Augustinian Sisters; and a house for orphans and aged under the care of the Sisters of Nazareth House, with about 260 inmates. At the Bluff the Sisters of the Holy Family had an orphanage for European children; they had a novitiate at Bellair, with 10 novices. The Dominican Sisters had their mother-house at Oakford, and schools at Noodsberg, Genezzano, Dundee and Newcastle. At Ladysmith and Pietermaritzburg were two hospitals, and two sanatoria of the Augustinian Sisters. Besides numerous boarding-schools in different parts of the vicariate, there were many parochial schools, some under the control of the colonial Government, receiving a subsidy proportioned to the number of pupils. On 27 August 1921, part of its territory was split off and established as Apostolic Prefecture of Zululand, later to become the diocese of Eshowe; on 10 September 1921 another part was established as Apostolic Vicariate of Mariannhill, later further split. On 11 January 1951 the remaining territory was promoted as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Durban, with presently six Suffragan Dioceses: Dundee (Natal), Eshowe, Kokstad, Mariannhill, Umtata and Umzimkulu. In 1921 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manzini was split off, making Swaziland no longer under the jurisdiction of this diocese.

Fictional character biography Gustav Brandt German soldier Gustav Brandt served with the French forces during the Vietnam War. While in Saigon, he met and fell in love with a Vietnamese woman named Lua, and eventually had a daughter with her. However, Lua's brother Khruul was enraged with the interracial coupling of his sister and a European man. He and his men attacked Gustav and his family with flamethrowers. Lua was killed in the ensuing battle, and Gustav lost his eyesight. He and his daughter took shelter in Pama, where he was trained by the priests, but was forbidden to communicate with his daughter. Joining the Zodiac Cartel, Gustav adopted the codename Libra, and served as a terrorist. The Zodiac was infiltrated by Nick Fury, posing as Scorpio; the Zodiac fought the Avengers and escaped.Avengers #72 Led by Taurus, the Zodiac later attempted to kill all Manhattan residents born under the sign of Gemini as a show of power, but were thwarted by the Avengers. Taurus's faction attempted to kill the Zodiac dissident faction, but all twelve leaders were captured by the Avengers.Avengers #120‚Äì122 Battling the Avengers on several occasions, he eventually discovered that Mantis was the daughter he had left in Pama, and turned himself in to the authorities. He then vanished mysteriously, later turning up in Ho Chi Minh City, where the Swordsman revealed to everyone Mantis' transformation into the Celestial Madonna. Libra then witnessed the marriage of Mantis and the Swordsman, and returned to prison shortly after. He did not stay in prison long, though, as he escaped and committed illegal acts alongside the Zodiac once more. A new android version of the Zodiac later appeared, led by Scorpio in a new android body, massacred the human Zodiac, and took over their criminal operations.West Coast Avengers Vol. 2 #26 After the Zodiac's death at the hands of a Life Model Decoy, Libra ‚Äì now defining himself by his interest in the balance rather than continuing his criminal past ‚Äì served alongside the Avengers briefly as they battled Kang and Immortus in the Destiny War. His ability to sense the 'balance' of the universe helped Rick Jones use the Destiny Force to summon seven Avengers from different points in the team's history who would be crucial to their victory in the current crisis; these included Captain America from his battle with the Secret Empire, Yellowjacket while unbalanced and amnesic, Hawkeye just after the Kree-Skrull War, Giant-Man and Wasp of the present, Genis-Vell of a few months in the future, and Songbird from an alternate universe. Although they appeared strange choices, each Avenger was selected from these particular moments in time thanks to Libra's subconscious awareness of the universal balance and the necessity of their future actions even when he was unaware of their roles, comparing his subconscious decision to being able to balance on a tightrope without being able to explain how to do so. He realised the purpose behind their selection in the final confrontation, even acknowledging that Hawkeye's presence affected his own decisions as he decided to participate in the final fight rather than just watch from the sidelines.Avengers Forever #1-#12 Android Zodiac Scorpio (Jake Fury) constructed the android Zodiac members, although his plan was thwarted by the Defenders.Defenders #48‚Äì50 The androids Libra and Sagittarius employed costumed criminals posing as the Defenders to create chaos in New York City.Defenders #63‚Äì65 Quicksilver employed the android Zodiac to attack the West Coast Avengers, but the Avengers defeated the Zodiac.West Coast Avengers Annual #1 Led by Scorpio in a new android body, the android Zodiac massacred the human Zodiac, and took over their criminal operations.

Its codebase was originally taken from Ansgar Becker's own MySQL-Front 2.5 software. Due to having sold the MySQL-Front branding to an unrelated party, Becker chose \\"HeidiSQL\\" as a replacement. The name was suggested by a friend as a tribute to Heidi Klum, and was further reinforced by Becker's own nostalgia for Heidi, Girl of the Alps. A version written in Java, jHeidi, was designed to work on Mac and Linux computers. It was discontinued in March 2010 in favor of Wine support.  History  Ansgar Becker began development on a MySQL front-end in 1999 naming the project \\"MySQL-Front\\" and used a direct API layer written by Matthias Fichtner to interface with MySQL servers and contained databases. Private development continued until 2003 with version 2.5. In 2004, during a period of inactivity, Becker sold the MySQL-Front branding to Nils Hoyer, who continued development by cloning the original software. In April 2006, Becker open-sourced the application on SourceForge, renaming the project \\"HeidiSQL\\". HeidiSQL was re-engineered to use a newer and more popular database-interface layer, ZeosLib, which debuted in version 3.0. The database layer was again replaced by a single-unit approach in October 2009 by Becker. Later, this was again extended for supporting other database servers. Support for Microsoft SQL Server was added in March 2011 for the 7.0 release. Since the 8.0 release, HeidiSQL offers its GUI in about 22 languages other than English. Translations are contributed by users from various countries via Transifex. PostgreSQL support was introduced in March 2014 for the 9.0 release. In early 2018, a slightly extended v9.5 release was published on the Microsoft Store. SQLite support was introduced in March 2020 for the 11.0 release.

Biography Deverell was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, into an English family who moved back to Britain when Walter was only two years old. He studied art at the Royal Academy schools, where he met Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He and Rossetti shared a studio in 1851. The Pre-Raphaelites had been founded in 1848, and under Rossetti's influence Deverell's work began to show the influence of the movement, while still retaining features more characteristic of earlier genre painters like Charles Robert Leslie. It was Deverell who \\"discovered\\" Elizabeth Siddal, the Pre-Raphaelites' most important early model. However, despite his attraction to her, she later married Rossetti. Rossetti's assistant Henry Treffry Dunn was recommended for the position by Deverell. After the resignation of James Collinson from the PRB, Rossetti proposed that Deverell should replace him, but no decision was ever made. Deverell completed very few important works, exhibiting only four paintings at the R.A. before his early death from Bright's disease at the age of twenty-seven.

The church is located at the eastern side of Hohenzollernplatz square in the locality of Wilmersdorf, in Berlin's borough of Charlottenburg- Wilmersdorf. The building is considered one of the main pieces of Brick Expressionism.Sibylle Badst√ºbner-Gr√∂ger, Michael Boll√©, Ralph Paschke et al., Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkm√§ler / Georg Dehio: 22 vols., revis. and ext. new ed. by Dehio-Vereinigung, Berlin and Munich: Deutscher Kunstverlag, 22000, vol. 8: Berlin, p. 496. . And it is a testimonial of unique quality of expressionist church architecture in Berlin.Karin K√∂hler, Christhard-Georg Neubert and Dieter Wendland, Kirchen und Gottesh√§user in Berlin: Eine Auswahl, Berliner Arbeitskreis City-Kirchen (ed.), Berlin: Evangelische Kirche in Berlin-Brandenburg, 2000, p. 77. . The naming of the church after the square was originally a solution for the time being, until another name might be chosen. Meanwhile, the name has become a brand, even though the debate goes on. Church and architect Due to the high number of new parishioners moving in during the first third of the 20th century the existing three churches, to wit Auenkirche, High Master Church, and Church of the Cross, never sufficed to contain the congregants of the Evangelical Wilmersdorf Congregation (). In 1927 the then wealthy congregation, whose parish then comprised the locality of Wilmersdorf, therefore decided to build an additional church in the north of its parish.Karin K√∂hler, Christhard-Georg Neubert and Dieter Wendland, Kirchen und Gottesh√§user in Berlin: Eine Auswahl, Berliner Arbeitskreis City- Kirchen (ed.), Berlin: Evangelische Kirche in Berlin-Brandenburg, 2000, p. 76. . The congregation tendered a competition and the architecture firms of Otto Bartning, Hellmuth Grisebach, Fritz H√∂ger, Otto Kuhlmann , Leo Lottermoser and Hans Rottmayr handed in their projects. Bringing in the bells to the spire, accompanied by girls (traditionally virgins) in February 1932 H√∂ger prevailed with the design of the architect Ossip Klarwein, who started to work with H√∂ger by 1921, with the design altered by the latter. (), Sie legten den Grundstein. Leben und Wirken deutschsprachiger j√ºdischer Architekten in Pal√§stina 1918‚Äì1948, Berlin und T√ºbingen: Wasmuth, 1996, p. 294. Klarwein was chief designer (Cf. Ernst-Erik Pfannschmidt, another architect employed with H√∂ger, in his Letter to Eckhardt Berckenhagen, 29 June 1977, who then prepared the exhibition on the occasion of H√∂ger's 100th anniversary in the Kunstbibliothek Berlin, an institution of the Berlin State Museums of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.) in H√∂ger's firm and ‚Äì according to his contract ‚Äì all his designs were issued under H√∂ger's name. The congregation commissioned the Hamburg-based architecture firm of H√∂ger. So Klarwein moved to Joachim-Friedrich-Stra√üe No. 47 (Berlin), shortly before the constructions started, in order to supervise the realisation of the design. The construction lasted from 1930 to 1933.G√ºnther K√ºhne and Elisabeth Stephani, Evangelische Kirchen in Berlin (11978), Berlin: CZV-Verlag, 21986, p. 310. . On 19 March 1933 the church was inaugurated, soon after Klarwein, his wife and son Mati emigrated to Mandatory Palestine, because of the Nazi takeover (Machtergreifung). The design of the church The modern design was much under debate already long before the constructions started.See the number of articles in architectural reviews, from 1928 on, in: Entry in Berlin's list of monuments with further sources . The basic structure of the church is a concrete skeleton, clad by the fa√ßades, finely structured on the long sides and of even masonry on the narrow sides, all in clinker brick. H√∂ger preferred that material. The hip roof of verdigris copper contrasts with the dark reddish brick. The slim and high tower, being a landmark seen through much of Hohenzollerndamm thoroughfare and other streets, is connected to the northeastern corner of the actual building. Decoration around the western main portal. The actual prayer hall is elevated, because the ground floor harbours a fellowship hall. The entrance at the western side is flanked both sides by the cladding of the two round staircases. A semicircular flight of stairs leads to the ogival main portal, which announces the dominant forms of the interior. The complete appearance is a good eye-catching flank to the eastern side of the square of Hohenzollernplatz. The interior of the huge nave is structured by 13 girders of ferroconcrete, which end as pilasters on the ground. Starting from the entrance in the west the girders give the impression to taper towards the east. The ogival form of the girders grants the interior a kind of Gothic, very modern though, appeal. This form evoked certain mysticism, which is unusual for the rather sober Protestant church architecture of those years. This and the modern as well as voluminous appearance earned the church the nickname Powerhouse of God (). The Allied bombing of Berlin in World War II inflicted severe damage on the church. On 22 November 1943 the church burnt out. The reconstruction proceeded gradually until 1965. Services were then held in the fellowship hall below the actual prayer hall. The architect Gerhard Schlotter submitted the church to a renovation and rebuild in 1990/1991, in order also to prepare it for its usage for exhibitions of contemporary art. Schlotter brightened up the prayer hall in the colours used before the destruction. Furnishings Prof. Hermann Sandkuhl created sgraffiti, displaying different figures in the intermediate spaces between the pilasters, all lost in the fire in 1943.G√ºnther K√ºhne and Elisabeth Stephani, Evangelische Kirchen in Berlin (11978), Berlin: CZV- Verlag, 21986, p. 312. . The tympanon of the last, somewhat smaller girder, opening towards the oriented quire, showed a painting of the Sermon on the Mount, depicting Jesus of Nazareth with a corona of light by Erich Waske , which was also lost in 1943. The prayer hall is illuminated by three long windows in the quire. The original windows were blasted away by the bombs. In 1962 Sigmund Hahn designed a new central quire window. In the course of the renovation of 1990/1991 Achim Freyer added a new right and left colourful quire window.Karin K√∂hler, Christhard-Georg Neubert and Dieter Wendland, Kirchen und Gottesh√§user in Berlin: Eine Auswahl, Berliner Arbeitskreis City- Kirchen (ed.), Berlin: Evangelische Kirche in Berlin-Brandenburg, 2000, p. 78. . H√∂ger's Baptismal font of clinker brick with gold paintings on it survived. Regina Roskoden's abstract basalt sculpture of an angel, graphics by Max Pechstein and a painting of the crucifixion by Hermann Krauth are shown in a by-room. Considerable offertories of the parishioners enabled to buy a new organ of 60 registers by E. Kemper & Sohn, installed after 1965 and requiring the removal of the second western loft gallery of seats. Congregation today On 1 April 1946 the northern part of the parish of the Wilmersdorf Congregation was constituted as today's Congregation at Hohenzollernplatz (), becoming the proprietor of the ruined church. Since 1987 the church is also open for exhibitions of contemporary art, two of which are shown every year. Art plays an important role for the congregation, thus there are also services referring to art. In 1991 the organ builder Sauer reintonated the Kemper organ, which is regularly used in the services and for concerts. Since November 2008 every Saturday at 12.00 the \\"NoonSong\\" ‚Äì a 30 minutes lasting liturgy sung by the professional vocal ensemble sirventes berlin ‚Äì attracts hundreds of listeners. Trivia The church is nicknamed \\"God's power house\\" (\\"Kraftwerk Gottes\\") by the Berlin inhabitants due to its appearance.

Life and career Personal life Salmoni's mother, a competitive figure skating coach, and father, a chemical Scientist, fostered his love for the wild. Salmoni studied zoology at the Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, and wrote his undergraduate thesis on tracking the hibernation of Alaskan black bears. Also while in university, Salmoni was certified in Biological Immobilization of Wildlife and worked on an elk relocation project and at a pigdeer count station for the Ministry of Natural Resources. Salmoni is very private about his personal life, but has stated that he got engaged and was expecting his first child with his fianc√©e in 2015.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4JAJx2cXCE His son Thomas was born in August 2015.http://twitter.com/davesalmoni/status/649927503327461379?lang=tr Animal training In 1998, Salmoni began his apprenticeship as an animal trainer at Bowmanville Zoological Park. Salmoni left Canada for South Africa in 2000 as part of the controversial Tiger \\"rewilding\\" project. Salmoni was attacked by one of his trained big cats named Bongo, a five hundred pound male African lion in August 1999 in Ontario, which inspired his making of After the Attack. Television He has hosted and produced several television documentaries, including Living with Tigers, which describes the progress he and John Varty made as part of a controversial Bengal Tiger rewilding project, Into the Lion's Den and Sharks: Are They Hunting Us?, both for Discovery Channel. He starred in the show Animal Face-Off as a host and expert. He currently hosts and produces the Discovery Channel show Rogue Nature, as well as After the Attack and Into the Pride on Animal Planet. Salmoni has been criticized by credentialed research biologists for his theatrics in an effort to make more entertaining television at the expense of wild lions and tigers. His antics have drawn much concern from the scientific community including the leading big cat conservationists affiliated with notable organizations like Panthera Corporation and the Wildlife Conservation Society. There is much sentiment that he is impeding conservation efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and conveys the wrong message about the human-cat interface to viewers in regard to safety, animal behavior and conservation. Programmes that have attracted such criticism include Living with Tigers and Into the Pride, with Elsie Cloete of the University of the Witwatersrand writing about the latter, \\"animals quickly became commodities designed to enhance the representation of the human presenter-host\\". Salmoni started production of a short series named Deadly Islands which premiered in 2014. This series consisted of Salmoni visiting some of the world's most remote islands where he would live side by side with some of the fiercest predators on the planet. During the short series he investigates how the inhabitants of these islands have lived so well and strived to survive despite of the very harsh conditions. He visits places such as the famous Bear Island, Shark Island and Devil's Island, risking his own safety and even putting himself up as bait in one episode. He also hosted Expedition Impossible, a Mark Burnett show on ABC in 2011. TV Shows Salmoni appears in the following TV shows: Jimmy Kimmel Live!

The accident happened en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, during the third leg of a four-leg journey. All 50 people on board were killed in the worst-ever accident involving the Boeing 377. The investigation took place under exceptionally unfavorable conditions, and the exact cause of the crash was not established. However, it was theorized based on an examination of the wreckage that an engine had separated in flight after propeller blade failure. Aircraft The Boeing 377 Stratocruiser registration N1039V, christened \\"Clipper Good Hope\\", made its first flight on September 28, 1949. At the time of the accident it had accumulated a total of 6944 airframe hours in flight. It was equipped with four 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial piston engines, each with a Hamilton Standard Model 24260 four-blade propeller.

It was cleared to fly an off-airways route directly to Port of Spain, which took it over the dense forests of the Amazon jungle that were still unexplored at the time. The flight reported abeam the city of Barreiras in eastern Brazil at 6:16 a.m. local time (09:16 UTC), flying at 14,500 feet under VFR conditions; the pilots estimated that the next position report would be at 7:45 a.m. (10:45 UTC), abeam the city of Carolina in the northeastern state of Maranh√£o, Brazil. This was the last known message from the flight. Witnesses in the villages of Formosa and S√£o Francisco reported seeing the aircraft overhead at about the time it reported abeam Barreiras; they described the aircraft as operating normally. When the aircraft failed to report abeam Carolina and then abeam the city of Santar√©m in northern Brazil, local authorities initiated a missing aircraft alert.  Search and discovery  Brazilian Air Force, USAF, and US Navy aircraft searched the jungle, while Brazilian Navy ships searched the coastal areas off northern South America. The wreckage was not found until May 1, when a Pan Am Curtiss Commando freighter reported finding it in Caraja Indian territory southwest of Carolina. \\"The burned, broken wreckage of the Pan American Stratocruiser that vanished Monday night was found in northern Brazil today.\\" There was no evidence that any of the 50 persons on board, including 19 Americans, lived through the crash. An air hunt over of jungle, river basins and plateau land finally located the ruins in the Indian country between the cities of Barreiras and Carolina. Airline officials said the find had been made by a C-46 Pan American cargo plane piloted by Capt. Jim Kowing of Miami. The scene is about southwest of Carolina, a Tocantins River town north- northwest of Rio de Janeiro. The double-decked Stratocruiser was reported to have broken in two; its charred wreckage was scattered on both sides of a high hill. Pan American officials said a Panair do Brasil airliner circled the scene of the crash; its pilot reported extensive evidence of fire and said he saw two of the big plane's engines lying apart in the hilly, heavily wooded area. A Pan American passenger plane was converted to carry a seven-man rescue unit, headed by Maj. Richard Olney of the United States Air Force base at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Maj. Oliver Seaman, an Air Force flight surgeon. Pan American's office at Miami reported that, after circling the scene for four hours, the rescue plane returned to its base at Para without dropping the rescue team. It said they did not jump because there were no signs of survivors.  Investigation  Later, a 27-man investigation team flew via seaplane to Lago Grande, a tiny Indian village on the Araguaia River less than from the wreckage, with the intention of trekking to the accident site. Unfortunately, the extreme nature of the terrain forced all but seven team members to return to Lago Grande before reaching the site. The remaining seven investigators, running short of water, food and other supplies, were only able to confirm that all on board had died on impact and that a huge fire had consumed the fuselage. A properly equipped and provisioned second investigation team built a base camp northwest of Lago Grande and finally reached the wreckage on August 15. They determined that the wreckage had fallen to the ground in three main sections. Most of the wreckage, including the fuselage, the starboard or right wing, the root of the port or left wing (including the nacelle for the No. 2 engine but not the engine itself), and the Nos. 3 and 4 engines (normally attached to the starboard wing) had fallen in an area of dense forest about northwest of the base camp. The outer port wing and the No. 1 engine had fallen to the northwest of the main wreckage; the empennage and fractured parts of the No. 2 engine (normally attached to the port wing) had fallen roughly north of the main wreckage and northeast of the port wing. Although the No. 2 engine and its propeller were not found, evidence on the port wing root, the No. 2 engine nacelle, the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer, and the horizontal stabilizer led investigators to believe that the engine and/or propeller had failed in flight. There had been two prior engine separation incidents with the 377, on January 24 and 25, 1950. In this case, investigators hypothesized that the propeller failure caused the engine to experience highly unbalanced loads and it eventually separated from the aircraft, precipitating an in-flight breakup. Debris from the propeller and engine may have contributed to the breakup by damaging control surfaces after being flung from the port wing during the failure.

He spent the first five years of his career with the Lions before signing with the Blue Bombers for the 2010 CFL season. During the 2013 CFL season, he rejoined the Lions when the Blue Bombers traded him for Akeem Foster. He played in two Grey Cup games, winning a championship in 2006. He played college football at New Mexico State from 2001‚Äì2004, starting at quarterback for most of his senior year. High school The son of Tim and Connie Pierce, he attended Del Norte High School, in Crescent City, California. He was a three-year starter at Del Norte, guiding the Warriors to a 16-4 record as a junior and senior. He passed for 2,225 yards and 25 touchdowns as a senior in 1999, earning Big 5 Conference Most Valuable Player honors for the second consecutive season. He broke the school's single-season and career records for both passing yardage and passing touchdowns in 1999. Buck threw for 2,010 yards and 19 touchdowns as a junior in 1998 and 1,180 yards and 10 touchdowns as a sophomore in 1997. He was voted to the Times Standard North Coast California All-Century team. He qualified for North State meet as a long jumper, leaping better than 22 feet as a junior. He also led DNHS to a pair of league titles as a starting guard on the basketball squad. College career Pierce attended New Mexico State University, in Las Cruces, New Mexico where he majored in kinesiology. In 2001, on his first run from scrimmage as a college player, Pierce ripped off a 75-yard run against Louisville. He did not throw an interception in 2001 and did not throw one in 2002 until the fourth quarter against North Texas (11/16) in the next to last game of the season. Wearing the #11 jersey, he started seven games as a sophomore, and took the top job in 2004 as a senior. He consistently posted high efficiency ratings as a college quarterback. Professional career BC Lions Pierce signed a free agent contract with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League on May 16, 2005 after being passed over by the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Pierce began the season as the third-string quarterback, making his CFL debut on Aug 19, 2005 versus Hamilton. In this game, he completed all three of his passes and also threw his first CFL touchdown pass, to running back Antonio Warren, in a 39-15 win over the Tiger- Cats. After injuries to starter Dave Dickenson and backup Casey Printers, Pierce earned his first career start in Week 16 at Winnipeg (Oct 10/05), a 44-23 loss, completing 12-of-22 passes for 133 yards. After Casey Printers left for the NFL in 2006, Pierce was elevated to the backup quarterback position behind Dave Dickenson. Once Dickenson was injured in week 8 against the Edmonton Eskimos, Buck was again elevated to starter status, this time for two straight games and earned his first CFL win as a starter as the team won both games. Dickenson returned only to leave the Sept 24 game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders with post-concussion symptoms, leaving Pierce to start the next game against the Tiger-Cats, also a win. He started each of the next three games until playing poorly in the third game against Hamilton where Dickenson reclaimed his starter's position. Pierce went 5-1 as a starter as he led the CFL in completion percentage (73.7%) and had the second highest quarterback rating (109.0).. At the conclusion of the season, Pierce shared in the Lions championship, playing for a few snaps in the 94th Grey Cup. In 2007, then-starter Dave Dickenson suffered yet another concussion, in week 3, and Pierce stepped up to assume the role of starting quarterback. By mid-August, Pierce was hobbled by injuries to his ribs, toe, hand, and shoulder, but he persevered in the starting role until finally relinquishing the role to third- stringer Jarious Jackson, who performed well himself. The Lions finished a team record 14-3-1, but succumbed to the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the West Final. Due to his frequent injuries, Pierce has been referred to as the Lions' \\"walking bruise\\". As of the end of 2007, he had started 11 games as a Lion, compiling a mark of 7-3-1. With Dave Dickenson being released in the off- season, the starting quarterback's position was up for grabs for the 2008 season. Following the 2008 pre-season and a tough competition with back-up Jarious Jackson, Pierce was named the BC Lions starting quarterback. Because of an injury in the regular season opener, he acted as the back-up until Jackson's ineffective play led to Pierce returning as the starter against Montreal on Labour Day Weekend. After manhandling the Roughriders in the West Semi-Final, he led the Lions to the West Final against Calgary where they were defeated for the fourth time that season. The 2009 season saw Pierce struggle with concussions and shoulder injuries. He was sidelined with the former in week 7 on August 14 in a game against Toronto. He returned to play for the first time in week 12 on September 19, starting again against Toronto, after Jarious Jackson was injured in the previous game against Montreal. But again, Pierce was besieged with injuries and left the week 16 match-up with Winnipeg, leaving third stringer Travis Lulay to carry out a victory. With Jackson sitting out the rest of the season, head coach Wally Buono opted to sign former CFL MOP Casey Printers. In the Winnipeg game, Lulay had also injured himself towards the end of the game, forcing Buono to start Printers for the final three games of the regular season. When Printers was knocked out of the finale against Edmonton on November 6, Pierce came in, in relief, and was again knocked out with a shoulder injury. At season end Buono stated that not all five quarterbacks would be back in 2010. On March 9, 2010, Buck Pierce was released by the BC Lions making him a free agent. Winnipeg Blue Bombers Pierce signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League on April 12, 2010. He started Winnipeg's opening game of the 2010 CFL season against Hamilton on July 2, 2010. Pierce fought through an injury-plagued season, making only five starts with only three of those coming consecutively. Despite backup Steven Jyles playing well in his absence, the Blue Bombers showed their confidence in his progress in the off-season by trading Jyles to the Toronto Argonauts in May 2011, leaving Pierce the undisputed starter.https://www.cfl.ca/article/jumping-ship-argos-get-jyles-from-bombers Jumping ship: Argos get Jyles from Bombers The 2011 Winnipeg Blue Bombers season began with significant optimism as the team hoped to make the playoffs after failing to qualify the last two seasons. One of the major questions regarding the teams potential was the health of their starting quarterback Buck Pierce, who had missed 13 games the previous year due to injury. Throughout the season Buck Pierce's health would prove to be a minor concern despite taking some viscous hits by defenders. The Blue Bombers jumped out to a 7-1 record to start the season, leading the Eastern Conference. After Labour Day Weekend the Bombers began to struggle losing 6 of 9 games entering the final game of the season with a record of 10-7. Statistically Pierce did not have a great season, but he proved that he was a sufficiently healthy quarterback who could win games. The 2012 Winnipeg Blue Bombers season began with a great deal of optimism following the teams trip to the 99th Grey Cup in the previous season. Pierce sustained a leg injury in July which caused him to miss multiple games. In only his second game (Sep 29, 2012) back from injury Pierce took a violent hit to his head, from which he received a concussion. By the conclusion of the season Pierce had only played in 7 of the 18 regular season games. The Blue Bombers finished the year 6-12 and missed the playoffs. Heading into the 2013 season the Bombers released Joey Elliott and Alex Brink leaving Pierce as the only QB on the roster with any CFL experience. After Week 5, Pierce lost his starting job to Justin Goltz, and fell to No.3 in the depth chart behind Max Hall. Return to BC With the rise of young quarterbacks, Justin Goltz and Max Hall in Winnipeg, Joey Elliott being released in BC, and Pierce's inability to stay healthy, he was traded to BC on September 8, 2013 for non-import receiver Akeem Foster. He played in five games for the Lions and started their last regular season game of 2013. Following a nine-year career, Pierce announced his retirement on March 4, 2014.  Coaching career  On March 7, 2014, only three days after announcing his retirement, Pierce was announced as the running backs coach for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Pierce played 4 seasons with the Bombers from 2010 through 2013. Personal life Pierce and his wife live in Winnipeg, where he once owned a barbeque restaurant which closed in 2015. They have a daughter born in 2015.

He then pursued his graduate studies in Paris for three years, during which time he married Lilly Carandino. Upon his return to Romania, he was editor in chief of Facla (a left-wing publication run by N. D. Cocea), and a collaborator or editor at various other publications, including Credin≈£a, Reporter, Azi, Floarea de Foc. Between 1938 and 1944, he served as Vice-President of the Journalists' Union. During World War II, soon after the Legionnaires' Rebellion, Carandino became director of the National Theatre Bucharest, replacing Haig Acterian (who had been arrested for his Iron Guard membership). Because of his opposition to the authoritarian regime of Ion Antonescu, he was imprisoned in 1942 in a penitentiary camp near T√¢rgu Jiu. A member of the National Peasants' Party, he was, from 1944 to 1947, the editor of its newspaper, Dreptatea. During the period, he was also appointed by his political grouping to the board of the new Journalists' Union, and became a member of a committee charged with purging supporters of former far right regimes from the press (the committee was dominated by Romanian Communist Party members, and presided over by Emil Socor).Diac Carandino was one of the four politicians who were part of the National Peasants' Party leadership designated by party leader Iuliu Maniu to leave the country and create a credible and competent nucleus of Romanian anti-Communist resistance in the West, a move which resulted in the TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair and their arrest on the morning of July 14, 1947. Of the defendants tried alongside Maniu, he was the last survivor. After this trial, he was sentenced to six years' hard labour and two years' loss of civil rights, his property was confiscated and he had to pay 1,000 lei in court fees. After the Romanian Revolution against the communist regime, when Dreptatea resumed publication in 1990, he became its honorary director. That year, he was also made honorary member of the revived National Peasants' Party. Carandino, who was a gifted columnist, relates an interesting anecdote in his memoirs: a young man reproached Carandino for not helping him; he replied: \\"I can help someone, but I can't replace him.\\" He added, \\"I'm an old man now; going down the road of life I can see the end. When I turn back and look, I wonder why, if my own future is brief, others aren't coming up the road? Where are those who ought to be coming?\\" He died at Hospital nr. 10 \\"Sf. Sava\\" in Bucharest. After a service at Boteanu Church, he was buried in StrƒÉule≈üti Cemetery on February 21, 1996.

The upper Touchet was a traditional summer meeting place for trade and games for the Palus, Nez Perce and Walla Walla tribes. The name Touchet derives from the similarly pronounced Sahaptin term for the river, Tu-se meaning roasting. Nez Perce legend tells that coyote roasted salmon at this river after breaking a fish dam guarded by the seven swallow sisters at Celilo. The USGS cited two variant names, Pouchet River and Toosha River. Geography The Touchet River drains an area of about .Washington Road & Recreation Atlas, Benchmark Maps, Medford, Oregon, 2002 The main stem is long. The average annual flow of the Touchet is 6.23 m¬≥/s (220 ft¬≥/s), not including diversions.Records of the POLLUTION CONTROL HEARINGS BOARD, State of Washington Its headwaters lie in the Umatilla National Forest which is located in the Blue Mountains in Columbia County, southern Washington. It originates above the town of Dayton, Washington. It then passes through Waitsburg and Prescott before joining the Walla Walla at the town of Touchet, Washington. The main Touchet River is formed by the confluence of the North Fork of the Touchet which originates in the vicinity of the Bluewood Ski Area, and the South Fork of the Touchet which originates at Deadman Peak. The forks join about south of (upstream of) Dayton. The North Fork is about long and the South Fork about long. Other tributaries include Patit Creek, which joins the Touchet at Dayton; Coppei Creek, which enters at Waitsburg, and Whetstone Creek, which joins the Touchet at Prescott. Recreation The Touchet is known for its rainbow and cutthroat trout fishing, especially in the upper and middle reaches. Summer steelhead, which like salmon are anadromous, and Chinook salmon spawn throughout a large portion of the middle and upper reaches of the Touchet River drainage, the population is imperiled in the 21st century. The Nine Mile Dam, constructed in 1905 on the Walla Walla River below the confluence with the Touchet River, impeded anadromous fish migration into the Touchet, but a wild steelhead population (listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act) continues to return to the river. History Native peoples Touchet River Valley in the fall, slightly west of Lamar Cabin. The Touchet River lay in the traditional range of the Palus American Indian tribe, marking their southern border with the range of the Walla Walla tribe. These peoples were of the Sahaptin-speaking group which traditionally inhabited the Columbia Plateau region of the northwestern United States. Roots provided plentiful food along the Touchet Rivers. These included quamash, camas, kouse, bitterroots, serviceberry (currant), chokecherry, huckleberry, gooseberries, rose berries and whortleberries, elderberries, wild strawberries, wild onions and balsamroot. Once Euroamerican immigrants began settling the area after 1858, Indian root grounds were displaced by agriculture. Prior to the white man coming into the valley of the Touchet River, there was an established American Indian trail through the valley, the Nez Perce Trail to Celilo Falls or Old Celilo Falls Trail, by which the Nez Perce (also part of the Sahaptin-speaking group) passed west to fish for salmon at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River. As with other Sahaptin-speaking peoples, the Nez Perce were migratory, returning to the same locations year after year; Celilo Falls lay at the western end of their annual range. Lewis and Clark expedition On their return journey in 1806, the Lewis and Clark Expedition followed the Old Celilo Falls Trail, up the Walla Walla and Touchet River Valleys; they camped on the Touchet about north of today's town of Touchet on April 30, 1806.Lewis & Clark on April 30, 1806 The Lewis and Clark Trail State Park commemorates their May 1, 1806 campsite on the Touchet River. The expedition left the Touchet River to follow a tributary, Patit Creek, at what is now Dayton. They camped about above modern-day Dayton on Patit Creek on May 2, 1806, before following the trail across country to the Tucannon River. Early settlement The Whitman Mission catalyzed white settlement of the region, beginning in 1843 when 1,000 people, 120 wagons, and approximately 5,000 horses and cattle came to the Walla Walla valley. The initial settlers remained near the current city of Walla Walla and into the Touchet River valley. Later settlement Lamar Cabin The Lamar Cabin, built in 1863 of hand-hewn cottonwood logs from the Touchet River valley by George Dudley Goodwin, became the home of the bachelor brothers James and Joseph Lamar in 1872 (women were rare in the valley and many men remained unmarried). The brothers initially raised sheep and horses; in later years they, mirroring the transitions of many others in the region, cultivated dryland winter wheat. This area developed into the town of Lamar when the Hunt Railroad was built along the Touchet River valley in 1888. The railway left the Touchet River and continued west at Lamar at the point where the Touchet River turns south to meet the Walla Walla. Although the town site is now virtually abandoned, the historic Lamar cabin is preserved to this day (see photo). Near the head of the Touchet valley, Dayton was officially incorporated on November 10, 1881.

Varty is also leading a controversial project which aims to create a free-ranging, self-sustaining tiger population outside of Asia. Early life John Varty attended Parktown Boys' High School in Johannesburg. As a child, John learned about huntinghttp://www.kalahari.com/books/Nine-lives/68158/37881750.aspx on the family game farm near the Kruger National Park. After his father, Charles, died, John and his brother, Dave Varty, terminated the hunting activities and converted it into a game reserve in 1973. They renamed it Londolozi, which is the Zulu word for \\"protector of living things\\". Since then it has become one of the top resorts in the world and was included in Travel and Leisure's world's best 4 times in the late 90s and early 2000s.

In 1992, he wrote, produced and starred in Running Wild, a feature film starring Brooke Shields. Tiger re-wilding project In 2000, John started a Bengal tiger re-wilding project near Philippolis in the Free State.Tiger man of Africa Starting with captive bred tigers, the aim is to establish a wild tiger population outside of Asia. In 2003, the progress was documented in a The Discovery Channel production called Living with Tigers. In 2011, National Geographic made a second documentary called Tiger Man of Africa. The project was the subject of controversy after accusations by investors and conservationists of manipulating the behaviour of the tigers for the purpose of the production of the film Living with Tigers, with the tigers believed to be unable to hunt. Stuart Bray, who had originally invested a large sum of money in the project, claimed that he and his wife, Li Quan, watched the film crew \\"[chase] the prey up against the fence and into the path of the tigers just for the sake of dramatic footage.\\" Quan and Bray also accused them of financial mismanagement after a legal audit uncovered that he had borrowed R5.7-million of the funds for extraneous and personal expenses. Quan and Bray subsequently established the Save China's Tigers Laohu Valley Reserve, also near Philippolis. Moreover, scientists have also established that the tigers are not genetically pure, which would imply that the project has no conservation value.Arrick, A., Mckinney, K. (2007) Purrrfect Breed? TylerPaper.com, 13 August 2007 online On 29 March 2012 John Varty was critically injured when one of his tigers attacked him on his farm near Philippolis.

Its mission is to assist in establishing and maintaining naval ability of the United States through testing, evaluation, and underwater research. General information The sophisticated facility includes three test ranges ‚Äî the Weapons Range, the Acoustic Range, and the FORACS Range ‚Äî all located in the Tongue of the ocean (TOTO), a deep-ocean basin approximately long by wide, with depths as great as . The main AUTEC support base and downrange tracking stations are on Andros Island in the Bahamas, just west of Nassau and about southeast of West Palm Beach, Florida. On January 23, 2020, the corporation PAE Applied Technologies received roughly $32.9 million for six more months of facility and range maintenance and range operations support services at AUTEC. On August 12, 2020, the corporation Amentum (created in January 2020 when AECOM sold its management services business to American Securities LLC and affiliates of the private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg) received roughly $430 million for five years' worth of operation and maintenance of AUTEC. Deep water range The deep water Weapons Range lies roughly parallel to the east coast of Andros Island. It is the largest and most versatile of the AUTEC ranges, and it is capable of tracking up to 63 in- water objects simultaneously. The range is supported by the Main Base (Site 1) and various smaller sites located to the south along the east coast of Andros Island. AN/WQC-2A Sonar Communications Sets and Bi-Directional Communications Nodes provide underwater voice communications for mobile target and emergency command signal coverage, while HF, UHF, and VHF radio communications are available over the entire range. In-air tracking In-air tracking is provided by radars and various other in-air tracking systems such as LATR, the Hyperbolic In-Air Tracking System (HITS), and Differential GPS (DGPS). These in-air systems cover the AUTEC Weapons Range up to a distance of from Site 1 and a height of 70,000 feet (21,000 m). Surveillance radars operate to support air and surface safety. In-water tracking The in-water portion of the Weapons Range covers 500 square nautical miles (1,700 km¬≤). This range can be divided into two distinct tracking areas consisting of roughly 250 square nautical miles (850 km¬≤). This flexibility allows for the unique operation of two distinct individual exercises. Use of the total range is referred to as \\"Weapons Range\\", while dividing the range into two distinct portions, the northern section is referred to as \\"Weapons Range North\\", whereas the southern portion is called \\"Weapons Range South\\". Electronic Warfare Threat Simulator Electronic Warfare Threat Simulator (EWTS) is a real-time system that can generate complex, dynamic, electromagnetic signal environments at the radio frequency (RF) level. With this system, AUTEC offers capabilities to test different platform receivers in an open-air, over-the-water range. The system consists of a radar simulator, pedestal and controller, antennas, high- power amplifiers, calibration equipment, and an operator workstation. The system is housed in an air-conditioned radome and located on a tower. Tasks The typical task performed at AUTEC is testing and certifying the proficiency of U.S. Navy submarine captains and their crews, as well as the accuracy of their undersea weapons. Brief history of AUTEC During the 1940s and 1950s, the U.S. Navy's need for a deep water test facility became so apparent that in 1958 the Chief of Naval Operations established an advisory group to determine the location and specifications for testing underwater vehicles, weapons, and weapon systems. As a result of the extensive studies of this group, the United States Secretary of the Navy in November 1959 directed establishment of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) under the Bureau of Ships (now Naval Sea Systems Command) to provide a deep water test and evaluation facility for making underwater acoustic measurement, testing sonar, and providing accurate underwater, surface and air tracking data on ships and weapons in support of the U.S. Navy's antisubmarine and undersea research and development programs. The area chosen for AUTEC was the Tongue of the Ocean (TOTO) located between the islands of Andros, New Providence, and Exuma Sound in the Bahamas. Chosen because of its ideal natural characteristics, and its climate which permits year-round operations, the TOTO is a U-shaped, relatively flat-bottomed trench approximately wide by long with a depth which varies gradually from in the south to in the north. Its only exposure to the open ocean is at the northern end, and except for this ocean opening, the TOTO is surrounded by numerous islands, reefs, and shoals which make a peripheral shelter isolating it from ocean disturbances, particularly high ambient noise which degrades undersea tests and evaluations. A joint United States/United Kingdom Agreement signed in 1963 with the concurrence of the Bahamian Government, enabled the United States to develop this area of water and certain territory on the east coast of Andros Island, readily accessible to the TOTO, and there install equipment to build three offshore test ranges. Under this agreement, the Royal Navy has equal access to the test facility. Construction of the Navy's Main Base and the downrange tracking sites on Andros Island began in March 1964, and the initial cadre of officers and men arrived by U.S. Navy LST in August 1965. In October of that year, Commander G. P Barney arrived as the first permanent Officer-in-charge, Andros Ranges, and the official dedication of AUTEC was held on 14 April 1966. The complex electronics installation was accomplished from fall of 1965 to fall of 1966, and in September 1966 RCA Service Company was awarded the Maintenance and Operations Contract for AUTEC. Temporary U.S. Mainland Headquarters was opened at the Orlando Air Force Base in September 1966 with Captain L. L. Jackson, Jr., being assigned as Prospective Commanding Officer. Following a study of possible locations for a permanent headquarters the West Palm Beach, Florida area was chosen due to the combined facilities of the airport and the Port of Palm Beach, plus its proximity to Andros Island. On 26 February 1967, AUTEC was commissioned at West Palm Beach when Admiral E. J. Fahy, Commander, Naval Ship Systems Command, presented Captain Jackson with orders making him the first Commanding Officer, and AUTEC became an operational field activity. In May 1967, headquarters personnel moved from Orlando to West Palm Beach and established offices at the Palm Beach International Airport in the building which was formerly the Airport Terminal. In July 1967 at a Change of Command ceremony on Andros Island, Commander Barney was relieved by the new Officer-in-Charge, Andros Ranges, Commander Frank A. Smith. First of the three ranges to become operational was the Weapons Range in 1966. This was followed by the Acoustics Range, a portion of which became operational in 1968 with a total operational capability anticipated by the end of 1969. First phase of the Sonar Range became operational in January 1968, and the final phases, were scheduled to be completed and operational by 1974.U.S. Navy AUTEC Soundings, August 1969. Namesakes Major facilities at AUTEC's Andros Island base were named in 1969 in honor of various Navy heroes: * Shafer Brothers Hall, the 116-man Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ), was named in honor of Benjamin N. and John D. Shafer, who were Chief Electrician's Mates aboard the USS Thresher when she was lost in 1963. * Jacobson Hall, the 250-man BEQ was named in honor of George W. Jacobson, Sr., Chief Motor Machinist's Mate who died in 1966. During World War II he served aboard the USS Pillsbury and received the Silver Star Medal for his valiant service during the capture of a German submarine off French West Africa in June 1944. * Mackey Hall, the BEQ Mess, was named in honor of Harry E. Mackey, Jr., an Aviation Machinist's Mate killed in action in November 1943. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism and extraordinary achievement during operations off French Morocco. * Momsen Hall, the 75-man Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQ), was named in honor of Vice Admiral Charles B. Momsen who died in May 1967. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for developing the Momsen Lung. * Danenhower Hall, the BOQ Mess, was named in honor of Lt. Commander Sloan Danenhower who died in November 1967.He was a pioneer submariner who commanded the original USS Nautilus on an Arctic expedition in 1931. He was the son of John Wilson Danenhower, commander of the USS Jeannette. * Roger L. Glei Chapel was named after Roger L. Glei who, in 1969 during the Vietnam War, left his protected armored position during heavy gunfire to aid an injured vehicle machinegunner and consequently sacrificed his own life. Previous to joining the U.S. Army, Roger's parents, Alfred and Ruth Glei, brought him to AUTEC in October 1966.Chickcharney News, April 1987 See also *BUTEC *Naval Sea Systems Command *Naval Undersea Warfare Center  Notes  External links *Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport, Rhode Island AUTEC Category:United States Navy organization ","title":"Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center"},{"id":"7141442","text":"a retainer under the Japanese clan of Hosokawa during the Edo period (17th century) of Japan.

They are thus baryons, with total isospin of 0, and have either neutral electric charge or the elementary charge +1. Overview The Lambda baryon was first discovered in October 1950, by V. D. Hopper and S. Biswas of the University of Melbourne, as a neutral V particle with a proton as a decay product, thus correctly distinguishing it as a baryon, rather than a meson, i.e. different in kind from the K meson discovered in 1947 by Rochester and Butler; they were produced by cosmic rays and detected in photographic emulsions flown in a balloon at . Though the particle was expected to live for ,The Strange Quark it actually survived for . The property that caused it to live so long was dubbed strangeness and led to the discovery of the strange quark. Furthermore, these discoveries led to a principle known as the conservation of strangeness, where in lightweight particles do not decay as quickly if they exhibit strangeness (because non-weak methods of particle decay must preserve the strangeness of the decaying baryon). In 1974 and 1975, an international team at the Fermilab that included scientists from Fermilab and seven European laboratories under the leadership of Eric Burhop carried out a search for a new particle, the existence of which Burhop had predicted in 1963. He had suggested that neutrino interactions could create short-lived (perhaps as low as 10‚àí14 s) particles that could be detected with the use of nuclear emulsion. Experiment E247 at Fermilab successfully detected particles with a lifetime of the order of 10‚àí13 s. A follow-up experiment WA17 with the SPS confirmed the existence of the (charmed Lambda baryon), with a flight time of . In 2011, the international team at JLab used high-resolution spectrometer measurements of the reaction H(e, e'K+)X at small Q2 (E-05-009) to extract the pole position in the complex-energy plane (primary signature of a resonance) for the Lambda(1520) with mass = 1518.8 MeV and width = 17.2 MeV which seem to be smaller than their Breit‚ÄìWigner values. The first determination of the pole position for a hyperon. The Lambda baryon has also been observed in atomic nuclei called hypernuclei. These nuclei contain the same number of protons and neutrons as a known nucleus, but also contains one or in rare cases two Lambda particles. In such a scenario, the Lambda slides into the center of the nucleus (it is not a proton or a neutron, and thus is not affected by the Pauli exclusion principle), and it binds the nucleus more tightly together due to its interaction via the strong force. In a lithium isotope (Œõ7Li), it made the nucleus 19% smaller. Types of Lambda baryons Lambda baryons are usually represented by the symbols , , , and . In this notation, the superscript character indicates whether the particle is electrically neutral (0) or carries a positive charge (+). The subscript character, or its absence, indicates whether the third quark is a strange quark (no subscript), a charm quark , a bottom quark , or a top quark . Physicists do not expect to observe a Lambda baryon with a top quark because the Standard Model of particle physics predicts that the mean lifetime of top quarks is roughly seconds; that is about of the mean timescale for strong interactions, which indicates that the top quark would decay before a Lambda baryon could form a hadron. The symbols encountered in this list are: I (isospin), J (total angular momentum quantum number), P (parity), Q (charge), S (strangeness), C (charmness), B‚Ä≤ (bottomness), T (topness), u (up quark), d (down quark), s (strange quark), c (charm quark), b (bottom quark), t (top quark), as well as other subatomic particles. Antiparticles are not listed in the table; however, they simply would have all quarks changed to antiquarks, and Q, B, S, C, B‚Ä≤, T, would be of opposite signs. I, J, and P values in red have not been firmly established by experiments, but are predicted by the quark model and are consistent with the measurements. The top Lambda () is listed for comparison, but is not expected to be observed, because top quarks decay before they have time to hadronize. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Lambda baryons |- ! class=unsortable|Particle name !

After this original performance, the Marching Hundred was invited back to the RCA dome to perform for the Indianapolis Colts' first playoff game in January 2007. However, due to the Colts not achieving home field advantage throughout the playoffs, the Hundred was not able to perform. The following season, the Hundred performed as the halftime entertainment for the Colts' season opener on Thursday, 6 September 2007. For the 2008 season, the Hundred performed for the Indianapolis Colts at their first regular season game at Lucas Oil Stadium making it the first marching band to perform on the field at the brand new stadium. Additionally in 2008, the Marching Hundred was asked to perform for a Chicago Bears game at Soldier Field.

Although destined for production it got no further than the prototypes before Poland was invaded. Design and development Polish twin-engined military trainer aircraft PWS-33 Wy≈ºe≈Ç 2'nd prototype With an expected advent of a twin-engine heavy fighter, the PZL.38 Wilk, which was supposed to be a basic fighter and bomber aircraft in the Polish Air Force, there appeared the need for a twin-engine trainer aircraft for pilots. In 1936, the PWS works were ordered to build a trainer of cheap wooden construction, similar in layout to the PZL.38. The main designer was Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski, known for designing several successful sailplanes. The prototype of the PWS-33 first flew in August‚ÄìSeptember 1938. The aircraft appeared successful with good flight characteristics and the maximum speed turned out to be even higher than had been estimated. It was given a name Wy≈ºe≈Ç (Polish: \\"pointer\\"). The prototype was soon shown at the Paris Air Show, in November‚ÄìDecember 1938 (under the name PZL Wy≈ºe≈Ç) and met with an interest in the world press. In January 1939 the second prototype PWS-33/II flew. It was also capable of aerobatics. The plane was quite light and small and comparable to the single-engine trainer PWS-26. After trials, the plane was ordered into production. In the meantime, the PZL.38 Wilk program was appearing unsuccessful due to lack of proper engines and was canceled. However the PWS-33 could still find a place as a trainer for pilots of PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ medium bombers, which were also similar in appearance to the PWS-33, and for future heavy fighters such as the PZL.48 Lampart. In summer 1939 production of the first series of 25 aircraft started but they were not completed due to the outbreak of war.

The band performs at all home Hawkeye football games at Kinnick Stadium. It is the largest and most visible musical ensemble at the university and was awarded the Louis Sudler Intercollegiate Marching Band Trophy in 1990. The band was founded in 1881 as a military band, giving membership to both music students and members of the military. History The Hawkeye Marching Band was founded in 1881 in order to provide music for the State University of Iowa Battalion. During this time, members of the band would undergo the same training as their military counterparts. However, over the years, the military and band would gradually grow into separate entities. Because of this growing rift between the two organizations, the marching band became more of a form of entertainment than a military group by the year 1929, the same year that Kinnick Stadium was completed. The band became a part of the Fine Arts department in 1936. Around this time, when the distinction between the military and the marching band grew larger, the band began to perform for more public events, rather than the military gatherings of the past. The Iowa marching band, like other Big Ten bands, began to make appearances at concerts, university ceremonies, and football games. During the mid-twentieth century, the band adopted a very militaristic style of marching. Marchers were expected to march with crack precision and the band's director during that time, Frederick C. Ebbs, eliminated any flags or twirlers that the band had used up to that point. In 1973, Morgan Jones became director of the Hawkeye Marching Band and once again changed the style and look of the band. Jones added a line of flag color guard and six other twirlers to accompany the featured twirler. Jones also changed the style of music played. The band began to perform different styles of music, easygoing slow music and loud fast-paced music, as well as displaying both abstract formations and recognizable patterns on the field. The Hawkeye Marching Band was widely regarded as one of the few bands that effectively executed all of these things. After the 1990 season, the band was awarded the prestigious John Philip Sousa Foundation Sudler Trophy. The 1990 season and the Sudler Trophy would mark the end of the Morgan Jones era for the HMB. Jones' 18-year period as director was one of the most successful in the history of the Hawkeye Marching Band. The band went through three different directors during the next few years and included a brief return by Morgan Jones during the mid-1990s. In the summer of 1998, the band found its next permanent director in Leroy Kevin Kastens, former director of the Marching Mizzou from the University of Missouri, as well as the Marching Hundred, from Indiana University. Kastens' tenure at Iowa lasted 20 years, as he retired in the spring of 2018. After a national search, Dr. Eric W. Bush, was chosen as the next Associate Director of Bands and the Director of the Hawkeye Marching Band. Bush previously served as Assistant Director of Bands and Assistant Director of the Marching Blue Band at The Pennsylvania State University. Before that, he served as a graduate teaching assistant while earning the D.M.A. in band conducting degree from the University of Iowa. Personnel The drumline and sousaphone sections prepare for the pregame show. Instrumentation There are ten sections in the HMB: piccolos, clarinets, alto saxophones, tenor saxophones, trumpets, mellophones, trombones, baritones, sousaphones, and a drumline consisting of snare drums, tenor drums, bass drums, and cymbals. Instrumental sections are led by a section leader, who is charged with teaching the required musical selections for a particular show; and an \\"undergrad staff\\" member, who is in charge of teaching marching fundamentals to the section during the band's training week. The HMB uses a squad system when writing drills for both pregame and halftime. Squads are composed of four members of a particular section and are designated an alphabetical symbol in marching drills. Sometimes, squads can be composed of members of different sections. For example, one particular squad may be made up of two members of the trumpet section and two members of the trombone section. Sometimes, members of a section are placed on \\"reserve\\" for a certain week. This is because the number of spots in a particular drill may not have enough spots for every member of a section. HMB members who are placed on reserve fill vacant spots during rehearsals and may even be called upon to fill spots during performances if the original member is not able to attend. Members placed on reserve may also be called upon to aid the graduate staff members with equipment or other items during performances. Drum Major The drum major position is the highest rank that an undergraduate student can attain in the Hawkeye Marching Band. The drum major performs routines during both pregame and halftime shows and incorporates a mace during these routines. Students achieving the rank of drum major are also required to instruct the band during much of the training period at the beginning of a marching season. The current drum major, Michael Janssen, will be returning as a sixth-year member for the 2020 season. Former drum major Analisa Iole became the first female drum major of the modern era in 2017. A former Hawkeye drum major and University of Iowa alumnus, David Woodley, is currently director of the Marching Hundred of Indiana University. Golden Girl Like many other collegiate marching bands, a featured baton twirler is used. In the HMB, this twirler is known as the \\"Golden Girl\\". The University of Iowa Golden Girl is one of only two full-tuition scholarships available to the feature twirlers in the nation. Like the drum major, the Golden Girl performs choreographed routines during both pregame and halftime. Many of these routines are choreographed for both the drum major and Golden Girl performing with each other. The current Golden Girl is Kylene Spanbauer. Former Golden Girls Linda Simon, Jayna Sanchez and Diana Reed represented Iowa, and Laurie Broderick represented Indiana, in the Miss America pageant; Jane Stemmerman represented Iowa in Distinguished Young Women.Distinguished Young Women All utilized their baton skills in the talent competition. Former Golden Girl Nikki Meredith (now Crawford) was World Champion twirler in 1984 and won the 2011 Ms Fitness USA. Section leaders and undergraduate staff Section leaders are undergraduate members of the HMB are responsible for the musical performance of their respective sections. Section leaders conduct musical warm-ups at all rehearsals, before performances, and instruct their sections on new musical selections. Undergraduate staff members instruct HMB members in their section, both first-year and veteran members, on marching fundamentals and techniques. Both section leaders and undergraduate staffers may be called upon to serve as squad leaders after the conclusion of camp. Marching style The HMB employs a traditional Big Ten chair step marching style, where the upper leg is lifted parallel to the ground forming a 120-degree angle with the lower leg, and the foot is pointed to the ground. The band uses this traditional style during their pregame performance, parades, and lengthy drum cadence called \\"The Series\\". During the band's halftime performance, a more contemporary low-step style (glide step) is used, where the toe is pointed upwards and the heel is rolled along the ground. Performances The HMB performs at halftime. The Hawkeye Marching Band performs at all Iowa Hawkeye home football games. The band also travels with the team to usually one away game per year and the team's post-season bowl game when the team plays in one. The band also travels to Ames, Iowa every other year when the Hawkeyes play the Iowa State Cyclones in the annual battle for the Cy-Hawk Trophy. The band also holds an indoor concert at Carver Hawkeye Arena (this concert was previously held in Hancher Auditorium but was moved due to the damage of Hancher Auditorium by the Flood of 2008) on the University of Iowa campus towards the end of the marching season. Along with other University musical groups, the HMB performs the traditional school songs like On Iowa, The Iowa Fight Song, and \\"Roll Along Iowa\\", and the different halftime selections from throughout the year. Every third year, the band travels to Cedar Rapids, Iowa where seven local metropolitan Cedar Rapids high school bands, along with the HMB, hold an exhibition of their halftime shows at the Cedar Rapids Indoor Marching Classic. The Hawkeye Marching Band rotates every third year with the Iowa State University Cyclone Football 'Varsity' Marching Band and the University of Northern Iowa Panther Marching Band. Directors Following are those who have held the position of the director of the Hawkeye Marching Band: *1906-1909 - Henry G. Cox *1909-1911 - Howard J. Barnum *1911-1936 - O.E. Van Doren *1937-1953 - Charles B. Righter *1954-1966 - Frederick C. Ebbs *1967 - Frank Piersol *1968-1972 - Tom Davis *1973-1990 - Morgan Jones *1991-1992 - David Woodley *1993-1995 - Dave Henning *1996-1997 - Morgan Jones *1998‚Äì2017 - Kevin Kastens *2018‚Äìpresent - Eric W. Bush Traditions Members participate in the annual Drill Down during camp. *Hawkeye Victory Polka - The HMB plays their rendition of the song \\"In Heaven There Is No Beer\\" after every Hawkeye victory. The band alternates between the verses instrumentally and vocally, along with Hawkeye fans. The song was originally played many times during a game when it was first introduced in the 1960s. However, controversy arose concerning the song's lyrics. Critics of the song claimed that the tune promoted the abuse of alcohol and that it was an inappropriate song for the band to play. In 2001, the University of Iowa President completely banned the song from being played, either instrumentally or vocally. However, overwhelming support for the song prompted the President to bring the song back to Hawkeye athletic events. The song is now performed only after Hawkeye victories and on special occasions. The song was learned by ear for a number of years due to a lack of music and other unknown reasons, however starting in 2014, original sheet music was found that had been lost after the 2008 flood which required the movement of all of the music in the University of Iowa's music library. Since then the band has used sheet music with the lyrics to the song printed along the bottom. *Hey Jude - Arranged by former HMB director Tom Davis, this popular Beatles classic was first played during a halftime show in 1969. The band then began to play the song during the break between the 3rd and 4th quarters. The band has played \\"Hey Jude\\" in this way ever since. The song is conducted by the band manager; starting it off with a loud \\"THREE! FOUR!\\", as the band performs its signature rendition. The song is played during the band's Rec Building Concert, post-game performances and other special events. *\\"Vocal Alma Mater\\" - Unlike some other schools in the Big Ten, the Iowa Alma Mater is not played at football games, due to the length of the song and the complexity of the lyrics and melodies. For this reason, the Alma Mater has been an 'unofficial trademark' of sorts for the HMB. They perform two versions of the Alma Mater, an instrumental ballad and a vocal version. The instrumental version is rarely played due to the popularity of the 4-part harmony vocal version. The band sings the vocal Alma Mater every week in the \\"tunnel\\" underneath Kinnick Stadium just before marching pre-game on the field. It is traditional that band members remove their marching shakos and/or hats, link arms and sway while performing the music. The band also sings the Alma Mater after the game is over and most fans have already cleared the stadium. *The Boom - \\"The Boom\\" has become a trademark of the Hawkeye Marching Band. Occurring immediately prior to the band's pregame routine at games, the band's announcer, Lou Crist, speaks through the stadium sound system \\"It's time to get ready for the boom!\\" Immediately following this announcement, the drum line's bass drum players all play a single count, creating a loud boom that echoes inside the stadium. The Boom signals the beginning of the pregame routine. *Rec Building Concert - Before every home football game, the HMB performs a brief concert inside the UI Recreation Building along with the Iowa Dance Team, cheerleaders, and the school mascot Herky. The band stands in concentric arcs and plays the common pregame fight songs as well as that week's halftime music. \\"The Series\\", the band's marching cadence, is also performed. During the football season of 2016, due to unexpected complications with the project, construction on the Rec Building was unable to be completed before the start of football season. The construction was not completed until after the football season and after having tried to find a different location the band was no longer able to perform the Rec show for that season. This construction was to fix different problems with the Rec Building an install a new indoor raised track for the Track and Field Team. Due to the unstable nature of this raised track, the band is no longer able to perform \\"the Series\\" in the Rec Building Show. The band performs their pregame concert on the raised track inside the Rec Building football season. *Bones and Tones - The Rec Building Concert's opening act. Members of the baritone and trombone sections combine to entertain the concert crowd with different musical selections every game. The music for these performances is typically arranged for multi-part bones and tones by the members themselves. The small ensemble features particular cheers and tunes unique to the two low brass sections. Though in recent years, this has become less and less common. *Trumpet's Pre-game Rec Building Music - Similar to Bones and Tones, the Trumpets will traditionally play a warm-up before the start of every rec building show. In recent years, the section has been adding more arrangements to their concert such as \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" by Mariah Carey that is played at the last home game of the year and other popular tunes such as the Fairly Odd Parents theme and songs from Aladdin. This traditionally goes 15 minutes before the start of the rec building show. *Saxamatone Kickball - During camp, the baritone and saxophone (both alto and tenor) sections combine to play a game of kickball on the marching band's practice field. No other sections may participate in the competition, but the drum major and Golden Girl may participate as either player or as officials. In 2017, the saxophones came back in the bottom of the 10th from a 4-point deficit in a stunning overtime victory to clinch the saxamatone title, 13-12. For the 2018 match-up, not enough baritones showed up on time for the game. This led to two alto saxophone undergraduate staff members to be selected as captains and they chose their teams from the pool of all saxophones and all the present baritones. The very high scoring game was ended with the team selected by undergraduate staff member Tyler McKenzie winning over the section leader Nick deBlois' team 17-13. This is the first time the saxophones both won and lost. *Trumpet-Trombone Annual Football Game - The Trumpets and Trombones play each other in a full-contact football game either during the bye week or first away game Iowa plays. The game is played for the coveted trophy \\"Lefty.\\" The trophy has a left athletic running shoe, a trumpet, and a trombone mouthpiece affixed on a wooden plank that is spray painted gold. Men and women of both sections are encouraged to participate as well as spectate the event. The rest of the band is also encouraged to spectate but barred from participating since the game is exclusively played by Trumpets and Trombones. Following the windiest game ever, the Trombones notched their first win of the series. The following year the Trombones won 18-6, thanks to their unstoppable offense and a grimy defense. The trumpets lead the series 4-2. *\\"Sousie Bowl\\" - During the week of the Iowa/Iowa State rivalry game the sousaphone sections from both the Hawkeye Marching Band and the Iowa State University Marching Band come together for a game of full- contact football. This annual event alternates sites depending on which university is hosting the rivalry game that Saturday. *The Salt Block - The Salt Block was just that - a block of salt commonly used in cattle feeding - carried along on band trips and events by the Sousaphone section. The block was featured at nearly every Sousie skit at the yearly Band Extravaganza. The tradition was that the Salt Block would be held for one year, then passed to another member of the Sousaphone section for safekeeping. It is traditional that every Sousie licks the salt block, in order from the most experienced member to the newest. The Salt Block continues to be a part of \\"certain section's antics.\\" *Drill Down - Towards the end of camp, all members of the band participate in a competition known as the Drill Down. The band begins in a large block formation and the drum major calls out various commands. If a band member makes any sort of mistake during this competition, he/she is eliminated from the competition. It is common for the drum major to intentionally confuse band members in order to gauge their concentration and skill. The eliminations continue until only one member is left and crowned the winner. This practice was discontinued during the tenure of Professor Kastens. *From Dixie with Love - During Morgan Jones' tenure as director the band would typically close out the annual Band Extravaganza with Dr. Jones' arrangement of \\"From Dixie with Love\\", a slow ballad utilizing the melody of the tune Dixie that crescendos into an uptempo song, still with \\"Dixie\\" as the melody. This was often referenced as a farewell to the graduating seniors during the concert.

His essays have been published in seven languages. In his profile as an editor of the Leonardo Electronic Almanac, Penny describes his interests as follows: \\"My ongoing concern with the negotiation of practices, discourses and commitments in engineering with respect to those of the arts has involved an extended consideration of the history and theory of Artificial Intelligence and the forms of Cognitive Science related to it. These fields enforce a deeply dualising model of human being which is incompatible with practices of the arts. The adoption of computational technology into the arts has the insidious effect of ‚Äòhollowing- out‚Äô long traditions of embodied practices. I have referred to this as a Trojan Horse effect. Fortuitously, over the last two decades, a reaction to such dualising has also occurred in cognitive science. The new distributed, embodied, enactive and situated cognitive sciences address the kinds of embodied practices and sensibilities I have been focusing on in the arts.\\"http://www.leoalmanac.org/editorial-board/simon-penny/ Notable works * Phatus (2010) - http://simonpenny.net/works/phatus.html * Walleye (2006-2009) - http://simonpenny.net/works/walleye.html * Body Electric (2006) - http://www.eng.uci.edu/node/182 * Fugitive II (2004) - https://web.archive.org/web/20060919173755/http://www.acmi.net.au/fugitive.jsp * Bedlam (2003)- http://billvorn.concordia.ca/robography/Bedlam.html * Traces (1999) - http://simonpenny.net/works/traces.html * Petit Mal (1993) - http://simonpenny.net/works/petitmal.html * Big Father (1991‚Äì1992) - http://simonpenny.net/works/bigfather.html * Pride of Our Young Nation (1990‚Äì1991) http://simonpenny.net/works/pride.html * Lo Yo Yo (1988) - http://simonpenny.net/works/loyoyo.html * Stupid Robot (1987) - http://simonpenny.net/works/stupidrobot.html See also *Critical technical practice *Interactive art *Artificial Life References External links *http://simonpenny.net *http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=4664 Category:1955 births Category:University of California, Irvine faculty Category:American contemporary artists Category:Australian roboticists Category:Robotic art Category:People educated at Newington College Category:University of Florida faculty Category:Australian digital artists Category:Living people Category:American roboticists ","title":"Simon Penny"},{"id":"7141531","text":"PVZ or PvZ may refer to: * Party for Zeeland, a provincial political party in the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands * Plants vs. Zombies, a tower defense action video game developed and originally published by PopCap Games ** Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time, the sequel to Plants vs. Zombies ** Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare, a video game, part of Plants vs. Zombies series ** Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2, a 2016 video game, part of Plants vs. Zombies series ** Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville, a 2019 video game, part of Plants vs. Zombies series ** Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, a 2016 video game, part of Plants vs. Zombies series * P√≥voa de Varzim, a Portuguese city in the Norte Region and sub-region of Greater Porto * Paige VanZant, an American mixed martial artist See also *PVC, a chemical ","title":"PVZ"},{"id":"7141535","text":"Philip Alexander Munz, botanist, taxonomist and educator (1892‚Äì1974), of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, was Professor of Botany at Pomona College, serving as Dean for three years.

It was Nagaoka Sado himself who had protected Miyamoto Musashi as for him to be able to duel against the famous Sasaki Kojir≈ç in 1612. At one time on the battlefield during the year of 1638, Musashi had met Sado. Sado had known at the time that Musashi was living in the house of Ogasawara, but he had learned that it was Musashi's son, Miyamoto Iori who had been under the service of the Ogasawara, and that Musashi was there as a guest. Sado had also learned that Musashi had no true intention of entering under the lord's service, and that he was only taking part in that battle (Ogasawara establishment in northern Ky≈´sh≈´) as a staff in order to be an advisor to his son. After Sado had then returned to the province of Higo, he began planning the steps to get Musashi into the service of his fief, since he had already known that Lord Hosokawa Tadatoshi was interested in him. However, Tadatoshi had been previously schooled in the wisdom of the feudal system, in which he ordered for Musashi to act prudently, because Musashi's current situation as he had known, was residing within the house of Ogasawara, in relation to the fact that it would be a major mistake to show discourtesy. Sado started out by first sending a letter to Musashi, because the steps for employment had to be taken very discreetly. Musashi had politely responded saying that he had no intention of having a lord. During the year of 1639, Sado had passed through the region of Kokura‚Äîwithin Ky≈´sh≈´ province‚Äîon his official business. Sado had taken this advantage to visit the house of Musashi's son in order to see Musashi, to whom he had communicated the wish of his lord, as well as his own. After not receiving a true answer, Sado departed, with Musashi later accepting the Hosokawa offer, as a guest, not a vassal. However, near the end of his life, Musashi was formally received as a retainer of Lord Hosokawa.

The two clubs transferred their senior players to the new club, but continued as separate entities concentrating on development of children and youngsters. The colors of Drammen HK became blue - the same color as background of the city coat of arms. Reistad IL was qualified to play in Norway Premier Division, so Drammen really got a flying start starting at the top level. However, Drammen did not make it through and was degraded to the Second Division the year after. However, In 1993 Drammen HK signed the Swedish trainer Kent Harry Anderson, and returned to the Premier Division after one year. This was the beginning of a series of successes that was crowned in 1995, bringing home the City Cup as the first Norwegian club ever to win a European title. Some of the best Norway international players started their senior careers at Drammen HK, such as Glenn Solberg, Frode Hagen and Kristian Kjelling.

In his first year of high school, Price ventured into the band room after having no interest in woodwork or metal work. The teacher instructed him to sit behind a snare drum, due to requiring a drummer and this would change his life forever. Following a brief stint in his high school marching band, he was recruited to play drums for the school's band. He then worked as a roadie for the band of his high school friend, keyboardist Cory Lerios, but when the drummer quit, Price became the new drummer.

The show was originally hosted by English soap opera veteran Finola Hughes; the latest season was hosted by celebrity stylist Jeannie Mai. The show features \\"fashion victims,\\" purportedly turned in by their friends, coworkers, and family members. Although there are variations in each episode tailored to the individual contestant, every episode follows the same basic pattern.  Overview  Each episode begins with a short montage introducing the subject of the makeover. Contestants typically are victims of a combination of poor fashion sense and lifestyle situations that exacerbate the problem. The makeover often coincides with a turning point in the person's life, such as starting college, changing careers, or losing weight. Two \\"accomplices\\" who are close to the contestant express concern over the negative effect of the contestant's appearance on their life. The accomplices express their view that the contestant's physical appearance is socially unacceptable and can only be repaired through the application of new clothes, new hair and new make-up. Accomplices openly express their contempt for the clothing and style choices the contestant has made heretofore. Accomplices may be family members (spouses, parents, children, siblings, etc.), friends, or coworkers. These two people will be joined by a third accomplice, a professional stylist. Together the three go through the contestant's entire wardrobe, each choosing pieces to throw out. Accomplices will be realistic about the contestant's type of style and they will also criticize it. The host and the contestant will then confront the accomplices who will then detail their reactions to the contestant's wardrobe. In the first season, accomplices were limited to only one item, but in subsequent seasons, they are shown removing multiple or many items. Contestants are often distressed and hurt as the accomplices throw out favorite items and critique the contestant's style, though some are more open to change than others. The hosts are often seen throwing clothes into a tube. The contestant has an opportunity to respond to the criticism and make requests regarding the makeover. The contestant then has a one-on-one conversation with the host about the reasons behind their clothing choices, feelings about the critiques, and fears and expectations for the rest of the makeover. The segment ends with the host sending the accomplices to shop for clothing. Occasionally, the shopping period is paired with a special trip for the contestant that somehow reflects their needs. Such trips include spa visits, dancing lessons, and therapy sessions. Each accomplice is given $1200 to spend on a collection of three outfits for the contestant. Two of the three outfits must fit set themes based on the contestant's lifestyle and needs and are generally given titles that are puns or clich√©d phrases that play on these elements. For example, the episode featuring teacher Marlena McTigue included the outfit theme \\"Making the Grade.\\" The final outfit in each collection is the \\"Wildcard,\\" an outfit that the accomplice feels the contestant's wardrobe needs. In some episodes, collections must include an element of the contestant's original wardrobe, as in the episode featuring Karen Maruyama where the accomplices were required to incorporate a pair of shoes from Maruyama's existing collection. Each collection also includes a set of makeup and a new hairstyle. The contestant must choose one collection and accept it in its entirety. The following day, the host and the contestant watch footage of each accomplice's shopping spree. The footage is intentionally deceptive, featuring no clothing that is included in the final collections. Accomplices will often home in on clothing in colors or styles for which the contestant has expressed specific distaste or clothing similar to that which they have just thrown out. The host and the contestant react accordingly. During the next segment, the contestant is presented with each complete collection. The host introduces each outfit, and then the two react to it. At the end of each collection, the host presents the makeup and hair style chosen by the accomplice. The hair styles are described in terms of a celebrity with a similar style. The presentation segment is followed by a fashion shoot where the contestant tries on each outfit, comments on the clothing, and then makes a guess as to which accomplice put together each collection. Beginning with the third season, the accomplices watch footage of the fashion shoot behind a one-way mirror, and we see them react to the victim's comments about the clothing they try on. After the segment, the one-way mirror turns off, and accomplices surprise the contestant. After the fashion shoot, the contestant chooses a collection. They are taken to a salon for the matching hair and makeup. The salon scenes are in typical makeover show fashion, with the contestant's face only shown in close-ups in order to keep the contestant's decision and final look a surprise until the end. Occasionally, final close- ups show enough of the hair or makeup to ruin the surprise, particularly in episodes where each accomplice has chosen a distinct hair style to match their collection. The final segment begins with the host meeting again with the three accomplices. They each discuss their shopping decisions for a final time. They are joined by a small audience of additional family members and friends of the contestant. The contestant then enters the room on a catwalk, asking, \\"how do I look?\\" They are asked to make a final guess on who created the collection they chose. Contestants are often given an additional prize. Sometimes these prizes are part of an ultimatum where the contestant must choose between a mystery reward and a beloved piece of clothing, at other times they are dependent on the contestant correctly guessing the creator of the chosen collection. Often, however, the bonus prizes involve no extra criteria. A typical prize is a $1000 gift certificate for a new wardrobe, but prizes are sometimes more tailored to the contestant. For example, a contestant known for hiding behind glasses may receive a year's worth of contact lenses. Commercial breaks are often trailed with segments featuring quick fashion tips directed at the viewer. These tips are often solutions to common fashion faux pas and are presented either by the host or that episode's featured stylist. Grammy nominated rapper Yo-Yo on How Do I Look?.

Early life and education Crewe was born in Bradford, England, in 1927 and grew up during World War II in a blue collar community still recovering from the worldwide depression. The family was poor and expectations were limited. He had average grades in school but passed two nationwide examinations, the first of which enabled him to become the first in his family to attend high school and the second of which allowed him to attend college. He attended Carlton Grammar School, in the south-east of Bradford, since 1977 called Carlton Bolling College. He won a military scholarship to the University of Liverpool to pursue an undergraduate degree in physics, which he received in 1947. He received a first class degree with high honors, which allowed him a scholarship to continue on at Liverpool for his Ph.D. At the age of 24 he was hired by the university as an instructor in physics and received his degree one year later, in 1951. Synchrocyclotron research At the University of Liverpool, Crewe worked with Professor Skinner, the Lyon Jones Chair of Physics. Skinner and his team were in the process of building a synchrocyclotron accelerator and wanted to improve on existing technology by extracting the circulating beam to produce an external one, a feat which had never been accomplished. Skinner gave Crewe the responsibility for extracting the beam and he proved successful, using an innovative peeler-regenerator system. A few years later a team of physicists from the University of Chicago, sent by Enrico Fermi, went to Liverpool for help in solving a similar problem with the Chicago synchrocyclotron. That visit led to an invitation for Crewe to go to the University of Chicago as a visiting research associate in 1955. A year later, after he and a theoretical physicist succeeded in getting the cyclotron to work, the University of Chicago hired Crewe as an assistant professor. Crewe (right, facing camera) explains the ZGS's Cockroft-Walton preaccelerator. In 1958 Crewe moved to the Argonne National Laboratory, in DuPage County, Illinois. One of the U.S. government's oldest and largest science and engineering research laboratories, Argonne is managed for the U.S. Department of Energy by the University of Chicago. After the war, Argonne was given the mission of developing nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes. A large accelerator was being planned at Argonne, and Crewe was part of a team recruited to make sure that the machine would be state of the art. After Congress approved the machine Crewe was made director of the Particle Accelerator Division at Argonne.Teng, L. C., Accelerators and I, Beam Dynamics Newsletter No. 35, December 2004, p. 11. http://www.aai.anl.gov/history/project_pages/reference_documents/lee_teng_autobiography_ref.pdf When Norman Hilberry, the director of Argonne, retired in 1961, Crewe was asked to become the third director of the 5000 employee facility.Holl, Jack M., Hewlett, Richard G. & Harris, Ruth R., Argonne National Laboratory, 1946-96 (University of Illinois Press, 1997), pp.208-210. Electron Microscopy While at Argonne Crewe became interested in electron microscopy, an interest stimulated by the major biology program there. Crewe saw ways in which it would be possible to improve the images important to that work. He came up with a design for a scanning electron microscope and set up a group at Argonne to build it, getting it to function in 1963. This work became so interesting to Crewe that in 1967 he decided to leave Argonne and return to the university‚Äôs physics faculty, which had granted him a full professorship in 1963. In 1964 Crewe developed the first field emission electron gun in collaboration with Hitachi,IEEE Milestone - First Practical Field Emission Electron Microscope, 1972 a new type of electron source that enabled much higher optical quality than had previously been possible. This gun, combined with inventions in electron lenses and detection, led to the development of the highest resolution microscope at that time. In 1970 his field emission scanning transmission electron microscope succeeded in taking images individual atom (though not the first, this achievement usually being credited to Erwin Mullerhttp://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/83/8348atoms.html). In 1975 he was successful in obtaining the first motion pictures of atoms, providing new insight into atomic interaction and material formation. There followed, during the 1980s, a series of important refining techniques. In 1980 he invented a method for the correction of spherical aberration in electron optical systems using sextupoles and, in 1996, Crewe invented a new type of focusing lens for low voltage scanning microscopes. He held 19 patents for his inventions, and had more than 275 publications, most of them concerned with electron optics and electron microscopes. Beginning in the 1970s and continuing to the present day commercial electron microscopes were developed based on Crewe‚Äôs innovations. These systems enabled significant advances in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries. Hitachi Corporation produced the first successful commercial version of the field emission scanning electron microscope in 1970 which received an IEEE Milestone award in 2012. Crewe was a consultant to Hitachi in this effort. Since that time Hitachi has produced over 5300 cold field emission scanning electron microscopes and over 4000 (Schottky) thermal field emission scanning electron microscopes. They are considered the highest resolution instruments available and cost over one million USD each to build. Today there are over 5000 field emission microscopes operational in semiconductor fabrication facilities worldwide, enabling companies like Intel and IBM to produce the latest and fastest microprocessors. Crewe served as Dean of Physical Sciences at the University of Chicago from 1971-1981. In 1977 was named the William E. Wrather Distinguished Service Professor, and from 2002 he was the Wrather Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus. He continued to explore new methods of obtaining high resolution, and in 2003 developed a low voltage electron microscope using a dipole permanent magnet as a lens. Honors Crewe‚Äôs distinguished scientific career and his contribution to the use of technologies for wider applications have been recognized by numerous awards. The Chicago Citizenship Council nominated him Outstanding New Citizen in 1962, and in the same year he received the Immigrants Service League‚Äôs Annual Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Science, and was named Chicago Man of the Year in Science. He won the Man of the Year Award for Industrial Research in 1970 and was awarded the Albert A. Michelson Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1977 and the Distinguished Service Award of the Electron Microscope Society of America in 1976. He became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1972. In 1979 he received the Ernst Abbe Award of the New York Microscope society. In the U.K. he received the Duddell Medal of the Institute of Physics in 1980 and he held honorary fellowships in America, Great Britain, and China, as well as honorary degrees from several universities in America as well as from the University of Liverpool.

Mikinosuke was famous for being the first of three adopted sons of the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. One day Miyamoto Musashi had been traveling on horseback along the Settsu road. At a certain inn at Nishinomiya, Musashi had seen a boy of fourteen or fifteen who had taken Musashi's horse for him. Musashi had perceived extraordinary qualities from this boy‚ÄîMikinosuke. Musashi then asked the boy, \\"Wouldn't you like to become my son? I would find a good lord for you.\\". Mikinosuke replied, \\"You are very kind to make such an offer, but I have old parents. The reason I am working as a hostler is to take care of them. If I became your adoptive son, my parents would immediately fall on hard times. I must therefore tell you no, with my thanks.\\". Musashi had then gone to Mikinosuke's house and met his parents. Musashi then had explained his plans to them, receiving their consent to adopt him. He then took Mikinosuke with him after giving a small sum of supportive money to his parents. Musashi had then educated Mikinosuke for some time, in which he had then presented Mikonosuke to Lord Taiyu (Honda Tadatoki), the lord over the Himeji Castle within Banshu, who had thought very highly of Mikonosuke, in which is where he attained the name \\"Mikinosuke\\". For unknown reasons later on, Mikinosuke had taken leave of Lord Taiyu, in which he had headed to Edo. Unfortunately however, Taiya had died shortly after. Musashi, saddened over this, concluded that Mikinosuke would most surely come back for a farewell feast with Musashi within the next few days. After a few days had passed, Mikinosuke had come, in which he was very happy and took great pleasure within this farwell feast. After some time with Musashi at the feast, Mikinosuke picked up a glass of sake, saying, \\"I drink this glass to bid you farewell.\\".

He also served with distinction in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. After the war he served as one of President George Washington's personal secretaries. Early life and military career Born in the county of Cumberland, England, Jackson was sent to Charleston in South Carolina after the death of his parents. He was raised by a family friend and prominent merchant, Owen Roberts, who was the commander of a militia battalion. After the war broke out in 1775, Roberts joined the Patriot side, and the teenaged Jackson followed; Roberts probably helped Jackson to obtain a position as a cadet in the 1st South Carolina Regiment. In May 1776 Jackson was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Jackson first saw action near Charleston in June 1776, when his regiment fought off General Sir Henry Clinton's attempted attack on Fort Sullivan. The unit then spent a long period garrisoning the city of Charleston, during which Charles Cotesworth Pinckney assumed command of the 1st South Carolina. Late in 1777, Jackson was part of the detachment that made an ill-conceived and worse conducted expedition against St. Augustine in British East Florida under Major-General Robert Howe. The expedition was a colossal failure, and the American force was struck down by disease. Jackson survived, and returned to South Carolina in 1778. After the return from Florida, the Southern regiments were placed under the command of Major-General Benjamin Lincoln, from Massachusetts. Pinckney convinced Lincoln that as a Northerner, he needed an aide to assist him in relating to his Southern troops. Jackson was chosen for this position and was temporarily promoted to the rank of major. As Lincoln's aide he saw action in the Battle of Stono Ferry and the Siege of Savannah in 1779. In 1780 General Lincoln surrendered his troops after the lengthy Siege of Charleston. As a captured officer, Jackson was shipped to Philadelphia, then held by the British. After a few months he was returned to the Continental Army in an exchange of prisoners. A skilled staff officer, Jackson was then assigned to General Washington's staff, serving as secretary to the general's aide John Laurens, son of Henry Laurens of South Carolina. When Laurens was sent to France in 1781 armed with a Memorial written by George Washington outlining why a sizable loan (25 million livres) was needed, he took Jackson, who, like Laurens, had a good command of French, and with them at his own expense went Thomas Paine. Upon their arrival at Versailles, for six weeks they dealt unsuccessfully with Foreign Affairs Minister Vergennes, a longtime diplomat who wanted England tied up in an American war but knew the precarious situation of France's own finances. Finally, against Franklin's advice, direct contact was made with the King and Washington's Memorial handed to him. The following day the King had directed his Finance Minister, Jacques Necker, to meet with them. The loan was made, the bulk of it for military supplies, 3 million of it in gold specie, and the promise that France would underwrite with Dutch agents a later loan for 10 million should it be needed. Purchases began, and by early May Laurens sailed with 3 ships and Jackson went to Holland where John Adams had contracted with a Captain for the 4th ship. That ship vanished, either because Adams had been deceived about the honesty of the Captain or because the British Navy, with orders to hunt down all 4 ships, had sunk it. The 3 ships, however, after 3 months of scooting about the ocean, arrived in Boston in early September. Jackson himself returned to the United States in February 1782, and was assistant secretary of war to Benjamin Lincoln. The Confederation's Department of War, like the British, was a financial liaison with the Army; Jackson helped settle the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783. In October 1783, he resigned his office, and his commission, to become Robert Morris's agent in England; when he returned the next year, he studied law with the Philadelphia lawyer William Lewis. Constitutional Convention Jackson (standing, center, in red) features prominently in Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States by Howard Chandler Christy (1940) As an impoverished law student, in 1787, Jackson wrote to Washington applying for the post as secretary to the Philadelphia Convention. On the Convention's first day of business, May 25, 1787, Alexander Hamilton nominated Jackson to the post, and the delegates chose him over William Temple Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's grandson, despite the latter's experience serving as his grandfather's secretary during the Treaty of Paris negotiations. As the Convention secretary, Jackson had a number of duties, including maintaining the secrecy of the Convention's proceedings, keeping official minutes, and destroying many of the proceedings' other records. He signed the document \\"Attest William Jackson Secretary\\" to attest to four corrections which had been made to the document.Madison, James (1902) The Writings of James Madison, vol. 4, 1787: The Journal of the Constitutional Convention, Part II (edited by G. Hunt), pp. 501‚Äì502 Jackson was sent to the Congress of the Confederation, assembled in New York City, with a copy of the Constitution, and was honored to read it out to the Congress just days after the signing, on September 20, 1787. Life after the Convention Elizabeth Willing Jackson, portrait by Gilbert Stuart Major Jackson was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1788, but in those days, he had to wait two years to practice before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the most lucrative branch of the law; besides this, he was an (unpaid) volunteer in the Second Philadelphia Light Horse. He applied to be secretary of the United States Senate, but Samuel Allyne Otis was appointed. He then applied to be personal secretary to George Washington, now first President of the United States, writing that he had unpaid expenses as a Continental officer, and that business was \\"not congenial to [his] temper.\\" He resigned in 1791 to restart his law practice, and work as agent for William Bingham and Henry Knox (then Secretary of War), who were selling off a large land grant in Maine first acquired by William Duer, first Undersecretary of the Treasury and now bankrupt. Jackson's job was selling land on commission in England and France; among his potential customers was the Committee of Public Safety. They declined to invest their scanty funds in Maine land; but Jackson wrote a very favorable report on them back to the United States. He returned to the United States in the summer of 1795, and married Elizabeth Willing, Mrs. Bingham's sister, in November; they were the oldest daughters of Thomas Willing, a rich Philadelphia merchant, related to the Shippens.Charles P.

Jefferson, another wedding guest, dismissed him in 1801 for politicizing his office. Jackson then started a Federalist newspaper, the Political and Commercial Register, in Philadelphia, and edited it until 1815. He was, after his marriage, a leader of society, with Charleston manners, and his father-in-law's wealth; John Adams compared him to Sir Charles Grandison.

Page 60 of the Society of the Cincinnati, a group of former Continental Army officers. On behalf of the remaining officers of the war, he headed an unsuccessful effort to lobby Congress to grant all veteran Revolutionary officers half-pay for life in 1818. Congress was to pass such a bill in 1826, fifty years after independence, but Jackson was not associated with it; his last public appearance was welcoming the Marquis de Lafayette to Philadelphia in 1824. He remained Secretary General of the Cincinnati until his death on December 18, 1828, at the age of 69, in Philadelphia. He is interred in Christ Church Cemetery in Philadelphia, along with his wife.

History Home game consoles may present the player with the opportunity for storing game positions and original user- generated content such as custom game levels. Based on the read-only memory cartridge medium, the premium cost of easy-to-use solid-state data storage technology, such as battery-backed memory, drove the 1980s market to seek cheaper compromises. Utilizing standard compact cassette tapes, Nintendo began with the Famicom Data Recorder. A compatible game runs on cartridge and optionally allows the creation of user-generated content to be saved onto cassette tapes using this tape drive. Manufactured by Matsushita/Panasonic for Nintendo, the cassette tape drive was released in 1984 only in Japan for .

The four or five days of this period are inserted between the last two months of the calendar (Mulk and  ªAl√° º).According to the definition of intercalary days in the Oxford Companion to the Year four of the five days are \\"epagomenal days\\" added to make the number of a calendar's days equal to the number of days in a year, and only the fifth day of Ayy√°m-i-H√° is an intercalary day. The length of Ayy√°m-i-H√° varies according to the timing of the following vernal equinox so that the next year always starts on the vernal equinox. The 2020 dates for this observance are from sunset on Tuesday, February 25, to sunset on Saturday, February 29.Bah√° º√≠ Dates 172 to 221 B.E. (2015‚Äì2065; prepared by the Baha'i World Centre) (pdf) History The B√°b, the founder of the B√°b√≠ Faith, instituted the Bad√≠ ª calendar in the Persian Bay√°n with 19 months of 19 days each and a period of intercalary days to allow for the calendar to be solar. The introduction of intercalation marked an important break from Islam, as under the Islamic calendar the practice of intercalation had been specifically prohibited in the Qur ºan. The B√°b did not, however, specify where the intercalary days should go. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, who claimed to be the one foretold by the B√°b, confirmed and adopted the Badi calendar in the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, his book of laws. He placed the intercalary days before the fasting month of  ªAl√°, the nineteenth and last month, and gave the intercalary days the name \\"Ayy√°m- i-H√°\\" or \\"Days of Ha\\". Prior to 172 B.E. (2015 A.D.), Ayy√°m-i-H√° was from sunset on February 25 to sunset on March 1. Symbolism and celebration The nineteen months of the Bah√° º√≠ calendar are named after the attributes of God. Ayy√°m-i-H√°, which means the \\"Days of H√°\\" ‚Äì H√° is the Arabic letter corresponding to the English H ‚Äì commemorates the transcendence of God over his attributes, since its name \\"H√°\\" has been used as a symbol of the essence of God in the Bah√° º√≠ holy writings.. Under the Arabic abjad system, the letter H√° has the numerical value of five, which is equal to the maximum number of days in Ayyam-i-H√°. During the Festival of Ayy√°m-i-H√° Bah√° º√≠s are encouraged to celebrate God and his oneness by showing love, fellowship and unity. In many instances Bah√° º√≠s give and accept gifts to demonstrate these attributes, and because of this gift giving period, it is sometimes compared to Christmas, but many Baha'is only exchange small gifts because gifts are not the main focus. It is also a time of charity and goodwill and Bah√° º√≠s often participate in various projects of a humanitarian nature.

He guided the church through turbulent changes in the Middle East and rapid expansion in the Western hemisphere. Life He was born George Selim Hakim at Tanta, Egypt, May 18, 1908, to parents who were originally from Aleppo. He was educated locally and at Le Coll√®ge de la Sainte Famille (High School of the Holy Family) Jesuit school in Cairo. After completing his studies at St. Anne of Jerusalem, he was ordained a priest in the Basilica of St. Anne by Maximos IV Sayegh, then Archbishop of Tyre, on July 20, 1930. As a young priest he taught for a year in the patriarchal school in Beirut before returning to Cairo in 1931. Episcopate He was appointed eparch on March 13, 1943 and consecrated Eparch of St. John of Acre, Haifa, Nazareth and all Galilee, in Cairo on June 13, 1943, by Patriarch Cyril IX Moghabghab, assisted by the Archbishops Dionysius Kfoury, Titular bishop of Tarsus dei Greco- Melkiti, and Pierre Medawar, Titular bishop of Pelusium dei Greco-Melkiti, patriarchal auxiliaries. On November 18, 1964 Hakim became Archeparch. He was elected Patriarch by the Holy Synod at Ain Traz on November 22, 1967 and his election was confirmed on November 26 of the same year.catholic-hierarchy.org As a priest, he distinguished himself by his running of the Patriarchal College in Cairo and by the launching and publication of the review Le Lien. Later, as an archbishop, he built schools, a junior seminary, an orphanage, a home for the elderly and several churches. He took particular care for the clergy and for the religious and secular orders and he brought in several groups of Europeans come to integrate themselves into the Church. As archbishop he spearheaded efforts to provide relief for Palestinians during the 1948 exodus. Under his guidance as patriarch, a minor seminary was established at Damascus and later a major seminary for the formation of priests was opened at Raboueh in Lebanon. He later funded numerous scholarships for needy seminarians during the Lebanese Civil War. He also oversaw the growth of the Melkite church in North and South America as many of the faithful emigrated to the West. Maximos condemned the violence that pitted Muslim against Christian in Lebanon, where Greek Catholics constitute 4% of the population. In 1982, he negotiated with Druze leader Walid Jumblatt to safeguard ancient Christian villages in the Chouf valley. He enjoyed warmer ties with the Syrian Baath Regime than the Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, patriarch of the more powerful Maronite Catholic community. Even so, community politics would prove dangerous for him at times. In 1990, he was targeted by would-be assassins as he travelled to the predominantly Christian city of Zahle, located in the predominantly Shi'ite Beq'a valley. Following an old tradition of the more-than-900-year-old Order of Knighthood, founded in Jerusalem to take care of lepers in the Hospital St. Lazare, he was the Spiritual Protector of the international ecumenical Military and Hospitaller Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem, as is his successor. Patriarch Maximos resigned on November 22, 2000, due to failing health, and was succeeded by Patriarch Gregory III Laham. He died on June 29, 2001, in Beirut. 1948 Nakba controversy In the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Hakim negotiated with Yehoshua (\\"Josh\\") Palmon, then leader of the \\"Arab Section\\" in the Israeli Foreign Ministry, for the return of Galilee Christian Arabs (then refugees in Lebanon) in exchange for Hakim's future goodwill towards the Jewish State. In the end, several thousand (including several hundred from Eilabun) Galilee Christians were allowed to return in the summer of 1949.Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press, 2004 p. 480 In the 1950s, while he was archbishop of Galilee, the future patriarch was involved in the fate of the Palestinians of the two depopulated Christian villages of Kafr Bir'im and Iqrit. He alerted the Vatican and other Church authorities about the expulsion of the villagers, and lobbied for their return. A number of sourcesNo solution to the Arab-Palestinian Problem Samuel Katz, 1985 have quoted Maximos V as having said \\"the Arab League had issued orders exhorting the people to seek a temporary refuge in neighboring countries.\\" For example, Israel's Abba Eban told the U.N. Special Political Committee in 1957 that Hakim had said: > The refugees had been confident that their absence from Palestine would not > last long; that they would return within a few days [or] within a week or > two; their leaders had promised them that the Arab armies would crush the > 'Zionist gangs' very quickly and that there would be no need for panic or > fear of a long exile. Joseph Schechtman, in his 1949 publication book The Arab Refugee Problem, quotes Hakim's comment to Karl Baehr, the then Executive Secretary of the American Christian Palestine Committee. Schechtman says of Hakim and his views, > The role played by the British authorities in the Arab mass flight is also > stressed by Monsignor George Hakim, Archbishop of the Greek Catholic Church > (a Uniate Church which is in fellowship with the Vatican and counts 20,864 > adherents in Palestine). An Arab himself and a former supporter of the > Mufti, Archbishop told Baeher... that an important element in precipitating > the flight, particularly in the Haifa area (where Monsignor lives) was \\"the > fact that the British informed the Arabs that they would not protect them. > Since most of the Arab leaders had already fled, the people were thrown into > a panic so they fled by sea to Lebanon. They fled in spite of the fact that > the Jewish authorities guaranteed their safety and rights as citizens of > Israel.\\" Erskine Childers investigated the claims made about Hakim, and in The Spectator of May 12, 1961, published a letter from Hakim addressing them: > There is nothing in this statement to justify the construction which many > propagandists had put on it, namely, that it established the allegation > widely disseminated by partisan sources that the Arab leaders had urged the > Arab inhabitants of Palestine to flee. > > As far as I can recollect, the aforesaid statement was intended to voice the > strong feeling of resentment and revulsion felt by the refugees. They were > convinced by what they had heard and read that the defeat of the Jewish > armed forces, the re-establishment of peace and order throughout the > country, and the institution of Arab rule, would be achieved within a short > time. Instead of such achievements the Arab States had twice agreed to a > truce, and the Arab armies were inactive. Hence the strong feeling of > disappointment and frustration among the file and rank of refugees. > > At no time did I state that the flight of the refugees was due to the > orders, explicit or implicit, of their leaders, military or political, to > leave the country and seek shelter in the adjacent Arab territories.

An American Patriot, he served as the hazzan of Congregation Shearith Israel, New York City's first Spanish and Portuguese synagogue, for about five decades. The first American Jewish clergyman to deliver sermons in English, Mendes Seixas became known for his civic activities as well as his defense of religious liberty, participating in the inauguration of President George Washington and helping found King's College, the precursor of New York City's Columbia University.http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13396-seixas Early and family life Gershon's father, Isaac Mendes Seixas (1709-1780), was a merchant born in Lisbon, Portugal, who first emigrated to Barbados before coming to the British colonies, living in New York City around 1730 and moving to Newport, Rhode Island, around 1765. He married Rachel Levy, who bore seven children, including Gershom. Isaac Mendes Seixas signed the Non- Importation Agreement Act, one of a series of acts of resistance which led to the American Revolutionary War.http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13396-seixas His eldest brother, Moses Mendes Seixas (1744‚Äì1809), a merchant, helped organize the Bank of Rhode Island in 1796, became the president of the historic Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, and led the congregation's welcome for President George Washington. His younger brother Abraham Mendes Seixas (1751‚Äì1799), was an officer in the Continental Army. Another brother, Benjamin Mendes Seixas (1748‚Äì1817), was one of the founders of the New York Stock Exchange. Seixas married Elchalah Cohen (1749-85) in 1775. After her death, he married Hannah Manuel in 1789. In all, he had fifteen children, of whom the most famous would be David Seixas, who established the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb in Philadelphia, and was among the first to discover efficient ways of burning anthracite coal. Career In 1766, Gershom Mendes Seixas became the leader of Shearith Israel, New York City's first and oldest Spanish and Portuguese (Sephardi) congregation, and remained its minister for about a half century. Although not ordained as a rabbi, Seixas served as hazzan and religious leader to the congregation and was among the first leaders of the Jewish community who had been born and educated in the United States. As the British fleet approached New York Bay in August, 1776, Seixas preached an emotional sermon in English, warning that that day's services might be the last held in the historic edifice. His Patriot loyalties provoked Shearith Israel to seal its entrance as the British approached, and Mendes Seixas left New York rather than remain under British rule. He rescued the scrolls of the Law and other ceremonial items as he fled for Stratford, Connecticut, where several members of the congregation joined him. In 1780, patriots who had fled to Philadelphia wanted to establish the city's first permanent congregation and selected Mendes Seixas to officiate. He thus helped establish historic Congregation Mikveh Israel. Many important politicians attended the synagogue's dedication, including the governor of Pennsylvania, and Seixas invoked \\"the blessings of Almighty God on the Members of these States in Congress assembled and on his Excellency George Washington, Commander-General of these Colonies\\".http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13396-seixas While living in Philadelphia, Mendes Seixas zealously defended religious liberty. He and several members of his congregation addressed the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Council of Censors in December 1783, opposing the adoption of a religious test for prospective office holders. He characterized these as \\"unjust to the members of a persuasion that had always been attached to the American cause and given a support to the country, some in the Continental army, some in the militia, and some by cheerfully paying taxes and sustaining the popular cause.\\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13396-seixas Mendes Seixas returned to New York on March 23, 1784, and resumed his former position at the reopened Shearith Israel. He was one of the first ministers to preach a regular Thanksgiving Day sermon.\\"Daily Gazette,\\" Dec. 23, 1789 He was also among the fourteen clergymen honored to be chosen to participate in George Washington's 1789 inauguration ceremony as president of the United States. In 1787 Seixas became the first member of his faith to be elected a trustee of Columbia College in New York City and remained such until 1815. He was also one of the College's incorporators. In 1802, he helped found \\"Hebra Hased Ve Amet\\", charitable organization.http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13396-seixas He served on the Board of Regents of what became New York University and as a trustee of the Humane Society of New York. http://www.amuseum.org/jahf/virtour/page5.html amuseum.org.

An alternate depiction is a cave girl. Description Jungle girls are generally depicted as wearing either a scanty animal print (usually leopard) bikini or some type of jungle dress made from fur, leather, or sometimes vegetation. Most are barefoot, while some are shown in primitive shoes. Some are feral children; some come from a wealthy, educated family who grew up in the jungle. Others come to visit, whether by accident or design, and decide to stay and serve as protectors of the land and local tribes. They are the female counterpart of Tarzanesque characters. They are depicted either as a tough heroine, perhaps a jungle queen, or as a bound and gagged damsel in distress to be rescued by a male, loincloth-wearing hero.  History  A prototypical version of the jungle girl was the ancient but eternally youthful sorceress Ayesha in H. Rider Haggard's She: A History of Adventure (1886). The first forest-dwelling character in fiction was Rima from W. H. Hudson's 1904 novel Green Mansions. One popular character, adapted into various media, is Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, who, though created by American writer-artists Will Eisner and Jerry Iger, made her debut in the British magazine Wags #46 (1937).

It was meant to take the form of a series of short \\"mini-episodes\\" that could be viewed on the official website, however only one episode was released on September 21, 2006, acting as a companion to the Pilot. The episode can only be viewed in the United States. Episode synopsis The first installment of Beyond Jericho began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped. He then disappears underground through a metal trap door. While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it. After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof. When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble. The entire city around them has been destroyed. Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door. With the cell phone (apparently the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened. Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble as the vignette ends. Production and cancellation In an online interview, executive producer Carol Barbee announced that there would be a \\"digital connection\\" to Jericho through an online companion at Jericho's official site with mini-episodes featured on CBS.com's Innertube featuring the \\"other survivors\\" of the nuclear attacks outside of Jericho's primary setting of Jericho, Kansas. According to Barbee, the story was to be unique to the site, but as the season of Jericho continued, it would have dovetailed into the episodes themselves. Beyond Jericho was also promoted via commercial at the end of the first of the TV series episode on CBS. However, the second episode only featured a commercial referencing the opportunity to watch Jericho online. No further episodes of Beyond Jericho have appeared and the link to the first episode is no longer located on CBS's or Jericho's official websites. Countdown Beyond Jericho was replaced by a successor series: Countdown, which documents Robert Hawkins' efforts to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear bombs.

That August, Kelleher switched to guitar and the band placed a classified ad for a bass player in the Irish Voice newspaper. Patrick Clifford (from New York City) answered the ad, was hired, and completed the Kelleher-Yeates- Clifford nucleus that would hold for the remainder of the band's existence. Four to the Bar immediately began to tour regionally. It was during this time that the band gave an opening act for then-rising star Sharon Shannon at the Bog in Jamaica Plain, which brought attention. In 1992, Livingstone abruptly left the band and returned to Ireland. For a number of months, the lead- instrument slot was filled by various fiddlers and mandolin players, most notably Chris Murphy and John Farrell (later of the Prodigals and Fathom). The Heydays: 1993‚Äì1994 In October 1992, Four to the Bar found and retained fiddler Keith O'Neill. Soon after this, the band completed its first commercial recording, a four-song EP and titled simply Four to the Bar (1993). This was available only on cassette. During the next 12 months, the band would begin to build its name in New York, sharing the marquee with acts as diverse as Frank Patterson and Susan McKeown's Chanting House, and begin to test the bounds of the trad repertoire with such covers as Phil Ochs' \\"I Ain't Marching Anymore.\\" Four to the Bar headlined regularly at Tommy Makem's Irish Pavilion and Paddy Reilly's Music Bar, and on one occasion served as Pete Seeger's backing band. Sometime between February and April 1994, Four to the Bar spent time in a Manhattan studio working with a number of fellow musicians, including Seamus Egan, Eileen Ivers, Larry Campbell, Matt Keating, Steve Holley, and Rufus Cappadocia. This project was never commercially released; rough mixes from these sessions apparently circulated as bootlegs through the community, but little else is known about the project. Around the same time, Four to the Bar was experimenting with its sound‚Äîby adding to the lineup, together and separately, accordionist Tony McQuillan and percussionist Seamus Casey. While neither would prove permanent, they both appear on Craic on the Road, the band's first CD release, recorded live on June 16, 1994 and released later that year. The Final Days: 1995‚Äì1996 In early 1995, Four to the Bar bought and borrowed recording equipment, called in engineer Tim Hatfield, and converted a rented dancehall into a recording studio. The five men worked in isolation for three weeks recording, mixing, and mastering, and emerged with Another Son (1995). On the strength of the recording, the band was chosen to perform at the 1995 Daytona International Music Festival, sharing the bill with Trisha Yearwood and the London Symphony Orchestra. The subsequent promotional tour carried the band from Vermont to Key West to St. Louis to Chicago. At some point later that same year, O'Neill resigned; his spot was filled by a series of local freelancers, including Monty Monaghan, Tony DeMarco, John Reynolds, and Joyce Andersen. Classically trained, Andersen brought a cultured sound, but was focused on a solo career and her tenure was brief. On New Year's Eve 1995, Four to the Bar had just started its first set in Dillon's Pub in hometown Woodside, NY, when a fire broke out in an adjoining diner. Each musician managed to save his instrument, but everything else was destroyed. Four to the Bar never fully recovered from the disaster, and despite playing a handful of shows in early 1996, this setback effectively signalled the band's demise.

Biography  Henry of Masovia, born between 1368 and 1370 in Rawa Mazowiecka was the youngest child of one of the Piast dynasty princes of Masovia, Siemowit III of Masovia, and his second wife, the princess of Ziƒôbice, Anna (or Ludmi≈Ça, sources vary). His childhood was rather tragic, as described by several contemporary chroniclers, including Janko z Czarnkowa, although as the facts vary depending on the chronicle, it is assumed parts of that story became dramatised in the years that passed. According to Janko z Czarnkowa, when Anna became pregnant, Siemowit accused her of adultery and imprisoned her in the castle. After the birth of Henry, despite weak evidence, Siemowit ordered his wife strangled and the boy cast away from his court, and raised by a peasant family. After several years, Siemowit's daughter from his first marriage, Margareta, then wife of Casimir IV of Pomerania, decided to rescue her brother and took him to her mansion in S≈Çupsk. Eventually, when Henry was about 10 years old and it became evident he was physically very similar to Siemowit, the latter accepted him back as his son. Siemowit, who had already divided his estates among his other sons in his last will, decided that Henry should become a priest. Nonetheless, possibly driven by feelings of guilt, he convinced his other sons to agree that if Henry would ever abandon the way of priesthood, they would share his inheritance with him. Eventually all indicated that Henry would become a priest. On 30 May 1378, he received a parish in P≈Çock. A few years later Siemowit, who wanted Henry to obtain a parish in ≈Åƒôczyca, became involved in a conflict with the archbishop of Gniezno, Janusz Suchywilk, who had already given that parish to one of his supporters. Siemowit did not accept this and, as the Polish kingdom was weakened and in a state of disarray after the death of the King of Poland (Louis I of Hungary), he took control of the disputed parish with his army and occupied it for several years. On 18 March 1390, Henry, thanks to the efforts of his father and brothers (Janusz I, Duke of Masovia, and Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia), became bishop of P≈Çock, even though he had not received the Holy Orders of priesthood, as required for that position, and refused to accept ordination. In 1391, Henry, who was known both for his incredible strength and his diplomatic skills, accepted a mission from the hands of the king of Poland, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. Jagie≈Ç≈Ço asked him to convince his cousin, Vytautas, who at that time opposed W≈Çadys≈Çaw's rise to power, to distance himself from his allies ‚Äî the Teutonic Knights, enemies of the Kingdom of Poland (and her ally, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). Henry was successful in convincing Vytautas to abandon the Knights (see Ostr√≥w Agreement), and even more, became friends with Vytautas, who decided to marry him off to his sister, Rynga≈Ç≈Ça. The marriage led to many repercussions. Henry, by becoming married, had violated his status in minor orders and this became one of the arguments used by the Teutonic Knights to claim that Lithuania and Poland were not really Christian and, as pagans, could be attacked as enemies of Christianity. Further, Henry died in 1392 or 1393 in ≈Åuck, resulting in controversial claims ‚Äî never verified or disproven ‚Äî that he was assassinated by the Teutonic Knights (in revenge for luring away their ally, Vytautas), by his brothers (who decided not to share his father's inheritance with him once he abandoned the priesthood), or finally by his own wife, Rynga≈Ç≈Ça, who was later proven guilty of murdering her second husband. Henry was buried in the Cathedral of P≈Çock.

China National Highways G106 and G316 in Tongshan County, Hubei Nearly all Chinese expressways and express routes charge tolls, although they are not often networked from one toll expressway to another. However, beginning with the Jingshen Expressway, tolls are gradually being networked. Given the size of the nation, however, the task is rather difficult. China National Highways, which are not expressways, but \\"grade-A\\" routes, also charge tolls. Some provincial, autonomous-regional and municipal routes, as well as some major bridges, will also charge passage fees. In November 2004, legislation in China provided for a minimum length of a stretch of road or expressway in order for tolls to be charged. Hong Kong In Hong Kong, most tunnels and some bridges that form part of the motorway networks are tolled to cover construction and maintenance costs. Some built recently are managed in the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis. The companies which build the tunnels or bridges are given franchise of a certain length of time (usually 30 years) to operate. Ownership will be transferred to the government when the franchise expires. An example is the Cross Harbour Tunnel.  India Mumbai-Pune Expressway, India Access-controlled roads in India are tolled. In addition to cash tolls, toll plazas have dedicated electronic toll collection lanes for quicker operation. In addition, most of the upgraded sections of the National Highway network are also tolled. These tolls are lower than those on expressways. Currently, a massive project is underway to expand the highway network and the Government of India plans to add an additional of expressways to the network by the year 2022.Govt plans to build 18637 km expressways  Indonesia  Further information: List of toll roads in Indonesia KM 36 of Jakarta‚ÄìCikampek Toll Road. Indonesia opened its first toll road, the Jagorawi Toll Road, in 1978. This linked the capital city of Jakarta to the neighboring cities of Bogor and Ciawi south of the capital. Today, the system is still limited in its existence, as major toll routes remain in and around the major cities of Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, and Semarang. Recently, development in inter‚Äìcity routes has increased. In 2005, the Cipularang Toll Road connecting Bandung in West Java to Jakarta was completed. This is a major development for the Indonesian transport system, as a drive between Jakarta and Bandung can now be completed in just under 3 hours. In 2015, the Cikampek‚ÄìPalimanan Toll Road connecting Jakarta and Cirebon in West Java was completed. This is another major development as this Toll Road connects Jakarta‚ÄìCikampek Toll Road and Palimanan‚ÄìKanci Toll Road, and a drive between Jakarta and Central Java using this Toll Road can now be completed around 4 hours. Indonesia had 34 toll roads until October 2015 : North Sumatra : Belmera, connecting North Sumatra.

Israel Israeli toll road sign, showing the Israeli new sheqel symbol: ‚Ç™ Highway 6 in Israel, widely known as the Trans-Israel Highway or Cross-Israel Highway, is to date the only electronic toll highway in Israel. Currently Highway 6 is 110 km long, all of which is a freeway. This figure will grow in the next few years as additional segments, currently undergoing statutory approvals and permitting processes, are added to the main section of the road. Highway 6 uses a system of cameras and transponders to toll vehicles automatically. There are no toll booths, allowing Highway 6 to be designed as a normal freeway with interchanges.  Japan  The vast majority of Japan's extensive expressway consists of toll roads. Payment of the fare can either be made in cash as one exits or using the electronic toll collection card system. As of 2001 the toll fees for an ordinary passenger car was 24.60 yen per kilometre plus a 150 yen terminal charge.  Malaysia  Malaysia has extensive toll roads that forms the majority of country's expressways which in length spans more than 1400 km ranging North to the Thai border, South to the Causeway and Second Link to Singapore, West to Klang and Pulau Indah and East towards Kuantan. Most of the toll roads are in major cities and conurbations such as Klang Valley, Johor Bahru and Penang. All of Malaysian toll roads are managed in the Build-Operate-Transfer basis as in Hong Kong and Japan (see below). Pakistan All motorways and few expressways are toll roads. First such motorway M2 was opened to public in 1997. Since then the M3, M9, M10, and M1, all toll roads, have become operational. The M8 is under construction.

It begins at Rizal Highway in Hermosa, Bataan and ends at Subic Freeport Zone/SBMA at Olongapo, Zambales. The 4 km Muntinlupa‚ÄìCavite Expressway, which is also known as MCX and formerly Daang Hari-SLEX Link Expressway is a long access-controlled toll expressway linking the southern province of Cavite to Muntinlupa in the Philippines. The east end is the SLEX in Muntinlupa and the west end is at Daang Hari and Daang Reyna Road junction in Cavite. The 11.6 kilometer NAIA Expressway is an elevated expressway that runs from the Metro Manila Skyway to Jose Diokno Boulevard, and Ninoy Aquino Avenue and NAIA Road near Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3. This elevated expressway project is divided into 4 packages. This is also the first airport expressway in the Philippines. It is located in Pasay and Para√±aque, and a little portion in Taguig. Only the North Luzon Expressway, Subic‚ÄìClark‚ÄìTarlac Expressway, and the South Luzon Expressway (including the Skyway) have an electronic toll collection system, which is based on the 5.7 GHz standard.  Singapore  Further information: Singapore Area Licensing Scheme, Electronic Road Pricing In Singapore, toll stations are automated, thus reducing manpower. The automated toll stations, also known to the locals as ERP or Electronic Road Pricing, was introduced by Land Transport Authority (LTA) to reduce city traffic jams. Although it is advanced, it is still unpopular among Singaporean drivers. The number of toll stations is increasing rapidly and some Singaporeans even call it \\"Every road pay\\".  Sri Lanka  Sri Lanka currently operates 2 toll roads. The Southern Expressway (E 01) and the Katunayake Expressway (E 03). The Kandy Colombo Expressway (E 02) is under planning at the moment (2013). The toll revenue is used to repair and maintain the expressways.  Taiwan A typical toll booth notification sign in Taiwan Taiwanese Toll Booth Sign off freeways meaning: stop the vehicle to pay toll Freeways in Taiwan are not exactly toll roads in the sense that toll gates/stations are not located at the entrance and exits of the freeway. Toll stations with weigh stations are located every thirty to forty kilometres on the No. 1 and No. 3 National Freeways of the Republic of China. There are usually no freeway exits once a toll station notification sign appears, making it necessary for the driver to be familiar with the locations of the toll stations in advance. See Highway System in Taiwan#Toll station for more detailed information. Other toll roads in Taiwan are usually newly built bridges and tunnels. Tolls are frequently collected to pay off the construction cost and once paid off, the tolls may be repealed.  Tajikistan  Toll roads in Tajikistan are owned and operated by Innovative Road Solutions (IRS). The northern point is in the Sughd Viloyat and the Southern point ends at Kurgan Tyube (100 km south of the capital of the country - Dushanbe). While going from end to end costs roughly $12 US Dollars for regular 2 axle vehicles, it can top to $100 for semitrucks. The IRS is setting up new toll plazas that are going to be able to read off the digital device attached to windshield while passing through at the speed of no more than 15 km/h, similar to ones in the United States. This is the only toll road in the entire Central Asia with about 5 cars going through each toll plaza every minute in every direction. The more information can be found on their homepage at www.IRS.tj  Thailand  Most of the toll roads in Thailand are either within Greater Bangkok or originated from Bangkok. They are called expressways, tollways, and motorways. Two government agencies under the Ministry of Transport, namely the Expressway Authority of Thailand (EXAT) and the Department of Highways (DoH), own networks of toll roads. Some are operated by the agencies themselves; others are operated by private concessionaires. EXAT is in charge of Chaloem Mahanakhon Expressway, Si Rat Expressway, Chalong Rat Expressway, Udon Ratthaya Expressway, Burapha Withi Expressway and Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road (southern section). DoH is in charge of Uttraphimuk Tollway (formerly Don Mueang Tollway), Motorway No. 7 (Bangkok-Chonburi), and Motorway No. 9 (Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road - eastern section). Both agencies have plans to build more toll roads in the future, expanding their networks to the provinces. Electronic Toll Collection using passive RFID tags is used in Chaloem Mahanakhon, Si Rat, Chalong Rat, and Burapha Withi Expressway while Uttraphimuk Tollway employs passive IC- card-based Touch-and-Go system. There are plans to upgrade and expand ETC systems in the near future.  United Arab Emirates  The toll system Salik started in Dubai in July 2007.  Africa  Morocco Casablanca‚ÄìRabat expressway Morocco has an extensive system of toll roads or Autoroutes. These were for the most part recently built, and from Casablanca connect all of Moroccos major cities such as Marrakech, Rabat, and Tangier. Operator Autoroutes Du Maroc runs the network on a pay-per-use basis, with toll stations placed along its length. Goal is completing a North-South and an East-West link crossing the country. Both axis will be important sections of the Pan-African main links.Moroccan operator ADM'sYear 2007 report , PDF file, downloaded 22 August 2008 Mozambique The Mozambique South Africa Tollway was established in 2014 and is run by private contractors leasing the highway from the Mozambican Government and tolls will be established on many other important paved roads in Mozambique South Africa In South Africa many of the National routes have sections that are toll roads. In cities such as Cape Town and Durban the freeways are free of charge. However, with the introduction of electronic tolling (e-tolls) as part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project, tolls were introduced on the upgraded the urban freeways that are National Roads in the province of Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria. These Gauteng tolls met resistance in the media and from parts of the population. Toll roads are run by the South African National Roads Agency Limited or in the case of routes like the N3 and N4, by concessionaires. Zimbabwe In 2013 the Ntabazinduna Toll Plaza was opened outside of Bulawayo and the toll system was introduced by a South African Group named Group Five as part of a government project to provide safer highways and to also benefit the local community and also the local economy. Additionially eight more toll plazas will be operating in Zimbabwe.  Europe  Toll roads in Europe have a long history. The first turnpike road in England was authorised in the seventeenth century. The term turnpike refers to a gate on which sharp pikes would be fixed as a defence against cavalry. Early references include the (mythical) Greek ferryman Charon charging a toll to ferry (dead) people across the river Acheron. Germanic tribes charged tolls to travellers across mountain passes. Tolls were used in the Holy Roman Empire in the 14th century and 15th century. In some European countries payment of road tolls is made using stickers which are affixed to the windscreen. Germany uses a system based on satellite technology for large vehicles. In other countries payment may be made in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card or by an electronic toll collection system. Tolls may vary according to the distance travelled, the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle. Some of these toll roads are privately owned and operated. Others are owned by the government. Some of the government-owned toll roads are privately operated.  Belarus  Major highways in Belarus are toll roads with Open road tolling (ORT) or free-flow tolling. BelToll is an electronic toll collection system (ETC), valid from 1 July 2013 in the Republic of Belarus.  Croatia  A1 motorway near Trogir. Almost all Croatian highways are toll roads with the exception of the Zagreb bypass and Rijeka bypass. Most of the highways feature a closed toll collection system. Tolls are usually calculated according to the basic formula of 0,40 kn/km, multiplied by a factor according to the vehicle category. There are four vehicle categories in Croatia: # two-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the front axle, including motorcycles # three and multi-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans # vehicles more than 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans with trailers # same as the 3rd class, but at least four axles At some motorways, the motorcycles are classified as a separate category and charged less than two-axle vehicles. Each class of vehicles pays approximately 1,5 times the toll paid by the previous class. The length and the exact toll for a highway section can be found at the official website of Croatian highway authority.Hrvatske autoceste (HAC) - Croatian highway authority If a highway features an open toll collection system, the toll for the whole highway is paid at a mainline plaza. Such toll collection attracts the shunpikers. There are four Croatian companies that build and maintain highways and collect tolls: * Hrvatske autoceste (Croatian Motorways Ltd) * Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj (Zagreb - Macelj Motorway) * Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb (Rijeka - Zagreb Motorway) * BINA Istra  Denmark  The Great Belt Fixed Link the √òresund Bridge and Fjord Link Frederikssund (Crown Princess Mary's Bridge) are toll roads. In the Faroe Islands, the inter-island road tunnels V√°gatunnilin and Nor√∞oyatunnilin both have tolls (but no physical toll booths are present and the toll must be paid at nearby petrol stations).  France  A typical French autoroute. In Europe, the most substantial use of toll roads is in France, where most of the autoroutes carry quite heavy tolls. In a number of countries the companies have often fallen in and out of the public sector, and many have had financial problems.  Iceland  The Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur Tunnel was tolled from 11 July 1998 but became toll free as of 28 September 2018. Today the Va√∞lahei√∞arg√∂ng is the only tunnels you have to pay toll, it was opened in December of 2018.  Ireland  The Republic of Ireland has three toll roads, three toll bridges, and two toll tunnels, which are operated by various independent operators. Most were built under a public-private partnership system, giving the company which arranged for the road to be built the right to collect tolls for a defined period. Tolls vary from ‚Ç¨1.65 to ‚Ç¨12 for cars.  Italy  Most Italian motorways are toll roads, with some exceptions such as some motorways in Southern Italy and Sicily or the Grande Raccordo Anulare (Rome's ring road). In most motorways, toll is proportional to the distance traveled and has to be paid on exit, where toll gates ‚Äî caselli ‚Äî are placed. On other motorways, however, toll gates are placed directly along the route ‚Äî barriere ‚Äî. In such cases, it is required to pay a fixed amount, regardless of the distance traveled. A8, A9, A52 are good examples of that system. Toll can be paid in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card, or by Telepass. 61% of the Italian motorways are handled by the \\"Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A.\\" company, and its subsidiaries. All of these carriers are now privately owned and supervised by ANAS. The network of motorways covers most of Italy: northern and central Italy are well covered, the south and Sicily are scarcely covered, Sardinia is not covered at all. The motorway operators are required to build, operate and maintain their networks at cost and to cover their expenses from the toll they collect. The tolls vary according to the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle. Besides the motorways, only some alpine tunnels (such as the Mont Blanc Tunnel) are tolled. Today, no toll is required on other roads, including motorway-like dual carriageways ‚Äî superstrade. The first tolled superstrada is under construction now north of Venice.  The Netherlands  In the beginning of the 20th century, almost all communities collected toll on all passing traffic, usually including pedestrians and livestock. In 1953, the central government abolished all communal tolls. As of 2008, there are three effective toll roads in Netherlands. They are for the Western Scheldt Tunnel, Kil tunnel, both major arteries, and the \\"Tolbrug\\" (Toll Bridge) in Nieuwerbrug, a local hand-drawn bridge. Also, for the Wijkertunnel, a \\"shadow toll\\" is paid by Rijkswaterstaat for each passed vehicle.  Norway  Norwegian toll road sign Norway has extensively been using toll as a way to finance road infrastructure in the last decades. The toll is called \\"bompenger\\" (gate coin) which from comes the first toll roads in Norway, private roads where owners were allowed to charge traffic. The toll ends when the road has been paid off. There are also toll rings around some cities, where drivers have to pay to enter or leave the city, regardless of if the road is new or old. The first city was Bergen in 1986. The money goes to construction of infrastructure in and around the city.  Poland  Toll plazas in Poland There are three toll highways in Poland, connecting the major cities and the nation's boundaries. Two routes travel east‚Äìwest, one running between ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and the German border, the other currently connecting Katowice and Krak√≥w, with current construction extending the roads to the German and Ukrainian boundaries. A north‚Äìsouth route connects Rybnik to Katowice, and Torun to Gda≈Ñsk.  Portugal  In Portugal a certain number of roads are designated Toll-Roads. They charge a fixed value per kilometre distance, with several classes depending on vehicle type and regulated by the government. Several authorised franchises run them, the largest at present being BRISA. For cash-free payments there exists the Via Verde, an electronic toll collection system. On leaving the motorway, charges are automatically debited from a bank account.  Russia  A number of toll roads in Barnaul and Pskov Region (Nevil-Velezh (RUR 190 ($8)), Pechori-state border RUR 140), also M4-Don (18 km close to Lipetsk costs RUR20($0,75) for cars and RUR40 ($1,7) for trucks). Overall toll network is 383 km or 0,05% of total road network. Average price in Pskov region having 226 km of toll roads is RUR 2,4-5,5 per km for cars, and RUR 7,9-19,5 for trucks. This comes close to $0,5 per km for trucks. Ordinary speed limits apply so far. In 2007 adopted Toll Road Law and Concession Law in 2005 to develop this sector.  Slovenia  For the use of 464,7 km of the Slovenian freeways and expressways use of toll stickers is obligatory for all vehicles with the permissible maximum weight of 3.5 tons on motorways and expressways as of July 1, 2008. The sticker costs are ‚Ç¨15 for 7 days, ‚Ç¨30 for a month and ‚Ç¨95 for a year. Motorcyclists have to pay ‚Ç¨7.50 for 7 days, ‚Ç¨25 for a half year and ‚Ç¨47.50 for a year.Vignette prices on DARS.si Trucks use existing toll road stops.Cestnina v Sloveniji Use of highways and expressways without a valid and properly displayed sticker in a vehicle is a violation of the law and is punished with a fine of ‚Ç¨300 or more. Due to the high costs of toll stickers for transit drivers going to vacation to Croatian and Montenegrin coast and others only passing through Slovenia, the highways are avoided by some travellers. Brussels had opened the case with the statement that the Slovenian vignette violates prevailing EU rights and discriminates road users. The European commissioner for traffic and transport, Antonio Tajani, had investigated in the case of discrimination.Split-Guide, Dalmatien Travelguide On 28 January 2010, after short-term vignettas were introduced by Slovenia and some other changes were made to the Slovenian vignette system, the European Commission concluded that the vignette system is in accordance with the European law.  Spain  Most Spanish toll roads are networked, so you must get a ticket on entering and pay when leaving the road. Technically, all roads belong to the Government, although toll roads are built and maintained by private companies under a State concession; when the concession expires, the road is reverted to State ownership, however most of then are renewed. Toll roads are called in Spanish autopistas. Freeways, often comparable to autopistas in building and ride quality, are called autov√≠as. There are some autov√≠as which are actually built and maintained by private companies, such as Pamplona-Logro√±o A-12Navarra.es Navarran Autonomous Community news bulletin, February 5 2007Noticias de Navarra, May 2005 or Madrid access road M45.El Pa√≠s, August 8 2005 The company assumes the building costs and the Autonomous Community where they are located (in the given examples, Navarre and Madrid) pays a yearly per-vehicle fee to the company based upon usage statistics, called \\"shadow toll\\" (in Spanish, peaje en la sombra).Capital Madrid, march 30 2007 The system can be regarded as a way for the Government to finance the build of new roads at the expense of the building company. Also, since the payment starts only after the road is finished, construction delays are usually shorter than those of regular state-owned freeways. However, those cannot be classified as toll roads since drivers do not need to pay any fees.  Sweden  Swedish toll road sign The border-crossing The Oresund Bridge and Svinesund Bridge have tolls. The Stockholm and Gothenburg City areas have congestion pricing on entry. The Sundsvall Bridge is a proper toll bridge. Before the year 2000 road tolls did not exist in Sweden for several decades.  Switzerland  A2 motorway in Ticino, suspended over viaducts For the use of Swiss motorways the use of toll stickers is obligatory. They costs CHF 40 per year per vehicle (a car towing a trailer needs two stickers). There are no stickers for shorter periods and they are valid 14 months (the 2010 sticker is valid from 1 December 2009 until 31 January 2011). However, this also means that a sticker bought any time during the year can only be used for less than the maximum period until January 31 of the following year.  Republic of Turkey  In the Republic of Turkey toll is collected on certain highways, the so-called Otoyollarƒ± or Karayollarƒ±. This is done so by three different systems. Every toll road has lanes for all three payment methods. One method is KGS (Kartlƒ± Ge√ßi≈ü Sistemi) (English: Card passage system) which requires a Prepaid card to be presented at the toll port. Every passing will be withdrawn from the card. Another method is HGS (Hƒ±zlƒ± Ge√ßi≈ü Sistemi) (English: Fast passage system.) which uses a RFID chip stuck to the windshield of the vehicle. This chip is scanned automatically when passing the toll collecting point and money will be automatically withdrawn from the connected bank account. The last system is OGS which is calles Otomatik Ge√ßi≈ü Sistemi in Turkish, and translates Automatic passage system in English. This form of payment requires a fixed amount of money to be paid for a monthly or annual subscription. When subscribed, your car will be equipped with a barcoded sticker, which will be checked by CCTV cameras automatically to check if the car is actually subscribed. The Turkish toll system can't be avoided (except for avoiding toll roads), because one can simply not pass KGS without the required card, and due to the cameras, all cars passing OGS and HGS with no or expired or counterfied chips or stickers will get a fine nicely presented at their home address.  United Kingdom  M6 Toll plaza for northbound traffic at Great Wyrley Road rates were introduced in England in the seventeenth century. The first turnpike road, whereby travellers paid tolls to be used for road upkeep, was authorised in 1663 for a section of the Great North Road in Hertfordshire. The first turnpike trust was established by Parliament through a Turnpike Act in 1706. From 1751 until 1772 there was a flurry of interest in turnpike trusts and a further 390 were established. By 1825 over 1,000 trusts controlled 25,000 miles (40,000 km) of road in England and Wales. The rise of railway transport largely halted the improving schemes of the turnpike trusts. Unable to earn sufficient revenue from tolls alone the trusts took to requiring taxes from the local parishes. The system was never properly reformed but from the 1870s Parliament stopped renewing the acts and roads began to revert to local authorities, the last trust vanishing in 1895. The Local Government Act 1888 created county councils and gave them responsibility for maintaining the major roads. There are still a small number of toll bridges left including Swinford toll bridge near Oxford. Most UK roads today are maintained from general taxation, some of which is raised from motoring taxes including fuel duty and vehicle excise duty. Today, there are few tolls on roads in the United Kingdom - mainly toll bridges and tunnels. Until recently there were only two toll roads to which there is a public right of way (Rye Road in Stanstead Abbotts and College Road in Dulwich) together with another five or so private toll-roads. The M6 Toll motorway to the north of Birmingham levies a usage charge.  North and South America   Brazil  In Brazil, toll roads are a recent institution, and were adopted mostly in non-federal highways. The state of S√£o Paulo has the highest length of toll roads, which are exploited either by private companies which bought a concession from the state, or by a state owned company (see Highway system of S√£o Paulo). In S√£o Paulo there is also a statewide electronic collection system using a plastic transponder (e-tag) attached to the windscreen, named SemParar'. There is a growing trend towards tolling in all major highways of the country, but some resistance by the population is beginning to be felt, particularly due to some abuses which are being imposed, restricting the constitutional rights of coming and going (because the Brazilian highway system has very few non-tolled vicinal roads in parallel to highways) and making some trips an extremely expensive affair, as compared to average Brazilian earning power (in S√£o Paulo, a 1,000 km round trip may cost upward of two hundreds Brazilian real in some roads, higher than petrol expenses).  Canada  Most tolled roadways in Canada are bridges to the United States, although a few domestic bridges in some provinces have tolls. Toll highways disappeared, for the most part, in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, political pressure dropped the new tolls on an upgraded section of the Trans- Canada Highway in New Brunswick. Highway 407 in the Greater Toronto Area is a modern toll route and does not have collection booths but an overhead sensor. It's heavily criticized as the government leased it for 99 years with the company having unlimited control of the highway and tolls so it is expensive, but still a necessity for gridlocked Toronto. Nova Scotia has a toll highway on the Trans Canada Highway between Debert and Oxford.  Colombia  Many highways in Colombia charge tolls. Motorcycles are allowed to bypass for free.  Ecuador  The Pan-American Highway in Ecuador charges tolls. Motorcycles pay a reduced fare.  Mexico Mexico has an extensive system of toll roads or Autopistas. Autopistas are built and funded by Federal taxes and are built to nearly identical standards as the US Interstate Highways System. Also, many states in Mexico have their own toll roads such as Puebla, Veracruz and Nuevo Le√≥n. All federal toll highways operate with 3 payment options, cash, credit card and electronic tag IAVE. IAVE in all the highways is operated by Caminos y Puentes Federales (CAPUFE).  Panama  Most of the toll roads in Panama were built in the mid 1990s, with the exception of the Arraijan-Chorrerra Highway. The three modern toll roads were built after the transportation plan made by the Government of Japan in the mid 1980s using the BOT formula. This highways are the Corredor Norte in the north of the Panama City, and the Corredor Sur in the south. Another highway was built and is the Panama-Colon Highway.  Puerto Rico  There are several toll roads in Puerto Rico, where toll roads are called \\"autopista\\" (which loosely translates to \\"car track\\") and toll houses are called \\"peaje\\".  United States  Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound, approaching Pittsburgh interchange with I-376/US 22. Dallas North Tollway just north of the Northwest Highway A toll road in the United States, especially near the east coast, is often called a turnpike. The term turnpike originated from the turnstile or gate which blocked passage until the fare was paid at a toll house (or toll booth in current terminology). Most tolled facilities in the US today use an electronic toll collection system as an alternative to paying cash. Examples of this are the E-ZPass system used on most toll bridges and toll roads in the eastern U.S. from North Carolina to Maine and Illinois; Houston's EZ Tag, which also works in other parts of the state of Texas, Oklahoma's Pikepass (which also works in Texas and Kansas), California's FasTrak, Illinois' I-Pass, and Florida's SunPass. Toll roads are only in 26 states as of 2006. The majority of states without any turnpikes are in the West and South. After a halt in toll road construction following the establishment of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, many states are going back to implementing tolls to fund capital improvements and manage congestion. This is because the cost of expanding and maintaining the highway network is increasing faster than the amount of revenue that can be generated by the federal gasoline tax for the Highway Trust Fund. Years after abolishing tolls, Kentucky and Connecticut have both re-examinined the possibility of reinstating tolls on some highways, while several other states are advancing the construction of new toll roads to supplement their existing networks of toll-free expressways.  Oceania   Australia  In Australia, a small number of motorways have been tolled due to cover the expense of their construction. Such roads can be found in the Australian cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. There are no toll roads in the Australian states of South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania or any of the mainland territories. Toll collection is by electronic toll collection; there are no longer any cash booths in Australia. In Brisbane, there are three tollway operators (Brisbane City Council, Queensland Motorways, and RiverCity Motorway). Brisbane City Council owns and operates the Go Between Bridge over the Brisbane River in the city. Queensland Motorways operates the tolls on the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges, and another two on the Logan Motorway on the south side. RiverCity Motorway operates the Clem Jones Tunnel, which runs underneath the city between the inner southern and northern suburbs. All toll collection points are electronically operated. Another company, BrisConnections, is currently constructing another toll tunnel (the longest tunnel in Australia) called the Airport Link, and will allow traffic to flow from the northern Clem Jones - Inner City Bypass interchange, direct to Brisbane Airport. Construction is due to be complete in 2012. International Travellers and people that are new to Brisbane should note, the penalty for non payment of tolls is in excess of $140 (per trip). It is best to avoid toll roads at all costs as it really saves little time and is often classed by the general Brisbane public as \\"revenue raising\\". In Melbourne, there are two companies that operate tollways within the Melbourne metropolitan area. Transurban operates CityLink covering sections of the Monash Freeway, Southern Link, Western Link and the upgraded sections of the Tullamarine Freeway. ConnectEast operates EastLink that runs through the Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne. All Melbourne tollways are electronically tolled. The West Gate Bridge opened as a toll bridge upon its completion in 1978, however the toll was abolished in 1985. In Sydney, many of the motorways contain at least one tolled section with a mixture of government and private ownership. The State Government owns the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel, while the M2 Motorway, M4 Motorway, M5 Motorway, Eastern Distributor, Westlink M7 and Lane Cove Tunnel are privately operated by a variety of companies such as Macquarie Infrastructure, Transurban, and to a lesser extent Industry Super funds such as Retail Employees Super, SunSuper, and the Industry Funds Management which partly own the M5 motorway in South Western Sydney. As well as the tolled motorways, the Cross City Tunnel - an east‚Äìwest route underneath the Sydney CBD - was opened to traffic in 2005. This road has become somewhat controversial due to the relatively high toll charge and the closure of surrounding roads designed to funnel traffic through the tunnel. All Sydney tollways accept E-tags; the Westlink M7, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Cross City Tunnel, Lane Cove Tunnel and from 1 December 2007 on the M2 Motorway have no cash booths, just E-Tag readers to zoom on through as they charge their tolls only through electronic tolling methods or through the use of number plate reading as you go through, then you have to pay after a certain time frame (for example; before 24 hours), otherwise you will get a fine in the mail. The M5 Motorway moved to electronic only tolling in 2013. Tolls on the M4 Motorway were abolished in 2010. An E-Tag is an RFID device that allow a driver to pass through a toll point without physically stopping. When a vehicle fitted with an E-Tag passes through a toll collection point, the E-Tag identifies the electronic account of the vehicle passing through and the toll-road operator recovers the toll via that account. There are four providers of E-tag accounts in New South Wales (RTA, RoamTag, Interlink Roads, and M2 Consortium). All tags provided by these four providers can be used on every E-Tag-enabled tollway in Australia.  New Zealand  * Auckland Harbour Bridge was opened in 1959 and operated as a toll bridge until 1984. In the 1960s a group of university students attempted to disrupt the toll system by repeatedly crossing the bridge using motor-scooters (to which a very low toll applied), and paying their toll in ¬£5 notes; the hope was that they would exhaust the supplies of change held at the toll booths. However, the toll authority got wind of their plans and got a very large supply of small change (copper coinage), so the students were soon weighed down with large amounts of small change. * The Lyttelton Road Tunnel, linking the City of Christchurch with the harbour at Lyttelton, was originally a Toll Tunnel built in 1962. The government of the day promised that as soon as the tunnel was paid for, the toll would be removed The promise was kept, and the toll was removed in the mid-1970s once the tunnel had been paid off. The Tunnel Authority building and toll booths are still there at the Heathcote end. * The City of Tauranga operates a toll road running between the outlying settlement of Tauriko on State Highway 2 and central business district of the city. This toll road also act as a feeder route for the Tauranga Harbour Bridge. Tolls are collected by staff operating tollbooths at the western end of the road. * The Northern Gateway Toll Road is a 7.5 km motorway extension to State Highway 1 just north of Auckland. Northbound, the toll road begins just before Orewa and ends via a pair of road tunnels through the Johnstone Hills near Puhoi. The toll road opened in January 2009 and gives motorists a choice between a more direct route or State Highway 17 via Orewa. Tolling is implemented through automatic vehicle license plate reading with cameras in an overhead gantry.

The act began in 1979 by Chuck and Lou Ann Best and started with an appearance on Real People. It has been featured on numerous television shows, newspaper articles, and websites. The Bests live in Sanford, Florida. They found an orphaned squirrel after Hurricane David and raised it as a family pet who would ride on their shoulders even as they dipped in the pool. Having purchased a remote-controlled boat for his daughter, Chuck demurred handing over the controls, joking that he had to teach Twiggy to water-ski; the joke was soon taken seriously, albeit with no initial intent of publicity. Twiggy is actually several gray squirrels who have been trained in succession. The retired squirrels live out their lives as family pets. The squirrels are trained to ride on buoyant foam blocks, which are then towed behind a remote-controlled boat.

The publication was an important tool for the political movement led by Gandhi and the Natal Indian Congress to fight racial discrimination and win civil rights for the Indian immigrant community in South Africa. It existed between 1904 and 1915. History Through the 19th century Indians were brought to South Africa as indentured labour by the authorities of the British Empire, which governed both South Africa and India. Alongside various multi-ethnic communities, the Indian community suffered from significant political, economic and social discrimination, administered by the system of apartheid. In the aftermath of the Boer War, the government of General Jan Smuts introduced significant restrictions on the civil rights of the Indian immigrant community, giving the police power to warrantless search, seizures and arrests. All Indians were required to carry identification and registration cards at all times. Working as a lawyer in the Natal province, Gandhi organized the publication in 1904 with the aim of educating European communities in South Africa about Indian needs and issues. With the support of the Natal Indian Congress, his clients and other notable Indians, Gandhi assembled a small staff and printing press. Madanjit Viyavaharik, the owner of the International Printing Press and The first issue was prepared through 4 June and 5 June, and released on 6 June 1903. The newspaper was published in Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil and English. Mansukhlal Nazar, the secretary of the Natal Congress served as its editor and a key organiser. In 1904, Gandhi relocated the publishing office to his settlement in Phoenix, located close to Durban. At Phoenix, the press workers were governed by a new work ethic - they would all have a share in the land, in the profits if there were any, they would grow crops to sustain themselves and they would work jointly to produce Indian Opinion. The newspaper's editors included Hebert Kitchin, Henry Polak, Albert West, Manilal Gandhi, who was the paper's longest serving editor (for 36 years), and Sushila Gandhi, wife of Manilal who took over after his death. All but one of its editors spent some time in jail. Reports The Indian Opinion began by adopting a very moderate tone, reiterating its faith in British law and seeking not to provoke the hostility of British officials. However, the Indian Opinion especially highlighted the poor conditions under which indentured labourers worked. Editorials tackled the discrimination and harsh conditions prevalent in the agricultural estates where indentured Indians were employed. Cases of harsh treatment by employers were publicized and the astoundingly high rate of suicide amongst Indians was pointed out. A campaign to end the system was launched and editor Henry Polak, a friend of Gandhi's, went to India to mobilise support. From 1906 onwards it became a vehicle for challenging state laws and urging defiance of these when these were clearly unjust. This tradition began during the satyagraha campaign between 1906 and 1913 which began because of attempts to impose passes on Indians in the Transvaal. The paper played a fundamental role on defeating the registration drive of officials. Its pages paid tribute to local resisters and Brian Gabriel, one of Natal's earliest Indian photographers, provided visual coverage. Legacy The Indian Opinion was a means of bringing news about Indians in the colonies before the public in India. The pages of Indian Opinion provide a valuable historical record of the disabilities that Indians suffered under. It also provides an invaluable record of the political life of the Indian community. Gandhi's experience with the publication and the political struggle in South Africa proved a major experience for him that helped him in his work for the Indian independence movement. He commented \\"Satyagraha would have been impossible without Indian Opinion.\\" In India, he would publish Young India, Harijan, and Navjivan. Indian Opinion continued to publish for many decades and played a significant role in the wider civil rights struggle of South Africa. But it also suffered from not being a commercial enterprise but rather a publication committed to serving social causes. See also *Gandhi Heritage Portal References *M. K. Gandhi.

It included a major battle at Ciudad Mier on December 26 and 27, 1842, which the Mexicans won. The Texian attack was launched partly in hopes of financial gain and partly in retaliation for the Dawson Massacre (as named by Texans) earlier that year, in which thirty-six Texas militia were killed by the Mexican Army. Both conflicts were part of continuing efforts by each side to control the land between the Rio Grande and Nueces River. The Republic of Texas believed that this territory had been ceded to it in the Treaties of Velasco, by which they gained independence; but Mexico did not agree. Background Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, the ruler of Mexico, was defeated by Texians at the Battle of San Jacinto and signed the Treaties of Velasco in 1836, ceding Texas territory from Mexican control (these treaties had not been ratified by the Mexican legislature). But, his forces continued to invade the Republic of Texas with the goal of regaining control, particularly of the territory between the Rio Grande and Nueces River. Texas had hardly any settlements there. On September 17, 1842,Lord, George. The Mier Expedition . (From clippings from the Cuero Star, Cuero, Texas (1883) and present in the Valentine Bennet Scrapbook by Miles S. Bennet, Center for American History, University of Texas, Austin). Retrieved June 21, 2014. Texian and Mexican forces engaged at Salado Creek, east of San Antonio. After a separate favorable Texian engagement earlier in the day, a reinforcement company of 54 Texas militia, mostly from Fayette County, under the command of Nicholas Mosby Dawson, began advancing on the rear of the Mexican Army. The Mexican commander, General Adri√°n Woll, sent 500 of his cavalrymen and two cannons to attack the group. The Texians held their own against the Mexican soldiers, but their fatalities mounted after the cannons came within range. The battle lasted just over an hour, resulting in 36 Texians dead and 15 captured in what Texans called the Dawson Massacre. Expeditions On November 25, 1842, Alexander Somervell, a Texan customs officer from Matagorda Island, left San Antonio with 700 men under his command on a military expedition to punish the Mexican Army for raids in Texas. The Somervell Expedition recaptured Laredo on December 7, 1842, and then, with a reduced force of 500, took the Mexican town of Guerrero. Lacking serious backing for the expedition from the Republic of Texas, Somervell ordered his men to disband and return home on December 19, 1842. Five captains and their men disobeyed, initiating the privateer Mier Expedition. More men were gathered at La Grange. They continued the march to Ciudad Mier under the command of William S. Fisher. Battle of Mier On December 20, 1842, some 308 Texan soldiers, who had ignored orders to pull back from the Rio Grande to Gonzales, approached Ciudad Mier. They camped on the Texas side of the Rio Grande. 700 soldiers participated in the capture of the town, while the others remained behind as the camp guard. The Texans were unaware that 3,000 Mexican troops were in the area under the command of generals Francisco Mexia and Pedro de Ampudia. In the Battle of Mier that resulted, the Texians were outnumbered ten to one. They inflicted heavy casualties on the Mexicans--650 dead and 200 wounded--but they were forced to surrender on December 26 . The Mexicans took 243 Texans as prisoner and marched them toward Mexico City via Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n. On February 11, 1843, 181 Texans escaped but, by the end of the month, the lack of food and water in the mountainous Mexican desert resulted in 176 of them surrendering or being recaptured. This was in the vicinity of Salado, Tamaulipas. When the prisoners reached Saltillo, Coahuila, they learned that an outraged Santa Anna had ordered all the escapees to be executed, but General and Governor Francisco Mex√≠a of the state of Coahuila refused to follow the order.Nance, J. Milton. MIER EXPEDITION,\\" Handbook of Texas Online. accessed June 21, 2014. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. The new commander, Colonel Domingo Huerta, moved the prisoners to El Rancho Salado. By this time, diplomatic efforts on behalf of Texas by the foreign ministers of the United States and Great Britain led Santa Anna to compromise: he said one in ten of the prisoners would be killed.  Black Bean Episode  To help determine who would die, Huerta had 159 white beans and 17 black beans placed in a pot. In what came to be known as the Black Bean Episode or the Bean Lottery, the Texans were blindfolded and ordered to draw beans. Officers and enlisted men, in alphabetical order, were ordered to draw. The seventeen men who drew black beans were allowed to write letters home before being executed by firing squad. On the evening of March 25, 1843, the Texians were shot in two groups, one of nine men and one of eight. According to legend, Huerta placed the black beans in the jar last and had the officers pick first, so that they would make up the majority of those killed. Painted tile mural at Monument Hill State Historic Site, commemorating the execution of Texans after drawing black beans. The first Texan to draw a black bean was Major James Decatur Cocke. A witness recalled that Cocke held up the bean between his forefinger and thumb, and with a smile of contempt, said, \\"Boys, I told you so; I never failed in my life to draw a prize.\\" He later told a fellow Texan, \\"They only rob me of forty years.\\" Fearing that the Mexicans would strip his body after he was dead, he removed his pants and gave them to a companion whose clothing was in worse shape. He was shot with the sixteen others who drew black beans on March 25, 1843. His last words were reported to have been, \\"Tell my friends I die with grace.\\" The other sixteen who drew black beans in the lottery were William Mosby Eastland, Patrick Mahan, James M. Ogden, James N. Torrey, Martin Carroll Wing, John L. Cash, Robert Holmes Dunham, Edward E. Este, Robert Harris, Thomas L. Jones, Christopher Roberts, William N. Rowan, James L. Shepherd, J. N. M. Thomson, James Turnbull, and Henry Walling. Shepherd survived the firing squad by pretending to be dead. The guards left him for dead in the courtyard, and he escaped in the night but was recaptured and shot. Eastland County, Texas, is named after William Mosby Eastland.\\"Black bean episode\\", Handbook of Texas Online, published by the Texas State Historical Association; Retrieved May 02, 2011 Captain Ewen Cameron had drawn a white bean, but was ordered executed anyway by Santa Anna a month later while being held at Perote Prison. As he waited to die, Cameron refused to confess to a priest. Captain Samuel Walker \\"Bigfoot\\" Wallace 1872 The survivors who picked white beans, including Bigfoot Wallace and Samuel Walker, finished the march to Mexico City. They were later imprisoned at Perote Prison in the state of Veracruz, along with the 15 survivors of the Dawson Massacre and about 35 other men captured by General Adri√°n Woll in San Antonio. Some of the Texans escaped from Perote or died there. Most were prisoners until they were released, by order of Santa Anna, on September 16, 1844. Legacy The Mier Expedition- The Drawing of the Black Bean, Museum of Fine Arts, HoustonIn 1847, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the U.S. Army occupied northeastern Mexico. Captain John E. Dusenbury, a white bean survivor, returned to El Rancho Salado and exhumed the remains of his comrades. He traveled with the remains on a ship to Galveston, and by wagon to La Grange in Fayette County, Texas. La Grange citizens retrieved the remains of the men killed in the Dawson Massacre from their burial site near Salado Creek in Bexar County. The remains of both groups of men were reinterred in a ceremony attended by 1,000 people. They were buried in a large common tomb in 1848, in a cement vault on a bluff one mile south of La Grange. The grave site is now part of a state park, the Monument Hill and Kreische Brewery State Historic Sites.

The ballpark was home to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League from 1936 through 1957. The ballpark was located in downtown San Diego, at the end of West Broadway near the waterfront. Broadway bounded the park to the south (first base). Its other two close bounding streets were Harbor Drive (third base) and Pacific Highway (right field). There were various buildings to the north (left field) between the ballpark and Ash Street. History Before it was called Lane Field, the stadium began its life as a U.S. Navy athletic field in 1925. Two years later, football bleachers were added. The field also had a track, used for motorcycle and auto races. When Bill \\"Hardpan\\" Lane relocated his Hollywood Stars from the Los Angeles area in 1936, to become the San Diego Padres, he arranged for the Works Progress Administration to rebuild the venue as a baseball park. Although the WPA was known by the derisive nickname \\"We Putter Around\\", there was apparently no puttering in this project, as they finished the work in just two months time. It took the name Lane Field. The new construction had a temporary look to it. The park had no roof, no lights, and not even a backstop. Its bleachers sat 8,000. The original entrance, a small Spanish-architecture structure, was retained for the ballpark, behind where the home plate area was established. According to a 2004 San Diego Union-Tribune article, the original field dimensions were 339 feet to the left field foul pole, 480 to the deepest part of center field, and 355 feet to right, a large rectangle. Along with the other remodeling, the dimensions were eventually reduced to a more normal size: 329 to left, 426 to center, 330 to right. The first Padres game at Lane Field was played on March 31, 1936. The next year, a roof was added over the main part of the seating, and attendance improved. Attendance was boosted by a PCL pennant winning team and the attraction of budding young local star Ted Williams. On October 7, 1945, three African-American players from the California Winter League's \\"Kansas City Royals,\\" one of them named Jackie Robinson, worked out at an empty Lane Field. Look magazine photographer Maurice Terrell surreptitiously photographed the action from the stands by agreement with Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey, who was planning to desegregate Major League Baseball and wanted illustrations for a planned exclusive feature article written by Arthur Mann. The article and photos would have highlighted Robinson and other stars from the Negro Leagues, and was meant to accompany Rickey's announcement of signing them to the Dodgers. The article was never published in Look, but a selection of the Lane Field photographs was published in the November 27, 1945 issue of Look to illustrate the signing of Robinson to the Montreal Royals. The San Diego Padres would win another PCL pennant in 1954 at Lane Field. By then they had begun to look for a new facility. The wooden park, so near the waterfront in a presumably picturesque setting, was also constantly in need of repair and replacement of its boards, which tended to rot quickly in the sea air. Abandonment Lane Field was finally abandoned by the Padres following the 1957 PCL season. For 1958, the team shifted to the new Westgate Park, located in San Diego's Mission Valley area. The site of Lane Field became Cruise Ship Parking, a parking lot between Pacific Highway and Harbor Drive which was used by cruise ship passengers. It is located approximately halfway between the Star of India and USS Midway museum ships. In 2015 it was dedicated as a city park. A plaque, which was placed in 2003 at the corner of Broadway and Pacific Highway to commemorate the ballpark, was moved in 2015 to the corner of Broadway and Harbor Drive.

He is Professor Emeritus of Art History, and Curator Emeritus of Northwest Coast Indian Art at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture and occasionally lectures at the University of Washington in Seattle.Bill Holm, July 1987 His 1965 book Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form has for decades been the standard introductory text in the field; it is currently in its 18th printing. The 50th Anniversary Edition was published in 2014. This edition includes a new forward, artists' reflections, and other prefatory material. Most importantly, however, it has better photos and color art, which shows a critical dimension to this art. His students have included the Haida carver Freda Diesing and many others. His eight books have won scholarly acclaim and recognition with four Washington State Governor's Writers Awards, and two special Governor's awards. His achievements as an artist were celebrated in a 2000 book, Sun Dogs and Eagle Down, The Indian Paintings of Bill Holm. In 2001, he was honored with a certificate of appreciation from the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian people of Southeast Alaska through the Sealaska Heritage Institute. The Native American Art Studies Association recognized him with its Honor Award in 1991. The University of Washington honored him with a Distinguished Achievement Award from the College of Arts and Sciences in 1994 and selected him to give the annual University Faculty Lecture in 2003. He also received the Burke award for courage, excellence and bravery in 2010. The Bill Holm Center at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture was named for him, and the University of Washington annually gives out The Bill Holm Center Graduate Fellowship which funds students doing research and writing on Native art of the Pacific Northwest Coast. In 1942 he became involved with Henderson Camp later renamed Camp Nor'wester, a summer camp located in the San Juan Islands of Washington state. It was through this involvement he and his wife Marty struck up a friendship with Mungo Martin, which led to significant artistic accomplishments including the recording of hundreds of traditional Kwakwaka'wakw songs, the construction of \\"big houses\\" and totem poles on Lopez Island and John's Island, many traditional masks for dances, four Haida style canoes, and more. In 1953 he married his wife Marty, a highly skilled dancer well respected by the Kwakwaka'wakw people; they have two daughters, and each family member were given Kwakwaka'wakw names, a rare honor. British Columbia Provincial judge Alfred Scow, a Kwakwaka'wakw elder, said \\"[Bill Holm] has been a respectful student of our tradition, who took pains to learn Kwakwala. He is a very thorough art historian.\\" In 1962, a series of large paintings by Holm introduced Northwest Native motifs in the gallery of Northwest Coast art at the Century 21 Exposition (the 1962 Seattle World's Fair).Official Guide Book: Seattle World's Fair 1962, Acme: Seattle (1962), p. 96.

He acted as lead in recording from 1963 and 1978‚Äì79. His most recent work was in 2008, as both a mentor and musician with Generations, a group of jazz musicians headed by veteran drummer Jimmy Cobb. He contributed two new compositions for the album that was released by San Francisco State University's International Center for the Arts on September 15, 2008. Critics have compared him to pianists Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, and McCoy Tyner. Biography In his twenties, Mathews toured internationally and recorded with Roach, Freddie Hubbard and Roy Haynes. He was also a member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in the late 1950s through the 1960s. By thirty, he began teaching jazz piano and led workshops, clinics and master classes at Long Island University in New York City. Besides Dexter Gordon and Clark Terry, he toured and recorded on two Louis Hayes projects in the 70's (i.e. the Louis Hayes-Woody Shaw Quintet and the Louis Hayes-Junior Cook Quintet). One of the highlights of his career, and one of his longest associations, was with the Johnny Griffin Quartet. For almost five years (1978-1982) he was an integral part of this band and forged lasting relationships with Griffin, Kenny Washington (drums) and Ray Drummond (bass). The New York Times described Mathews as \\"a constant and provocative challenge to Mr. Griffin. [...He] is the energizer of the group\\". One of the few Johnny Griffin recordings that features Mathews' original compositions is \\"To the Ladies\\" (Galaxy). In the 1980s, Mathews began honing his role as a front man. He performed as a leader in duo, trio and quartet configurations around the world (from New York City to Genova, to the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands, and more). He also toured with Freddie Hubbard and Dizzy Gillespie's United Nations Band. Mathews was also involved in cross-media projects: he was pianist for the Tony Award winning Broadway musical, Black and Blue in 1989, and, in 1990, he was one of the artists who recorded for Spike Lee's movie, Mo' Better Blues. After a stint touring and recording with the Clifford Jordan Big Band in the early 1990s, Mathews joined T.S. Monk for eight years of touring and recording. The Chicago Tribune stated that \\"The soul of the band [...] is pianist Ronnie Mathews, whose angular romanticism provides the horn players with a lush and spicy foundation for their improvising\\".

Ltd born in Manchester, Great Britain. Established his business in 1869 and was making ¬£5,000 a year at the age of 30 with shops in all the major cities of Britain and warehouse in London.  Early life  Brooke was born as Arthur Brooke on 30, November,1845 in Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester to tea wholesaler Charles Brooke and Jane n√©e Howard. He had a short career in the textile industry before getting terminated due to the cotton famine in 1864, he trained to work in Peek Brothers and Winch tea company in Liverpool where he was transferred to the company's head office in London. But Brooke decided to return home to help in father to revive his wholesale tea business by establishing new outlets all over Lancashire.  Personal life  Brooke was married to Alice Young daughter of William Young a naval officer, in 1875. They first lived in Stonebridge Park, Willesden then moved to Bedford park, then Kensington later bought a country house near Dorking. The couple had four children Gerald, Justin, Neville, and Rupert and two known grandchildren namely John and David, who were all involved in the company. Brooke also had a younger sister named Agnes Bushell (n√©e Brooke), who went on to marry Alfred Thomas Bushell who previously worked in Brooke's Liverpool shop. Busheel emigrated to Australia and founded the Bushells Tea Company. Brooke died on 13 April 1918 in Dorking due to acute tuberculosis and pneumonia. A Blue Plaque was donated in his honour Brooke, Bond & Co in 1966 which can be seen at his birthplace in 6 George street, Ashton-under-Lyne.  Arthur Brooke in Brooke, Bond & Company Ltd.  In 1869 Brooke opened his first own shop and named the business Brooke Bond & Company at 29 Market Street, Manchester where he sold tea, coffee and sugar. He added the name Bond even though there was no Mr Bond because he liked the sound of it, hence the name stayed. Brooke developed and blended his products and sold them in ¬Ω lb and 1 lb paper bags. He offered precise mixtures of premium blends of tea and did not go with the marketing trends of the day, so customers could buy consistent flavours from week to week. Each bag was signed with the company name to avoid counterfeiting. Brooke delivered his products in his own transport to make sure they reached his customers regularly and always fresh, promising good quality products as the company's goal. One of Brooke's early slogan was ‚ÄúGood Tea unites good company, exhilarates the spirits, opens the heart, banishes restraint from conversation and promotes the happiest purposes of social intercourse‚Äù which indicted his adeptness for good advertising. In the early 1870s Brooke opened a warehouse in a London and shops in Liverpool, Leeds, London,Bradford and few stores in Scotland. The company headquarters in 1872 at 129 Whitechapel High Street in London. When the British trade industries were hit by long depression Brooke Bond had to close their stores in London and Scotland. Arthur Brooke had considered moving to New Zealand before he decided to sell his products to wholesale grocers that changed the direction of his business. This helped in further expanding the business but it Brooke Bond was now selling tea in packets to wholesale grocers instead of hand delivering 1/2 lb and 1 lb paper bags to customers. In 1892 the company became Brooke Bond & Company Ltd and the business was largely wholesale and Arthur Brooke became the chairperson and continued that role until he retired in 1910.The company expanded leading to purchases of warehouse on Whitehorse Street, Leeds and a sixty-eight-year signed lease of St. Dunstan's Hill, London which was the registered office of the company. The company was known to have become freeholders of warehouses in Goulston Street London in 1898. The business under Arthur Brooke was expanded to the Indian market as Brooke Bond Red label in 1903, where the brand is popular to this day. Brooke strictly followed the eight considered a model employers his employees looked upon him more as a colleague than an employer. His son Gerald Brooke took over the business as chairperson after Arthur Brooke retired in 1910.

The Grand Mosque had suffered a terrorist attack, but the U.S. was not involved. The U.S. diplomats survived by hiding in a reinforced area. Marine Security Guard Corporal Steven Crowley, 20, Army Warrant Officer Bryan Ellis, 30, and two Pakistani staff members were killed in the attack.  Events  On 20 November 1979, a Saudi Arabian Islamic zealot group led a takeover of the Mosque in Mecca. The group's demands included calling for the cutoff of oil exports to the United States and the expulsion of all foreign civilian and military experts from the Arabian Peninsula. However, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini allegedly claimed that Americans were behind the attack on Islam's holiest place. This claim was repeated in media reports the morning of 21 November. The event started as a small, peaceful protest against U.S. policies in Cambodia, as well as suspected U.S. involvement surrounding the military coup d'√©tat of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977. The protesters shouted anti- American slogans. At first glance the event seemed to be a small protest outside the embassy's walls. Later, buses filled with Jamaat-i-Islami supporters arrived at the main gate. Hundreds of people began climbing over the walls and trying to pull the walls down using ropes. According to an American investigation, the protesters, believing that an American Marine on the roof of the embassy had fired first, opened fire after a bullet fired at the gate's lock by one rioter ricocheted and struck other protesters. Who actually fired first has not been determined. Twenty-year-old Marine Steve Crowley was struck by a bullet and transported to the embassy's secure communication vault along with the rest of personnel serving in the embassy. Locked behind steel-reinforced doors the Americans waited for help to come and rescue them from the smoke-filled building. After nightfall a Marine unit was able to sneak out a back exit from the vault as the front door was too damaged to open. Finding the embassy empty they led the rest of the 140 people from the vault out into the courtyard. In media A detailed narrative of this event is provided in the book Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 by Steve Coll.

Located at 102 E. 7th Avenue, it was one of 10 Florida Carnegie libraries to receive grants awarded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 1901 to 1917. It was designed by Tampa architect Fred J. James and constructed from 1915-1917. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 16, 1991. Steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie provided funding for more than 3,000 Carnegie libraries in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The library was built using a $50,000 grant from Carnegie. The library's first director was Helen V. Stelle. It was Tampa's main library until 1968. It includes a T-plan, masonry, brown and yellow brick atop a rusticated granite basement, and is topped by a barrel tile roof. The building was rehabilitated in 1999 by the City of Tampa for public offices. It has been occupied by the administrative staff of the Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library System since November 2016 and also houses the Hillsborough Literacy Council, which is affiliated with the Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library system.https://hillsboroughliteracy.org/ Library Usage and Floorplan The library was widely used by patrons across Tampa who had fewer branches to choose from at the time of its use as an active branch; university students would enjoy the ample collection in order to do the research and study required of them. High school students,too, would come to do research at the branch, and some would enjoy going to the pool hall across the street from the library, which was notorious among patrons as well as librarians for having a diverse and interesting clientele that was not always a welcome presence at the library and would sometimes be a source of mischief. At the \\"7th Avenue Library,\\" as it was called by some patrons, children would enjoy storytelling, which would happen once or twice in the afternoon according to patron memories, and book selection in the children's library on west side of the basement level. Bernadette Storck, a worker of the library with the cataloging and processing department, details her memories of the library's floorplan and details of processes: The library had a circulation desk on the first floor, with reference on one side and popular materials on the other side. In the downstairs area, the west side housed the children's department, where storytime took place and children's material was kept. On the east side of that floor, cataloging and processing‚Äîinvolving, for example, hand lettering along spines in order to determine branches and subjects took place. The bookmobile collection was also kept there, as Tampa's first bookmobile was also kept in the Tampa Free Library. Upon patron request, backfiles of newspapers and magazines, kept behind smoked glass, would be sent upstairs. A dumbwaiter was used to put materials in and take them upstairs, as the building's current elevator had not been added at the time. Reasons for Closure Built in 1915, the Tampa Free Library originally stood as Tampa's main public library. However, over the decades, the library was no longer able to adequately meet the needs of the growing population. Concerns over the small size of the library, lack of expansion, and inability to assist the growing population eventually led to a new building being constructed in downtown Tampa. The original building was constructed and designed to serve 50,000 people which was adequate at the time of its construction. However, by the early 1960s, Tampa maintained a population of 274,407 people. In addition, other old, historical libraries in Tampa were also unable to meet the needs of the public due to poor parking, small size, and cramped collections.https://cdm16054.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15391coll2/id/5186/rec/1 This led to questions of whether newer, larger libraries should begin replacing the older, historical models. The Tampa Free library endeavored to cater to the population by expanding hours. In April 1960 the Tampa Public Library's expanded its hours, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, increasing the library's open hours from 66 to 72 hours per week. This was done with the hope that it would be more convenient for people working downtown to visit the library.https://cdm16054.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15391coll2/id/4947/rec/17 In 1961, the library was no longer seen as an adequate facility for the growing city of Tampa. As evidenced in an article by the Tampa Tribune in 1961, the library was discussed as being inadequate in space‚Äîdesignated to serve a community of 52,000 people, 274,407 people, with no additions to the building after its construction in 1915. A former worker of the library who'd been involved in cataloging and processing also recalled insufficient shelving space, stating that the huge collection with books, newspapers, and magazines were \\"falling off the shelves.\\". In fact, patrons had to travel quite far to the library; the library was used by patrons who lived in Hyde Park and Palma Ceia when it was an active branch, which made for a far distance to travel according to recollections. Therefore, eventually the need for space and change led to the creation of a new main library, currently titled the John F Germany Public Library on 900 N Ashley Drive. Opening on April 21, 1968, the John F. Germany Public Library still acts as the main library in the Tampa- Hillsborough County Library system.

Examples of stories that have played are: * Kidnapping of a local restaurant owner's son by thieves who wanted money in return.An article that was played sometime in May 2007 on the radio station * Use of Chinglish/Engrish on many Beijing road signs. The news reported that there were major efforts to clean this up before the Olympics.An article that was played also in May 2007 * Beijing traffic reports (frequent updates similar to WINS Radio in New York City). See also Beijing Jiaotong Tai. China news focus At a national level, this channel tends to focus on activity happening in China. Examples of such articles include: * Three Gorges Dam faces new challenges. * The recent college entrance exams that determines the future of many young people of whether they get to go to school or would they have to start working. * The Qinghai-Tibet Railroad was opened back in July 2006 and coverage of how much traffic was on that train. * The Mid Autumn Festival starts in October.

Numericable was originally created in 2007 from the merger between former competitors Noos and NC Numericable networks. Numericable Group SA was founded in August 2013 to act as the parent company of Numericable group companies and to offer its shares on the stock exchange. The company provides cable broadband services in France, Luxembourg and Portugal, offering digital and analog television, Internet, and phone services to homes. From 2008, Numericable also offered mobile telephone services to its customers. It was the leading cable television provider and internet access provider in metropolitan France. From 2012, Numericable held the largest high-speed broadband network in France, including a small portion using optical fiber or FTTX. On September 19, 2013, following failed talks with the French telecommunications company SFR, the company announced it had taken the first steps towards an initial public offering on the NYSE Euronext market in Paris. On March 5, 2014, Numericable, backed by its lead shareholder Altice, made an offer to buy Vivendi's SFR telecommunications affiliate, France's second largest. The bid is said to include about 11 billion euros ($15.2 billion) in cash, 3 billion euros in Numericable‚Äôs cable assets and a 750 million-euro capital increase by Altice. Numericable merged with SFR in November 2014 to form Numericable-SFR. In April 2016, the merged company adopted the SFR name across all its businesses. The brand Numericable remained used to designate the SFR cable and fiber TV offers (which had more channels than SFR ADSL) until 2019. History Origin of the network From the end of World War II until May 1981, when the French Socialist Party came swept to power with the election of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, the state held a monopoly on the production and distribution of audiovisual programmes on French territory. On July 29, 1982, Law 82-652 abolished the state monopoly and created both a Council and High Authority on Audiovisual Communication to oversee the liberalisation of the French audiovisual sector. In 1982, the National Cable Plan was approved, with the ambitious goal of connecting one million households within five years and using the most advanced techniques of the time, including fiber-optic technology. In order to finance the project, a public-private partnership was put in place that allowed private operators to utilise the networks set up by France Telecom to commercial ends. Regulations provided for highly favourable concessions that were awarded to private operators (up to 99 years). Water and Sewage Treatment service providers often diversified into the cable market and used their close ties with local municipalities to win concessions.\\"La t√©l√©vision par c√¢ble\\" by Jos√© Fr√®ches, collection \\"Que sais-je ?\\", Presses universitaires de France, pages 34 to 39 On June 6, 1985, the group Lyonnaise des eaux created the company Paris C√¢ble, which would later become Lyonnaise C√¢ble, Noos, and Numericable. Officially launched on November 25, 1986, the launch of the National Cable Plan marked the start of the commercial use of cable networks in Paris. In 1996, 16 regional operators merged into a national player, Lyonnaise Communications. From Lyonnaise C√¢ble to Noos In May 2000, Noos became the brand name of Lyonnaise Communications in a move that was accompanied by the harmonization of Lyonnaise‚Äôs cable networks. Following its national expansion strategy, Noos took over the cable television assets of French group NTL in November 2001. At this point, three cable operators were still in business: France Telecom, NC Numericable and Noos. New fiber optic network and diversification NC Numericable and Noos merged in 2006. One year later, the brand Noos disappeared and was replaced by the name Numericable. A new logo and marketing campaign was subsequently launched in August 2007. For the first time, all of French cable networks were technically owned by one company. In 2005, Num√©ric√¢ble launched its activities in the Antilles. In 2008, Le C√¢ble Numericable bought WSG and MTVC, the major cable operators in Guadeloupe and Martinique. Mobile virtual network operator In 2007, Numericable announced that it had signed a deal with Bouygues Telecom to use its mobile network, thereby opening the way to offering mobile services to its customers. The company subsequently launched the service in 2008. Numericable was launched as a mobile virtual network operator on May 16, 2011, advertising an ‚Äòunlimited‚Äô offer and highlighting its competitiveness. To accompany its business development, Numericable launched a ‚Äòtriple play‚Äô internet offer, costing four euros per month, on September 13, 2011. In order to compete with new offers launched by rival company Free, Numericable launched an ‚Äòunlimited‚Äô mobile phone plan costing ‚Ç¨19.99 per month on January 23, 2012, contributing to the company‚Äôs general move to lower prices. Launching fiber optic technology in France To compete with competitors‚Äô Internet terminals, Numericable announced the launch of ‚ÄòBox by Numericable‚Äô, a product that is both modem and receiver. According to the operator, the box allows access to 300 thematic channels, to the Internet and to make an unlimited number of calls to landlines and mobile numbers in France, as well as to several international locations. For the eligible clients, the Box allows a high-speed internet connection (up to 200 megabytes/second) as long as it is linked to a local network. The Box also gives its clients access to videos on-demand (VOD) and multiple social network applications, such as Twitter. SFR Public Offering While the name of the group was Numericable, the management remained legally administered by two separate companies: Numericable SAS and NC Numericable (formerly known as Noos). Ypso Holding S.√† r.l. was a holding company controlling Numericable companies, owned by the American Carlyle Group (35%), the British private equity firm Cinven (35%) and Altice, a Luxembourg- based cable operator (30%). On 2 August 2013, Numericable Group SA was formed as the parent company of Numericable group companies. On September 19, 2013, Numericable Group announced the launch of a legal and financial process aimed at the company‚Äôs initial public offering on the Paris stock exchange, regulated by NYSE Euronext. The declared objective was to obtain new financial resources to invest in French fiber-optic development. The shares were offered on 7 November 2013. Recent news In November 2014, France‚Äôs competition watchdog approved a deal for Numericable to acquire Virgin Mobile France for ‚Ç¨325 million. SFR launched its fiber packages in November 2014, using the Numericable network and TV bouquets. In France, the cable networks had an exemption from exclusivity of TV channels. Following the launch of the SFR by Numericable offers, Canalsat has withdrawn the Numericable exemption, which has made it lose certain channels such as Eurosport, Disney XD, Disney Junior, Disney Cinema, Com√©die+, Plan√®te+, T√©l√©toon+ and Piwi+. Altice launched its SVOD service, Zive, on 17 November 2015. It was renamed SFR Play in late 2016. Altice acquired the rights of many sports competitions (Premier League, Liga NOS, Champions League) to form its SFR Sport bouquet. Altice signed an exclusive agreement with Discovery and NBCUniversal in December 2016. The premium movies and series TV channel Altice Studio was launched on 22 August 2017. Numericable was rebranded as SFR in Belgium and Luxembourg on 15 February 2016, with its launch of Zive. In December 2016, Altice announced to sell SFR Belux to Telenet for ‚Ç¨400 million. The Numericable and SFR channels numbering were merged on 22 August 2017, and in 2019, the Numericable exclusive channels (MTV, Nickelodeon, S√©rie Club, Cartoon Network...) were added to SFR ADSL offer. The brand Numericable disappeared. Services The company provided the following services: *Internet or TV access; *Internet and telephone access; *Internet, telephone and TV access; *All the above services including a mobile phone contract. National Network Numericable controls the vast majority of the cable network in France, representing some 9.5 million potential households or about 32% of French households. The company has 3.5 million television subscribers, 1,037,000 for internet and 753,000 for telephone services. As of June 2012, the cable operator counts over a half million high-speed fiber-optic customers and 4.6 million households connected to the network. Later that year in November 2012, a company press release announced that the number had grown to almost 600,000. According to figures published by Arcep, Numericable holds 70% of the high-speed fiber-optic market. International Network Numericable also had operations in Luxembourg, Belgium, French Caribbean (Martinique, Guadeloupe and French Guyana) and Portugal. In 2016, Numericable was replaced by SFR in Belgium, Luxembourg and Overseas France. In Portugal, Altice sold Cabovis√£o, due to Meo acquisition, to Apax France and it was rebranded as Nowo in January 2017.

It is located in the Vedaranyam taluk of the Nagapattinam district. It sits on the mouth of the Addapar River. Based on the 2001 census in India and numerous village and tsunami censuses after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, it has a population of approximately 4500 people, most of whom lower middle class and intermediate caste. The village's primary businesses, like other villages on the coast of Tamil Nadu, are farming and fishing. The entire Nagapattinam district was severely affected by the Indian Ocean tsunamis, however, Naluvedapathy emerged virtually unscathed. This was due to the presence of a very large windbreak planted by inhabitants of the region in 2002. History On 4 December 2002, 300 farmers planted 80,244 Casuarina saplings in 24 hours, achieving a new Guinness World Record in the process forming what has been called \\"The Guinness Garden\\". This Guinness Record plantation was organised by Nagapattinam District Administration led by District Collector Sudeep Jain and Sub Collector S J Chiru.The world Record in a tsunami village Dilip D'Souza, 10 October 2005 According to Sudeep Jain, \\"We planted trees for invoking rain gods as this area had faced drought for several years\\". The saplings were spread over 20 hectares next to the coast.Bitsunami Village beats tsunami with tree power Financial Express, 30 January 2005 On 26 December 2004, tsunamis battered the coast of Tamil Nadu after an earthquake in Sumatra: the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. However, out of 8,000 fatalities in the state, only one was from Naluvedapathy and most of the village remained unscathed. The trees, which were known to be strong wind barriers, served as barriers against the tsunamis and stopped a large amount of water from reaching the village. It was also noted that there was no loss of life within the fishing community and no psychological trauma amongst the people of the village following the tsunami. Sudeep Jain later mobilised his school alumni and founded a tsunami rehabilitation trust named BITSunami to rehabilitate and develop this village along with neighbouring Pushpavanam village. BITSunami and District Administration led by then District Collector J Radhakrishnan once again went on a massive tree plantation spree planting 254,464 saplings on 2 Oct 2005 creating a new Guinness World Record. Demographics Based on the 2001 census, the total population of Naluvedapathy is 4354 with 2199 males and 2155 females. Out of 1515 households, only three were attributed to forward castes. Most inhabitants of the village inhabitants speak Tamil and the majority of inhabitants in the Nagapattinam district are Hindu in religion. Economy The village's primary businesses are in fishing and the farming of tamarind, groundnut, mango, coconut and cashew. The region also has an immense number of Casuarina trees. The farming industry has suffered in past years due to a long drought. Thirty-six percent of households in the region are involved in the fishing industry. The primary area of fishing is in the Bay of Bengal. The village possesses school buildings and sanitation facilities and is well-connected to roads and electricity. Education is provided for students in the village up to middle school, however students have to travel numerous kilometres for secondary education. Transportation As in most Indian villages, the only method of transportation within the village is walking and two wheelers. An extensive bus system exists for travelling outside the village. The village is connected to other parts of Tamil Nadu via road. Its connection to other parts of Tamil Nadu is mainly used for the educational purposes of students, who need to travel 7‚Äì10 km to go to a location which has secondary education.

Walker was elected governor of Florida after the Civil War ended. The country was recovering from the aftermath of the Civil War and so it was a tough time in office. Despite the turmoil, Walker's efforts to establish public education in Florida were a great achievement. While Walker was in office, in 1884, he offered two rooms for a library in a building he owned. Donations were raised by the community to buy books and create a reading room that was open to the public.https://tallahasseehistoricalsociety.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/08/THS-Vol-2-2.pdf After Walker's death, the building was sold and Walker's wife donated the lot to the library association and the building was named in honor of Walker and his support for education and libraries.

It consists of Reason in Common Sense, Reason in Society, Reason in Religion, Reason in Art, and Reason in Science. The work is considered to be the most complete expression of Santayana's moral philosophy; by contrast, his later magnum opus, the four-volume The Realms of Being, more fully develops his metaphysical and epistemological theory, particularly his doctrine of essences. Santayana's philosophy is strongly influenced by the materialism of Democritus and the refined ethics of Aristotle, with a special emphasis on the natural development of ideal ends. The Life of Reason is sometimes considered to be one of the most poetic and well-written works of philosophy in Western history. To supply but a single example, the oft-quoted aphorism of Santayana's, \\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\\" may be found on p. 284 of Reason in Common Sense. In 1951, near the end of his life, Santayana engaged himself in the weighty task of producing a one-volume abridgment of The Life of Reason at the urging of his editor at Scribner's, with the assistance of his friend and student, Daniel Cory. As Cory writes in the volume's preface, in addition to excising prolixities and redundancies from the book, \\"[a] sustained effort was made to dispel those early mists of idealism from the realistic body of his philosophy, and to make clear to the reader that our idea of a natural world can never be that world itself.\\" Volumes Entries are needed for the other two volumes: Reason in Common Sense - the 1st volume! - and also Reason in Art Reason in Society Santayana wishes, according to Will Durant, to \\"devise a means whereby men may be persuaded to virtue without the stimulus of supernatural hopes and fears.\\" Unfortunately, as he says in 'Reason in Society', \\"a truly rational morality or social regimen has never existed in the world, and is hardly to be looked for\\" as such constructions are the luxury of philosophers. The non-philosopher must rely upon the \\"growth of those social emotions which bloom in the generous atmosphere of love and the home.\\" He agrees with Arthur Schopenhauer that, in love, \\"nine-tenths of the cause of love are in the lover, for one- tenth that may be in the object\\" and that love \\"fuses the soul again into the impersonal blind flux.\\" Despite this, he still champions love as the most fulfilling experience of life: \\"Laplace is reported to have said on his deathbed that science was mere trifling, and that nothing was real but love.\\" Families and children are immensely important too, as, \\"we commit the blotted manuscript of our lives more willingly to the flames, when we find the immortal text half engrossed in a fairer copy.\\" Though families provide the basic unit of organization among men, it is necessary to develop beyond them. For this, he advocates a sort of natural aristocracy, for though the state is \\"a monster,\\" he accepts its necessity in maintaining stability and safety for its constituents. This 'natural aristocracy' (a term never used by Santayana; taken instead from Thomas Jefferson) is built upon Santayana's dislike of equality‚Äîhe argues, with Plato, that \\"the equality of unequals is inequality\\"‚Äîthough he still champions equality of opportunity. Moreover, Santayana distrusts democracy, and sees it as \\"a vulgar, anonymous tyranny,\\" much like Plato. His society would be, roughly, a meritocracy in which the most competent and capable would govern, with all men and women possessing an open road to government: \\"The only equality subsisting would be equality of opportunity.\\" In a phrase anticipating John Rawls, Santayana says: \\"but for the excellence of the typical single life no nation deserves to be remembered more than the sands of the sea;\\" indeed, in A Theory of Justice Rawls notes that \\" the natural aristocracy [of Santayana] is a possible interpretation of the two principles of justice,\\" though he ultimately rejects such a conception in favour of democratic equality. Santayana advocates such a mix of aristocracy and democracy, and believes that under such a system art and science would flourish, and corruption be minimized. Corruption abounds in common governments, which often become a vehicle for war, the worst of all crimes of the state. Over-Patriotism too is abject to him, and he sees it responsible for many of the crimes of the state. Though he proposes no philosophy of international relations, he muses that the development of international sports could provide something of \\"a moral equivalent for war\\" and that finance and trade between nations may help foster more peace between them. At last, he laments the rise of industrialism; quoting Emerson: \\"things are in the saddle and ride mankind.\\" Leisure is critically important to a society, and necessary for the development of culture and arts, since \\"civilization has hitherto consisted in the diffusion and dilution of habits arising in privileged centers.\\" The American Dream and the dream of \\"laissez- faire industrialism\\" is a lie, and is responsible for the endless struggles of modern man. Reason in Religion Though a philosophical atheist, Santayana is often described as an aesthetic Catholic. Influenced by his Spanish Roman Catholic heritage, he laments his own loss of faith, calling religious (especially Catholic) belief a \\"splendid error, which conforms better to the impulses of the soul\\"George Santayana, \\"Later Soliloquies\\" (1922), p. 253: \\"Was it, I wonder, this touch of sympathy with splendid error, bred in me by long familiarity with religion and philosophy, that offended my honest critics? Now that I show less sympathy with it, will they be better satisfied? I fear the opposite is the case. What they resented was rather that in spite of all my sympathy, and of all my despair about science, it never occurred to me to think those errors true, because they were splendid, except true to the soul. Did they expect that I should seriously debate whether the Ghost in Hamlet really came out of Purgatorial fires, and whether Athena really descended in her chariot from Olympus and pulled Achilles by his yellow hair when he was in danger of doing something rash?\\" than life. Durant says he: \\"achieves his masterpiece in 'Reason in Religion', filling his skeptical pages with a tender sadness, and finding in the beauty of Catholicism plentiful cause for loving it still.\\" Santayana scorns the harsh treatment of religion by many \\"worm-eaten old satirists,\\" and emphasizes the importance of understanding religion for understanding man, since religion is common to all men. With the touch of a poet, he lauds the beauty of religious myths while condemning literal treatment of religion to the flames. He especially derides the \\"northern barbarians\\"Will Durant (1961), p. 499 who are responsible for Protestantism, and believes they are mostly responsible for its literal interpretation and the loss of Christianity's poetry. Reason in Science Santayana holds that reason bases itself on science, as \\"science contains all trustworthy knowledge.\\" Though he acknowledges the limitations of science and reason in finding metaphysical truths, he holds the scientific method as \\"merely a shorthand description of regularities observed in our experience\\" and says in 'Reason in Common Sense': \\"faith in the intellect...is the only faith yet sanctioned by its fruits.\\" Proposing no technically new metaphysic, Santayana instead applies old philosophies to the modern day. He admires the atomism of Democritus and emphasis upon technically reason of Aristotle. Santayana is a materialist and a naturalist, and strongly dislikes the more mystical metaphysics of many of his contemporaries; he rejects even the pantheism of Spinoza, saying that \\"the word nature is poetical enough; it suggest sufficiently the generative and controlling function, the endless vitality and changeful order of the world in which I live.\\" Materialism and mechanism are the governing forces of the universe; there is nothing outside their laws, and nothing exempt‚Äîhumans included. Staying true to this materialism, Santayana rejects the existence of a transcendent soul, instead positing that \\"the soul is only a fine quick organization within the material animal.\\" He also rejects immortality in the common sense of the word, saying in Skepticism and Animal Faith: \\"I believe there is nothing immortal...No doubt the spirit and energy of the world is what is acting in us, as the sea is what rises in every little wave; but it passes through us; and, cry out as we may, it will move on. Our privilege is to have perceived it as it moved.\\" He does, however, espouse an unorthodox, Spinozist view of immortality: Bibliography * Reason in Common Sense, 1905 * Reason in Society, 1905 * Reason in Religion, 1905 * Reason in Art, 1905 * Reason in Science, 1906 Notes References  Rawls, John.

Plot Jinx Roberts (Dick Foran), an arrogant but talented stunt pilot, and his assistants Blackie (Bud Abbott) and Heathcliff (Lou Costello), are fired from a carnival air show after a disagreement with the owner. Jinx decides to join the Army Air Corps, and he, Blackie and Heathcliff go to a nightclub to party one last time. Jinx falls for the club's singer, Linda Joyce (Carol Bruce). Coincidentally, she leaves her job to become a USO hostess at the same Academy where Jinx and her brother, Jimmy (Charles Lang), are enrolled. Jinx's instructor at the Academy turns out to be Craig Morrison (William Gargan), his co-pilot on a commercial aircraft years earlier, and the two still hold animosity for each other. Meanwhile, Blackie and Heathcliff persuade a colonel to allow them to join the Air Corps as ground crewman. They fall in love with twin USO hostesses (Martha Raye in a dual role). Jinx hatches a plan to help Jimmy solo by abandoning him in mid-air. Jimmy is nearly killed landing the plane. Linda deplores Jinx for his ill-conceived actions and he, along with Blackie and Heathcliff, who have had several mishaps of their own, are discharged from the air corps. In an aerial display during graduation, Craig parachutes out of a plane but gets his chute caught on the tail end of the aircraft. Jinx, watching from the ground, confiscates an aircraft and flies to his rescue. For his heroic actions, Jinx is reinstated and wins back Linda's affections.

Reception Reviews from critics were generally not as positive as those for previous Abbott and Costello films. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times found (the), \\"routine and sticky\\" plot overly intrusive on the duo's antics and concluded that \\"As sustained entertainment ...

It indicates that the boys are appearing too often with their burlycue type of roustabout comedy to remain in public popularity for any length of time, unless new material is provided for their screen appearances.

It began by the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko declaring the Drazdy Complex as property of the government and shutting it down for repairs. The problem was that many diplomats, especially from Western nation-states, called the complex home. Though Lukashenko tried to negotiate a situation with the Western powers, such as France and Germany by appointing Uladzimir Herasimovich for talks, it was not solved in time. In protest of the incident, the United States temporarily recalled its ambassador, Daniel V. Speckhard, who spent one year back in Washington before returning to Belarus. One of the results of the incident was that the European Union issued Lukashenko and approximately 130 other government officials with travel bans that prevent them from traveling to fourteen of the then-fifteen EU states. This also began to lead the United States and non-EU states to issue similar bans (the United States has an exemption for visits to the United Nations headquarters in New York City, New York by the banned officials). According to ITAR-TASS and BelPAN, the Drazdy Complex is now used as a residence for the president and the evicted diplomats were given new locations in Minsk.

Born of prosperous parents who taught him to appreciate art and the countryside, he first trained as an architect but quickly realised his vocation was painting. He studied art in Geneva and Paris then settled in Versailles. In the course of his life he travelled widely and lived at various times in Florence, Montpellier, Seppey (Moudon) and Neuch√¢tel. His later years were spent in Paris where he died a celebrated and well respected artist both in Switzerland and France. He was primarily a realist painter of nature. Most of his works were of rural scenes, often with animals, the depiction of which he was a master. He increasingly painted human figures and by the end of his career could be called a portraitist whose skill revealing character was profound. A deeply religious man, his Protestant beliefs led him to include more religious works that he put his stamp of realism on, and he became best known in Europe for his illustrations of \\"The Parables\\", that was published in French, German and English versions over four decades. His works are now widely distributed in museums and private collections throughout the world and in his own dedicated museum in Moudon. His final project was a series of 104 pastel portraits of allied WW1 participants of all nationalities that was incomplete when he died; a unique body of work that was subsequently published as a book in 1922 and recently republished in 2010. Eugene Burnand was a good living family man who kept detailed records of his life and work that facilitate a thorough understanding of his methods and motives. He, his wife Julia and family of eight children, including two sets of twins, moved with him as his work took him around France and Switzerland. His traditional style ensured a conventional appreciation that he and his family enjoyed, but brought some criticism and conflict with contemporaries who were embracing modern art. Burnand was greatly influenced by artists such as Jean-Fran√ßois Millet and Gustave Courbet. This is reflected in perhaps his best known work, The Disciples Peter and John Running to the Sepulchre on the Morning of the Resurrection 1898, which hangs in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. Biography ;Early lifeRen√© Burnand: \\" Eug√®ne Burnand l'homme l'artiste et son ≈ìuvre \\" Berger-Levrault Paris 1926 He was born on 30 August 1850 in Chateau Billens, the property of his grandfather Charles Burnand, in Moudon, Vaud, Switzerland, a French speaking region north of Lausanne. His parents, (Colonel) ƒñdouard Burnand and Henriette (n√©e Foltz) were part of the Protestant bourgeois establishment of the town. His father was a forestry inspector who travelled considerably, invented the Pr√©laz- Burnand rifle in 1859 and had \\"the gifts and temperament of an artist, and drew and painted all his life as an amateur\\". Eug√®ne was the youngest of three surviving children. His older brothers had already left home when he was born and were working in France. The family soon moved to Chateau Carouge in the Moudon Ville Haute. Both his parents were well educated and cultured and he had a mature relationship with them. He travelled often with his father throughout the Canton of Vaud in the course of his work and this instilled in him a love of, and familiarity with the region. Up to the age of ten his formal education was in Moudon. The family moved to Florence in late 1860 where his father was charged with introducing the Pr√©laz-Burnand rifle to the Tuscan army. Seven months later they returned to Switzerland and set up residence in Schaffhouse, but meantime Eug√®ne had done well at school in Florence and its artistic heritage had made a lasting impression on him. His secondary education continued in Schaffhouse in German and in 1867 he somewhat reluctantly took his father's advice to study architecture at Zurich so he might have a reliable means of earning a living. His artistic talents shone however, and he changed over to study painting, and after four years in Zurich he gained his architecture diploma and went to Geneva to study for a short time under the celebrated Barth√©lemy Menn whose style he greatly admired. ;Artistic career 1872 to 1895 In 1872 he entered the Fine Arts School in Paris under Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and he later became a pupil. He spent time with his brother Ernest in Provence in 1873 and loved this region in which he painted many scenes over the years. One of his first works from that time 'Donkeys in the Midi' is shown here. In 1877 he spent time in Florence and Rome but returned to France the following year when he married and settled in Versailles, acquiring new skills from the workshop of his wife's family, who were the well known painters and engravers Girardet. He produced many successful paintings of animals in Provence, particularly in the Camargue region. 'Troupeau de boeufs au bord de la mer\\" was another typical study at this time. In 1879 he produced one of his impressive large works, 'La Pompe √† Feu' measuring 200 x 310 cm, an action picture with men and horses. The beautiful and sunny 'Gleaners' followed in 1880. He became publicly noticed in 1884 with the publication of 'Mireille', an epic poem by Fr√©d√©ric Mistral illustrated by Burnand. The same year he produced 'Bull in the Alps', another large striking picture which further demonstrated his skill painting animals. He moved to Paris in 1885 and stayed four years, during which time he, with other Swiss artists organised the Swiss fine arts section for the Paris International Exhibition of 1889, a task that caused some difficult relationships with other artists later on. Moving from Paris to Montpellier he completed 'La Descente des troupaux' 200 x 120 cm OOC in 1890. He moved back to Switzerland to be near his sick father in 1892 and completed several canvases of Swiss scenes including Lake Geneva. Following the death of his father and soon after his mother in 1894 he remained in the family home at Seppey near Moudon and produced 'The Peasant farmer' and his only major historical painting 'La Fuite de Charles le T√©m√©raire (apr√®s la bataille de Morat)', 'The flight of Charles the Bold after the battle of Morat'. By this time he had produced over one hundred catalogued works.Eug√®ne Burnand : \\"Liber Veritatis\\" Journal of the artist.

At the start of the 20th century he was at the height of his fame and he and other artists contributed to the ceiling of the now famous \\"Train Bleu\\" buffet in the Gare de Lyon, Paris, that at the time was major part of the new building work to mark the Paris International Exhibition of 1900. Burnand painted \\"Le Mont-Blanc vu de Clerg√®re\\".Oil painting on ceiling of the 'Train Bleu\\", Gare de Lyon buffet, Paris, by Eug√®ne Burnand \\"Le Mont-Blanc vu de Clerg√®re\\" 1900 Another large major picture with a religious theme was started in this period, \\"La Pri√®re sacerdotale\\", done during a temporary move to Florence for the winter of 1900-1. He changed the head of Christ several times and the final version was done in 1918. As with most of his paintings of this type, he used models from his large circle of friends and neighbours, many of whom were local tradesmen. The individuals in this painting are carefully described in Ren√© Burnand's biography of his father. The image shown here is the final version. Before he moved back to Switzerland in 1903 so his family could re-establish their Swiss roots, many other religious works were completed such as \\"J√©sus √† B√©thanie (Jesus at Bethany)\\", \\"L'Invitation au festin (Invitation to the Feast)\\" and \\"L'Homme de douleur (Man of sorrow)\\". The location in which he chose to live back in his native Switzerland was the village of Hauterive, close to Neuchat√™l, in a large old house with a terrace with old trees, a setting that provided all the backdrops he needed for his \\"Les Paraboles\\"Les Paraboles. Eug√®ne Burnand, Berger-Levrault, Paris 1908 project, that took him most of the four years he spent there. It became a book of thirty-two parables illustrated by 76 paintings, drawings and sketches. It was first published in 1908 in French, later in German, and an English edition in 1948. This book and the pictures from it made him well known, and were very widely used by religious organisations in Europe and throughout the world and can still be found today. The pictures are characterised by uniquely individual people showing the emotion and gravitas of the stories, which he achieved by once again using models from the people in his locality and often his wife Julia for the females required. He believed that religious messages in art should depict everyday people showing their humanity. A web facsimile of his \\"Parables\\" in English is available. He also completed the large canvas, \\"La Voie Douloureuse (Via Dolorosa)\\" while at Hauterive. He moved back to Paris with his family in 1907 and it remained his main base until his death. The war years 1914-18 were spent back at Seppey, and there were many trips in the furtherance of painting projects to locations such as Monpellier, Marseille and Assisi where worked on the pictures for the book \\"The Little Flowers of Saint Francis\\".The Little Flowers of Saint Francis, Translation by Thomas Okey with 30 drawings by Eug√®ne Burnand.

His series \\"Types vaudois\\" at this time, portraits of regional characters of Vaud, probably set the style for his later military types. His last large canvas \\"Labour dans le Jorat\\" was done at Seppey in 1915 but was destroyed in a fire at Lausanne in early 1916. He had repainted the canvas within a year.

In 1917, with the experience of his limited series of \\"Types Vaudois\\" behind him, he set out to make a series of pencil and pastel portraits of \\"types\\" that were engaged with the military in the war that had started in 1914. Burnand was fascinated by the wide range of people from varied races from all over the world who had been drawn into the conflict on the side of the Allies. He was more interested in the lowly than the leaders and travelled about France to find his subjects in ports and barracks. He got to know them first, often to meet his family and give hospitality. That way he got to know their true feelings and attitudes, which he depicted with great skill. He had completed 40 by 1918 at the end of the war, but the military remained active for a long time afterwards, and he completed 104 in all. Eighty were exhibited at the Luxembourg Museum, Paris, in 1919 to great public acclaim, and 100 were exhibited a year later as a prelude to their publication as a book in 1922.\\"Les Allies dans la Guerre des Nations\\" De Luxe edition, Cr√©t√© Paris, 1922 Most (101) of the originals were purchased by American philanthropist William Nelson Cromwell for the French Nation and they are now held by the French Legion of Honour where 72 of the 101 are displayed at their museum in Paris.

His work has been considered too 'photographic' by critics to gain the same merit by academics and consequently he has not remained well known even in Switzerland and France. He was never very well known in the English speaking world but has recently been reviewed well, and is being re-evaluated as an artist who was able to represent the soul of his country through cool, honest, and deeply insightful draughtsmanship.http://www.19thc- artworldwide.org/index.php/autumn04/290-eugene-burnand-18501921-peintre- naturaliste-by-philippe-kaenel His picture of the \\"Disciples running to the Sepulchre\\" is finding a new appreciative audiencehttp://www.crisismagazine.com/2014/the-greatest-easter-painting-ever- made#.U1E5JDaxciQ.wordpress and the centenary of the First World War has generated interest in its art, to which Burnand made a large contribution and is getting new attention.http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/eugene- burnands-world-war-i-portraits.htmlhttp://www.insted.co.uk/teachers-needed.pdf People interested in Burnand may find a new publication of help as it is the first book about him in English focusing on the war portraits but also covering other works.Eugene Burnand.

It is located 212 Northwest 1st Avenue. On August 5, 1996, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It was named after Lily Lawrence Bow, Homestead's first librarian. The Lily Lawrence Bow Library Lily Lawrence Bow Lily Lawrence Bow was born in 1870. She was a college educated woman who loved the outdoors and was married to Richard Bow who, it seems, was an alcoholic. Originally from Chicago but having learned that it was possible to make a living growing limes and cotton in the Florida Keys, Bow convinced her husband to move to Cudjoe Key in 1904 with their two sons (14 and 4) and start a new life together. There they purchased 207 acres of hardwood hammock, salt ponds, and lime trees. At that time Cudjoe Key was very desolate and remote. The nearest town was Key West, a 20-mile sailboat ride away. The residents numbered just a few families who scratched out a living by making charcoal. The railroad hadn't been built yet.Scott, Dianne. \\"How Bow Channel Got Its Name\\". http://islandjanemagazine.com/in-the-spotlight/how-bow-channel- got-its-name/ Richard Bow did not last long in this new farmer's life. Just a few short months after arriving in Cudjoe Richard left his family behind. Before leaving he transferred the property title to Lily. To survive Bow planted melons, pineapples, yams, tomatoes, and limes while her sons fished and hunted deer. Since she was college educated Bow taught her sons as well as the children from a neighboring family from Sugarloaf Key. The family would pay her with meat and vegetables. Surprisingly Bow had an upright piano in her one-room cabin.Born, George Walter. \\"Historic Florida Keys: An Illustrated History of Key West & the Keys\\". Historical Publishing Network, 2003, p. 44. The Florida Eastcoast Railway began conducting survey work in 1906. One of the engineers, William Krome, befriended Bow and strongly urged her to leave the area. Many railroad workers would be arriving soon and he was worried for her safety and that of her sons. Initially Bow did not want to leave but relented after Krome gave her sixteen-year-old son a job with the railroad. She and her family left Cudjoe in October 1906, only days before a hurricane swept through, killing over one hundred railroad workers.ibid In Miami she worked as a music teacher but Bow preferred the type of life she had on Cudjoe so she applied for a homestead grant in Homestead, Florida. There she built a cabin on the corner of 2nd Avenue and Avocado Drive.Fleming, Katherine. \\"Lily Lawrence Bow\\". http://womenoflibraryhistory.tumblr.com/post/81288896489/lily- lawrence-bow, 2014.Scott, Dianne. \\"How Bow Channel Got Its Name\\". http://islandjanemagazine.com/in-the-spotlight/how-bow-channel-got-its-name/ Bow sold citrus and raised chickens.

The Library In 1920 the Women's Club of Homestead appointed Bow chair of their library committee, which soon became a public library. She was the first librarian in Homestead. Since the city had no position for a librarian, Bow was appointed as a policeman instead. Book donations came from Dade County and she gave books to the local schools.

Career At club level, Liebrich played solely for Kaiserslautern, and breaking into the first team in the 1940s. He was in the 1950s part of the team that won the German championship in the 1951 and 1953 seasons. He appeared sixteen times for the West German national football team, and was a member of the West Germany team that won the 1954 FIFA World Cup, in which he played in the final.

History Nocturnal Wonderland is a two-day event (previously a three-day festival from 2011 to 2016) that used to occur in early September around Labor Day.The 17th Annual Nocturnal Wonderland - Saturday September 24th, 2011 There are usually 5 stages with a total of over 60 different artists performing throughout the two nights. The music genres vary around the genres trance, drum and bass, breakbeat, and house genres. The first Nocturnal Wonderland was held in 1995, varying the locations (Los Angeles, Empire Polo Club, etc.) every year. Since 2002 the Nocturnal Wonderland takes place at the National Orange Show Events Center in San Bernardino after having first taken place at that location in 1998. This venue has predominantly been the location of the festival since 2003 along with the Glen Helen Amphitheater. In June 2019, it was announced that this would be the last year that the show would take place at Glen Helen due to new noise ordinances in the area. On Labor Day Weekend 2010, the Nocturnal Festival Texas in Rockdale, Texas was introduced. In 2016, hundreds of people were arrested at the event. Stages There are typically around five main stages at the event, themed with unique decoration and lighting. \\"The Labyrinth\\": This stage has usually been held in a giant warehouse-like building. In 2010, the stage was meant for a wider and taller tent but was switched with Alice's House to accompany more attendees. The decorations for this stage included tall stacks of speakers, huge colorful designs, abstract shapes hanging from the ceiling, lasers, smoke machines, and a display of lights. In recent years, trapeze artists have performed above the crowd during the shows. This stage typically plays host to the trance genres. Alice's House: This stage was once held on a huge grass field next to a man-made lagoon. An outdoor stage, it originally featured chill/groovy house vibes. In 2010 the stage became much bigger and was accompanied by more upbeat and energetic house music. The Upside Downroom: This stage used to play host to various techno and house genres, but it has grown to become a mixed-genre tent. The Sunken Garden: This stage is the most energy intensive of all the stages, with huge speakers, heavy bass, and MCs that freestyle over the music. While other stages focus on the slower, more traditional styles of electronic music such as house, trance, or breaks, this room is dedicated to the electronic music genre drum and bass. This stage is typically hosted by another company founded by Insomniac called 'Bassrush.' Separate Bassrush events are held at various locations nationwide throughout the year. The Queen's Grounds: This room used to hold all of the attractions until 2009 when it became a house-orientated stage. In 2010, it was held in one of the bigger warehouse-like buildings that housed the main stage for 2008's Nocturnal Festival. Not to be confused with Beyond Wonderland's Queen's Domain stage. The Big Top Tent: Another mixed-genre type tent playing host to mostly house. It started off as being one of the only stages held outside in a giant tent. Since 2010, there has been no incarnation of the Big Top Tent. Talent Nocturnal has featured artists from around the world, including Darin Epsilon, Fury, Pretty Lights, R3HAB, The Prototypes, Umek, Calvin Harris, Steve Aoki, Tiesto, Hardwell, Cosmic Gate, Pendulum, EOTO, Borgore, Datsik, Avicii, Kaskade, S.

In 1956, the film was re-released along with Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Plot Prominent criminal attorney Amos Strickland (Nicholas Joy) checks into the Lost Caverns Resort Hotel. His murdered body is later discovered by the bellboy, Freddie Phillips (Lou Costello), who is implicated in the crime. Casey Edwards (Bud Abbott), the house detective, tries to clear Freddie, but Inspector Wellman (James Flavin) and Sgt. Stone (Mikel Conrad) keep him in custody at his hotel room 'on the state'. Strickland's secretary Gregory Millford and seven of Strickland's former clients happen to be at the resort, and they are all suspects. These former clients are Swami Talpur (Boris Karloff), Angela Gordon (Lenore Aubert), Mrs. Hargreave (Victoria Horne), T. Hanley Brooks (Roland Winters), Lawrence Crandall (Harry Hayden), Mrs. Grimsby (Claire DuBrey) and Mike Relia (Vincent Renno). The bodies of Relia and the secretary Gregory Millford are found in Freddie's closet, and he and Casey try to move them and hide them. The former clients gather for a meeting and decide that they must conceal their pasts and that Freddie must take the blame for the three murders. They trick Freddie into signing a confession, and then want him dead. Angela tries to seduce him, but the police stop her when they fear she's poisoned the champagne, then the Swami attempts to hypnotize him into committing suicide but his stupidity saves him. Freddie and the two police officers, in an attempt to draw out the real killer, inform everyone that Freddie is in possession of a blood-stained handkerchief found at the murder scene. Soon afterwards, several attempts to kill Freddie are made, including gunshots at the window of his booby-trapped room, and locking him in a steam cabinet. Eventually Freddie hears a voice that calls him to bring the handkerchief to the Lost Cavern. There he meets up with a masked figure who offers to save him from the hole he has just fallen into in exchange for the handkerchief. Freddie makes the mistake of telling the mysterious figure that he left it in his room. He is left in the hole, but is eventually rescued by the two police officers. Back at the hotel, everyone has gathered together and Sgt. Stone returns with some muddy shoes that belong to Melton (Alan Mowbray), the hotel manager, which proves that he was the one in the caverns with Freddie. His motive for the murder was that he, Relia and Millford, Strickland's secretary, were blackmailing the owner, Mr. Crandell. What the blackmail was for is never explained. When Strickland found out he came to investigate, so Melton killed him. Millford then sent down the former clients to use as decoys for the police, but Melton killed Relia and Millford to cover it all up. He attempts to escape through a window, but is caught by a booby trap previously set by Freddie.

The original script, titled Easy Does It, was written with actor-comedian Bob Hope in mind. However, Universal then purchased the rights and reworked it for Abbott and Costello.Furmanek, Bob and Ron Palumbo (1991). Abbott and Costello in Hollywood. New York: Perigee Books. The role eventually played by Boris Karloff in the film was originally a female character named Madame Switzer in the final shooting script which was then titled, Abbott and Costello Meet the Killers. Five days before shooting, Karloff was hired and the character was changed to a swami. After filming was completed, Costello was bedridden for several months due to a relapse of rheumatic fever, which he originally battled in 1943. As a result, the duo would not make another film together until one year later, 1950's Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion. Boris Karloff's inclusion in the title of the film seems evident from the movie poster, which includes a comma between the words \\"Killer\\" and \\"Boris Karloff\\", but the actual credits in the film show no such distinction, and could be interpreted as \\"Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer\\", followed by the co-star credit \\"Boris Karloff.\\" Alternate versions In Australia and New Zealand, every scene with a corpse was removed prior to distribution. The film was banned in Denmark due to the scene where corpses play cards.

Biography Early life Kitty Kirkpatrick was born on 9 April 1802, in Hyderabad in the State of Hyderabad, a large principality in the southern Indian Subcontinent under British paramountcy. Her father, James Achilles Kirkpatrick, was the British Resident in Hyderabad and a colonel in the British East India Company's army. Her mother, Khair-un- Nissa, was a Hyderabadi noblewoman and a Sayyida, a lineal descendant of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, whose grandfather was the prime minister of Hyderabad. The two had met in the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad, and were married in a Muslim ceremony. James Kirkpatrick, a Christian, underwent some degree of conversion to Islam to be permitted to marry Khair-un-Nissa, but is not clear whether the marriage or the conversion were recognized as legal. Kitty was initially named Noor un-Nissa, Sahib Begum (\\"Little Lady of High Lineage\\") and was raised alongside her brother William (known as Mir Ghulam Ali, Sahib Allum) in the mansion her father built, the British Residency, Hyderabad, living in the zenana with her mother and grandmother. James was a doting father and is known to have spent a lot of time with his wife and small children. In 1805, Kitty and William were sent to live in England at age three and five years, respectively, with their paternal grandfather, Colonel James Kirkpatrick. At the time, it was common for British families in India to send their young children to Europe as death rates for children in India were frighteningly high, and families wanted them to grow up as British, speaking unaccented English and being educated at a British school or by British tutors in a British home, before returning. The well-known painter, George Chinnery, created a portrait of the siblings in Madras, shortly before they were sent to England. The two children were baptised as Christians on 25 March 1805, at St Mary's Church, Marylebone Road in London, and were thereafter known by their new Christian names, William George Kirkpatrick and Katherine Aurora \\"Kitty\\" Kirkpatrick.White mischief, The Guardian, 9 December 2002. They never again saw India or any members of their maternal family. James Kirkpatrick died on 15 October 1805, around 8 months after Kitty and William had left India. In his will, James describes William and Kitty as his \\"natural children,\\" leaving large fortunes to each, and left money to his nieces and nephews, the children of his brother William Kirkpatrick, to whom he was deeply indebted for launching his lucrative career with the East India Company. William Kirkpatrick, who had needed to retire to England mid-career due to poor health, had arranged for James to step into his prestigious and lucrative position as Resident at Hyderabad. James used his fortune to support William Kirkpatrick and his children out of his love for and gratitude toward his elder brother. Following James' death and the absence of her children, Khair- un-Nissa, who had lived in strict purdah during his lifetime, began a relationship with Henry Russell, one of James' assistants. Only 19 years-old at the time, Khair-un-Nissa was abandoned by Russell, destroying her reputation among the Hyderabadi elite and was forced into exile, unable to prevent greedy relatives from taking over the valuable landed estates she had inherited from her father. Life in England A portrait of Katherine Kirkpatrick, ca. 1830 Kitty and her brother William had substantial sums settled on them by their mother, which allowed for them to be raised and educated in middle-class comfort in England. Kitty was educated privately and brought up to emulate the ideal of the Christian lady. In 1812, William suffered a severe burn injury resulted in the amputation of one of his arms, and became reclusive thereafter, though he successfully graduated from Oxford University in 1820, married, and had three daughters before his early death in 1828. Her brother's death, as well as that of her grandfather and other relations, left Kitty with a substantial inheritance estimated at about ¬£50,000. After the death of her grandfather, Kirkpatrick lived with various of her married cousins: Clementina, Lady Louis; Julia, the wife of Edward Strachey; and (Barbara) Isabella, the wife of Charles Buller, a Member of Parliament and mother of Charles Buller junior. Into adulthood Kitty became known for her attractiveness, and in 1822, while staying with the Bullers, she met the Scottish philosopher and historian, Thomas Carlyle, who was then employed as the Buller children's tutor and who swiftly became infatuated with Kirkpatrick. The romance was encouraged by another of Kitty's cousins, Julia (who married Edward Strachey, grandfather of the writer Lytton Strachey). However, Carlyle was impoverished and not believed by the rest of the family to be a suitable match for the wealthy and well-connected Kitty.Anthony Gardner: Author and Journalist - Interviews (Tatler, 2002) Carlyle would later use Kitty as the basis for the Calypso-like Blumine in his novel Sartor Resartus and his memoirs, written many decades later, wrote a pen portrait of Kitty admiring her beauty but is clearly suspicious of her mixed-race ancestry:Colonial Grandeur, The Hindu, 27 February 2005. On 21 November 1829, Kitty married James Winslowe Phillipps (1802-1859), an army officer in the 7th Hussars Regiment, and a member of the Kennaway family, which also had Indian connections. It was evidently a happy marriage, Kirkpatrick and Phillipps went on to have seven children, of whom four survived to adulthood: Mary Augusta (1830-1909), John James (b. 1834), Emily Georgina (b. 1835), and Bertha Elizabeth (1840-1875). Renewed contact with India Kirkpatrick's paternal family had long forbidden her from maintaining any contact with her family in India. However, with the help of Henry Russell, her father's former assistant and her mother's ex-lover, Kirkpatrick was able to re-establish contact with her maternal grandmother after almost four decades of separation. Although they were never physically re-united, the two women were correspondents on a regular and often emotional basis for six years. Kirkpatrick's letters make it clear that despite leaving India and her mother at such a young age, she still retained vivid memories of it: Kirkpatrick died at her home, the Villa Sorrento, in Torquay, Devon, in 1889.

E. B. Griffin, about the United States Army from the Second World War through the Vietnam War. The story centers on the careers of four U.S. Army officers who became lieutenants in the closing stages of World War II and the late 1940s. The series is notable for the amount of attention it does not devote to combat. Rather than skipping forward, it follows the main characters though their peacetime service as the army evolves in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, particularly in the development of Army Aviation and Special Forces.

He resigns while a cadet corporal during his third year at the United States Military Academy (or West Point), to accept a direct commission as a second lieutenant and a German and Russian linguist in the last year of World War II. While doing so, he is instrumental in locating a group of Allied POWs being held by the Russians and assists in their rescue. (One of those POWs was Bob Bellmon, who would become a friend and mentor to Felter.) He subsequently goes to Parachute School and the Ranger course, and serves as a first lieutenant in Greece under Lt. Col. Paul T Hanrahan and with 2nd Lt. Craig W Lowell, who becomes his best friend. Afterwards, Felter serves in Berlin as an intelligence officer. While stationed there, he discovers the whereabouts of Oberst Graf von Grieffenberg and arranges his repatriation. The Graf and Felter become close personal friends, which gives him a direct line into West German intelligence. During the Korean War, he commands a covert, behind-the-lines operation with Captain Rudolph G. MacMillan, earning a Distinguished Service Cross for his combat valor. Felter subsequently becomes a counselor to the president for four U.S. presidents, from Eisenhower through Nixon. Though Felter tries several times to return to the conventional army, he is kept on in his role as Counselor to the President due to his uncanny ability to correctly predict the actions of the nation's enemies and to spot trouble before it happens. Perhaps the best example of this is Operation Earnest, a Special Forces mission authorized by President Johnson and commanded by Felter that prevented Che Guevara from taking over the Republic of the Congo as his first step in taking over South America. In the books, Felter is respected, feared, and even hated because of the clout he wields with the President and his analytical and espionage abilities, as he usually has information before anyone else and is sometimes the only one to analyze that information correctly. Despite his short stature and unimposing appearance (earning him the nickname, \\"Mouse\\"), he is a highly capable, even ruthless, officer. Felter is an expert in tactics and one of the most combat-effective characters in the series. He prefers short range weapons such as the M1911 pistol, the Winchester Model 1897 12 gauge pump shotgun, and the Thompson submachine gun. He is literally a dead shot with the M1911, using a two hand stance long before this was the norm. In the Epilogue of The Generals, Felter reaches the rank of lieutenant general, and ends his career as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Colonel Rudolph George \\"Mac\\" MacMillan, USA Mac MacMillan was a Regular Army Sergeant assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, who received a battlefield commission while participating in Operation Market Garden, although he was taken prisoner before he learned of it. For his actions in that abortive river crossing, he was later awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry Truman. He was the senior NCO of the prisoners of war in the same POW camp as Bob Bellmon and after the officers were removed from the camp, organized a successful mass escape ahead of the invading Russians, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. As a former NCO with a tenth grade education, he doesn't always think very far ahead, but he is a survivor and knows ways to get things done in his recurring role as an aide-de-camp. MacMillan qualifies as an aviator prior to the Korean War, although his flying escapades are limited largely to The Captains. He works with Mouse Felter running Task Force Able, an intelligence-gathering and sabotage operation, in the Korean War. MacMillan is better off financially than many suspect. He is a silent partner with his brother in an automobile dealership in Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania and also in a truck stop they jointly own. However, he much prefers life as an army officer, and because of his Medal of Honor can pretty much serve for as long as he chooses. Following an altercation with another officer in an officers' club in the pages of The Colonels, Mac is assigned as Red Hanrahan's deputy at the Special Warfare Center. Mac dies, apparently of a stroke, in the final pages of The Generals during Operation Monte Cristo, a raid to rescue American prisoners of war held by the North Vietnamese. The Epilogue to The Generals says he is buried, with full military honors, in Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania. His wife Roxanne (\\"Roxy\\") responded to President Jimmy Carter's granting amnesty to the Vietnam War-era draft dodgers by sending him all of Mac's medals, including his Medal of Honor, accompanied by a nasty letter. They were returned to her by the White House along with a form letter stating that the President could not accept a present of any military medals, no matter the motivation of the sender. Colonel Craig W. Lowell, USA Craig Lowell is an extremely wealthy Harvard drop-out (he was actually expelled) who was drafted and sent to the US occupation forces in Germany, where his duties include being the Constabulary golf pro. Because of his polo-playing skills, he, as a Private First Class, was assigned to manage the polo team for the commanding general, \\"Porky\\" Waterford. Since he was essential to the general's team, and since a game against the French could only be played by officers, the General orders Mac MacMillan to get Lowell commissioned before the game. He is commissioned into the Finance Corps and detailed Armor. When the general dies during the polo match, General Waterford's replacement, disgusted by the direct commissioning of Lowell just to play polo (which the replacement views as a breach of military ethics) uses Lowell to fill a levy for an advisor to the Greek Army in the Greek Civil War, since Lowell had not been an officer long enough to rate an efficiency report and the colonel in question did not want to go to the trouble of convening a board of officers to throw him out of the army. There, Lowell meets Sandy Felter and serves under Paul \\"Red\\" Hanrahan. During heavy action in which all of the Greek officers and many soldiers in the unit to which Lowell is assigned are killed, despite serious wounds Lowell takes command and the survivors successfully hold the position. He is eventually awarded the (fictional) Order of St. George and St. Andrew, the highest award for bravery that Greece can bestow on a foreigner. When he is medevacked to Germany, he marries Ilse von Grieffenberg, whom he had known in both the literal and Biblical senses before his assignment to the Military Assistance Advisory Group Greece. Upon his return to the US, Lowell remains in the army for a couple of years until his service obligation expires, most of the time at the Armor Board at Fort Knox working on the M3 90mm high velocity tank gun project. His son Peter-Paul was born at Knox, and he makes a close friend in Philip Sheriden Parker IV, his roommate during the Basic Officer's Course. After being released from active duty, Lowell is accepted to, and graduates with a master's degree from, the Wharton School of Business without first having attaining a baccalaureate degree, normally a prerequisite for attending Wharton. (One of the other characters observes that Wharton apparently makes exceptions for people who own banks.) While there, he joins the Pennsylvania Army National Guard where he is given command of a tank company and a promotion to captain. He is one of the first officers recalled to active duty when the Korean War breaks out. In Korea, Lowell commands an element of the (fictional) 73rd Heavy Tank Battalion, \\"Task Force Lowell\\", so well that he is promoted to major at the age of 24 and rewarded with a Distinguished Service Cross. Task Force Lowell spearheaded the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter and made a deep strike far behind the North Korean lines, disrupting their supply chain and forcing the diversion of forces to deal with \\"the Duke,\\" the nickname given him by his men. Upon returning to the United States, Lowell attends the Advanced Armor Officer's course at Fort Knox, where one of his studies (in a Kafkaesque twist) includes analyzing and recommending improvements to the organization and operations of Task Force Lowell in Korea. He privately tells Phil Parker that he felt he did it correctly the first time. An incident with a visiting movie star in Korea, his appearing as a witness for the defense of Phil Parker during Parker's murder trial, his smart mouth, and a penchant for circumventing the rules when it suits him all hurt Lowell's career. When the Duke is given a series of dead-end assignments to encourage him to resign his commission, he transfers to Army Aviation. Working independently, he begins developing combat tactics for the improved helicopters he is sure are in the equipment pipeline. Lowell singlehandedly saves the army's tank-busting helicopter project (and coincidentally, his career) by destroying half a dozen captured Soviet T-34 tanks at Ed Greer's funeral after Greer was killed by malfunctioning ordnance when the project was unveiled. He is finally promoted to lieutenant colonel, after rescuing Sandy Felter and an \\"A\\" Team during the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. His promotion was personally ordered by President Kennedy as a reward for rescuing Felter. At the same time, he acquires a \\"rabbi\\" in General E.Z. Black, who oversees an officer he regards as brilliant if unorthodox. Around the same time, Lowell was caught up in \\"Operation Bootstrap.\\" Army regulations required that commissioned officers hold bachelor's degrees. (There are exceptions, but very few.) A number of good officers did not have such degrees; so the army sent them, still on active duty and all expenses paid, to college for up to two years to get one. Lowell went to Norwich University in Vermont and in 18 months took a bachelors, summa cum laude, in Foreign Languages (German and Russian), while continuing to work for Army Aviation on the q.t. in his spare time. General Bellmon (who regarded Operation Bootstrap as idiotic) recounted the story of going to visit Craig in Vermont to buck him up, and finding him on the ski slopes dressed in the height of European skiing fashion, surrounded by bevies of admiring snow bunnies.Griffin, W.E.B. The Brotherhood of War: The Aviators (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons), 1988. An accomplished though reluctant staff officer, Lowell was instrumental in the formation of the army's first airmobile division, the First Air Cavalry Division. At the insistence of General Howard, Lowell was given a command in the First Air Cav. His administrative skills, along with his planning ability and superb combat leadership, make him an invaluable asset to almost every unit to which he is assigned. Lowell is also described as quite the \\"guardhouse lawyer\\" who knows how to manipulate the rules, use his rank, and turn situations to his advantage. The fact that the Duke is also Special Forces qualified, having earned his Green Beret in Greece by \\"on the job training,\\" influences his assignments from time to time. The Generals barely addresses Lowell's two full tours in Vietnam, first in command of an aviation battalion where his performance earned him a second award of the Distinguished Service Cross, several Air Medals and a promotion to full colonel; and a second tour in command of an aviation group (brigade) where several helicopters were shot out from under him. His last assignment is as tactical commander of a mission to rescue POWs from the Song Tay POW camp. Because of his involvement with a prisoner of war's wife, he was involuntarily retired upon his return from the successful mission (see below). Though Lowell spends most of the series as a reputed ladies' man, he was a faithful and devoted husband and father to Ilse von Greiffenberg Lowell and their son, \\"P.P.\\" (Peter-Paul), until Ilse was killed in a car accident while Lowell was serving in Korea. Lowell's escapades with women nearly cost him his career more than once. His most notable affairs included Georgia Page, a Hollywood starlet whom he took to the front lines and with whom he allegedly had sex in a tank; Jane Cassidy, his married secretary, while stationed at Fort Rucker; and Cynthia Thomas, a wealthy journalist to whom he became engaged. Cynthia left Lowell at the altar, realizing that though she loved him deeply, they lived in two very different worlds that did not overlap and if they were foolish enough to marry, they would soon come to hate each other when one was forced to give up a career they loved. His last affair, with Dorothy Sims, wife of an Air Force POW in Vietnam, was so far beyond acceptable military behavior that Lowell was immediately retired upon his return from Operation Monte Cristo despite its success. After Dorothy divorced her repatriated husband (something she had been planning to do before he was shot down), she and the Duke quietly married and have lived together monogamously ever since. Lowell was admired and respected by the soldiers who served with him, though some more traditional officers, such as Bob Bellmon and Bill Roberts, dislike Lowell because of his apparent womanizing (according to Barbara Bellmon, Craig Lowell has never seduced a woman and does not always have the sense to say no when he really ought to; women are always portrayed as seducing him) and his disregard for the rules in favor of obtaining results. Nonetheless, they all have grudging respect for both his administrative skills and his demonstrated abilities as a warrior. Colonel Phillip Sheridan Parker IV, USA A 1946 graduate of Norwich University, Phil Sheridan is a 5th-generation Army officer. Moses Parker, who named his son after his commander, General Phillip Sheridan, then the four PS Parkers. His great-great-grandfather was a member of the Tenth Cavalry, a distinguished unit of African-American soldiers known as the Buffalo Soldiers. Like his father, Phil IV began his career serving as an Armor officer. He commands a tank company with distinction in Korea, though his record is marred by an incident wherein Parker shoots a cowardly fellow officer. Because Parker is black, he knows he has to be the best in every class to stay even with the others in an army just beginning desegregation. He begins a lifelong friendship with Craig Lowell while attending the same Basic Armor Officer's course at Fort Knox (as told in Book I: The Lieutenants), where Parker is the top graduate, and Lowell is second in the class. However, Parker's friendship with Lowell often works against Parker's career. Additionally, Parker's career is very nearly ended by the shooting incident in Korea, for which he is charged with murder. He is subsequently acquitted of the charge with the help of testimony given by Lowell, but both men are branded as troublemakers. Following their graduation from the Armor School, both are given dead-end assignments, but the intervention of a senator (at Lowell's cousin's suggestion) helps revive their careers. Parker is recruited to Army Aviation by then-Colonel Bill Roberts and becomes dual-qualified to fly both fixed wing and rotary aircraft. Parker remains a captain for over 15 years, which he assumes is the result of the Korea incident. Frustrated by his lack of advancement, Parker volunteers for the Green Berets and is accepted by General Paul Hanrahan. Shortly thereafter, it is discovered that Parker's promotion has been held up by a freak clerical error, and he is promoted to major. Given the option to leave Special Forces once he has been promoted, Parker elects to stay and heads the de facto aviation section of Special Forces in its early days. He marries Antoinette Parker, a doctor and former associate professor of pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital, at the end of Book II: The Captains. To be with her husband, Toni becomes a contract surgeon with the army and is almost always able to arrange to be assigned to the hospitals on the bases where Phil is stationed. Parker is sent to Vietnam as an aviator and becomes a Prisoner of War through an act of sabotage on his OV-1 Mohawk (as told in Book VI: The Generals). Parker is ultimately rescued from a prisoner of war camp during a daring mission commanded by Lowell. Following his retirement from the army, he returns to Norwich as the Petrofsky Professor of Military History, a chair endowed (though the book does not say so, no other character had the necessary information about Petrofsky and the funds to do it) by Geoff Craig. Supporting cast of characters Lieutenant General Robert F. Bellmon, USA Bob Bellmon, USMA '39, the son of one general and the son-in-law of another (Porky Waterford), is a quintessential career army officer. As a very young armor Lt. Col in the Army of the United States he is captured at the battle of Kasserine Pass. As a POW of the Germans in Poland, he is executive officer of the prisoner detachment and its de facto commander. While a prisoner in the stalag commanded by Oberst Graf von Grieffennerg, he gave the Oberst his parole, was taken to the site of the Katyn Forest massacre, and entrusted with evidence proving the Soviets had committed the atrocity, requesting that he get it to the Western Allies, which he eventually did. After his rescue from the Russians by Task Force Parker, Bellmon was repatriated to the United States and reduced in grade to major as part of the army's draw-down following World War II. Bellmon shifted from Armor to Army Aviation in time to be part of its expansion into a combat arm, was quickly promoted, and eventually became the Commanding General of the Army Aviation base at Fort Rucker. He later commanded the XVIIIth Airborne Corps in one of his final assignments. While he is portrayed as a bit of a stuffed shirt who has a problem with officers who don't go by the book (particularly Green Berets), there is no doubt as to his abilities and his devotion to the US Army. The Bellmons are well-off financially. The Waterfords owned a substantial amount of property on the California coast near Carmel before selling it off at high prices, and Barbara inherited that money. The Bellmons own a large farm in Virginia, long since paid for, and continue to receive money from the crops grown on the farm, much of which has been invested in stocks and bonds. In The New Breed, it is observed that the income from the Bellmon/Waterford investments is much greater than his salary as a general officer. It is for this reason Bob and Barbara Bellmon are able to relate effectively to Craig Lowell. Although there is four grades-worth of difference in rank between him and Sandy Felter, Bellmon and Felter become good friends, to the point his children refer to Felter as \\"Uncle Sandy.\\" He watched over Felter's career until the Mouse became a counselor to the president in Eisenhower's presidency, and Kennedy's, Johnson's, and Nixon's after that. Despite the disparity in their ranks, and particularly when Felter is acting as the Action Officer for secret missions like Operation Dragon Rouge, Operation Earnest, and Operation Monte Cristo, he treats Felter as an equal as well as a friend. The General Robert F. Bellmon character in part resembles General John K. Waters, who was the real life son-in-law of Patton and a POW in Germany after he was taken prisoner while fighting in Tunisia, in 1943. Major General Paul T. \\"Red\\" Hanrahan, USA One of the original Airborne officers before the war (despite his fear of parachuting; Mac MacMillan had to push him out the door on his first jump), Red Hanrahan served in the OSS in Greece during World War II, nominally as a Signal Corps Officer. He twice parachuted behind enemy lines to join the partisans during the war, and wears two combat stars on his jump wings. He served as Felter's and Lowell's commanding officer when they were advisors during the Greek Civil War. He is an advocate of the concept of using Special Forces to train and assist allies in fighting their own wars. During the French war in Indochina, Hanrahan was assigned as a military attache in Saigon and narrowly avoids an ambush that would have killed him and his family, who were with him on the assignment. His reports on what the French and the Viet Minh were doing were received at the highest levels of the army, and led to his next assignment. (Mouse Felter had a great deal to do with it, arranging for President Eisenhower to send his name to the Senate for confirmation as a full colonel.) Colonel Hanrahan was named Commandant of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg. He remains there for the rest of his career, fighting with the regular army establishment to make them understand that what the Green Berets do is unorthodox by regular army standards, but is as important as what the other combat branches do. He is promoted to the rank of brigadier general by President Kennedy, and later to major general by either Johnson or Nixon. By the time Operation Monte Cristo is staged, he is a major general (as established in the beginning of The Generals). In the Epilogue to The Generals, it is established that General Hanrahan retired from the army shortly after the end of the Vietnam War. He went on to a second career as a professor of Romance languages at a college in upstate New York. Hanrahan's real-life counterpart as the Special Forces Commandant during that era was then-Brigadier General William P. Yarborough, who arranged for President Kennedy to approve the famed green berets worn by Special Forces. Barbara Waterford Bellmon The daughter of General Porky Waterford, Barbara is the classic officer's wife, assisting with the families of her husband's command. She is amused by some of the junior officers and often reminds her husband to relax a little with them. Other characters in the series describe her as \\"the perfect officer's wife.\\" She has two children, Marjorie (who eventually marries Jacques Portet) and Robert, a West Pointer and army aviator qualified in rotary and fixed wing aircraft. She is tremendously fond of Craig Lowell and treats him as a little brother, including organizing his (aborted) marriage to Cynthia Thomas. After Bellmon's death, she becomes a Congresswoman from California, where their home is located. Colonel Phillip Sheridan Parker III, USA, Retired A Norwich graduate, before the war Colonel Parker III was the last Commandant of the Equestrian School at Fort Riley. During the war, he commanded a colored tank destroyer regiment in North Africa and Northern Europe under General \\"Porky\\" Waterford. Without orders, he led the task force that rescued Bob Bellmon. General Waterford once told his son-in- law Bob Bellmon that \\"You owe Phil Parker, Bob. That operation he mounted to go get you cost him his star.\\" He is a soldier's soldier. A stiff, starchy man, the Colonel is one of the few Regular Army Establishment officers respected by Craig Lowell. Since his retirement, he trains hunting dogs and spends a great deal of time hunting and fishing. Generalleutnant Graf Peter Paul von Greiffenberg A member of the German professional officer corps, as an Oberst he is made commandant of the POW camp where Bob Bellmon is held. Von Greiffenberg had been wounded while commanding a regiment and was relegated to this duty. While commandant of the camp, after receiving Bellmon's parole he takes him to the site of the Katyn Forest massacre of Polish officers by the Soviets and provides him with evidence that it was the Russians and not the Germans who murdered the Poles, requesting that he get it to the Western Allies. For nearly five years after the war he was a prisoner in a Russian Gulag, and was identified and repatriated by Sandy Felter, whereupon von Greiffenberg found his daughter had married Craig Lowell and had a son named Peter Paul. According to the books, von Greiffenberg is one of the few German officers who had participated in the Stauffenberg plot to kill Hitler whose involvement remained undiscovered. After the war, he becomes the head of West German intelligence. He is a close friend of Sandy Felter and regards Craig Lowell as a son, his own having been killed during the war. Lowell's son Peter-Paul lives with him at Schloss Greiffenberg until the two of them have a falling-out over American participation in the Vietnam War. In the Epilogue of The Generals, it is established that a rapprochement between the Graf and his grandson was arranged by Ursula Craig during the Graf's final illness. Ilse von Greiffenberg Lowell Ilse is Graf von Greiffenberg's daughter and becomes Craig Lowell's wife following his return from Greece. When Ilse joins Craig at Fort Knox, she is befriended by Barbara and Bob Bellmon, who are also assigned there. In addition to having been her father's captor during the war, Bob Bellmon and Graf von Grieffenberg had been students at the French Army cavalry school at Saumur together and the families grew close. Her entry into the Lowell family is not as smooth. Craig's alcoholic mother calls her a whore and golddigger and at first refuses to accept her, though Craig's cousin Porter and his wife Helene do. Eventually, following a sharp confrontation with her son, Craig's mother grudgingly accepts Ilse as her son's wife and the mother of her grandchild, though no love is lost between the two women; Ilse can be as hardheaded as an army mule and never forgot the scene when they first met or what she was called by her mother-in-law. She is killed in an automobile accident in Germany caused by a drunken US Army Quartermaster Officer, while Craig is in Korea. Ilse was interred in the family crypt at Schloss von Grieffenberg near Marberg an der Lahn, West Germany. Major George Washington \\"Father\\" Lunsford, USA A native of Philadelphia, G.W. Lunsford entered the army upon his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania. Youngest of four children, he comes from a family of doctors; his father and oldest brother are surgeons, his second brother is a psychiatrist, and his leftist sister holds a Ph.D. from and is a professor at Swarthmore College, which Father refers to as \\"Joseph Stalin U.\\" A talented, black Special Forces officer, Lunsford served a tour in Vietnam in command of an A Team, where he came to know then-Lieutenant John Oliver, who flies Father and his A Team in and out of Laos on classified missions using an innovative insertion technique developed by the two of them.Griffin, The Aviators. Wounded on one such mission, when Oliver takes command of the team and leads them out of Laos, he recommends Oliver for the Silver Star and the Combat Infantry Badge. His proficiency in Swahili allows him to play a key role in support of operations in the Congo. He spent almost half a year in his own words, \\"running around in the bush with the Simbas,\\" during which time he would have been tortured to death had his true identity been discovered. When the Simbas captured Stanleyville, Lunsford made his way to the apartment building where Hanni Portet, Ursula Craig, and Jeffy Craig are sheltering after being stranded by Sabena Airlines and protects them from the rebels. He becomes a good friend to John Oliver and Jacques Portet as a result. President Lyndon Johnson personally decorated him for his service in the Congo Crisis with a Silver Star (his third). After his repatriation to the United States following Operation Dragon Rouge and his eventual release from the hospital (he was suffering from intestinal parasites and a couple of rare African diseases) and his promotion to major, he is tasked by General Hanrahan with creating a team of exclusively black Green Berets that can defeat the Simba rebels. Along the way, that mission is expanded by Counselor to the President Sandy Felter to become Operation Earnest. Operation Earnest is the defeating of Che Guevara's goal of first, taking over the Simba rebellion and second, taking over the Congo and turning it into a Communist state. He meets and later marries his wife, Cecilia Taylor, a CIA agent and the station chief first in Rwanda, and later in the Congo, while commanding Special Forces Detachment 17 in the Congo. He is instrumental in thwarting Che's attempt to prove himself as The Great Revolutionary Leader in the Congo, running him out of the country with his tail between his legs as an utter failure. General Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu comes to know Lunsford and in addition to cooperating with the work of SF Detachment 17, decorates Lunsford for his work in combating the Simbas. He and several alumni of Special Detachment 17 follow Guevara to Bolivia and observe his efforts to establish a revolutionary organization there. Despite orders from President Johnson that Guevara is to be kept alive (Johnson has come around to Mouse Felter's opinion that Guevara alive as a Communist failure will be less trouble than as a martyred revolutionary), they are unable to prevent Che's execution by the Bolivian government. Lunsford appears in The Aviators, The New Breed, and Special Ops. Nothing is known of his career following Guevara's execution. It may be presumed that Lunsford remains in Special Forces. However, it is also possible he went on to a second career with the CIA. During the run-up to Operation Earnest, the CIA station chief in Buenos Aires told him that he knew how he'd come to receive his third Silver Star, and that \\"If you ever want to change employers, give me a call.\\" Brigadier General [Select] Geoff Craig, USA Craig Lowell's cousin (see Porter Craig; Other notable characters), Geoff Craig was drafted into the army at the end of his junior year at PrincetonGriffin, W.E.B. The Brotherhood of War: The Berets (New York: Jove Books), 1985. and sent to the stockade after assaulting his basic training NCO (in response to being hit first by the sergeant). Craig Lowell was able to get him into the Special Forces Basic Course, where on completion of the course Geoff was given a promotion to Sergeant. While in Vietnam, Geoff received a battlefield commission after taking command of a Special Forces base during a Vietcong assault when all the officers and noncoms senior to him were killed or wounded. During the Basic Course, he began a relationship with Karl-Heinz Wagner's sister Ursula. They married when he finished the course and his family accepted her, with his cousin Craig smoothing the way for them. Craig Lowell served as best man, and Sandy Felter gave the bride away in the absence of her brother. After Vietnam, he became an aviator, qualifying in both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. He is temporarily assigned to Special Forces Detachment 17 during Operation Earnest and is instrumental in interdicting the Cuban attempts to resupply the Simbas. After Vietnam, his assignments are not discussed, save for the fact that he commanded an Airborne regiment that jumped into Grenada as part of Operation Urgent Fury, as mentioned in the Epilogue to The Generals. As an aviator and brigadier general in the Pentagon in Washington, he plays a critical role in army aviation and with covert operations around the world. 1st Lieutenant Jacques Emile \\"Jack\\" Portet, USAR The American-born son of a commercial airline pilot from the former Belgian Congo, Jacques Portet was born in the United States. Following the death of his mother and before his father's remarriage, he was raised by an aunt and uncle in St. Louis. He was educated at the Culver Military Academy and is a graduate of the Free University of Brussels with a degree in history. Portet was drafted into the army in 1963 and initially trained as an 11-Mike mechanized infantryman despite his qualifications as a commercial pilot and his fluency in Swahili and several other African languages. He volunteers for jump school, qualifies as a parachutist, and is recruited by Sandy Felter as an expert on the Congo. He qualifies as a Green Beret in what is described by General Hanrahan as a \\"jackleg course\\" prior to Operation Dragon Rouge, a joint Belgian-American mission to rescue civilians threatened by the Simba rebels in the Congo. Ignoring orders to the contrary, he jumps with the Belgian paratroopers to rescue his mother, sister, and Ursula and Jeffy Craig; and is later decorated by the Belgians, the Congolese, and the army for his valor. He is an accomplished aviator, whose knowledge of sub-Saharan Africa, its people, and fluency in Swahili is substantial. His connections in the business and political community of the Congo proves invaluable in Operation Earnest, the preventing of Che Guevara's taking over the Congo, as detailed in The Aviators, Special Ops, and The New Breed. He meets and later marries the Bellmons' daughter Marjorie, and much to her dismay accepts a direct commission in the Army Reserve, though she quickly comes to terms with it. (She wanted him safe and sound at the Instrument Examination Board, not heading off into a war zone.) He and Father Lunsford later are involved in a mission to observe Che Guevara's attempt to foment revolt in Bolivia. Nothing is known of Portet's later career, but it seems unlikely that he returned to the Congo following his military service. His father sold the family home in the Congo and his company, Air Simba. The family resettled near Key West and Captain Portet the elder set up an air freight company that the CIA hoped (and failed) to use as a less obvious version of Air America. The deal was brokered by Porter Craig, who outmaneuvered the agency operatives trying to take over Intercontinental Air Cargo. Captain John S. Oliver Jr., USA A Norwich University graduate, Captain Oliver served in Vietnam, commanding the 170th Assault Helicopter Company as a First Lieutenant (in a berth the TO&E; requires be filled by a field grade officer) until relieved after a couple of months by a major. He earned the Combat Infantryman Badge during a Special Forces operation where his helicopter was shot down. As the only unwounded officer, he took command and led the Green Beret A-Team to safety through the jungle, for which he was awarded the Silver Star and unusually for an aviator, the Combat Infantry Badge. He served as General Bellmon's aide-de-camp while stationed at Fort Rucker. General Bellmon had hoped that Johnny might marry Marjorie, but the two became close friends instead. The General keeps an eye on his career and is Johnny's mentor in the army. He eventually marries Liza Wood, the widow of a flight school classmate who was killed in Vietnam after overcoming Liza's conflict between loving him and hating the fact he might die in the nation's service. Like Bellmon, Lowell, and his buddy Geoff Craig, Johnny Oliver is well off. In his case, his wealth was inherited. His father had built a successful truck stop in Vermont, and the will specified that either his much older sister or Johnny could buy the other out if one made an offer to the other by paying the amount of the offer in cash. When his sister, whose husband managed the place, made such an offer in an attempt to buy the truck stop out from under him for about 10% of its fair market value, Oliver consulted Craig Lowell, who put one of his investment bank's real estate lawyers onto the case. Discovering that clause, Craig, Powell, Kenyon & Dawes loaned Oliver the money to buy out his sister, who went berserk at being out- conned. The settlement eventually reached between the siblings left Johnny a multi-millionaire (in 1960s dollars). However, like the other wealthy soldiers in the series, all Johnny wants to do is continue his career as a military officer. His last reported assignment was as commanding officer of a Special Forces unit assigned to train a Bolivian ranger battalion. Griffin, W.E.B. Special Ops (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons), 2001, page 658. Sharon Felter Sharon is Sandy Felter's wife; they have been committed to each other since high school. Initially, she hated Sandy for wanting to be a soldier but has come to love the life they have. Later in the series, she wishes Sandy were a regular soldier but understands his importance to the President. Sandy's role as an intelligence officer leaves her yearning for a life like her friends'. She helped bury Craig Lowell's wife, Ilse, when Lowell was in Korea. When Sandy was believed to have died in a plane crash at Dien Bien Phu, she helped comfort Lowell (when he should have been comforting her) when he was sent to notify her Felter was missing and presumed lost. She, and Barbara Bellmon, both regard Lowell as a mischievous younger brother. Lowell regards Sharon more fondly than any other woman in his life and often jokes that if anything were to happen to Sandy he would quickly propose, telling one friend that he frequently considers running Sandy over with a truck so he could marry the widow.  Dorothy Sims  A wife of a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War and an activist for POW families as well as an advocate for the return of the prisoners being held by the North Vietnamese, Dorothy becomes involved with Craig Lowell. They fell in love during the run-up to Operation Monte Cristo and married after she divorces her husband, Colonel Thomas Sims, USAF, whom Craig rescued from a POW camp. His relationship with Dorothy cost Craig his career, but following his involuntary retirement the couple share a long and loving marriage. They travel the world and enjoy life.  Other notable characters  *General E. Z. Black ‚Äì Armor officer, division and corps commander in Korea (see I. D. White). Later served as vice chief of staff and CINCPAC. Longtime protector of Mac MacMillan (The Captains, The Colonels); also the officer who rescued Craig Lowell's career at the end of The Majors. He later specifically requested Lowell for a difficult assignment in the early days of Vietnam, and rewarded him for it with a Legion of Merit. Black was responsible for Lowell's assignment to a combat command when the First Air Cavalry Division was activated. *Porter Craig ‚Äì Craig Lowell's cousin and father of Geoffrey Craig; Porter is the chairman of the board of the Lowell/Craig family firm of investment bankers, Craig, Powell, Kenyon, and Dawes. In the early books of the series, their relationship is somewhat adversarial and strained, as they are forced to share equal interest in the firm. By the later books their relationship has warmed, and they are quite fond of each other. Porter and his wife, Helene, sort of adopt the Portet family after Jack Portet rescues Hanni, Ursula, and Jiffy from the Simbas, breaking a family rule and selling them a family mansion. Porter later assists Captain Portet in setting up Air Intercontinental Cargo, negotiating a deal with the CIA's bank so brilliant that Craig Lowell says he got both ears and the tail, because the CIA is financing the airline but can't get control of it. *Lieutenant Commander Edward Eaglebury, USN ‚Äì Naval intelligence officer and aviator assigned to U.S. Army Special Forces; disguised as an army sergeant first class, he served as Tom Ellis' tormentor during the latter's Green Beret training cycle (featured in The Colonels). Commander Eaglebury was killed while looking for missile sites in Cuba during the crisis. He was decorated posthumously with the Distinguished Service Cross by President Kennedy for his actions in The Berets. *1st Lieutenant Tom Ellis ‚Äì Airborne and later Green Beret officer (introduced in The Colonels, featured in The Berets). Tom Ellis was an OCS graduate who enlisted to be a cook and then went to Officer Candidate and Airborne Schools at Ft. Benning, Ga. to avoid the kitchen. He was picked up by Col. MacMillan while hitchhiking to Ft. Bragg because he had lost his car playing poker. Served as aide to Paul Hanrahan after Hanrahan's promotion to brigadier general. Commanded the \\"A\\" Team picked up by Craig Lowell in Cuba. Died after stepping on a Punji stick while leading an unauthorized patrol in Vietnam, while acting as an officer courier. Went AWOL in returning to the United States rather than undergoing proper medical care for his infections in Vietnam. *Major William Franklin ‚Äì Early army warrant officer aviator. An African-American, he met and became friends with Craig Lowell while both served as observers to the French army in the Algerian campaigns. At first Franklin was a photographer only. With a little \\"bootleg\\" flight training from Lowell he discovers a love of aviation and becomes a pilot himself. He briefly leaves the army mid-career but quickly loses interest in life as a civilian photographer and returns. He is promoted from warrant officer to lieutenant for his role assisting Lowell in rescuing Felter from the Bay of Pigs. *1st Lieutenant Ed C. Greer ‚Äì Early army warrant officer aviator (featured in The Majors). Former assistant to Gen. E. Z. Black. While serving as Black's \\"eyes and ears\\" on a secret mission with MacMillan and Felter to Dien Bien Phu, their plane is shot down on approach to the base. He saves MacMillan from Viet Minh capture or death as they begin an overland odyssey to safety. Later sent by Black to Warrant Officer Candidate (WOC) school at Ft. Rucker to learn how to fly, he served in Algeria after Craig Lowell and Bill Franklin. Married Melody Dutton, daughter of a banker in Dothan, Alabama, home of Fort Rucker. Pilot of the ill-fated H-19 \\"Big Bad Bird\\" tank-busting helicopter, he dies as a result of malfunctioning ordnance. *Major General Paul T. Jiggs ‚Äì army armor officer and aviation convert; Served as Craig Lowell's CO with the 73rd Heavy Tank in Korea and later became the commanding general of Ft. Rucker. Jiggs is one of Lowell's biggest supporters among the general officers and serves as a mentor. *Major General Angus C. \\"Scotty\\" Laird ‚Äì army general and aviation convert (Introduced in The Majors) (see also Bogardus S. Cairns and Cairns Army Airfield#History). Dies as a result of pilot error; Lt. Greer sees the crash and attempts to rescue him, but is too late. *Colonel William R. Roberts ‚Äì West Point graduate (Class of '40), longtime army aviation visionary and promoter. Frequently at odds with Bob Bellmon. Colonel, later Brigadier General Roberts, was one of the first army aviators and went through the first army aviation class before they numbered them ‚Äî \\"The Class Before One\\". The character is possibly inspired by General Robert B. Williams. *Peter-Paul von Greiffenberg Lowell ‚Äì Son of Craig W. Lowell and Ilse von Greiffenberg. Born at Ft. Knox when his father attended the Basic Officer Course. After his grandfather, the Graf Peter Paul von Greiffenberg, was freed from a Siberian Prison Camp, he and his mother lived with the Graf along with other members the von Greiffenberg family in Germany. When his mother was killed in the car accident, he was taken care of by his grandfather and the women of the family. Peter and his father, Craig, had an in and out relationship as his father devotion was to the army most of his childhood. In later years, Peter-Paul became a journalist with a leftist bent. He and his father had a falling out in \\"The Generals\\", after a conflict of interest over the confidentiality of Operation Monte Cristo, that almost saw him thrown out of a helicopter for refusing to turn over the evidence he had accumulated concerning the op. (Before that, Peter-Paul was estranged from Colonel Lowell because he had renounced his American citizenship to avoid service in Vietnam, able to do so because of his mother's German citizenship.) He also became estranged from his grandfather, Generalleutnant Graf von Greiffenberg, despite being the Graf's heir to his title. due to his political views. He was reconciled with the Graf shortly before the Graf's passing in a meeting arranged by Ursula Craig. Graf Peter-Paul Lowell von Greiffenberg is married and has one son, who is styled the Baron von Kolberg. *Karl Wagner ‚Äì Born in East Germany, Wagner served in the Pioneer Corps (combat engineers) of the East German Army, rising to the rank of Oberleutnant (first lieutenant). Assigned to a unit tasked with making improvements to the Berlin Wall, this crystallized his disenchantment with the East German regime. He escaped to the West by ordering his men to stack bags of cement in an army truck to form a barrier-cum-foxhole, putting his sister Ursula in the back, and crashing through a stretch of the Wall where he knew the mines had been removed and the concrete barrier wall had not yet been installed. After being cleared by US Army Counterintelligence, he and Ursula were flown to the United States, where he enlisted in the Army. Making PFC as the honor graduate of his company, he applied for and was accepted for Special Forces training, where he and Ursula met then-Private Geoffrey Craig. Graduated early from the SF Basic Course, he came to the attention of Sandy Felter, which had effects on his later career. Following a tour in Vietnam and going through Officers Candidate School to be commissioned as a lieutenant, Felter sent him undercover with the noted mercenary Colonel Michael \\"Mad Mike\\" Hoare, becoming a Captain in the Katangese Special Gendarmerie during the suppression of the Simba Uprising in the Congo, in conjunction with Operation Earnest. The books are silent on his assignments after this, but in The Generals it was established that he had done at least one more tour in Vietnam, during which he was wounded and paralyzed from the waist down. He was medically retired from the Army because of this. Geoff Craig noted he seldom visits his brother-in-law because Karl keeps asking Geoff \\"to buy him a pistol. He does not like being a paraplegic.\\"Griffin, The Generals. Inconsistencies and historical integration *Repeated references are made to the \\"Expert Combat Infantryman Badge\\", though no such award exists. The army awards the Combat Infantryman Badge or the Expert Infantryman Badge. *In The Lieutenants, Stalag XVII-B is erroneously located some 5 miles south of Szczecin (today it is a Polish city); another erroneous reference locates the camp in a former Cavalry barracks from the Polish Army (before World War II Szczecin was part of Germany, so there was no cavalry barracks of the Polish Army near the city). The real location of Stalag XVII-B was not in Pomerania, as described in the book. Among other mistakes when using German phrases and abbreviations Griffin took the wrong denomination for the mentioned POW camp. Stalag is an abbreviation for Stammlager, referring to camps for enlisted personnel. Officers were imprisoned in an Offlag (abbreviation for Offizierslager).https://www.historyonthenet.com/world-war-two-german-pow- camps/.

Patton and commanded by Capt. Abraham Baum in late March 1945. *World War II commanding General Porky Waterford, who commissioned Craig W. Lowell in The Lieutenants, was modelled using character traits of George S. Patton. *In The Lieutenants, Lowell is evacuated from Greece in a British \\"Sutherland\\" \\"seaplane\\". Presumably this is meant to be a Sunderland flying boat.http://www.airvectors.net/avsund.html#m6. Retrieved July 28, 2018. The Short Sunderland was used during the Berlin Airlift to ferry salt to the city and landed on the Havel lakes, making Lowell's evacuation using one plausible. *In The Lieutenants, MacMillan, specifically in Chapter Four, Section Four (Mannheim, Germany 11 May 1946), is referred to by the rank of captain during his flight with Major General Porky Waterford en route to play a game of polo. However, after the polo game, during MacMillan's explanation to Waterford that Craig W. Lowell was a private and not an officer, MacMillan is referred to by the rank of lieutenant, and is done so until Chapter Four, Section Five (Bad Nauheim, Germany 12 May 1946). *In The Lieutenants, MacMillan in the spring of 1945 escapes via \\"neutral port\\" of Odessa, on the Black Sea, to Cairo, Egypt and subsequently to the US. However, Odessa was liberated by Soviet Army 3rd Ukrainian Front on April 10, 1944. In 1945, Odessa was under Soviet rule and thus couldn't be \\"neutral\\". *In The Captains, General MacArthur is mentioned as having received the Medal of Honor during the First World War. However, he did not receive it until 1942 at the direction of General George C. Marshall, for his leadership in the defense of the Philippines.Douglas MacArthur *In aviation communications, the number 9 is designated as \\"niner\\" to differentiate it from the number 5.

The building wasn't complete until the 1960s, so the meeting would have been at a building in Washington, D.C., instead. *In Special Ops the C-46 transport aircraft operated by \\"Air Simba\\" in the Congo is mentioned as a \\"Boeing C-46\\", actually, it was manufactured by Curtiss-Wright.http://www.aviation-history.com/curtiss/c46.htm *Also Special Ops makes reference to \\"T-18\\" engine test run-ups' keeping Jack awake. This should read \\"T-28.\\" (Obviously a simple typo.) *In Special Ops, at one point Craig Lowell, who was expelled from Harvard, asks Geoff Craig if the Harvard Alumni Association still sent him letters asking him to donate money to the college, to which Geoff replied, \\"Like clockwork, every month.\\" This is an error; in The Berets it was established that Geoff was drafted after his junior year at Princeton. Porter Craig sent Geoff to Princeton instead of Harvard, the family school, because he was convinced that the Harvard faculty was made up of Communists and progressives. Griffin's books frequently suffer from inconsistencies in character names and historical references. For example: ** In The Lieutenants, the Bellmons' daughter is referred to as \\"Eleanor\\", however, she is called \\"Marjorie\\" in the remaining books. **Similarly, in The Lieutenants, the Bellmon family owns a farm in Virginia, but in later books in the series the farm is described as being owned for generations by the Waterford family (Bellmon's in-laws). This may not be an inconsistency however, as it is assumed the Bellmon inherited the estate with the passing of his father-in-law, General Waterford. **While \\"Scotty\\" Laird (The Majors) is mentioned as the namesake of the airfield at Ft. Rucker following his crash at the controls of his H-13, a later book (Special Ops) makes reference to the same helicopter crash naming the real General Bogardus S. Cairns, after whom the Ft. Rucker airfield is named. Cairns died in an H-13 Sioux crash 9 December 1958. *There are several minor anachronisms in the books. For example, in The Majors, there is a reference to Xerox copiers (not available until 1959), and an Alabama ZIP code is used (though ZIP codes were not introduced by the postal service until 1963). *In this series of books, Griffin incorporates many of his own experiences from his service in the U.S. Army and captures some of the critical and little-known episodes in the evolution of new branches of arms, such as Special Forces and Airmobile Operations. In the afterword of The Aviators, he pays tribute to a long-time friend (Col. Clifford Merritt Walker, Jr.) whose exploits as a Huey pilot in Vietnam served as the inspiration for the events surrounding Capt. John Oliver's award of the Combat Infantryman's Badge. *The successful prison camp rescue mission is based on Operation Ivory Coast in which a rescue of American POWs was attempted at S∆°n T√¢y prison camp on 21 November 1970. The mission, while a tactical success, failed due to the prisoners' having been moved to another camp several months prior to the operation.https://sofrep.com/81923/remembering-bull-simons-true-legend- special-forces-community/.

It was one of 10 Florida Carnegie libraries to receive grants awarded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 1901 to 1917. Steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie provided funding for more than 3,000 Carnegie libraries in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The library is significant to the city's history as the first permanent home of the public library system and embodies the transformation of the city in the second decade of the twentieth century from a pioneer village to a city with viable cultural institutions. History In 1908, the St. Petersburg City Council and concerned citizens began on a journey to get funding for a public library. It was the culmination of a five-year pursuit by Councilman Ralph Veillard, W.L. Straub (owner of the St. Petersburg Times), and Annie McCrae, (who became the first secretary of the library) in 1913 that the city was awarded a $17,500 grant from the Carnegie Corporation. The grant was approved and matched by the city, and the site on the banks of the city Reservoir (now Mirror Lake) was chosen on July 17, 1914.\\"Finley, M.W. (2015, November 12)\\" The Mirror Lake Community Library is built in the Beaux-Arts style, with sculptural decoration along conservative modern lines, slightly overscaled details, bold sculptural supporting consoles, rich deep cornices, swags and sculptural enrichments. The Beaux- Arts style heavily influenced the architecture of the United States in the period from 1880 to 1920. The building's architect, Henry D. Whitfield worked for the Carnegie Corporation and designed this library, as well as many other Carnegie libraries in this style. Mirror Lake Library's first librarian was Miss Emma Moore Williams. Before becoming the Sunshine City's first librarian, she was the first English teacher at St. Petersburg's High School (St. Petersburg High School) and is described by the St. Petersburg Times as ‚Äúa very efficient and popular member of the city school faculty.‚Äù William's assistant librarian was Miss Margaret Jenkins, who ran the 4th Street Free Reading Room. William's first act as librarian was to catalog and shelve the 3,000 books brought over from the 4th street reading room. Mrs. Annie McRae [McCrae] was offered the position of librarian first, but declined due to ‚Äúpolitical concerns.‚Äù Mrs. McRae was the secretary of the library board and felt there was a conflict of interest in accepting the position. McCrae was a passionate advocate of obtaining a Carnegie library in St. Petersburg, and remained active in working on behalf of the library. She published articles in the St. Petersburg Times in support of the library. In one Times article, ‚ÄúWill St. Pete Finish Its Library Undertaking?‚Äù McCrae urged the city to use tax dollars to augment the former reading room's meager 3,000 books. The library was built to house 16,000 volumes. The mission of the library is three-fold, she stated, ‚ÄúIt is for information, for recreation, and for inspiration.‚Äù Of libraries, she urges, ‚ÄúWe cannot accurately trace its influence--it may kindle a train of thought that shall found museums and colleges and hospitals, that shall lead to the production of wonderful inventions that shall inspire noble deed of every kind.\\" The Junior League presented the city with their first bookmobile in February 1949.Fuller, W.P.

Mirror Lake Library Gets Approval for Restoration. St. Petersburg Times, pp. 3-D. The restoration was delayed by the discovery of unexpected structural damage and wrangling over the city budget; on January 18, 1994 then-mayor David Fischer cut the ribbon to reopen the refurbished 1915 wing of the library. The elevator was not yet installed at this point, and handicap access was still an issue because the ground floor entrance and the 1951 wing were closed.Williamson, E. (1994, January 10). Event to Mark Library‚Äôs Inner Renewal Series: Check It Out. St. Petersburg Times, pp. 3-D. In 1997, the project was completed and library was expanded with an 8,000 square-foot addition designed to blend harmoniously with the historic exterior and an elevator to make all levels handicap accessible.

Overselling is a common practice in the travel and hospitality sectors, in which it is expected that some people will cancel. The practice occurs as an intentional business strategy where sellers expect that some buyers will not consume all of the resources they are entitled to, or that some buyers will cancel. The practice of overselling aims to ensure that 100% of available supply will be used resulting in the maximum return on investment. However, if most customers do wish to purchase or use the sold commodity, it may leave some customers lacking a service they expected to receive. Overbooking is regulated (though rarely prohibited) in many countries and industries, and companies that do practice it are often required or forced by market competition to offer large amounts of compensation to customers as an incentive for them to not take up their purchase. An alternative to overbooking is discouraging consumers from buying services they do not actually intend to use. This can be done by making reservations non- refundable, a common practice among low-cost carriers and railways, or requiring customers wishing to cancel their right to a service to pay a termination fee.  Transportation  An airline, rail or shipping company can book more customers onto a vehicle than can actually be accommodated by an aircraft, train or cruise ship. This allows them to have a (nearly) full vehicle on most runs, even if some customers miss the trip or don't show up (tickets are often rebookable afterwards). Business travellers often cancel at the last minute, when their meetings take more time than planned. If everyone shows up, at least in the case of airlines, the overbooking will cause an oversale. Airlines Airlines may ask for volunteers to give away their seats or refuse boarding to certain passengers in exchange for a compensation that may include an additional free ticket and/or an upgrade in a later flight. They can do this and still make more money than if they booked only to the plane's capacity and had it take off with empty seats. In the past some airlines, like JetBlue Airways, did not overbook as a policy that provides incentive and avoids customer disappointment. They were able to do this and remain profitable as the majority of their customers are tourists, instead of business fliers, and their tickets are non-refundable, thereby lowering the chances of passengers missing their flights. However, since 2017 JetBlue again began overbooking flights.https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation- consumer-protection/july-2018-air-travel-consumer-report A few airline frequent flyer programs actually allow a customer the privilege of flying an already overbooked flight; another customer will be asked to leave. Often, only economy class is overbooked while higher classes are not, allowing the airline to upgrade some passengers to otherwise unused seats while providing assurance to higher paying customers. In the EU, airlines are required to appeal for passengers to voluntarily release their seat, maybe by giving an offer of compensation. If necessary, airlines may then refuse passengers the right to board, in which case Regulation 261/2004 sets out compensation requirements for airlines that deny boarding to passengers due to overbooking. Specific cases In 2007, Air Deccan, the Indian low-cost airline was found by Directorate General of Civil Aviation to overbook even when they weren't permitted to do so. They were accused of cheating passengers by tagging the confirmed tickets as no show for compensating the additional seats. The airline pocketed all the money made by overbooking, minus airport tax, without offering a later flight for overbooked customers. The passengers that arrive last, either on time or even a minute late, become the target.Air Deccan accused of over-booking by a TV news channel In 2011, Delta Air Lines began a practice in which they overbook some flights, using algorithms to determine how many seats to overbook based on historical data, and allow passengers checking in for the overbooked flight to state the value of travel vouchers they would be willing to accept in exchange for taking a later flight. The airline then selects the passengers who will be bumped to a later flight based on the lowest bids. According to the airline, the biggest cost savings from the practice is that it improves on-time flight departures, since gate attendants are not burdened with negotiating with passengers that are considering being bumped from the flight. Among the three major U.S. carriers, Delta had the highest rate of total bumped passengers (96 per 100,000 passengers vs. 95 on United Airlines and 50 on American Airlines), but the lowest rate of involuntarily bumped passengers (3 per 100,000 vs. 5 on American and 11 on United). In early April 2017, severe weather on the East Coast of the United States caused many flight cancellations, with Delta having more 3,200 cancellations in a five-day period. Due to the large number of stranded passengers trying to board flights, many were far overbooked, resulting in Delta paying out unusually high-priced vouchers, with one group of three passengers being paid over $11,000 over a weekend of delays as a result of the overbooking. Involuntary deboarding The next Sunday, April 9, 2017, continued problems from overbooking received media coverage when a man was forcibly removed by law enforcement officers from an overbooked United Airlines flight. After the plane fully boarded, according to reports, the airline asked for four passengers to volunteer their seats in exchange for $800 vouchers so four United crew members could board. After no passengers on the flight voluntarily stepped forward, the airline announced that they would select four passengers at random to be removed from the overbooked flight. One of the men selected to be removed refused, telling the United crew member that he was a doctor that needed to see patients the following morning, prompting the airline to call security. As seen in videos filmed by other passengers, the man was forcefully pulled from his seat, knocked unconscious and had his bloodied, limp body dragged down the aisle to the exit. On April 11, United said that Flight 3411 was not overbooked, but rather sold out - contrary to their earlier statement. Aircraft manufacturers Both Airbus and Boeing are known to overbook their backlog of aircraft orders, and both use internal algorithms to estimate how many airlines will defer or cancel their aircraft orders, so as to maintain a steady production rate. Rail Rail networks often do not overbook reserved seats. With many networks, including the UK and French systems, a contrast is offered between advance-purchase tickets, which do guarantee a (specific) seat and are therefore often non-refundable, and \\"walk-on\\" tickets purchased on the day of travel, which do not; these passengers may be forced to stand or take a tip-up seat in a vestibule. Rail networks face less pressure in this than airlines, which cannot allow passengers to stand. Rail networks accordingly often do not have a centralised booking system; as passengers can stand, tickets can be sold from automated machines and clerks with no knowledge of how many people intend to board a train. In addition, rail networks have to deal with the unpredictable nature of season ticket holders, who have purchased a right to make unlimited use of a route; these passengers may often be allowed to join any train but not guaranteed a seat. In some situations over-booking is actively encouraged by rail companies in order to inflate sales and therefore the importance/prominence of a particular line in government statistics. For example, a single journey from the Glasgow neighbourhood of Queen's Park, to Glasgow Central station in the city centre is ¬£2.10 while an off-peak return is ¬£1.90. Ticket staff will therefore routinely issue return tickets even when passengers state they do not intend to return that day. As another example, advance-fare tickets from Aberdeen to or from Glasgow and Edinburgh can be purchased for as little as ¬£5 while a walk-on ticket can be as much as ¬£90. There are 16 services a day meaning it is ¬£10 cheaper for a firm to buy an advance-purchase ticket, with an assigned seat, on every service than to buy a single walk-on service at the point it is required. This tactic is often employed by firms in the oil and gas industry and subsequently trains to/from Aberdeen often have many assigned seats which are not claimed initially, resulting in standing passengers occupying them as soon as the train leaves and it is established they are in fact empty. Telecommunications Telephone networks A telephone company can experience problems when large numbers of callers attempt to use the system at the same time. This generally only happens in exceptional circumstances such as a disaster or national emergency, but can result in some calls not going through at all. The United States has the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service and Nationwide Wireless Priority Service, and the United Kingdom(UK) has the Government Telephone Preference Scheme and ACCOLC to allow official calls to go through reliably in emergencies. Building for typical rather than peak demand is considerably less expensive. Communications access networks (last-mile) In a communications system in which multiple users share a common resource, oversubscription refers to the ratio of the allocated bandwidth per user to the guaranteed bandwidth per user. Underlying the oversubscription model is the fact that statistically few users will attempt to utilize their allocated bandwidth simultaneously. Calculation and management of oversubscription ratios is common in the CATV industry.Victor Blake,Chasing Verizon FiOS,, Accessed 10/3/2009More on DOCSIS,, Accessed 10/3/2009Cisco,Appendix A: DOCSIS and CMTS Architectural Overview,, Accessed 10/3/2009 In a cable network utilizing DOCSIS 1.1, for example, the full 38 Mbit/s download bandwidth CableLabs, Radio Frequency Interface Specification,, Accessed 10/3/2009 is typically shared by some 500 subscribers,Mountain Cablevision, Deploying Commercial Services, Tools and Techniques,10/21/2008, , Accessed 10/2/2009 each of which may be allocated 7 Mbit/s.Mountain Cable Internet Offerings, , Accessed 10/3/2009 Calculating the guaranteed bandwidth per subscriber in this case is accomplished by dividing the maximum total bandwidth of 38 Mbit/s by 500, the maximum number of simultaneous users. The advertised peak bandwidth per user of 7 Mbit/s is 92 times the guaranteed bandwidth per user of 0.076 Mbit/s. In this example, the download oversubscription ratio is 92:1. A similar calculation can be performed using upstream bandwidths. Typically, advertised upload rates are 1/4 the download rates Comcast High Speed Data Products \\"\\", Accessed 10/3/2009 however the available upload bandwidth using DOCSIS 1.1 or 2.0 is also lower. If 100 users allocated 1.75 Mbit/s of upload bandwidth share a single DOCSIS 1.1 upstream, the upload oversubscription ratio is 17:1. One article found a typical DOCSIS download oversubscription ratio to be 28.125:1, while a best case oversubscription may be 12:1. Oversubscription is not the same as overselling, provided that the oversubscription ratio, for a given number of subscribers traffic, which is multiplexed over time, does not significantly impact performance. A significant impact to performance might be one in which the performance of the oversubscribed portion of the network is less than that of the end to end service that the subscriber is using. In other words, oversubscription works because not everyone uses it at the same time. Oversubscription is the basis for all non-dedicated telecommunications services. Even if a subscriber had a dedicated access network, that network is still oversubscribed against many others with respect to Internet access for example. The same is true in telephony and in wireless. It is not economically practical, environmentally reasonable, or technically feasible to provide dedicated access for every service to every customer. A well-engineered oversubscribed service appears to function as a dedicated service to a subscriber. Another way of saying this is that a good engineer designs the oversubscription in a way that makes the service appear to be a dedicated service for that customer. That means no dropped calls on your cell phone, no busy signals when dialing, and no failed downloads on the Internet (for example). G-PON and XG-PON access networks are typically oversubscribed, with typical load-factors of approaching 256:1, due its point-to-multipoint architecture. Internet ISPs regularly sell more bandwidth or connectivity than they have. When Internet bandwidth becomes overused, all customers' service tends to be degraded without necessarily failing completely. Web hosting In the web hosting industry, the term is used to describe a situation in which a company provides hosting plans that are unsustainable if every one of its customers uses the full extent of services advertised. The term is usually referred to the web space and bandwidth transfer allowance. A hosting company may offer unlimited space and unlimited bandwidth, however, they put other restrictions in place such as CPU usage or inode limit. They may have onerous restrictions and one-sided contracts that lets them cancel the hosting of anybody that puts a strain on their system or fully uses their claimed allotments. This practice usually incurs little ill- effect since most customers do not use any significant portion of their allocated share. If a customer has a small, low-traffic site serving static HTML pages, few resources will be used. If a customer wishes to run a high- traffic, professional, or business website an oversold hosting account can be detrimental. In these cases, a shared hosting provider that does not oversell, a virtual private server or dedicated server is a preferred option.  Hotels  During times of high demand, hotel operations also practice overbooking and apply similar procedures to that of the airline industry in which an equal or greater service of that of which was booked must be provided to the customer, in the case of a hotel, most states have laws requiring accommodations to be provided at an alternate hotel referred to as a \\"walk\\" in hotel terminology. In the event that a hotel is overbooked resulting in no rooms remaining available, hotel management will often \\"walk\\" the customer to a neighboring hotel at an equal or complementary rate depending on the situation, hotels often maintain partnerships or agreements with neighboring or competitor hotels to utilize as alternate arrangements for overbooked customers during walk situations. Some hotel chains have specific company policies which determine which customers will be walked in order of priority, often customers who belong to the highest tier level of the hotel's loyalty program or are considered a VIP guest will likely not be walked or would be the last to be walked in an extreme situation. Customers with third-party reservations that were not made directly with the hotel or first time customers with a discounted rate may be at a higher risk of being walked.  Solutions  In the transportation area a company can increase the number of flights on routes, add more cars or consists to a train, move to a larger ship or add ships or containers to a cargo transport. In the telecommunications industry a common carrier may be able to solve an overbooking problem by adding bandwidth‚Äîeither by adding lines to an existing system, reconfiguring existing lines, upgrading existing lines to a higher speed line or greater number of time-multiplexed lines, or some other scheme to add bandwidth. In the hotel industry, while revenue management teams commonly practice overbooking, they also work to ensure that hotels are not excessively overbooked resulting in negative brand perception and loss in profit.

CC also has its annual Boys Bowl mass, breakfast, and Athletic Hall of Fame induction ceremony that weekend as well, which is hosted by the CC Alumni Association Committees. History Boys' Bowl began October 22, 1944. Alex Chesney coached the Shamrocks that year, and CC was considered the best football team in the state. Father James Martin, CSB, Athletic Director of CC at that time, came up with an idea of having the best team in Michigan play against the best team in America, Boys Town, Nebraska, and met with Edward J. Flanagan of Boys' Town. The game was played at Briggs Stadium. Boys Town, whose coach had gone undefeated for an indefinite amount of time, came in wearing blue. CC donned, contrary to the usual royal blue and white, jerseys of blue and gold. That game resulted in a tie between the two teams, but it started a long-standing tradition which would last from that time to the present day Boys Bowl. Due to rising costs of moving a team across the country, the games soon ended, but have now since been replaced with CC games against De La Salle Collegiate High School, Brother Rice High School, U of D Jesuit (2011) and many other Catholic schools under the archdiocese of Detroit. It continues to be one of Michigan's most anticipated and highest attended high school athletic events every year. Boys' Bowl Posters Traditionally, Juniors and Seniors in Catholic Central paint large banner posters to be hung over the walls and ceiling, usually containing \\"Go Shamrocks!\\" banners or inside jokes about the school. Banners are also painted for the Catholic Central - Brother Rice game. Catholic Central leads the all- time series 34-30-1 as of 2020.

An epikleros (; plural epikleroi) was an heiress in ancient Athens and other ancient Greek city states, specifically a daughter of a man who had no male heirs. In Sparta, they were called patrouchoi (), as they were in Gortyn. Athenian women were not allowed to hold property in their own name; in order to keep her father's property in the family, an epikleros was required to marry her father's nearest male relative. Even if a woman was already married, evidence suggests that she was required to divorce her spouse to marry that relative. Spartan women were allowed to hold property in their own right, and so Spartan heiresses were subject to less restrictive rules. Evidence from other city- states is more fragmentary, mainly coming from the city-states of Gortyn and Rhegium. Plato wrote about epikleroi in his Laws, offering idealized laws to govern their marriages. In mythology and history, a number of Greek women appear to have been epikleroi, including Agariste of Sicyon and Agiatis, the widow of the Spartan king Agis IV. The status of epikleroi has often been used to explain the numbers of sons-in-law who inherited from their fathers-in-law in Greek mythology. The Third Sacred War originated in a dispute over epikleroi. Etymology The term epikleros (a feminine adjective acting as noun; from the proverb ·Ω≤œÄŒØ, ep√≠, \\"on, upon\\", and the noun Œ∫Œª·øÜœÅŒøœÇ, klƒìros, \\"lot, estate\\") was used in Ancient Greece to describe the daughter of a man who had died leaving no male heir. It translates to \\"attached to the family property\\",Grant The Rise of the Greeks p. 31 or \\"upon, with the estate\\". In most ancient Greek city states, women could not own property, and so a system was devised to keep ownership within the male-defined family line. Epikleroi' were required to marry the nearest relative on their father's side of the family, a system of inheritance known as the epiklerate.Pomeroy Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves pp. 60‚Äì62 Although epikleros is often mistranslated as \\"heiress\\",Cantarella \\"Gender, Sexuality, and Law\\" Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law pp. 248‚Äì249 strictly speaking the terms are not equivalent, as the woman never owned the property and so was unable to dispose of it.Lacey The Family in Ancient Greece p. 24 Raphael Sealey argues that another translation could be \\"female orphan\\".Sealey Justice of the Greeks p. 17 The term was used interchangeably, both of the woman herself, and of the property that was the inherited estate.Gould \\"Law, Custom and Myth\\" Journal of Hellenic Studies p. 43 footnote 36 The entire system of the epiklerate was unique to Ancient Greece, and mainly an Athenian institution. Athens Athens is the city-state that is best documented, both in terms of epikleroi and in all aspects of legal history. Athenian law on epikleroi was attributed to Solon; women with no brothers had to marry their nearest male relative on their paternal side of the family, starting with their father's brother and moving from there to the next nearest male relative on the paternal side.Grant The Rise of the Greeks p. 49 The historian John Gould notes that the order of relatives that were required to marry the epikleros coincided with the relatives required to avenge a murder. This set of relatives was known as the anchisteia () in Athens.Gould \\"Law, Custom and Myth\\" Journal of Hellenic Studies pp. 43‚Äì44Schaps Economic Rights pp. 25‚Äì26 The anchisteia was also the group of relatives who would inherit property in the absence of legal heirs.Just Women in Athenian Law and Life p. 85 If there was more than one possible spouse in a set of relatives, the right to marry the epikleros went to the eldest one. The property that was inherited could also be in debt, which would not affect the epikleros' status. Definition of the term in Athens Although epikleros was most often used in the case of a daughter who had no living brothers when her father died, the term was also used for other cases. The Suda, a 10th-century CE lexicon and encyclopedia,Browning \\"Suda\\" Oxford Classical Dictionary gives other definitions, including an heiress who was married at the time of her father's death and an unmarried daughter without brothers still living with her father. The Suda also stated that the term could be used of a daughter who had living sisters. Although the Suda indicates that in normal usage, the mother of the heiress was also dead, this is incorrect: whether or not the mother was alive had no bearing on the status of the epikleros. Occasionally the term is also used as a feminine form of the Greek term orphanos, or \\"orphan\\". Although a scholiast of Aeschines, or a later writer amending the text, stated that the term could also be used of a daughter who was given to a man in marriage on her father's deathbed, there is no extant use of the term in that sense in literature, and the scholiast has probably misunderstood a scenario from the comic playwright Aristophanes. The term in Athens seems to have always been somewhat loosely used in legal proceedings. Apollodorus, an Athenian politician and litigant from the 4th century BCE,Trevett \\"Apollodorus\\" Oxford Classical Dictionary in one of his speeches attempted to use an Athenian law about betrothal to make his mother an epikleros. He claimed that the law defined an epikleros as a female without father, a brother who shared a father with her, or a paternal grandfather. His opponent, however, seems to have disputed this interpretation of the law. A speech by Isaeus, a 4th-century BCE speechwriter,Davies \\"Isaeus\\" Oxford Classical Dictionary rests on the claim that the speaker's mother only became an epikleros after her young brother died following their father's death. Whether the legal authorities recognized the speaker's claim as valid is unknown. It appears, at least according to some plays, that a woman with a brother who died after their father was considered the epikleros of her brother, not her father.Macdowell \\"Love versus the Law\\" Greece & Rome p. 48 Development of the practice It is unclear if there were laws dealing with epikleroi prior to Solon's legislative activity around 594 BCE. According to the 1st century CE writer Plutarch, Solon authored legislation covering the epikleros. Solon's laws attempted to prevent the combination of estates by the marriage of heiresses.Lacey The Family in Classical Greece p. 89 Modern historians have seen this as part of an effort by Solon to maintain a stable number of households.Lape \\"Solon\\" Classical Journal p. 133 According to Plutarch, Solon also legislated that the husband of an epikleros must have sexual intercourse with her at least three times a month in order to provide her with children to inherit her father's property, but by the time of Pericles (d. 429 BCE) this law is definitely attested.Schaps \\"What was Free?\\" Transactions of the American Philogical Association pp. 165‚Äì166 It is unclear whether or not the nearest relative had the power to dissolve an epikleros' previous marriage in order to marry her himself in all cases.Lacey The Family in Ancient Greece pp. 139‚Äì145Carey \\"Apollodoros' Mother\\" Classical Quarterly p. 88 The historian Sarah Pomeroy states that most scholars lean towards the opinion that the nearest relative could only dissolve the previous marriage if the heiress had not yet given birth to a son, but Pomeroy also states that this opinion has not yet been definitely proven. Roger Just disagrees and has argued that even if the epikleros had a son she could still be forced to marry her nearest relative.Ormand \\"Marriage, Identity, and the Tale of Mestra\\" American Journal of Philology pp. 332‚Äì333 footnote 84 Athenian law also required that if the next of kin did not marry the heiress, he had to provide her with a dowry. It may have been Solon who legislated that if the new spouse was unable to fulfill his thrice monthly duties to his wife, she was entitled to have sex with his next of kin so that she could produce an heir to her father's property. Alternatively, she might have been required to divorce and marry the next nearest relative.Carey \\"The Shape of Athenian Laws\\" Classical Quarterly p. 104 Legal procedures When a man died leaving an epikleros, the heiress was felt to be epidikos, or as it literally translates, \\"adjudicable\\". This made her available for the specialized procedure for the betrothal of an epikleros, a type of court judgement called epidikasia.Lacey The Family in Classical Greece p. 106 The proceedings took place in the archon's court, for citizen epikleroi. For the epikleroi of resident aliens in Athens, the metics, the polemarch was in charge of their affairs.Schaps Economic Rights pp. 33‚Äì35 It was also the case that if a man made a will, but did not give any of his daughters their legal rights as epikleroi in the will, then that will was held to be invalid.Lacey The Family in Classical Greece p. 131 A young Athenian male, prior to coming of age and serving his time as an ephebe, or military trainee, was allowed to claim epikleroi, the only legal right an ephebe was permitted in Aristotle's day, besides that of taking office as a priest in an hereditary priesthood.Patterson Family in Greek History p. 97 It is also unclear if a man who was eligible to marry an epikleros but was already married could keep his previous wife while also claiming the epikleros. While all evidence points to the ancient Athenians being monogamous, there are two speeches by Demosthenes implying that men did indeed have both a wife acquired through the normal betrothal procedure and another who was adjudicated to them through the epidikasia () procedure. The archon was also responsible for overseeing the treatment of epikleroi, along with widows, orphans, widows who claimed to be pregnant and households that were empty.Roy \\"Polis and Oikos in Classical Greece\\" Greece & Rome pp. 11‚Äì12 When sons of an epikleros came of age, they gained the ownership of the inheritance.Hodkinson \\"Land Tenure and Inheritance in Classical Sparta\\" Classical Quarterly p. 395 In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years past the age of puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required.Ashari \\"Laws of Inheritance\\" Historia: Zeitschrift pp. 16‚Äì17 By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property. Although the law did not rule on who exactly owned the property before the son took possession, it appears from other sources that it was not actually owned by the husband of the epikleros, in contrast to the usual procedure in Athens where the husband owned any property of the wife and could do with it as he willed. A number of speeches imply that the property was considered to be owned by the epikleros herself, although she had little ability to dispose of it. The husband probably had day to day control of the property and administered it, but was responsible for the management to the epikleros' heirs when they came of age. The position of the husband of an epikleros was closest to that of an epitropos, or the guardian of an orphan's property, who was likewise responsible to the orphan for his care of the property when the orphan came of age. Another parallel with the orphan was that an epikleros' property was exempt from liturgies (leitourgia), or the practice of requiring citizens to perform public tasks without compensation,Henrichs, et al \\"Liturgy\\" Oxford Classical Dictionary as was the orphan's.Schaps Economic Rights pp. 26‚Äì28 It may have been possible for the husband of an epikleros to allow the posthumous adoption of the son of an epikleros as the son of the epikleros' father. This would prevent the inheritance of the newly adopted son of any property from his natural father, but it had the advantage of preserving the adoptee's oikos, commonly translated as \\"household\\" but incorporating ideas of kinship and property also.Foxhall \\"Household, Greek\\" Oxford Classical Dictionary Although the preservation of the paternal oikos is usually felt to be the reason behind the whole practice of the epiklerate, the historian David Schaps argues that in fact, this was not really the point of the practice. Instead, he argues, that it was the practice of adoption that allowed the preservation of an oikos.Schaps Economic Rights pp. 32‚Äì33 Schaps feels that the reason the epiklerate evolved was to ensure that orphaned daughters were married.Schaps Economic Rights pp. 41‚Äì42 Other historians, including Sarah Pomeroy, feel that the children of an epikleros were considered to transmit the paternal grandfather's oikos.Pomeroy Families in Classical and Hellenistic Greece p. 25 The historian Cynthia Patterson agrees, arguing that adoption may have seemed unnecessary, especially if the epikleros and her husband gave their son the name of the maternal grandfather. She argues that too much attention has been paid to the patrilineal aspects of the oikos, and that there was probably less emphasis on this in actual Athenian practice and more on keeping a household together as a productive unit.Patterson Family in Greek History pp. 99‚Äì101 The historian Roger Just states the main principle of the epiklerate was that no man could become the guardian of the property without also becoming the husband of the epikleros. Just uses this principle to claim that any man adopted by the father of an epikleros was required to marry the epikleros. Just states that the forcible divorce and remarriage of an epikleros was based on this principle, arguing that if the father of the epikleros had not adopted the first husband, the husband was not really the heir. Just sees the development of the epiklerate as flowing from Solon's desire to keep the number of Athenian households constant. According to Just, before Solon's legislation, the epikleros was just treated as part of the property, but that Solon's reforms transformed the epikleros into a transmitter of the property and her son the automatic heir to her father's estate.Just Women in Athenian Law and Life pp. 95‚Äì98 Taking as a wife an epikleros who had little estate was considered a praiseworthy action, and was generally stressed in public speeches. Such an heiress was called an epikleros thessa.Pomeroy Families in Classical and Hellenistic Greece p. 37 If the nearest male relative did not wish to marry an epikleros who belonged to the lowest income class in Athens, he was required to find her a husband and provide her with a dowry on a graduated scale according to his own income class. This dowry was in addition to her own property and the requirement was designed to ensure that even poor heiresses found husbands.Macdowell \\"Love versus the Law\\" Greece & Rome p. 49 The law also did not stipulate what was to happen if the epikleros was still an infant or too young for consummation of the marriage when she was claimed.Scafuro Forensic Stage p. 288 Sequence of the anchisteia The first set of relatives that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters of the father and any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal uncles, and following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of the father. After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of the father and then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father.Patterson Family in Greek History p. 98 It appears that if there were two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.Macdowell \\"Love versus the Law\\" Greece & Rome p. 47 Chances of becoming an epikleros Modern estimates of the odds of an Athenian woman becoming an epikleros say that roughly one out of seven fathers died without biological sons.Golden \\"Donatus and Athenian Phratries\\" Classical Quarterly p. 10 However, Athenian law allowed for a man to adopt another male as a son in his will, so not all daughters without brothers would have become epikleroi.Roy \\"Polis and Oikos in Classical Athens\\" Greece & Rome p. 12 Most modern historians estimate that 20% of families would have had only daughters, and another 20% would have been childless.Patterson Family in Greek History p. 93 The modern historian Cynthia Patterson said of the epikleros that although \\"she was distinctive, she was not rare\\". Already married epikleroi Whether an epikleros who was married at the time of her father's death was required to divorce her current spouse and marry the anchisteia is unclear. Most modern historians have come to the conclusion that this was only required if the epikleros had not yet had a son that could inherit the grandfather's estate. The clearest evidence is from the Roman playwright Terence, in his play Adelphoe, which includes a plot element involving a claim that a girl is actually an epikleros. Although the play was written in the 2nd century BCE, Terence adapted most of his plays from earlier Athenian comedies, which makes it slightly more reliable as a source. And common sense argues that if a son had already been born to an epikleros, there was no need to parcel out the epikleros to a relative in order to provide a male heir to the grandfather's estate. Although the anchisteia had the right to marry the epikleros, he was not required to do so, and could refuse the match or find another spouse for the heiress. It was also possible for the husband of an epikleros, who was not her anchisteia, to buy off the anchisteia in order to remain married to his wife. Such cases were alleged by the speaker of Isaeus' speech Isaeus 10 as well as a character in Menander's play Aspis.Schaps Economic Rights pp. 28‚Äì31 Other city-states Evidence for other ancient city states is more scattered and fragmentary. Sparta In ancient Sparta, women had extensive rights, including the right to inherit property and to manage their own and their spouse's property.Grant The Rise of the Greeks p. 98Cartledge \\"Spartan Wives\\" Classical Quarterly pp. 97‚Äì99 The comparable term to epikleros in Sparta was patrouchoi, occasionally rendered as patrouchos.Patterson Family in Greek History p. 92 In Sparta the law of epikleros only applied to unmarried girls, and the Spartan kings were responsible for finding spouses for epikleroi who had not been betrothed before their father's death.Lacey The Family in Classical Greece pp. 202‚Äì203 Herodotus, in his list of Spartan royal prerogatives, said: \\"The kings are the sole judges of these cases only: concerning an unmarried heiress, to whom it pertains to have [her], if her father has not bethrothed her\\",Quoted in Hodkinson \\"Land Tenure and Inheritance in Classical Sparta\\" Classical Quarterly p. 394 but the exact meaning of this statement is debated. Some historians have interpreted this to mean that the kings had the right to give the heiress to anyone they chose, but others have suggested that the kings merely had the right to bestow the heiress on the nearest male relative, or to arbitrate between competing claims.Hodkinson \\"Land Tenure and Inheritance in Classical Sparta\\" Classical Quarterly pp. 394‚Äì396 Another suggestion is that the king's choice was restricted to citizens who had no land.Ashari \\"Laws of Inheritance\\" Historia: Zeitschrift p. 18 The name given to these heiresses in Sparta was patroiouchoi, which literally translates as \\"holders of the patrimony.\\" They inherited the land themselves, and retained the right to dispose of their inherited property. There were no restrictions on who they might marry.Cartledge The Spartans p. 169 By the 4th century BCE Aristotle records that there were no restrictions on whom an heiress might marry. If she was not married during her father's lifetime or by directions in her father's will, her nearest next-of-kin was allowed to marry her wherever he chose.Ashari \\"Laws of Inheritance\\" Historia: Zeitschrift p. 19 Gortyn In Gortyn, epikleroi were also called patroiokos, and they were more generously treated than in Athens.Pomeroy Families in Classical and Hellenistic Greece p. 53 footnote 87 The term patroiokos can be literally translated as \\"having the father's property\\", and was a description of the condition of the heiress. She was considered a patroiouchoi if she had no father or brother by her father living. The relative who had the right to marry her was called an epiballon, and the list of who were eligible for that status was also limited to just her paternal uncles and the sons of those uncles. If there were no candidates fitting those conditions, the patroiouchoi was free to marry as she chose. If she wished, a patroiouchos could free herself from the obligation to marry her nearest relative by paying him part of her inheritance. If her nearest relative did not wish to marry her, she was free to find a spouse in her tribe, or if none was willing, then she could marry whomever she wished.Grant The Rise of the Greeks p. 199Lacey The Family in Classical Greece pp. 212‚Äì213 Gortyn may owe the liberality of its heiress laws to the fact that it was one of the few city-states known to have allowed daughters to inherit even if they had brothers; daughters in Gortyn received half the share of a son.Schaps \\"Women in Greek Inheritance Law\\" Classical Quarterly p. 55 To prevent the abuse of the system, there was a time limit on the right of the closest epiballon to marry her, and if the limit expired, the right passed to the next nearest epiballon until the patroiouchoi was either married or ran out of possible epiballontes. There was a limit, however, that a man could only marry one heiress. Unlike in Athens, the heiress owned her inheritance and her son did not inherit until she died. Her son was also eligible to inherit from his father. Others Rhegium owed its laws on epikleroi to Androdamas of Rhegium, a law-giver whose views on this subject were especially esteemed, according to Aristotle.Grant The Rise of the Greeks p. 260 In the city-state of Charondas' laws, an epikleros had to be given a dowry if her nearest kin did not wish to marry her.Lacey The Family in Classical Greece p. 225 During the time of Alexander the Great, Tegean law deals with the inheritance of returning exiles, limiting them to inheriting only their paternal estate or an estate of their mother if she had become an epikleros while in exile. The city-states of Naupactus and Thermus allowed women to inherit property, but whether or not the daughters were considered epikleroi is unknown from the surviving fragments of the laws from those cities.Schaps Economic Rights pp. 42‚Äì47 Plato Plato, in his Laws, set forth rules that governed not the ideal state, which he described in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with the daughter of a man who died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, and said that the inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.Schaps \\"Women in Greek Inheritance Law\\" Classical Quarterly p. 56 Later history In 318 BCE, Cassander appointed Demetrius Phalereus to govern the city-state of Athens. Demetrius issued a set of laws that are known from later literary works. Although knowledge of these laws is fragmentary, it does not appear that Demetrius legislated anything on the subject of epikleroi. This is in striking contrast to Solon's legislation, which was concerned with the internal affairs of the family and its external manifestations in public life.Patterson Family in Greek History pp. 188‚Äì191 By the 4th century BCE, the practice of the epiklerate was falling into disuse, and it disappeared during the Hellenistic Period, although it continued to appear in New Comedy and scattered inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, if dated correctly, refer to occasional epikleroi.Scafuro Forensic Stage pp. 281‚Äì282 and footnote 2 One method that developed to avoid the epiklerate was through the adoption of a son by the father of a possible epikleros.Sealey Justice of the Greeks p. 18 Noted epikleroi In mythology In the tales of heroic Greece, royal succession often passed from father-in-law to son-in-law, and some historians have seen in this an early example of the epikleros pattern. Some examples include Pelops, Bellerophon, Melampus, Peleus, Telamon, and Diomedes. Not all such heroic era royal successions followed the epikleros pattern however, as in the case of Menelaus, who married Helen of Troy and succeeded Helen's father Tyndareus, even though Tyndareus had living sons, Kastor and Polydeukes.Finkelberg \\"Royal Succession in Heroic Greece\\" Classical Quarterly p. 305 Another example is Arete of Phaeacia in the Odyssey, who was an heiress married to her father's brother Alcinous.Patterson Family in Greek History p. 91 Historical examples Aristotle related that the revolt of Mytilene against Athens in 428 BCE originated in a dispute over epikleroi. The Sacred War of 356‚Äì346 BCE, between Thebes and Phocis, was also started by a disagreement over epikleroi.Lacey The Family in Classical Greece pp. 229‚Äì230 It is likely that Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes of Sicyon who married Megacles of Athens, was an epikleros.Lacey The Family in Classical Greece p. 276 note 29 Likewise, the widow of the Spartan king Agis IV, Agiatis, was forced to marry Cleomenes, the son of the man who had executed Agis, King Leonidas II. Plutarch stated that the reason Leonidas married Agiatis to Kleomenes was that Agiatis was a patrouchos from her father, Gylippos.Hodkinson \\"Land Tenure and Inheritance in Classical Sparta\\" Classical Quarterly p. 398 Another Spartan example may have been Gorgo, the only daughter of King Cleomenes I, who was married to Cleomenes' brother Leonidas I. Kallisto, the granddaughter of the Athenian orator Lykourgos was an epikleros after the deaths of her grandfather, paternal uncles Habron and Lykourgos, and father Lykophron. She was married and had a son, whom her father adopted and renamed Lykophron. After her father's adoption of her son, Kallisto's husband, son and father all died, leaving her father's household in danger of extinction. Her second marriage, however, produced a son who continued the household.Blok and Lambert \\"Appointment of Priests\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik pp. 102‚Äì103 Demosthenes' mother Cleoboule was the epikleros of Gylon.Hunter \\"Policing Public Debtors\\" Phoenix p. 30 Other possible epikleroi include the daughters of Polyeuctus, who managed to remain married to their spouses even after becoming epikleroi. Meidylides' daughter was an heiress, and her father tried to marry her to her anchisteia, but the prospective husband refused the match and the daughter was married to a non-relative instead. Literary examples In literature, Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus, would be considered an epikleros, and her uncle Creon would have been responsible for her marriage as well as that of her sister Ismene.Patterson Family in Greek History p. 113 The marriage of an epikleros also is part of the plot for Menander's play Aspis.Brown \\"Menander's Dramatic Technique\\" Classical Quarterly p. 413 In Euripides' play Ion, Erechtheus's daughter Creusa is an epikleros whose status allows her son Ion to become a citizen of Athens.Hoffer \\"Violence, Culture, and the Workings of Ideology\\" Classical Antiquity p. 304 Alexis, Antiphanes, Diodorus, Diphilus, Euetes, and Heniokhos all wrote comedies titled Epikleros, although none are extant.Scafuro Forensic Stage p. 293 and footnote 33 Three more comedies were titled Epidikazmenos, or \\"the man to whom an estate is adjudged\\" - these were by Diphilus, Philemon and Apollodorus of Carystus.Scafuro Forensic Stage p. 293 and footnote 32 Two Latin comedies survive which were based on Greek plays dealing with heiresses: the Phormio, which is based on Apollodorus' Epidikazmenos; and the Adelphoe, which is based on Menander's play Adelphoi.Scafuro Forensic Stage p. 294 A speech of Andocides indirectly concerns epikleroi, as the orator claimed that the real origin of the dispute between himself and his cousin Leagros was over which of them would claim an heiress that both were related to.Scafuro Forensic Stage pp. 69‚Äì71 Demosthenes' speech Against Macartatus includes a description of Sositheos' claiming of the epikleros Phulomakhe.Scafuro Forensic Stage pp. 285‚Äì286 See also *Endogamy *Exogamy Notes Citations References                   External links *A Glossary of Athenian Legal Terms ‚Äì hosted by the Stoa Consortium at the University of Kentucky *Women and Family in Athenian Law ‚Äì hosted by the Stoa Consortium at the University of Kentucky *Women and Property in Ancient Athens ‚Äì by James C.

History The vehicle of Bonnie and Clyde is shown riddled with bullet holes after the ambush. The picture was taken by FBI investigators on May 23, 1934 Hinton, then twenty-nine, was assigned to accompany Deputy Sheriff Bob Alcorn on the premise that Hinton knew Clyde Barrow and could identify him. Hinton and Alcorn were assigned by Dallas County Sheriff Richard A. \\"Smoot\\" Schmid to assist Frank Hamer and his assistant Maney Gault in a shoot-to-kill order against Bonnie and Clyde that originated with the Texas prison system chief Lee Simmons. Hinton became a Sheriff's Deputy in 1932 following the election of Schmid. An avid baseball player, Hinton passed up a chance to join the Cleveland Indians because he did not want to spend time away from his wife and young son. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and reared in Dallas, he knew the Barrow family in his youth. Ted Hinton was also once acquainted with young Bonnie Parker while she was working in Marco's Cafe in Dallas. Because of her good looks, many of the male customers would flirt with her. Hinton was always gentlemanly and treated Bonnie with respect. Hinton admitted in a later biography that he had a crush on Bonnie, which made it difficult for him as one of the men on the team sent to kill her and her lover, Clyde. Controversy Hinton wrote a book called Ambush in 1977, which was published in 1979, two years after his death, in which he maintained that Ivy T. Methvin was forced to lure Bonnie and Clyde into the ambush site by Frank Hamer. The original story was that Methvin had agreed to plot the ambush if his son Henry Methvin received a pardon. Hinton claimed that a deal was reached by the members of the Posse whereby the last surviving member would tell this version of events after all others had died. This member happened to be Hinton. His version of events is disputed. Aftermath Hinton remained a deputy sheriff until 1941. An accomplished pilot, he gave flying instructions to new recruits in the Army Air Corps just prior to World War II. Hinton subsequently owned a motel and restaurant.

There are two facet joints in each spinal motion segment and each facet joint is innervated by the recurrent meningeal nerves. The biomechanical function of each pair of facet joints is to guide and limit movement of the spinal motion segment. In the lumbar spine, for example, the facet joints function to protect the motion segment from anterior shear forces, excessive rotation and flexion. Facet joints appear to have little influence on the range of side bending (lateral flexion). These functions can be disrupted by degeneration, dislocation, fracture, injury, instability from trauma, osteoarthritis, and surgery. In the thoracic spine the facet joints function to restrain the amount of flexion and anterior translation of the corresponding vertebral segment and function to facilitate rotation. Cavitation of the synovial fluid within the facet joints is responsible for the popping sound (crepitus) associated with manual spinal manipulation, commonly referred to as \\"cracking the back.\\" The facet joints, both superior and inferior, are aligned in a way to allow flexion and extension, and to limit rotation. This is especially true in the lumbar spine. Facet joint arthritis In large part due to the mechanical nature of their function, all joints undergo degenerative changes with the wear and tear of age. This is particularly true for joints in the spine, and the facet joint in particular. This is commonly known as facet joint arthritis or facet arthropathy. As with any arthritis, the joint can become enlarged due to the degenerative process. Even small changes to the facet joint can narrow the intervertebral foramen, possibly impinging on the spinal nerve roots within. Diagnosis Facet joint arthritis often manifests as a dull ache across the back. However like many deep organs of the body it can be experienced by the patient in a variety of referral pain patterns. The location of facet joints, deep in the back and covered with large tracts of paraspinal muscles, further complicate the diagnostic approach. Typically facet joint arthritis is diagnosed with specialized physical examination by specialist physicians. Advanced imaging such as MRI or CT may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other conditions. Treatment Illustration depicting facet joint block Conservative treatment of facet joint arthritis involves physical therapy or osteopathic medicine, with muscle strengthening, correction of posture, and biomechanics being the key. More advanced cases can involve severe inflammatory responses in the Z-joint, not unlike a swollen arthritic knee. Corticosteroid injections may provide temporary pain relief anywhere from days to several months. With repeated injections, sometimes the patient may experience a more permanent improvement in their symptoms. Steroid injections are typically performed under image guidance to ensure accuracy given the complex shape and deep location of the facet.NASS on facet joint injections Radiofrequency ablation or lesioning, also known as rhizolysis, can be used to give longer lasting relief by destroying the nerves that supply the facet joint (medial branch nerves). Finally, surgery in the form of a facetectomy can be performed in certain cases, particularly when the nerve root is affected.

Plot Kim Rae-won plays Choi Seung-hee, a young director who just made a successful international film debut. Following his success in Australia, he meets the girl of his dreams, Lee Hye-su (Jung Ryeo-won), an aspiring musician. After spending a lovestruck romp on Australia, they planned to get married. Hye-su, however, discovers her mother does not approve of Choi. Driving to eat out one day, Seung-hee suddenly proposes to Hye-su, and while putting the ring on her finger, Seung-hee careens wildly on the road to get out the way of a truck. The accident causes Lee's death. Choi then spends the next three years in seclusion, drinking and holing himself up in his apartment. Han Jeong-hoon (Park Si-hoo), who runs a film company, urges Director Kim to finish his grieving and to start working on film again. Choi pulls all his energy to push Hye-su out of his thoughts. On the day he decided to go out and to continue working, he sees a young woman at the sidewalk who looked exactly like his beloved Hye-su. Struck by the utter similarity, he starts to follow the girl to her hometown, which turned out to be a far-flung province. The girl, named Kim Bok-shil (also played by Jung Ryeo-won), realizing Choi had nowhere else to stay for the night, offers her home as an inn. Being poor, she considers all opportunities a chance to get good money. After spending the night at the fake inn, the two also spends the morning together searching for fresh mountain water and encountering a wild boar in the process. Choi does not reveal his identity to Kim, and Kim mistakes him for a bum waiting to pass a long overdue exam. While walking on the countryside, Choi is inspired by the beauty of his surroundings and gets ready to prepare for his next film. He then returns to Seoul and later comes back to Kim's village to shoot. They see each other again, and Bok-shil realizes Seung-hee is a renowned director. Bok-shil then positions herself as a rice- server for the crew and comes to the set everyday. By a stroke of luck, Han Jeong-hoon, also on the set, absent-mindedly offers Bok-shil a job at the film company. Jeong-hoon is also struck by the similarity of Bok-shil and Hye-su. Bok-shil starts work in Seoul as an assistant for Director Choi. In the hopes of saving enough money for her mother's surgery, Bok-shil braves the demands of her work despite her clumsy and awkward ways. Seung-hee finds himself being attracted to Bok-shil because of her face, initially, and then later on because of her unique charm and humor. Hye-su's family, by chance, sees Bok- shil and realizes she is the long lost sister of Hye-su. Hye-su's mother, determined not to lose another daughter, runs an investigation to find out Bok-shil's real identity. Proving that Bok-shil is really Lee Hye-rim, her lost younger daughter, she pleads Bok-shil/Hye-rim to leave her rural life and adopted mother to embrace her true lineage. Through Yoon Mi-hyeon (Kang Jeong- hwa), the film company's music director who turned to be her cousin, Bok-shil realizes she is the sister of Hye-su, Director Choi's former girlfriend. She is now conflicted on how to tell the truth to Seung-hee, who is now also falling for her. After the initial shock and confusion, Seung-hee was able to overcome his fears and admits he is in love with Hye-rim as Kim Bok-shil. Bok- shil's real mother, pained yet again due to her younger daughter's choice, becomes determined to put an end to the relationships. Her hate for the director has come full-circle, and Choi now has the chance to do what he wasn't able to do for Hye-su.

Helicopter training is done on the Bell CH-139 Jet Ranger and the Bell 412 helicopter (retired Bell CH-146 Griffons). Multi-engine training is conducted on the Beechcraft King Air C-90B. The school is based at the Portage la Prairie Southport Airport (formerly Canadian Forces Base Portage la Prairie) and operates as part of 15 Wing Moose Jaw. The service companies of KF Defence Programs and Southport Aerospace Centre provide all support services for 3 CFFTS, including aircraft maintenance and airfield operations. 3 CFFTS uses civilian pilots to teach primary pilot training and the air navigator courses. Military pilots are employed to teach the helicopter and multi-engine aircraft courses. History Beechcraft C-90A King Air belonging to KF Defence Programs and assigned to 3CFFTS, August 2010 Portage la Prairie has been the site of military primary flight training since World War II, when it was home to No. 14 Elementary Flying Training School, part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Following the war the base was retained as the home of the 3 Flying Training School (3 FTS) Royal Canadian Air Force, the direct ancestor of 3 CFFTS.Barris, Ted: Behind the Glory, page ff. MacMillan Canada, 1992. 3 CFFTS was first formed on 1 July 1970 at CFB Portage la Prairie. It was made up of personnel and equipment drawn from 1 Primary Flying School, CFB Borden who flew the de Havilland Canada CT-120 Chipmunk trainers, 4 Flying Training School, CFB Rivers who flew Hiller CH-112 Nomad helicopters and 3 Flying Training School, Portage la Prairie who flew the Beech CT-128 Expeditor multi-engine trainer. During 1971 the Chipmunks were replaced with the Beechcraft CT-134 Musketeers and the Nomads were replaced by Bell CH-136 Kiowas. During the 1970s the school created two air demonstration teams, staffed by instructors, the Dragonflies, flying the CH-136 Kiowa and the Musket Gold with CT-134 Musketeer. During 1981 the CT-134 Musketeers were in need of replacement and a newer version, the Beechcraft C23 Sundowners was procured as the CT-134A Musketeer. At the same time the CH-136 Kiowas were returned to the tactical helicopter squadrons that they had come from and were replaced by new-purchase CH-139 Jet Rangers. During 1992 CFB Portage la Prairie was closed and the base facilities turned over to a new civil organization, the Southport Aerospace Centre. All previous support functions, including the provision of aircraft and their maintenance and the running of the airport, was contacted out to civilian companies. This new Contracted Flight Training and Support Program resulted in the Musketeers being replaced with Slingsby T-67C Firefly trainers. The military instructors who had taught the Primary Flying Course were replaced by contract civilian instructors. Grob G-120A badge, 2008 Multi-engine and helicopter training was conducted by military instructors using the Beech C90A King Air and the CH-139 Jet Rangers. In 2005 a $1.77 billion, 20-year Contracted Flying Training and Support Contract was awarded to Allied Wings, now called KF Defence Programs to continue the program to 2025. This resulted in the following equipment changes: * Slingsby T-67C Fireflies replaced with Grob G-120As * C-90A King Airs replaced with Raytheon C-90B King Airs. * CH-139 Jet Rangers refurbished * Nine former CH-146 Griffons added to the 3 CFFTS fleet for advanced helicopter training.

It was originally released in Hong Kong as Jie quan yingzhua gong (literal: Jeet Kune the Claws and the Supreme Kung Fu), and has been informally called Chinese Connection III. It continues the story of Chen Shen (Bruce Li) from Fist of Fury II, the brother of the Bruce Lee character in Fist of Fury.

This DVD makes my DVDS for Chinese Connection 2 and Exit the Dragon look like Criterion releases! The film has horrible compression artifacts and the audio transfer that has high pitched cracking whenever a character talks.

It is located in the Belgrade's municipality of Palilula.  Location  Glogonjski Rit is located in the northern, Banat section of the municipality, 18 kilometers north of downtown Belgrade and 3 kilometers east of the Zrenjaninski put road which connects Belgrade with the town of Zrenjanin in Vojvodina. The settlement is built in the central part of the marsh of Panƒçevaƒçki Rit, on the Sibnica canal.  Name  The locality was formerly known as Lepu≈°nica. The settlement was named after the nearby village of Glogonj in Panƒçevo municipality in Vojvodina and means Glogonj marsh. It is a local center of the sport fishing.  History  As almost all of the settlements in the Panƒçevaƒçki Rit, it was developed after 1947 for housing workers employed in the melioration and later those who became workers of the PKB agricultural company, so even today Glogonjski Rit is surrounded by the PKB plantations. Originally, it grew fast and was nicely arranged and kept. Streets were paved with avenues of plane trees, the settlement had a park, an ambulance and a school. It looked so nice that Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito took foreign guests to visit Glogonjski Rit, including presidents of Algeria, China and Egypt. It was one of 9 settlements developed for PKB. But, as the PKB's fortune changed to worse, so did the state of the settlement which is today neglected and deteriorated. The settlers were completely dependent on the PKB, but now they were being left without work. In 2010s depopulation accelerated as inhabitants were moving closer to Belgrade, along the Ovƒça road or to Borƒça. With the PKB's collapse and subsequent dubious selling to Al Dahra Agricultural Company, the PKB machines stopped clearing the access road during winter, while public transportation connecting Glogonjski Rit to Belgrade thinned significantly. During NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999, NATO aircraft targeted the fuel tank of the petrol station near Glogonjski Rit.  Characteristics  Until the 1970s Glogonjski Rit was statistically a separate settlement. Since then, it was administratively attached to Padinska Skela, 5 kilometers to the west, even though the two settlements make no continuous built-up area. If Dunavski Venac would detach from Palilula and become a separate municipality (process began in 2006) it is said that Glogonjski Rit would also be detached from Padinska Skela into a separate settlement again. On the location planned for the swimming pool, a church was built. It is a small edifice, made of red brick and is dedicated to the Feast of the Cross. The settlement has its own football club \\"Lepu≈°nica\\", which preserved the original name of the locality.  Demography  While it was a separate settlement, according to the official censuses, Glogonjski Rit had a population of 1,259 in 1961 and 1,293 in 1971.

It was shown on the Australian Television Network, which later became the Seven Network. Its central character is a Great Dane who conducts a medical practice by aeroplane in outback Australia, similar to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The series was devised and written by the leading Melbourne architect Robin Boyd.

Cartoons were drawn by Joy Murray and Janice Male who studied together at Melbourne Technical College (now RMIT University). The cameraman was Ian Crawford. All characters' voices were read by Roly Barlee who was well known in Melbourne radio. Script and character advice was provided by Dr E.A. Murray, a lecturer in psychology, and Jean Lawson, a school counsellor. The theme music was written and performed by Horrie Dargie and his quintet. Additional music came from a small 78 rpm record library, together with characters' voices, narration and some basic sound effects were added together to produce a master sound mix. The animation technique was basically a moving plane running across the frame from left to right. The plane was about 5 inches high made of thick high quality art paper. It was pulled through by an electric motor in a machine that was also designed and built by Robin Boyd.

One of the rare gilded-age hotels built by a woman entrepreneur, the Hotel Richmond is now owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, which uses it as its Ninth Street Office Building, currently housing the Office of the Attorney General. History The Hotel Richmond was built in 1904 by entrepreneuse Adeline Detroit Atkinson, with first phase by Harrison Albright and second by John Kevan Peebles, the latter architect of the wings of Virginia's State Capitol on Capitol Square. It sits across Grace Street from St. Paul's Church, and next to St. Peter's Church. It sits on the site of the St. Clare Hotel, which was demolished for the new hotel. Mrs. Atkinson ran the Lexington Hotel at 13th and Main Streets. Atkinson, a Lexington native, came to Richmond with her husband. On his death, she took over the business. By all accounts she was a feisty woman, making sure that hotels were taxed fairly, instead of favoring the Jefferson Hotel. If not, she threatened to locate in another city where \\"taxes were not so high.\\" At the time, the Richmond Times-Dispatch called her the \\"personification of energy, industry and luck. Her business hours are from sunrise to sunrise\\" and is \\"tireless as a swallow on the wing.\\" Her energy got her into trouble as she bucked the city establishment. The Times-Dispatch on April 26, 1903 said that during her attempt to build the Hotel Richmond, she threatened to leave the city if she was not taxed at a more equitable rate for her Lexington as compared to the Murphy Hotel and the Jefferson Hotel. Indeed, she would not build the Hotel Richmond until she felt she was taxed at a more fair rate. She told the papers that: \\"I feel that I am being discriminated against because I am a woman, but if I am not wanted here, I can easily go somewhere else.\\" The Richmond News Leader reported April 29, 1903 that she was \\"fuming and fretting\\" because of a high license fee that was to be placed on the hotel. Her issues with the city were not all about being a woman: she also stridently defended her use of \\"colored\\" men to do some of the excavation work. The May 9, 1903 demolition that preceded the building of the Hotel Richmond was newsworthy. A neighboring house, home of the Catholic bishop, was damaged just as the demolition of the old hotel began. Miraculously, A picture of the Christ child survived \\"alone and uninjured\\" when the demolition of the St. Clare accidentally went awry. Further additions were made by John Kevan Peebles, architect of the wings of the State Capitol, and were done in preparation for the 1907 300th anniversary of the founding of Virginia; obviously, the two were meant to be part of a whole look for Capitol Square. On its construction it became one of many distinguished hotels in downtown Richmond that operated in the early part of the 20th century, including the Jefferson Hotel, Hotel Rueger, Murphy's Hotel, Hotel John Marshall and William Byrd Hotel. During the 1940s and 50s, it housed the studios of Richmond's top AM radio station, 1140 WRVA, and in 1948, it was joined by co-owned FM 94.5 WRVB (now WRVQ).Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 310 Social History As the largest hotel immediately adjacent to Richmond's Capitol Square, the hotel had a central place in the political history of the city. For decades, it was the home to the Byrd Machine. Today, it serves as the Office of the Attorney General. The hotel's mezzanine housed WRVA, Richmond's pioneering AM 50,000 watt radio station. The hotels were the center of social life in downtown Richmond for most of their history. The Hotel Richmond's mezzanine was the headquarters of WRVA Radio, which was known throughout the Eastern U.S. for its pioneering radio broadcasts. In 1940, the station began airing the famed variety show Sunshine Sue and Her Rangers, which swept the eastern U.S. with its country music. Other shows reflected a local twist, including Corn Cob Pipe Club and Capitol Squirrel. The shows that were born in the building were ubiquitous nationally and not just locally; for instance the Corn Cob show had hundreds of clubs in the U.S. and Canada. The hotel was the center of politics. Early in its life it was festooned with a Westmoreland Davis for Governor banner, and sometime in the early 19th century, it became headquarters for the state's Democratic party, with offices in the hotel's historic Parlor A. From the ballroom in 1926, the first Harry Byrd took control of the state with his famed Byrd Machine. At his inauguration party on the hotel's roof garden, he addressed the state on WRVA. In 1933, Gov. William M. Tuck set up an office in the bu, and it was there Harry Byrd took over the seat of his father. It was, according to historian Jim Latimer, the room with the best view of the State Capitol and Executive Mansion. From the room, the final five Byrd governors (Battle, Stanley, Lindsay Almond, Albertis Harrison and Mills Godwin) ran their successful campaigns, such was the room's mystique. In the 1970s, the building was the site of the state's tourism marketing efforts including the historic \\"Virginia Is For Lovers\\" campaign. Renovation The hotel was renovated in 2016 by the Commonwealth of Virginia, which relocated the Attorney General's office into the refurbished hotel from the nearby Pocohantas Building. It had previously been under threat of demolition. Richmond-based Commonwealth Architects is leading plans for the entire block. In the current plan, the old Murphy Hotel will be razed for parking and office space. Some scenes for Steven Spielberg's movie Lincoln were filmed in the building.

Lord Vlad Luciferian was later ejected from the group due to internal differences.Biography . The band is considered National Socialist black metal, a label in response to which the band has argued that its lyrics are simply \\"anti-Jewish/Christian and/or anti-religion\\". However, Gelal Necrosodomy has stated that \\"black metal to me is paganism, and paganism is neo-fascism, and neo-fascism is anti-christian, and anti-christianity is black metal. It is a circle that cannot be altered for everything fits in perfectly.\\" History  Early history (1992-1996)  The band started in 1992 with Gelal on guitars, bass guitar and keyboards, and Bestial Luciferian on drums and vocals. By the end of the year, they recorded their debut demo, Goat of a Thousand Young. The next year, they played their first concert with Kommando on bass (from Arghoslent) and Tom Philips (from While Heaven Wept) on keyboards as guests. After the show, Gelal quit the band due to his animosity toward Bestial Luciferian. The band soon split up, but Bestial Luciferian (now Lord Vlad Luciferian) tried to reform GBK, bringing with him Demonic on bass. Tom Philips was set to replace Gelal before Demonic convinced him to rejoin. This lineup then recorded the Triumph of the Hordes demo in 1994. After the release of the demo, Gelal and Demonic learned that Lord Vlad Luciferian added female voices to one of the songs without asking, and that he had messed up deals with several record companies. Gelal, now even more angry towards Lord Vlad Luciferian, fired him from the band. After this, Demonic quit the band due to lack of time, so Gelal asked The Marauder (guitar player of Arghoslent at the time) to play bass, and recruited The Black Lourde of Crucifixion on drums/vocals (Cazz Grant from Crucifier). This was the lineup which recorded the A Witness to the Regicide EP in 1996.  Mocking the Philanthropist (1997-2000)  The next LP made GBK one of the most controversial underground black metal acts in the United States. Bassist Der Sturmer (Der St√ºrmer was the name of a Nazi newspaper published 1923-1945) replaced the Marauder, and the new lineup recorded the LP Mocking the Philanthropist on the Belgian record label Wood-Nymph. The CD booklet contained pictures of the band wearing shirts of far-right bands (Bound for Glory and Spear of Longinus), leading to tour boycotts and other problems. In their first nine years, GBK had only played nine gigs. The album was refused distribution in Germany due to the allegedly offensive booklet. Wood-Nymph refused to print a new booklet and, as a result, the label soon folded due to the poor distribution of the album. The CD would later be repressed by Morbidund Cult and Drakkar Productions in 2004 and 2006 respectively.  Judeobeast Assassination to Kosherat (2001-2005)  The follow-up to Mocking the Philanthropist was Judeobeast Assassination, released in 2001. The album's lyrics focused on the inseparability of Judeo- Christianity, mocking both the New Testament and the Old Testament (Mocking the Philanthropist had focused only on the New Testament). The lyrics were much more provocative and sexually perverse than the ones on Mocking the Philanthropist. The music on the album had a more bass-heavy mix and a thicker sound, something relatively uncommon in black metal. The album was almost twenty minutes shorter, in order to fit onto a piece of vinyl. In 2002, The Black Lourde of Crucifixion left GBK to focus more on Crucifier, and he was not interested in touring Europe. The lineup for the \\"Pimps of Gennesarret Tour\\" was Grimnir Wotansvolk on vocals, Gelal Necrosodomy on guitar, Demonic on bass, and the Gulag on drums; the same lineup that would record Kosherat in 2005. Kosherat was released in 2005 on Drakkar Productions, and would be the band's final album before their disbandment. The album featured the new lineup of Grimnir Wotansvolk (later changed to Grimnir Heretik) on vocals, Gelal Necrosodomy on guitar, Demonic on bass, and the Gulag on drums. The album's central focus was on pre-Christian Judaism, mocking such rituals as the Red Heifer and male circumcision. The album also featured three re-recorded tracks from their vinyl EPs, as well as two Chaos 88 covers.  Recent history (2006-present)  Vocalist Richard P. Mills died in 2006 of drug overdose. Mills, who also went by the names Grimnir Wotansvolk and G. Heretik, was the grandson of horse breeder Alice du Pont Mills, and was the owner of the National Socialist black metal record label and distributor Vinland Winds.J. Bennett: NSBM Special Report. He released Pantheon's Ergriffenheit 10\\" vinyl record as well as Spear of Longinus and Graveland vinyl records. The label's last release was an exclusive US release of Russian far-right thrash metal band Corrosia Metalla in 2008. The same year, the last GBK recordings were released as a split album with Absurd from Germany and Sigrblot from Sweden; the tracks were recorded during the same session as the Kosherat album and were \\"exclusively planned for this split\\".Ol' Skool Gangsta Style, Bitch! . The band became active again as of 2009. In December 2009, they played Chicago's Hooligan Black Metal show, along with Heathen Hammer, Martial and Absurd.Ol' Skool Gangsta Style, Bitch!. The band also performed at Hell's Headbash III in September 2016.

As a Unionist party it advocates keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom. It is also anti-devolution, advocating the abolition of the Scottish Parliament. History The SUP was formed in 1986 by a number of members disillusioned with Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement. In the early years of its existence, the party found a great deal of support amongst members of the Scottish Orange Order. Many traditional supporters of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party and others felt that the signing of the treaty giving the Republic of Ireland a role in the government of Northern Ireland was a betrayal of the Unionists in that part of the United Kingdom and the associated Protestant community. Electoral performance The SUP has contested elections including the Scottish Parliament elections in 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011. In 2003, the SUP contested only the Glasgow, Central Scotland and West of Scotland Additional Members System electoral regions, yet failed to poll enough votes to elect any MSPs. It also contested only six local council wards in 2003, all located in the west central belt where the traditional \\"Orange vote\\" resides. In one Glasgow city centre seat (Kingston), they achieved third place. The SUP also stood for two seats at the 2001 general election, in Glasgow Springburn and Airdrie and Shotts. The party managed to retain its deposit in the former and almost did so in the latter. This was not so surprising in Springburn, for there was no Conservative and Unionist candidate since it was the constituency in which the Speaker, Michael Martin, was seeking re-election, but in Airdrie and Shotts, despite the presence of a Conservative and Unionist candidate, the SUP still managed to poll 4.5% of the vote. At the 2005 general election the party fielded its leader, Daniel Houston, in Glasgow North East against Speaker Martin again; Houston won 4.5% of the vote, almost enough to retain his deposit. The party failed to win any seats at the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections or the Scottish local elections held at the same time. According to the 2007 statement of accounts with the Electoral Commission the party has 128 members, which was up by 10 on the previous year though income from memberships fell from GBP 572 to GBP 365. It was deregistered by the Electoral Commission on 6 November 2009. However, the party appeared to have revived in 2012, when it ran a slate of candidates in the Glasgow Council elections, receiving 586 votes. It also fielded two candidates in the South Lanarkshire Council elections where their candidates received an average of 3.2% of the vote in the two wards it stood in. Campaigns The SUP campaigns against what it sees as anti-Protestant and anti-Unionist government policies. The party is often strongly critical of mainstream parties that they view as failing to safeguard the Act of Union 1707, including the major pro-Union parties in Scotland. A number of its major policies are to: * Oppose any moves to amend the Act of Settlement 1701, which disallows the British monarch from marrying or being a practising Roman Catholic. * Abolish the devolved Scottish Parliament. * End the present system of state funded Roman Catholic schools and work towards the creation of \\"multi-denominational\\" schools to cater to those of all faiths and none, in the belief that it will lead to greater social cohesion and an end to sectarianism. * Increase pensions and support for senior citizens. * Institute \\"zero tolerance\\" approaches to street crime, youth offences and drugs offences. * Significantly reduce immigration and have tighter border controls. Youth wing The Scottish Unionist Youth (SUY) is the youth wing of the (SUP), formed in February 2007 at a meeting of the SUP, after discussions on the matter of forming a wing within the party specifically for young Scottish Unionists between the ages of 16 and 25. The SUY is involved with all aspects of political activism on behalf of the SUP. It is not known how many members the SUY has.

Work In the introductory the Author of his book Drug Addicts Are Human Beings published in 1938, it is stated that this is the author's 119th published book. In addition to his work as a writer, it is claimed that Williams had treated some 10,000 patients in his medical practice. It also announces that he was an expert on the \\"chemistry and biology of the blood cells\\" and had spent ten years intensively studying cancer. His brother was the doctor Edward Huntington Williams, with whom he wrote his \\"History of Science (31 volumes)\\". He authored articles for Harper's Magazine. In his book, Chasing the Scream, Johann Hari describes how the 1931 arrest and subsequent imprisonment of Williams' brother, Edward, was orchestrated by Harry J. Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, and that Williams, after pleading for his brother's release, spent much of the rest of his life advocating, as his brother had, for the kinder treatment of addicts (which eventually led to his writing of the book, Drug Addicts Are Human Beings), including prescribing addicts measured doses of the very drugs to which they were addicted, with surprising (anecdotal) success. In his 1938 book, Williams predicted with a high degree of accuracy that, fifty years later, drug-smuggling would grow to become a five-billion-dollar industry. Williams died still trying to end the drug war, his uncharacteristic book and his efforts at speaking out in favor of his brother's beliefs almost entirely suppressed and forgotten.

Given a simplified camera model, each point (y_{1}, y_{2}) in the image is the projection of some point in the 3D scene but the position of the projection of a fixed point in space can vary with time. The motion field can formally be defined as the time derivative of the image position of all image points given that they correspond to fixed 3D points. This means that the motion field can be represented as a function which maps image coordinates to a 2-dimensional vector. The motion field is an ideal description of the projected 3D motion in the sense that it can be formally defined but in practice it is normally only possible to determine an approximation of the motion field from the image data.  Introduction  An illustration of some 3D points and their corresponding image points as described by the pinhole camera model. As the 3D points are moving in space, the corresponding image points are also moving. The motion field consists of the motion vectors in the image for all points in the image. A camera model maps each point (x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}) in 3D space to a 2D image point (y_{1}, y_{2}) according to some mapping functions m_{1}, m_{2} : : \\\\begin{pmatrix} y_{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{2} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} m_{1}(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ m_{2}(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}) \\\\end{pmatrix} Assuming that the scene depicted by the camera is dynamic; it consists of objects moving relative each other, objects which deform, and possibly also the camera is moving relative to the scene, a fixed point in 3D space is mapped to varying points in the image. Differentiating the previous expression with respect to time gives : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{d y_{1}}{d t} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d y_{2}}{d t} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{d m_{1}(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3})}{d t} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d m_{2}(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3})}{d t} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{d m_{1}}{d x_{1}} & \\\\frac{d m_{1}}{d x_{2}} & \\\\frac{d m_{1}}{d x_{3}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d m_{2}}{d x_{1}} & \\\\frac{d m_{2}}{d x_{2}} & \\\\frac{d m_{2}}{d x_{3}} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\, \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{d x_{1}}{d t} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d x_{2}}{d t} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d x_{3}}{d t} \\\\end{pmatrix} Here : \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{d y_{1}}{d t} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d y_{2}}{d t} \\\\end{pmatrix} is the motion field and the vector u is dependent both on the image position (y_{1}, y_{2}) as well as on the time t. Similarly, : \\\\mathbf{x'} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{d x_{1}}{d t} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d x_{2}}{d t} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d x_{3}}{d t} \\\\end{pmatrix} is the motion of the corresponding 3D point and its relation to the motion field is given by : \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{x}' where \\\\mathbf{M} is the image position dependent 2 \\\\times 3 matrix : \\\\mathbf{M} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{d m_{1}}{d x_{1}} & \\\\frac{d m_{1}}{d x_{2}} & \\\\frac{d m_{1}}{d x_{3}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2mm] \\\\frac{d m_{2}}{d x_{1}} & \\\\frac{d m_{2}}{d x_{2}} & \\\\frac{d m_{2}}{d x_{3}} \\\\end{pmatrix} This relation implies that the motion field, at a specific image point, is invariant to 3D motions which lies in the null space of \\\\mathbf{M} . For example, in the case of a pinhole camera all 3D motion components which are directed to or from the camera focal point cannot be detected in the motion field.  Special cases  The motion field \\\\mathbf{v} is defined as: :\\\\mathbf{v} = f\\\\frac{Z\\\\mathbf{V} - V_z\\\\mathbf{P}}{Z^2} where :\\\\mathbf{V}=-\\\\mathbf{T}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\omega}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{P}. where *\\\\mathbf{P} is a point in the scene where Z is the distance to that scene point. *\\\\mathbf{V} is the relative motion between the camera and the scene, *\\\\mathbf{T} is the translational component of the motion, and *\\\\mathbf{\\\\omega} is the angular velocity of the motion.  Relation to optical flow  The motion field is an ideal construction, based on the idea that it is possible to determine the motion of each image point, and above it is described how this 2D motion is related to 3D motion. In practice, however, the true motion field can only be approximated based on measurements on image data. The problem is that in most cases each image point has an individual motion which therefore has to be locally measured by means of a neighborhood operation on the image data. As consequence, the correct motion field cannot be determined for certain types of neighborhood and instead an approximation, often referred to as the optical flow, has to be used. For example, a neighborhood which has a constant intensity may correspond to a non-zero motion field, but the optical flow is zero since no local image motion can be measured. Similarly, a neighborhood which is intrinsic 1-dimensional (for example, an edge or line) can correspond to an arbitrary motion field, but the optical flow can only capture the normal component of the motion field. There are also other effects, such as image noise, 3D occlusion, temporal aliasing, which are inherent to any method for measuring optical flow and causes the resulting optical flow to deviate from the true motion field. In short, the motion field cannot be correctly measured for all image points, and the optical flow is an approximation of the motion field. There are several different ways to compute the optical flow based on different criteria of how an optical estimation should be made.

The project aims to bridge the gap between the communities experienced with visual metamodeling tools like those built around the Eclipse modeling technologies, such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF). GEMS helps developers rapidly create a graphical modeling tool from a visual language description or metamodel without any coding in third- generation languages. Graphical modeling tools created with GEMS automatically support complex capabilities, such as remote updating and querying, template creation, styling with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and model linking. The configuration is accomplished through metamodels specifying the modeling paradigm of the application domain, i.e. a domain-specific modeling language (DSML). The modeling paradigm contains all the syntactic, semantic, and presentation information regarding the domain; which concepts will be used to construct models, what relationships may exist among those concepts, how the concepts may be organized and viewed by the modeler, and rules governing the construction of models. The modeling paradigm defines the family of models that can be created using the resultant modeling environment. The built-in metamodeling language is based on the UML class diagram notation. Metamodels in other eCore readable formats can be used as well. Metamodel constraints can be specified in declarative languages (e.g. OCL, Prolog) or, alternatively, in Java. Once a metamodel has been created, GEMS plug-in generator can be invoked to create the modeling tool. The generated plug-in uses Eclipse's Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) and Draw2D plug-in to visualize the DSML as a diagram. GEMS extension points can be used to create an interpreter which traverses the domain-specific model and generates code. Interpreters can also interpret the model to provide executable semantics and perform complex analyses.

Academically, Vel√≠≈°ek‚Äôs work is commonly referred as grotesque, gothic, or absurdist. Vel√≠≈°ek himself avows a self-conceived school of \\"Parealism\\", and indeed the peculiarity of his artistic style eludes easy definition.  Life and work  Martin Vel√≠≈°ek graduated from the School of Industrial Art in Kamenick√Ω ≈†enov in 1983 and then from the glass-working department of the College of Industrial Art, Prague in 1989. While his exhibitions drew attention even in communist-era Czechoslovakia, it was his association with the popular avant-punk band U≈æ Jsme Doma (where he holds the honorary title of ‚Äúcourt painter‚Äú and since 1994 he is regular member of band) in the 1990s that brought him broad public acclaim. Other wide-ranging projects in that decade contributed to making his work widely recognisable, such as: award-winning book cover for the Czech classic Babiƒçka (The Grandmother) by Bo≈æena Nƒõmcov√°, his contribution to Aurel Klimt‚Äòs animated film version of Jan Werich‚Äôs Fimf√°rum, and his embellishment of Prague-≈Ωi≈ækov‚Äôs famed tavern ‚ÄúAt the Shot Out Eye‚Äù (U vyst≈ôelen√Ωho oka), where his conceptions adorn everything from the tables to the head-rests he invented for the urinals.  Interpretation  A dominant theme in Vel√≠≈°ek‚Äôs work is man, or better put, the body of man, generally closed in a space in his nakedness or before a horizon, and treated with a specific kind of crooked, or comical, baseness, that creates a distinctly black sense of humour. The pictures always have a clear composition which, along with abundant use of writing, leads to a sort of Gothicism applied with equal measure to religion or pub scenes. In 1992, however, his very human heroes provoked scandal: members of the local Catholic Church demanded that certain canvases on exhibition in the town of Znojmo be taken down or covered up. This new precedent in the post-communist world of Czech art, and the publicity that accompanied it, became a main factor in Matin Vel√≠≈°ek's speedy and unsought- after celebrity. Vel√≠≈°ek has since been the subject of two documentary films for Czech Television, Spring, Hell, Autumn, Winter (Jaro, peklo, podzim, zima, 1994) and The Civilian Parealist's Studio (Ateli√©r civilistn√≠ho parealisty, 1996).

The Scorpius‚ÄìCentaurus Association (sometimes called Sco‚ÄìCen or Sco OB2) is the nearest OB association to the Sun. This stellar association is composed of three subgroups (Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus‚ÄìLupus, and Lower Centaurus‚ÄìCrux), whose mean distances range from 380 to 470 light years. Using improved Hipparcos data, Rizzuto and colleagues analysed nearby stars more closely, bringing the number of known members to 436. They doubt the need to add a subclassification because they found a more continuous spread of stars. The Sco‚ÄìCen subgroups range in age from 11 million years (Upper Scorpius) to roughly 15 million years (Upper Centaurus‚ÄìLupus and Lower Centaurus‚ÄìCrux). Many of the bright stars in the constellations Scorpius, Lupus, Centaurus, and Crux are members of the Sco‚ÄìCen association, including Antares (the most massive member of Upper Scorpius), and most of the stars in the Southern Cross. Hundreds of stars have been identified as members of Sco-Cen, with masses ranging from roughly 15 solar masses (Antares) down to below the hydrogen-burning limit (i.e. brown dwarfs), and the total stellar population in each of the three subgroups is probably of the order 1000‚Äì2000. The Sco‚ÄìCen OB association appears to be the most pronounced part of a large complex of recent (<20 million years) and ongoing star-formation. The complex contains several star-forming molecular clouds in Sco‚ÄìCen's immediate vicinity‚Äîthe Rho Oph, Pipe Nebula, Barnard 68, Chamaeleon, Lupus, Corona Australis, and Coalsack cloud complexes (all at distances of ~120-200 parsecs), and several less populous, young stellar groups on the periphery of Sco‚ÄìCen, including the ~3‚Äì5 million-year-old epsilon Cha group, ~7 million-year-old eta Chamaeleontis cluster (also called Mamajek 1), ~8 million-year-old TW Hydrae association, ~12 million-year-old Beta Pictoris moving group, and possibly the ~30‚Äì50 million-year-old IC 2602 open cluster. The stellar members of the Sco‚ÄìCen association have convergent proper motions of approximately 0.02‚Äì0.04 arcseconds per year, indicative that the stars have nearly parallel velocity vectors, moving at about 20 km/s with respect to the Sun. The dispersion of the velocities within the subgroups are only of order 1‚Äì2 km/s, and the group is most likely gravitationally unbound. Several supernovae have exploded in Sco‚ÄìCen over the past 15 million years, leaving a network of expanding gas superbubbles around the group, including the Loop I Bubble. To explain the presence of radioactive 60Fe in deep ocean ferromanganese crusts and in biogenic magnetite crystals within Pacific Ocean sediments it has been hypothesized that a nearby supernova, possibly a member of Sco‚ÄìCen, exploded in the Sun's vicinity roughly 3 million years ago, causing the Pliocene‚ÄìPleistocene boundary marine extinction. However, other findings cite the distance at which this supernova occurred at more than 100 parsec, maintaining that it is not likely not to have contributed to this extinction through the mechanism of what is known as the ultra-violet B (UV-B) catastrophe. In 2019, researchers found interstellar iron in Antarctica which they relate to the Local Interstellar Cloud, which might have been formed near the Sco-Cen Association.

She has published seven volumes of poetry and an anthology of selected and new poems. From 2008 to 2010 she was the sixteenth United States Poet Laureate. In 2011 she was named a MacArthur Fellow and she won the Pulitzer Prize. Biography Ryan was born in San Jose, California, and was raised in several areas of the San Joaquin Valley and the Mojave Desert. After attending Antelope Valley College, she received bachelor's and master's degrees in English from University of California, Los Angeles. Ryan received her B.A. in 1967 and her M.A. in 1968. Since 1971, she has lived in Marin County, California, and has taught English part-time at the College of Marin in Kentfield. Carol Adair, who was also an instructor at the College of Marin, was Ryan's partner from 1978 until Adair's death in 2009. Her first collection, Dragon Acts to Dragon Ends, was privately published in 1983 with the help of friends.Ryan told Richard Halstead (Marin Independent Journal, 2007) that, \\"There is a certain onus on publishing one's own book. So, I wasn't terribly proud to be doing that. It was the act of a desperate woman, and it did me not a shred of good.\\" While she found a commercial publisher for her second collection, Strangely Marked Metal (1985), her work went nearly unrecognized until the mid-1990s, when some of her poems were anthologized and the first reviews in national journals were published. She became widely recognized following her receipt of the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 2004, and published her sixth collection of poetry, The Niagara River, in 2005. In July 2008, the U.S. Library of Congress announced that Ryan would be the sixteenth Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress for a one-year term commencing in Autumn 2008. She succeeded Charles Simic. In April 2009, the Library announced that Ryan would serve a second one-year term extending through May 2010. She was succeeded by W.S. Merwin in June 2010. Poetry The Poetry Foundation's website characterizes Ryan's poems as follows: \\"Like Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore before her, Ryan delights in quirks of logic and language and teases poetry out of the most unlikely places. She regards the 'rehabilitation of clich√©s,' for instance, as part of the poet‚Äôs mission. Characterized by subtle, surprising rhymes and nimble rhythms, her compact poems are charged with sly wit and off-beat wisdom.\\" J. D. McClatchy included Ryan in his 2003 anthology of contemporary American poetry. McClatchy included the following poems in this anthology: \\"Paired Things\\", \\"Mirage Oases\\", \\"A Cat/A Future\\", \\"The Old Cosmologists\\", \\"That Will to Divest\\", and \\"Drops in the Bucket\\". He wrote in his introduction, \\"Her poems are compact, exhilarating, strange affairs, like Satie miniatures or Cornell boxes. ‚Ä¶ There are poets who start with lived life, still damp with sorrow or uncertainty, and lead it towards ideas about life. And there are poets who begin with ideas and draw life in towards their speculations. Marianne Moore and May Swenson were this latter sort of artist; so is Kay Ryan.\\" Ryan's poems are often quite short. In one of the first essays on Ryan, Dana Gioia wrote about this aspect of her poetry. \\"Ryan reminds us of the suggestive power of poetry‚Äìhow it elicits and rewards the reader‚Äôs intellect, imagination, and emotions. I like to think that Ryan‚Äôs magnificently compressed poetry ‚Äì along with the emergence of other new masters of the short poem like Timothy Murphy and H.L. Hix and the veteran maestri like Ted Kooser and Dick Davis ‚Äì signals a return to concision and intensity.\\" Ryan tends to avoid using the personal \\"I\\" in her poetry, claiming that she \\"didn‚Äôt want confession. [She] didn‚Äôt want to be Anne Sexton.\\" Though distanced, her work is often deeply introspective, analyzing both the nature of the mind and the ability of language to mold reality. Many reviewers have noted an affinity between Ryan's poetry and Marianne Moore's. In addition to the oft-remarked affinity with Moore, affinities with poets May Swenson, Stevie Smith, Emily Dickinson, Wendy Cope, and Amy Clampitt have been noted by some critics. Thus Katha Pollitt wrote that Ryan's fourth collection, Elephant Rocks (1997), is \\"Stevie Smith rewritten by William Blake\\" but that Say Uncle (2000) \\"is like a poetical offspring of George Herbert and the British comic poet Wendy Cope.\\" Another reviewer of Say Uncle (2000) wrote of Ryan, \\"Her casual manner and nods to the wisdom tradition might endear her to fans of A. R. Ammons or link her distantly to Emily Dickinson. But her tight structures, odd rhymes and ethical judgments place her more firmly in the tradition of Marianne Moore and, latterly, Amy Clampitt.\\" Ryan's wit, quirkiness, and slyness are often noted by reviewers of her poetry, but Jack Foley emphasizes her essential seriousness. In his review of Say Uncle he writes, \\"There is, in short, far more darkness than 'light' in this brilliant, limited volume. Kay Ryan is a serious poet writing serious poems, and she resides on a serious planet (a word she rhymes with 'had it'). Ryan can certainly be funny, but it is rarely without a sting.\\" Some of these disjoint qualities in her work are illustrated by her poem \\"Outsider Art\\", which Harold Bloom selected for the anthology The Best of the Best American Poetry 1988‚Äì1997. Ryan is also known for her extensive use of internal rhyme. She refers to her specific methods of using internal rhyme as \\"recombinant rhyme.\\" She claims that she had a hard time \\"tak[ing] end-rhyme seriously,\\" and uses recombinant rhyme to bring structure and form to her work. As for other types of form, Ryan claims that she cannot use them, stating that it is \\"like wearing the wrong clothes.\\" Honors and awards Ryan's awards include a 1995 award from the Ingram Merrill Foundation, the 2000 Union League Poetry Prize, See also the Union League article. the 2001 Maurice English Poetry Award for her collection Say Uncle, a fellowship in 2001 from the National Endowment for the Arts, a 2004 Guggenheim Fellowship, and the 2004 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. Her poems have been included in three Pushcart Prize anthologies, and have been selected four times for The Best American Poetry; \\"Outsider Art\\" was selected by Harold Bloom for The Best of the Best American Poetry 1988‚Äì1997. Since 2006, Ryan has served as one of fourteen Chancellors of The Academy of American Poets. On January 22, 2011, Ryan was listed as a finalist for a 2011 National Book Critics Circle Award. On April 18, 2011, she won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, calling her collection The Best of It: New and Selected Poems (Grove Press) \\"a body of work spanning 45 years, witty, rebellious and yet tender, a treasure trove of an iconoclastic and joyful mind.\\"\\"The 2011 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Poetry\\".

The album is a tour book of City images; The tourists, the subway, the West Side, Rivington Street, a circus at Washington Square where one meets Bo Diddley, a Broadway night out with Annie, where we encounter a saddened aging actress whose best years are far behind her. A protest and a chilling reminder of the modern dangers we all face in today's world. The album is a portrait of the maze of iron, stone, and people that makes New York so unique, while mocking its opulence; still Nile always finds his way back home to the \\"Streets of New York\\".

It opened on August 15, 1892, when the South Side Elevated Railroad extended service south to serve the World Columbian Exposition in 1893.  History  The original station, designed by Myron H. Church, was a brick building with some Queen Anne-style elements. 43rd is typical of the other South Side Elevated Railroad elevated stations and consists of two side docks covered with tin canopies. In July 1959, auxiliary exit stairs were added to the station to streamline passenger traffic on the wharves. Similar steps have been laid at the same time in the Indiana and 47th stations which, like 43rd, were busy at peak times. On April 1, 1974, the main entrance to the station was destroyed by fire, and auxiliary exits were used to keep the station open. Work quickly began on a new entrance and in 1976, the new entrance was inaugurated. Some aspects of the station were very modern at the time, such as the large translucent porthole (more visible today) on the east side of the building, and the name of the station being oversized in the ticket hall. Unlike the entrance to the station the wooden platforms were still the originals of 1892, they were replaced in 1990 during two months of work. During the renovation of the Green Line from 1994 to 1996, little work was needed as 43rd station received new painting, the porthole on the wall is filled with bricks to be able to put elevators on the platform and make the station accessible to people with disabilities. 43rd station reopened with the rest of the Green Line on May 12, 1996, without work being finished. On February 27, 1997, the bridge over the platforms opened, thereby finishing the renovation.

(Swedish: K√∂rkarlen) is a 1912 novel by the Swedish author Selma Lagerl√∂f. It was translated into English by William Frederick Harvey in 1921. Lagerl√∂f was commissioned to write it by a Swedish association as a means of public education about tuberculosis (\\"consumption\\"). It has been dramatized for the screen twice in Sweden and once in France, under various English titles of The Phantom Carriage, The Phantom Chariot, The Stroke of Midnight, and Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness. Plot The novel is set in a small town in Sweden at the beginning of the 20th century. Edith, a young \\"Slum Sister\\" (social worker) in the service of the Salvation Army is on her death bed dying of \\"consumption\\" (tuberculosis). She requests that before she dies, she would like to again see David Holm, one of her charges. It becomes apparent that the two have a special relationship. A year earlier, he was the first patron of the newly opened social welfare house that Edith had founded. He also had infected her at the time with tuberculosis after she stayed up all night mending his torn and infected coat. Over the next year Edith wanted to help him, but he was a violent alcoholic and always cruelly rejected her. This only increased her resolve and Edith developed a deep love for David. Edith then learned David is married with children, but they had to leave home because David was so violent. Edith persuades David's wife to return home, but they are treated worse than ever by David. This makes Edith feel guilty, as David threatens to deliberately infect his children with TB. On her death bed, Edith now wants to try one last time to put things in order. Meanwhile, David is sitting in the park with drinking buddies and telling them a horrible story about the coachman of death - as it happens, the last person to die each year is recruited by Death incarnate to travel for the next year picking up the souls of the dead in the Phantom Carriage. David heard this story from his friend George, who died last year on New Year's Eve. After more drinking, David gets into a fight with his companions, is hit in the chest and suffers a hemorrhage (a complication of TB) and falls lifeless to the ground. At the same moment the clock strikes midnight. None other than David's old friend George then appears in the Phantom Carriage. David now has to replace George and serve as the driver for a year of death. When David refuses, Georges binds him and throws him into the death cart. Now a ghostly apparition, George takes David to see the people that David loved most and whom he has most harmed. First they visit the dying Edith. When David learns that Edith has loved him, he softens and falls to his knees in front of Edith. Edith can now die in peace, and Georges commands her soul from her body. David and Georges then go to a prison in which David's younger brother is incarcerated. The brother had been led astray by David, starting with drinking alcohol and then committing a murder. Now, David's brother is dying of TB. The brother regrets that he his failed to fulfill a promise he once made to a sick child to see the ocean. David vows that he will fulfill his brother's promise, and so David's brother dies in peace. Finally, George and David go to David's wife. She has decided to kill herself and the children, life with David is no longer tolerable and she sees no way out. David feels love for his children for the first time in his life. David pleads with George to allow his soul to return to his body so that he may stop his wife from killing herself and the children. This Georges does and David redeems himself to his wife in a tear filled reunion. Georges will serve another year as driver to the dead. David prays the New Year's prayer that he has learned from George, God, let my soul come to maturity before being harvested. Background An illustration of Les Merveilles de la nuit de No√´l showing the Ankou riding his chariot, 1844. In some European folklore the last dead person of the year in a village becomes the charioteer of death for the next year. Selma Lagerl√∂f was commissioned by a Swedish association to write an essay on tuberculosis (\\"consumption\\") and its control. Lagerl√∂f had a personal interest in the disease; her older sister Anna and their young child had it. Before the invention of antibiotics, tuberculosis was widespread and feared, public education was important. Since Lagerl√∂f could better express herself in a narrative way, rather than a treatise, she proposed to write the novel K√∂rkarlen. Lagerl√∂f built into the structure of the novel lessons on how to avoid contracting the disease. She includes scenes of the consequences of coughing in public, hygiene and sterilization of clothing. More so than in her earlier works, she deals with concrete social ills of the day - alcoholism, domestic violence. Her experiences of social deprivation as a young teacher in the southern Swedish town of Landskrona help inform the novel. However far from a novel of social realism, her characters take on mythic qualities, David Holm is a personification of evil. In contrast to the concrete social ills is the story of a ghostly carriage of death and its rider. In none of the works of Selma Lagerl√∂f is the role of the supernatural so dominant as in K√∂rkarlen. In a letter to Sophie Elkan, Selma Lagerl√∂f wrote that in the evening, when she was alone in her room working on the novel, she sometimes had the feeling that only a thin curtain separated her from the other world. This feeling is a basic motif of K√∂rkarlen.

Early years Duff was born in Columbus, Ohio, but as a child, headed west with his family to Tustin, California, where he played football for Foothill High School. His older brother, John, also played football and went to New Mexico to play collegiately. However, Jamal played his college football at San Diego State University, carrying a major in graphic design. As a junior in 1993, Duff was named the Aztecs' Outstanding Defensive Player of the Year. As a senior, he notched 35 tackles and 7.5 sacks and was a second-team All-Western Athletic Conference selection. As a professional Following in his older brother's footsteps yet again, (his brother was a tight end for the Raiders) Jamal Duff went to the NFL where he was drafted in the sixth round of the 1995 NFL Draft by the New York Giants, Duff played in all but one of New York's 16 regular- season games, starting two at defensive end, and recording four sacks. After spending the 1996 season on injured reserve with a foot injury, Duff signed with the Washington Redskins, playing 26 games over two seasons (1997‚Äì98) and recording five sacks. After Duff was released, he appeared in training camp with the 2000 Oakland Raiders but did not make the team. The following spring, the Los Angeles Xtreme of the ill-fated XFL came calling; LA head coach Al Luginbill had coached Duff at San Diego State in 1993. Duff became a fan favorite as one of the Xtreme's top defensive players (recording 18 tackles and four sacks), but also for his nickname. Thanks to an XFL rule that allowed players to put anything they wanted on the backs of their jerseys (within reason), Duff decided to name himself after an underground black comic strip character: Death Blow. The nickname was a hit with fans, and probably the second-most well-known in the entire XFL, after Rod Smart's moniker \\"He Hate Me\\". The Xtreme won the XFL's first (and only) title. Acting career While working as a graphic artist in Los Angeles, the hulking ex-football player (6'7\\" and 285 pounds) decided to try his hand at acting. He has appeared in S.W.A.T., The Rundown, The Eliminator, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Revenge, Two and a Half Men, The Game Plan, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Torque.

It aired in Canada on Space. The series is based on two Roger Corman Showtime TV-movies: Black Scorpion (1995) and its sequel Black Scorpion II: Aftershock (1997). The show focuses on a female police officer who, by night, takes to the streets and fights crime as the superhero the Black Scorpion. Episodes from the series combined into straight to video movies with 1.1 and 1.2 as Black Scorpion Returns released in 2001 and Episodes 1.1, 1.3 and 1.8 as Sting of the Black Scorpion released in 2002. The series was available on DVD in North America.  Lead character  Darcy Walker The Black Scorpion's real name is Darcy Walker, played by Michelle Lintel. She lives in Angel City (a fictionalized version of Los Angeles), where she works as a police detective. Darcy's father was shot by the city's crooked district attorney. The D.A. was arrested, but the charges were suspiciously dropped. That was when Darcy decided to take to the streets as the vigilante, Black Scorpion. In the original Corman films, the role of Darcy was played by Joan Severance. In the series, she is a red-headed enforcer with a badge who enforces the law more efficiently without the badge as her crime-fighting alter-ego, Black Scorpion. She appears to be a big fan of the color black, a fact she made clear during an interview after being asked a trivial question which would explain the color of her costume. However, as shown in the first episode, her choice of the scorpion relates to an old fable about a scorpion trying to cross a river which her father had told to her. Black Scorpion Apart from being an excellent hand-to-hand fighter and an expert with computers, Black Scorpion, just like Batman, has no superpowers. She relies on various specially developed technologies, chief among them the car called the Stingray with voice command weaponry and a disguise capability to make it look like a regular Corvette. The \\"Scorpionmobile\\" in the first episode was the movie version which was destroyed and a new version was created for the run of the series. Only one exists in the world which is owned by Nate Truman of StarCarCentral.com. She also wears a ring that shoots powerful blasts of energy and possesses a similar transformation capability to the Stingray for when Darcy needs to switch into her heroine costume in the field, like The Flash does in costume only from his lightning bolt Flash ring.  Other major characters  *Detective Steve Rafferty: Darcy's partner and love interest. Apart from Darcy, Steve is the best cop on the force. At present, he is on a mission to unmask the Black Scorpion. Darcy wants to tell Steve that she's the Black Scorpion, but whenever she tries, the opportunity slips away. Steve may also have a crush on the Black Scorpion, which visibly upsets Darcy, forming a bizarre love triangle between Steve, herself, and her costumed alter-ego. He is played by Scott Valentine. Of special note, Scott Valentine played a cameo in the second Black Scorpion film as minor thug. *Specs and Slugger: A pair of incompetent cops that work with Darcy and Steve. Often the pair get into car crashes while chasing Black Scorpion. They are played by Shane Powers and Steven Kravitz respectively. Of note they are the only characters, save Gangster Prankster and Aftershock, to return for the series with their original actors. *Argyle Sims: Darcy's personal mechanic, he is the only person whom Darcy allowed to know her identity unconditionally, since he freely gave her most of her more hi-tech equipment. He is somewhat a mentor figure to her at times, but his role is watered down somewhat in the series, only seeming to appear when a new gadget is needed. In one episode, he garbed himself as the \\"Argyle Avenger\\", after tipping off Detective Steve Rafferty who couldn't make it in time, in order to aid Darcy (Black Scorpion) foil the antagonist's plot. He is played by Brandon Terrell (listed as BT in the credits). *Tender Lovin' (Veronica): Argyle's girlfriend and a former hooker. She and Argyle are constantly arguing about relationship issues. She is played by Enya Flack. *Arthur \\"Artie\\" Worth: Angel City's extremely corrupt Mayor. Often involved in various shady deals either to fund his campaign for reelection or his extravagant lifestyle. Many criminals in the city are created because of this, including his own Deputy mayor. He is played by Robert Pine. *Dr. Phineas Phoenix: A scientist who deals in reanimating the dead, and creating clones. His goal is to take a criminal and reform him into a productive member of society. As a result, several of Black Scorpion's enemies return from fatal defeats at her hand (Breathtaker, Inferno and Gangster Prankster). He is played by Raye Birk. *Capt. Henry Strickland: The equally unqualified chief of police in the Angel City precinct and the morbidly obese senior officer of Darcy, Steve, Specs & Slugger and all the rest of the force. Rather than conduct serious police work, the bad Captain spends more stuffing his face and chasing after either Specs and/or Slugger whenever they getting up to something stupid. His first assignment while on the police force as a junior officer saw him unjustly imprison Ben Tickerman for a crime he didn't commit. A hallucinogenic intoxication brought on by Breathtaker showed his worst nightmare as being subordinate to the vigilante Black Scorpion who was chief of police, indicating some mild insecurities about his job position. He is played by Guy Boyd. Villains Returning enemies *Breathtaker (Adam West): The first villain Black Scorpion fought, and the reason for her existence. Due to brain damage suffered from a gunshot wound, Dr. Noah Goddard is unable to breathe without a special armor he created. After losing his career due to his condition, Goddard became the super-villain Breathtaker, and vowed revenge upon the City of Angels via an asphyxiating gas. His killing of Darcy's father is what drove Darcy to become Black Scorpion. Despite dying in the first Black Scorpion movie, Breathtaker is resurrected by Dr. Phoenix. Weapons: Gas dispensers *Aftershock (Sherrie Rose): Originally a benevolent seismologist, Professor Ursula Undershaft became the super-villain Aftershock after Mayor Worth ordered the sabotage of a machine she created that could predict earthquakes, as he had hoped to collect on earthquake insurance. With her public image in shambles, Undershaft set out on a rampage of revenge, ultimately planning on creating a massive earthquake that would demolish the city. Seemingly dying after supposedly sacrificing herself to stop her plan in the second movie, Black Scorpion II: Aftershock, the series reveals that she survived and landed in a coma, from which she awakes, and resumes her vendetta. Later died for real when crushed under falling debris, but was soon resurrected by Dr. Phoenix. Skills: Seismologist Weapons: Shockwave gauntlets *The Gangster Prankster (Stoney Jackson): The older brother of Argyle, Luther Simms was driven mad when their parents were shot by dirty cops, and he laughed, thinking it was a joke...until he saw the blood was real. Now stuck with a nightmarish permanent grin on his face, Luther became the super-villain, the Gangster Prankster, and sought to avenge his parents. Unlike Aftershock, the Gangster Prankster died for real in the second movie, and was brought back by Dr. Phoenix, when the doctor tried to rehabilitate him. Naturally, it backfired, and Simms resumed his super-villain career. He died again in his second appearance in the series when Argyle exposes him to his own lethal gas, causing him to literally explode from laughing. Skills: Criminal mastermind with a warped sense of humor. Note: Expy of The Joker. New enemies *FireArm (Martin Kove): A former cop in the City Of Angels, Jack Ames was forced into early retirement when the actions of the psychotic General Stryker cost him an arm. Outfitted with a prosthetic gun arm, Ames resurfaced As FireArm, and set out to force Mayor Worth to repeal a proposition that would stipulate the waiting period of weapon purchases. He seemingly dies when he blows up his headquarters, but not before getting his revenge on Stryker. Weapons: Prosthetic gun arm *Hurricane (Athena Massey): Exposed to the toxic waste in the city's ocean (put there by Mayor Worth's goons on his orders), marine biologist Gail Weathers gained the ability to psychically control the weather. With her equally mutated henchmen, The human-octopus hybrid Squids, Weathers reinvented herself as Hurricane, and plotted to flood the city. Powers: Weather control *Flashpoint (Allen Scotti): The top photojournalist at the Angel's Herald, Cameron Albright was obsessed with uncovering Black Scorpion's secret identity. This would ultimately be his downfall, as when he attempted to snap a pic of her unmasked face while she was facing the Red Dragons, and she used her Scorpion Ring to stop him, accidentally blinding him in the process. Now wanting revenge, despite his eyes being fixed by advanced laser surgery, Albright became the super-villain Flashpoint, and sought to blind the rest of the city, so they could live in darkness like him. Skills: Ex-photojournalist; criminal mastermind *Inferno (Brent Huff): Originally a dedicated firefighter who struck up a romance with Darcy, Adam Burns stil resolved to help people after Mayor Worth made cutbacks that cost him his job. While chasing an arsonist (who was Mayor Worth's former cellmate, and acting on his orders), Adam was hit by solar energy, causing him to burn anything he touched. Driven mad by this, Adam became Inferno, and died at the end of his first appearance. He was later resurrected by Dr. Phoenix. Powers: Incinerating touch *Medusa (Lisa Boyle): Disfigured due to a schoolyard prank, Minerva Stone was cruelly nicknamed Medusa, until the day she found magic mineral water that restored her beauty. She then developed a cement gun that turned people to stone, which she then used on all the bachelors that visited her spa in Angel City, placing them in her garden, with Steve being one of her victims. Skills: Criminal mastermind Weapons: Cement gun *Clockwise (Frank Gorshin): Wrongfully imprisoned on faulty charges for twenty-five years by then beat cop Henry Strickland, Ben Tickerman learned how to make clocks in prison, and became obsessed with time. Upon release from prison, Tickerman and his three henchmen, the tall Big Hand, the diminutive Small Hand, and the sexy Hourglass, became the time themed terrorist, Clockwise, and set about avenging himself upon the people responsible for his imprisonment, using a special device he created to accelerate their aging process. He was later killed when Black Scorpion reflected the deceive's beam back on, rapidly aging him to dust. Skills: Criminal mastermind with mastery of precision timing; Engineering Weapons: Time freezing stopwatch; Age accelerating device *Aerobicide (Renee Allman): A misandrist who, after excessive exercise destroyed her muscles and cost her the use of her legs, was outfitted with cybernetic implants that increased her strength and agility to superhuman levels. Hellbent on reducing the male population of the city, Suzy Pain now named Aerobicide and her two female goons, Bend (Faith Salie) and Stretch (Ava Fabian) targeted rich men and literally had them exercise to death, then stole their money. Aerobicide was eventually killed when Black Scorpion took control of her implants, and gave her a taste of her own medicine. Powers: Cybernetically enhanced strength and agility *Pollutia (Julie McCullough): A former student of Breathtaker, Dr. Ariel Haze was dedicated to protecting the environment, but her contact with him cost her her job. Wanting to help her former mentor, Haze attempted to steal a chemical that would help Breathtaker breath without his armor. During a fight with Black Scorpion, the chemical spills on Haze, enabling her to transmute her body into smog. Dubbing herself Pollutia, Haze sets out to kill all polluters. In her final battle with Black Scorpion, Pollutia was sucked up by the Stingray's Aero Vacuum, and trapped in a bottle. Powers: Smog conversion *Greenthumb (David Lander): A florist whose heart was shattered by Mayor Worth's bimbo secretary, Babette, Eugene Gardner turned to a life of crime as the vile vegetation villain, Greenthumb. Still infatuated with Babette, Greenthumb unleashed a deadly pollen on the city on Valentine's Day, and blackmailed the city for the antidote. He died when he was eaten by one of his own plants. Skills: Florist, chemistry Note: May be inspired by the Batman villain, Poison Ivy. *Mindbender (Lana Clarkson): Dr. Sarah Bellum once a promising computer scientist and housing advocate, implored the Mayor to fund her VR simulation research for the homeless of Angel City. Bitterly rejected she would resume her research into virtual reality when an attempted robbery of her computer system caused a surge while she's immersed in her own video game frying her mind. Now becoming the voluptuous as is deadly Mindbender, she schemed to use her digitizing skills to entrap individuals within her pixelized domain. Engineering it to kill those in the real world when they die in the virtual one. She was left trapped in her own broken reality after her defeat by Black Scorpion. Skills: Virtual Reality Programming *Slapshot: Former hockey pro and old friend of Steve's, Ricky Blade was purposely injured by his own teammates and left paralyzed from the waist down. Given a high tech battle suit that restored the use of his legs and gave him super strength, he took the name Slapshot and sought revenge on his traitorous teammates with help from his cheerleader henchwomen. He was defeated and arrested by Black Scorpion with help from Steve. Skills: Hockey playing Weapons: Cybernetic battle suit; Metal hockey stick; Explosive hockey pucks *Angel of Death: Detective Angela Archer, whose father was a preacher who was killed by a thief, was relieved of duty for excessive force. Using arsenic-laced lipstick and taking the name Angel of Death, she sought to rid the streets of all criminals with her kiss of death. Her endgame was to fill the prison with poison gas to kill all the inmates, but was foiled by Black Scorpion, ironically with help from the city super-villains, and arrested. Skills: martial arts Weapons: arsenic-laced lipstick *Stunner: (Alison Armitage) Deputy Mayor Edwina Watts is the bemoaned right hand woman of the sleazy Mayor Arthur Worth. Often made the butt of the joke due to having been scapegoated by her inept boss for every one of his failed political bankrolling schemes. She's near fatally electrocuted when a prisoner execution goes awry, having gained the power to absorb and redistribute energy. Ms. Watts takes on a new guise with the codename Stunner and wreaks electric havoc on the city of angels in an attempt to usurp Mayor Worth's position. She was eventually defeated by Black Scorpion who used her stun ring to siphon her electrical energies then stun her into unconsciousness. Powers: Electrical Channeling *Vox Populi: (Shannon Whirry) Considered to be the worst musical talent in all Angel City, Vox and her band The Bleeding Eardrums would often cause trouble after every gig they'd play.

Americanization is the process of an immigrant to the United States becoming a person who shares American values, beliefs, and customs by assimilating into American society. This process typically involves learning the English language and adjusting to American culture, values and customs. The Americanization movement was a nationwide organized effort in the 1910s to bring millions of recent immigrants into the American cultural system. 30+ states passed laws requiring Americanization programs; in hundreds of cities the chamber of commerce organized classes in English language and American civics; many factories cooperated. Over 3000 school boards, especially in the Northeast and Midwest, operated after-school and Saturday classes. Labor unions, especially the coal miners, (United Mine Workers of America) helped their members take out citizenship papers. In the cities, the YMCA and YWCA were especially active, as were organization of descendants of the founding generation such as the Daughters of the American Revolution. The movement climaxed during World War I, as eligible young immigrant men were drafted into the Army, and the nation made every effort to integrate the European ethnic groups into the national identity.John F. McClymer, War and Welfare: Social Engineering in America, 1890‚Äì1925, (1980), pp. 79, 105‚Äì52 During the movement of immigrants to America in the 1990s, Americanization was pushed on immigrants, except by one organization, the International Institute. As a form of cultural assimilation, the movement stands in contrast to later ideas of multiculturalism. Americanization efforts during this time period went beyond education and English learning, into active and sometimes coercive suppression of \\"foreign\\" cultural elements. The movement has been criticized as xenophobic and prejudiced against Southern Europeans, though anti-German sentiment also became widespread after the U.S. declared war on Germany.  Background  The initial stages of immigrant Americanization began in the 1830s. Prior to 1820, foreign immigration to the United States was predominantly from the British Isles. There were other ethnic groups present, such as the French, Swedes and Germans in Colonial times, but comparably, these ethnic groups were a minuscule fraction of the whole. Soon after 1820, for the first time, there began a substantial Irish and German migration to the United States. Up until 1885, immigrants were overwhelmingly Northwestern European (90% in that year) which brought a similar culture to that already existing in the U.S. maintaining stability within their bubble of natives and newcomers. By 1905, a major shift had occurred, and three-fourths of these newcomers were born in Southern and Eastern Europe. Their religion was mainly Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic and Jewish; Americanization became more difficult because of the notable contrasts of customs, habits, and ideals to those of Northern and Western European immigrants. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 1910, there were about 13,000,000 foreign-born and 33,000,000 residents of a foreign origin living in the United States. About 3,000,000 of the foreign- born over ten years of age were unable to speak English and about 1,650,000 were unable to read or write in any language. Close to half of the foreign- born populace were males of voting age; but only 4 out of every 1,000 of them were being educated to learn English and about American citizenship. In total, about five million people in the United States were unable to speak English, and of those two million were illiterate. World War I (which started in 1914) and the years immediately following represented a turning point in the Americanization process. In 1910, 34% of foreign males of draft age were unable to speak English; about half a million of the registered alien male draftees were unable to understand military orders given in English. At the same time, more immigrants displaced by the war began arriving. A number of Americans feared the growing presence of immigrants in the country posed a sufficient threat to the political order. Americans' awareness of and attitudes towards immigrants and their foreign relations changed dramatically with America's increasing role in the world. As Americans' views towards immigrants were growing more negative, fearful, and xenophobic, the United States resorted to programs of forced Americanization, as well as the immigration restriction acts of the 1920s, including the Immigration Act of 1924, primarily focused on restricting immigration from Southern and Southeastern Europe, in addition, to heavily restrict immigration of Africans, and a complete ban on immigration of Arabs and Asians. At the same time, a new positive outlook of a pluralist society began to progress. Origins A photo from a 1902 New York Tribune article on Americanization, of Holyoke Frenchmen taking English classes at a YMCA night school The term \\"Americanization\\" was brought into general use during the organization of \\"Americanization Day\\" celebrations in a number of cities for July 4, 1915. Interest in the process of assimilation had been increasing for many years before such programs were designated \\"Americanization.\\" The publication of a report of the United States Immigration Commission in 1911 marked the culmination of an attempt to formulate a constructive national policy toward immigration and naturalization and was the basis of many of the programs adopted afterwards. The National Americanization Committee was established in May, 1915, with aid from the Committee for Immigration in America in the pursuit to bring all American citizens together as one to celebrate common rights as Americans, wherever born. The committee was so effective that it turned into a powerful organization, dealing with many aspects of American society, such as governmental departments, schools, courts, churches, women's clubs, institutions, and groups as units of co-operation. This Committee was responsible for the standardization of Americanization work and methods, stimulating immigrant thought, interest and activity. Their many experiments were later incorporated into governmental, educational, and business systems of the country. Its services and publications were free. During the period of mass immigration, the main target group of Americanization projects included Jews and Catholics and from southern and southeastern Europe. Churches, unions, and charities attempted to Americanize the new immigrants both formally through structured programs and informally at work through the environment created by management. Americanization also suggests a broader process that includes the everyday struggle of immigrants to understand their new environment and how they invent ways to cope with it.James R. Barrett, \\"Americanization From The Bottom Up: Immigration and the Remaking of the Working Class in the United States, 1880‚Äì1930.\\" Journal of American History (1998) 79#3 pp. 996‚Äì1020. in JSTOR \\"During the late nineteenth Century, skilled Germans, British, Irish and native-born male workers built strong craft unions and settle into comfortable communities. Through their craft unions, churches, fraternal organizations, and other institutions, they created their own cultural worlds, ones that often left little room for newcomers.\\" Private agencies also gave high priority to Americanization projects. The Ford Motor Company had an especially well-publicized program. Among the religious groups carrying on systematic programs of work among immigrants were most of the larger Protestant denominations, the National Catholic War Council, the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A., the Knights of Columbus, and the Y.M.H.A. Extensive campaigns were also conducted by old stock patriotic organizations such as the National Security League, the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Colonial Dames of America. The National Chamber of Commerce and hundreds of city chambers also did systematic work. Public libraries also embraced Americanization as a patriotic duty during and after World War I. The National Federation of Women's Clubs and the National Council of Jewish Women also adopted definite and comprehensive programs of work. The organizations assisted newcomers with naturalization papers, helped reunite families, provided interpreters, warned about fraudulent offers, provided access to lawyers, and provided information about employment.Paula M. Kane, Separatism and Subculture: Boston Catholicism, 1900‚Äì1920 (2001) pp. 39‚Äì40. In the aftermath the target populations learned English and adopted American life styles in speech, clothing and recreation. They clung to their historic religions. They not only retained their traditional cuisines, but they also introduced the wider American public to the taste for pizza, bagels and tacos. Historian Vincent Cannato adds: \\"From sports and food to movies and music, they haven‚Äôt just contributed to the culture, they have helped redefine it.\\"Vincent J. Cannato \\"How America became Italian,\\" Washington Post Oct 9, 2015 Social workers generally supported the Americanization movement, but not all of them. Edith Terry Bremer strongly opposed Americanization programs before the war and wrote that Americanization stimulated fear and hate. She then served as a special agent for the United States Immigration Commission Bremer was concerned that the existing public and private agencies serving immigrants largely ignored women so she made her most important contribution by establishing the first International Institute in New York City as a YMCA experiment in December, 1910. World War I Interest in the foreign born in the United States was quickened by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Although the United States remained neutral until April 1917, the war in Europe cast attention on the many recent immigrants in the United States. Of special concern was the issue of their political loyalty, whether to the United States or to their mother country, and the long-term tension regarding assimilation into American society. Numerous agencies became active, such as the Councils of National Defense, the United States Department of the Interior, the Food Administration and other federal agencies charged with the task of uniting the people of the United States in support of the war aims of the government. The National Americanization Committee (NAC) was by far the most important private organization in the movement. It was directed by Frances Kellor. Second in importance was the Committee for Immigrants in America, which helped fund the Division of Immigrant Education in the federal Bureau of Education.McClymer, War and Welfare pp. 110‚Äì11 While John Foster Carr, a publisher and propagandist for Americanization, was convinced that the American public library was the most effective Americanization force. He joined the American Library Association on 1913, with the hope that American libraries would use his publications in their Americanization work with immigrants. A year later he founded the Immigrant Publication Society of New York, which published his guidebooks for immigrants as well as handbooks and pamphlets on Americanization topics for librarians and social workers. Frederic C. Howe, Commissioner at Ellis Island, asked mayors nationwide to make July 4, 1915, Americanization night in their communities. Impact of war Millions of recently arrived immigrants who had originally intended to return to the mother country were unable to return to Europe because of the war from 1914 to 1919. The great majority decided to stay permanently in America, and foreign language use declined dramatically as they switched to English. Instead of resisting Americanization they welcomed it, often signing up for English classes and using their savings to buy homes and bring over other family members.Thomas J. Archdeacon, Becoming American (1984) pp. 115, 186‚Äì87 Kellor, speaking for the NAC in 1916, proposed to combine efficiency and patriotism in her Americanization programs. It would be more efficient, she argued, once the factory workers could all understand English and therefore better understand orders and avoid accidents. Once Americanized, they would grasp American industrial ideals and be open to American influences and not subject only to strike agitators or foreign propagandists. The result, she argued, would transform indifferent and ignorant residents into understanding voters, to make their homes into American homes, and to establish American standards of living throughout the ethnic communities. Ultimately she argued it would, \\"unite foreign-born and native alike in enthusiastic loyalty to our national ideals of liberty and justice.\\"McClymer, War and Welfare, pp. 112‚Äì13 1920s After World War I, the emphasis on Americanization programs was gradually shifted from emergency propaganda to a long-time educational program, when a study of conditions in the draft army made by the United States Surgeon General's office showed that 18% to 42% of the men in army camps were unable to read a newspaper or to write a letter home, and that in the Northeastern, Midwestern, and Western United States, these illiterates were almost entirely foreign born. Indications were that barriers to any understanding of U.S. aims and interests were even more marked than this among the older men and the women in the foreign colonies of the U.S. Hundreds of Americanization agencies sprang up overnight. Late 20th century After the 1970s proponents of multiculturalism began attacking Americanization programs as coercive and not respectful of immigrant culture. A major debate today is on whether speaking English is an essential component of being American.  Dutch  Leonard Dinnerstein and David M. Reimers showed that immigrants who arrived during the 19th century in large numbers from western and northern Europe had mostly been assimilated. They call this process the loss of \\"Old World culture\\" including increasing rates of intermarriage outside the native ethnic group and not using native languages in daily life, church, school, or media. This process continues across generations and these immigrant groups have become more assimilated into the mainstream American culture over time.  Irish  The Irish were the most influential ethnic group regarding the initial waves of immigration to the United States and of Americanization. Newly arrived immigrants in American cities had a hard time avoiding the Irish. There was no way around the Irish for the newcomers, as the Irish were present in every aspect of American working-class society. Between 1840 and 1890, more than 3,000,000 Irish immigrants had entered the United States, and by 1900, about 5,000,000 of their first and second generations were settled in. There were more Irish living in the United States than in Ireland. Irish Americans played a major role in the newcomer's Americanization. In other words, identity in the United States emerged from dynamic relationships among ethnic groups, as well as from particular groups' own distinct history and traditions. The newer ethnic groups were not directly assimilated to the American cultural mainstream, but rather, there was a gradual process of acculturation, where newcomer immigrants acculturated to a new way of life, learning new skills and habits through their unique experiences. This form of Americanization was a process carried out partially through force and coercion, that occurred in settlement houses, night school classes, and corporate programs, where these working- class immigrants were pressed to learn WASP values. \\"A key to understanding the multi-ethnic American city is that most immigrants came to understand their new world less through such formal programs, than through informal contacts with the Irish and other experienced working-class Americans of diverse ethnic backgrounds in the streets, churches, and theaters.\\" Historian James Barrett states, \\"Inside the labor movement, the Catholic Church, and the political organizations of many working-class communities, the Irish occupied vital positions as Americanizers of later groups.\\"Barrett, p 127. From the beginning days of foreign immigration to the United States all the way to present day America, immigrant Americanization is a very complex, 150-year process of gradual acculturation. The notion that Americanization is an easy, simple, one way process is inaccurate. The main reason behind this is that people tend to hold on to their cultures. \\"The Irish who competed with African Americans for unskilled work and who were themselves labeled as \\"white niggers\\" espoused racism as part of their self-definition, as did other immigrant groups. European Americans quickly learned that the worst thing one could be in this Promised Land was \\"colored,\\" and they distanced themselves as best they could from this pariah population.\\" By the late nineteenth century, racism was genuinely rooted in the world views of many workers and was passed on to newcomer immigrants, expediting the process of class unity. Jews Jacob Schiff played a major role as a leader of the American Jewish community in the late 19th century. At a time of increasing demand for immigration restriction, Schiff supported and worked for Jewish Americanization. A Reform Jew, he backed the creation of the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary of America. He took a stand favoring a modified form of Zionism, reversing his earlier opposition. Above all, Schiff believed that American Jewry could live in both the Jewish and American worlds, creating a balance that made possible an enduring American Jewish community.Evyatar Friesel, \\"Jacob H. Schiff and the Leadership of the American Jewish Community. Jewish Social Studies 2002 8(2‚Äì3): 61‚Äì72. The National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW), founded in Chicago in 1893, had the goals of philanthropy and the Americanization of Jewish immigrants. Responding to the plight of Jewish women and girls from Eastern Europe, the NCJW created its Department of Immigrant Aid to assist and protect female immigrants from the time of their arrival at Ellis Island until their settlement at their final destination. The NCJW's Americanization program included assisting immigrants with housing, health, and employment problems, leading them to organizations where women could begin to socialize, and conducting English classes while helping them maintain a strong Jewish identity. The council, pluralistic rather than conformist, continued its Americanization efforts and fought against restrictive immigration laws after World War I. At the forefront of its activities was the religious education of Jewish girls, who were ignored by the Orthodox community.Seth Korelitz, \\"'A Magnificent Piece of Work': the Americanization Work of the National Council of Jewish Women.\\" American Jewish History 1995 83(2): 177‚Äì203. Americanization did not mean giving up traditional ethnic foods. Italians World War I closed off most new arrivals and departures from Italy. The Italian American community supported the American war effort, sending tens of thousands of young men into the armed forces, as others took jobs in war factories. Buying war bonds became patriotic, and use of English surged as the community supported the Americanization campaigns.Christopher M. Sterba, Good Americans: Italian and Jewish immigrants during the First World War (2003) By the 1920s the Little Italies had stabilized and grew richer, as workers gained skills and entrepreneurs opened restaurants, groceries, construction firms and other small businesses. With few new arrivals, there was less Italian and more English spoken, especially by the younger generation.Humbert S. Nelli, \\"Italians,\\" in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups (1980) 545‚Äì60 Cajuns The French-speaking Cajuns of southern Louisiana were not immigrants‚Äîthey arrived before the American Revolution in an isolated area that allowed little contact with other groups. The Cajuns were forcefully Anglicized in the 20th century. Children were punished in school for using French; they were called names like \\"swamp rat\\" and \\"bougalie\\", forced to write lines (\\"I will not speak French in school\\"), made to kneel on kernels of corn, and slapped with rulers. French was also banned as a medium of education in 1912. English also gained more prestige than Cajun French due to the spread of English-language movies, newspapers and radio into Acadiana. Wartime military service broke the crust of traditionalism for younger men, while automobiles and the highway system allowed easy movement to Anglo cities. Prosperity and consumer culture, and a host of other influences have effaced much of the linguistic and cultural uniqueness of the Cajuns.Shane Bernard, The Cajuns: Americanization of a People (2002) Poles The study of Polish immigrants to the United States, The Polish Peasant in Europe and America (1918‚Äì1920), became the landmark first study of this process.  Mexicans  Ethnic Mexicans are one of the largest groups of people in the United States of America. Early on, both Mexican migrants and Mexican-Americans were actively trying to become a part of the Anglo-American society. One of the examples of Americanization is found through Mexican and Mexican-American youth. From the 1910s and onward there has been a big focus put onto the youth in California. There were, and still are, stereotypes of the youth ranging from illegal aliens to trouble makers. One of the first steps to get rid of these stereotypes was through Americanization with the help of education, promoted by the Nativists in California.Sanchez, George J.. Becoming Mexican American: Ethnicity, Culture, and Identity in Chicano Los Angeles, 1900-1945. Cary, GB: Oxford University Press, USA, 1995. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 19 April 2017. In Merton E. Hill‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Development of an Americanization Program,‚Äù Hill states that ‚Äúthe public must be aroused to a realization of the great and immediate need of making provision for educational, vocational, and sanitation programs that will result in‚Ä¶promoting the use of the English language, the right American customs, and the best possible standards of American life.‚ÄùVargas, Zaragosa. Major Problems in Mexican History: Merton E. Hill Outlines a Program for Americanizing the Mexicans, copyright 1931. University of California Santa Barbara, 1999. The goal was to integrate Ethnic Mexican youth into American society so they would become truly American in the public‚Äôs view. This Americanization took over the people‚Äôs Mexican culture and made labeled ‚Äúoutwardly Mexican‚Äù culture as un- American. The Americanization efforts were also passed on through the home. From the point of view of Anglo-Americans, the best way to change the youth was through the help of mothers. Mothers were one of the preferred vessels of the Americanization of Mexicans because they were the ones that spent more time in the home and they could pass on their learned American values to the youth. In order to Americanize the mothers, they were taught through the help of the Home Teacher Act of 1915. With this act, teachers were allowed to enter the homes of Mexicans in California and teach the women how to be American and to pass on values to their children.The Home Teacher: The Act, with a Working Plan and Forty Lessons in English. The Commission of Immigration and Housing in California, 1915. Other than the mothers, another effort that was made to Americanize the youth was to Americanize young Mexican girls. Young girls were starting to be taught in schools about different American values and customs through activities such as sewing, budgeting, and motherhood.Ellis, Peal Idelia. Americanization through Homemaking. Department of Americanization and Homemaking, Covina City Elementary School. Library of Congress, 1929. The same idea for educating young girls was the reason that they were educating mothers, the girls would grow up to be mothers and have an influence on the lives of Mexican Americans in and outside the household. Education was the main focus of the Americanization efforts. Soon, it became engraved in the minds of Mexican-Americans that the best way to become a part of American society was through leaving their own Mexican culture behind. Throughout the southwest, new organizations were being created to fully integrate Mexican- Americans into society. One example is the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), which only United States Citizens were allowed to join. Found in a LULAC pamphlet is the phrase ‚ÄúWe believe that education is the foundation for the cultural grown and development of this nation and that we are obligated to protect and promote the education of our people in accordance with the best American principles and standards,‚ÄùLeague of United Latin American Citizens. History of LULAC: founded February 17, 1929, pamphlet, Date Unknown, University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History. Web. 20 April 2017. showing the organization‚Äôs dedication to Americanization. Through organizations that supported Americanization being created before World War II, there came a larger divide between Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans. The people benefitting from the integrative policies were the Mexican-Americans and they actively tried to separate themselves from Mexicans. Most of the Mexican-Americans involved in the organizations were from the middle class, causing an even larger separation of the people. Leading up to World War II, there were more tactics being used to bring the people in America together. One of the policies that emerged was the Good Neighbor Policy in which the United States promoted the idea that everyone in the Americas should be united. This brought forth the idea that everyone was considered American and people should treat one another with respect. Through the Good Neighbor Policy another large Americanization tactic emerged: joining the war effort during World War II. During World War II, many Mexican Americans began to join different units, some integrated and others segregated. To their content, during the War Mexican-American soldiers were being treated by the Anglo-Americans as one of their own in their units. In others, there was still discrimination that occurred, especially once the soldiers returned home. The efforts to Americanize were not as prominent as some people began to see that even though they were fully American they were not going to stop being treated as foreign in their own country. Other uses The term also is used for the cultural transformation of areas brought into the U.S., such as Alaska,Ted C.

This editing is done with the aim of making the work more appealing to American audiences, and to respond to perceived American sensitivities. The changes can be so drastic that little‚Äîif any‚Äîevidence of the TV show or movie's true origin remains. For television documentaries, it is an established practice in English-speaking countries to hire someone of the audience's accent as a narrator. Sometimes the script is done verbatim, e.g., the PBS Nova documentary series continued to use the BBC's original word \\"maize\\", whereas an American audience would expect to hear \\"corn\\". Media In Hollywood, many foreign film productions (most of them from Europe and the Far East) are remade into U.S.-produced versions for American viewers - adapting the story to conform to American culture. Most of these \\"Americanized\\" versions are filmed in American places, and with English- speaking actors. Examples include Godzilla, Point of No Return (aka Nikita), My Father the Hero, The Office, The Ring and House of Cards. In some cases, an original story from a foreign country is Americanized by recasting its lead characters as American; an example of this was the first adaptation of the James Bond novel, Casino Royale, which was produced for CBS Television in 1954. In this version, the character of Bond ‚Äî a British agent in the original novel and subsequent movie series ‚Äî is changed into an American agent for the TV version. Another example of Americanization is Power Rangers, which uses an English speaking cast playing new characters and dubbing over stock footage from its original Japanese counterpart Super Sentai.

In December of that same year, the southbound platform was reopened, and work began on the north platform. On May 7, 1982, it reopened in a much more utilitarian form than the original station, and normal service was resumed. On February 21, 1993, the South Side Englewood- Jackson Park Line, formerly associated with the line to Howard to the north, is diverted by the Loop and Lake Street towards its current terminus of Harlem.

It established the Board of Longitude and offered monetary rewards (Longitude rewards) for anyone who could find a simple and practical method for the precise determination of a ship's longitude. The Act of 1714 was followed by a series of other Longitude Acts that revised or replaced the original. Background The original Longitude Act 1714 As transoceanic travel grew in significance, so did the importance of accurate and reliable navigation at sea. Scientists and navigators had been working on the problem of measuring longitude for a long time. While determining latitude was relatively easy,During daylight hours, latitude can be found from the altitude of the sun at noon with the aid of a table giving the sun's declination for the day. At night, latitude can also be determined altitudes of stars with known declination crossing the meridian (including Polaris, the northern pole star). early ocean navigators had to rely on dead reckoning to find longitude. This was particularly inaccurate on long voyages without sight of land and could sometimes lead to tragedy, as during the Scilly naval disaster of 1707 which claimed the lives of nearly 2,000Sobel, Dava, Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time, Fourth Estate Ltd., London 1998, p. 6, sailors. This brought the problem of measuring longitude at sea into sharp focus once more. Following the Merchants and Seamen Petition, which called for finding an adequate solution and was presented to Westminster Palace in May 1714, the Longitude Act was passed in July 1714. For details on many of the efforts towards determining the longitude, see History of longitude. The rewards The Longitude Act offered a series of rewards, rather than a single prize. The rewards increased with the accuracy achieved: ¬£10,000 (worth over ¬£ in ) for anyone who could find a practical way of determining longitude at sea with an error of not greater than one degree of longitude (equates to at the equator). The reward was to be increased to ¬£15,000 if the error was not greater than 40 minutes, and further enhanced to ¬£20,000 if it was not greater than half a degree.Longitude Act 1714 Other rewards were on offer for those who presented methods that worked within 80 geographical miles of the coast (being the most treacherous part of voyages) and for those with promising ideas who needed help to bring them to readiness for trial. Many rewards were paid out over the 114 years of the Board of Longitude's existence. John Harrison received more money than any other individual, with several rewards from the 1730s-1750s, and ¬£10,000 in 1765. Subsequent Longitude Acts offered different rewards. That of 1767 held out ¬£5,000 for improvements to Tobias Mayer's lunar tables and that of 1774 halved the amount offered for any method or instrument achieving the degrees of precision outlined in the original Act (i.e. ¬£5,000 for a degree, ¬£7,500 for 2/3 of a degree or ¬£10,000 for 1/2 degree). The 1818 Longitude Act, which completely revised the composition and remit of the Board of Longitude, again changed the rewards, by now offered for improvements to navigation in general rather than simply for finding longitude. In addition, the Act outlined rewards for navigating the North West Passage, again on a sliding scale from ¬£20,000 for reaching the Pacific through a north west passage to ¬£5,000 for reaching 110 degrees west or 89 degrees north and ¬£1000 for reaching 83 degrees north. In 1820 ¬£5,000 was paid to the officers and crews of and under this Act.

Antiparasitics target the parasitic agents of the infections by destroying them or inhibiting their growth; they are usually effective against a limited number of parasites within a particular class. Antiparasitics are one of the antimicrobial drugs which include antibiotics that target bacteria, and antifungals that target fungi. They may be administered orally, intravenously or topically. Broad- Spectrum antiparasitics, analogous to broad-spectrum antibiotics for bacteria, are antiparasitic drugs with efficacy in treating a wide range of parasitic infections caused by parasites from different classes. Types Broad- spectrum * Nitazoxanide Antiprotozoals * Melarsoprol (for treatment of sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei) * Eflornithine (for sleeping sickness) * Metronidazole (for vaginitis caused by Trichomonas) * Tinidazole (for intestinal infections caused by Giardia lamblia) * Miltefosine (for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, currently undergoing investigation for Chagas disease) Antihelminthic Antinematodes Ancylostoma caninum, a type of hookworm, attached to the intestinal mucosa. * Mebendazole (for most nematode infections) * Pyrantel pamoate (for most nematode infections) * Thiabendazole (for roundworm infections) * Diethylcarbamazine (for treatment of Lymphatic filariasis) * Ivermectin (for prevention of river blindness) Anticestodes * Niclosamide (for tapeworm infections) * Praziquantel (for tapeworm infections) * Albendazole (broad spectrum) Antitrematodes * Praziquantel Antiamoebics * Rifampin * Amphotericin B Antifungals * Fumagillin (for microsporidiosis) Medical uses Antiparasitics treat parasitic diseases, which impact an estimated 2 billion people. Administration Antiparastics may be given via a variety of routes depending on the specific medication, including oral, topical, and intravenous. Resistance to antiparasitics has been growing concern, especially in veterinary medicine. The Egg hatch assay can be used to determine whether a parasite causing an infection has become resistant to standard drug treatments. Drug development history Early antiparasitics were ineffective, frequently toxic to patients, and difficult to administer due to the difficulty in distinguishing between the host and the parasite. Between 1975 and 1999 only 13 of 1,300 new drugs were antiparasitics, which raised concerns that insufficient incentives existed to drive development of new treatments for diseases that disproportionately target low-income countries. This led to new public sector and public-private partnerships (PPPs), including investment by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Between 2000 and 2005, twenty new antiparasitic agents were developed or in development. Metal-containing compounds are the subject of another avenue of approach. Research In the last decades, triazolopyrimidines and their metal complexes have been looked at as an alternative drug to the existing commercial antimonials, searching for a decrease in side effects and the development of parasite drug resistance.

Background On April 21, 1836, the independence of the Republic of Texas was secured by a decisive victory over the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto. Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its southern border but had sufficient military power to control only land north of the Nueces River. Although Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, the ruler of Mexico, signed the Treaties of Velasco ceding Texas territory from Mexican control, the treaty was never ratified by the Mexican Government. Santa Anna repudiated the treaty once he was released from Texan custody. Mexican forces and allied Cherokee guerrillas under Vicente Cordova and Chicken Trotter continued to resist Texan attempts to occupy the area between the Rio Grande and Nueces rivers. For the Cherokees, it was a war of vengeance following the massacre of Cherokee and Delaware Indians by Texas Army regulars in the summer of 1839. For the Mexicans, it was to prove they could return to Texas at will. On September 11, 1842, a Mexican force of 1,600 entered San Antonio and took control there, with minimal resistance from the Texans. When the news of the fall of San Antonio reached Gonzales, Mathew Caldwell formed a militia of 210 men and marched toward San Antonio. Caldwell's troops made camp about twenty miles (30 km) east of the town, near Salado Creek, and planned their attack on the Mexicans.SALADO CREEK, BATTLE OF The Handbook of Texas OnlineTexas State Historical Association (TSHA)Battle of the Salado Creek 1842 Massacre On September 17, Caldwell sent a small band of rangers to draw the Mexicans toward the battlefield he had chosen. At least 1,000 Mexican soldiers moved out of San Antonio to attack the Texans. A separate company of 54 Texans, mostly from Fayette County, under the command of Nicholas Mosby Dawson, arrived at the battlefield and began advancing on the rear of the Mexican Army. The Mexican commander, General Adri√°n Woll, afraid of being surrounded, sent 500 of his cavalry soldiersDAWSON MASSACRE The Handbook of Texas OnlineTexas State Historical Association (TSHA) and two cannons to attack the group. The Texans were able to hold their own against the Mexican rifles, but once the cannons got within range, their fatalities mounted quickly. Dawson realized the situation was hopeless and raised a white flag of surrender. In the fog of war, both sides continued to fire and Dawson was killed. The battle was over after a little more than one hour. It ended with 36 Texans dead, fifteen captured and two escaped. At the front, Caldwell's men had repelled the Mexican attacks and inflicted heavy casualties. Woll was forced to retreat to San Antonio and then towards the Rio Grande. The next morning Caldwell's troops located the Dawson battleground and buried the dead Texans in shallow graves. The dead Mexicans were not buried. Caldwell then unsuccessfully pursued Woll's forces south as they retreated from San Antonio. Caldwell returned to San Antonio, after the Mexicans successfully recrossed the Rio Grande. Legacy In late summer of 1848 (after Texas had become a U.S. state), a group of La Grange citizens retrieved the remains of the men killed in the Dawson Massacre from their burial site near Salado Creek. These remains, and the remains of the men killed in the failed Mier Expedition, were reinterred in a common tomb in a cement vault on a bluff one mile south of La Grange. The grave site is now part of the Monument Hill and Kreische Brewery State Historic Sites. See also *List of massacres in the United States References *Abolafia-Rosenzweig, Mark.

Vermeule III, a Curator of Classical Antiquities, Is Dead at 83\\", The New York Times. Retrieved September 8, 2012 born May 2, 1968) is an American legal scholar, currently a law professor at Harvard Law School. He founded the book review magazine The New Rambler. Early life and education Vermeule was born April 2, 1968, into a family of prominent scholars. His mother, Emily Vermeule, a classical scholar, was the Doris Zemurray Stone Professor at Harvard University. His father, Cornelius Clarkson Vermeule III, served for many years as Curator of the Classical Department at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. His sister, Blakey Vermeule, is a literary scholar and a Professor of English at Stanford University. Vermeule graduated from Harvard College (AB, 1990) and Harvard Law School (JD, 1993). Professional career Vermeule clerked for Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in 1994 and 1995, and for Judge David Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1998 and was twice awarded the Graduating Students' Award for Teaching Excellence (2002, 2004). Vermeule became professor of law at Harvard Law School in 2006, was named John H. Watson Professor of Law in 2008, and was named Ralph S. Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law in 2016. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2012, at the age of 43. Vermeule's writings focus on constitutional law, administrative law, and the theory of institutional design. He has authored or co-authored eight books. He teaches administrative law, legislation, and constitutional law. In 2015, Vermeule co-founded the book review magazine The New Rambler. On July 24, 2020, Vermeule was appointed to the Administrative Conference of the United States. Legal philosophy On judicial interpretation, Vermeule believes: Vermeule is a judicial review skeptic. Jonathan Siegel has written that Vermeule's approach to the interpretation of law: In 2007, Vermeule said about the United States Supreme Court that it should stay away from controversial political matters, such as abortion laws and anti-sodomy statutes and defer to Congress, as the elected representatives of the people, except in extremely obvious cases. This would require both liberals and conservative to step back and realize that the benefits of such a court would outweigh the drawbacks for both. Vermeule was thus suggesting \\"a kind of arms- control agreement, a tacit deal.\\"Shea, Christopher (October 7, 2007) \\"Supreme downsizing\\" The Boston Globe Vermeule believes that legal change can only come about through cultural improvements. In an interview in 2016 after his conversion to Catholicism, Vermeule said, Political views  Integralism  A convert to Catholicism, Vermeule has become an advocate of integralism, a form of modern political thought originating in historically Catholic- dominant societies and opposed to the liberal ideal of division between church and state. Integralism in practice gives rise to state order (identifiable as theocratic) in which a religiously-conceived \\"Highest Good\\" has precedence over individual autonomy, the value prioritized by liberal democracy. Rather than electoral politics, the path to confessional political order in integralist theory is ‚Äústrategic ralliement,‚Äù or transformation within institutions and bureaucracies, that lays the groundwork for a realized integralist regime to succeed a liberal democratic order it assumes to be dying. The new state would \\"exercise coercion over baptized citizens in a manner different from non-baptized citizens\\".Peters, Nathaniel (April 11, 2018) \\"The Ultimate Catholic Showdown? Liberalism vs. Integralism at Harvard\\" Public DiscourseVermeule, Adrian (March 16, 2018) \\"Ralliement: Two Distinctions\\" The JosiasBeauchamp, Zack (September 9, 2019) \\"The anti-liberal moment\\" Vox To achieve this end, Vermeule has suggested giving confirmed Catholics priority in immigration, allowing them to \\"jump immediately to the head of the queue\\". Vermeule describes this as being essential to \\"the eventual formation of the Empire of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and ultimately the world government required by natural law\\".Vermeule, Adrian (July 20, 2019) \\"A Principle of Immigration Priority\\" Mirror of Justice  Common-good constitutionalism  In an article in The Atlantic Monthly in March 2020, Vermeule suggests that originalism - the idea that the meaning of the American Constitution was fixed at the time of its enactment, which has been the principal legal theory of conservative judges and legal scholars for the past 50 years, but which Vermeule now characterizes as merely \\"a useful rhetorical and political expedient\\" - has outlived its usefulness and needs to be replaced by what he calls \\"common-good constitutionalism\\". Under this theory of jurisprudence, the moral values of the religious right would be imposed on the American people whether they, as a whole, believe in them or not. Vermeule's concept of common-good constitutionalism is: > based on the principles that government helps direct persons, associations, > and society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in the > interest of attaining the common good is entirely legitimate. ... This > approach should take as its starting point substantive moral principles that > conduce to the common good, principles that officials (including, but by no > means limited to, judges) should read into the majestic generalities and > ambiguities of the written Constitution. These principles include respect > for the authority of rule and of rulers; respect for the hierarchies needed > for society to function; solidarity within and among families, social > groups, and workers‚Äô unions, trade associations, and professions; > appropriate subsidiarity, or respect for the legitimate roles of public > bodies and associations at all levels of government and society; and a > candid willingness to \\"legislate morality -indeed, a recognition that all > legislation is necessarily founded on some substantive conception of > morality, and that the promotion of morality is a core and legitimate > function of authority. Such principles promote the common good and make for > a just and well-ordered society.Vermeule, Adrian (March 31, 2020) \\"Beyond > Originalism\\" The Atlantic Monthly Vermeule specified that common-good constitutionalism is \\"not tethered to particular written instruments of civil law or the will of the legislators who created them\\", so the stated purpose of the legislation is irrelevant to him. Yet he also says that \\"officials (including, but by no means limited to, judges)\\" will need \\"a candid willingness to 'legislate morality'\\" in order to create a \\"just and well-ordered society.\\" The main aim of common-good constitutionalism: > is certainly not to maximize individual autonomy or to minimize the abuse of > power (an incoherent goal in any event), but instead to ensure that the > ruler has the power needed to rule well ... Just authority in rulers can be > exercised for the good of subjects, if necessary even against the subjects‚Äô > own perceptions of what is best for them ‚Äî perceptions that may change over > time anyway, as the law teaches, habituates, and re-forms them. Subjects > will come to thank the ruler whose legal strictures, possibly experienced at > first as coercive, encourage subjects to form more authentic desires for the > individual and common goods, better habits, and beliefs that better track > and promote communal well-being. The values which Vermeule believes should be upheld for the good of the \\"subjects\\" of the \\"ruler\\" include traditional family values, traditional sexual and gender roles, and outlawing abortion. According to Eric Levitz, the values Vermeule promotes are those of Catholicism and the Christian right. Law professor Randy E. Barnett characterizes Vermeule's essay as \\"an argument for the temporal power of the state to be subordinated to the spiritual power of the Church.\\"Barnett, Randy E. (April 3, 2020) \\"Common-Good Constitutionalism Reveals the Dangers of Any Non-originalist Approach to the Constitution\\" The Atlantic Monthly Constitutional law professor Garrett Epps characterizes Vermeule as \\"an authentic Christian nationalist to whom the Constitution is only an obstacle\\". Vermeule's common-good constitutionalism argument is, according to Epps, really \\"authoritarian extremism\\" which \\"has absolutely nothing to do with the actual United States Constitution, and in many ways flatly contradicts it. ... In fact, the Constitution as such is not a binding text to Vermeule\\" since it must be, in Vermeule's words, \\"read into\\" in order to arrive at the results he prefers. In the end, Epps criticizes Vermeule's concept as a \\"banal\\" anti-constitutional theory akin to Falangism.Epps, Garrett (April 3, 2020) \\"Common-Good Constitutionalism Is an Idea as Dangerous as They Come\\" The Atlantic Monthly Levitz notes that Vermeule received little support from conservatives for his arguments, although some did object to characterizing him as \\"authoritarian\\".Levitz, Eric (April 2020) \\"No, Theocracy and Progressivism Aren‚Äôt Equally Authoritarian\\" New York In a column in The Washington Post, prominent conservative George F. Will described Vermeule's \\"common-good constitutionalism\\" as \\"Christian authoritarianism ‚Äî muscular paternalism, with government enforcing social solidarity for religious reasons. This is the Constitution minus the Framers‚Äô purpose: a regime respectful of individuals‚Äô diverse notions of the life worth living.\\" Will goes on to say about Vermeule's concept and some other contemporary conservative views \\"...American conservatism, when severed from the Enlightenment and its finest result, the American Founding, becomes spectacularly unreasonable and literally un-American.\\"Will, George F. (May 29. 2020) \\"When American conservatism becomes un-American\\" The Washington Post  Criticism  Elliot Kaufman, writing in the conservative magazine National Review, has described Vermeule as a \\"reactionary\\" and an \\"illiberal\\" following in the footsteps of German Nazi thinker Carl Schmitt. In Kaufman's view, Vermeule's illiberalism is \\"dangerous.\\" The American philosopher Brian Leiter has described Vermeule as a \\"run-of-the-mill legal conservative\\" who found an intellectual home among other \\"reactionary Catholics.\\" Fellow law professor Rick Hills has been much harsher in his criticism, describing Vermeule's recent writings as a kind of \\"anti-liberal chic,\\" or \\"a really cheap way to signal one‚Äôs willingness to offend without putting any specific cards on the table about one‚Äôs own specific views about, say, the acceptability of locking up demonstrators who offend the regime in power.\\" Personal life and views Vermeule was raised as an Episcopalian, abandoning the denomination in college, but returning to it later in life.Deardurff, Christina (October 2016) \\"Finding Stable Ground\\" (interview) Inside the Vatican He announced his conversion to Catholicism in 2016. He said in an October 2016 interview that the logic behind his Catholic beliefs is inspired by John Henry Newman, and added: Vermeule sees no viable middle course between atheism and Catholicism.

History The National Museum of Pakistan was established in Frere Hall on 17 April 1950, replacing the defunct Victoria Museum. Frere Hall itself was built in 1865 as a tribute to Sir Bartle Frere, a Commissioner of Sind during the 19th century. Once the Museum was inaugurated then the Government of Pakistan deemed it wise to constitute an Advisory Council in 1950 with a primary duty to counsel the Museum on the issues of enriching its collection through new acquisitions and purchase of antiquities and works of Arts. The Museum was shifted to the present premises (located in Burns Garden, Dr. Zia- ud-din Ahmed Road) in 1970. Objectives The basic objective of establishing the National Museum was to collect, preserve, study, and exhibit the records of the cultural history of Pakistan and to promote a learned insight into the personality of its people. Galleries Priest-King, an iconic artwork of the Indus Valley Civilization; 2400‚Äì1900 BC; steatite; height: 17.5 cm (6 in.); National Museum of Pakistan (Karachi) In 1970 there were only four galleries in the Museum. Over time the museum grew, with the building currently housing a total of eleven galleries including a ‚ÄúQuran Gallery‚Äù. The National Museum has more than 300 copies of the Quran (all are exactly the same), out of which around 52 rare manuscripts are on display. The Museum also contains an important collection of items relating to Pakistan's cultural heritage. Some other galleries display Indus Civilization artifacts, Gandhara Civilization Sculptures, Islamic Art, Miniature Paintings, Ancient Coins and Manuscripts documenting Pakistan's political history. There is also an Ethnological Gallery with life size statues of different ethnicities living in the four provinces of modern day Pakistan. The museum has a collection of statues found at the Mohenjodaro site. The statues include those of Buddhist priests, Terracota toys and other statues of deities such as Saraswati, Vishnu, Lakshmi, and Durga Devi. It also shows some ancient coins found in those hijri and some belongings of the national heroes of Pakistan: Quaid-e-Azam's pen, cuffs, and sword, Allama Iqbal's personal chair, and pen, and Liaqat Ali Khan's personal itar bottle, watch, and walking stick. There are galleries which show the clothing muslims used to make, the pottery work done by people, glasses made by Muslims and the apparatus that was used. Collection The Museum has a collection of 58,000 old coins (some dating from 74 Al-Hijra), and hundreds of well-preserved sculptures. Some 70,000 publications, books and other reading material of the Archeology and Museums Department were also shifted to the National Museum so that general public could see them. Every year National Museum holds around a dozen exhibitions on National Days and other occasions. Facilities For the preservation of the collection, a conservation laboratory is also a part of the museum. There is an auditorium on the museum premises with a 250 seating capacity.

The China Bowl was the name of a proposed National Football League (NFL) pre-season exhibition game that had been scheduled to take place in August 2007, but later postponed to 2009 and ultimately canceled, between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks at the National Stadium in Beijing. The originally scheduled China Bowl was to be played at Workers' Stadium in Beijing, China, on August 8, 2007. The game was to kick off the one-year countdown before the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and was to take place right before the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup (also being held in China), and would have been the first NFL-sanctioned game to take place in China, as well as the first NFL preseason game played outside the United States since the league abandoned the American Bowl series in 2005 (game 1 of the Bills Toronto Series held that honor). On April 2, 2007, the NFL announced the rescheduling of the preseason game in Beijing to August 2009, so that more focus could be placed on the start of the International Series, the first regular season game to take place outside of North America, which took place at Wembley Stadium, London that October. Both teams expressed interest in still playing the game, and the Patriots, having operations in China at the time, would have been an opponent either way. As a result of the 2008 recession, the Patriots shut down their base of operations in China, and the game was never played.http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3757152 The Patriots were instead assigned to the next game in the International Series, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which was played at Wembley on October 25, 2009. The Patriots won 35‚Äì7. Attempted 2020 revival In March 2019, the NFL reportedly discussed at owners' meetings whether a preseason game in China would be played during the 2020 season. The San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams were among the teams interested as their West Coast locations made for cheaper travel. Among the concerns raised at the meeting were a suitable venue and air quality. Scheduling issues (most NFL games are played in the middle of the night in China) and a corresponding lack of fan base in the country are other problems that have previously been mentioned that could prevent the league from playing there.

He was a professor at Duke University (then Trinity College) best known today for the Bassett Affair in 1903 when he publicly criticized racism among Southern elites, and called Booker T. Washington, \\"all in all the greatest man, save General Lee, born in the South in 100 years.\\" In the face of widespread outrage, the college trustees refused to accept Bassett's resignation by a vote of 18 to 7. After Duke, he became a professor of history at Smith College in Massachusetts.Doherty p 28-29 and was the Executive Director of the American Historical Association for many years. Early life and education Bassett was born September 10, 1867 in Tarboro, North Carolina. John Spencer Bassett was the second of seven children of Richard Baxter Bassett (son of Richard and Caroline Spencer Bassett) who was born September 20, 1832 in Williamsburg, Virginia and died March 25, 1902 in Goldsboro, North Carolina; and Mary Jane Wilson (daughter of John Wilson and Susannah Dunn of Maine) born November 7, 1845 in Edgecombe County, North Carolina, and died September 1, 1903 in Durham, North Carolina. Both of his parents are buried in Willow Dale Cemetery in Goldsboro, Wayne County, North Carolina. He entered Trinity College (now Duke University) in 1886, as a junior, graduating with an A.B. in history. In 1894 he earned a Ph.D in history from Johns Hopkins University, under the direction of Herbert Baxter Adams. As one of the first PhD's trained at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, he was introduced new models of scholarship to college education. Career The Bassett Affair President Roosevelt praised the university. In 1902 Bassett launched the South Atlantic Quarterly, a journal whose purpose was to promote the \\"literary, historical, and social development of the South.\\"http://library.duke.edu/uarchives/exhibits/academic- freedom/bassettaffair.html It was from this journal that Bassett began to challenge more aggressively the southern press and prevailing sentiments about southern history and issues revolving around race. In October 1903 he published an article in the South Atlantic Quarterly titled \\"Stirring Up the Fires of Racial Antipathy\\" triggering a controversy that nearly cost the young professor his job. In the article, he spoke about improving race relations and gave praise to numerous African Americans. Near the end of the article, he wrote \\"...Booker T. Washington [is] the greatest man, save General Lee, born in the South in a hundred years...\\" This led to an outpouring of anger from powerful Democratic Party leaders as well as the media and public. The most vociferous of which was the Raleigh News and Observer and its editor, Josephus Daniels. Many demanded that Bassett be fired and encouraged parents to take their children out of the university. Due to immense public pressure, Bassett offered his resignation if the Board of Trustees requested that he do so. The Board of Trustees then held a meeting to decide the fate of Bassett. In the end, they voted 18-7 not to accept the resignation citing academic freedom. In their decision, they wrote, \\"We are particularly unwilling to lend ourselves to any tendency to destroy or limit academic liberty, a tendency which has, within recent years, manifested itself in some conspicuous instances, and which has created a feeling of uneasiness for the welfare of American colleges [...] We cannot lend countenance to the degrading notion that professors in American colleges have not an equal liberty of thought and speech with all other Americans.\\" In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt commended Trinity and Bassett's courageous stand for academic freedom while speaking to the university. He told the school, \\"You stand for Academic Freedom, for the right of private judgment, for a duty more incumbent upon the scholar than upon any other man, to tell the truth as he sees it, to claim for himself and to give to others the largest liberty in seeking after the truth.\\" Post-affair career In 1906, he became a professor at Smith College in Massachusetts.Doherty p 28-29 After 1919, he was the long-time secretary (Executive Director) of the American Historical Association, and helped to stabilize its finances through an endowment. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921. He wrote numerous books on North Carolina, a major biography of Andrew Jackson, several textbooks, and produced carefully edited editions of important primary sources, most notably his seven volume Correspondence of Andrew Jackson (1926-1935). Personal life In Forsyth, North Carolina on August 10, 1892, John Spencer Bassett married Jessie Lewellin. She was born January 31, 1866 in Clarksville, Mecklenburg County, Virginia; died April 3, 1950 in Northampton, Massachusetts.

They started by playing in the local underground squat scene, publishing a couple of seven-inch releases as well as their first CD in 1997, titled Leftovers. This early material was put out on Snuff Records, which was run by Roderic and Didier. In 1998, Knut released their first full-length, Bastardiser, which showcased a sharper and more focused aggression, combining heavily distorted guitars, odd-time signatures, use of discordance and repetition, and harsh vocals. The band started touring Europe and shared the stage with bands like Zeni Geva, The Young Gods, Blockheads, Voivod and Neurosis. The year 1999 would prove crucial for Knut, with tours alongside Converge and Botch, both of whom had released records on the Hydra Head imprint. They brought Knut to the attention of label owners Aaron Turner and Mark Thompson, who quickly decided to reissue Bastardiser in the United States and invited them to tour. In August 2001, Knut completed an extensive trek on US soil opening for Isis, playing alongside Thrones, Converge, Keelhaul, Pelican, Premonitions of War, Anodyne, The Cancer Conspiracy, ending at New York's infamous CBGB club. In 2002, Challenger was released. Recorded at Serge Morattel's Rec Studio in Geneva, the album exceeded all expectations by pushing the envelope of heaviness, dynamics, atmosphere and chaos simultaneously (it ended in Terrorizer Magazine's end of year list next to Isis, Mastodon, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Queens of the Stone Age and Meshuggah). Knut kept touring as much as they could, but never as a full-time activity. In 2004, the band took a break while planning their next moves, writing the follow-up to Challenger and working on an experimental remix album (Alter, with contributions from Justin Broadrick, Mick Harris, Dalek, Francisco L√≥pez, Asmus Tietchens). Terraformer was recorded in late 2004 in Geneva, engineered by their friend Jerome Pellegrini (former Nostromo guitarist, now in Mumakil). Originally meant to be a demo of the album, the session proved satisfactory enough for a proper release. In May 2005, Roderic joined Jesu for a European tour, filling in on drums for Ted Parsons. Before the release of Terraformer, Phil Hess quit the band. Jeremy Tavernier took over guitar duties (as, in fact, he had done on most of Terraformer) while Jerome Doudet joined on bass, quickly followed by Tim Robert-Charrue on second guitar. After several European tours in 2006, including the UK with Taint and an appearance at Hellfest alongside Opeth, Nile, Ringworm, Capricorns and Celtic Frost, Jeremy decided to leave and concentrate on his grindcore band Mumakil. Christian Valleise took his spot and Knut quickly hit the road, including Eastern Europe with fellow Swiss noiseniks Monno. In 2008-2009 the band played a number of shows, refining their new formula and taking time to write what would become their fifth studio album. In 2010, they released their first new studio album in more than five years. Not content to simply recreate the sound of their past albums, Knut strove to reinvent themselves in Wonder by incorporating new melodic elements and psychedelic ambience into their songs. Festivals and tours followed, including Europe with Keelhaul, and Russia for the first time. But in January 2012, Knut announced that they were on \\"indefinite hiatus\\".

Background Bred by Daniel Swigert of Elmendorf Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, Salvator was sired by Prince Charlie out of Salina (by Lexington). (Salvator was the last great horse Swigart bred; his best stallions had grown old and died.) On his sire's side, he went back to the tremendous mare Pocahontas by Glencoe. On his dam's side, through Lexington, he carried the blood of Boston sired by Timoleon sired by Sir Archie sired by Diomed. Unusual for the times, the dark chestnut with a large white blaze was born in 1886 in California. James Ben Ali Haggin had purchased his dam, Salina, and shipped her to his Rancho Del Paso with Salvator in utero. Haggin had made his money in the California Gold Rush of 1849, so much of it he was suddenly one of the wealthiest men in America, and he used his new wealth to establish the biggest horse breeding operations in world history. Aside from the thousands of grazing acres he owned in Arizona, New Mexico and Southern California, he headquartered at the Rancho del Paso near the present-day city of Sacramento. He bought breeding horses from every state that bred fine thoroughbreds, as well as shipping them in from Ireland, Australia and England. Eventually he bought Swigert's Elmendorf Farm and moved his headquarters there. Haggin added to the property until he held of prime bluegrass. (Over time, and through several owners, this property was broken up into stud farms like Spendthrift Farm, Greentree Stud, and others.) In the fall of 1887, Haggin's Eastern trainer, Matthew Byrnes, and jockey Edward \\"Snapper\\" Garrison arrived at the ranch to choose the best young horses to take back to New York. Salvator was one of their choices. Proctor Knott vs Salvator Because he had bucked his shins in one of his trials while training in California, Salvator did not start racing until August of his two-year-old season He made his debut in the Junior Champion Stakes against a seasoned colt, Proctor Knott (sired by the great Luke Blackburn). Proctor Knott, who'd already run six races (and who in the following year would lose the Kentucky Derby to Spokane in what seemed a dead heat), was the one horse Salvator could never beat. In his first start, Salvator finished off the board. Proctor Knott and Salvator met three weeks later in the new Futurity at Coney Island and again Proctor Knott won, but this time Salvator came second by only half a length. The Futurity had attracted a great of attention because at the time it was the richest race in America. Proctor Knott, winning it and thereby winning more money than most 19th century horses in a lifetime, did not race again that year. Salvator, meanwhile, went on to win four races in a row: the Flatbush Stakes, the Maple, the Tuckahoe and the Titan stakes. Salvator met Proctor Knott only once as a three-year-old in the Omnibus Stakes. Neither of them won, but Proctor Knott beat Salvator by placing, while Salvator showed. It was a blanket finish in which a colt called Longstreet (a son of Longfellow, who was known as \\"King of the Turf\\") won. Salvator never lost again. Four days later, he won the Jersey Handicap. He also won all seven of his other races that year, while Proctor Knott won only twice in nine starts. In the Tidal Stakes at Sheepshead Bay, Salvator beat Eric, the winner of the Belmont Stakes. Salvator vs Tenny Tenny was Salvator's closest rival for three-year-old honors. They met in the inaugural running of the Realization Stakes, which Salvator won. Tenny placed. (This race is now called the Lawrence Realization Stakes.) In their fourth year, the rivalry became serious. Tenny had a low-slung back, causing him to be called \\"The Swayback\\". At the start of his four-year-old season, Tenny won four races in succession. Salvator had been sitting on the sidelines for the beginning of the year, but in his first race as a four-year-old, he faced Tenny in the 7th running of the Suburban Handicap, then taking place at Sheepshead Bay. Salvator won the Suburban. Tenny's owner, David T. Pulsifer, was disgusted with the race and challenged Haggin to a match race. They went back and forth over the conditions of the match but finally came to an agreement. The race would be run at Sheepshead Bay on June 25, 1890. Ridden by Isaac Murphy, Salvator won by half a head. Walter S. Vosburgh, from \\"Racing in America, 1866-1921,\\" (The Jockey Club, 1922) described the race like this: \\"The two horses ran side by side for three furlongs. Then Salvator led by two lengths. Once in the stretch, however, Tenny came very fast and was overhauling Salvator, but the latter 'lasted' to win by a nose in 2:05. Both jockeys thought they had won after they had pulled up, and walked their horses back, chatting as they did so. 'I think I beat you,' said Garrison.‚Äù Ella Wheeler Wilcox wrote a poem about the race called How Salvator Won. Its ending reads: ‚ÄúWe are under the string now--the great race is done--And Salvator, Salvator, Salvator won!‚Äù Meanwhile, the new Monmouth Park Racetrack had opened, replacing the old Monmouth track It was enormous, the biggest track in America, and it raced clockwise in the European fashion. Salvator made his appearance in the Monmouth Cup. Not a horse showed up to face him, and he jogged around for the $1,800 prize. After that, only Tenny came out to face Salvator in the Champion Stakes at the same track. Salvator won by four lengths. Salvator then raced the clock, shattering the old record for the mile. He never raced again. Retirement Though Tenny raced for two more seasons than Salvator, both eventually went to stud. Neither horse was a success. In 1909, when they were both twenty three years old, Salvator died first. At Monmouth Park, the Grade III Salvator Mile Handicap will be in its 69th running in 2016. Following the creation of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1955, Salvator was one of the horses inducted.

On June 8, 2009, the YPS school board unanimously passed a resolution to \\"discuss options for the consideration and sharing of services\\" with the Lincoln School District, which had passed a similar resolution. Board members also left open the option of incorporating the Willow Run School District into the talks at a future date. On November 6, 2012, voters in both the Ypsilanti and Willow Run School Districts voted to consolidate the two districts. The two districts became one unified district, Ypsilanti Community Schools, on July 1, 2013. A unified school board, appointed by the Washtenaw Intermediate School District Board of Education, was formed to oversee the transition. The final day of classes for YPS was Friday June 7, 2013.Hoedl, Chelsea. \\"Students, staff reflect as Ypsilanti Public School District dismisses for final time\\" (). The Ann Arbor News.

The track is a 40-minute drive from Ocean City, Maryland and miles from the Delaware Beaches. Attendance on some nights is boosted by fans coming via the Cape May‚ÄìLewes Ferry from New Jersey. Georgetown Speedway features a fast, half-mile clay oval that produces high speeds and thrilling racing action. The facility has grandstands, parking, a large, flat pit area, and room for overnight camping. Constructed in 1949 by businessman and auto racing pioneer Melvin L. Joseph, Georgetown Speedway is not only an historic landmark in Delaware, but is well known across the country for its role in the development of stock car racing as it is known today. After sitting silent for a number of years the speedway was reopened in May 2006. In 2015 the track was slightly shortened by reconfiguring turns one and two, bringing them in several feet further. The track had previously been believed to be measured as a half mile on the inside; now it is believed to be measured as a half mile on the outside. BD Motorsports Media LLC is managing the speedway's operations since 2016. A special-events schedule of high-profile programs was planned to bring some of the region's top talent to Sussex County, Delaware. The current management team revamped the track throughout the 2016 season, including fresh paint, new improved signage, track maintenance equipment, and a revamped sound system. Multiple touring series, including Big/Small Block Modifieds, Super Late Models, and 360 Sprint cars are now featured at the track. More improvements were announced for the 2017 season such as a lap counter and scoreboard that was purchased from the former Thunder Valley Speedway in Central City, Pennsylvania.

The station, situated at 800 E. 63rd Street, opened on April 23, 1893. It is one of three terminals (the others being on the Blue Line and on the Yellow Line) that does not have a yard assigned to it. This station is the current terminal of the East 63rd branch of the Green Line, and the easternmost station on the 'L' system. History Cottage Grove destination sign Cottage Grove officially opened in 1893 when the South Side Rapid Transit company extended its line from 39th Street to Jackson Park, just in time for the World's Columbian Exposition. The line was shortened to Stony Island and 63rd after the fair ended. Stony Island remained the terminus of the East 63rd branch for 88 years. However, on March 4, 1982, service east of 61st was suspended due to a defective bridge over the Illinois Central (now Metra Electric) tracks. Service on the East 63rd branch was restored on December 12, 1982, but only as far as the University station. In 1989, Cottage Grove was demolished and replaced with a new station, which opened in 1991. The new station was open for only three years before the entire Green Line closed for a renovation project in 1994. Cottage Grove becomes a terminal When the Green Line closed in 1994, the CTA was planning to re-extend the line from University to a new terminal at Dorchester. The new station would have offered connections to Metra Electric and South Shore Line trains, as well as CTA buses through a brand-new bus terminal. However, complaints from Woodlawn residents and Arthur M. Brazier forced a tough decision for the CTA to cut the line back to Cottage Grove. The East 63rd branch was partially demolished from Cottage Grove Avenue to Drexel Avenue to prevent in-service trains from traveling on the unrehabbed tracks east of Cottage Grove. When the line reopened in 1996, Cottage Grove became the terminal of the East 63rd branch. The rest of the line east of Cottage Grove, including the abandoned University station and the partially-built Dorchester station were completely demolished in September 1997. Operations The Cottage Grove station was never intended to be a terminus. Although the station has two platforms, the northern platform is the only one that is really ever used. This is because no fare controls exist on the southern platform, since the station originally only allowed inbound (Harlem/Lake-bound) boarding (a configuration still used by King Drive). For this reason, the southern platforms can only be used by trains that continue to the 61st or Lower 63rd Yards. The southern platform is also used by rush-hour trains that run empty to and back to Cottage Grove or to (this is done to allow a quick and easy transfer to another branch at Garfield). The one-track setup works for Cottage Grove because the station only sees trains arrive/depart every 20‚Äì25 minutes. Since the East 63rd branch was torn down all the way to Cottage Grove, no turnaround tracks exist east of the station. Trains needing to switch to the northern platform must use the crossover tracks just west of the station.

Sancho was a son of William II S√°nchez and Urraca of Navarre and relative of Sancho III of Navarre and he spent a portion of his life at the court of that king in Pamplona.

It is situated at 142 West 35th Street in the Armour Square neighborhood. The station opened on September 28, 1969 along with the other stations on the Dan Ryan branch. Currently, the station serves Guaranteed Rate Field, the stadium of the Chicago White Sox, and takes its name from this location, originally serving the now-demolished Comiskey Park (which was also known as \\"Sox Park\\" from 1962 until 1976, during the time of construction for Sox‚Äì35th), which had been located across the street from the current park. It is also close to the Illinois Institute of Technology, as well as Shimer College and VanderCook College of Music, though () is closer to some parts of that campus. On April 3, 2011, a new station opened on the adjacent Metra Rock Island Line at 35th/Lou Jones/Bronzeville. History Structure Sox‚Äì35th station is located in the median of the Dan Ryan Expressway. The main entrance to the station is on the 35th Street overpass; that entrance is handicapped accessible by an elevator. An auxiliary entrance is located on the 33rd Street overpass, and this entrance connects to the station via a pedestrian bridge. At both entrances, a fare turnstile is located at street level and passengers must take stairs, an escalator, or the elevator to the platform. The platform is an island platform; northbound trains stop on the east side, and southbound trains stop on the west side. Construction Sox‚Äì35th under construction in 1968. A rapid transit line in the median of the Dan Ryan Expressway was initially proposed in 1958, before the expressway was built. In 1966, Chicago voters passed a bond issue to provide $28 million in funding for new rail lines in the median of the Dan Ryan and Kennedy Expressways, qualifying the routes for federal aid funds. The Chicago Plan commission approved plans for the new routes in January 1967, estimating the cost of the Dan Ryan line to be $38 million; Sox‚Äì35th, called White Sox‚ÄìIllinois Tech at the time, was included in the plans. Federal funding for the lines was approved in March 1967. Mayor Richard J. Daley subsequently stated that construction would begin immediately and projected the lines would open by the beginning of 1969, though engineers expected an opening date in late 1969 or early 1970. Sox‚Äì35th and the other Dan Ryan stations opened on September 28, 1969. The final cost of the line was $38 million; the Chicago Tribune noted that it was constructed \\"in virtually record time\\". Three days before the line opened, the CTA ran free trains on the route between Sox‚Äì35th and . The new route led to the Loop in the north and continued west along the Lake Street Elevated; trains did not follow the current alignment of the Red Line north of Sox‚Äì35th until 1993. 1979 closure On January 29, 1979, the CTA closed 14 stations during rush-hour service, including Sox‚Äì35th, due to equipment shortages caused by the Chicago Blizzard of 1979. After an outcry from riders and several African-American politicians, Sox‚Äì35th and three other stations reopened the following day. The remaining stations reopened later in the week after the Urban Mass Transportation Administration warned the CTA that the closings may have been a civil rights violation. The Chicago Tribune considered the closings to be a factor in Mayor Michael Bilandic's loss to Jane Byrne in the 1979 Democratic mayoral primary, noting Byrne's large margin of victory in predominantly black wards affected by the closings. Rehabilitation project Chicago White Sox logo in the station floor In 2002, the CTA announced that it would rehabilitate Sox‚Äì35th and seven other stations on the Dan Ryan branch. During the renovations, the escalators at Sox‚Äì35th were replaced, its lighting and flooring were upgraded, and a granite tile White Sox logo was added to the floor. In addition, workers improved the 35th Street bridge adjacent to the station, replacing its sidewalks and canopies. The renovations to Sox‚Äì35th cost over $13 million and concluded in time for the 2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at U.S. Cellular Field. 2013 closure The station closed on May 19, 2013 as part of the Red Line South Reconstruction project and reopened on October 20, 2013.

It could be paid in military equipment (such as triremes) or money, most usually the latter. Consequently, a great deal of funds was paid to Athens for the purpose of military initiatives. Athens increased its military forces, resulting in its becoming a dominant and wealthy power.  Background  After the Persian War, the Delian League was formed as a mutual- defense pact and it was based on the sacred island of Delos during its first 25 years of existence. While no major conflict occurred, there exist a form of cold war between Greece and Persia punctuated by incidents such as diplomatic moves and countermoves, threats, and raids, particularly along the border that separated the territories of the two powers. At its peak, membership swelled to about 200 and, in exchange for Athenian protection, each paid phoros in talents of silver while the more powerful members such as Samos, Chios, and Lesbos supplied warships as their tribute. The list of annual tributes were preserved as inscriptions in the marbles of the Athenian Acropolis. According to Aristotle, the very first phoros (\\"that which is brought\\") was assessed by Aristeides a couple of years after the battle of Salamis. The phoros became a source of contention when it was doubled and trebled by the Athenians to finance the Peloponnesian War. In 454/3, the Delian League treasury was moved to Athens for safe-keeping after the League's defeat in Egypt, although some sources cited it as a pretext on the part of the Athenians to gain control of the league's finances. Failure to pay the phoros often prompted swift enforcement measures such as the case of Delos, which had to contend with an Athenian military action after it withheld its phoros due to discontent with the city state.

The Gujarat Sultanate was a medieval Indian Muslim Rajput kingdom established in the early 15th century in present-day Gujarat, India. The founder of the ruling Muzaffarid dynasty, Zafar Khan (later Muzaffar Shah I) was appointed as governor of Gujarat by Nasir-ud-Din Muhammad bin Tughluq IV in 1391, the ruler of the principal state in north India at the time, the Delhi Sultanate. Zafar Khan's father Sadharan, was a Tanka Rajput convert to Islam.Rajput, Eva Ulian, pg. 180The Rajputs of Saurashtra, Virbhadra Singhji, pg. 45 Zafar Khan defeated Farhat-ul-Mulk near Anhilwada Patan and made the city his capital. Following Timur's invasion of Delhi, the Delhi Sultanate weakened considerably and so he declared himself independent in 1407 and formally established Gujarat Sultanate. The next sultan, his grandson Ahmad Shah I founded the new capital Ahmedabad in 1411. His successor Muhammad Shah II subdued most of the Rajput chieftains. The prosperity of the sultanate reached its zenith during the rule of Mahmud Begada. He subdued most of the Rajput chieftains and built navy off the coast of Diu. In 1509, the Portuguese wrested Diu from Gujarat sultanate following the battle of Diu. The decline of the Sultanate started with the assassination of Sikandar Shah in 1526. Mughal emperor Humayun attacked Gujarat in 1535 and briefly occupied it. Thereafter Bahadur Shah was killed by the Portuguese while making a deal in 1537. The end of the sultanate came in 1573, when Akbar annexed Gujarat in his empire. The last ruler Muzaffar Shah III was taken prisoner to Agra. In 1583, he escaped from the prison and with the help of the nobles succeeded to regain the throne for a short period before being defeated by Akbar's general Abdul Rahim Khan-I- Khana.  Origin  The sultanate's origins lie with two Tanka Rajput brothers by the name of Saharan and Sadhu who were from Thanesar (now in Haryana). During the rule of Muhammad bin Tughluq, his cousin Firuz Shah Tughlaq was once on a hunting expedition and lost his way. He reached a village and encountered Sadhu and Saharan. He was welcomed to partake in the hospitality of the brothers. After drinking, he revealed his identity as a cousin and successor of the king. The brothers offered their beautiful sister in marriage and he accepted. They accompanied Firuz Shah Tughluq to Delhi along with his sister. They converted to Islam there. Sadhu assumed new name, Samsher Khan while Sadharan assumed Wajih-ul-Mulk. They were disciples of saint Makhdum- Sayyid-i-Jahaniyan-Jahangshi aka Saiyyd Jalaluddin Bukhari. History Early rulers Delhi Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq appointed Malik Mufarrah, also known as Farhat-ul-Mulk and Rasti Khan governor of Gujarat in 1377. In 1387, Sikandar Khan was sent to replace him, but he was defeated and killed by Farhat-ul-Mulk. In 1391, Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Muhammad bin Tughluq appointed Zafar Khan, the son of Wajih-ul-Mulk as governor of Gujarat and conferred him the title of Muzaffar Khan (r. 1391 - 1403, 1404 - 1411). In 1392, he defeated Farhat-ul-Mulk in the battle of Kamboi, near Anhilwada Patan and occupied the city of Anhilwada Patan.Majumdar, R.C. (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp. 155-7 In 1403, Zafar Khan's son Tatar Khan urged his father to march on Delhi, which he declined. As a result, in 1408, Tatar imprisoned him in Ashawal (future Ahmedabad) and declared himself sultan under the title of Muhammad Shah I (r. 1403 - 1404). He marched towards Delhi, but on the way he was poisoned by his uncle, Shams Khan. After the death of Muhammad Shah, Muzaffar was released from the prison and he took over the control over administration. In 1407, he declared himself as Sultan Muzaffar Shah I, took the insignia of royalty and issued coins in his name. After his death in 1411, he was succeeded by his grandson, the son of Tatar Khan, Ahmad Shah I. Ahmad Shah I Soon after his accession, Ahmad Shah I was faced with a rebellion of his uncles. The rebellion was led by his eldest uncle Firuz Khan, who declared himself king. Ultimately Firuz and his brothers surrendered to him. During this rebellion Sultan Hushang Shah of Malwa Sultanate invaded Gujarat. He was repelled this time but he invaded again in 1417 along with Nasir Khan, the Farooqi dynasty ruler of Khandesh and occupied Sultanpur and Nandurbar. Gujarat army defeated them and later Ahmad Shah led four expeditions into Malwa in 1419, 1420, 1422 and 1438.Majumdar, R.C. (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp. 157-60 In 1429, Kanha Raja of Jhalawad with the help of the Bahmani Sultan Ahmad Shah ravaged Nandurbar. But Ahmad Shah's army defeated the Bahmani army and they fled to Daulatabad. The Bahmani Sultan Ahmad Shah sent strong reinforcements and the Khandesh army also joined them. They were again defeated by the Gujarat army. Finally, Ahmad Shah annexed Thana and Mahim from Bahmani Sultanate. At the beginning of his reign, he founded the city of Ahmedabad which he styled as Shahr-i-Mu'azzam (the great city) on the banks of Sabarmati River. He shifted the capital from Anhilwada Patan to Ahmedabad. The Jami Masjid (1423) in Ahmedabad were built during his reign.Majumdar, R.C. (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp. 709-23 Sultan Ahmad Shah died in 1443 and succeeded by his eldest son Muhammad Shah II. Successors of Ahmad Shah I Muhammad Shah II (r. 1442 - 1451) first led a campaign against Idar and forced its ruler, Raja Hari Rai or Bir Rai to submit to his authority. He then exacted tribute from the Rawal of Dungarpur. In 1449, he marched against Champaner, but the ruler of Champaner, Raja Kanak Das, with the help of Malwa Sultan Mahmud Khilji forced him to retreat. On the return journey, he fell seriously ill and died in February 1451. After his death, he was succeeded by his son Qutb-ud-Din Ahmad Shah II (r. 1451 - 1458).Majumdar, R.C. (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp. 160-1 Ahmad Shah II defeated Khilji at Kapadvanj. He helped Firuz Khan ruling from Nagaur against Rana Kumbha of Chittor's attempt to overthrow him. After death of Ahmad Shah II in 1458, the nobles raised his uncle Daud Khan, son of Ahmad Shah I, to the throne. Mahmud Begada But within a short period of seven or twenty-seven days, the nobles deposed Daud Khan and set on the throne Fath Khan, son of Muhammad Shah II. Fath Khan, on his accession, adopted the title Abu-al Fath Mahmud Shah, popularly known as Mahmud Begada. He expanded the kingdom in all directions. He received the sobriquet Begada, which literally means the conqueror of two forts, probably after conquering Girnar and Champaner forts. Mahmud died on 23 November 1511.Majumdar, R.C. (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp. 162-7 Muzaffar Shah II and his successors Khalil Khan, son of Mahmud Begada succeeded his father with the title Muzaffar Shah II. In 1519, Rana Sanga of Chittor defeated a joint army of Malwa and Gujarat sultanates and took Mahmud Shah II of Malwa captive. Muzaffar Shah sent an army to Malwa but their service was not required as Rana Sanga had generously restored Mahmud Shah II to the throne.However,Rana Sanga defeated Ibrahim Lodhi of Delhi at Battle of Dholpur around the same time and Conquered Much of Malwa along with Chanderi and he bestowed it to his Vassal Medini Rai who ruled over Malwa under his lordship with Chanderi as his capital.The victory brought Rajputs within day's march of Agra and Delhi and made them contender of supremacy of Northern India. Rana Sanga later invaded Gujarat and plundered the Sultanate's treasuries, greatly damaging its prestige, Sanga also annexed northern Gujarat and appointed one of his Rajput vassals to rule there. The invasion of Rana weakened Gujarat, however after Rana Sanga's death, the sultans of Gujarat freed their kingdom from Rajputs and grew even more powerful as they sacked Chittor fort in 1535. He died on 5 April 1526 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sikandar.Majumdar, R.C. (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp. 167-9 After few months, Sikandar Sh√°h was murdered by a noble Im√°d-ul-Mulk, who seated a younger brother of Sikandar, named N√°sir Kh√°n, on the throne with the title of Mahm√∫d Shah II and governed on his behalf. Other son of Muzaffar Shah II, Bhadur Khan returned from outside of Gujarat and the nobles joined him. Bah√°dur marched at once on Ch√°mp√°ner, captured and executed Im√°d-ul-Mulk and poisoning N√°sir Kh√°n ascended the throne in 1527 with the title of Bah√°dur Sh√°h. Bahadur Shah and his successors Bahadur Shah expanded his kingdom and made expeditions to help neighbouring kingdoms. In 1532, Gujarat came under attack of the Mughal Emperor Humayun and fell. Bahadur Shah regained the kingdom in 1536 but he was killed by the Portuguese on board the ship when making a deal with them. Bahadur had no son, hence there was some uncertainty regarding succession after his death. Muhammad Zaman Mirza, the fugitive Mughal prince made his claim on the ground that Bahadur's mother adopted him as her son. The nobles selected Bahadur's nephew Miran Muhammad Shah of Khandesh as his successor, but he died on his way to Gujarat. Finally, the nobles selected Mahmud Khan, the son of Bahadur's brother Latif Khan as his successor and he ascended to the throne as Mahmud Shah III in 1538.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007). The Mughul Empire, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , pp.391-8 Mahmud Shah III had to battle with his nobles who were interested in independence. He was killed in 1554 by his servant. Ahmad Shah III succeeded him but now the reigns of the state were controlled by the nobles who divided the kingdom between themselves. He was assassinated in 1561. He was succeeded by Muzaffar Shah III. Muzaffar Shah III Mughal Emperor Akbar annexed Gujarat in his empire in 1573 and Gujarat became a Mughal Subah (province). Muzaffar Shah III was taken prisoner to Agra. In 1583, he escaped from the prison and with the help of the nobles succeeded to regain the throne for a short period before being defeated by Akbar's general Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana in January 1584. He fled and finally took asylum under Jam Sataji of Nawanagar State. The Battle of Bhuchar Mori was fought between the Mughal forces led by Mirza Aziz Koka and the combined Kathiawar forces in 1591 to protect him. He finally committed suicide when he was surrendered to the Mughal. List of rulers Administration Gujar√°t was divided politically into two main parts; one, called the kh√°lsah or crown domain administered directly by the central authority; the other, on payment of tribute in service or in money, left under the control of its former rulers. The amount of tribute paid by the different chiefs depended, not on the value of their territory, but on the terms granted to them when they agreed to become feudatories of the king. This tribute was occasionally collected by military expeditions headed by the king in person and called mulkg√≠ri or country-seizing circuits. The internal management of the feudatory states was unaffected by their payment of tribute. Justice was administered and the revenue collected in the same way as under the Chaulukya kings. The revenue consisted, as before, of a share of the crops received in kind, supplemented by the levy of special cesses, trade, and transit dues. The chief's share of the crops differed according to the locality; it rarely exceeded one-third of the produce, it rarely fell short of one-sixth. From some parts the chief's share was realised directly from the cultivator by agents called mantris; from other parts the collection was through superior landowners. ;Districts and crown lands The √Åhmed√°b√°d kings divided the portion of their territory which was under their direct authority into districts or sark√°rs. These districts were administered in one of two ways. They were either assigned to nobles in support of a contingent of troops, or they were set apart as crown domains and managed by paid officers. The officers placed in charge of districts set apart as crown domains were called muktiƒÉ. Their chief duties were to preserve the peace and to collect the revenue. For the maintenance of order, a body of soldiers from the army headquarters at √Åhmed√°b√°d was detached for service in each of these divisions, and placed under the command of the district governor. At the same time, in addition to the presence of this detachment of regular troops, every district contained certain fortified outposts called th√°n√°s, varying in number according to the character of the country and the temper of the people. These posts were in charge of officers called th√°nad√°rs subordinate to the district governor. They were garrisoned by bodies of local soldiery, for whose maintenance, in addition to money payments, a small assignment of land was set apart in the neighbourhood of the post. On the arrival of the tribute-collecting army the governors of the districts through which it passed were expected to join the main body with their local contingents. At other times the district governors had little control over the feudatory chiefs in the neighbourhood of their charge. The Gujarat Sultanate had comprised twenty-five sarkars (administrative units). ;Fiscal For fiscal purposes each district or sark√°r was distributed among a certain number of sub-divisions or pargan√°hs, each under a paid official styled √°mil or tahsild√°r. These sub-divisional officers realised the state demand, nominally one-half of the produce, by the help of the headmen of the villages under their charge. In the sharehold and simple villages of North Gujar√°t these village headmen were styled Patels or according to Muslim writers mukaddams and in the simple villages of the south they were known as Desais. They arranged for the final distribution of the total demand in joint villages among the shareholders, and in simple villages from the individual cultivators. The sub-divisional officer presented a statement of the accounts of the villages in his sub-division to the district officer, whose record of the revenue of his whole district was in turn forwarded to the head revenue officer at court. As a check on the internal management of his charge, and especially to help him in the work of collecting the revenue, with each district governor was associated an accountant. Further that each of these officers might be the greater check on the other, Ahmad Shah I enforced the rule that when the governor was chosen from among the royal slaves the accountant should be a free man, and that when the accountant was a slave the district governor should be chosen from some other class. This practise was maintained till the end of the reign of Muzaffar Sh√°h II, when, according to the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi, the army became much increased, and the ministers, condensing the details of revenue, farmed it on contract, so that many parts formerly yielding one rupee now produced ten, and many others seven eight or nine, and in no place was there a less increase than from ten to twenty per cent. Many other changes occurred at the same time, and the spirit of innovation creeping into the administration the wholesome system of checking the accounts was given up and mutiny and confusion spread over Gujar√°t. Sources of history Mirat-i-Sikandari is a Persian work on the complete history of Gujarat Sultanate written by Sikandar, son of Muhammad aka Manjhu, son of Akbar who wrote it soon after Akbar conquered Gujarat. He had consulted earlier works of history and the people of authority. Other Persian works of the history of Gujarat Sultanate are Tarikh-i-Muzaffar Shahi about reign of Muzaffar Shah I, Tarik-i-Ahmad Shah in verse by Hulvi Shirazi, Tarikh-i-Mahmud Shahi, Tabaqat-i-Mahmud Shahi, Maathi-i-Mahmud Shahi about Mahmud I, Tarikh-i-Muzaffar Shahi about Muzaffar Shah II's conquest of Mandu, Tarikh-i-Bahadur Shahi aka Tabaqat-i-Husam Khani, Tarikh-i-Gujarat by Abu Turab Vali, Mirat-i-Ahmadi. Other important work in Arabic about history of Gujarat includes Zafarul-Walih bi Muzaffar wa Alih by Hajji Dabir. Architecture During the Muzaffarid rule, Ahmedabad grew to become one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the world, and the sultans were patrons of a distinctive architecture that blended Islamic elements with Gujarat's indigenous Hindu and Jain architectural traditions. Gujarat's Islamic architecture presages many of the architectural elements later found in Mughal architecture, including ornate mihrabs and minarets, jali (perforated screens carved in stone), and chattris (pavilions topped with cupolas).
