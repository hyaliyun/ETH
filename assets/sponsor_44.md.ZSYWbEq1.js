He was captured and executed in 1942 in Valjevo. A photo of him taken shortly before his execution became a symbol of resistance against fascism in the Second World War, and was, among others, exhibited in the United Nations building in New York. He was proclaimed People's Hero of Yugoslavia in 1949. Biography Monument to Filipoviƒá in Valjevo Stjepan Filipoviƒá was born on 27 January 1916 in Opuzen (modern-day Croatia) as the fifth child of Anton and Ivka Filipoviƒá. He is of Croat origin. The Filipoviƒá family moved throughout the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, so he lived in ≈Ωupanja, Mostar and Kragujevac. In Kragujevac, he studied locksmithing and mastered the basics of electrical wiring, carpentry and bookbinding. He joined the labour movement in 1937, but he was arrested in 1939 and sentenced to a year in prison. He joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1940. Filipoviƒá was commander of the Partisans' Tamnavsko-Kolubarski unit in Valjevo (modern-day Serbia) by 1941. He was captured on 24 December 1941 by Chetniks unit of Kosta Peƒáanac and hanged in Valjevo by Serbian State Guard unit on 27 May 1942, aged 26. As the rope was put around his neck, Filipoviƒá raised his arms and shouted \\"Smrt fa≈°izmu, sloboda narodu!\\" (\\"Death to fascism, freedom to the people!\\"). He urged the Yugoslav people to resist and implored them to never cease resisting. A photograph taken at this moment was widely reproduced and became a symbol of anti-fascist resistance. A statue of Filipoviƒá was cast in its likeness. Filipoviƒá was declared a National Hero of Yugoslavia on 14 December 1949. The town of Valjevo has a statue dedicated to him, \\"Stevan Filipoviƒá\\". A monument was also erected in his home town of Opuzen in 1968, but was demolished in 1991. His brother ≈†imun was shot by Germans in the Kragujevac massacre. Although he was an ethnic Croat, which could have saved him from death, he refused to say so, and he shared his fate with citizens of Kragujevac. Stjepan's second brother Nikola was killed in May 1943 as a member of the 1st Proletarian Brigade. References External links *Narodni heroji Jugoslavije, Mladost, Belgrade, 1975.

Based in Houma, Louisiana, the band was fronted by Dax Riggs (formerly of Acid Bath and Agents of Oblivion). After disputes with an independent label over the distribution of their debut album If This Is Hell, Then I'm Lucky, the band signed a three-record deal with Fat Possum. For the latter part of 2005, and most of 2006, they toured in support of their major label debut, We Are Night Sky, playing from bars and smaller venues to Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, and Bonnaroo. In early 2006, Riggs recruited his former Agents of Oblivion bandmate, Alex Bergeron, to play bass on tour. Later that year, the band was primarily a duo of Riggs and Tess Brunet. This line-up was often compared to The White Stripes in reviews, and their music is sometimes referred to as \\"swamp rock.\\" By 2007, Brunet left the band and Riggs went on to a solo career. In 2015, their track \\"Stop, I\`m Already Dead\\" became the theme song for the CW television series, iZombie. Background Deadboy & the Elephantmen first appeared in late 2000, following in the wake of the break-up of Agents of Oblivion. The band was created by two former Agents of Oblivion members, Dax Riggs (Acid Bath, Agents Of Oblivion) and Chuck Pitre (Gawk Solie, Goggle Eye, Psycho Kitty, Agents of Oblivion). By early 2001, they had expanded to a full line-up. Members included Chuck Pitre Piano, Keyboards, Jason Dupre on the guitar, Christopher T. Gautreaux on the bass, and Jeff LeCompte on the drums, and Niki Rhodes Jr. on the guitar. A rare, 8-song CD was released in late 2000 called \\"the 8 song demo\\". Shortly after, the two main composers Niki and Chuck (producer, composer and arranger) left the band. Deadboy's first label-backed album, If This Is Hell, Then I'm Lucky was released in 2002. The album was discontinued and for a time was extremely hard to find. However, it has recently been re-released by Rotten Records and Fat Possum. Fat Possum's re-issue altered the artwork, spine and disc to say Dax Riggs instead of Deadboy and The Elephantmen. Rotten's re-issue kept the original art intact. Following the first album, several band members quit, so Dax Riggs sought new musicians. The line-up for the first album consisted of Jason Dupre on the guitar, Christopher T. Gautreaux on the bass, and Jeff LeCompte on the drums. Niki Rhodes Jr. then rejoined the project and Christopher (Saxophone and Keyboard) began working with him on futuristic techno rock. Other musicians were then brought in after Christopher and Niki left the group, and New York City-based Nasty Little Man handled the band's live promotions. It was during this time that Brunet was recruited and the two began recording. An EP, Song Mechanism, was released in late 2004. It was distributed by Riggs through Deadboy's website and various local Louisiana music stores. It too has been discontinued though all four tracks from the EP later appeared on We Are Night Sky. We Are Night Sky was made available for purchase online in late 2005, but its official release date was February 7, 2006. While it is technically the second full-length album for Deadboy & The Elephantmen, it is the first featuring the simpler two-person lineup and is better distributed than previous efforts, and as such is often referred to as their 'debut' album. Upon discovering We Are Night Sky, Henry Rollins began championing the band on his radio show Harmony in My Head and his TV show The Henry Rollins Show. He has since had the band on the latter to perform \\"Stop, I'm Already Dead\\". In late 2006, Brunet left the band, but it has yet to be stated why and under what terms. On April 16, 2007 it was announced that the band was no more, and further records will be released under Dax Riggs' own name.

Delgado, starring Cantinflas, √Ångel Garasa and Rosa Mar√≠a V√°zquez.Garc√≠a Riera, p. 35 Plot The young priest Father Sebasti√°n (played by Cantinflas) is assigned to a parish in San Jer√≥nimo el Alto, where he is not welcomed by the community, particularly the resident priest Father Dami√°n (played by √Ångel Garasa). The newcomer gradually earns the trust of the people through humor, but firmly captures their hearts by saving the town fiesta by fighting a bull when the hired torero failed to show. Father Sebasti√°n counsels the townspeople, lecturing them on their duties in a modern society. He used the collection plate to redistribute the town's wealth more evenly. When accused of communism, he quoted the 1891 socially conscious encyclical Rerum novarum. He even ventured into politics, with a veiled attack on the municipal president couched into a sermon. Eventually, he brokers a deal with the local political boss for some concessions for the poor of his parish.

However, some found the religious themes indicative of the spirit of Latin American Catholicism. Pope John XXIII called the Second Vatican Council only two years earlier, and Cantinflas seemed to be embracing the reforms it espoused as the remedy for Mexico's poverty. Some accused Cantinflas of mocking the faith and the priesthood, but he assured his audience that his \\"message would be only positive, constructive, happy, human, Christian.\\" The Latin American contingent of seminarians in Rome apparently shared his assessment, and wrote him a grateful letter. Some Cantinflas biographers, however, saw political overtones in the film. The book Filmhistoria claims that in the film Cantinflas implicitly helped Mexico's then-ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), stating that when the PRI was \\"threatened by the growing numbers of impoverished Mexicans\\", Cantinflas \\"intervened in the current social debate through his film\\", noting that, while his character was initially presented \\"in the reformist spirit of the Second Vatican Council\\", in the end he \\"gives his approval to closed-door political machinations, winning concessions from the boss [Don Silvestre] by cutting a deck of cards, rather than by leading the people to liberate themselves.\\"Filmhistoria, p. 199‚Äì200 In Looking for Mexico: Modern Visual Culture and National Identity, John Mraz stated that \\"under the guise of being nonideological\\", in the film Cantinflas \\"openly encouraged an antipolitical solution to Mexico's problems, suggesting [...] that entering into politics is a cardinal sin.\\"Mraz, p. 128 References Bibliography *Garc√≠a Riera, Emilio.

The Junta Organizadora (1910)The Mexican Liberal Party (PLM; ) was started in August 1900 when Ingeniero Camilo Arriaga published a manifesto entitled Invitacion al Partido Liberal (Invitation to the Liberal Party). The invitation was addressed to Mexican liberals who were dissatisfied with the way the Porfirio D√≠az government was deviating from the liberal Constitution of 1857.Ward Albro, \\"Always a Rebel\\" 1992, p8 Arriaga called on Mexican liberals to form local liberal clubs, which would then send delegates to a liberal convention.Ward Albro, \\"Always a Rebel\\" 1992, p10 The first Mexican Liberal Party Convention was held in San Luis Potos√≠ in February 1901. Fifty local clubs from thirteen states sent 56 delegates.Ward Albro, \\"Always a Rebel\\" 1992, p10 The Convention delegates affirmed their liberal beliefs in free speech, free press, and free assembly. They objected to the close workings of the Diaz government and the Catholic Church.Ward Albro, \\"Always a Rebel\\" 1992, p8 The convention produced fifty-one resolutions which called for the organization of the new Liberal Party, propagation of liberal principles, development of means to combat the political influence of the clergy, establishment of means to improve the administration of justice, proposals calling for guarantees of the rights of citizens and real freedom of the press, and proposals favoring complete self-government at the local level. They also called for support for free secular education in the primary schools, the spread of liberal ideas among the lower classes, the establishment of liberal publications, and the taxation of Church income.Ward Albro, \\"Always a Rebel\\" 1992, p13 Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n attended the first Convention as a reporter for his newspaper Regeneraci√≥n (\\"Regeneration\\"). He afterwards published an editorial in favorable support of the aims and aspirations. In April 1901, the new Mexican Liberal Party opened a branch in Mexico City, and Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n and his brothers joined and became active members. Always a bit more radical than most members, Flores Mag√≥n was forced into exile in January 1904. Finally settling in San Antonio, Texas, Flores Mag√≥n called for radical members of the Liberal Party to follow him in a new organization. In September 1905, the radical liberals, led by Flores Mag√≥n, formed a new organization called Junta Organizadora del Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM). This organization would be separate from the Liberal Party, and it would seek to coordinate the violent overthrow of the D√≠az government.Ward Albro, \\"Always a Rebel\\" 1992, p30 The MLP was involved in strikes and uprisings in Mexico from 1906 to 1911. Overview The party controlled the northern part of Baja California in 1911, including Tijuana, Mexicali, and Tecate. In August 1911 part of the MLP militants, including Juan Sarabia, Jes√∫s Flores Mag√≥n and Antonio D√≠az Soto y Gama split from the organization and transformed into the \\"Liberal Party\\" (). John Lear - Workers, Neighbors, and Citizens: The Revolution in Mexico City. Political cultures and movilization - Maderista politics The MLP was supported from exile in Texas by the feminist writer Andrea Villarreal. Background In February 1901, the Liberal Congress was founded in San Luis Potos√≠, in which representatives of fourteen states of the Mexican Republic demanded to dismiss the postulates of the Constitution of 1857. Dozens of liberal clubs were created throughout the country and an attempt was made to establish a \\"Confederation of Liberal Circles\\", but the following year its founders were arrested. Porfirio D√≠az severely repressed the entire opposition and in 1902 he was re-elected as president of Mexico for the third time. By 1904 the police persecution of the Diaz government, its political opponents were forced to seek refuge abroad, coupled with the growing political differences between the liberals, a group headed by Camilo Arriaga, went into exile in San Antonio, Texas, and another, headed by Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, in the border city of Laredo. Diaz agents backed by US authorities chased liberals in Texas, so they continued to move further and further north. On 28 September 1905, in Saint Louis, Missouri, United States, the Mag√≥n Flores group drafted the manifesto with which the Organizing Board of the Mexican Liberal Party was constituted. The tasks of the Organizing Board were to summon and articulate all the opposing forces to prepare the fight against the dictator. Example of Regerati√≥n, the publication of the PLM, 1906. On 1 July 1906, after almost a year of discussion on the political, economic and social situation of the country, the Manifesto and Program of the Mexican Liberal Party was published. Among the main policies of the program were the eight-hour day, prohibition of child labor, minimum wage, compensation for accidents at work, compulsory and free secular education. Years later, these policies presented by the PLM in this program formed the basis of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico, which officially ended the Mexican Revolution. Strikes and Insurrections The PLM organized several uprisings against the Porfirio D√≠az regime, all of which were violently repressed. The PLM Program influenced the Cananea strike, and R√≠o Blanco strike, as well as the Acayucan rebellion. On 16 September, the PLM initiated their revolutionary plan. When the groups operating in the United States took over the main border customs and reinforced the supply of weapons, the 44 guerilla groups (totalling 2200 fighters) all over the republic would rise up in arms. However most of the liberals were discovered by the US police, who seized weapons and documents that discovered the insurrection plans, so it had to be postponed. 26 September was set as the new date to start the Revolution. A group of liberals attacked Jim√©nez but after a few hours federal forces arrived, outnumbering and forcing them to flee. Other attacks were carried out in Monclova, Zaragoza, Piedras Negras and other small towns in Coahuila, to similar results. On 30 September, the Acayucan rebellion began, led by Hilario C. Salas and C√°ndido Donato Padua, PLM delegates from Veracruz and Tabasco. In Acayucan the clashes against the army lasted 4 days. Most of the rebels died, some fled to the Soteapan mountain range where they reorganized the guerrilla war, continuing the fight until 1911. On 16 October, a third insurrectional attempt was made in Camargo, which was also defeated. On 19 October, the group from El Paso, organized by Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, ventured into Ciudad Juarez, but were discovered crossing the border by federal soldiers, who were already aware of the uprising. The next day the rest of the insurgents were arrested in El Paso by immigration agents and Pinkerton detectives, but Mag√≥n managed to escape. On 24 June 1908 the PLM attacked Viesca, but were repelled and defeated. The leaders were apprehended and sent to the political prison of San Juan de Ul√∫a in Veracruz. On 26 June, the liberals attacked Acu√±a, Casas Grandes and Palomas. There was also belligerent PLM activity in Oaxaca, Puebla, Tlaxcala and Morelos. The railroad strike that paralyzed the northern part of the country that year was also influenced by the PLM. A Pinkerton agent in St. Louis declared that, in 1908, 180 members of the PLM had been arrested and placed in Mexican prisons, so \\"the danger of a revolution had passed\\".Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n: una vida en rebeld√≠a, Salvador Hern√°ndez Padilla, September 2003 But in 1909, Pr√°xedis G. Guerrero published a series of manifestos aimed at the workers of the world, and urged Mexicans to rise up in rebellion. The most effective weapon of the PLM was the press. Even in exile, it had at least 7 publications in different locations, all of which were gradually suppressed by the authorities. p. 146. The Mexican Libertarian Army Soldiers of the Libertarian Army during the Baja Revolution, 1911. For the Mexican Liberal Party, simply overthrowing dictator Porfirio D√≠az wasn't enough if it did not guarantee communal freedom. They understood that the struggle for political freedom was useless if economic freedom didn't come with it, so in order to guarantee that freedom it would be necessary to take and defend the land in an armed rebellion. The armed groups of the PLM were organized into the Liberal Army Confederation, also known as the Mexican Libertarian Army. On 23 September 1911, the PLM Organizing Board in Los Angeles published, in Regeneration, a libertarian manifesto that called on Mexicans to fight against the State, the Clergy and Capital, under the slogan \\"Land and Freedom\\", an ideal that a month later was taken up by Emiliano Zapata. The most important military campaign of the Mexican Liberal Army was the Baja Revolution. Mexicans and volunteers of other nationalities participated in this anarchist and socialist revolution; reason that gave rise to the authorities intensifying their repression of the PLM. By refusing to recognize the Treaties of Ciudad Ju√°rez, the PLM guerrillas were persecuted and exterminated by the federal army and Maderist groups during the provisional government of Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra, who requested support from the United States government to transfer Mexican troops through American territory and attack the Baja revolution on two fronts. The military campaigns of the PLM, failed again and again due to the lack of resources, police infiltration and confusion caused by counterproductive tactics. Although for some, Maderism represented the most viable political alternative; for others, supporting Madero was simply the only way to escape alive from Mexican prisons. However, there were others who preferred jail or death to betraying their ideals. p. 193-194. Final years After the raid on Baja California, and with Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, Librado Rivera and Anselmo Figueroa in jail, there were other armed uprisings on behalf of the PLM. Such was the case of Primitivo Guti√©rrez who on 9 February 1912, on behalf of the PLM, repealed the Constitution and declared anarchist communism in the town of Las Vacas, Coahuila.Regeneraci√≥n Tomo IV, No. 77. Los √Ångeles, California.17 de febrero de 1912. Archivo Electr√≥nico Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n. In 1913 PLM groups attempted to launch themselves back into the armed struggle. While attempting to enter Mexico from Texas, they faced a group of rangers, were defeated and sentenced to 50 years or more of prison.This group of condemned PLM members were known as \\"The Martyrs of Texas.\\" Notes on a letter from Flores Mag√≥n to lawyer Harry Weinberger, defender of Flores Mag√≥n and the Martyrs of Texas. Kansas, 1920. Upon his return to Mexico, Librado Rivera wrote the book \\"Los Martires de Texas\\", in favor of the freedom of his fellow prisoners. However, these actions had no major impact on the development of events in Mexico, the PLM's role in the Mexican Revolution drew to a close. In 1915, after the death of Anselmo L. Figueroa and the lack of resources to continue Regeneration, a small group of the PLM moved to a farm located in Edendale, Los Angeles. There they lived and worked communally, raised chickens and grew vegetables that they sold for support, while carrying out the political work of the PLM, now renamed the Revolutionary Workers Union (UOR).Hern√°ndez Padilla, Salvador. op. cit., p. 197. In February 1916, Enrique and Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n were arrested at their home in Edendale, accused of defaming Venustiano Carranza. They were released months later, when a committee promoted by Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman collected the bail money demanded by the Los Angeles court. Shortly after leaving prison, Enrique Flores Mag√≥n left the UOR, along with most others. Librado Rivera and Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n remained, and together they published a manifesto in Regeneration addressed to anarchists of the world. In 1918, they were arrested, accused of conspiracy by the United States government, and sentenced to 15 and 20 years in prison respectively. Flores Mag√≥n died in prison in 1922. Rivera was released and deported to Mexico where he continued denouncing the governments emanating from the revolution, he was imprisoned during the mandate of Plutarco El√≠as Calles and died in 1932.

Discovery According to Andrew Balsa, around the time of the discovery of the F00F bug on Intel Pentium, Serguei Shtyliov from Moscow found a flaw in a Cyrix processor while developing an IDE disk driver in assembly language. Alexandr Konosevich, from Omsk, further researched the bug and coauthored an article with Uwe Post in the German technology magazine c't, calling it the \\"hidden CLI bug\\" (CLI is the instruction that disables interrupts in the x86 architecture). Balsa, as a member on the Linux-kernel mailing list, confirmed that the following C program (which uses inline x86-specific assembly language) could be compiled and run by an unprivileged user: unsigned char c[4] = {0x36, 0x78, 0x38, 0x36}; int main() { asm ( \\" movl $c, %ebx \\" \\"again: xchgl (%ebx), %eax \\" \\" movl %eax, %edx \\" \\" jmp again \\" ); } Execution of this program renders the processor completely useless until it is rebooted, as it enters an infinite loop that cannot be interrupted. This allows any user with access to a Cyrix system with this bug to perform a denial-of-service attack. It is similar to execution of a Halt and Catch Fire instruction, although the coma bug is not any one particular instruction. Analysis What causes the bug is not an interrupt mask, nor are interrupts being explicitly disabled. Instead, an anomaly in the Cyrix's instruction pipeline prevents interrupts from being serviced for the duration of the loop; since the loop never ends, interrupts will never be serviced. The xchgxchgl in the source code means Exchange (Long) instruction is atomic, meaning that other instructions are not allowed to change the state of the system while it is executed. In order to ensure this atomicity, the designers at Cyrix made the xchg uninterruptible. Due to pipelining and branch predicting, however, another xchg enters the pipeline before the previous one completes, causing a deadlock. Workarounds A fix for unintentional instances of the bug is to insert another instruction in the loop, the nop instruction being a good candidate. Cyrix suggested serializing the xchg opcode, thus bypassing the pipeline. However, these techniques will not serve to prevent deliberate attacks. One way to prevent this bug is to enable bit 0x10 in the configuration register CCR1. This disables implicit bus locking normally done by xchg instruction. Since CPUs affected by this bug were not designed to work in multi-processor systems, loss of xchg atomicity is harmless.

As such, it could be a sociological term, but was actually coined by Alan Rayner and Norman Todd working at Exeter University in the late 1970s, to characterise a particular kind of zone line formed between wood-rotting fungal mycelia. Intraspecific antagonism is one of the expressions of a phenomenon known as vegetative or somatic incompatibility. Fungal individualism Zone lines form in wood for many reasons, including host reactions against parasitic encroachment, and inter-specific interactions, but the lines observed by Rayner and Todd when transversely-cut sections of brown-rotted birch tree trunk or branch were incubated in plastic bags appeared to be due to a reaction between different individuals of the same species of fungus. This was a startling inference at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy within the mycological community was that of the \\"unit mycelium\\". This was the theory that when two different individuals of the same species of basidiomycete wood rotting fungi grew and met within the substratum, they fused, cooperated, and shared nuclei freely. Rayner and Todd's insight was that basidiomycete fungi individuals do, in most \\"adult\\" or dikaryotic cases anyway, retain their individuality. A small stable of postgraduate and postdoctoral students helped elucidate the mechanisms underlying these intermycelial interactions, at Exeter University (Todd) and the University of Bath (Rayner), over the next few years. Applications of intraspecific antagonism Zone lines in driftwood Although the attribution of individual status to the mycelia confined by intraspecific zone lines is a comparatively new idea, zone lines themselves have been known since time immemorial. The term spalting is applied by woodworkers to wood showing strongly-figured zone lines, particularly those cases where the area of \\"no- man's land\\" between two antagonistic conspecific mycelia is colonised by another species of fungus. Dematiaceous hyphomycetes, with their dark-coloured mycelia, produce particularly attractive black zone lines when they colonise the areas occupied by two antagonistic basidiomycete individuals. Spalted wood can be difficult to work, since different individual wood-rotting fungi have different decay efficiencies, and thus produce zones of different softness, and the zone lines themselves are usually unrotted and hard. Instraspecific antagonism can also sometimes be of assistance in quickly recognising the membership of clones in those fungi, particularly root-rots such as Armillarea where individual mycelia may colonise large areas, or more than one tree. It is even the subject of a recent patent.

The term SGL usually has broad, important and positive personal, social, and political purposes and consequences. SGL has been described as \\"an anti-hate and anti-anti-Black identity [...] movement, philosophy and framework\\".

Personal life Mountjoy was born in Los Angeles, California and graduated from Monrovia-Arcadia-Duarte High School in 1950. He joined the US Navy and served oversea during the Korean War. After his navy service he worked briefly as an auto mechanic. Then did construction work with his brother Gordon, the two later started the Mountjoy Construction Company. He was married to Earline Winnett until her death in 2009. He has two sons, Michael and Dennis Lee, and one daughter, Judy. Dennis was a member of the California State Assembly, having represented his father's old district from 2000 to 2006. Dick is Life Member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Political career Mountjoy served as the mayor of Monrovia from 1968 to 1976. He served in the California State Assembly from 1978 to 1995 from the California's 59th State Assembly district. From 1982 to 1984 he served as the California Assembly Republican Caucus Chair. While there he introduced California Proposition 187, which denied government services to illegal immigrants. He served in the California State Senate from 1995 to 2000 in the California's 29th State Senate district. His political platform fit with that of the conservative wing of the Republican Party: he was anti-abortion, opposed same-sex marriage, and supported both the war in Iraq and possible military intervention in Iran. On September 22, 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported that a statement in his website's biography, that he served in the Korean War aboard the USS Missouri, was incorrect; ship records later confirmed that he actually served aboard the USS Bremerton. Mountjoy said, \\"I think it was just something that somebody picked up, it didn‚Äôt come from me.\\" However, Feinstein's campaign opined that the error raised enough doubts about Mountjoy‚Äôs credibility that Mountjoy was \\"not qualified to serve the people of California.\\" Mountjoy was defeated by incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein by a wide margin (59-35 percent) in the general election held on November 7, 2006.

Designed by Modjeski & Masters and completed in 1960, it has 6 spans and a main span of totaling across the Saint Lawrence River and Saint Lawrence Seaway. The bridge is owned and operated by the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority, which also owns and operates Ogdensburg International Airport, the Port of Ogdensburg- Marine Terminal Facility, Commerce Park, the Port of Waddington, a medium- heavy industrial park and two short line railroads. The Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority is a New York State public-benefit corporation.  Accessibility  The Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge allows for both passenger and commercial vehicles to cross the Canada-United States border; neither cyclists nor pedestrians are permitted to cross this bridge. The bridge is a very popular border crossing for passenger vehicles due to its proximity to Ottawa on the Canadian side, with 410,000 vehicles crossing in 2011 alone. The bridge was designed for heavy loads and has a weight capacity of 105,000 pounds. The weight limit easily accommodates semi-trailer trucks. This bridge, however, does not see as much commercial traffic as the nearby Thousand Islands Bridge, as it is not a direct route to any American interstate highway. On the Canadian side, the bridge connects to Highway 16, a highway which interchanges with Highway 401 and Highway 416 that continues north to Ottawa. On the American side, the bridge connects to New York State Route 812, which connects with New York State Route 37 a few blocks from the southern end. Route 812 joins Route 37 west into Ogdensburg. It then goes south to Village of Lowville in Lewis County. Route 37 continues west to a fork at Morristown, N.Y. where Route 12 picks up to Alexandria Bay and Interstate 81. Border crossing The Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott Border Crossing connects the cities of Ogdensburg, New York and Johnstown, Ontario at the Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge. The US border inspection station was built in 1960. The inspection canopy was replaced, and the building significantly upgraded and expanded in 2004. The Canada border station was replaced in 2012. Events  On 1 September 2015, the Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge made headlines after Prime Minister Stephen Harper posted a video to his Facebook page standing in front of the bridge and the Port of Johnstown. The video was supposed to be a congratulatory video about the shipbuilding industry in the Halifax harbour in Halifax, Nova Scotia, however upon its release, locals of Halifax noticed inconsistencies with the scenery compared to that of the Halifax harbour and began to question where the video was actually shot. By 5 September, viewers had determined the video was actually shot in Johnstown, Ontario based on the quick shot of the port in the background, which was unmistakably the Port of Johnstown. Viewers then accused Harper of trying to pass off the scenery as the Halifax harbour due to the undeniable similarities between the Ogdensburg-Prescott bridge and the A. Murray MacKay Bridge in the Halifax harbour.

Other issues such as the question of abortion and homosexuality are viewed as important but over- emphasized by both liberals and conservatives. According to Campolo, \\"The purpose of this gathering was not to create a religious left movement to challenge the religious right, but to jump-start a religious movement that will transcend partisan politics.\\" Campolo has released a book to help explain this, called Red Letter Christians, A Citizen's Guide to Faith and Politics (Regal Books, February 2008).

It is named for the sharp hard plate on its lower jaw, which is used to scrape rocks for algae. It is the sole member of the monotypic genus Acrocheilus and is a close relative of the Gila western chubs.Simons & Mayden 1997  Description  The chiselmouth's body plan generally follows the standard cyprinid form, generally elongated and slightly compressed. The snout is very blunt, with the lower jaw's plate (which consists of cornified epithelium) jutting out slightly. Coloration is rather drab, dark brown above and lighter lower down. Many individuals also have a pattern of black dots, and younger fish may have a dark area at the base of the tail. The single dorsal fin has 10 soft rays, while the anal fin and well-developed pelvic fins each have 9-10 rays. Chiselmouths can reach a length of 30 cm (12 in).  Distribution and habitat  Chiselmouths are typically found in warmer parts of streams and rivers in the drainages of the Columbia River, Fraser River, and the Harney-Malheur system of the Great Basin. Some are found in lakes, migrating into streams to spawn. Although abundant in many parts of their range, behavior remains little-known. Chiselmouth were among the fishes typically utilized by the Nez Perce people as food.  Diet  Young fish feed on surface insects. When the chisel develops (at around 0.6 inches length), they shift to scraping, making short darting movements at the substrate to dislodge whatever is on it, and sucking it in. Although they consume filamentous algae, it seems to not be digested much despite a long coiled intestine, and their primary food actually consists of diatoms.

It was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1905. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog washerwoman who lives in a tiny cottage in the fells of the Lake District. A human child named Lucie happens upon the cottage and stays for tea. The two deliver freshly laundered clothing to the animals and birds in the neighbourhood. Potter thought the book would be best enjoyed by girls, and, like most girls' books of the period, it is set indoors with a focus on housework. Potter's pet hedgehog, Mrs. Tiggy-winkle,Potter spelled the name 'Tiggy-winkle' but the name in the title of the published book became 'Tiggy-Winkle' (Lear 2007, p. 187). and Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman, were the inspirations for the eponymous heroine. Lucie Carr, a child friend of Potter's, was the model for the fictional Lucie. Potter's Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny make cameo appearances in the illustrations. The Newlands Valley and the surrounding fells are the sources for the backgrounds in the illustrations. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle has been described as one of Potter's most positive creations,Taylor 1987, p. 121 but critics consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching back to an age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside and its way of life. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle became a popular character and the subject of considerable merchandise over the decades including nursery ware and porcelain figurines. The tale has been published in braille and the Initial Teaching Alphabet, and has been translated into French, German, and Dutch. In 1971, Mrs. Tiggy-winkle became a character performed by Sir Frederick Ashton in the Royal Ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter. In 1993, the tale was adapted to animation and telecast as an episode of the BBC series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends. In the world of Peter rabbit and friends the story was combined with the tale of Jeremy Fisher, the 7th book in the series. This book, the tale of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, is the 6th book in the series. It is also the 6th book to be published.  Plot  Mrs. Tiggy- winkle with Jenny Wren's wine-stained table cloth A little girl named Lucie lives on a farm called Little-town. She is a good little girl, but has lost three pocket handkerchiefs and a pinafore. She questions Tabby Kitten and Sally Henny-penny about them, but they know nothing (especially since Tabby Kitten licks her paw, and Sally Henny-penny flaps back into the barn clucking, \\"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\\" neither of which is very helpful). Lucie mounts a stile and spies some white cloths lying in the grass high on a hill behind the farm. She scrambles up the hill along a steep path-way which ends under a big rock. She finds a little door in the hillside, and hears someone singing behind it: :Lily-white and clean, oh! :With little frills between, oh! :Smooth and hot ‚Äì red rusty spot :Never here be seen, oh! She knocks. A frightened voice cries out, \\"Who's that?\\" Lucie opens the door, and discovers a low-ceilinged kitchen. Everything is tiny, even the pots and pans. At the table stands a short, stout person wearing a tucked-up print gown, an apron, and a striped petticoat. She is ironing. Her little black nose goes sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes go twinkle, twinkle, and beneath her little white cap are prickles! She is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, the animals' laundress and \\"an excellent clear-starcher\\". She keeps busy with her work. She has found Lucie's lost things, and launders them for her. She also shows Lucie items belonging to Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's animal customers. They have tea together, though Lucie keeps away from Mrs. Tiggy-winkle due to the prickles. Lucie enters Mrs Tiggy-winkle's cottage; Potter had trouble depicting humans The laundered clothing is tied up in bundles and Lucie's handkerchiefs are neatly folded into her clean pinafore. They set off together down the path to return the fresh laundry to the little animals and birds in the neighbourhood. At the bottom of the hill, Lucie mounts the stile and turns to thank Mrs. Tiggy- winkle. \\"But what a very odd thing!\\" Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is \\"running running running up the hill\\". Her cap, shawl, and print gown are nowhere to be seen. How small and brown she has grown ‚Äì and covered with prickles! \\"Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle [is] nothing but a HEDGEHOG!\\" The narrator tells the reader that some thought Lucie had fallen asleep on the stile and dreamed the encounter, but if so, then how could she have three clean handkerchiefs and a laundered pinafore? \\"Besides,\\" the narrator assures the reader, \\"I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells ‚Äì and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!\\"  Background  The story of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was inspired by Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman the Potters employed over the course of eleven summers at Dalguise House on the River Tay in Perthshire, writes Leslie Linder. Potter was 26 when, in 1892, she visited MacDonald while staying at Heath Park, Birnam. She wrote in her journal: \\"Went out with the pony ... to see Kitty MacDonald, our old washerwoman ... Kitty is eighty-three but waken, and delightfully merry ... She is a comical, round little woman, as brown as a berry and wears a multitude of petticoats and a white mutch. Her memory goes back for seventy years, and I really believe she is prepared to enumerate the articles of her first wash in the year '71\\". In 1942, the year before she died, Potter's thoughts returned to Kitty MacDonald when she wrote about a piece of crockery: > Seventy eighty years ago it belonged to another old woman, old Katie > MacDonald, the Highland washerwoman. She was a tiny body, brown as a berry, > beady black eyes and much wrinkled, against an incongruously white frilled > mutch. She wore a small plaid crossed over shawl pinned with a silver > brooch, a bed jacket, and a full kilted petticoat.

In 1902, it was put to paper. The Carr family lived at Skelghyl, but Potter took some artistic liberty and moved the house's location to Little Town in the text. The family came to tea at Lingholm often with Potter delighted by the one-year-child's behaviour. On one occasion, Lucie left her gloves behind at Lingholm, and Potter transformed the incident into the fictional Lucie's propensity for losing her pocket handkerchiefs.Lear 2007, p. 189 A small copy book contains what is believed to be the earliest manuscript of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Its title page is inscribed: \\"Made at Lingholm, Sept. 01 told to cousin Stephanie at Melford Nov. 01‚Äîwritten down Nov. 02. There are no pictures, it is a good one to tell‚Äî\\"Linder 1971, p. 155 Potter used her cousin's daughter, Stephanie Hyde Parker, as audience for the draft of the story. She likely meant to dedicate the book to Stephanie, writing in the manuscript, \\"Now Stephanie, this is a story about a little girl called Lucie; she was smaller than you and could not speak quite plain.\\". In the end however, the book was dedicated to Lucie Carr. Stephanie would receive the dedication to The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher in 1906. Early in 1904, Potter was putting the finishing touches on Benjamin Bunny and Two Bad Mice. At the same time, she began giving serious thought to developing the tale about Mrs. Tiggy-winkle and Lucie. She had been working on backgrounds and had been carrying her pet hedgehog with her when travelling. On 15 March she wrote her editor Norman Warne, \\"I have been drawing the stump of a hollow tree for another hedgehog drawing\\".Linder 1971, p. 156 Potter and Warne agreed volume of nursery rhymes would be created in 1905 but she also brought his attention to a story she had previously written, writing to him, \\"I think 'Mrs. Tiggy' would be all right; it is a girl's book ... there must be a large audience of little girls. I think they would like the different clothes.\\" She began the illustrations in the summer once he agreed to the concept.Lear 2007, p. 186-188 Illustrations and production Potter biographer Linda Lear writes that Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, unlike Potter's earlier work, was \\"a story set in a real place, about a real washerwoman, a real hedge-hog named Tiggy-winkle, and a child Lucie, from Little-town in the Newlands valley\\". In the summer of 1904, Potter again took her holiday at Lingholm, and drew pen and ink illustrations for the hedgehog book based on in watercolours made of the area the previous year. After returning to London in October, family matters prevented her from continuing work on the tale; she returned to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle in late November 1904. The sketchbook scenes of the path above Little Town, the Newlands Valley, the fells, and Skiddaw were reproduced in the published book almost exactly as found in the sketchbook, except for the inclusion of the figures and some minor artistic liberties. Potter included in her illustrations a depiction a small door used to close abandoned mine shafts in the fells. During her explorations of the area she visited farms at Skelghyl and sheep farms in the fells. Little Town is a hamlet that consists of the Newlands Church and a few farm buildings. The church can be seen in a grove of trees at the top left. The model for the preliminary illustrations of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was Potter's own pet hedgehog. Potter wrote to Warne on 12 November, \\"Mrs. Tiggy as a model is comical; so long as she can go to sleep on my knee she is delighted, but if she is propped up on end for half an hour, she first begins to yawn pathetically, and then she does bite! Nevertheless, she is a dear person; just like a very fat rather stupid little dog. I think the book will go all right when once started.\\" Three weeks later, she wrote, \\"The hedgehog drawings are turning out very comical. I have dressed up a cottonwool dummy for convenience of drawing the clothes. It is such a figure of fun.\\" The dummy terrified her rabbit and her pet mouse pulled out the stuffing. \\"I think it should make a good book,\\" she wrote, \\"When I have learnt to draw the child.\\"Lear pp. 190‚Äì191 Although Potter had little difficulty with the landscapes, the kitchen, and the birds and animals, Lucie presented a serious problem. Potter recognized and admitted the human form eluded her and confessed she faced a worrisome challenge whenever it was absolutely necessary to bring a human into an illustration. She made a number of preliminary sketches of Lucie, changed the colour of her cloak, and enlisted a real child as a model. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's kitchen is typical of those seen by Potter in Lakeland and Sawrey, and presented no artistic difficulties. She had been sketching interiors for years.Taylor 1987, p. 122 For artistic reasons, Potter moved Lucie Carr's house at Skelghyl to Little Town. By February 1905, the drawings for the book sent to be converted to blocks,Lear 2007, p. 192 and, in late March, she began The Pie and the Patty- Pan, the companion piece to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Potter continued to fuss with the tale's text and illustrations. The proofs of the text arrived in the beginning of June, and Potter laboured over them. She reconsidered the rhyme writing to Warne, > I do not think that rhyme is right grammar; it is the \\"no\\" that throws it > out. If it were :\\"Smooth and hot‚Äîred rusty spot :never here be seen‚Äîoh!\\" > that would be all right. She is supposed to be exorcising spots and iron > stains, same as Lady MacBeth(!). The verb is imperative, and apparently it > is not reasonable to use \\"no\\" with a vocative noun. It is a contradiction to > address \\"no spot!\\" I am afraid this is rather muddled; I used to know my > Latin grammar but it has faded ... I wish another book could be planned out > before the summer, if we are going on with them, I always feel very much > lost when they are finished.Linder 1971, p. 157 She had enjoyed developing the book with Warne, and, on 2 July, sent him the remainder of the book, expressing her regret that its production was over. On 25 July proofs sent to her from the publisher showed spottiness that may have been caused by the summer heat affecting the chemicals used in the engraving process; the plates were re-engraved in September.Lear 2007, pp. 198, 204  Publication history and adaptations  Twenty thousand copies of the book were released in a format in October 1905 with The Pie and the Patty-Pan.Linder 1971, p. 425 Another 10,000 copies were released in November 1905, and another 8,000 in January 1906. The dedication reads, \\"For the real little Lucie of Newlands\\"; Lucie's copy of the book was inscribed, \\"For little Lucie with much love from Beatrix Potter and from dear 'Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle' Sept. 24. 05.\\"Linder 1971, p. 158 Soon after the book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began showing signs of failing health. She wrote a friend on 1 February 1906, \\"I am sorry to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and has begun to be sick, and she is so thin. I am going to try some physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is beginning to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly.\\" A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington. The tale has had two dramatic adaptations. In 1971, Sir Frederick Ashton performed the role of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle in the Royal Ballet film The Tales of Beatrix Potter, which he also choreographed. Issue 58122. In 1993, the tale was adapted (with The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher) as one of six episodes of the animated BBC anthology series The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends. In the 2018 film Peter Rabbit, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is voiced by Australian singer-songwriter Sia doing a Scottish accent.  Miniature letters  Potter created a series of miniature letters for child fans between 1907 and 1912. These letters were written as from her characters and intended to shed light on their doings outside their tales and to tell the recipient more about them. Each letter was folded to represent an envelope, and addressed to the child recipient. There was a tiny stamp in the corner drawn with a red crayon. They were sent to the children in a miniature post bag marked G.P.O. that Potter had made herself or in a toy tin mail box enamelled bright red. \\"Some of the letters were very funny,\\" Potter wrote, \\"The defect was that inquiries and answers were all mixed up.\\"Linder 1971, p. 72 Potter sent miniature letters to the Moore children, to the Warne children, Lucie Carr and her older sister Kathleen, Master Drew Fayle, and to Master John and Miss Margaret Hough. Seven letters about Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle are extant. Mrs. Josephine Rabbit writes to complain of starch in her handkerchiefs, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle responds with apologies, Mrs. Rabbit then writes to compliment Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle on the \\"getting up of the children's muslin frocks\\" and promises not to seek another laundress. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle writes Master Fayle warning him that \\"[e]verything has got all mixed up in wrong bundles\\" and wondering if he has received Mr. Jeremy Fisher's shirt or Mrs. Flopsy Bunny's apron? Mrs. Bunny writes Master Drew that she is looking for her apron. She has received a shirt marked J.F. that is 3-inches long. Jeremy writes twice to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Once, to complain that he has received an apron marked F.B. and then to complain in a letter dated 22 January 1910: > Mr. J. Fisher regrets to have to complain again about the washing. Mrs. T. > Winkle has sent home an enormous handkerchief marked 'D. Fayle' instead of > the tablecloth marked J.F. If this continues every week, Mr. J. Fisher will > have to get married, so as to have the washing done at home.  Scholarly commentaries  Ruth K. MacDonald, Professor of English at New Mexico State University, past president of the Children's Literature Association, and author of Beatrix Potter (1986), views the plot of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle as \\"thin\\" and lacking the complications of Potter's previously published The Tale of Two Bad Mice (1905) and later books. The tale is held together, she asserts, by its attractive central character, and points out that, like many girls' books of the period, it is set indoors and revolves around household chores and duties. Unlike Two Bad Mice however, there is no ironic commentary on housekeeping; Potter gives her tacit approval to Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's spic and span cottage and her housekeeping practices. MacDonald points out that Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is the first of Potter's books to depict a countryside of simple dwellings, pathways, stone fences, and the timeless, unchanging ways of rural life. Actual place names in the tale such as Skelghyl, Garthsgate, and Little-town ground the tale in a real world locality yet the tale is mythologized by suggesting a remote time before mechanical means of doing laundry had been invented. She notes that Mrs. Tiggy-winkle has become \\"synonymous for female hedgehogs and for fastidious housekeepers\\".MacDonald 1986, p. 90 Mrs. Tiggy-winkle and Lucie give Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny their clean wash. M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh and author of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003) indicates Potter was venturing into new territory in creating a tale with a large human presence (Lucie). Potter's artistic uncertainty is evident in her attempt to establish a relationship between clothes and the social and animal selves of humans and animals. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle wears human clothing while the neighbourhood animals wear and shed only their skins. Logically, Kutzer points out, all the animals should wear either human clothing or only their skins. She believes Peter Rabbit's blue jacket is used in the tale as a gimmick to remind the reader that other Potter books exist for purchase, and a gimmick that disrupts Potter's artistic intent. If Peter wears human clothing then why do the other animals wear only their skins? The issue of animal clothing versus human clothing is further confused when Mrs. Tiggy-winkle sheds her human clothing at the end of the tale to reveal herself a hedgehog who may or may not be able to shed her skin as well. If she can shed her skin, then why is she wearing human clothes? Kutzer believes these questions remain unanswered and erode the tale's logic.Kutzer 2003, pp. 76‚Äì81 Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is a symbol of shedding the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world ‚Äì hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests ‚Äì but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot. By inserting her authorial voice in the tale's epilogue, Potter reveals her uncertainty about the believability of her fantasy, and her uncertainty mars the narrative line which, Kutzer remarks, is analogous to a \\"comedy sketch that should have stayed at joke length, but is unwisely stretched into ten minutes of tepid comedy.\\" The notion of having animals shed their skins for laundering provides opportunities for amusing illustrations, but the tale does not have a strong narrative line to hold it together or to grip the reader's attention. The tale is held together solely by the quaint language and work of the charming central character. Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter writes in Secret Gardens The Golden Age of Children's Literature that Potter's work shows thematic shifts, seeing in The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle a utopian theme of nature-as-redemption in which the background represents a return to Arcadia of sorts. Young Lucy finds in Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's kitchen a place of refuge, and although unlike Potter's previous stories the main character is unthreatened by other characters or external circumstances, Carpenter writes \\"while no external threat enters this most utopian of Potter's books, there is none the less something faintly sinister about Mrs. Tiggy-winkle herself\\".Carpenter, pp. 145‚Äì148  Merchandise  Beswick Pottery released a porcelain figurine modelled on the frontispiece of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle holding an iron. Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the \\"longevity of her books comes from strategy\\", writes her biographer Ruth MacDonald.MacDonald 1986, p. 128 Potter was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy, an unpublished board game, and nursery wallpaper.Lear 2008, pp. 172‚Äì5 Similar \\"side-shows\\" (as she termed the ancillary merchandise) were produced throughout her life.Taylor 1987, p. 106 Upon publication of the book, Norman Warne suggested a Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle pin cushion doll as a merchandising gimmick.Lear 2007, p. 197 Potter died on 22 December 1943 and left her home and the original illustrations for almost all of her books, including Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, to the National Trust. Hilltop was opened to visitors in 1946, and displayed her original artwork there until 1985.Taylor 1996, pp. 208‚Äì11 In 1947, Frederick Warne & Co. granted Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire \\"rights and licences to produce\\" the Potter characters in porcelain.Dubay 2006, p. 30 The next year, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was one of the first set of ten porcelain figurines released. Between 1985 and 1999 Beswick produced five more porcelain collectibles featuring the hedgehog, including her head as a mug in 1988, a larger version of the first figurine in 1996, and a limited edition tableau showing Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle in 1999.DuBay 2006, pp. 30‚Äì1,34‚Äì5 Beswick Pottery was eventually acquired by Royal Doulton, which continued to issue the figurines under the \\"Royal Albert\\" brand until it was discontinued in 2002.Dubay 2006, pp. 30, 37 Stuffed toy manufacturers requested licensing for Potter's figures as early as 1909; however she refused to grant permission, having been disappointed with the quality of the proposed toys. In the early 1970s Frederick Warne & Co. granted a licence for plush toys to an English firm, House of Nesbit Ltd., which produced seven characters, including Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Their finely detailed products were labour-intensive and unprofitable, and were discontinued after a short time. In 1973, Eden Toys of Jersey City, New Jersey received a licence to manufacture stuffed animals based on Potter's characters. Eden produced a plush Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle in 1974, and made at least three other versions of the hedgehog over the years, including an \\"Giant\\" model, originally intended for display in stores. All of these were discontinued by 2001, when Eden Toys went out of business.Dubay 2006, pp. 91‚Äì2, 94. 99, 101, 106 Potter's illustrations of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle were featured on biscuit tins made by Huntley & Palmer between 1974 and 1978,DuBay 2006, pp. 138‚Äì9 and on a series of enamel items made by Crummles of Poole, Dorset from 1974 to 1995. These included five different images on four different-sized enamel boxes, as well as an enamel thimble, needle case, and pin cushion.DuBay 2006, pp. 78‚Äì9, 81‚Äì2, 85, 87 From 1977 to 1995 (when it went out of business), Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts made or distributed a series of items featuring the hedgehog washerwoman. These included one of the first ten Potter music boxes the company released in 1977. Schmid distributed two Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle Christmas ornaments ( tall) and another music box, all made by the Italian firm ANRI, as well as a figurine made by Border Fine Arts, a Scottish firm, showing Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and other Potter characters around a Christmas tree.DuBay 2006, pp. 106‚Äì7, 130‚Äì131, 135 In 1979, Wedgewood produced a 16-piece Queen's Ware nursery set; each piece was decorated with artwork and accompanying text from The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Wedgwood retired the items, which were similar in style to its Peter Rabbit nursery ware, in 1995. In 1982, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was featured on Wedgwood's Happy Birthday plate, \\"the only year that a character other than Peter Rabbit was used on the annual plate\\".DuBay 2006, pp. 51, 53  Reprints and translations  In 1913, Warnes considered publishing some of Potter's little books in French and thought it best to remove any wording in English from the pictures. Potter redrew the illustration of the spring bubbling out of the hillside to omit the words \\"How Keld\\" (Norse for Hill Well). Potter noted in a letter that the words occasionally brought inquiries about their meaning. As of 2010, all 23 of Potter's small format books remain in print, and are available as complete sets in presentation boxes. A 400-page omnibus edition is also available. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is available in Kindle format. First editions and early reprints are occasionally offered by antiquarian booksellers. The English language editions of the tales still bore the Frederick Warne imprint in 2010 though the company was bought by Penguin Books in 1983. Penguin remade the printing plates from new photographs of the original drawings in 1985, and all 23 volumes were released in 1987 as The Original and Authorized Edition.Taylor 1996, p. 216 Potter's small format books have been translated into nearly thirty languages, including Greek and Russian. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was released in braille in 1921, and in the Initial Teaching Alphabet in 1965.Linder 1971, pp. 434‚Äì5 The tale was translated into French in 1922 as Poupette-√†-L'Epingle, and in Dutch as Het Verhall van Vrouwtje Plooi in 1969. In 1932, it was translated into Welsh as Hanes Meistres Tigi-Dwt, and into German in 1948 as Die Geschichte von Frau Tiggy-Winkle.Linder 1971, p. 436 In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a \\"traditional part of childhood in most only English-speaking countries and in many of the countries into whose languages Potter's books have been translated\\".MacDonald 1986, p. 130 Cultural impact The British wildlife hospital Tiggywinkles is named after Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle.

It has 13 members appointed for a five-year term by the Governor General of Belize.  Establishment and appointment  Senators are appointed by the Governor General in the following manner: * 6 with the advice of the Prime Minister * 3 with the advice of Leader of the Opposition * 1 each with the advice of the following organizations jointly: ** the Belize Council of Churches and Evangelical Association of Churches ** the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Belize Business Bureau ** the National Trade Union Congress of Belize and the Civil Society Steering Committee ** non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in good standing In practice, the party that wins the general election (by capturing the most seats in the lower house of representatives) also controls the Senate. In previous incarnations, eight senators were appointed, five by the Prime Minister, two by the Leader of the Opposition and one by the Governor General and the Belize Advisory Council. One more senator was given to the opposition beginning in the 1990s.  Requirements for appointment  * Minimum age: 21 years * Citizenship: Belizean (no allegiances to foreign states) * Residence: in Belize for at least a year prior to nomination * Who cannot be Senators: members of the House, members of the armed and police forces, persons contracted to work for the Government.  Appointments to Cabinet  Occasionally, a Prime Minister may find it necessary to appoint a Senator to a post in the Cabinet. The first such instance was for C.L.B. Rogers under George Price in 1979 after losing his seat in the House. Price also appointed Ralph Fonseca, who did not run in the 1989 general election, to a Minister of State post until he ran and won in a newly created constituency in 1993. In 1997, the UDP appointed Belize Ambassador to Mexico, Mr. Alfredo \\"Fred\\" Martinez a Senator to also serve in Cabinet as Minister of Trade & Industry, thereby relinquishing his Ambassadorial appointment, to which he would later return. Former Senator Richard \\"Dickie\\" Bradley twice lost elections to the House and was appointed a Senator and given a Cabinet post each time. Following the 2012 general elections, the UDP lost its supermajority and exercised its constitutional limit to appointing four senators to serve as Ministers. One, Godwin Hulse, had served as a Senator dating back to 2006 and was appointed Leader of Government Business in the House, while three others are newcomers to national administration (Charles Gibson is a former senior public officer and served as CEO under John Saldivar in the Ministry of the Public Service; he was appointed as Minister for that portfolio in 2012.)  Meetings and duties  The Senate traditionally meets in session in the week immediately following a House meeting. Senators will discuss the measures sent by the House for review and approval, then vote on whether they should be sent back or approved. Beginning in late 2005, the Senate convened an investigation into allegations of mismanagement of public funds at the Social Security Board. This committee was headed by Senator Godwin Hulse and featured senators Dickie Bradley, Moises Chan, and Rene Gomez. Arthur Roches was also supposed to appear as the UDP representative but declined under pressure from the Opposition. These Senators questioned persons working at the Board in the last five years over the activities of the Board. In June 2006, the Senate released a report in which it roundly condemned the actions of General Manager Narda Garcia and Chairman Yasin Shoman in presiding over the questionable investment of millions of dollars in failed projects of former House member Glenn Godfrey. It called for their removal and reforms to be made to the laws governing Social Security. Shoman and Garcia deny any wrongdoing, but both have been removed from the Board, Garcia choosing to challenge this in court. On October 28, 2006, Chief Justice Abdulai Conteh denied Garcia judicial review, claiming the Senate had no case to answer. Garcia has settled out of court with the Social Security board over her contract, receiving an additional eighty thousand dollars. Following an appeal of the decision, on November 16, 2006, Conteh denied Garcia leave to appeal the previous decision. Garcia can still appeal to Belize's Court of Appeal. Officers The Senate elects both a President and Vice-President of the Senate upon first convening after a general election. The person elected president may be a senator (provided he/she does not concurrently hold a ministerial position) or a person external to the Senate. The vice-president must be a member of the Senate who does not hold a ministerial portfolio. (Constitution, Art. 66)  Current Senators  (as of June 3, 2019) * Darrell Bradley , President * Carla Barnett, UDP; Vice President of the Senate * Godwin Hulse, UDP; Leader of Government Business * Stephen Duncan, UDP * Michael Peyrefitte, UDP * Macario Coy, UDP * Aldo Salazar, UDP * Paul Thompson, PUP * Eamon Courtenay, PUP * Valerie Woods, PUP * Mark Lizarraga, Business Community * Elena Smith, Trade Unions * Ashley Rocke, Churches * Osmany Salas, NGOs  Recent history  Senators occasionally use their position as a springboard for election to the lower house which really wields much of the Legislature's power. Most Senators who do go on to contest elections usually have the backing of their party establishment. In October 2006,Channel5Belize three new Senators, Esther Ayuso Ramirez, Dr. Deborah Mencias-McMillan and Diego Bol were appointed on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition to replace outgoing Senators Marcel Cardona, Ambrose Tillett and Arthur Roches. This frees Roches and Cardona to run for House seats in 2008. In June 2007, as a result of an Executive reshuffle, Eamon Courtenay was removed as a Senator. He was replaced by Ambassador to the United States and OAS, Lisa Shoman (ironically, they were both respectively informed of their demotion and promotion by phone while participating in a meeting in Panama.Channel5Belize ) Courtenay and Minister of Natural Resources John Briceno were fired on Monday June 4.Channel5Belize September 2007 brings more upheaval to the Senate. Channel 5 Channel5Belize reported that Anthony Chanona resigned over disagreements with a recent bill argued before the Senate. His replacement, Dr. David Hoy, was named in November.

After nearly three years of litigation, Ngige's victory was overturned by the Court of Appeal on 15 March 2006. Obi took office for on 17 March 2006. On 2 November 2006, he was impeached by the state house of assembly after seven months in office and was replaced the next day by Virginia Etiaba, his deputy, making her the first- ever female governor in Nigeria's history. Obi successfully challenged his impeachment and was re-instated as the governor on 9 February 2007 by the Court of Appeal sitting in Enugu. Etiaba handed power back to him after the court ruling. Obi once again left office on 29 May 2007 following the general elections, which Andy Uba won. Obi returned to the courts once more, this time contending that the four-year tenure he had won in the 2003 elections only started to run when he took office in March 2006. On 14 June 2007 the Supreme Court of Nigeria upheld Obi's contention and returned Obi to office. This brought to an abrupt end the tenure of Obi's successor, Andy Uba whose April 14, 2007 election the Supreme Court nullified on the grounds that Obi's four- year tenure should have remained undisturbed until March 2010.

Modelled after the classic private gardens of the Ming Dynasty, the garden offers an insight into Chinese heritage and culture. It was designed by Guangzhou Garden Planning & Building Design Institute, Tsang & Lee, and Edmond Bull & Corkery and built from 1986 to 1988 by Gutteridge Haskins & Davey; the Darling Harbour Authority; Imperial Gardens; Leightons; and Australian Native Landscapes. The gardens were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 October 2018. The Chinese Garden of Friendship was designed by Sydney's Chinese sister city, Guangzhou in China. Sydney's Chinatown complements the area's already rich in Chinese heritage and culture. The garden was officially opened 17 January 1988 as part of Sydney's Bicentennial Celebrations and named the Chinese Garden of Friendship symbolising the bond established between China and Australia. The Garden is located at the corner of Day Street and Pier Street, , on the site of the former NSW Fresh Food and Ice Co, which is considered significant in the development of refrigeration and freezing in Sydney.  History  The Aboriginal name for Darling Harbour is Tumbalong.Sydney City Council, 2019 Prior to colonisation the site was open water adjacent to a low lying swampy area. From about 1850 to 1984 the site was filled-in and used as industrial land. The land that would become the Chinese Garden of Friendship is in Cockle Bay and was progressively reclaimed and industrialised from the early years of the 19th century. Industries included ship building and repairs around the edges of the water, while further inland predominant uses were engineering workshops, metal foundries and food milling factories. The site was first developed as Mort's Fresh Food & Ice Company in the 1850s with internationally significant developments in refrigeration technology arising from this period. Late 19th century light industrial buildings on the site and in its vicinity were demolished in 1985 as part of the Bicentenary redevelopment of Darling Harbour. This site history is uncommon for overseas Chinese gardens, which are typically located in existing parklands. The exception is several gardens in Hong Kong that were built in the 1970s-80s on reclaimed waterside industrial land. The Landscape Section of the NSW Public Works, Government Architect's Branch were directly involved in development and construction of the garden. Oi Choong, then Head of the Landscape Section, notes that along with the Mount Tomah Botanic Garden, the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan and Bicentennial Park, Homebush Bay, the Chinese Garden of Friendship is one of the few seminal landscapes built to celebrate Australia's bicentenary.Choong, pers.comm., 27/7/2018 The Chinese Garden of Friendship was formally opened to the public in 1988 during the Bicentennial celebrations. It was the culmination of years of lobbying by Sydney's Chinese communities, and a complex design and construction process undertaken jointly by the Guangzhou Garden Planning & Design Institute and the Darling Harbour Authority. Henry Tsang , a leading figure in Sydney's Chinese community, a member of Sydney City Council (1991-1999), and the New South Wales Legislative Council (1999-2009), had advocated the establishment of a Chinese garden in Sydney since the 1970s. At that time, overseas Chinese gardens were first established in Hong Kong and Singapore. In the early 1980s, the grounds of Sydney's two oldest Chinese temples (Tze Yup temple in Glebe, and Yiu Ming temple in Alexandria) were embellished with new boundary walls and pailou (gates). At the same time, the local Chinese community in British Columbia had succeeded in having a Chinese garden established in Vancouver, which opened in 1982. With the announcement in 1984 of the redevelopment of Darling Harbour to align with the upcoming 1988 bicentenary of colonisation, the local Chinese community lobbied the NSW government for a garden site in Darling Harbour. Tsang approached Neville Wran, the then Premier of New South Wales (1976-1986), to allocate an area of crown land for a traditional Chinese garden to celebrate the role of the Chinese community in developing Australia's commercial and social structures since the early 19th century. Tsang and the local Chinese community were able to secure from Wran a site adjacent to Chinatown in Haymarket, and helped facilitate an intergovernmental relationship between the Province of Guangdong and State of New South Wales to jointly fund, design and construct the new garden. The relationship between Sydney and Guangzhou (previously Romanized as Canton), the capital of Guangdong province, is particularly strong because of trade and migration since the earliest days of colonisation. The agreement stipulated Guangdong would provide the design of the garden and key building materials, furniture and artworks that are intrinsic to the classic garden typology, while New South Wales would manage and fund its construction through the Darling Harbour Authority. The garden design is a built and horticultural expression of a private garden, sometimes described as a scholar's or classical garden. Garden typologies created over the last thousand years from the Song to the Qin dynasties demonstrate many historical, philosophical and regional variations. For instance, the cold climate Northern garden styles favour deciduous plant species and an urban character, while the warmer temperate climates of the Southern styles are marked by lusher sub-tropical plantings. Southern styles are sometimes called Cantonese, from their associations with Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan provinces and Hong Kong and Macau, or Lingnam, meaning \\"south of the mountains\\", referring to the region's location south of the Five Ranges of the Yangtze Valley. Generally, a private garden is a place of retreat and reflection, poetry, art, calligraphy and horticulture. The Garden of Friendship design weaves the principles of auspicious positioning and orientation to channel positive qi energy through the garden; provides a preferred large and central water body to capture positive energy otherwise expressed as wealth and prosperity; demonstrates the placement of landforms to block unfavourable weather while opening the garden to the positive movement of the sun; places pavilions around the water body to reflect upon and disseminate the positive energy stored within the water body; and establishes key visual connections between the host and guest pavilions and landscape. A 2004 feng shui assessment of the garden considered it as a reflection of these design principles and as an embodiment of the five elemental relationships between water, earth, air, wood and steel. There is considerable documentation of the challenges with building the garden, from the initial Cantonese concept drawings and their conversion into Australian-style construction drawings; sourcing local trades people with the skills to undertake very unusual construction methodologies; finding suitable local building materials; importing special materials from China such as artworks, furniture, tiles and feature rocks; and the politics of Chinese working on the site within the strict union rules and regulations of the time. The garden was formally opened on 17 January 1988, at the commencement of the Bicentennial celebrations that strongly focused on Australia's achievements as a multi-cultural society with an official theme of \\"Living Together\\". It was first such garden in the southern hemisphere, the second in an English-language settler society after Vancouver, and among the earliest in the world. This process of \\"translation\\", in which a Southern-style garden was recontextualised in the setting of the new Darling Harbour development, brought together a unique fusion of Cantonese and Sydneysider styles, materials, artisanship and horticultural practices. In the spirit of \\"translation\\", the garden's plantings have evolved greatly since that time. It was very raw when opened and being a new landscape was overplanted in the expectation that natural losses would occur. It has prospered, and over time plants have had to be removed to give others around them room to expand, and to preserve particular visual connections. Like any living garden, the Garden of Friendship is continually changing, and these dynamic processes are actively managed to retain the original design spirit and integrity while allowing its evolution in response to climatic and social changes, and the natural life cycles of living plants. Key elements within the townscape setting for the Garden of Friendship are Tumbalong Park and Tumbalong Boulevard. Tumbalong Park is a key link in the qi line from the garden to Cockle Bay, while the boulevard is the effective buffer between the garden and the very large International Convention Centre Sydney structures. The qi line has been marked since 2017 by a bronze strip across the stage in Tumbalong Park symbolically linking the garden with the parkland and the waters of Darling Harbour.Place Management NSW Launching The Chinese Garden of Friendship's 30th Anniversary in 2018, the initiative of Minister Victor Dominello with the Chinese Gardens Advisory Panel welcomed key community leaders and representatives to celebrate Chinese New Year during a magical auspicious evening that marks CNY in one of the city's key cultural places. 2018 will see the garden's planned development plans and community collaboration in building a prosperous future for the Gardens.Haymarket Chamber of Commerce, 17 March 2018 The gardens held a festival to celebrate 30-year anniversary with events between 29 September to 14 October 2018.Central Magazine, 26 September 2018, p.7 On 4 October 2018 Dominello, as Minister for Services and Property, used an event celebrating the Garden's 30th anniversary as an opportunity to announce that Gabrielle Upton MP, Minister for Heritage had recently added the place on the State Heritage Register. The event was well attended by the Heritage Council with the Chair, Deputy Chair, Mark Dunn, Louise Cox, Bruce Pettman, and with Prof Richard Mackay amongst a strong Chinese community presence.Smith, Tim, pers.comm., 5/10/18  Description  The garden is a designed landscape largely enclosed by a masonry wall, covering in area. This area is composed of three main elements: * garden landscaping, * lake and streams, * pavilions and other structures, The site includes the forecourt entrance stairs, fire egress ramp, two imperial guardian lion (or ski) statues and plantings of Chinese elms (Ulmus parvifolia), all of which adjoin the garden wall outside the garden proper. Much of Cockle Bay comprises 19th century, introduced fill of unknown quality, provenance and changed ground levels. Following reclamation, this site had multiple industrial uses from the early 19th century on, with its final use being for warehousing. Industrial remnants are buried below the garden. The various elements are described in turn below. ;The Garden Wall The garden is enclosed by a white painted, rendered masonry wall on three sides (south, east and north). The wall is approximately in height and capped with scroll styled terracotta tiles. The western side is defined by a palisade fence transitioning to a mixed water and pavilion edge. The palisade fence is atypical but included so passing pedestrians can see into and be attracted to visit the garden. This \\"open\\" fence also has a very important role in the feng shui of the garden, allowing the qi energy to move from the garden towards Cockle Bay. ;Forecourt The garden entrance is defined by stairs and podium with two imperial guardian lion (or shi) statues protecting the entrance, one male and one female. The stairs and podium, while outside the walls, are part of the garden proper and of the quarantine fumigation process. Some ceramic trays (pen or pun) and some specimen stones, are from Guangdong. ;Pavilions There are 17 pavilions in the garden, some interconnected, others are free standing, constructed with components from both China and Australia, including: * grey roof tiles (Guangdong) * golden glazed roof (Guangdong) * Gurr pavilion, granite paving and handrails (Guangdong) * grey bricks (from Guangdong, recycled from demolished historic buildings). The bricks were refurbished and polished in China * grey floor tiles (Shanghai) * grey ceramic door and window reveals (Shanghai) * ceramic grills (Shanghai) * granite column bases, margins, cladding, handrails, paving and door frames (Fujian) * geometric timber tracery, and other structural elements (New South Wales) ;Water Lake in the Garden. The water bodies including the lake, pond and brooks, are constructed with a concrete base liner. The waterfall rockwork is sprayed concrete over a wire formwork, similar to the technique used in the artificial grottoes in the animal enclosures at Taronga Zoo, Mosman. Water is recycled, filtered and UV treated similarly to a public fountain system. ;Garden rock All general landscape rock is water-weathered fossiliferous limestone from an ancient river bed, excavated from Cumnock Station, in Cabonne Shire, NSW Central West. In China, similarly water-worn rock was very highly prized in gardens, often coming from Lake Tai. This represents a local variation in material on a traditional pattern of use. ;Garden granite bridges All stone bridges are granite from Guangdong, China. ;Featured rock sculptures * Ying rocks in the Courtyard of Welcoming Fragrance are weathered limestone quarried from the mountains of Yingde, a district in south Guangdong * Ying rock sculptured mountain and stairs to the Tea House are from Yingde in China (see above) * Taihui rock in the garden of the Hall of Longevity is a rare weathered limestone from Lake Tai in China and a gift from Guangdong * Wax rock in paved courtyard of Hall of Longevity is a rare river-moulded rock and a gift from Guangdong. ;The dragon wall The Dragon Wall is a double sided, free-standing screen made of glazed terracotta from China, commissioned specifically for this garden and a gift from the government of Guangdong. The wall depicts a blue dragon representing New South Wales and a brown dragon representing Guangdong, both are in search of the pearl of wisdom. The wall design is based on the \\"nine dragon walls\\" in Datong, Shangxi. The wall was manufactured by Shiran Glazed Pottery in 943 pieces and assembled on site by potters from China. ;The main, or Mountain Gate This gate was a gift from the government of Guangdong. ;Landscape paving All paving including pebble mosaics are supplied and laid by New South Wales contractors. The mosaic patterns are both decorative and suggest a natural stone scree found along the edges of lakes and rivers. ;Pavilion artworks All art including calligraphy, wall hangings and paintings are a gift from the government of Guangdong. ;Pavilion furniture All traditional furniture pieces are a gift from Guangdong, while the recent addition of a display cabinet in the Water Pavilion was designed and built in New South Wales. ;Planting All plants were sourced in New South Wales, including Australian and exotic species. There are two lychee trees (Litchi chinensis) that were planted by visiting governors of Guangdong province in 2009 and 2015. Lychee is one of the \\"four great fruits of Lingnan\\", along with banana, pineapple and paw paw. ;Penjing (kV) collection Tenjing', or 'pun-gingE'l (Ek-i)in Cantonese, roughly translates as \\"landscapes in a tray\\" or \\"tray scenery\\". It focuses on creating a miniature landscape of trees and rock, sometimes with added figurines and landscape elements such as bridges, pavilions and farm animals. The collection commenced in 1992 and is largely created in the Cantonese or Lingnan style of penjing, which is particular to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. This style pays particular attention to matching the natural and artificial elements, such as plant and pot. There are 17 individual examples in the collection, composed of 13 different species including two Port Jackson figs (Ficus rubignosa). Ages of individual penjing, where known, range from 12 years to about 70 years. All have been cultivated and styled in Sydney by penjing artists. Two very old and well regarded penjing were sent from Guangdong as a gift in 1988, but they did not survive the quarantine fumigation process. Some of the ceramic trays (pen or pun), and some of the specimen stones, are from Guangdong. The penjing collection is owned by the Crown through Place Management NSW.  Condition  As at 6 June 2018, the condition of the gardens' fabric was good to excellent; and the archaeological potential was moderate to high. The integrity of the site was excellent. Overall, the garden is little changed since construction. The plantings have matured considerably since 1988 and have at times affected key visual connections between various elements. General maintenance and considered interventions are addressing these matters over time.  Modifications and dates  *2005: Conversion of the Blue Room (pre-2005 it was used as a cafe), located above the current cafe seating area, due to poor access. The Blue Room remains in original condition and is now used as a meeting room and for internal staff activities only. It is not currently (at the time of nomination in 2018) accessible to the public although this may change in the future. *An original memorabilia shop was converted into the current cafe. To build a new kitchen, a small open courtyard at the back of the shop, where the penjing collection was originally displayed, was demolished. The penjing collection was relocated to the Courtyard of Welcoming Fragrance as the garden entry. *The forecourt was remodelled to accommodate an access ramp for those with a disability, and generally enlarged to the west to give the entrance more presence in the broader Darling Harbour landscape. *In 2013 the public toilet along the southern wall was internally renovated. There was no change in its footprint. *The pavilions are in original condition. Ongoing maintenance has focussed on painting and minor repairs only. renovation.  Further information  Prior to colonisation the site was open water adjacent to a low lying swampy area. From about 1850 to 1984 the site was in-filled and used as industrial land.  In popular culture  The garden was used as a scene for Dulcea's compound in 20th Century Fox's 1995 superhero film Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie and also in the filming of The Wolverine in October 2012. Although many features of the gardens were changed or covered up as the movie was set in Japan - removal of all Chinese calligraphy and dragon motifs and a temporary pavilion built in the centre of the lake.  Heritage listing  As at 6 August 2018, The Chinese Garden of Friendship is state significant as an outstanding exemplar of a community-based late overseas Chinese garden of the type found in Australasia, North America and Europe constructed in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It was the first Southern or Cantonese style garden in New South Wales developed cooperatively between Sydney's Chinese communities and public authorities in New South Wales and Guangdong. The Garden demonstrates living traditions of over a thousand years in formal garden design and making in China and long continuities of particularly Southern, formal garden design and horticultural practices. It transcends boundaries between Cantonese cultural sensibilities within Sydney's urban context. Its penjing collection of miniature landscapes, cultivated in Sydney, diverse in their use of indigenous plant species such as the Port Jackson fig as well as species from China. The collection's cross-cultural significance is enhanced by geometric timber tracery screens and open-sided pavilions copied from historic Sydney models as a conscious expression of Chinoiserie. They provided a degree of popular familiarity and receptivity to Chinese gardens that hailed the construction of this garden. The Garden is a unifying element tying the larger scale of the new Darling Harbour and older, more intimate spaces of Haymarket's streets and lanes. The continuing development of Sydney's Chinese communities are reflected in its Southern Chinese design and artisanship, in conjunction with Sydney and New South Wales' materials and construction. The Garden provides continuity to a landscape rooted in the ever-more sophisticated Haymarket Chinatown of which it is now a distinct quarter. The Garden symbolises the welcoming of Australian-Chinese communities into New South Wales and Australian society. It represents the successful collaboration of Cantonese and Sydney designers, technicians and tradesmen and the transfer of traditional skills and techniques. It is a unique example of cross-cultural exchange in the construction of built and landscape forms that clearly demonstrate the rich heritage of Guangdong and Southern China translated into a new and unique garden enjoyed by the whole community. Chinese Garden of Friendship was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 October 2018 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is historically significant at the State level for evidence of the human activity of making and maintaining gardens and landscape design. It continues over a thousand-years of formal garden design and making in China and some two hundred years of formal garden design and making in New South Wales. Its particular style shows blending of Southern or Cantonese design and elements from Guangdong with building and plant materials from New South Wales to produce a historically unique garden in Sydney. The Garden is historically significant for associations with the symbolic public acceptance of Australian-Chinese communities as part of broader New South Wales and Australian communities during 1988 bicentennial celebrations, when multiculturalism and a theme of \\"Living Together\\" were strongly promoted. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is historically significant for maintaining and showing continuing development of Sydney and broader Australian-Chinese communities. These have continued since the 1850s, creating and using a sequence of vernacular and designed structures and landscapes across the state reflecting Chinese and more particularly Cantonese, design and artisanship, local materials and construction practices. The Garden, as a product of desires of the local community, is evidence of this process of \\"translation\\" of a venerable historic institution, the formal garden, into a new physical and cultural environment and a desire for a public expression of culture and outreach. The Garden expresses Cantonese cultural sensibilities in a Sydney context and blurs boundaries between them. It continues, through its dynamic nature and continuing maintenance, to be a manifestation of two centuries of cultural, social and economic exchange between New South Wales and Guangdong. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is historically significant for demonstrating increasingly sophisticated development of distinctive Chinatowns in Sydney and especially Haymarket, which continues to thrive and grow while earlier examples, such as in The Rocks and Surry Hills, are now mainly historical, rather than living communities. The Garden is also historically significant for its capacity to demonstrate urban renewal in Sydney as a world city. Its location in Darling Harbour, formerly a polluted industrial area, subsequent survival and development during later waves of renewal here, are evidence of historical importance in anchoring and providing continuity in periods of upheaval associated with urban renewal. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is state-significant in representing the successful collaboration of Cantonese and Sydneysider architects, landscape architects, technicians and tradesmen in transferring traditional skills and techniques. Elements such as pavilions, bridges, rockwork, landscape art and furniture reflect Chinese architectural styles, some constructed by artisans from Guangzhou while others by locals trained using materials and techniques otherwise rare in Australia. The gardens represent a unique example of innovative and cross-cultural exchange. The Garden is state-significant for creative or technical innovation or achievement, such as its penjing collection of miniature landscapes known in a limited number of overseas Chinese gardens, including Singapore, Seattle, Montreal, Portland and Huntington. These have been cultivated in Sydney and form a distinctive and highly creative element, especially their use of indigenous species such as Port Jackson fig. The collection has inspired development of other collections in New South Wales and establishment of a Penjing Academy. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is significant for its aesthetic distinctiveness as the only example of a Southern style Chinese garden in New South Wales and Australia. Stylistic elements such as golden roof tiles, grey bricks, water bodies, granite bridges, natural rock sculptures, dragon wall and Mountain Gate exemplify the style, as do plantings such as lychees. There is no other landscape of comparable aesthetic distinctiveness in New South Wales. The geometric timber tracery screens and the open-sided pavilions exemplify elements copied as a conscious expression of imaginary Chinese styles, known as Chinoiserie, intended for a Western audience. They exemplify the original forms of such a style and show capacity to respond to local climate in providing perforated screens and shading for outdoor rooms and verandahs. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is state- significant for its landmark qualities as uniting the new larger scale of Sydney International Convention Exhibition and Entertainment Precinct (SICEEP) structures and spaces in Darling Harbour and the older, more intimate scale of Haymarket's enclosing streets and lanes. Motorists travelling on the A4 motorway obtain glimpses of its pavilions through trees and over the wall, as do residents of apartment towers, views not available anywhere else. In distant views, the Garden forms a distinctive landmark of greenery and trees in a highly urban environment. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is state- significant for its special associations with Sydney's Chinese communities and broader Australian Chinese communities. The garden hosts community meetings, plays an important role in annual Chinese New Year celebrations, cultural activities such as traditional tea ceremonies, Chinese Opera and penjing display competitions. The Garden is important to the community's sense of place because of its location in transitional space between the older Chinatown of Haymarket and urban renewal spaces of Darling Harbour. The Garden is increasingly regarded in Sydney's Chinese communities as a quarter of Chinatown, its \\"domain\\" or parkland that helps reinforce a strong sense of place and provides space for respite and reflection, celebration and community-building in an area of growing high-rise buildings and population. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is significant for its importance to a community's sense of place, shown in records and event data that show some 230,000 visitors during 2016-17 and an annual average over 2012-2017 of 205,000. Visitors include school groups, school holiday programs, evening functions and wedding ceremonies, as well as filming and photography activities. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Chinese Garden of Friendship is rare on the state level as the only example in New South Wales of a Southern or Cantonese style garden, developed in co-operation between Sydney's local Chinese communities, relevant authorities in New South Wales and Guangdong. More recent Chinese gardens in New South Wales use different styles and have not been developed to the same extent or in a similar highly urban context. In a national and global context, this is an early example of a Chinese Garden outside China, following the Dr Sun Yat Sen Garden in Canada and the Bochun Garden in Germany by two years. At least 16 Chinese gardens were built globally outside China after Sydney's garden, and thus it is rare in NSW and also part of a small group globally. The Garden is rare for its capacity to demonstrate designs and techniques of exceptional interest, especially transfer of knowledge and skills between Guangdong and New South Wales in construction of built and landscape forms demonstrating the rich built and horticultural heritage of Guangdong and Southern China. The Chinese Garden of Friendship gives rare evidence of Sydney's Chinese communities and broader Australian-Chinese communities and the uncommon act of establishing and maintaining a Chinese garden as a public park, which expresses a particular Southern style as adapted and translated in New South Wales to form a place of unique importance to those, other Australian and all visiting communities.

The series begins six months after Joaquin's promotion at the local copper mine enabled him to move the family to a better neighborhood. Based on the life of series creator Peter Murrieta, the series attempted to examine the themes of cultural identity, family and class. The family's former neighborhood was mentioned to be an impoverished area, where the family home had bars on the windows and was subject to frequent police helicopter flyovers. Stereotypes of Mexican- American culture are lampooned in the series, and used self-deprecatingly. The show's title was meant to imitate the caption of a postcard, and the title sequence displayed the cast and credits on a series of postcards. The same visual device was used to transition between scenes. The exterior shot of the daughter's apartment building is a photograph of a real Tucson apartment complex, Casa Royale. The show's theme song was performed by Los Lobos.

The community of Cefn comprises the villages of Cefn Mawr, Cefn-bychan (\\"little ridge\\"), Acrefair, Penybryn, Newbridge, Plasmadoc and Rhosymedre and is situated on the northern slopes of the Dee Valley.  History  Cefn Mawr was part of the ancient parish of Ruabon and the area was known as Cristionydd Cynrig (or Cristioneth Kenrick in English). In 1844, most of Cristionydd Cynrig, together with the neighbouring township of Coed Cristionydd became part of the new parish of Rhosymedre.Rhosymedre, St John, GENUKI Cefn railway station served the village from 1848 to 1960.  Industry  The former bakery of the Cefn & District Co-operative Society Cefn Mawr was formerly heavily industrialised, with large deposits of iron and coal and sandstone, and heavy industry dominated the area in the 18th and 19th centuries. Iron was worked at several blast furnaces and forges throughout the area and coal was mined at pits in Cefn, Plas Kynaston and Dolydd. Stone was cut at quarries above Cefn Mawr. Much of the mineral wealth of the area was exported by canal over the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct on the Shropshire Union Canal, until the railway reached Ruabon in 1855. In 1867 Robert Ferdinand Graesser, an industrial chemist from Obermosel in Saxony, Germany, established a chemical works at Plas Kynaston to extract paraffin oil and paraffin wax from the local shale. The company later expanded into the production of coal tar, and carbolic acid (phenol). The site soon became the world's leading producer of phenol. In 1919 the US chemical company Monsanto entered into a partnership with Graesser's chemical works to produce vanillin, salicylic acid, aspirin, and later rubber processing chemicals. The site was later operated by Flexsys, a subsidiary of Solutia, but production ceased in 2010. With the closure of the nearby Air Products site at Acrefair, manufacturing in the village has almost disappeared. The village still has a supermarket, which has changed hands from Kwik Save to Somerfield to the Co-Op. A large Tesco store was opened in March 2012 on the former site of the village football team, Cefn Druids. After buying this land, Tesco agreed to contribute to the construction of the new football ground located half a mile (1 km) away near the neighbouring village of Rhosymedre.

The Louisiana State Museum (LSM), founded in New Orleans in 1906, is a statewide system of National Historic Landmarks and modern structures across Louisiana, housing thousands of artifacts and works of art reflecting Louisiana's legacy of historic events and cultural diversity. Overview The Louisiana State Museum system has its beginnings in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904 at St. Louis, Missouri. A large number of pertinent artifacts were gathered to be displayed at Louisiana's exhibition at this fair. After the Exposition, it was decided that this collection should be stored, expanded, and displayed. The Louisiana State Museum was established in 1906 to fulfill this role. The Presbytere and the Cabildo buildings, located on either side of the St. Louis Cathedral on Jackson Square, were some of the first properties that the Louisiana State Museum was lodged in. The Louisiana State Museum now has thirteen properties around the state: historic structures, museums open to the public, and modern purpose-built buildings. Over the past 100-plus years, the Louisiana State Museum has not only operated museums and maintained buildings, but it has served as the repository for all things historic from the state‚Äôs past. As Louisiana has been part of a French colony, a Spanish colony, Napoleon‚Äôs short-lived property, the United States' Louisiana Purchase territory, and finally the state of Louisiana; the Louisiana State Museum‚Äôs collections of artifacts and documents are an important asset for understanding state, national, and even global history. In addition to protecting and preserving Louisiana‚Äôs historic artifacts and buildings, the Louisiana State Museum is proactive in many areas concerning the state‚Äôs unique culture and history. Several new museum sites have opened in the last ten years or so, including the Wedell-Williams Aviation & Cypress Sawmill Museum - Patterson location, the Performing Arts Center at the New Orleans Mint, the Capitol Park Museum - Baton Rouge, and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame & Northwest Louisiana History Museum ‚Äì Natchitoches. In addition to opening new facilities, the State Museum is continually creating new temporary and permanent exhibits, bringing to light intriguing topics from Louisiana‚Äôs culture and history. The Museum hosts an array of programs such as lecture series, school group educational tours, walking tours of historic districts, and musical performances. Numerous organizations exist throughout Louisiana to support the Museum including the Louisiana Museum Foundation, Friends of the Cabildo, Friends of the Capitol Park Museum, Wedell-Williams and Cypress Sawmill Foundation, Friends of Louisiana Sports and History, and Friends of the E.D. White Historic Site. Sites in the French Quarter, New Orleans 2nd Floor gallery of the Cabildo, 10 flags over Louisiana * The Cabildo - Spain's old City Hall, or \\"Casa Capitular,\\" built in 1799. Site of the two Louisiana Purchase transfers of 1803 (from Spain to France, and from France to the U.S.). Housed various government offices, including the Louisiana Supreme Court. The Cabildo displays three floors of exhibits concerning Louisiana's history, with additional changing exhibits in the adjoining Arsenal building. Old U.S. Mint Museum * New Orleans Mint - A United States Mint built under the direction of President Andrew Jackson in 1835. It was the only U.S. Mint to ever mint under a flag other than that of the United States, as it briefly minted coins for the Confederacy. The building also served as a federal prison and a Coast Guard depot before becoming a Louisiana State Museum. There is a permanent exhibit on the Mint's coining operations, exhibits on Louisiana music on the 2nd floor, a Performing Arts Center on the 3rd floor, and the Louisiana Historical Center and archives on the 3rd floor. * The Presbyt√®re - Originally built to serve as housing for the local clergy, it served many functions before becoming a Louisiana State Museum property in 1911. The first two floors house exhibits and the third floor houses the State Museum offices. the Arsenal * The Arsenal - Built in 1839, the Arsenal stands adjacent to the Cabildo on the site of the old Spanish Arsenal built in 1762. Its first floor acts as a classroom for visiting school groups, the second floor houses changing exhibits, and the third floor serves as meeting space. The Arsenal is accessible through the adjoining Cabildo museum. 1850 House exhibit * 1850 House, a historic house museum in the Lower Pontalba Building. The 1850 House museum depicts middle-class family life during the most prosperous period in New Orleans' history through a fully furnished three story apartment in the Lower Pontalba building. The first floor houses a museum gift shop, operated by Friends of the Cabildo. * The Creole House - Built in 1842 on the site of a colonial prison, the Creole House is the headquarters for the Friends of the Cabildo, the Louisiana State Museum's support foundation for the French Quarter museums. * The Jackson House - This structure derives its name from Andrew Jackson, the hero of the Battle of New Orleans. The original 1842 building was rebuilt by the WPA in 1936. There are currently no exhibits on display. Madame John's Legacy * Madame John's Legacy - A building of historic significance because it escaped the Great New Orleans Fire (1794), which leveled much of New Orleans, the house is actually a product of the preceding fire of 1788. The structures on the site in the early 1780s were partially destroyed by that conflagration and the current structure was rebuilt in the same French colonial fashion six months later. Baton Rouge Capitol Park Museum ‚Äì Baton Rouge The Capitol Park Museum - Baton Rouge features thematic exhibits on the diverse aspects of Louisiana history, industry, and culture. The museum includes two permanent exhibitions, entitled \\"Grounds for Greatness: Louisiana and the Nation,\\" and \\"Experiencing Louisiana: Discovering the Soul of America.\\" Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame & Northwest Louisiana History Museum ‚Äì Natchitoches The Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame & Northwest Louisiana History Museum ‚Äì Natchitoches is the Louisiana State Museum's newest facility.

They have released four full-length albums, one EP, and one split album with The Knife Trade. History The band was formed by Justin Longshore in 2003 after the break-up of a previous group, Tellherisaidgoodbye Their first full-length album was released in 2005 through Prosthetic Records. Shortly before, every member except for Longshore and Gunnels left, with Gunnels also being let go a few months later due to personal reasons. They then added new members which would be known as the 'malice' lineup however, they would also part ways with the band before the 3rd studio album would be released, leaving behind only Jake Ososkie (bass) and Justin Longshore (guitar)remaining. After taking some offtime they regrouped yet again and released their 3rd album 'Skepsis'. The band believes their current lineup is the strongest and that Skepsis represents a mix of everything the band has done and more. The band's influences include Morbid Angel, Blood Has Been Shed, Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse (as suggested by the band's name, possibly taken from the Cannibal Corpse song \\"Staring Through the Eyes of the Dead\\"), Meshuggah, Behemoth, and At the Gates. The band has released three records with Prosthetic Records: Bloodlust in 2005, Malice in 2007, and Skepsis in 2010. Shortly before the US release of Malice, the band shot a music video with acclaimed director David Brodsky at the abandoned mental facility in Kings Park, Long Island, NY. The video went on to be one of the most played videos on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball in 2007 and was chosen as the #7 Video of the Year 2007. It was in the Top 10 Music Choice VOD for nearly 6 months as of April 2008. TTEOTD has been touring extensively supporting the release of Skepsis w/ many national acts including Suffocation, The Faceless, Decrepit Birth, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Otep, Bury Your Dead, Chelsea Grin, The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza, Impending Doom, Whitechapel, Born of Osiris, Periphery, and Greeley Estates to name a few. The band performed on half of 2010's 'thrash n burn' tour as well.

It is named after Jean-Marie Duhamel who first applied the principle to the inhomogeneous heat equation that models, for instance, the distribution of heat in a thin plate which is heated from beneath. For linear evolution equations without spatial dependency, such as a harmonic oscillator, Duhamel's principle reduces to the method of variation of parameters technique for solving linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations.Fritz John, \\"Partial Differential Equations', New York, Springer-Verlag, 1982, 4th ed., 0387906096 The philosophy underlying Duhamel's principle is that it is possible to go from solutions of the Cauchy problem (or initial value problem) to solutions of the inhomogeneous problem. Consider, for instance, the example of the heat equation modeling the distribution of heat energy u in Rn. The initial value problem is : \\\\begin{cases} u_t(x,t) - \\\\Delta u(x,t) = 0 &(x,t)\\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^n\\\\times (0,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\ u(x,0) = g(x) & x\\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^n \\\\end{cases} where g is the initial heat distribution. By contrast, the inhomogeneous problem for the heat equation, : \\\\begin{cases} u_t(x,t) -\\\\Delta u(x,t) = f(x,t) &(x,t)\\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^n\\\\times (0,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\ u(x,0) = 0 & x\\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^n \\\\end{cases} corresponds to adding an external heat energy ∆í(x,t)dt at each point. Intuitively, one can think of the inhomogeneous problem as a set of homogeneous problems each starting afresh at a different time slice t = t0. By linearity, one can add up (integrate) the resulting solutions through time t0 and obtain the solution for the inhomogeneous problem. This is the essence of Duhamel's principle. General considerations Formally, consider a linear inhomogeneous evolution equation for a function :u:D\\\\times(0,\\\\infty)\\\\to \\\\mathbf{R} with spatial domain D in Rn, of the form : \\\\begin{cases} u_t(x,t) -Lu(x,t) = f(x,t) &(x,t)\\\\in D\\\\times (0,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\ u|_{\\\\partial D} = 0 &\\\\\\\\\\\\ u(x,0) = 0 & x\\\\in D, \\\\end{cases} where L is a linear differential operator that involves no time derivatives. Duhamel's principle is, formally, that the solution to this problem is :u(x,t) = \\\\int_0^t (P^sf)(x,t)\\\\,ds where Ps∆í is the solution of the problem : \\\\begin{cases} u_t - Lu = 0 & (x,t)\\\\in D\\\\times (s,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\ u|_{\\\\partial D} = 0 &\\\\\\\\\\\\ u(x,s) = f(x,s) & x\\\\in D. \\\\end{cases} The integrand is the retarded solution P^sf, evaluated at time t, representing the effect, at the later time t, of an infinitesimal force f(x,s)\\\\,ds applied at time s. Duhamel's principle also holds for linear systems (with vector- valued functions u), and this in turn furnishes a generalization to higher t derivatives, such as those appearing in the wave equation (see below). Validity of the principle depends on being able to solve the homogeneous problem in an appropriate function space and that the solution should exhibit reasonable dependence on parameters so that the integral is well-defined. Precise analytic conditions on u and f depend on the particular application. Examples Wave equation The linear wave equation models the displacement u of an idealized dispersionless one-dimensional string, in terms of derivatives with respect to time t and space x: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2}-c^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}=f(x,t). The function f(x,t), in natural units, represents an external force applied to string at the position (x,t). In order to be a suitable physical model for nature, it should be possible to solve it for any initial state that the string is in, specified by its initial displacement and velocity: :u(x,0)=u_0(x),\\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}(x,0)=v_0(x). More generally, we should be able to solve the equation with data specified on any t = constant slice: :u(x,T)=u_T(x),\\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}(x,T)=v_T(x). To evolve a solution from any given time slice T to T+dT, the contribution of the force must be added to the solution. That contribution comes from changing the velocity of the string by f(x,T)dT. That is, to get the solution at time T+dT from the solution at time T, we must add to it a new (forward) solution of the homogeneous (no external forces) wave equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 U}{\\\\partial t^2}-c^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 U}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 with the initial conditions :U(x,T)=0,\\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial t}(x,T)=f(x,T)dT. A solution to this equation is achieved by straightforward integration: : U(x,t) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2c}\\\\int_{x-c(t-T)}^{x+c(t-T)} f(\\\\xi,T)\\\\,d\\\\xi\\\\right)\\\\,dT (The expression in parenthesis is just P^Tf(x,t) in the notation of the general method above.) So a solution of the original initial value problem is obtained by starting with a solution to the problem with the same prescribed initial values problem but with zero initial displacement, and adding to that (integrating) the contributions from the added force in the time intervals from T to T+dT: :u(x,t) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[u_0(x+ct)+ u_0(x-ct)\\\\right]+ \\\\frac{1}{2c}\\\\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} v_0(y) dy + \\\\frac{1}{2c}\\\\int_0^t\\\\int_{x-c(t-T)}^{x+c(t-T)} f(\\\\xi,T)\\\\,d\\\\xi\\\\,dT. Constant-coefficient linear ODE Duhamel's principle is the result that the solution to an inhomogeneous, linear, partial differential equation can be solved by first finding the solution for a step input, and then superposing using Duhamel's integral. Suppose we have a constant coefficient, mth order inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation. : P(\\\\partial_t)u(t) = F(t) : \\\\partial_t^j u(0) = 0, \\\\; 0 \\\\leq j \\\\leq m-1 where : P(\\\\partial_t) := a_m \\\\partial_t^m + \\\\cdots + a_1 \\\\partial_t + a_0,\\\\; a_m eq 0. We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined. First let G solve : P(\\\\partial_t)G = 0, \\\\; \\\\partial^j_t G(0) = 0, \\\\quad 0\\\\leq j \\\\leq m-2, \\\\; \\\\partial_t^{m-1} G(0) = 1/a_m. Define H = G \\\\chi_{[0,\\\\infty)} , with \\\\chi_{[0,\\\\infty)} being the characteristic function of the interval [0,\\\\infty). Then we have : P(\\\\partial_t) H = \\\\delta in the sense of distributions. Therefore : u(t) = (H \\\\ast F)(t) : = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty G(\\\\tau)F(t-\\\\tau)\\\\,d\\\\tau : = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^t G(t-\\\\tau)F(\\\\tau)\\\\, d\\\\tau solves the ODE. Constant-coefficient linear PDE More generally, suppose we have a constant coefficient inhomogeneous partial differential equation : P(\\\\partial_t,D_x)u(t,x) = F(t,x) where : D_x = \\\\frac{1}{i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}. We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined. First, taking the Fourier transform in x we have : P(\\\\partial_t,\\\\xi)\\\\hat u(t,\\\\xi) = \\\\hat F(t,\\\\xi). Assume that P(\\\\partial_t,\\\\xi) is an mth order ODE in t. Let a_m be the coefficient of the highest order term of P(\\\\partial_t,\\\\xi) . Now for every \\\\xi let G(t,\\\\xi) solve : P(\\\\partial_t,\\\\xi)G(t,\\\\xi) = 0, \\\\; \\\\partial^j_t G(0,\\\\xi) = 0 \\\\; \\\\mbox{ for } 0\\\\leq j \\\\leq m-2, \\\\; \\\\partial_t^{m-1} G(0,\\\\xi) = 1/a_m. Define H(t,\\\\xi) = G(t,\\\\xi) \\\\chi_{[0,\\\\infty)}(t) . We then have : P(\\\\partial_t,\\\\xi) H(t,\\\\xi) = \\\\delta(t) in the sense of distributions. Therefore : \\\\hat u(t,\\\\xi) = (H(\\\\cdot,\\\\xi) \\\\ast \\\\hat F(\\\\cdot,\\\\xi))(t) : = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty G(\\\\tau,\\\\xi) \\\\hat F(t-\\\\tau,\\\\xi)\\\\,d\\\\tau : = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^t G(t-\\\\tau,\\\\xi) \\\\hat F(\\\\tau,\\\\xi)\\\\, d\\\\tau solves the PDE (after transforming back to x).

Looking down on downtown Tempe from the butte. Tempe Butte () is the official name of an andesite butte of volcanic origin, located partially on Arizona State University's Tempe campus in Tempe, Arizona. It is often referred to by locals as A Mountain, after the gold-painted letter 'A' near the top. Another name for the area, used by the City of Tempe, is Hayden Butte. The highest point of Tempe Butte stands at in elevation, while its base is at approximately in elevation. Tempe Butte is most often seen as the backdrop to games held in Sun Devil Stadium, including until recently the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, as well as Super Bowl XXX. Geography Originally, Tempe Butte was part of a series of horizontal layers, but the strata has been tilted associated with the formation of South Mountain, and millennia of erosion has created the distinctive hogback of resistant andesite, over sedimentary deposits and rhyolite beds. Despite intensive development, the butte and its immediate surroundings continue to support a variety of native vegetation, including saguaro, buckhorn cholla, barrel cactus, creosote bush, wolfberry, mormon tea, sweetbush, desert lavender, California buckwheat catclaw acacia, palo verde and mesquite. Springtime annuals include Coulter's and Arizona lupine (Lupinus sparsiflorus and Lupinus arizonicus), Coulter's globemallow (Sphaeralcea coulteri), popcorn flowers (Cryptantha), fiddlenecks (Amsinckia), heliotropes (Phacelia), blonde plantain (Plantago ovata) and others. During the summer wild buckwheat (Eriogonum deflexum) blooms, leaving behind a \\"skeleton\\" in the fall. The five-winged spiderling (Boerhavia intermedia) then becomes the dominant annual on this preserve and in neighboring Tempe. Native wildlife include jackrabbits, and small desert- adapted species such as pack rats. History Signs of early habitation by the Hohokam people have been found on Tempe Butte, including petroglyphs, pot shards, scrapers, and metate. The area just west of the butte would be settled by the 1870s in an area first known as Hayden's Ferry, then a major crossing for the Salt River which flows just north of the butte. The proximity of the community to the butte prompted Darrell Duppa to fancifully compare the area to the Vale of Tempe near Mount Olympus in Greece; therefore, the town was given its present name. The remains of the Hayden Flour Mill (which lends its name to main thoroughfare Mill Avenue) still stand near the western edge of the butte. More recent alterations include two water tanks on the south flank of the butte, and several trails, at least one paved, to provide access to man-made structures. The east side of the butte was partially excavated in order to accommodate the construction of Sun Devil Stadium in 1958. A radio tower was built on the top of the mountain in 1962 for the Salt River Project. In May of 2019 all towers and related materials were removed permanently by the city of Tempe. Recent development along the adjacent stretch of the Salt River (which has been dammed to form Tempe Town Lake) has prompted several grassroots movements to preserve the butte from further environmental damage. Capital \\"A\\" Originally, the letter on Tempe Butte was an 'N', built by Tempe Normal School's class of 1918. The school changed its name to Tempe State Teacher's College in 1925, and the 'N' was adapted into a 'T'. Subsequently, three years later, the school would change its name again to Arizona State Teacher's College. It wasn't until 1938 that an ‚ÄúA‚Äù first appeared. It was formed from loose rocks and soon after, the fall ritual of whitewashing the \\"A\\" began. In 1952, vandals with dynamite completely destroyed the \\"A.\\" Today's \\"A,\\" made of reinforced steel and poured concrete, was built in 1955. It is 60 feet from its base to its top. Due to the existence of an \\"A Mountain\\" for the University of Arizona (Sentinel Peak) which predates the \\"A\\" on Tempe Butte, students from these rival schools often attempt to paint the other's 'A' in their school colors. Guarding the A is an annual ritual in the week leading up to the annual ASU-UA football game, the Territorial Cup. The A has been painted in other colors for various causes, and is painted white at the beginning of each school year, but is usually painted Gold, one of ASU's school colors. Most recently, UA students painted the A red and blue in November 2014, three weeks prior to their rivalry game. The A has also been painted colors by other schools, such as green by Oregon Ducks fans and purple by Grand Canyon University fans.

The name of this tribe, the Saxons (Latin: Saxones), was first mentioned by the Greek author Ptolemy. The name Saxons is derived from the Seax, a knife used by the tribe as a weapon. In 3rd and 4th century Germany, great tribal confederations of the Alamanni, Bavarians, Thuringians, Franks, Frisii, and Saxons arose. These took the place of the numerous petty tribes with their popular tribal form of government. With the exceptions of the Saxons, all these confederations were ruled by kings; the Saxons were divided into a number of independent bodies under different chiefs, and in time of war these chieftains drew lots. The selected leader was followed by the other chiefs until the war ended.See pages 182 and 183 of Turner (1852). In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Saxons fought their way victoriously towards the west, and their name was given to the great tribal confederation that stretched towards the west exactly to the former boundary of the Roman Empire, consequently almost to the Rhine. Only a small strip of land on the right bank of the Rhine remained to the Frankish tribe. Towards the south the Saxons pushed as far as the Harz Mountains and the Eichsfeld, and in the succeeding centuries absorbed the greater part of Thuringia. In the east their power extended at first as far as the Elbe and Saale Rivers; in the later centuries it certainly extended much farther. All the coast of the German Ocean belonged to the Saxons except that west of the Weser, which the Frisians retained. Saxons and Christianity The history of the powerful Saxon tribe is also the history of the conversion to Christianity of that part of Germany which lies between the Rhine and the Oder, that is of almost the whole of the present Northern Germany. From the 8th century, the Saxons were divided into the four subdivisions (gau): Westphalians, between the Rhine and Weser; the Engern or Angrians, on both sides of the Weser; the Eastphalians, between the Weser and Elbe; the Transalbingians, in the present Holstein. The only one of these names that has been preserved is Westphalians, given to the inhabitants of the Prussian Province of Westphalia. In company with the tribe of Angles from Schleswig, a part of the Saxons settled on the island of Britain from which the Romans had withdrawn, where, as Anglo-Saxons, after having accepted Christianity about 600, they laid the foundation of Anglo-Saxon civilisation and the present Great Britain. In attempting to reach Gaul by land the Saxons came into violent conflict with the Franks living on the Rhine. The Frankish king Clovis I (481-511) united the various Frankish tribes, conquered Roman Gaul, and with his people accepted Christianity. The new Frankish kingdom was able to bring all German tribes except the Saxons under its authority and to make them Christian. For more than a hundred years there was almost uninterrupted warfare between Frank and Saxon. Many Anglo-Saxon Christian missionaries sought to convert the Saxons, some were killed, some driven away; the names of only a few of these men have been preserved, as St. Suitbert, St. Egnert, the saint called Brother Ewald, St. Lebuin, etc. St. Boniface also preached without success among the Saxons. 870 Saxony. After a bloody struggle that lasted thirty years (772-804), the Saxons were finally brought under Frankish supremacy by the great Frankish ruler, Charlemagne. The earliest date at which it can be proved that Charlemagne had the conquest of the Saxon districts in view is 776. Charlemagne was also able to win them to Christianity, the Saxons being the last German tribe that still held persistently to belief in the Germanic gods. At different times the Saxon wars of Charlemagne have been called \\"religious wars.\\" The assertion, which cannot be proved, has been made that Pope Adrian I had called upon Charlemagne to convert the Saxons by force. Charlemagne's campaigns were intended mainly to punish the Saxons for their annual marauding expeditions to the Rhine, in which they burned churches and monasteries, killed the priests, and sacrificed their prisoners of war to the gods. At the same time it is true that various measures taken by Charlemagne, as the execution of 4,500 Saxons at Verden in 782 and the hard laws issued to the subjugated, were shortsighted and cruel. It was believed that if peace was to be permanent the overthrow of the Saxons must be accompanied by their conversion to Christianity. The work of converting Saxony was given to St. Sturmi, who was on terms of friendship with Charlemagne, and the monks of the monastery of Fulda founded by Sturmi. Among the successful missionaries were also St. Willehad, the first bishop of Bremen, and his Anglo-Saxon companions. After St. Sturmi's death (779) the country of the Saxons was divided into missionary districts, and each of these placed under a Frankish bishop. Parishes were established within the old judicial districts. With the generous aid of Charlemagne and his nobles large numbers of churches and monasteries were founded, and as soon as peace and quiet had been re-established in the different districts, permanent dioceses were founded. Although the opposition in Saxon territories to Christian teaching had been obstinate only a few decades before, the Saxons grew accustomed to the new system. Medieval Duchy of Saxony and Duchy of Saxe- Wittenberg (880‚Äì1356) When the Frankish kingdom was divided by the Treaty of Verdun (843) the territory east of the Rhine became the East Frankish Kingdom, from which the present Germany has developed. A strong central authority was lacking during the reigns of the weak East Frankish kings of the Carolingian dynasty. Each German tribe was forced to rely upon itself for defence against the incursions of the Norsemen from the north and of the Slavs from the east, consequently the tribes once more chose dukes as rulers. The first Saxon duke was Otto the Illustrious (880-912) of the Liudolfinger line (descendants of Liudolf); Otto was able to extend his power over Thuringia. Otto's son Henry was elected king of Germany (919-936); Henry is justly called the real founder of the German Empire. His son Otto I (936-973) was the first non-Carolingian German king to receive from the pope the imperial Roman crown (962). Otto I was followed as king and emperor by his son Otto II (973-983), who was succeeded by his son Otto III (983-1002); both the kings last mentioned vainly endeavoured to establish German authority in Italy. The line of Saxon emperors expired with Henry II (1002‚Äì1024), who was canonized in 1146. Henry I had been both King of Germany and Duke of Saxony at the same time. Mainly for the sake of his ducal possessions he had carried on a long and difficult struggle with the Slavs on the eastern boundary of his country. The Emperor Otto I was also for the greater part of his reign Duke of Saxony. Otto I brought the Slavonic territory on the right bank of the Elbe and Saale under German supremacy and Christian civilization. He divided the region he had acquired into several margraviates, the most important being: the North Mark, out of which in the course of time the Kingdom of Prussia developed, and the Margraviate of Meissen, from which sprang the Kingdom of Saxony. Each mark was divided into districts, not only for military and political purposes but also for ecclesiastical: the central point of each district was a fortified castle. The first churches built near these castles were plain buildings of wood or rubble-stone. Otto I laid the basis of the organization of the Church in this territory by making the chief fortified places which he established in the different marks the sees of dioceses. The Byzantine emperors also aided much in bringing to Christianity the great Slavonic people, the Poles, who lived on the right bank of the Oder, as for a time the Polish country was under German suzerainty. The beginnings of Christian civilization among the Slavs were largely destroyed by the Slavonic rebellions in the years 980 and 1060. In 960 Otto I had transferred the ducal authority over Saxony to a Count Hermann, who had distinguished himself in the struggle with the Slavs, and the ducal title became hereditary in Count Hermann's family. This old Duchy of Saxony, as it is called in distinction from the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg, became the centre of the opposition of the German princes to the imperial power during the era of the Franconian or Salian emperors. With the death of Duke Magnus in 1106 the Saxon ducal family, frequently called the Billung line, became extinct. The Emperor Henry V (1106‚Äì25) gave the Duchy of Saxony in fief to Count Lothair of Supplinburg, who in 1125 became King of Germany, and at his death (1137) transferred the Duchy of Saxony to his son-in-law, Duke Henry the Proud, of the princely family of the Welf (Guelph). The hundred years of war waged by the family of Guelph with the Hohenstaufen emperors is famous in history. The son of Henry the Proud (died 1139) was Henry the Lion (died 1195), who extended German authority and Christianity into the present Mecklenburg and Pomerania, and re-established Christianity in the territories devastated by the Slavonic revolts. Henry the Lion refused to aid the Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in his campaign against the cities of Lombardy in 1176, consequently in 1180 the ban of the empire was proclaimed against Henry at W√ºrzburg, and 1181 the old Duchy of Saxony was cut up at the Diet of Gelnhausen into many small portions. The greater share of its western portion was given, as the Duchy of Westphalia, to the Archbishopric of Cologne. The Saxon bishops, who had before this possessed sovereign authority in their territories, though under the suzerainty of the Duke of Saxony, gained imperial immediacy subject only to the imperial government;Thus the Saxon (arch)bishops turned into prince-(arch)bishops, such as the Prince-Archbishops of Bremen and Magdeburg, and the prince-bishops of Halberstadt, L√ºbeck, Ratzeburg, Schwerin as well as Verden etc. the case was the same with a large number of secular counties and cities. The Diet of Gelnhausen is of much importance in the history of Germany. The Emperor Frederick executed here a great legal act. Yet the splitting up of the extensive country of the Saxons into a large number of principalities subject only to the imperial government was one of the causes of the system of petty states which proved so disadvantageous to Germany in its later history. The territory of the old duchy never again bore the name of Saxony; the large western part acquired the name of Westphalia. However, as regards customs and peculiarities of speech, the designation Lower Saxony was still in existence for the districts on the lower Elbe, that is, the northern part of the Province of Saxony, Hanover, Hamburg, etc., in distinction from Upper Saxony, that is, the Kingdom of Saxony, and Thuringia. From the era of the conversion of the Saxons up to the revolt of the 16th century, a rich religious life was developed in the territory included in the medieval Duchy of Saxony. Art, learning, poetry, and the writing of history reached a high degree of perfection in the many monasteries. Among the most noted places of learning were the cathedral and monastery schools of Corvey, Hildesheim, Paderborn and M√ºnster. This era produced architecturally fine churches of the Romanesque style that are still in existence, as the cathedrals of Goslar, Soest and Brunswick, the chapel of St. Bartholomew at Paderborn, the collegiate churches at Quedlinburg, K√∂nigslutter, Gernrode, etc. Hildesheim, which contains much Romanesque work, has especially fine churches of this style. The cathedrals at Naumburg, Paderborn, M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck are striking examples of the Transition period. Only a few of these buildings still belong to the Catholic Church. Electorate of Saxony (1356‚Äì1806) Kings of Poland and Electors of Saxony; Augustus II in the foreground and Augustus III behind him as depicted on F√ºrstenzug mural in Dresden The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century began under the protection of the electors of Saxony -- in 1517, Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses at the castle church of Wittenberg. The electorate remained a focal point of religious strife throughout the Reformation and to the subsequent Thirty Years' War. After the dissolution of the medieval Duchy of Saxony, the name Saxony was first applied to a small part of the duchy situated on the Elbe around the city of Wittenberg. When in 1356 the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV issued the Golden Bull, the fundamental law of the empire which settled the method of electing the emperor, the Duchy of Saxe- Wittenberg was made one of the seven electorates and promoted to become the Electorate of Saxony. This lent influence out of proportion to the small area of the state. In addition, electoral status required succession based on primogeniture, which precluded the division of the territory among several heirs and the consequent disintegration of the country. Following the Thirty Years' War, Saxony's rulers and population were Lutheran. However, in the 18th century Frederick Augustus I converted to Roman Catholicism to be crowned King of Poland as Augustus II. The Polish-Saxon union and dual state continued until the death of Augustus III in 1763. Throughout this time, the population of Saxony remained largely Protestant. In 1756, Saxony joined the coalition of Austria, France and Russia against Prussia. Frederick II of Prussia chose to attack preemptively and invaded Saxony in August 1756, precipitating the Seven Years' War. The Prussians quickly defeated Saxony and incorporated the Saxon army into the Prussian army. They made the mistake of keeping their units intact rather than mixing them up. Whole Saxon units deserted. At the end of the Seven Years' War, Saxony once again became an independent state. When in 1806 Napoleon I's French Empire began a war with Prussia, Saxony at first allied itself to Prussia, but afterwards joined Napoleon and entered the Confederation of the Rhine and the electorate became the Kingdom of Saxony with Elector Frederick Augustus III becoming King Frederick Augustus I. Kingdom of Saxony (1806‚Äì1918) Kingdom of Saxony in 1895 The new kingdom was an ally of France in all the Napoleonic wars of the years 1807‚Äì13. At the beginning of the great German Campaign of 1813 the king sided neither with Napoleon nor with his allied opponents, but united his troops with those of France when Napoleon threatened to treat Saxony as a hostile country. At the Battle of Leipzig (16‚Äì18 October 1813), when Napoleon was completely defeated, the greater part of the Saxon troops deserted to the allied forces. The King of Saxony was taken as a Prussian prisoner to the Castle of Friedrichsfeld near Berlin. The Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì15) took from Saxony the greater part of its land and gave it to Prussia, namely with about 850,000 inhabitants; this ceded territory included the former Duchy of Saxe- Wittenberg, the former possessions of the Dioceses of Merseburg and Naumburg, a large part of Lusatia, etc. What Prussia had obtained, with the addition of some old Prussian districts, was formed into the Province of Saxony. The Kingdom of Saxony had left only an area of with a population at that era of 1,500,000 inhabitants; under these conditions it became a member of the German Confederation that was founded in 1815. King John (1854‚Äì73) sided with Austria in the struggle between Prussia and Austria as to the supremacy in Germany. Consequently, in the War of 1866, when Prussia was successful, the independence of Saxony was once more in danger; only the intervention of the Austrian Emperor saved Saxony from being entirely absorbed by Prussia. The kingdom, however, was obliged to join the North German Confederation of which Prussia was the head. In 1871 Saxony became one of the states of the newly founded German Empire. King John was followed by his son King Albert (1873‚Äì1902); Albert was succeeded by his brother George (1902‚Äì04); the son of George is King Frederick Augustus III. Prince Maximilian (born 1870), a brother of the present king, became a priest in 1896, was engaged in parish work in London and Nuremberg, and since 1900 has been a professor of canon law and liturgy in the University of Freiburg in Switzerland. The Kingdom of Saxony is the fifth state of the German Empire in area and third in population; in 1905 the average population per square mile was 778.8. Saxony is the most densely peopled state of the empire, and indeed of all Europe; the reason is the very large immigration on account of the development of manufactures. In 1910 the population amounted to 5,302,485; of whom 218,033 were Catholics; 4,250,398 Evangelical Lutherans; 14,697 Jews; and a small proportion of other denominations. The Catholic population of Saxony owes its present numbers largely to immigration during the 19th century. Catholicism that can be traced back to the period before the Reformation is found only in one section, the governmental department of Bautzen. Even here there is no continuous Catholic district, but there are a number of villages where the population is almost entirely Catholic, and two cities (Ostritz and Schirgiswalde) where Catholics are in the majority. It should also be mentioned that about 1.5 of the inhabitants of Saxony consists of the remains of a Slavonic tribe called by the Germans Wends, and in their own language \\"Serbjo\\". These Wends, who number about 120,000 persons and live in Saxon and Prussian Lusatia, are entirely surrounded by a German population; consequently owing to German influence the Wendic language, manners, and customs are gradually disappearing. About 50,000 Wends live in the Kingdom of Saxony; of these about 12,000 belong to the Catholic Church; some fifty Wendic villages are entirely Catholic. There is also a large Wendic population in the city of Bautzen, where among 30,000 inhabitants 7,000 are Wends. After 1918 Saxony in 1930 After 1918 Saxony was a state in the Weimar Republic and was the scene of Gustav Stresemann's overthrow of the KPD/SPD led government in 1923. It continued to exist during the Nazi era and under Soviet occupation. It was dissolved in 1952, and divided into three smaller 'Bezirke' based on Leipzig, Dresden and Karl-Marx-Stadt, but reestablished within slightly altered borders in 1990 upon German reunification. Today the Free State of Saxony also includes a small part of former prussian Silesia around the town of G√∂rlitz which remained German after the war and which for obvious reasons of unviability as a separate state was incorporated into Saxony. This part had been part of Silesia only after 1815 and belonged as part of Upper Lusatia to Bohemia before 1623 and previously to Saxony between 1623 and 1815. Prussian province of Saxony The province had an area of , and in 1905 had 2,979,221 inhabitants. Of its population 230,860 (7.8%) were Catholic, 2,730,098 (91%) were Protestant; 9981 hold other forms of Christian faith, and 8050 were Jews. During the summer months about 15,000 to 20,000 Catholic labourers, called Sachseng√§nger, came into the country; they were Poles from the Prussian Province of Posen, from Russian Poland, or Galicia. The province was divided into the three government departments of Magdeburg, Merseburg and Erfurt. The Prussian Province of Saxony was formed in 1815 from the territories, about in extent, ceded by the Kingdom of Saxony, with the addition of some districts already belonging to Prussia, the most important of which are the Altmark, from which the State of Prussia sprang; the former immediate principalities of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and of the Bishopric of Halberstadt, which Prussia had received by the Peace of Westphalia (1648) at the close of the Thirty Years' War; and the Eichsfeld, with the city of Erfurt and its surroundings. Up to 1802 the Eichsfeld and Erfurt had belonged to the principality of the Archbishopric of Mainz; a large of the population had, therefore, retained the Catholic Faith during the Reformation. As regards ecclesiastical affairs the Province of Saxony had been assigned to the Diocese of Paderborn by the papal bull De salute animarum of 16 July 1821. The province contained three ecclesiastical administrative divisions: the episcopal commissariat of Magdeburg that embraced the entire governmental department of Magdeburg and consisted of four deaneries and 25 parishes; the \\"ecclesiastical Court\\" of Erfurt, which included the governmental Department of Merseburg and the eastern half of the governmental Department of Erfurt; and consisted of 2 deaneries (Halle and Erfurt) and 28 parishes; the episcopal commissariat of Heiligenstadt, which embraceed the western half of the governmental department of Erfurt, that is called the Upper Eichsfeld, and consisted of 16 deaneries and 129 parishes. In those parts of the governmental Department of Magdeburg which belonged originally to the former Archdiocese of Magdeburg and the Diocese of Halberstadt all Catholic life was not entirely destroyed during the Reformation. Besides fourteen monasteries that continued in existence, there were in Halberstadt a number of benefices in connexion with the cathedral and the collegiate Church of Sts. Peter and Paul. As the entire native population had become Protestant these monasteries were only maintained by the immigration of Catholics who, from the time of the Treaty of Westphalia, though in small numbers, steadily came into the country; thus there arose around the monasteries small Catholic communities. The monasteries were all suppressed during the great secularization of the beginning of the 19th century, and thirteen parishes were formed, for which the State provided a fund from a part of the property of the monasteries. The other parishes in the governmental Department of Magdeburg were created after the middle of the 19th century, when, in consequence of the development of the manufacture of sugar, increasing numbers of Catholics came into the country; the St. Boniface Association gave the money to found these parishes.

Employing synecdoche, Kipling uses his poem to expose the terrible hardship faced in old age by veterans of the Crimean War, as exemplified by the cavalry men of the light brigade who charged at the Battle of Balaclava. It describes a visit by the last twenty survivors of the charge to Tennyson (then in his eightieth year) to reproach him gently for not writing a sequel about the way in which England was treating its old soldiers. Some sources treat the poem as an account of a real event, but other commentators class the destitute old soldiers as allegorical, with the visit invented by Kipling to draw attention to the poverty in which the real survivors were living, in the same way that he evoked Tommy Atkins in \\"The Absent Minded Beggar\\". Reception Unlike Tennyson's poem, and like first- person accounts of the Light Brigade, Kipling's poem was largely ignored.

It specialises in small scale and microfinance style borrowing from and lending to its approximately 30 million retail clients through its over 4,000 branches, units and rural service posts. It also has a comparatively small, but growing, corporate business. As of 2010 it is the second largest bank in Indonesia by asset. BRI is the oldest bank in Indonesia, tracing back since 1896. It is currently 70% government owned operating company (Persero) and has been government-owned for the entire period since the war of independence (1945 to 1949) to November 2003, when 30% of its shares were sold through an IPO. History BRI was founded in 1895, during the Dutch colonial period as De Poerwokertosche Hulp en Spaarbank der Inlandsche Hoofden (Help and Savings Bank for Purwokerto's Aristocrats) by Raden Bei Aria Wirjaatmadja in Purwokerto, Central Java.Investor Relations: Corporate Profile, Bank Rakyat Indonesia's investor relations site. Retrieved 24 November 2014. It then underwent its first (of many) name changes to Hulp en Spaarbank der Inlandsche Bestuurs Ambtenaren (Help and Savings Bank for Local Civil Servants). Going through several name changes, its final name during the colonial period was Algemene Volkscredietbank (People's General Credit Bank, AVB) in 1934. This translates loosely into Indonesian as Bank Rakyat Serikat. At this point it was one of the largest institutions in the (then) colony. The bank's operations were affected by the Japanese occupation during the 1942 to 1945 period of World War II, including a further name change to Shomin Ginkou (People's Bank). After the Indonesian declaration of independence, on 17 August 1945 the bank was officially nationalised by the new government and then renamed Bank Rakyat Indonesia Serikat. BRI gained its current name and status in 1992. BRI was nearly unique in Indonesia in the East Asian financial crisis of 1997, in that its operations were largely unaffected. This was because it had very little, if any, lending in foreign currencies or to the large corporations that had been borrowing heavily overseas, as most of the other large Indonesian banks had. Since then BRI has been concentrating on increasing its core business and improving its risk management practices. As part of the reformasi (reform) process in Indonesia since 1998, the government has been steadily reducing its influence on the Bank's day-to-day operations, culminating in its IPO. It is also seeking to comply with the Basel II accords, as mandated by Bank Indonesia, by 2008. During period of 2006‚Äì2011, its assets jumped almost 62%. The bank topped the list of the nation's most profitable banks for six years, recording assets of Rp 249.56 trillion (US$28.6 billion) in 2010, up from Rp 154.72 trillion in 2006. In April 2014, BRI contracted with Space Systems/Loral and Arianespace to, respectively, build and launch their first satellite, a C- and Ku-band spacecraft dubbed BRIsat, and on 18 June 2016, Ariane 5 has successfully launched BRIsat as the first satellite owned and operated by a bank in the world to link the bank's geographically isolated branches.

Pecini Vene, in Le glorie degli Incogniti Claudio Achillini (Latin Claudius Achillinus; 18 September 1574 ‚Äì 1 October 1640) was an Italian philosopher, theologian, mathematician, poet, and jurist. Born in Bologna, he was grandson to Giovanni Filoteo Achillini and grand-nephew to Alessandro Achillini. He was professor of jurisprudence for several years at his native Bologna, Parma, and Ferrara, with the highest reputation. So much admiration did his learning excite, that inscriptions to his honor were placed in the schools in his lifetime. He was a member of a number of learned and literary societies, including the Accademia dei Lincei. Achillini went to Rome, where he obtained great promises of preferment from popes and cardinals, but they proved only promises. Odoardo Farnese, duke of Parma, engaged him however on very liberal terms, to occupy the chair of law in his university. Achillini was a particular friend of Giambattista Marino, whose style in poetry he imitated, adopting the same strain of turgid metaphors, absurd thoughts, and points, which obtained the applause of that age. A canzone, which he addressed to Louis XIII on the birth of the dauphin, is said to have been rewarded by Cardinal Richelieu with a gold chain or collar worth 1000 crowns; this reward was not given, as some have asserted, for the famous sonnet beginning, \\"Sudate o fuochi, a preparar metalli;\\" and which was parodied by Crudeli in one beginning, \\"Sudate o forni, a preparar pagnotte,\\" (Sweat, O ye ovens! in preparing cakes!) Achillini's poems were published at Bologna in 1632. He also printed a volume of Latin letters.

He missed the honour of claiming the first ascent of Mount Cook, which was achieved a few months earlier, on Christmas Day 1894 by a party of New Zealanders who were determined to prevent the first ascent being credited to a foreigner.  Personal life  Later in life, his fortune declined. He lived his last decade as a vagrant in his home country, and was found hanged in Geneva in 1917, an apparent suicide.

The legal owner (i.e. the owner on the record) may be described as the \\"registered owner\\", and if they are not the beneficial owner they may be described as a \\"nominee\\". Definition According to a March 2019 Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) report, beneficial owners are \\"always natural persons who ultimately own or control a legal entity or arrangement, such as a company, a trust, a foundation\\". According to the United States' Securities Exchange Act, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, has or shares voting or investment power. The terms ‚Äòultimately owns or controls‚Äô and ‚Äòultimate effective control‚Äô refer to situations in which ownership/control is exercised through a chain of ownership or by means of control other than direct control. The FATF recommendations are recognised as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. According to the Vancouver, BC-based Trulioo, the process of identifying UBOs (Ultimate Beneficial Ownership)'s includes acquiring and verifying a company's \\"accurate company \\"information regarding register number, company name, address, status, and key management personnel\\"; analyzing \\"ownership structure and percentages\\", \\"determining the \\"entities or natural-persons who have an ownership stake, either through direct ownership or through another party\\"; identifying beneficial owners: and calculating the \\"total ownership stake, or management control, of any natural-person and determine if it crosses the threshold for UBO reporting\\" and \\"perform AML (anti money laundering)/KYC (know your customer) checks for all individuals determined to be a UBO\\". International standards Determining beneficial ownership information is a requirement of the 4th AML Directive in Europe and different jurisdictions are passing enabling laws to enforce reporting requirements. In the US, similar beneficial ownership disclosures are a part of the FinCEN Customer Due Diligence Final Rule effective from May 11, 2018. The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS) has been developed to serve as a conceptual and practical framework for collecting and publishing beneficial ownership data, and enabling the resulting data to be interoperable, more easily reused, and higher quality. The Standard (BODS) provides a specification for modelling and publishing information on the beneficial ownership and control of companies. It was created by OpenOwnership, and is provided under an open license for re-use. OpenOwnership is supporting the development of the Standard; however, the Standard retains its own independent governance through the working group of international experts. Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an independent inter-governmental body that develops and promotes policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering and terrorist financing, that was established in 1989, sets international standards related to beneficial ownership, including how beneficial ownership is defined. The FATF refers to a \\"beneficial owner\\" as the natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a legal entity and/or the natural person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. It also includes those persons who exercise ultimate effective control over a legal person or arrangement. By 2001, FATF had compiled and maintained a \\"Black List\\" of non-cooperative countries or territories. OECD's \\"Ownership and Control of Ships\\" According to the OECD's 2003 December report, entitled \\"Ownership and Control of Ships\\", corporate structures are often multi- layered, spread across numerous jurisdictions, and make the beneficial owner \\"almost impenetrable\\" to law enforcement officials and taxation. The OECD's Maritime Transport Committee Secretariat had initiated an investigation at its January 2003 meeting. The report concludes that \\"regardless of the reasons why the cloak of anonymity is made available, if it is provided it will also assist those who may wish to remain hidden because they engage in illegal or criminal activities, including terrorists.\\" The OECD report concludes that the use of bearer shares is \\"perhaps the single most important (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism\\" to protect the anonymity of a ship's beneficial owner.Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \\"Ownership and Control of Ships\\", OECD 2003, p. 8. Physically possessing a bearer share accords ownership of the corporation. There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer shares, and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded. Two similar techniques to provide anonymity for a ship's beneficial owner are \\"nominee shareholders\\" and \\"nominee directors.\\" The 2003 OECD report said that, in some jurisdictions that require shareholder identities to be reported, a loophole may exist where the beneficial owner may appoint a nominee to be the shareholder, and that nominee cannot legally be compelled to reveal the identity of the beneficial owner.OECD 2003, pp. 8‚Äì9. The 2009 OECD report said that, all corporations are required to have at least one director, however many jurisdictions allow this to be a nominee director.OECD 2009, p. 9. A nominee director's name would appear on all corporate paperwork in place of the beneficial owners, and like nominee shareholders, few jurisdictions can compel a nominee director to divulge the identity of beneficial owners. A further hurdle is that some jurisdictions allow a corporation to be named as a director. The 2003 report clarified that a ship's beneficial owner is legally and financially responsible for the ship and its activities.OECD 2003, p. 4. For any of a number of reasons, some justifiable and some suspicious, shipowners who wish to conceal their ownership may use a number of strategies to achieve that goal. Gianni wrote in 2008 that, in jurisdictions that permit it, actual owners may establish shell corporations to be the legal owners of their ships, making it difficult, if not impossible, to track who is the beneficial owner of the ship. Gianni's 2008 paper cited the 2004 Report of the UN Secretary General's Consultative Group on Flag State Implementation which said that, \\"It is very easy, and comparatively inexpensive, to establish a complex web of corporate entities to provide very effective cover to the identities of beneficial owners who do not want to be known.\\" The OECD's 2011 \\"Board Practices: Incentives and Governing Risks\\" report, cited both the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) 2009 review and the Walker review of the \\"governance of banks and other financial institutions\\" which had \\"found that there were significant concerns about the quantity and effectiveness of engagement between institutional investors and boards of listed companies\\" and that there was a \\"need for better engagement between fund managers acting on behalf of their clients as beneficial owners, and the boards of investee companies'. At that time these reports had \\"recommended that the FRC ratify a \\"Stewardship Code\\" based on the Code on the Responsibilities of Institutional Investors, prepared by the Institutional Shareholders' Committee.\\" Major violations According to a 23 February 2018 article in The Diplomat, in the Ablyazov Affair, involving the ex-Kazakh minister Mukhtar Ablyazov, beneficial ownership was used to fraudulently move $6 billion from Kazakhstan's BTA Bank in what is the largest case of financial fraud in history. Beneficial ownership by country Canada The Canadian federal Department of Finance‚ÄîFinance Canada (FC)‚ÄîFebruary 2018 discussion paper, \\"Reviewing Canada's Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Regime\\", was prepared in preparation for the FC's legislative Parliamentary Review of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), which is the federal legal framework for regulating AML/ATF. The February paper called for \\"stakeholders' views on how to improve the Canadian Anti- Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing regime. FC requested input on \\"corporate ownership transparency and mechanisms\\" that would \\"improve timely access to beneficial ownership information by authorities while maintaining the ease of doing business in Canada.\\" The resulting November 2018 Standing Committee on Finance report, recommended the creation of a \\"pan- Canadian beneficial ownership registry for all legal persons and entities, including trusts, who have significant control which is defined as those having at least 25% of total share ownership or voting rights\\" that would \\"include details such as names, addresses, dates of birth and nationalities of individuals with significant control\\". While the registry \\"should not be publicly accessible\\", it could be \\"accessed by certain law enforcement authorities\\", the Canada Revenue Agency, Canadian Border Services Agency, FINTRAC, \\"authorized reporting entities and other public authorities.\\" The Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada 13 February 2020 report, entitled \\"Strengthening Corporate Beneficial Ownership Transparency in Canada\\", said that the 2016 Panama Papers and Bahamas Leaks and the 2017 Paradise Papers highlighted the \\"scale and ease of use of corporations and other legal entities to evade or avoid taxes and facilitate criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and corruption.\\" The Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA) requires that certain corporations collect information on \\"individuals with significant control\\". The CBCA says that individuals with significant control refer to \\"anyone with direct or indirect ownership or control over a significant number of shares of a corporation (i.e., 25% of the voting rights or fair market value of the outstanding shares), or who has any direct or indirect influence that, if exercised, would result in control in fact of the corporation, among other circumstances\\". This is in line with \\"international standards governing the definition of beneficial ownership, including those set out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\\"  See also  * Beneficial owner  References  Category:Property law Category:Securities (finance) Category:Stock market Category:Ownership External links *Nominee directors and secretarial service.

It was based on the Marvel Comics character and film series, taking place after the events of Blade: Trinity. The show premiered on Spike on June 28, 2006. Sticky Fingaz starred in the title role, along with Jill Wagner as Krista Starr, Neil Jackson as Marcus van Sciver, Jessica Gower as Chase, and Nelson Lee as Shen. New Line Cinema (alongside Warner Bros.) is the distributor of this series as they had the rights for distribution prior to the Disney buyout of Marvel. The two-hour pilot was directed by Peter O'Fallon from a script by David S. Goyer (who wrote the scripts for all three of the films) and Geoff Johns. Plot In the pilot, Krista Starr returns from military service in Iraq to learn that her twin brother, Zack, has died under mysterious circumstances. Her investigation reveals Zack had been a \\"familiar\\" ‚Äì a kind of indentured servant of vampires, who agrees to do their bidding in the hopes his \\"master\\" will eventually reward him with eternal life. Krista's search for her brother's killer leads her to face Blade, as well as Marcus Van Sciver, Zack's killer. Marcus is a powerful vampire and high-ranking member of the House of Chthon. Smitten with Krista, Marcus decides to turn her into a vampire by injecting her with his blood. Krista is then approached by Blade, who injects her with the same serum he uses to control his own vampire instincts, and offers her a chance to help him avenge her brother's death and bring down Marcus and the House of Chthon, and revealed that Zack was trying to do a sting operation with Blade. The two form a reluctant partnership. The remainder of the season follows Krista's attempts to maintain her cover in the House of Chthon, all the while struggling with her growing predatory nature, and Marcus's (supposed) efforts to develop a \\"vaccine\\" that will render vampires immune to all their traditional weaknesses (sunlight, silver, garlic, etc.). It is later revealed that Marcus's true purpose is to create a virus called the Aurora Project that will specifically target \\"purebloods\\", the ruling vampire class, and leave the turnbloods (normal vampires like Chase and Marcus, who were once human) unscathed. With Blade's help, he eventually unleashes his weapon in the series finale. Production In February 2006, Spike TV had given the green light for a television series based on Marvel Comics superhero Blade as the network's first original scripted series. Spike TV executive Pancho Mansfield expressed to AllHipHop.com, \\"We're extremely pleased with the pilot for Blade, which delivers a thrilling action-adventure for its built-in fan base as well as a character-driven drama filled with heart-pounding tension and suspense. The series will be the first of our scripted fare as we embark on creating a greater mix of original programming for our viewers.\\" It was announced on November 7, 2005, that rapper Kirk \\"Sticky Fingaz\\" Jones had signed to star as Blade, filling the role made popular in the films by Wesley Snipes. Sticky would go on to comment that he was not out to make people forget about the Blade films, but he also wanted to put his own spin on the character. \\"I think it's more my own direction, but I have to incorporate some of what [Snipes] did,\\" he said. \\"That's what people are familiar with, and you don't want to change it up drastically. You might want to change the seasoning a little bit, but you want the same meat.\\" Spike TV ordered 11 one-hour episodes, in addition to the two-hour pilot episode, to be produced by New Line Television. Production was said to begin in Vancouver in the spring of 2006 and the show later premi√®red on June 28, 2006 followed by the standard one-hour episodes on July 5, 2006. David S. Goyer, who wrote the scripts for all three of the films and co-created the television series, commented that the open-ended nature of a TV series supported the kind of storytelling that will allow viewers to delve more into the inner workings of the vampire world. The series picked up where the last film, Blade: Trinity, left off and added several new characters, including Jill Wagner as Krista Starr, Neil Jackson as Marcus van Sciver, Jessica Gower as Chase and Nelson Lee as Shen. Goyer later explained, \\"What the series is, in a weird way, is kind of like a Wiseguy with vampires, because Jill's character is kind of a double agent working for Blade, within the vampire community, and [we're] treating the vampires sort of like the ultimate crime family. Blade realizes at the beginning of the pilot that he's not making much headway, just sort of hacking and slashing, that he needs to know more about their inner workings.\\" Film to series chronology The TV series takes place after Blade: Trinity, since certain events in the last film were mentioned in the pilot episode. At the end of Trinity, Blade used the Daystar, a biological weapon that targets and kills vampires specifically; however, the Daystar has not spread as fast or as far as originally designed, as there are still many vampire houses in operation (for example, Marcus, in the second episode, mentions 12 existing vampire Houses to Krista).  Episodes   Cast and characters  Main * Sticky Fingaz as Eric Brooks / Blade **Jon Kent Ethridge as young Eric Brooks * Jill Wagner as Krista Starr * Nelson Lee as Shen * Jessica Gower as Chase * Neil Jackson as Marcus van Sciver  Recurring humans * Robert Brooks (Richard Roundtree, older; Colin Lawrence, young) is the father of Eric Brooks who becomes Blade. After his wife Vanessa was attacked by Deacon Frost and gave birth to their half human, half vampire son, Robert tried to take care of his son despite the hardship of his son's blood craving. Eventually, Eric runs away when he thinks that Robert betrays him. Years later, Blade encounters Robert who tries to make amends with his son for the past, but he coldly rejects him. * Agent Collins (Larry Poindexter) was an FBI agent whose family was killed by a serial killer. He initially was tracking a series of killings linked to Detective Brian Boone when he became aware of the links to vampires. Collins was fired from the FBI by his boss, who was a familiar. After his firing, Collins found Blade and helped him track a downed airplane containing the pureblood Charlotte. Collins was bitten by Charlotte, who tricked him and then bled him. Collins begged Blade to kill him before he turned, which Blade did with a silver stake to the heart. * Cain (Ryan Kennedy), a former familiar, is the single most powerful ash dealer in Detroit. His knowledge of the vampire world has allowed him to easily amass a drug empire through which he makes quite a bit of money. One hit of vampire ash can sell for thousands of dollars, even more if it is from a pureblood. Cain came to Blade's attention through Father Carlyle, who was treating ash addicts at the time. Cain also drew the attention of the House of Chthon by ashing Winston, a high-ranking official that had been sent to ensure that Aurora worked. After an attack on his warehouse by both Blade and the House of Chthon, Cain fled. He was last seen being beaten and questioned by Blade. Rather than kill him however, Blade encouraged him to keep ashing vampires. * Professor Caylo (Randy Quaid) was a disgraced professor whom Krista Starr sought out while investigating her brother's death. She brought him a vial of vampire ash and a drawing of a glyph, he explained to her that her brother was a familiar from the House of Chthon. Professor Caylo also gave her information about the vampire hunter Blade. He was a very paranoid man and a drunk, he forced visitors to expose their arms and necks before entering his house (to check for glyphs) and also kept a large amount of garlic hanging by his door. When Krista asked if he needed a sample of ash for proof, he showed her his hand with missing digits. The name is a reference to Mel Caylo, an editor at Wizard Magazine, a publication that frequently covers series creator Geoff Johns. Quaid was uncredited for his role. * Reverend Carlyle (William MacDonald) was an excommunicated priest who ran a small street ministry catering to drug addicts. Blade went to him for information about ashers, and \\"donated\\" money he took from an ash dealer. Carlyle did not approve of Blade's methods, and had him kidnapped by the Bad Bloods. The father tried to reason with Blade and talk him out of killing, but was himself killed by the Bloods after they got Blade and no longer needed the Father. * Officer Donny Flannigan (Peter Hall, older; Elias Toufexis, young) was a local police officer in Blade's neighborhood when he was young. When Blade would run away, he would round up the young daywalker and return him to his father. Flannigan also hooked Blade's father up with Abraham Whistler, who tested the boy. Flannigan helped cover up what happened in Mr. Taka's store when Blade murdered some robbers. Flannigan was himself killed years later by Steppin' Razor, who was hunting down people from Blade's youth and killing them. The officer was killed in the same manner as one of the robbers. * Shen (Nelson Lee) is Blade's wisecracking weaponsmith. He makes the weapons that Blade uses in his hunt for vampires. Shen is also an expert in electronics and uses his abilities to hack computer networks for information on vampires and their business. Not much of Shen's background is revealed other than his sister was killed by vampires, and that Blade is helping him track those vampires down so that Shen can kill them. Shen also makes Blade's serum for him, and can speak and read the vampire language. * Mr. Taka (Hiro Kanagawa) was a local grocery store owner in Blade's neighborhood when he was young. Blade would sneak out of his locked bedroom to play chess with Mr. Taka in the park. When young Blade ran away from home for good, he first went to Mr. Taka's store but interrupted a robbery. Mr. Taka was wounded by the robbers, and Blade's father shot. Enraged, Blade attacked and killed the robbers before running away for good. Mr. Taka was killed by Steppin' Razor after Officer Flannigan. * Tucker Moffet (Tom Butler) is an architect and vampire familiar. He was hired by Marcus Van Sciver to remodel the site of the pureblood conclave to make it ready for dispersal of the Aurora Virus. Tucker at one point came to Marcus with a list of demands, Marcus killed Tucker's assistant and threatened him. When Tucker finally got the job finished, Marcus rewarded him with a hooker. Blade tracked Tucker down and plucked one of his eyeballs out to use to access the conclave site. * Uncle Pat (Don Thompson) was Krista Starr's Uncle. When Krista returned from the army and was turned by Marcus Van Sciver, Uncle Pat took it upon himself to track her down and tell her that her mom was dying. Uncle Pat also caused a scene with Marcus, as he believed Marcus was giving Krista drugs to keep her hooked. Uncle Pat was killed by Krista's mom after she was turned into a vampire by Krista. Blade beheaded Uncle Pat to keep him from becoming a vampire also. * Vanessa (Sonja Bennett) was a young woman who was approached by Dr. Vonner to serve as a surrogate mother. She thought she was carrying a baby for someone who couldn't have children, in actuality she was incubating the Aurora Virus in her womb. Blade kidnapped Vanessa and took her to a doctor in Paris who determined she was not pregnant and removed the virus, rendering her infertile. Vanessa was smuggled underground and presumably disappeared. Vanessa was also the first name of Blade's human mother. * Doctor Vonner (Andrew McIlroy) was the doctor hired by Marcus Van Sciver to help engineer the Aurora Virus. Dr. Vonner was an obstetrician that took selected young women and implanted their wombs with a virus incubator instead of a baby. Dr. Vonner also ran an early test lab for Marcus where Armayan vampires were tortured and experimented on. Dr. Vonner committed suicide with a gun to avoid being captured by Blade. * Zach Starr (David Kopp) was Krista Starr's brother. He was a familiar to Marcus Van Sciver and also worked as a double agent for Blade. Marcus became aware of Zach's betrayal and tricked him into a meeting at the docks. Zach thought he was finally going to be turned into a vampire, instead Marcus shot him in the head and dumped his body. Zach has appeared since then in visions to his sister where he encourages her to continue his work with Blade. * Viola Watkins (BJ Harrison, older; Robinne Fanfair, young) was a nurse who was dating Blade's father when Blade was young. She helped his father obtain blood to feed Blade's thirst. She also used to tap Blade's father for blood. She was hunted down years later by Steppin' Razor, who was killing everyone from Blade's past in order to flush Blade out of hiding. Blade and Shen barely saved her from being drowned. She revealed to Blade that his father wasn't dead, but actually was looking for him. Recurring vampires * Detective Brian Boone (Bill Mondy) was a familiar to Marcus van Sciver. He used his influence as a police officer to help the vampires cover up their crimes, and also secure fresh humans for feeding. Boone was double crossed by Marcus, who fed him to Krista Starr. Boone woke up in a testing facility for the Aurora Project and escaped, going on a cross country killing spree that ended when a group from Chthon cornered him at a meeting with the House of Armaya. Chase thought she killed Boone through a door, in fact he was hiding behind another vampire who was killed. Boone escaped and has not been seen since. * Alex (Kavan Smith) was a pureblood from the House of Erebus. Alex had once, 63 years earlier, been stood up by Chase. Alex and Chase spent a night together in Las Vegas, which was a lure to draw Alex to Detroit. He followed her to Detroit and attempted to buy Chase from Marcus for $4 million. It turned out to be a doublecross, and they used Alex as the pureblood test for the Aurora Project. He was killed by the successful virus test. * Fritz (David Palffy) was an associate of Marcus van Sciver's who did Marcus' muscle work. A physically imposing and strong vampire, he begged Marcus to be the test subject for Aurora, and was injected with the vaccine. Fritz gained immunity to garlic, silver, and sunlight as a result of the vaccine. Desperate to test his new power, he engaged Blade in a fight that ended in a draw. Fritz was then ordered to Prague to display his new talents for the Chthon board of directors. On his way, Fritz heard Blade attacking a Chthon assault team and defied Marcus by going there to fight Blade. This time, Blade took the upper hand and was about to capture Fritz when Krista Starr stepped in and beheaded Fritz. * Glynnis (Jody Thompson) was Charlotte's assistant and led the investigation into Marcus Van Sciver and the Aurora Project. Glynnis discovered that Marcus was misappropriating money and reported this to Charlotte. She also tracked down Krista Starr and discovered that Krista was working for Blade. Glynnis interrupted Krista as Krista turned her own mother, in the fight that erupted Glynnis was ashed by Krista who used a silver backed mirror to pierce her heart. * Sands (Ryan Robbins) was a vampire from the House of Erebus who was captured by Marcus Van Sciver and used in the Aurora experiments. He ended up disfigured by the experiments, and for unexplained reasons never regenerated. Sands led Blade to the experiment site, and Blade let him go in return. Eventually Sands found his way to Damek, and let him know what Marcus was doing to the Armayan vampires. He was last shown getting back into Damek's limo. * Steppin' Razor (Bokeem Woodbine) was the leader of the Bad Bloods street gang. A hardcore killer, SR took in young Blade after he ran away from his father. SR is the one who gave Blade the tattoos on his body. SR used Father Carlyle to track down Blade and take revenge for Blade biting and turning him into a vampire. SR was tattooing gang members one night when the thirst took hold of Blade, he bit several members of the gang and turned them. They were not accepted by any of the houses since they were turned by the Daywalker. SR made a deal with Marcus Van Sciver to turn Blade over to Marcus in exchange for acceptance into the House of Cththon. When the plan fell through, SR escaped and reappeared later, when he tracked down people from Blade's past and began killing them to draw Blade out. He found Blade's father and drew Blade to his childhood home for a final confrontation, which ended when Blade's human father ashed SR with Blade's sword. * Thorne (John DeSantis) was the Lurch-like servant of the pureblood Charlotte. Thorne carried Charlotte around and attended to her every need. He also captured Chase and brought her to Charlotte, who mentioned that Thorne only liked human women and had \\"quite an impressive collection\\". After Charlotte's plane was downed, Thorne and Charlotte ended up in a local high school, where they encountered Blade. The only line Thorne spoke in the series was \\"I want to hear you scream\\" as he beat on Blade. Blade ashed Thorne with two silver spikes to the head. * The White Prince (Scott Heindl) was a rogue vampire, unaffiliated with any house. He was a serial killer who operated every 19 years. He also permanently scarred his face with silver. He appeared to have a familiar working out of a local night club. They kidnapped a few girls to torture and kill when Shen and Blade got wind of his actions. They tracked the White Prince to the club, where he fought Blade before Blade ripped his entire jaw off and threw him outside into the sunlight. What was odd about the White Prince was that, rather than considering himself a vampire, he believed himself to be an angel, even going as far as to claim that Blade was sent by the devil to test his (the White Prince's) faith. Ratings and cancellation The series premiere had 2.5 million viewers and was the most-watched original series premiere in Spike TV history. It was also the #1 show on evening cable TV for men 18‚Äì34 and 18‚Äì49. However, this occurred in a year where most cable premieres were outstanding, and the series failed to hold its numbers. On September 28, 2006, Jill Wagner announced that there would be no second season of the show. The next day, Spike announced in a press release that the show would not be picked up. As a response to a letter in Wizard Magazine, series writer/producer Geoff Johns stated that: \\"The network didn't want to cancel it, I just think Spike TV is still a young network, and the price it was costing to make...they just weren't able to do it.\\" iTunes premiere *Blade: The Series was the second TV show to premiere on iTunes before ever having aired on mainstream television. The short-lived Law & Order spin-off Conviction was the first. Releases The pilot episode of the series was released on DVD as Blade: House of Chthon. The complete series was released in 2006 on a 4-disc DVD set by New Line Home Entertainment / Warner Bros., featuring the episodes revamped and alternated, with uncensored scenes considered \\"Too Graphic for TV\\". The series is available to stream on The CW's free digital-only network, CW Seed, as well as on Tubi.tv.

This national monument, in area, protects the Paria Plateau, Vermilion Cliffs, Coyote Buttes, and Paria Canyon. Elevations in the monument range from 3,100 feet to 6,500 feet above sea level (944 to 1,981 meters). Creation and designation Established on November 9, 2000 by a presidential proclamation by President Bill Clinton, Vermilion Cliffs National Monument was carved from existing lands already under the management of the U.S. Government in extreme northern Coconino County, Arizona, immediately south of the border with the state of Utah. The monument is administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Vermilion Cliffs themselves run along the southern and eastern edges of the monument. Much of the monument's land consists of the Paria Plateau, a flat area extending northward from the tops of the cliffs. Vermilion Cliffs Sunrise through a cleft in the Vermilion Cliffs The Vermilion Cliffs are steep eroded escarpments consisting primarily of sandstone, siltstone, limestone, and shale which rise as much as above their bases. These sedimentary rocks have been deeply eroded for millions of years, exposing hundreds of layers of richly colored rock strata. Mesas, buttes, and large tablelands are interspersed with steep canyons, where some small streams provide enough moisture to support a sampling of wildlife. Flora and fauna More than twenty species of raptors, including bald eagles and golden eagles, peregrine falcons, and several hawk species, have been observed. The endangered California condor has been re-introduced into this region recently due to its remote location and lack of human habitation. Desert bighorn sheep, pronghorns, and mountain lions make up most of the large mammals found here, with about 30 more species of smaller mammals. Several examples of rare fish species, such as the flannelmouth sucker and the speckled dace live in the streams of the monument. The Welsh's milkweed, a threatened plant species that grows on sand dunes and helps stabilize them, is known to exist only in the monument and one other area in neighboring Utah. Human settlements White Pocket area formation Human settlement in the region dates back 12,000 years, and hundreds of Native American pueblos are spread across the monument. The remains of the natives' villages, with houses, granaries, burial areas, and associated ruins, can be found here. The monument also contains one of the largest number of rock art sites in any nationally protected area. Many of these petroglyphs are believed to be among the oldest in the United States. The first explorers into the region were Spanish missionaries and explorers from the 1776 Dom√≠nguez‚ÄìEscalante expedition. Later, Mormon explorers searched the region during the 1860s, some of them settling on land that is now within the monument. They built one of the first ferry crossings on the Colorado River in 1871. That same year, John Wesley Powell ventured through this region during his scientific explorations of the Colorado River plateau. Below the Vermilion cliffs runs the historic \\"Honeymoon Trail\\", a wagon route for Mormons who journeyed to have their marriages sealed in the temple at St. George, Utah, and then to return. The route, through remote country, was otherwise seldom used. Historical markers denote this history. Today, the region surrounding the monument is relatively unspoiled with virtually no permanent inhabitants remaining and limited road access.

The solution depends on the initial conditions at t=0: u(x,0) and u_t(x,0).

Details The characteristics of the PDE are x\\\\pm ct=\\\\mathrm{const}\\\\,, so we can use the change of variables \\\\mu=x+ct, \\\\eta=x-ct\\\\, to transform the PDE to u_{\\\\mu\\\\eta}=0\\\\,. The general solution of this PDE is u(\\\\mu,\\\\eta) = F(\\\\mu) + G(\\\\eta)\\\\, where F\\\\, and G\\\\, are C^1\\\\, functions. Back in x,t\\\\, coordinates, :u(x,t)=F(x+ct)+G(x-ct)\\\\, :u\\\\, is C^2\\\\, if F\\\\, and G\\\\, are C^2\\\\,. This solution u\\\\, can be interpreted as two waves with constant velocity c\\\\, moving in opposite directions along the x-axis. Now consider this solution with the Cauchy data u(x,0)=g(x), u_t(x,0)=h(x)\\\\,. Using u(x,0)=g(x)\\\\, we get F(x)+G(x)=g(x)\\\\,. Using u_t(x,0)=h(x)\\\\, we get cF'(x)-cG'(x)=h(x)\\\\,. We can integrate the last equation to get :cF(x)-cG(x)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x h(\\\\xi) \\\\, d\\\\xi + c_1.\\\\, Now we can solve this system of equations to get :F(x) = \\\\frac{-1}{2c}\\\\left(-cg(x)-\\\\left(\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x h(\\\\xi) \\\\, d\\\\xi +c_1 \\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\, :G(x) = \\\\frac{-1}{2c}\\\\left(-cg(x)+\\\\left(\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x h(\\\\xi) d\\\\xi +c_1 \\\\right)\\\\right).\\\\, Now, using :u(x,t) = F(x+ct)+G(x-ct)\\\\, d'Alembert's formula becomes: :u(x,t) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[g(x-ct) + g(x+ct)\\\\right] + \\\\frac{1}{2c} \\\\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} h(\\\\xi) \\\\, d\\\\xi.  Generalization for inhomogeneous canonical hyperbolic differential equations  The general form of an inhomogeneous canonical hyperbolic type differential equation takes the form of: u_{tt}-u_{xx}=f(x,t),\\\\, u(x,0)=g(x),\\\\, u_t(x,0)=h(x), for -\\\\infty < x<\\\\infty,\\\\,\\\\, t>0, f\\\\in C^2(\\\\R^2,\\\\R) . All second order differential equations with constant coefficients can be transformed into their respective canonic forms. This equation is one of these three cases: Elliptic partial differential equation, Parabolic partial differential equation and Hyperbolic partial differential equation. The only difference between a homogeneous and an inhomogeneous (partial) differential equation is that in the homogeneous form we only allow 0 to stand on the right side ( f(x,t) = 0 ), while the inhomogeneous one is much more general, as in f(x,t) could be any function as long as it's continuous and can be continuously differentiated twice. The solution of the above equation is given by the formula: u(x,t) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Bigl( g(x+t)+g(x-t)\\\\biggr)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\biggl(\\\\int\\\\limits_{x-t}^{x+t} h(s)ds\\\\biggr) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\biggl(\\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{t}\\\\int\\\\limits_{x-t+\\\\tau}^{x+t-\\\\tau} f(s,\\\\tau)ds d\\\\tau \\\\Bigr) . If g(x) = 0 , the first part disappears, if h(x) = 0 , the second part disappears, and if f(x) = 0 , the third part disappears from the solution, since integrating the 0-function between any two bounds always results in 0. This means, that the homogeneous equation ( f(x,t) = 0 ) gives back our original formula for the case of c=1 .

Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203 (1948), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case related to the power of a state to use its tax- supported public school system to aid religious instruction. The case was a test of the separation of church and state with respect to education. The case tested the principle of \\"released time\\", where public schools set aside class time for religious instruction. The Court struck down a Champaign, Illinois program as unconstitutional because of the public school system's involvement in the administration, organization and support of religious instruction classes. The Court noted that some 2,000 communities nationwide offered similar released time programs affecting 1.5 million students.. Background The case was brought by Vashti McCollum, the mother of a student enrolled in the Champaign public school district. In 1940, interested members of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faiths formed an association named the Champaign Council on Religious Education. This association obtained permission from the Champaign Board of Education to offer voluntary religious education classes for public school students from grades four to nine. These weekly 30- and 45-minute classes were led by clergy and lay members of the association in public school classrooms during school hours. McCollum, an atheist, objected to the religious classes, stating that her son James was ostracized for not attending them. After complaints to school officials to stop offering these classes went unheeded, McCollum sued the school board in July 1945, stating that the religious instruction in the public schools violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment‚Äîthe principle of separation of church and state in the United States. McCollum also complained that the school district's religious education classes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The principal elements of the McCollum complaint were that: * In actual practice certain Protestant groups exercised an advantage over other Protestant denominations. * The school district's calling the classes \\"voluntary\\" was in name only because school officials coerced or forced students' participation. * The power exercised by the Champaign Council on Religious Education in its selection of instructors, and the school superintendent's oversight of these instructors served to determine which religious faiths participated in the instructional program, and constituted a prior censorship of religion. In her suit, McCollum asked that the Board of Education be ordered to \\"adopt and enforce rules and regulations prohibiting all instruction in and teaching of all religious education in all public schools in Champaign District Number 71, and in all public school houses and buildings in said district when occupied by public schools\\". The Circuit Court of Champaign County ruled in favor of the school district in January 1946, and upon appeal the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling. Decision of the Court McCollum sought review from the U. S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case, taking oral arguments in December 1947. A number of religious groups including the American Unitarian Association, the Synagogue Council of America, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists and the Baptist Joint Committee of Religious Liberty filed briefs in support of McCollum's position. On March 8, 1948, the Court ruled 8-1 in favor of McCollum, ruling that the classes were unconstitutional. In the majority opinion, written by Justice Hugo Black, the Court held that Dissent The lone dissenting justice, Stanley Forman Reed, objected to the breadth of the majority's interpretation of the Establishment Clause and stated that an incidental support of religion should have been permissible with a more narrow reading of the First Amendment. Subsequent developments The Supreme Court's ruling remanded the case to the Illinois high court for relief consistent with the federal ruling. The high court revisited the issue of religious instruction in Zorach v. Clauson in 1952. The 6 to 3 ruling in the later case held that a New York program allowing religious education during the school day was permissible, because it did not use public school facilities or public funds.

As well, the political dominance of the Royal House of Savoy leading up to its eventual installation as the ruling dynasty of united Italy was important. Musically, the Teatro Regio in Torino was one of the fine, old opera houses in Europe, stemming from the 1730s. Also from that period is the Teatro Carignano, which in the late 19th century was the venue for some of the early works of Giacomo Puccini. Torino was actually the first capital of Italy, but with the final unification of the nation in 1861, that function, has been assumed by Rome. Various facets of cultural life, thus, went through a certain period of \\"downsizing\\" in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, however, Arturo Toscanini became the conductor of the municipal symphony and the musical life of the city was rejuvenated. A radio symphony was formed in the 1930s and now, Torino is the seat of the National Symphony Orchestra. Music theaters and auditoriums in Torino include the Teatro Regio (rebuilt in 1973), the Lingotto or the Gianni Agnelli auditorium (opened in 1994 on the premises of an ex-Fiat factory), the new RAI auditorium (home of the national symphony), the Circolo degli Artisti, (where Toscanini broke in at age 22 as a cellist), and the premises of the Giuseppe Verdi conservatory.

British and French forces were implementing a strategy of destroying the supply lines for the main Russian army which ran across the Sea of Azov. Taganrog was one of the major logistical hubs of the Russian army and was attacked and its military depot destroyed on 3 June 1855 (NS) as part of a series of attacks on all major Russian supply bases in the area, except Rostov-on-Don, which could not be reached due to the large shoals not admitting any available warship.D.K. Brown, \\"Before the Ironclad\\", section titled \\"Gun boat operations and the Black Sea 1855\\"A. Lambert, \\"The Crimean War: British Grand Strategy against Russia, 1853‚Äì56\\" pgs 247-250 Prelude In the spring of 1855, as the Crimean War dragged on into its third year, the British and the French decided to begin operations in the Sea of Azov. They reasoned that this would allow them to cut off the Crimea even further from Russia and prevent further supplies from reaching Russian forces there by sea via the seaports in the Taman. This strategy required them to occupy the Strait of Kerch, which was to be undertaken by a joint force of British and French soldiers and warships. Taganrog, at the far eastward end of the Sea of Azov, was selected as a potential target for attack. Taganrog is located on a strip of land jutting out slightly into the Sea of Azov and, to the British and the French, formed an excellent stepping stone to Rostov-on-Don. Taking Rostov-on-Don would allow the allies to threaten the rear of the Russian forces. Plans were drawn up, and the British and French prepared 16,000 ground troops and about forty small warships for the \\"Azov Campaign\\". Meanwhile, Taganrog's governor-general, Nikolay Adlerberg, had been replaced by Yegor Tolstoy, an ageing but versatile general, who had served in the Russian Army in fighting against the Turks. In April 1854, Tolstoy assumed command at Taganrog, along with Ivan Krasnov (who commanded the Don Cossacks in the region) and prepared his forces. He had three sotnias of Don Cossacks (No.s 180 –ú–æ—Ä—à–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –¥—Ä—É–∂–∏–Ω–∞, 184 –°–ø–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞—è and 188 –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å–æ–≥–ª–µ–±—Å–∫–∞—è) and a local garrison of some 630 soldiers at his command at the time of the siege. A unit of \\"home guards\\", totalling 250 men, were recruited from the local population. Taganrog lacked any modern fortifications and Tolstoy had no artillery to speak of. Operations against Taganrog Order of battle The allied force that attacked Taganrog on 3 June 1855 consisted of: * HMS Recruit (Lt George Fiott Day, with Capt E.M. Lyons and staff aboard) - paddle gunboat, 6 guns * HMS Danube (Lt R.P. Cator) - nominally unarmed paddle tug but armed as per the launches, towed Lady Nancy into position * Mouette (Captaine du Corvette Lallemand) - paddle aviso, 2 guns * 1st launch from HMS Royal Albert (Lt J.D. Curtis) - each launch carried a single boat howitzer (24 pdr) and a rocket launcher * 2nd launch from HMS Royal Albert (Lt T.M.S. Pasley) * 1st launch from HMS Hannibal (Mr. A.F. Hurt, acting mate) * 2nd launch from HMS Hannibal (Lt J.H. Crang) * 1st launch from HMS Algiers (Mr. J.C. Wilson, mate) * 2nd launch from HMS Algiers (Lt F.G.C. Paget) * 1st launch from HMS Agamemnon (Lt T.L. Gaussen) * 2nd launch from HMS Agamemnon (Lt T.J. Young) * 1st launch from HMS St. Jean d'Acre (Lt E.W. Turnour) * 2nd launch from HMS St. Jean d'Acre (Lt T.J. Young) * 1st launch from HMS Princess Royal (Lt John Murray) * 2nd launch from HMS Princess Royal (Lt W.H.Jones) * four similar French launches * Lady Nancy - raft with a short 32 pounder on deck in the protected cupola. * a four-oared gig that landed Lt Cecil Buckley and Boatswain Henry Cooper HMS Sulina (unarmed paddle tug, Mr. C.H. Williams, acting mate) and HMS Medina (unarmed steam packet, Lt Comd H.B. Beresford) along with Danube towed the launches to outside Taganrog, but did not approach the city. Similarly the French paddle aviso Dauphin,2 towed their launches, but did not approach the city. The light forces were split into two groups; one under Commander Coles was to bombard the store, and a second group under Lt J.F.C. Mackenzie, RMA landed and covered Buckley and Cooper. Destruction of the Military Depot Starting on 24 May (12 May O.S.), 1855, the British and the French began operations in the Sea of Azov. They landed troops on either side of the Kerch Strait, quickly capturing the cities of Kerch and Enikale. Following those actions, naval forces destroyed the Russian coastal battery at Kamishevaya Bay and entered the Sea of Azov. On the evening of 1 June 1855 the Anglo-French squadron, which consisted of 5 paddle steamers and 16 armed launches (on loan from the main allied fleet at Sevastapol) commanded by Captain Edmund Lyons (son of Rear Admiral Edmund Lyons) and Captain B√©ral de Sedaiges, anchored 8.5 miles of Taganrog in 18 feet of water. On the 2nd HMS Recruit was sent forward to reconnoiter Taganrog and sound the shoals off the town. On the 3rd the Recruit returned and under a flag of truce requested the surrender of the military depot for destruction, the withdrawal of military forces five miles away from the city and the evacuation of the civilian residents. Accompanying the Recruit were the British paddle steamer Danube, the French paddle aviso Mouette, and many small launches from larger ships operating elsewhere. These included 12 British armed steam launches (each with a 24 pounder boat howitzer and/or a rocket launcher), 4 similarly armed French launches, and the raft Lady Nancy. This latter raft occupies an interesting place in the history of naval architecture as Commander Cowper P. Coles of HMS Stromboli had erected an protected cupola on her, and placed a 32 pounder within. From this sprang ultimately the modern turret used aboard warships. The ultimatum was answered by Tolstoy's official for important missions, Baron Yevgeny Pfeilizer-Frank (nephew to former governor Otto Pfeilizer-Frank) and poet Nikolay Sherbina, who later described the event in Moskovskiye Vedomosti on 21 June 1855. The allies demanded the surrender of all government property, the withdrawal of troops and the evacuation of civilians. After an hour of consideration Baron Pfeilizer-Frank returned to the envoys with Tolstoy's reply, rejecting the demands.\\"Destruction of Russian Stores at Taganrog\\" in The Illustrated London News, 14 July 1855 The Recruit then hauled down her flag of truce and opened fire on the town. The Danube and Mouette, towing the Lady Nancy moved up in the company of the armed launches and joined in the bombardment. A four-oared gig then landed Lt Cecil Buckley and Boatswain Henry Cooper, who proceeded to set fire to the military depots buildings before returning, in the same manner they had at Genitchi on 29 May. The raft Lady Nancy and some of the launches gave close support to the raiding party. Both earned the Victoria Cross for their actions and due to seniority and spelling Buckley was awarded the first VC ever gazetted. All the stores of grain, timber, tar, all the boats in the harbour (including the Russian gunboat Akkerman and various other warships under construction) and any boats under construction, together with the Customs House and the main government buildings were set ablaze. Tolstoy in his official report claimed the allies had landed a major force near the Old Stone Steps (–ö–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ª–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–∞) and Greek Church in downtown Taganrog followed the bombardment which was allegedly repulsed by the Cossacks and the volunteer corps. The allies suffered a single casualty in the operation, Gunner C. Evans of the Royal Marine Artillery was struck in the face by a spent musket ball whilst manning the howitzer of the launch from HMS Princess Royal. Russian losses were significant, including the gunboat Akkerman destroyed in the harbour, and four months food supply for the main Russian army at Sevastapol.This section is extracted largely from Captain Lyons' report on the action, available online at The Gazette The allied squadron, having effected their objective, moved off and attacked Mariupol on 5 June and Gheisk on the 6th with similar destructive effects. By mid-June every single coastal town on the Sea of Azov had been attacked and their supplies destroyed to deny them to the main Russian army at Sevastapol. Continuing Operations Bombardment of Taganrog on 3 June 1855 After the destruction of their supply bases on the Azov, the Russians deployed another fourteen sotnias (squadrons) of Don Cossacks to the region around the Sea of Azov to protect the various coastal cities. This brought the total number of Cossack sotnias in the area to 16. They attempted to fortify Taganrog and other points. At Taganrog this work consisted of building an earthwork artillery battery. On 19 July (NS), Commander Sherard Osborn conducted a reconnoiter of Taganrog aboard HMS Jasper and observed the battery being built. The Jasper put two shells into the battery but did not receive a response, and so moved off.Report of Commander Sherard Osborn dated 21 June 1855, reproduced in \\"British Battles of the Crimean War 1854-6\\", Pen and Sword 2014 The Jasper would shortly thereafter become the only allied warship lost in the Sea of Azov campaign when she grounded on Krivaya Spit or \\"Crooked Spit\\" near the present-day town of Sedjove in Ukraine, 15 miles west of Taganrog on 23 July. Most sources report that local fishermen moved various buoys that marked water depth, which forced the British warship ashore.The New York Times, 30 August 1855The Moreton Bay Courier (Brisbane, Qld. : 1846 - 1861), Saturday 15 December 1855, page 2 Author Bryan Perret claims instead that she had just destroyed a Russian fortification and had taken the captured guns aboard as prizes. Hence she was running much deeper than normal and grounded. After a day of being unable to free her, and under fire from a force of Cossacks, Jasper's crew was taken off aboard HMS Swallow and the ship scuttled.B. Perrett \\"Gunboat!: Small Ships At War\\", Chapter 1 Don Cossacks subsequently boarded the derelict and captured her two 24 pounder howitzers and 60 shells from her magazine, along with some trophies, like the ship's ensign. The guns were sent to the Cathedral in Taganrog (used as a military base by the Russian Army) and sent onwards to Cherkassk where they were mounted in the coastal defences.Filevski The Cossacks eventually blew up the stranded hull. A Royal Navy report said that five days later (29 July) Lieutenant George Lydiard Sulivan (CO of HMS Fancy) dived the wrecked Jasper, recovered her 68 pounder and placed a demolition charge to complete her destruction, as it was found the destruction of her magazine and the shells of HMS Swallow had left her hull in a salvageable state.See Sulivan's entry in the \\"Royal Navy List\\" - no online source found at this time On 5 August 1855 Osborn arrived off Taganrog to destroy the new battery with HMS Vesuvius, HMS Grinder and HMS Wrangler. Driving off the garrison with gunfire the squadron covered a landing party which took control of the battery, took some as prizes, spiked the remaining guns and threw them in the sea, and then blew up the battery before retiring.Identities of ships found in P. Dukkers, \\"The Crimean War at Sea\\", Pen and Sword 2011, specifically Chapter 8 \\"Scouring the Sea of Azoff, Summer 1855\\" A few days later the garrison of Taganrog was reinforced further with the Reserve Brigade of the 15th Infantry Division, some 4,000 infantrymen under Major-General Leyna (–õ–µ–π–Ω–∞), in addition to the large number of Cossacks absorbed by the defence. Patrols continued in the area, and in early September Lt Day's group of HMS Recruit, HMS Curlew and HMS Fancy rode out a storm in Taganrog Roads whilst preparing to strike the Russian force (2 gunboats and 16 barges used as floating batteries) at the mouth of the River Don, but when they approached the Don on 13 September they found the storm had driven off all the Russian defenders.Dukker, ibid A small raiding party of three from Wrangler, trying to destroy a number of fishing boats at a small lake, was cut off and captured near Mariupol by a group of Cossacks who ambushed them. Patrols continued throughout October and the last patrol of the year reconnoitered Taganrog on 20 November, finding not a single vessel remaining in the harbour. On 24 November Osborn took his remaining ships out of the Sea of Azov as the sea ice started to form, wintering in a warmer climate. Conclusion Russian forces at Taganrog stood down on 21 June 1856, and life in the city began to return to normal. The Crimean War cost the city of Taganrog more than one million rubles. Considerable damage was done to local structures. Twenty mansions were completely destroyed, and 74 were damaged to some degree. One hundred and eighty-nine other buildings, primarily granaries and storehouses, were destroyed and 44 damaged. Tsar Alexander II exempted the citizens of Taganrog of having to pay taxes for the year of 1857. 163 Taganrog soldiers were awarded with medals and military orders because of their service during the siege.

Paris: Dictionnaires Le Robert, 1993. .) was a headdress in the shape of a cone, steeple, or truncated cone worn in the late Middle Ages by European women of the nobility.\\"Cornet\\" from Herbert Norris, Medieval costume and fashion 1999 (orig 1927 :445‚Äì48. They were most common in Burgundy and France, but also elsewhere, especially at the English courts,Norris shows examples from the reigns of Henry VI and Edward IV and in Northern Europe, Hungary and Poland. They are little seen in Italy. It is unclear what styles the word hennin described at the time, though it is recorded as being used in French in 1428, probably before the conical style appeared. The word does not appear in English until the 19th century.OED, \\"Hennin\\" The term is therefore used by some writers on costume for other female head-dresses of the period.Piponnier and Mane are among the writers who use it, just for conical head-dresses, p. 80  Conical hennins  A French hennin, , with several white veils, one reaching down to the face. (The white crescent at the tip belongs to the figure behind.) These appear from about 1430 onwards,Piponnier & Mane, 80 especially after the mid-century, initially only among aristocratic women, though later spreading more widely, especially in the truncated form. Typically, the hennin was 30 to 45 cm high, but might be considerably higher, as much as 80 cm. The tops of some of these conical hats were pointed while others were truncated, ending in a flat top. It was generally accompanied by a veil (cointoise) that usually emerged from the top of the cone and was allowed to fall onto the woman's shoulders or even to the ground, or was pulled forward over the hennin, often reaching over the woman's face. The hennin was worn tilted backward at an angle. It was made of light material, often card or a wire mesh over which a light fabric was fixed, although little is known of the details of their construction. There was often a cloth lappet (cornet) in front of the hennin covering part of the brow, and sometimes falling onto the shoulders to either side. There is very often a \\"frontlet\\" or short loop seen on the forehead (example) to adjust the hennin forward, and perhaps even to hold it on in wind.M. Vibbert, \\"Headdresses of the 14th and 15th Centuries,\\" The Compleat Anachronist, No. 133, SCA monograph series (August 2006) It was fashionable to pluck or shave the forehead to raise the hairlines.\\"A New Look for Women.\\" Arts and Humanities Through the Eras. Gale. 2005. Retrieved August 13, 2012 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3427400451.html The hair was tied tightly on the scalp and usually hidden inside the cone (possibly one end of the veil was tied to the hair and wrapped round, with the free end being pulled through the hole at the tip of the cone). However, some images show long hair worn loose behind the hennin. Nowadays, the hennin forms part of the depiction of the stereotypical fairy-tale princess. There are some manuscript illuminations that show princesses or queens wearing small crowns either round the brim or at the top of the hennin; it is likely that the very small crown of Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy (now in the treasury of Aachen Cathedral) was worn like this for her famously lavish wedding celebrations in 1468.  Definition  Various writers on costume history use hennin to cover a variety of different styles. Almost all agree that the steeple-cone style was a hennin, and the truncated (\\"flowerpot\\") versions. Many also include the heart- shaped open-centred escoffion. Some also use the term to cover beehive-shaped fabric head-coverings of the mid-century (example). Others also use it for the head-dresses divided to right and left of the early part of the century, such as those in which Christine de Pisan is usually depicted (example). In some of these only white cloth is visible, but in later examples worn by aristocrats rich fabric can be seen through translucent veils. Some use it for the horned hairstyle with a wimple on top. A recreated 19th-century hennin-like Lebanese tantour The Chronique of Enguerrand de Monstrelet records that in 1428, in what seems to be the first record of the term \\"hennin\\", the radical Carmelite friar Thomas Conecte railed against extravagant headdresses of... > ...the noble ladies, and all others, who dressed their heads in so > ridiculous a manner, and who spent such large sums on such luxuries of > fashion.Online text of the Chronique in English - 19th century translation. > Quoted in Norris 1999:445. French text here Thomas urged street boys to chase after such ladies and pluck off their headdresses, crying \\"Au hennin!\\", even granting indulgences to those who did so, although as so often in medieval documentary records, no clue as to the form of the \\"hennins\\" is given.A Cyclopedia Of Costume Vol. II A General History Of Costume In Europe of 1819 By James Robinson Planche Based on the evidence from visual records, they were probably not conical head-dresses, which are first seen slightly later.

The relationship between the two clusters is not doubted but is not close. The name Tuu comes from a word for \\"person\\" common to both branches of the family.  Classification  The Tuu languages are not demonstrably related to any other language family, however they do share a great many similarities to the languages of the Kx ºa family. This is generally thought to be due to thousands of years of contact and mutual influence (that is, a sprachbund), but some scholars believe that the two families may eventually prove to be related. The Tuu languages were once thought to form a branch of the now-obsolete Khoisan language family and were called Southern Khoisan in that scenario.

The Taa branch of Botswana is more robust, though it also has one surviving language, «ÉX√≥√µ, with 2,500 speakers. Because many of the Tuu languages became extinct with little record, there is considerable confusion as to which of their many names represented separate languages or even dialects. See List of Khoisan languages for some possibilities. The Tuu languages, along with neighbouring «Ç ºAmkoe, are known for being the only languages in the world to have bilabial clicks as distinctive speech sounds (apart from the extinct ritual jargon Damin of northern Australia, which was never anyone's mother tongue). Taa, «Ç ºAmkoe and neighbouring G«Äui (of the Khoe family) form a sprachbund (language area) with some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world.

History  Territory of modern Il≈´kste was inhabited by ancient baltic tribe- Selonians. As a settlement Il≈´kste started to grow in the beginning of 16th century when it was part of Livonian Confederation and was administered by Komtur of Daugavpils. Il≈´kste was first mentioned in written sources in 1559 as a small village, part of the estate lands of Count Kasper Sieberg. After secularization of Livonian Order Il≈´kste became part of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. In 1567 lutheran church was built in Il≈´kste. Many Russian Old-Believers found refuge in Il≈´kste during this period. During 17th century local landowner Bartholomew Zieberg offered refugee to Jesuits who were expelled from Swedish controlled Riga. As a result, wooden Catholic church was built in Il≈´kste in 1690. In the 18th century Jesuits constructed a large Catholic church with two towers which at that time was one of the biggest in Latvia. After the Duchy of Courland was incorporated in the Russian Empire in 1795, thanks to its strategic location at the crossroads of Lithuania, Belarus and Daugavpils, Il≈´kste became an important trade city and regional center, with 50 churches, 15 schools, and 150 taverns. In 1816 Uniat church was built in Il≈´kste. In 19th century many Jewish merchants settled in Il≈´kste and annual fairs were held. In 1840 highway from St. Petersburg to Warsaw was constructed nearby which stimulated further development. In 1865 new Lutheran church was built. In 1873 railway line Daugavpils-Tilsit was constructed through the town. In 1910 Russian teacher institute was opened in Il≈´kste. In World War I, Il≈´kste was situated on the fighting front line, and by the war's end the city was totally destroyed. There were no intact houses left in Il≈´kste and also all churches were damaged. Il≈´kste was granted town rights in 1917 however it never fully regained its pre-war level of prosperity. In 1927 a new school building was constructed in town and Latvian poet, playwright and at that moment Minister of Education Rainis participated in the opening ceremony. During the Soviet period, some industries shifted from Daugavpils to Il≈´kste.

Incumbent Republican Governor George W. Bush was re- elected in a landslide over 4-term Democratic Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, winning 68% of the vote to Mauro's 31%. Bush's 37% margin of victory was the largest won by any candidate since 1966 and is, to date, the largest ever won by a Republican candidate. Bush carried 239 counties, while Mauro carried just 15. Exit polls revealed that Bush won 27% of the African American vote, which was the highest percentage for any Republican statewide candidate, and 49% of the Latino vote. Bush was sworn in for a second term as Governor on January 19, 1999. As of 2020, this is the most recent gubernatorial election in which Travis County voted for the Republican candidate. Background George W. Bush, the son of former President of the United States George H. W. Bush, was elected governor in 1994, defeating incumbent Democratic Governor Ann Richards. Upon taking office in January 1995, Bush had a low approval rating of 38%. Over the course of his first term, this increased significantly, reaching 70% in February 1997. Going into the election, Bush had an approval rating of 76%. Primaries Republican Democratic Campaign Throughout the entire campaign, George W. Bush led in the polls by wide margins. After Garry Mauro declared his candidacy in November 1997, a Scripps Howard Texas Poll of 793 registered voters showed George W. Bush leading by 68%-16%, with 14% undecided. George Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said, \\"The philosophical differences between Gov. Bush and Garry Mauro are clear and stark. Gov. Bush is a conservative, as most Texans are, and Garry Mauro is a liberal.\\" In mid-June 1998, a Scripps Howard Texas Poll was conducted with George W. Bush versus Garry Mauro. The poll showed 70% likely voters support Bush, 17% favored Mauro, 11% were undecided, and 2% would vote for neither. Bush's approval rating was also virtually unchanged polling at 75%. In response to the poll, government professor at the University of Texas in Austin said, \\"Gov. Bush looks to be unbeatable, but there's enough time for anything to happen. There is a slim chance for Mauro but still a real chance for him to reach voters with ad dollars and issue choices. It's just too early to call the November election in June.\\" On June 22, 1998, Mauro called Bush out of touch saying, \\"Governor Bush is out of touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens and in bed with the giant HMO's.\\" This was because in 1995, Bush vetoed the Patient Protection Act, which would have forced state- regulated healthcare organizations to allow their customers to choose their own doctor. The Patient Protection Act would have also mandated that insurance companies to cover cancer treatment received at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Another Scripps Howard Texas Poll was conducted from August 12 to August 27, 1998. It indicated that 77% of likely voters support Bush, 20% favored Mauro, and 1% supported Libertarian candidate Lester Turlington Jr. About 10% were undecided and 2% didn't answer. Again, Bush's approval rating barely fell and was 74% of Texans remarked that he was doing a good to excellent job as governor. Allan Saxe, an assistant political science professor at the University of Texas said, \\"Now he's ahead [Bush] by an awfully huge margin. If Garry Mauro can close that to a 10 to 15 percent difference by election day, it will be a symbolic victory. But it will be hard to do - a 50-point difference is a big one.\\" Among Hispanics, Bush led Mauro 51%-31%, down from 67%-20% in June. George W. Bush and Garry Mauro met for the sole gubernatorial election debate in El Paso on October 16, 1998. Initially, Bush seemed rather nervous and defensive. Mauro attacked Bush for his position on teachers salaries and support for a nuclear waste dump in Sierra Blanca. However, Bush was well prepared and attacked Mauro's tax and spending proposals, describing them as \\"overambitious\\". The results of the debate would have little impact on the general election in November. Results Aftermath Following his defeat, Garry Mauro was succeeded by David Dewhurst as the Commissioner of the General Land Office in early 1999. Mauro would later serve as the Texas State Chairman for various Democratic presidential candidates, including for Al Gore in 2000, Dick Gephardt in 2004, and Hillary Clinton in 2008. However, Mauro himself never sought political office again. Eventually, he opened a private law practice in his hometown of Austin. George W. Bush was inaugurated for his second term as Governor of Texas on January 19, 1999. With his brother sworn-in as Governor of Florida earlier that month, George and Jeb Bush became the first two brothers to simultaneously serve as governors since Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller from 1967 to 1971. Five months later, in June 1999, Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 2000. At the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush was nominated for President of the United States and narrowly won the election against Al Gore. On December 21, 2000, less than two years into his second term, George W. Bush resigned as Governor of Texas and was succeeded by Rick Perry.

Its headquarters are located at Sri Aurbindo Marg in New Delhi. Dr. Hrushikesh Senapaty is director of the council since September 2015.  History  The Government of India's Ministry of Education resolved on 27 July 1961 to establish the National Council of Educational Research and Training, which formally began operation on 1 September 1961. The Council was formed by merging seven existing national government institutions, namely the Central Institute of Education, the Central Bureau of Textbook Research, the Central Bureau of Educational and Vocational Guidance, the Directorate of Extension Programmes for Secondary Education, the National Institute of Basic Education, the National Fundamental Education Centre, and the National Institute of Audio-Visual Education. It is separate from the National Council for Teacher Education. The NCERT was established with the agenda to design and support a common system of education which is national in character and also enables and encourages the diverse culture across the country. Based on the recommendations of the Education Commission(1964-66), the first national policy statement on education was issued in 1968. The policy endorsed the adoption of a uniform pattern of school education across the country consisting of 10 years of general education program followed by 2 years of diversified schooling. The NCERT is also behind the formation of the National Science Talent Search Scheme (NTSS) in the year 1963. The program was aimed at identifying, nurturing the talented students in India, and rewarding them with scholarships. The National Science Talent Search Scheme (NTSS) underwent a major change in the year 1976 with the introduction of the 10+2+3 pattern of education. The program was renamed to National Talent Search Scheme with the NTSE examination now being conducted for classes X, XI, and XII. Currently, the NTSE exam is conducted only for 10th class students in India.  The Curriculum for the Ten-year school  This framework came in 1975. It emphasized that a curriculum based on the principles laid out in the framework has to be developed on the basis of research. Thus for NCERT, the 1970s was a decade flushed with curriculum research and development activities to narrate the content and process of education to Indian realities.  National Curriculum for Elementary and Secondary Education  This revised curriculum framework came in 1988 following 1986 National Policy on Education.It encompassed 12 years of school education and suggested a reorientation of curricular and instructional materials to make them more child-centered. It advocated returning out examination reforms and the implementation of CCE at all stages of education.  National Curriculum Framework for School Education  This framework came in 2000. It stressed the need for a healthful, agreeable, and stress-free adolescence and reduction of the curricular contents. Thus a multicultural thematic approach was recommended, environmental education was pronounced upon and language and mathematics got desegregated in the first two years of education. National Curriculum Framework: The council came up with a new National Curriculum Framework in 2005, drafted by a National Steering Committee. This exercise was based on 5 guiding principles: # Connecting knowledge to life outside school # Shift from the rote method of learning # Enriching the curriculum for the overall development of children so that it goes beyond textbooks # Making examinations flexible and integrating them with classroom life and # Nurturing an identity informed by caring concerns.  Logo  The design of the NCERT logo is taken from an Ashokan period relic of the 3rd century BCE which was found in excavations near Maski in Raichur district, Karnataka. The motto has been taken from the Isha Upanishad and means 'life eternal through learning'. The intertwined hansas symbolize the integration of the three aspects of the work of NCERT: * Research and development * Training * Extension  Objectives  The council's objectives are: * To promote and conduct educational research, experimentation of innovative ideas and practice. * To develop National Curriculum Framework (NCF 2005), syllabi, and textbooks; teaching-learning materials and kits; training models and strategies; audio, video, and ICT materials. * Training of Pre- service and in-service teacher education and national and state-level functionaries. * To collaborate with State, national and international organizations. Textbooks Textbooks published by NCERT are prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) from classes I to XII, with exceptions for a few subjects. Around 19 school boards from 14 states have adopted or adapted the books. Online textbooks can be downloaded for free from the E-pathshala website. Those who wish to adopt the textbooks are required to send a request to NCERT, upon which soft copies of the books are received. The material is press-ready and may be printed by paying a 5% royalty, and by acknowledging NCERT. The textbooks are in color-print and are among the least valuable books in Indian bookstores. Textbooks created by private publishers are priced higher than those of NCERT. According to a government policy decision in 2017, the NCERT will have the exclusive task of publishing central textbooks from 2018, and the role of CBSE will be limited to conducting examinations.From 2018, only NCERT to publish school textbooks, The Times of India, 7 June 2017.  Regional Institutes of Education  The Regional Institute of Education (RIE, formerly known as Regional College of Education), is a constituent unit of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), New Delhi. The RIEs are set up in 1963 by the Government of India in different parts covering various regions. The Regional Institutes were started with the objective of qualitative improvement of school education through innovative pre-service and in-service teacher education programs and relevant research, development, and extension activities.  Actions  NCERT has a comprehensive extension program in which departments of the National Institute of Education, Regional Institute of Education, Central Institute of Vocational Education, and field coaches' offices in the states are engaged in activities. Several programs are organized in rural and backward areas to reach out to functionaries in these areas. The council acts as the Secretariat of the National Development Group for Educational Innovations. It has been offering training facilities to education workers of other countries through attachment programs and workshops. The council publishes textbooks for school subjects from classes I to XII. NCERT publishes books & provides sample question papers that are used in government and private schools across India that follow the CBSE curriculum. An online system named e-pathshala, a joint initiative of NCERT and Ministry of Human Resource Development, has been developed for broadcasting educational e-schooling resources including textbooks, audio, video, publications, and a variety of other print and non- print elements, ensuring their free access through mobile phones and tablets (as EPUB) and from the web through laptops and desktops. Controversies Ever since its establishment, the organization has faced a great deal of controversy and continues to do so today. The disagreement centers around accusations of, on the one hand, the leftist bias of books, and on the other of suppressing cultural and heritage history of India and attempted saffronizing of Indian history. Allegations of historical revisionism with a Hindu nationalist plan arose in two terms: under the Janata Party government 1977 to 1980 and again under the Bharatiya Janata Party government from 1998 to 2004. In 2012, the organization has been blamed for publishing 'undefensive' cartoons against B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution and thus lodging an insult to the Constitution, in its textbooks. The controversy led to the resignation of NCERT chief advisors Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar and an apology from the government. According to historian Sadanand More, the NCERT, as the zenith organization that provides advice and support for the improvement of school education, has been avoiding mentioning in school history books that about half of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by the Maratha Empire for a period before the British East India Company conquered it.

The nearest town is Helston approximately to the north. Mullion civil parish encompasses the church town (now known simply as Mullion) and four smaller settlements: Mullion Cove and Predannack to the southwest; Trewoon and Meaver to the east. Mullion is bordered by the parishes of Gunwalloe and Cury to the north, Grade-Ruan to the east, Landewednack to the south, and by Mount's Bay to the west. The parish also includes Mullion Island, a uninhabited island approximately half a mile (0.8 km) offshore from Mullion Cove. The island is home to large colonies of seabirds and is owned by the National Trust. Etymology The parish name has evolved over the years, with references in the parish records to St Mullyon, St Mullian, Mullian, Mullyan, Mulion, Mullyon and St Mullion. In the Valor Ecclesiasticus carried out in 1535 the village name is recorded as Melyan.Valor Ecclesiasticus, 1535. \\"National Archives Series E 344\\" The parish takes its name from Saint Melaine, the Breton Bishop of RennesDoble, G. H. (1962) The Saints of Cornwall, Part II. Truro: Dean and Chapter who supposedly took office in 519. He was a man of many aliases including the Latin version, Saint Melanius.Patron Saints Index: Saint Melaine Reference to early publications and the 1908 Ordnance Survey maps show that the parish church was officially known as St Melan's until at least the start of the 20th century.Harvey, E. G. (1875) Mullyon, its History, Scenery and Antiquities. Ordnance Survey Second Edition, 1908, Cornwall Sheet L080. S.E. In the late 19th century, Edmund Harvey (1828-84), Vicar of Mullion, proposed that the parish took its name from 'Mellon' which he believed was an alias of Saint Malo. Saint Malo was a Welshman who moved to Brittany (possibly with his cousin, Saint Samson) where he became Bishop of Aleth (the region now called Saint-Malo) around AD 541.Catholic Encyclopedia: St. MachutusSt. Malo ‚Äì Catholic Online Harvey's ideas have since been discredited. However, an area near one of the ancient chapel sites was known as St Malo's Moor in Harvey's time, and nearby were two fields known as Sampson's Crofts. Harvey was Vicar of Mullion 1865 to 1884; he was an author and musical composer, and interested in church music.Harvey, Edmund George; Dictionary of National Biography, 1891 Mullion was surveyed for the Survey of English Dialects. History Predannack Cross The church of St Mellanus There is evidence for prehistoric burial mounds, Celtic crosses and ancient chapel sites in the parish, and in more recent times evidence of copper and china clay mining, and a World War II airfield at Predannack. Several barrows at Angrowse yielded prehistoric remains when excavated.Guide to South Cornwall. London, Ward, Lock, [c. 1955]; p. 72 There is a Cornish cross near the hamlet of Predannack. It has a broad Latin cross on the front and an incised Latin cross on the back.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 283-84 The existence of a Celtic church here is indicated by the place-names Tremenehee (meaning \\"sanctuary town\\") and Lanfrowder (cognate with Lafrowda, the Cornish name of St Just in Penwith) nearby. In Norman times the church of St Melanus lay in the fief of Rosewick; John de Rivers gave it to Mottesfont Priory in 1291 but in 1309 the priory conveyed it to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter. The vicarage was established in 1310 and the chancel of the church was rebuilt before 1331 by the executors of Bishop Bytton of Exeter. Of this chancel part remains but most of the church was built in the 15th century. Robert Luddra (vicar 1512-47) was also provost of Glasney College; he increased the endowment of the vicarage, and contributed funds for the roofs and tower. Features of interest include the fine series of bench ends and other old woodwork.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 168 Mullion in relation to neighbouring parishes In the six years up to 1873 there were nine wrecks along a mile-and-a-half stretch of coastline under Mullion cliffs with the loss of sixty-nine lives. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Mullion Cove in 1867 but was withdrawn in 1908. The boat house has since been demolished but its barometer is on display in the village. Like many other Cornish coastal villages there was a pilchard fishery, controlled by seining companies which started in the 18th century out of Mullion Cove. Caught by a seine net, the pilchards were cured at Newlyn and exported to Mediterranean countries. The companies posted a huer (a lookout) on Mullion Island to watch for the dark patch of a nearby shoal of pilchards. There are still a few boats operating a small shellfish industry. There were a few short-lived copper mines in Mullion parish; first mentioned in a deed of 1741 and the mine(s) had a number of names; Ghost Croft, Goosecroft, Predannack Wartha, South Wheal Unity, Trenance and Wheal Providence. Wheal Unity (or Goosecroft), to the south of Churchtown, opened in 1847, and to the south-east of Pollurian Cove was a mid-19th-century copper mine called Wheal Fenwick. A native copper sheet, found in 1847, and with the dimensions of 9m x 1.4m x 15 cm and weighing over 700 kg, from Wheal Unity was exhibited at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London. Compared with the rest of Cornwall copper mining was insignificant and ceased by the end of the 19th century. The mine buildings have disappeared but an adit can still be seen in Mullion Cove. Talc was quarried in Soapy Cove in the south of the parish during the 18th century. The talc, occurs as a vein in the serpentine, and forms an irregular scar heading from the shore inland. It was used for early porcelain production by Benjamin Lund in Bristol and taken over by the Worcester Porcelain Manufacturers in 1752. Poldhu is the site of one of the main technological advances of the early twentieth century when in 1901, a wireless signal was sent to St John's, Newfoundland, by Marconi. The technology was a precursor to radio, television, satellites and the internet, with the earth station at Goonhilly Downs a nearby example. Geography Mullion Island viewed from the harbour at Mullion Cove The harbour at Mullion Cove The parish comprises of land, of water and of foreshore.GENUKI, 2007. \\"Mullion.\\" It is on the Lizard Peninsula, which lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Mullion contains three designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) ‚Äì West Lizard SSSI, Baulk Head to Mullion SSSI and Mullion Cliff to Predannack Cliff SSSI, which includes Mullion Island. Mullion Cliff to Predannack Cliff SSSI is noted for its geological and biological interest and contains ten Red Data Book of rare and endangered plant species. Much of the Lizard National Nature Reserve (NNR) is within the parish boundary. The South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south-west England from Somerset to Dorset passes by on the cliffs along the western edge of the parish. Mullion Churchtown The main village of Mullion is situated in the north of the parish, approximately 65 metres above sea level and about inland of the coast which is to its west. The village sits at the end of two river valleys which run southwest from the village, descending steeply to meet the sea at Polurrian Cove and Mullion Cove. North of the village is a third river valley descending west to east and meeting the sea at Poldhu Cove. This river defines the boundary between Mullion and the neighbouring parish of Gunwalloe. The geology of this part of the parish consists mainly of Hornblende Schists, only changing to slate north of Poldhu Cove. The land around the village and on the upper slopes of the river valleys is mostly fertile land cultivated for arable crops and livestock grazing. The small hamlets of Trewoon and Meaver are situated about half a mile to the east of Mullion village. Today Mullion is the largest village on the Lizard Peninsula and is a centre for local services and amenities as well as a popular tourist destination. Mullion School is the local secondary school. Predannack Downs The coastline at the edge of Predannack Downs To the south of the village the land gently rises and levels out onto a plateau at a height of around above sea level. In contrast to the northern part of the parish this area remains as semi-natural heath, the growth of which is encouraged by the change in geology south of Mullion Cove to magnesium rich serpentine rock. Known as Predannack Downs, it is part of the Lizard National Nature Reserve. In the centre of the downs lies the World War II, Predannack Airfield, currently a satellite of nearby RNAS Culdrose. The southern extent of the parish is marked by a steep, narrow river valley cut into the downs, meeting the sea at Kynance Cove. The coastline along the edge of the downs between Kynance Cove and Mullion Cove consists of high dramatic sheer cliffs with the exception of a deep narrow cleft cut into the Downs at Gew-graze, also known as Soapy Cove. This cove is named after Soapstone (or talc), a type of serpentine rock found around the cove. Talc was quarried here in the 18th century. Governance For the purposes of local government Mullion is a civil parish and every four years elects a parish council consisting of ten councillors. The principal local authority is Cornwall Council and an electoral ward with the same name covers the parish and the surrounding land to Lizard Point. The population of the ward, at the 2011 census, was 4,364. Sports Mullion AFC is an association football club playing their home matches at Clifton Parc. The first team play in the Cornwall Combination League, the reserves in the Trelawny League and a women's team in the Cornwall Women's Football League. Mullion Cricket Club play in the fourth tier of the Cornwall Cricket League; Division 3 West. Mullion Golf Club was founded in 1895 and is the most southerly golf course in the UK. It is situated in the parish of Gunwalloe.

Sanlaap is a developmental organisation that works towards correction of social imbalances which present themselves as gender injustice and violence against women and children. The primary work is focused against trafficking of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and forced prostitution. As part of its work, the group starts shops to train girls to make a living and foster their independence. History In 1987 a group of researchers and teachers decided to work for the rights of women and female children. In 1989‚Äì90, a study of sexually abused females in Calcutta and its suburbs revealed that girls who were sexually abused when they came in search of work as domestic help and in other forms of employment, often ended up in red light areas. The plight of girls who had been trafficked, tricked and forced into child prostitution became the focus of Sanlaap's work. Interacting with women in prostitution (WIP) revealed the need of these women to find a safe place for their children while they were busy during evening hours. The idea of a Drop in Centre (DIC) came out as a need expressed by the women in prostitution. Today, Sanlaap runs 14 DICs (drop in centres) in 11 red light districts of Kolkata and its outskirts under its Education Programme (SOPAN). Mothers in the red light areas of Kolkata voiced concerns that their girls in the age group 12‚Äì13 years drop out of schools and get married, and are eventually deserted by husband, often left with a child. They then join the women in prostitution for survival. The women living there also explained how they were trafficked by their husbands, families and friends using the false leads of marriage and employment. They wanted their female children to be safe and out of prostitution and the sex industry. The idea of a shelter home evolved through this experience, and the first shelter home was started in July 1993. There are three‚ÄîSNEHA (\\"Affection\\")‚ÄîShelter Homes in Kolkata and the two districts which house more than 150 girls who are minors rescued from prostitution, children of women in prostitution and vulnerable girls rescued from sexual abuse. Mental Health Intervention Programme through Counselling (1995‚Äì96), Vocational skills leading to production (SRIJONI) and economic empowerment, dance as therapy (SANVED), formal and non-formal education are some major interventions and projects of the organisation. Networking is seen as an integral part of Sanlaap Activities; it is believed that Human Rights of individuals or groups cannot be achieved and trafficking cannot be stopped unless and until all groups network with each other and protest the violence of trafficking and forced prostitution, where major victims are under 18 years of age. Sanlaap also networks with the different Government structures and the Panchayats stop trafficking of children and women. Sanlaap believes that trafficking and forced prostitution is organised crime and prostitution cannot become work in the South Asian Region. Women and children discriminated by the family and society are bought and sold as commodities in this region and although there are legal bans on traditional and religious prostitution, the implementation has been very weak and female children are forced into brothel prostitution. Natural calamities, political disturbances and civil wars force hundreds of women and girls to take to the streets and many are trafficked for prostitution and dangerous bonded labor practices in the South Asian Countries. Female children and women are often uneducated and unemployed, hence undergoing discrimination at all levels. As a consequence they have vulnerabilities which force them to migrate and many are trafficked during this time. Corruption is rampant at every level and if prostitution is accepted as work, the madam-pimp-brothel owner-trafficker nexus will be strengthened and more girls will find their way into forced prostitution. The demand age for prostitution is the age of sixteen. The core of Sanlaap's campaign against trafficking in women and girls for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation is to provide psychosocial rehabilitation of child victims of prostitution, whether they or their mothers are engaged in it. Interventions in Calcutta's red light areas are aimed at building access to communities where prostitutes live and providing services to such women and their children to ensure their access to education, health and protection from abuse and exploitation. Sanlaap runs two homes for children rescued from, or vulnerable to, prostitution, a hostel for young working women, and a receiving centre for girls rescued from prostitution. The organisation also works with the Panchayats in source areas for trafficking, developing systems and mechanisms to protect vulnerable women and children from being trafficked and to ensure safe passage for those migrating in search of work or because of marriage. Sneha is a home for girls rescued from prostitution, and the female children of women engaged in prostitution who may be vulnerable to second- generation prostitution. The home aims to allow the girls to assess their situation while also dealing with various health issues. The youth programme's peer support groups among the children of women in prostitution continue to meet regularly. The Kidderpore group has formed a working relationship with the local police to identify trafficked girls and older women who force children into prostitution. Sanlaap intends to support this group further so that its members can take control of situations as they arise in their area. The success of Sanlaap's legal counselling centre at the Watgunge police station in Calcutta has increased demand for similar services at other police stations. Sanlaap continues to agitate for reform within the juvenile justice board. It has joined a network that aims to set minimum standards for quality of care in institutions for children. Sanlaap's legal aid wing also continues to pursue the speedy disposal of legal cases involving girls living under state custody. AIDS More than 19% of the girls rescued from brothel prostitution living in Sneha Shelters are HIV positive, discarded by their families and the Government Homes. Some have given birth to children at the age of fourteen and fifteen. Legal Aid SALAH (\\"advice\\"), the Legal Aid Wing was born in 1996 to provide assistance in cases of domestic violence, maintenance, child custody and women's rights for all women (except property and tenancy disputes). The focus in 1999 shifted to Campaign and Advocacy initially in the source areas. The Campaign and Advocacy (SAHAYOG) sets up Child Protection Units (CPUs), works towards safe migration and networks with Community Based Organisations in the source areas. From 1998, Sanlaap began working with the Panchayat and the District Administration, Police and he Border Security Force, sensitising them and motivating them into taking measures for protection of children and women vulnerable to trafficking and ensuring safe migration. Economic rehabilitation of survivors of trafficking has special importance today where Sanlaap works in collaboration with the Private and the Public sector. SUNDAR SUNDAR was initiated in 2000 as a support group for Women in Prostitution to address the problems of WIP in the red-light areas. The women are supported to attain their identity in the form of voters‚Äô identity card and ration card and are also supported to live a life with dignity without being abused and exploited by local hoodlums, pimps, customers, police and their live-in boyfriends or husbands.

Association with colonialism For earlier history see Catholic Church in Kongo. The church's penetration of the country at large is a product of the colonial era. The Belgian colonial state authorized and subsidized the predominantly Belgian Catholic missions to establish schools and hospitals throughout the colony; the church's function from the perspective of the state was to accomplish Belgium's \\"civilizing mission\\" by creating a healthy, literate, and disciplined work force, one that was obedient to the governing authorities. From the perspective of the church, evangelization was the primary goal, and the number of converts baptized was the measure of its success. Although different in emphasis, church and state goals were sufficiently complementary that the state and church were perceived by the population as sharing the same purpose. As Joseph Cardinal Malula, who was for many years the head of the church in Zaire, put it, \\"For our people, the Church was the State, and the State was the Church.\\" When independence came in 1960, the bill for church collaboration came due; Catholic personnel were the frequent subjects of attacks by angry Congolese throughout the country, while Protestant missionaries and Kimbanguist personnel were, outside of Bas-Za√Øre Region, largely spared. The Catholic Church distances itself from the state The Church's reversal of its role in relation to the state since independence has been striking. Formerly a reliable ally, it has increasingly become the state's most severe institutional critic. Overt conflict first erupted in 1971 when the state, as part of its efforts to centralize and extend its authority, nationalized the country's three universities, including the Catholic Church's Lovanium University outside Kinshasa. State attempts to implant sections of the official party's youth movement, the Youth of the Popular Revolutionary Movement (Jeunesse du Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution‚ÄîJMPR), in Catholic seminaries were strongly resisted. The conflict intensified in 1972 when, as part of the authenticity campaign, all Zairians were ordered to drop their Christian baptismal names and adopt African ones. Cardinal Malula protested the decision and told his bishops to ignore it. The regime retaliated by forcing the cardinal into exile for three months and by seizing his residence and converting it into JMPR headquarters. In addition, the state banned all religious publications and youth groups. Following a brief thaw in 1973 and early 1974, during which the cardinal was permitted to return from exile, relations between church and state continued to deteriorate. The state declared that Christmas would no longer be a Zairian holiday, banned religious instruction from the schools, and ordered crucifixes and pictures of the pope removed from schools, hospitals, and public buildings; the removed items were replaced by pictures of President Mobutu. The president was characterized by the regime as a new messiah, and the state took over direct control of the nation's schools. Courses in Mobutism supplanted courses in religious instruction. Students in the former church schools found themselves participating in daily rallies led by JMPR members, during which they were obliged to chant \\"Mobutu awa, Mobutu kuna, Mobutu partout\\" (Mobutu here, Mobutu there, Mobutu everywhere). Return of Church schools The tables turned in late 1975 as the effects of Zairianization and the fall in copper prices resulted in a progressively worsening economy. As living standards fell, more and more state officials exploited their positions to steal from the citizenry. Catholic clergy issued public denunciations of these exactions. Increasingly pointed pastoral letters denouncing state corruption were published by all of Zaire's bishops in 1977 and 1978. Meanwhile, although privately furious at such criticism, Mobutu was preoccupied with the deteriorating economy and the invasions of Shaba Region. In addition, the state's lack of managerial skills and resources had rendered its takeover of the education system a disaster. Faced with these realities, the president asked religious institutions to resume responsibility for church schools, which, by 1976, they had done. Courses on religion were once again integrated into the curriculum. The Church as voice of opposition to Mobutu and cronyism Tensions remained high throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. The bishops' episcopal letter of June 1981, for example, castigated the regime for corruption, brutality, mismanagement, and lack of respect for human dignity. An angry Mobutu retaliated by warning the Catholic hierarchy to stay out of politics; he also stationed JMPR militants in all places of worship to monitor priestly homilies. Coincidentally, attacks and attempted attacks were launched during the following months by unknown parties against several highly placed Catholic clerics; Cardinal Malula's home, for example, was attacked and his night watchman killed. The cardinal advised Zairians before the 1984 presidential elections to consult their consciences before casting their ballots; his act was denounced by the government as religious zealotry. Tensions would have been still greater but for divisions within the Church and for the ambiguity of the Church's role relative to the state. Conflict within the Church exists between the lower clergy, who are in day-to-day contact with the population, and the higher clergy; the former argued for a more radical structural critique of the regime, while the latter prevailed in arguing for a more limited, moral criticism. Many bishops wished to protect the church's institutional position and to avoid the retaliation that a more militant attack on the state could well provoke. Financial dependency High church officials enjoyed many of the economic and social privileges of other prominent Zairians. In addition, the Church continued to depend on grants from foreign sources; as of 1976, none of Zaire's forty-seven dioceses was financially self-sufficient, a situation of dependency that appeared little changed by the early 1990s. The dependence of the largely Africanized church leadership on substantial numbers of expatriate priests, nuns, and brothers at lower and middle staff levels was another weakness. Finally, while church officials generally sided with the populace against the government in labor disputes, tax revolts, and individual cases of injustice, they sometimes made common cause with the regime; in its management role in Catholic schools, for example, the Church found itself siding with the government against teachers striking for higher wages in the early 1980s. The Zaire Use Children dance during Mass at Basankusu Cathedral, DRC. The Zaire Use, or Zairan Rite (Rite Za√Ørois), that which perhaps now can be called the Congolese Rite, is a variation of the Roman Rite. It was approved by Rome in 1988. This liturgy fits into Congolese culture. People are involved in the liturgy because they feel recognised and considered. It takes into account African life and culture. The Zaire Use encourages the participation of the congregation. The engagement of the faithful by, for example, dance, can be seen as an expression of faith.The Rite Zairois (pdf, English). Another aspect is the invocation of ancestors and the saints which forms an important part of liturgy in the Congo. It is an eschatological affirmation of the Christian assembly as well as a part of the Congolese culture. A third characteristic of the liturgical celebration is that readers receive a blessing given as a mandate by the priest, before going up to read.Kabongo, Edouard: Le rite za√Ørois de la messe.

Hanley with lyrics by Ballard MacDonald that was published in January 1917. Although it is not the state song of Indiana (which is \\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\\"), it is perhaps the best-known song that pays tribute to the Hoosier state.  An Indiana signature  The tune was introduced as a Tin Pan Alley pop song of the time. It contains a musical quotation from the already well known \\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\\", as well as repetition of words from the lyrics: candlelight, moonlight, fields, new-mown hay, sycamores, and the Wabash River. Since 1946, \\"Back Home Again in Indiana\\" has been performed during pre-race ceremonies before the Indianapolis 500. From 1972 to 2014, the song was performed most often by Jim Nabors. He admitted to having the song's lyrics written on his hand during his inaugural performance, and occasionally his versions altered several of the words. The vocals are supported by the Purdue All-American Marching Band. In 2014, Nabors performed the song for the final time after announcing his retirement earlier that year, saying: \\"You know, there's a time in life when you have to move on. I'll be 84 this year. I just figured it was time ... This is really the highlight of my year to come here. It's very sad for me, but nevertheless there's something inside of me that tells me when it's time to go.\\" After Nabors retired, the honor of singing the song was done on a rotating basis (which had also been the case prior to Nabors becoming the regular singer) in 2015 and 2016. A cappella group Straight No Chaser performed in 2015 and the Spring 2014 winner of The Voice Josh Kaufman performed in 2016. The Speedway has returned to a standard singer starting in 2017, with Jim Cornelison doing it for four runnings as of the 2020 race.  A jazz standard  Columbia 78 by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, 1917 In 1917 it was one of the current pop tunes selected by Columbia Records to be recorded by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, (ODJB), who released it as a 78 with \\"Darktown Strutters' Ball\\". This lively instrumental version by the ODJB was one of the earliest jazz records issued and sold well. The tune became a jazz standard. For years, Louis Armstrong and his All Stars would open every public performance with the number. Its chord changes undergird the Charlie Parker composition \\"Donna Lee\\", one of jazz's best known contrafacts, a composition that lays a new melody over an existing harmonic structure.

Retrieved on 21 December 2013. Several chords can be observed to have been incorrectly identified. On beat four of measure five, the chord is identified as G dim, but the notes are C# (doubled in the bass), Bb, E. Since there is no G in the music and the doubling of the C# suggests that note as the root, it is a C# dim7 in name (the same notes as a G dim7), and acts as a type of altered IV chord. Since it sits on beat four of a IV chord measure, it is acting as a passing chord to the I chord of measure 2. Measure 11 of the chorus is notated with an Adim on beat 4, but with a D# doubled in the bass in the sheet music, it is more correctly notated as D#dim. They have the same notes, and this leaves the cord as an altered V chord, with D# as the root, which allows the bass line to move chromatically from D7 up to Em. Measure 12 of the chorus ends with an Eb7, which agrees with the notes on the page, but it is worth noting as an altered VI chord, carrying the bass line back down 1/2 step to the enharmonic version of the D# used on the way up from D to E. In the second A section of the chorus, measures 14 and 15 are notated with Em, Edim, G, and D9. Edim would have E G A# (and C# for the full chord), but the notes in the sheet music are C doubled in the left hand, indicating a C root, and B and F# in the right hand. Thus, it cannot be Edim at all. The closest chord with those notes is C#7sus4 (C# F# G# B), which has one added note, the G#. Since the root, 4th and 7th are the defining notes, it would be easy to leave out the fifth, which would be implied in the overtones of the root, anyway. This is a slight variation from the vi II V7 I progression one might expect in a 32 bar song With the E in the right hand in measure 15, the D chord is a 9th, not a 7th as indicated in the later publication.

They were once considered to be a branch of a Khoisan language family, and were known as Central Khoisan in that scenario. Though Khoisan is now rejected as a family, the name is retained as a term of convenience. The most numerous and only well known Khoe language is Khoekhoe (Nama/Damara) of Namibia. The rest of the family is found predominantly in the Kalahari Desert of Botswana. The languages are similar enough that a fair degree of communication is possible between Khoekhoe and the languages of Botswana. The Khoe languages were the first Khoisan languages known to European colonists and are famous for their clicks, though these are not as extensive as in other Khoisan language families. There are two primary branches of the family, Khoekhoe of Namibia and South Africa, and Tshu‚ÄìKhwe of Botswana and Zimbabwe. Except for Nama, they are under pressure from national or regional languages such as Tswana. History Tom G√ºldemann believes agro- pastoralist people speaking the Khoe‚ÄìKwadi proto-language entered modern-day Botswana about 2000 years ago from the northeast (that is, from the direction of the modern Sandawe), where they had likely acquired agriculture from the expanding Bantu, at a time when the Kalahari was more amenable to agriculture. The ancestors of the Kwadi (and perhaps the Damara) continued west, whereas those who settled in the Kalahari absorbed speakers of Juu languages. Thus the Khoe family proper has a Juu influence. These immigrants were ancestral to the north-eastern Kalahari peoples (Eastern Tshu‚ÄìKhwe branch linguistically), whereas Juu neighbours (or perhaps Kx ºa neighbours more generally) to the southwest who shifted to Khoe were ancestral to the Western Tshu‚ÄìKhwe branch. Later desiccation of the Kalahari led to the adoption of a hunter-gatherer economy and preserved the Kalahari peoples from absorption by the agricultural Bantu when they spread south. Those Khoe who continued southwestwards retained pastoralism and became the Khoekhoe. They mixed extensively with speakers of Tuu languages, absorbing features of their languages. This has resulted in Tuu and Kx'a substrata in the Khoekhoe languages. The expansion of the Nama people into Namibia and their absorption of client peoples such as the Damara and Hai«Åom took place in the 16th century and later, at about the time of European contact and colonization. Classification The nearest relative of the Khoe family may be the extinct Kwadi language of Angola. This larger group, for which pronouns and some basic vocabulary have been reconstructed, is called Kwadi‚ÄìKhoe. However, because Kwadi is poorly attested, it is difficult to tell which common words are cognate and which might be loans. Beyond that, the nearest relative may be the Sandawe isolate; the Sandawe pronoun system is very similar to that of Kwadi‚ÄìKhoe, but there are not enough known correlations for regular sound correspondences to be worked out. However, the relationship has some predictive value, for example if the back-vowel constraint, which operates in the Khoe languages but not in Sandawe, is taken into account. Language classifications may list one or two dozen Khoe languages. Because many are dialect clusters, there is a level of subjectivity involved in separating them. Counting each dialect cluster as a unit results in nine Khoe languages: *Nama (ethnonyms Khoekhoe, Nama, Damara) is a dialect cluster including «ÇAakhoe and Hai«Åom *Xiri is a dialect cluster also known as Griqua (Afrikaans spelling) or Cape Hottentot. *Shua is a dialect cluster including Shwa, Deti, Ts ºixa, «ÄXaise, and Gan√°di *Tsoa is a dialect cluster including Cire Cire and Kua *Kxoe is a dialect cluster including «ÅAni and Buga *Naro is a dialect cluster *G«Åana is a dialect cluster including G«Äwi. «ÇHaba is often included here, but may be closer to Naro. *Ts ºixa: it is not yet clear if Ts ºixa is closest to Shua or to Khoe. Dozens of names are associated with the Tshu‚ÄìKhwe languages, especially with the Eastern cluster. These may be place, clan or totem names, often without any linguistically identifiable data. Examples include Masasi, Badza, Didi, and Dzhiki.E. O. J. Westphal, \\"The Linguistic Prehistory of Southern Africa: Bush, Kwadi, Hottentot, and Bantu Linguistic Relationships\\", Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, vol. 33, no. 3 (Jul. 1963), pp. 237‚Äì265. It is not presently possible to say which languages correspond to which names mentioned in the anthropological literature, though the majority will likely turn out to be Shua or Tshua.Yvonne Treis, \\"Names of Khoisan Languages and their Variants\\" In most of the Eastern Kalahari Khoe languages, the alveolar and palatal clicks have been lost, or are in the process of being lost. For example, the northern dialect of Kua has lost palatal clicks, but the southern dialect retains them. In Ts ºixa, the change has created doublets with palatal clicks vs palatal plosives. The nearest relative of the Khoe family may be the extinct Kwadi language of Angola. This larger group, for which pronouns and some basic vocabulary have been reconstructed, is called Khoe‚ÄìKwadi.

The Catholic Church in Ukraine () is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. The majority of Catholics in Ukraine belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, while significant numbers of others belong to the Latin Church (known as Roman Catholic), Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, or Armenian Catholic Church. Types of Catholic churches by rite * Roman Rite: Roman Catholic Church (Latin province of Lviv) * Armenian rite: Armenian Catholic Church (Armenian Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv) * Byzantine rite: Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church (Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo) History and data The Catholic Church in Ukraine consists of members of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church as well as the Roman (Latin Rite) Catholic Church in Ukraine, Ruthenian Catholic Church, and the Armenian Catholic Church. The majority of Ukrainian Catholics belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church in the territories of modern Ukraine has been strongly associated with Poland and Poles, but the church has emphasized a Ukrainian identity since the nation's independence from the Soviet Union. The history of the Catholic Church in modern Ukraine starts as early as the 10th century when Christianity in Ruthenia was established as a state religion in 988 taking place before the East‚ÄìWest Schism. While records of Christians and Christian temples in the Medieval state predate the date. In mid 10th century Kyiv was visited by a mission that was led by bishop Adalbert of Magdeburg out of Trier Monastery. Following the schism, the Ruthenian Church which was brought to Kyiv by the Byzantine Greeks ended up among Eastern Orthodox Churches. After annexation of the Kingdom of Ruthenia by the Kingdom of Poland in course of the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars in Lviv was established the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv in the 14th century. In mid 15th century Metropolitan of Kyiv Isidore attempted to unite the Ruthenian Church with the Catholic world by attending the Council of Florence. Due to the conflict with the Grand Duchy of Moscow, in 1458 the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Isidore II reorganized the Ruthenian Church moving its metropolitan see to Vilnius. Until 1480 the metropolitan see of the Church was held by a metropolitan bishop appointed by the Pope including Gregory the Bulgarian and Misail Pstruch. In 1595 there was signed the Union of Brest which officially united the Ruthenian Church with the Catholic Church accomplishing the intent of Metropolitan Isidore. Following partitions of Poland, in 1839 in Polotsk pressured by the Russian government most of bishops of the Ruthenian Uniate Church signed the union with the Patriarchate of Moscow, while diocese that became part of the Austrian Empire were reorganized as Greek-Catholic Church. In 1630 a bishop of Armenian Apostolic Church Miko≈Çaj Torosowicz also signed a union with the Catholic Church establishing Armenian Catholic diocese of Lwow. In 1646 another Eastern Orthodox diocese of Mukachevo signed the Union of Uzhhorod and for sometime was guided by the Archbishop of Eger in Hungary. In 2001, Ukraine was visited by Pope John Paul II, who held official and informal meetings in Kyiv and Lviv.Ukraine Remembers Visit of John Paul II, Zenit News Agency, June 2006 Obviously the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Latin Church in the country warmly greeted a visit from their spiritual father. Non-Catholic religious communities expressed hope that the visit would encourage a spiritual and cultural renewal in a country troubled by economic and social problems.Ukraine responds to the Papal Visit, Religious Information Service of Ukraine Catholic charity Caritas Spes (by 2007 information) functions in 12 regions of the country, has 40 centers engaging 500 employees and volunteers.Sixteen Years a Short Period to Learn the Charity Habit, Interview with Caritas-Spes Head of Ukraine, RISU Portal, September 2007 It runs six family-style homes for orphans with 60 children, financed health rehabilitation camps situated in environmentally healthful areas around Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Transcarpathian regions, benefits 2,500 children each year. About 12,000 Ukrainian children, mainly victims of Chernobyl, orphans, and children from poor families, had their health improved in this way in 2002‚Äì2007. In 2005 the number of Catholics was estimated at around 4 million 760 thousand people, which represents 7.3% of the population. Of these, about 4 million are Greek Catholics, and 500-800 thousand Catholics of the Latin rite. There is also a small Armenian Catholic community, although before the Second World War the number of Armenian Catholics in Lviv was significant. A characteristic feature of Ukrainian Catholicism is the predominance of Greek Catholic believers over Latin Catholics. Ukraine is the only country in Europe where Catholics of the Eastern rite prevail over Roman Catholics Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is a Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See. The ordinary (or hierarch) of the church holds the title of Major Archbishop of Kyiv-Halych and All Ruthenia, though the hierarchs and faithful of the church have acclaimed their ordinary as \\"Patriarch\\" and have requested Papal recognition of, and elevation to, this title. Major archbishop is a unique title within the Catholic Church that was introduced in 1963 as part of political compromise. Since March 2011 the head of the church is Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk.

History  Palladio was asked to design and build the palazzo by Count Girolamo Chiericati. The architect started building the palace in 1550, and some further work was completed under the patronage of Chiericati's son, Valerio. However, the palazzo was not fully finished until about 1680, possibly by Carlo Borella. Palladio also designed a country home, the Villa Chiericati, for the family. The palazzo was built in an area called \\"piazza dell'Isola\\" (island square, currently Piazza Matteotti), which housed the wood and cattle market. At that time, it was an islet surrounded by the Retrone and Bacchiglione streams, and to protect the structure from the frequent floods, Palladio designed it on an elevated position: the entrance could be accessed by a triple Classic-style staircase.  Architecture  The palazzo's principal fa√ßade is composed of three bays, the central bay projecting slightly. The two end bays have logge on the piano nobile level, while the central bay is closed. The fa√ßade has two superposed orders of columns, Doric on the lower level with Ionic above. The roof line is decorated by statuary.

It provided undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the arts, humanities, business studies, teacher training, health and social care. In 2006 the College was granted the power to award its own degrees (prior to this they were accredited by Lancaster University). On 1 August 2007, the College merged with other institutions to form the University of Cumbria. History St Martin's College opened in 1964, founded by the Church of England as a College of Education to train teachers, one of only two Church Colleges to be established in the 20th Century. Built on the former site of Bowerham Barracks, the College opened with 89 students. The College was officially opened by the Queen Mother in 1967. The College is named after St Martin of Tours, a Roman soldier who tore his cloak in two to clothe a naked beggar and later had a vision of Christ wearing the cloak. It is significant because just as St Martin renounced his life as a soldier after this to take on a life of caring and teaching, Bowerham Barracks left behind its military past to become a Church College. The college's founder Principal was Dr Hugh Pollard, who stayed with the College until his retirement in 1976. He had overseen the College‚Äôs establishment and led it through its formative years. The student population had grown to 700 students by the time of Dr Pollard‚Äôs retirement. He was replaced by Robert Clayton, who had been previously Principal of Matlock College in Derbyshire. During his time in charge, the college branched out into Health, Radiography and Nursing courses, areas that would form a substantial part of the College‚Äôs provision from then on. In 1989, Mr Clayton announced his intention to retire. His replacement was Dr Ian Edynbry, formerly Vice-Principal of Worcester College of Higher Education and Assistant Principal at Middlesex Polytechnic. Dr. Edynbry was to oversee the College‚Äôs greatest expansion to date, as St Martin‚Äôs started to establish campuses in Cumbria. In 1996, Charlotte Mason College in Ambleside became part of St Martin‚Äôs College to become its first campus in Cumbria. This was soon followed in 1998 by the College‚Äôs acquisition of Carlisle‚Äôs former City General Hospital and City Maternity Hospital (originally a Workhouse) on Fusehill Street. The College had been active in Carlisle since 1995, since its takeover of the Lakeland College of Nursing. The Carlisle Campus has subsequently been redeveloped with modern facilities including en-suite student accommodation, a sports complex and most recently the Learning Gateway, a building kitted out with state-of-the-art IT to aid flexible and distributed learning. It was left to Edynbry's successor to take these new campus developments forward, as he announced he was to retire earlier than expected in 1997. The new Principal was Professor Chris Carr, whose previous role was as Pro-Vice Chancellor of University of Central Lancashire. Professor Carr took on the challenge of bringing cohesion to a diverse and multi-campus institution, whilst encouraging further diversification and expansion. Developments have been constant on each campus during that time, with new sports complexes built in Carlisle and Lancaster, a new library named the Charlotte Mason Library on the Ambleside Campus and new en-suite halls of residence built on the Carlisle Campus. The Alexandra Building was opened on the Lancaster Campus in 2004, a teaching and learning block with dedicated facilities for the arts. As of 2005, over 11,500 students studied at St Martin‚Äôs College, which employed over 1000 staff. The College had a substantial national reputation in teacher training and nursing, as the largest provider of teachers in the UK and a major provider of Health Care Practitioners in the North and North-West. Academic portfolio The College had a significant undergraduate and postgraduate portfolio with degrees accredited by Lancaster University. As the largest provider of Higher Education in Cumbria, St Martin‚Äôs College offered a wide range of courses from the traditional academic subjects to Sport Studies, British Psychological Society (BPS) accredited Psychology, Information Technology and Environmental Management, to name just a few. Locations The college was located in the historic cities of Lancaster and Carlisle and in the Lake District. There are a wide range of clubs, bars and other activities available, as well as a variety of outdoor activities in the Lake District. New buildings including a new library and learning resource centre in Ambleside, a modern sports centre in Carlisle and purpose built teaching facilities in Lancaster were added in the 2000s, totalling over ¬£20 million. Merger St Martin's College, Cumbria Institute of the Arts and the Cumbrian sites of the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) in Carlisle and Penrith amalgamated to form the University of Cumbria on 1 August 2007. This was instigated by a HEFCE (Higher Education Funding Council for England) report by Sir Martin Harris, published in September 2005, which recommended the amalgamation of the two institutions (UCLan's involvement came about after the report was published) to best serve the higher education needs of Cumbria. Campus closure On 1 December 2009, it was announced that the Ambleside Campus would be 'mothballed' at the end of July 2010, and would no longer take new undergraduate students. The action by the University of Cumbria, if seen through, would have ended over 175 years of heritage and a protest was held on 1 December 2009 by the student body, with more actions following by students, the townspeople of Ambleside, and in spite of the support that Tim Farron MP gave to the campus and students. > \\"Hundreds of local people have signed this petition and that shows how > committed the community is to stopping this closure from happening. Now that > the issue has national attention, I hope that the University will take > notice of level of protest against this proposal and will reconsider their > decision to downgrade Ambleside Campus...\\" Tim Farron, speaking in the Commons. In July 2011, the university announced a plan to reopen the Ambleside campus and increase student numbers, and this began in 2014. The campus now runs a variety of environmental, forestry, business and outdoor education courses.

Although the design is generally attributed to Ivatt they were actually created in the last year of Alexander McDonnell's tenure. Design The decision to proceed with an 0-6-0T design was discussed between Ivatt and Aspinall due to issues with preceding 0-6-4T locomotives. Ivatt's design incorporated the same cylinders, coupled-wheels and boilers as the 0-6-4Ts. Service Constraints on the locomotive design meant that the coupled wheelbase had to be as short as possible to negotiate the curves in the dock areas but the locomotive had to have sufficient power available for the increasing load of the trains. Under the system employed by the Great Southern Railways they became Class J11. All of the class survived until 1949, with No. 217 being withdrawn in 1961 and No. 201 withdrawn in 1963.

The national park is located in Western Lapland in the municipalities of Enonteki√∂, Kittil√§, Kolari and Muonio. The landscape of Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park is dominated by a chain of fells stretching for approximately 100 km and the taiga forests in the boreal forest zone. In terms of visits, Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park is Finland's most popular national park. In 2019, the visitor counters recorded 561,200 visits. There are many reasons for the popularity of the national park. According to a visitor survey, visitors to the Pallas- Yll√§stunturi National Park particularly appreciate the landscapes in the area, its extensive network of paths and trails as well as general tidiness and safety. The landscape of Pallastunturi Fells has been chosen as one of Finland's national landscapes.  Hiking opportunities  Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park has dozens of different trails for hiking and skiing that are suitable for people looking for different levels of difficulty. The trails provide a great chance to see the diverse nature of the national park. Some of the trails lead to the top of the fells, while others wind through the forest nature and swamp landscapes of the area. You can walk, mountain bike, paddle, ski and snowshoe in the national park. A diverse range of hiking trails provides the opportunity for day trips of different lengths and longer hikes. In Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park, day hikers can also climb to the top of the fells. Popular day trips include the Pyh√§keron p√§iv√§retki Day Hike, Taivaskeron kierros Circle Trail, Pirunkurun ponnistus Trail, Varkaankurun polku Trail, Kes√§nkij√§rven kierros Circle Trail and Tuomikurun kierros Circle Trail. The majority of the routes are circle trails, and there are serviced campsites on all the trails. The campsites can be Lapp huts, lean-to shelters, campfire sites, scenic locations, as well as wilderness and rental huts. The national park area has a total of 340 kilometres of marked summer hiking trails. Approximately 200 kilometres of summer hiking trails are also located in the vicinity of the national park. With a few exceptions, mountain biking is permitted on marked summer hiking trails. There are over 500 kilometres of ski trails and more than 100 kilometres of winter hiking trails. You can walk, snowshoe and mountain bike on the winter hiking trails. The Hetta-Pallas Trail is the best known hiking trail in the national park ‚Äì and the oldest marked hiking trail in Finland. It was marked in 1934. The Hetta-Pallas Trail is approximately 50 kilometres long, and it can be hiked in either direction. The trail runs along the fell plateaus and descends into ravines. It also takes hikers to the tops of many fells. There are several serviced wilderness and rental huts along the route. The trekking trails and services of Pallas- Yll√§stunturi National Park can be found on ExcursionMap.fi.  Geography and nature  The landscape of Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park is dominated by a chain of fells, which is the remains of an ancient folded mountain range. Today‚Äôs rounded fells are the worn-down bases of those mountains. The highest point in the national park is Taivaskero in the Pallastunturi Fells, which is 809 metres above sea level. Other high summits include Pyh√§kero, Lumikero, Laukukero and Palkaskero. Kero is a Finnish word that refers to the round, treeless top of a fell. The nature in Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park is diverse and varied. The area has several different habitats: mires, heath forests, old-growth forests in their natural state, open fells and herb-rich forests.  Vegetation and waterways  The national park is rich in vegetation. Pine, spruce and fell birch do particularly well in the area. Typical plants in the treeless fell areas include various low-growing plants like dwarf birch, pincushion plants, Alpine bearberry and crowberry. The lush creekside groves are a good place to find plants like downy currant, ostrich fern, garden angelica and mezereum. In terms of dwarf shrubs, blueberry and lingonberry thrive in the heath forests. Wood cranesbill and dwarf cornel as well as many other rare species of moss and fungi grow in the moist old-growth forests. In addition to fells and coniferous forests, mires are a typical landscape in Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park. Many wetland plants, such as Labrador tea, tussock cottongrass, cloudberry and bog bilberry, do well in mires. Rare orchids also grow in the calcareous areas. The national park has many lakes, ponds and streams. The largest lake in the park is Pallasj√§rvi Lake, located southeast of the Pallastunturi Visitor Centre. Large mammals found in the national park include reindeer and elk. During the summer, reindeer in particular spend a lot of time on the fells and in mire areas. Other mammals typically seen in the area are the hare, fox, weasel, Norway lemming, various species of mole and the squirrel. Bear and lynx are two of Finland‚Äôs large predators that live permanently in the Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park area. Northern and southern bird species mix in Pallas- Yll√§stunturi National Park. Northern species include the rock ptarmigan, willow grouse and Eurasian dotterel. Lush spruce forests are a popular location for southern species like the common blackbird and wood warbler. Various tit species, Siberian jays and pine grosbeaks can be seen in the forest. Whenever there are a lot of moles, more owls and hawks can also be observed in the area. A typical inhabitant of streams is the white-throated dipper, which dives into running water to catch its food ‚Äì also in the winter. Other bird species seen in the national park include the bluethroat, wood sandpiper, western yellow wagtail, ruff and spotted redshank.  Weather and natural phenomena  Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park‚Äôs location north of the Arctic Circle means that it experiences the typical weather and natural phenomena associated with seasonal changes. Winter includes a polar night period in December-January, snowfall, freezing temperatures that can drop to -30¬∫C and very little sunlight. On clear evenings and nights, planets, stars and the northern lights may be visible in the sky. The snow cover in the national park is thickest in March-April, when there may be more than one metre of snow on the fells and in the forests. The amount of light increases rapidly in late winter. When spring arrives, the snow melts and the amount of light continues to increase. Summer begins in mid-June, and the midnight sun lights up the area in June-July. The sun doesn‚Äôt set at all during this period. The display of autumn colours usually begins in mid-September in Western Lapland and lasts for two to three weeks. The first snow generally falls sometime after mid-October, but snowdrifts can occasionally be seen during the summer months, especially in the area of the Pallas-Ounastunturi Fells.  Responsibility  Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park has been granted a European Charter 1 certificate for 2013-2018 and for 2019-2023. The certificates have been granted by the EUROPARC Federation. All national parks in Finland follow the principles of litter-free hiking. The aim of litter-free hiking is to ensure that visitors carry their own trash out of the terrain and deliver it to the serviced recycling points. The purpose is to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in nature. There are recycling points at the Pallastunturi, Fell Lapland and Yll√§stunturi Visitor Centres where paper, cardboard, glass and metal waste as well as batteries can be delivered. Biowaste can be composted in dry toilets, and small amounts of combustible waste can be burned at campfire sites. Air purity in Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park is measured at the Finnish Meteorological Institute‚Äôs Sammaltunturi weather station. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), some of the cleanest air in the world is measured at Sammaltunturi weather station. Concentrations of fine particles in the area are less than 4 ¬µg/m3.  Visitor centres  Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park has three visitor centres: Yll√§stunturi Visitor Centre Kellokas, Pallastunturi Visitor Centre and Fell Lapland Visitor Centre in Heta. The customer service officers at the visitor centres provide information on the national park and hiking possibilities. The Me√§n El√§m√§√§ (Our Life), From Forest to Fell Tops, and Vuovjju≈° ‚Äì Wanderers exhibitions present the nature and culture of the area. You can also watch films and see art exhibitions at the visitor centres. Visitors can also purchase nature-themed products.  History  The idea of establishing national parks in Finland was first brought up in 1910. At that time, the management committee for protected forests published a report proposing the establishment of national parks at the Pallastunturi Fells and at Pyh√§tunturi Fell in Pelkosenniemi. Finnish botanist Kaarlo Linkola had a major role in the work to establish a national park in the Pallastunturi Fells area. A proposal to designate the Pallas-Ounastunturi Fells a protected area was approved at the 1928 Parliamentary Days and, after many reports and proposals, Finland's first national parks were finally established in 1938. Pallas-Ounastunturi National Park was one of these first parks. The history of tourism in Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park stretches back to the 1930s, when the first fell skiing courses were organised at Pyh√§kero in the Ounastunturi Fells and at the Pallastunturi Fells. Tourism also increased in √Ñk√§slompolo at the same time. Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park was established in 2005. The new park combined the old Pallas-Ounastunturi National Park, Yll√§s-Aakenus Nature Reserve and nearby areas from other conservation programmes, such as old-growth forests and areas that were part of wetland conservation programmes. Pallas-Ounastunturi National Park ceased to exist at the same time. The total area of the new national park was 1022 km¬≤. The highest point of Yll√§stunturi Fell and the ski resorts located there are not part of the national park area, but the ski resort on Laukukero at Pallastunturi Fell is inside the park.

The band was made up of musicians Shaun Robinson and Rocky O'Reilly. Robinson and O'Reilly were previously members of the now disbanded Belfast group, Torgas Valley Reds. They met in 2003, in Belfast. O'Reilly had been mixing sound and recording Torgas Valley Reds, whom Robinson drummed for. Inspired by their mutual love for Moog synthesizers, vocoders, and airhorns, O'Reilly and Robinson formed Oppenheimer in late 2004, using O'Reilly's spare room to record 3 songs, which they sent to their favourite labels. Oppenheimer's music has been used in various North American television shows, including How I Met Your Mother, in the episode \\"Lucky Penny\\", Ugly Betty, and Gossip Girl. History Origins Robinson and O'Reilly began recording music together in 2004 in Belfast. They claim that Oppenheimer is not actually named for physicist Robert Oppenheimer. Instead, the name was selected because the duo found it to be aurally and visually aesthetic. Their record label, Little Ruddiger Records, comes from Bart's Inner Child, a fifth-season episode of The Simpsons in which self-help guru Brad Goodman believes Bart Simpson's name to be \\"Ruddiger\\". Oppenheimer (2006-2007) Oppenheimer released their eponymous debut album through Bar/None Records in the United States in July 2006, and through Shock Records in Australia and Fabtone in Japan. Oppenheimer was later issued in the UK via Smalltown America with the initial pressing selling out. The album includes a cover of \\"Don't Call Me\\" by Belfast songwriter Tom McShane. The first single from the album was double A-side 7\\", with \\"Breakfast In NYC\\" and \\"Truth Or Dare\\" along with B-side \\"Getting By\\". The vinyl single was released in the UK through Smalltown America in April 2006. A video for \\"Breakfast in NYC\\", directed by Brian Philip Davis was also produced to coincide with the single release. The music video was made available on the Oppenheimer MySpace page. In support of the album, Oppenheimer toured with Regina Spektor, They Might Be Giants, and Architecture in Helsinki. They also played numerous festivals in North America, as well as the Forfey Festival in August 2006 and the Glasgowbury Festival on 21 July 2007. Take The Whole Midrange and Boost It and dissolution (2008-2012) Oppenheimer's second album, titled Take The Whole Midrange and Boost It was released 3 June 2008 on Bar/None in North America and Fantastic Plastic in Europe. The title of the album is apparently a piece of advice from a Dutch sound manager on one of the band's tours. To support their second album, the duo opened for OK Go with Longwave in March 2009 on their Spring Tour, followed by The Presidents of the United States of America in their Nor'easter Tour. The band started recording material for their third album on 19 August 2009. However, on 12 December, Robinson and O'Reilly announced they would be playing for the last time on 19 December. They also scheduled a final EP for early 2010, which was to contain the unfinished material from their previously forthcoming third album. Although it was delayed till 2012, the band's final release, This Racket Takes Its Toll, collects 14 tracks that had not appeared on the duo's first two albums. Post-breakup (2013-present) O'Reilly formed a new band Malibu Shark Attack with rapper Tribe One, from Atlanta, GA featuring guests and collaborators like MC Lars, Dizzy Dustin, Tim Wheeler, Adam WarRock, Rory Friers, Jesse Dangerously, Linley Hamilton and Bee Mick See. They released their debut album in May 2014 on No Dancing Records. O'Reilly is also a producer & mixer, working out of Start Together Studio in Belfast, N.Ireland. He has worked with artists including And So I Watch You From Afar, Wheatus, In Case Of Fire, Gallery Circus, Cashier No. 9 and Math The Band.

Plate 1,‚ÄòWavestone‚Äô at Gortlecka, R32011 94965, The Burren, Co. Clare. Plate 3: ‚ÄòWavestone‚Äô at Cornaseer, M99581 47138, Lough Ree, Co. Roscommon. Plate 4: The Cahir Rock, R27345 89972, Inchiquin Lough, Co. Clare. Mushroom stones, or mushroom rocks, in Ireland are limestone boulders undercut by past weathering regimes. These rocks take the form of solitary sentinels of limestone which still bear the unmistakable marks of long-continued erosion by ice, soil or lapping waves at the edge of lakes which have since vanished or retreated. These stones are sometimes shaped like mushrooms, others have an overhang facing in just one direction, but all are notched and undercut in such a fashion as to suggest prolonged exposure to standing water at some time in the past. The mushroom-shaped stones are produced where the notching forms a fairly even circle around the stone. Where a limestone boulder stands at the edge of a lake so that it is partly covered by water, the underwater part weathers more rapidly than the part above water because it is subject to more constant corrosion by water, accentuated by the abrasive lapping action of waves. If this continues for a long time the upper part will be undercut, and the stone will assume a very distinctive form which is frequently mushroom-like. Much more rarely the same process can be seen in limestone bedrock. Many mushroom stones have a second minor ‚Äòlip‚Äô below the main one, suggesting that the drop in water level which isolated the stones from the lake's edge took place in two stages. Ireland The wavestones in Ireland are always of limestone: generally isolated boulders which are often glacial erratics, or (much more rarely) exposed outcrop. In Ireland, wave stones were first recorded in 1865 by F.J. Foot along the shores of Lough Ree, during the course of field work for the first systematic geological survey of Ireland. He made a drawing of these water-worn limestone blocks ‚Äòeroded up to a certain height by the solvent action of former lake water, showing the level at which Lough Ree once stood ‚Äì 10 to 15 feet higher than the present summer height: the lake shore, moreover, is now some 300 yards distant.‚Äô To date, wavestones have been recorded in Counties Offaly, Tipperary, Galway, Clare, Cork, Limerick, Roscommon and Westmeath (see map below in External Links). Not all mushroom stones are situated close to modern lakes. Many mark the shores of lakes which have vanished altogether, becoming filled in with reedswamp, fen and bog vegetation in the course of time. A remarkable example is located near Crancreagh Bridge in County Offaly, which marks the position of what must have been the north-western edge of ancient Lough Boora, on whose shores the first people of the Irish midlands camped in Mesolithic times 8,500 or so years ago. This ancient lake disappeared long ago, swamped by the growing expanse of bog, which buried not only the lake itself, but preserved the campsites of the early midlanders. Ireland's wavestones No scientific evidence has been published to verify that the Irish wavestones have formed in lakes. Furthermore, no wavestones have been described from present-day lakes in Ireland, which is puzzling as parts of the country, such as The Burren, are studded with lakes containing many partly- submerged Carboniferous limestone erratics. A requirement for limestone solution is that water must essentially be ‚Äòacidic‚Äô (pH below 7). Yet, a study of six wavestone sites in Ireland, namely Ballard Bridge, Cornaseer, Creevagh, Gortlecka, Killinaboy and Rinnamona, found that nearby lakes, in which the wavestones are said to have formed, are ‚Äòalkaline' (pH above 7) with a pH range from 7.6 to 8.5. In fact, the water in three of the lakes, Loughs Geal√°in and Ree, and Rinnamona Lough, is so alkaline that marl (lime mud) is being precipitated. The alkalinity of the lake water means that it would cushion limestone against solution rather than dissolve it. This (and other field evidence, such as wavestone morphology) indicates that the wavestones at these six sites have not formed in lakes. There is ample evidence that undercutting of limestone can result from solution in soil that abuts rock, and measurements of soil water at the six sites showed that it is ‚Äòacidic‚Äô (pH below 7) with a pH range from 5.3 to 6.8. It has been noted that the Irish landscape has been profoundly altered by drainage operations, that signs of peat cutting are common in the Burren fens and that extensive deforestation has occurred in Ireland, all of which can lead to a lowering of the land surface. For instance, the ground in Holme Fen, England, subsided by 1.8m in the first decade after its initial drainage in 1851, a figure that is typical of initial peat subsidence rates. Accordingly, it is proposed that the wavestones at the six sites were undercut by soil water when soil levels were higher than today. It follows, therefore, that the studied wavestones are not, in fact, ‚Äòwavestones'. More accurately, they are mushroom rocks that have formed in a terrestrial setting. Three examples of ‚Äòwavestones‚Äô that illustrate mushroom rock formation in a lost-soil environment and a mid-lake, non-undercut Carboniferous limestone erratic occur respectively at Gortlecka, Creevagh and Cornaseer, and in Inchiquin Lough. The base of the ‚Äòwavestone‚Äô at Gortlecka (Plate 1) is winter-flooded by Lough Geal√°in (pH 8.2), and the horizontal surface of the water contrasts strongly with the sloping and undulating lip. The lake water pH and lip shape both signify that formation cannot have occurred in the lake. Instead, the sharply-defined lip marks the former level of the (undulating) soil surface, below which solution by soil water (pH 6.0) occurred. In contrast, the ‚Äòwavestone‚Äô at Creevagh (Plate 2), which occurs inside a meander of the river Shannon (pH 8.3), seems an obvious candidate for formation in a lake since its lip is horizontal. The lake surface, though, would have to remain at exactly the same height for a remarkably long period to create such a lip, while wave-splash would lead to a rounding of its edges. It is probable that sub-soil solution (pH 5.4) is occurring beneath the coarse grass that abuts the limestone in the foreground. If this is long-continued it would eventually lead to the formation of a dipping lip akin to that on the ‚Äòwavestone‚Äô at Gortlecka. The ‚Äòwavestone' at Cornaseer (Plate 3) is regarded as being the ‚Äòtype‚Äô model,Parkes, M., Meehan, R. & Pr√©teseille, S. (2012): The Geological Heritage of Roscommon. An audit of County Geological Sites in Roscommon. Geological Survey of Ireland. Unpublished Report. P1-34. and its yawning undercut (mean 80 cm deep) is a significant feature. If the undercut had resulted from solution in Lough Ree (pH 8.5) then similar undercutting ought to be present elsewhere alongside the lough at the same height (about 40m above O.D.). None, however, was found, which indicates that solution at Cornaseer was a local phenomenon. It is perhaps significant that the word ‚ÄòBog‚Äô occurs some 300m west of the site on an 1865 survey map and equally significant that the bog no longer exists due to drainage. The mean pH of soil water at Cornaseer is 5.3 and that of neighbouring Clooncraff Bog is 5.8. The three lips represent successive lowering of the soil surface. The Cahir Rock (Plate 4) is a large Carboniferous limestone erratic found in Inchiquin Lough (pH 7.8), which shows no sign of notching by lake water. Nevertheless, solution in a more extensive lake is held responsible for the notching of the ‚Äòwavestones‚Äô at Killinaboy (soil water pH 5.7) some 1 km to the north. Killinaboy lies several metres above the present-day lake level, but Cahir Rock cannot have been overtopped by Inchiquin Lough because its upper surface is etched with rillenkarren, which are a sub-aerial solutional landform It has been pointed out that mushroom-shaped rocks close-to and far-from lakes in Ireland are similarly- shaped, thus the obvious question of whether all of Ireland's mushroom-shaped rocks have developed in a sub-soil environment remains.

Opened in 1874, this long disused railway tunnel was once the UK‚Äôs longest without intermediate ventilation. The tunnel now forms part of the ¬£1.8 million Two Tunnels Greenway walking and cycling path opened on 6 April 2013 and is the longest cycling tunnel in Britain. Its custodian is Wessex Water.  Overview  Combe Down Tunnel in 2005 The tunnel was on the \\"Bath Extension\\" line of the Somerset & Dorset Railway, built in 1874. The extension effectively bankrupted the independent company. The extension line was later made double-track northwards from Evercreech Junction to the viaduct at Midford, but the substantial civil engineering works associated with the tunnel and the steep approach into Bath, including the shorter Devonshire Tunnel, caused the northernmost section to remain single-track throughout its working life. Freight trains heading south from Bath were often banked (assisted in rear) by a locomotive that detached itself from the train at the entrance to Combe Down tunnel, and then returned down the gradient to Bath. This operation was a very rare example of two trains being permitted to run within a single-line section at once, although the train engine carried an electric tablet and the banking engine a staff, both of which had to be returned to their appropriate signalling instruments before other trains could be dispatched into the section. Sometimes the banking engine would be conveying additional goods vehicles for Bath Co-op Siding (situated within the single line section), so the bank engine (carrying the bank staff) would shunt the siding on its way back to Bath Junction whilst the main train (with the single-line tablet) would continue on its way to Midford. This unusual method of working operated right up to the closure of the S&D; in 1966.  Accident  Combe Down tunnel had no intermediate ventilation and there were significant problems with fumes. On 20 November 1929, the driver and fireman of a northbound goods train were overcome by smoke. The train was moving very slowly in the tunnel due to a heavy load and due to starting from a standstill at . The locomotive, S&DJR; 2-8-0 No. 89, continued on slowly and eventually breasted the summit of the gradient. Its downward course to Bath was accomplished more quickly, and the train ran away, crashing into the goods yard on the approach to Bath Green Park railway station, killing the driver, Henry Jennings, and two railway employees in the yard. The fumes that overcame the footplate crew were a consequence of the restricted bore, lack of ventilation shafts, the exceptional humidity and lack of breeze, and the very slow speed of the train, running tender first. The inspecting officer, Colonel A. C. Trench recommended that maximum loads should be reduced or assistant engines provided to prevent a recurrence.  Two Tunnels Shared Path  This section of the Somerset and Dorset Railway, including the tunnels, is now incorporated into a shared-use walking and cycling path. Planning permission was approved in May 2008 and much of the funding came from a Sustrans Connect2 grant. The fourth and final ¬£100,000 tranche of council funding was made in the 2011/12 financial year; the tunnel was equipped with a cycle-friendly surface and LED lighting. The route was opened on 6 April 2013.

Their original Bryant & May Factory was located in Bow, London. They later opened other match factories in the United Kingdom and Australia, such as the Bryant & May Factory, Melbourne, and owned match factories in other parts of the world. Formed in 1843 by two Quakers, William Bryant and Francis May, Bryant & May survived as an independent company for over seventy years, but went through a series of mergers with other match companies and later with consumer products companies; and were taken over. The registered trade name Bryant & May still exists and it is owned by Swedish Match, as are many of the other registered trade names of the other, formerly independent, companies within the Bryant & May group. Formation Bryant & May 'Pearl' safety matches, 1890‚Äì1891 The match-making company Bryant & May was formed in 1843 by two Quakers, William Bryant and Francis May, to trade in general merchandise. In 1850 the company entered into a relationship with the Swedish match maker Johan Edvard Lundstr√∂m in order to capture part of the market of the 250 million matches that used in Britain each day. Their first order was for 10 or 15 cases of 720,000 matches (each case held 50 gross boxes, with a box holding 100 matches). The next order was for 50 cases; and later orders for 500 cases. This partnership was successful, so Francis May and William Bryant decided to merge the partnership with Bryant's company, Bryant and James, which was based in Plymouth. The company began production after purchasing the rights in Britain for ¬£100. In line with their religious beliefs, Bryant and May decided to produce only safety matches, rather than lucifers. In 1850 the company sold 231,000 boxes; by 1855 this had risen to 10.8 million boxes and to 27.9 million boxes in 1860. Market preference in the UK was for the familiar lucifer match, and by 1880 Bryant & May were also producing them. The same year the company began exporting their goods; in 1884 they became a publicly- listed company. Dividends of 22.5 per cent in 1885 and 20 per cent in 1886 and 1887 were paid. In 1861 Bryant relocated the business to a three-acre site, on Fairfield Road, Bow, East London. The building, an old candle factory, was demolished and a model factory was built in the mock-Venetian style popular at the time. The factory was heavily mechanised and included twenty-five steam engines to power the machinery. On nearby Bow Common, the company built a lumber mill to make splints from imported Canadian pine. Bryant & May were aware of phossy jaw. If a worker complained of having toothache, they were told to have the teeth removed immediately or be sacked. In the 1880s Bryant & May employed nearly 5,000 people, most of them female and Irish, or of Irish descent; by 1895 the figure was 2,000 people of which between 1,200 and 1,500 were women and girls. The workers were paid different rates for completing a ten-hour day, depending on the type of work undertaken. The frame-fillers were paid 1 shilling per 100 frames completed; the cutters received 2 d for three gross of boxes, and the packers got 1s 9d per 100 boxes wrapped up. Those under 14 years-of-age received a weekly wage of about 4 s. Most workers were lucky if they took the full amounts home, as a series of fines were levied by the foremen, with the money deducted directly from wages. The fines included 3 d for having an untidy workbench, talking or having dirty feet‚Äîmany of the workers were bare-footed as shoes were too expensive; 5 d was deducted for being late; and a shilling for having a burnt match on the workbench. The women and girls involved in boxing up the matches, they had to pay the boys who brought them the frames from the drying ovens, and had to supply their own glue and brushes. One girl who dropped a tray of matches was fined 6 d. The match boxes were made through domestic outwork under a sweating system. Such a system was preferred because the workers were not covered under the Factory Acts. Such workers received 2 to 2 d per gross of boxes. The workers had to provide glue and string from their own funds. In 1861, at the Fairfield Works, a dilapidated site that had once been used for the manufacture of candles, crinoline and rope, close to the River Lea in Bow, they began to manufacture their own safety matches and \\"other chemical lights\\". This site was gradually expanded as a model factory. The public were initially unwilling to buy the more expensive safety matches so they also made the more profitable traditional Lucifer Matches. Cartoon from The Day's Doings, showing the police clashing with the match makers' march In 1871 Robert Lowe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, attempted to introduce a tax of d per hundred matches. The Times, in a leader on the proposal, opined that the tax was \\"a singularly reactionary proposal\\" that would affect the poor more heavily. Match-making companies complained about the new levy and arranged a mass-meeting at Victoria Park, London on Sunday 23 April; 3,000 match workers attended, the majority of whom were from Bryant & May. It was resolved to march on the following day to the Houses of Parliament to present a petition. Several thousand match-makers set off from Bow Road in an orderly fashion. The demonstration comprised mostly girls between the ages of thirteen and twenty, and were described in The Times as \\"beyond doubt of the working classes. They ... were accompanied by men and women of their own class, without any admixture of the usual agitators.\\" The marchers were harassed along the way before their progress was blocked by police at Mile End Road. Much of the march progressed through the police line, but parts were split off and made their way via alternative routes to the Westminster, by which time the march numbered approximately 10,000. Clashes ensued, and The Time described that the police had \\"by their hard usage of the matchmakers and spectators, converted what was before not an ill-behaved gathering into a resisting, howling mob\\". The Manchester Guardian described that \\"policemen, strong in their sense of officialism, and bullying in their strength, approached the verge of brutality\\". On the same day as the meeting in Victoria Park, Queen Victoria wrote to the prime minister, William Gladstone, to protest about the tax: > it is difficult not to feel considerable doubt as to the wisdom of the > proposed tax on matches ... [which] will be felt by all classes to whom > matches have become a necessity of life. ... this tax which is intended > should press on all equally will in fact only be severely felt by the poor > which would be very wrong and most impolitic at the present moment. The day following the march, Lowe announced in the House of Commons that the proposed tax was being withdrawn. Bryant and May was involved in three of the most divisive industrial episodes of the 19th century, the sweating of domestic out-workers, the wage \\"fines\\" that led to the London matchgirls strike of 1888 and the scandal of \\"phossy-jaw\\". The strike won important improvements in working conditions and pay for the mostly female workforce working with the dangerous white phosphorus. Mergers with other match makers Bryant & May factory in Bow, which was rebuilt in 1910 To protect its position Bryant & May merged with or took over its rivals. These were: ;Bell and Black In 1885 - factories in Stratford, Manchester, York and Glasgow. ;Diamond Match In 1901 the American match maker the Diamond Match Company bought an existing match factory in the United Kingdom, at Litherland, near Liverpool, and installed a continuous match making machine that could produce 600,000 matches per hour. Their matches were sold under the Captain Webb, Puck and Swan Vesta brand names. Bryant & May could not compete, so in 1905 they bought the assets and goodwill of the British Diamond Match Company; and the (American) Diamond Match Company acquired 54.5 percent of the share capital of Bryant & May. ;S. J. Moreland and Sons In 1913 Bryant & May also took over the Gloucester match maker S.J. Moreland and Sons, who made and sold matches under the trade name England's Glory. ;Swedish Match In 1927 Bryant & May combined with J. John Masters & Co. Ltd (match importers and owners of the Abbey Match Works, Barking, Essex) and the Swedish Match Company's interests in the British Empire (except for major plant in India and elsewhere in Asia) to become the British Match Corporation. ;Albright and Wilson In 1929, the British Match Corporation set up a jointly-owned company with another Quaker company Albright and Wilson: The A & W Match Phosphorus Company. It took over that part of Albright and Wilson's Oldbury site which was manufacturing amorphous phosphorus and phosphorus sesquisulfide, as these two chemicals were used in safety matches and strike-anywhere matches, respectively.Threfall (1951). Merger with Wilkinson Sword In 1973 the British Match Corporation merged with Wilkinson Sword to form the new company Wilkinson Match. Wilkinson Match's shares were acquired by US company Allegheny International from 1978 with Allegheny taking full ownership in 1980. In 1987 Allegheny filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Swedish Match re-acquired the company. In 1990 Swedish Match sold the Wilkinson Sword business, retaining the match business.Competition Commission Reports 1987: Bryant & May and Wilkinson Sword Closure In 1971 the Northern Ireland factory, Maguire & Patterson closed down following a terrorist attack. The original Bow match factory was closed in 1979, when it still employed 275 people; unlike some of the other match factories little recent investment had taken place. The Bow factory site consisted of a number of listed buildings, which have subsequently been converted into the Bow Quarter flats complex.Building, 11 June 1993 In the 1980s, factories in Gloucester and Glasgow closed too leaving Liverpool as the last match factory in the UK. This continued until December 1994.The Times, 23 December 1994. The premises survive today as 'the Matchworks' (grade 2 listed building) and the Matchbox all using the existing buildings with renovations done by Urban Splash. The former Australian match factory, in Melbourne, closed in the mid-1980s. This was converted into offices in 1989.Sunday Age, 3 December 1995. The British match brands continue to survive as brands of Swedish Match and are made outside the UK. Other parts of the merged company involved in shaving products survive, and still use the trade name Wilkinson Sword in Europe, and the Schick trade name elsewhere. However, the shaving products are made in Germany.  Products   Vitafruit  Vitafruit was a confectionery manufactured by the Bryant & May group in 1988.

Holy Spirit Cathedral, Istanbul Turkey is notable for being the only country with territory in Europe, other than Estonia, to have never had a Catholic bishop from its own dominant ethnic group in recent centuries. Demographics In the 2000s, there are around 35,000 Catholics, constituting 0.05% of the population. The faithful follow the Latin, Byzantine, Armenian and Chaldean Rite. Most Latin Rite Catholics are Levantines of mainly Italian or French background, with a few are ethnic Turks, who are usually either converts via marriage to Levantines or other non-Turkish Catholics, or are returnees from Europe who converted there, and who may often be still registered as Muslim by the government. Byzantine, Armenian, and Chaldean rite Catholics are generally members of the Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian minority groups respectively. Turkey's Catholics are concentrated in Istanbul. Persecutions by Muslims The Catholic Christian community was shocked when Father Andrea Santoro, an Italian missionary working in Turkey for 10 years, was shot twice in February 2006 at his church near the Black Sea. He had written a letter to the Pope asking him to visit Turkey. Pope Benedict XVI visited Turkey in November 2006.

It is found sporadically around the world, usually close to the sea floor at depths of . With a sizable oil-filled liver to maintain neutral buoyancy, this shark is able to cruise slowly through the water while expending little energy. The kitefin shark has a slender body with a very short, blunt snout, large eyes, and thick lips. Its teeth are highly differentiated between the upper and lower jaws, with the upper teeth small and narrow and the lower teeth large, triangular, and serrated. Its typical length is . Armed with large teeth and a strong bite, the kitefin shark is a powerful, solitary predator that takes many different types of prey, ranging from bony fishes, sharks and rays, to cephalopods, crustaceans, polychaete worms, siphonophores, and possibly carrion. It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself, similar to its smaller relative, the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 10-14 young. The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat, skin, and liver oil, primarily by Portugal and Japan. A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s, but collapsed due to overfishing and falling liver oil prices; the rapid depletion of the Azores stock is often cited as an example of the susceptibility of deep-sea sharks to human exploitation. The low reproductive rate of this species renders it susceptible to overfishing and, coupled with known population declines, has led it to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy The kitefin shark was originally described as Squalus licha by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre, in his 1788 Tableau encyclop√©dique et m√©thodique des trois regnes de la nature; the type specimen from \\"Le cap Breton\\" has since been lost. This species was later placed in its own genus, Dalatias, which came from the synonymy of Constantine Rafinesque's 1810 Dalatias sparophagus with S. licha. However, some authorities dispute this on the grounds that D. sparophagus is a nomen dubium, and prefer to use the next available genus name Scymnorhinus. The genus name Dalatias is derived from the Greek dalos or dalou, meaning \\"torch\\". The specific epithet licha comes from la liche, the French name for this shark. Additional common names used for the kitefin shark include black shark and darkie Charlie. Phylogeny and evolution Cladistic studies have consistently found that the closest relatives of the kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks (Isistius), with which they share several dentitional, skeletal, and muscular similarities. Dalatias and Isistius are believed to have evolutionarily diverged shortly after the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods (65.5 Ma), as part of a larger adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks from the deep sea into relatively shallower habitats. The oldest fossil teeth that definitively belong to the kitefin shark date to the Middle Eocene epoch, such as those recovered from Bortonian-stage deposits (43.0-37.0 Ma) in New Zealand. Dalatias fossil teeth dating to various ages have also been discovered in Europe, the former USSR, Japan, and western India. The fossil material now recognized as belonging to this species were historically described under a multitude of different names. Description The head of a kitefin shark, showing the large eyes, stubby snout, and thick lips The kitefin shark has a moderately elongated body with a very short, rounded snout. The eyes and spiracles are large. The lips are thick with pleats or fringes, though are not modified to be suctorial. There are 16-21 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 17-20 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small and spike-shaped, curving slightly towards the corners of the mouth. The lower teeth are very large, knife-shaped, and serrated, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface. The first dorsal fin is slightly smaller and shorter-based than the second, and neither has spines. The first dorsal fin originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins, while the second originates above the middle of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short and rounded. The caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well- developed notch near the tip, and a barely present lower lobe. The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), from which this species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines. The dermal denticles are small and flat, with a single horizontal ridge ending in a point. The coloration is a uniform dark brown or gray, sometimes with faint black spots on the back. The fins have white or translucent trailing edges,Dianne J. Bray & William T. White, 2011, Black Shark, Dalatias licha, in Fishes of Australia, accessed 25 Aug 2014, http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/Home/species/2008 and the tip of the caudal fin is black. An long kitefin shark with partial albinism, lacking pigment on 59% of its body, was caught in the Gulf of Genoa in 2003. Unlike in a previous case of an albino Portuguese dogfish, the abnormal coloration of this individual had not diminished its ability to capture prey.Bottaro, M., Ferrando, S., Gallus, L., Girosi, L. and Vacchi, M. (2005). \\"First record of albinism in the deep water shark Dalatias licha\\" Reference No. 5115. JMBA2-Biodiversity Records. Most kitefin sharks are long and weigh ; the maximum reported length is , possibly . Distribution and habitat The kitefin shark has an almost circumglobal range in tropical and warm- temperature waters, consisting of a number of widely separated populations with likely little interchange between them. This shark has not been reported from the eastern Pacific and northern Indian Oceans. In the northern Atlantic, it occurs in the Georges Bank and the northern Gulf of Mexico, and from the North Sea to Cameroon, including around the British Isles, in the western and central Mediterranean Sea, and off Madeira and the Azores. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off South Africa and Mozambique. In the Pacific, it occurs off Japan, Java, Australia and New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands. There is a single record of this species in the southern Atlantic, from off southern Brazil.Finucci, B., Walls, R.H.L., Guallart, J. & Kyne, P.M. 2018. Dalatias licha. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2018: e.T6229A3111662. https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2018-2.RLTS.T6229A3111662.en. Downloaded on 27 December 2018.

Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on June 15, 2009. Off the Azores this shark segregates by sex, with females most common around a depth of and males most common around . The kitefin shark inhabits the outer continental shelves and upper continental slopes, and is also found around oceanic islands and seamounts. It is the only member of its family that tends to be found close to the sea floor as opposed to in the middle of the water column, though on occasion it has been captured well above the bottom. Biology and ecology The lower teeth of the kitefin shark form a continuous cutting edge, enabling it to take bites out of larger animals. Relatively common where it occurs, kitefin sharks are usually solitary in nature but may form small groups. It is a slow swimmer with a large liver filled with squalene, a lipid less dense than water, allowing it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover above the bottom with little effort. Studies off the coast of North Africa and in the Gulf of Genoa have found males outnumbering females by 2:1 and 5:1 respectively; this imbalanced sex ratio has not been observed off South Africa and may reflect sampling bias. The kitefin shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks, as well as by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus).G√≥mez-Villota, F. (2007). Sperm whale diet in New Zealand. Master of Applied Science thesis. Auckland University of Technology. Parasite data on this species is limited; an examination of two sharks caught off Ireland found three nematodes in the stomach lumen. One could be identified as Anisakis simplex L3, while another may have been a larval Raphidascaris. A powerful and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark give it an enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes a wide variety of other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males are more likely to have full stomachs than females for unknown reasons. Reproduction in the kitefin shark is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the uterus and being sustained to term by yolk. Adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteruses; the uterus is not divided into compartments. In the Mediterranean, breeding occurs throughout the year with peaks in spring and fall; females may have a year of rest in between pregnancies. The litter size is 10-16, increasing with female size. The young are born at a length of , varying by geographic location, after a possible gestation period of two years.da Silva, H.M. (1988). \\"Growth and reproduction of kitefin shark, Dalatias licha (Bonn 1788) in Azorean waters.\\" ICES, Demersal Fish Committee CM 1988/G:21. pp. 1-16. The males mature sexually at a length of , and the females at a length of . There is no relationship between an individual's size at birth, size at maturity, and maximum size. Human interactions Japanese researchers measure a kitefin shark; this species has long been of economic significance. The kitefin shark inhabits depths too great for it to be a danger to humans. Its upper teeth have been found lodged in underwater fiberoptic cables. This species has a long history of human exploitation: the meat is consumed in the eastern Atlantic and Japan, and the offal processed into fishmeal. The liver oil is utilized in Portugal, Japan, and South Africa. The skin is made into a type of shagreen useful in the making of furniture and jewelry, and is also favored for the manufacture of \\"boroso\\", a Spanish polished leather. This shark has no commercial value in the western Atlantic. The continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into the deep sea has raised concerns about the vulnerability of this and other deepwater shark species to overfishing, as these sharks have slow growth and reproductive rates. This is exemplified by the rapid stock depletion and collapse of the Azores kitefin shark fishery. This targeted fishery began in the early 1970s for the production of liver oil. In the early 1980s, the fishing fleet was enlarged with the addition of industrial vessels equipped with demersal gillnets, resulting in a fishery peak in 1984 of 937 tons landed. After 1991, kitefin shark catches declined precipitously to under 15 tons annually which, along with a drop in the global price of liver oil, led to the fishery becoming unprofitable by the end of the decade. A population assessment has suggested that the northeastern Atlantic stock had fallen to 50% of the pre-exploitation biomass.ICES. (2007). Report of the Working Group Elasmobranch Fishes (WGEF), 22‚Äì28 June 2007, Galway, Ireland. ICES CM 2007/ACFM:27. pp. 52-55. Fisheries operating off Portugal and Japan are responsible for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and- line.Castro, J.I., Woodley, C.M. and Brudek, R.L. (1999). A preliminary evaluation of the status of shark species. FAO Fisheries Technical Paper No. 380. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In other areas of the northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the kitefin shark as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Vulnerable in light of documented population declines.

The existence of this committee was first revealed in the New Statesman on 12 December 1980. The article, written by Duncan Campbell, asserted that any political group had been subjected to surveillance. Furthermore, the SCOPG had actively sought to undermine, co-opt or coerce eleven groups that were specifically targeted in a confidential report obtained by the paper. What was even more surprising, the SCOPG had been set up to infiltrate pressure groups. The greatest emphasis was placed on a group called the Hong Kong Observers. Due to political pressure the committee ceased to exist in 1983.  Government response  The government officially recognized the existence of the committee but denied that it had any sinister motives. The claim was that it was set up to monitor pressure groups in order to better understand the groups' opinions. Furthermore, the government attacked the New Statesman for inaccuracies and lies (such as the allegation that the committee had sought to infiltrate pressure groups). The report had also put pressure on the government to reveal details about the Special Branch, which Campbell had put at 20% of the police force. The government rejected these figures and also asserted that the staff of 1,200 was used to accommodate state visits, avert terrorist acts, and subversive activities by Kuomintang agents.  Later revelations  The Hong Kong Standard revealed on 16 January 1981 that there were personal attacks as well as plans for possible infiltration of groups such as school and college associations. The paper reported that the goal of the SCOPG was to protect Hong Kong's image abroad. On 28 January 1981 the same paper reported on a 'Red List' after it had obtained 11 further confidential reports. The three groups that were supposedly threatened by Communist infiltration were the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union (HKPTU)(headed by Szeto Wah), the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) and the Government School Non-Graduate Teachers Union (GSNTU). In response to this revelation, the government said that this report did not reflect the official opinion of the government.

The Apostolic Nuncio to Trinidad and Tobago is, since December 2011, Archbishop Nicola Girasoli, who is also Apostolic Nuncio to other independent states and Apostolic Delegate for the dependent territories in the Caribbean area. History The Catholic Church has been present on the island of Trinidad since the 15th century, when the first missionaries arrived here from the Dominican and the Franciscan Religious orders. Missionary ventures to the country launched in the 16th century resulted in the death of a number of missionaries. In 1516, Trinidad was named a territorial abbey, which was the first Catholic structure in Trinidad and Tobago. This Territorial abbey ceased to exist in 1650. The first Catholic church in Trinidad was built in 1591. Capuchins worked there from 1618 to 1803. In 1672, Trinidad and adjacent islands were included in the Diocese of Puerto Rico and in 1790 in the Diocese of Santo Tom√°s de Guayana, now Archdiocese of Ciudad Bolivar. In 1797, Trinidad came under British control and missionary work continued because freedom of worship was granted to Catholics. In 1818, the Apostolic Vicariate of Trinidad was established, and on 30 April 1850 it was elevated to the Archdiocese of Port of Spain in 1850. Constant missionary activity of the Catholic Church only began in 1864 in Trinidad. Only in 1864 did the archbishops begin a serious program of evangelization of the island of Tobago, where other Christian denominations had prospered in the meantime, including Anglicans and Methodists. In the history of the local Tobago Catholic community, Catherine Creigh goes down in history as the first Catholic, baptized on March 5, 1870. Demography and structure Trinidad and Tobago is made up of two main islands and 21 smaller islands, has an area of 5128 km¬≤ and a census population of 1,223,916 inhabitants (2011). There are just under 264,365 Catholics in the country, representing 21.6% percent of the total population, according to 2011 census. This is the largest Catholic community in the English-speaking Caribbean. The entire nation is administered as the Archdiocese of Port of Spain, which is divided into five episcopal vicariates. The country has 61 parishes. In Port-of-Spain there is the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which is a small basilica. The archbishop of Port of Spain is a member of the Antilles Episcopal Conference. Nuncio On July 23, 1978 Pope Paul VI issued a breve \\"Commune omnium bonum\\", which established in Trinidad and Tobago an Apostolic Nunciature.

In closing decades, in widely upheld form, it amounted to proving a reasonable total loss of control as a response to another's objectively provocative conduct sufficient to convert what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter. It does not apply to any other offence. It was abolished on 4 October 2010The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2010 (S.I. 2010/816 (C. 56)), article 6(b); and see here by section 56(1) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, but thereby replaced by the superseding‚Äîand more precisely worded‚Äîloss of control. The principles Under section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957 (repealed, see below): The initial burden was on the defence to raise sufficient evidence of provocation. As a matter of law, the judge would then decide whether to leave the defence to the jury. This did not change the burden of proof which, as in all criminal cases, was on the prosecution to prove the actus reus and mens rea of the offence charged, i.e. murder. The Act changed the common law, under which provocation had to fall under one of the following expectations: *a grossly insulting assault *witnessing an attack on a relative *Using fighting words that would normally provoke a fight *Using hate crimes on an individual *witnessing an Englishman being unlawfully deprived of his liberty *a husband discovering his wife in the act of adultery; and *a father discovering someone committing sodomy on his son.Per Holmes v DPP (1946) AC 588) The Act provided that provocation could be by anything done or said without it having to be an illegal act and the provoker and the deceased could be a third parties.See Davies (1975) QB 691 If the accused was provoked, who provoked him was irrelevant. This section of the Act was repealed on 4 October 2010.The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2010 (S.I. 2010/816 (C. 56)), article 5(g)(i) It was superseded by sections 54 to 56 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 when they came into force on the same date. The factual limb This was a subjective test and a pure question of fact, i.e. the evidence had to show that the defendant actually lost his self-control. In R v Duffy,R v Duffy (1949) 1 AER 932 Devlin J. said that Under normal circumstances, the response to the provocation had to be almost immediate retaliation. If there was a \\"cooling-off\\" period, the court would find that the accused should have regained control, making all subsequent actions intentional and therefore murder. In R v Ibrams & GregoryR v Ibrams & Gregory (1982) 74 Cr. App. R. 154 the defendants had been terrorised and bullied by the deceased over a period of time so devised a plan to attack him. There was no evidence of a sudden and temporary loss of self-control as required by Duffy. Even the period of time to fetch a weapon could be sufficient to cool off. In R v Thornton,R v Thornton (1992) 1 AER 306 a woman suffering from \\"battered woman syndrome\\" went to the kitchen, took and sharpened a carving knife, and returned to stab her husband. The appeal referred to s3 which required the jury to have regard to \\"everything both said and done according to the effect which in their opinion it would have on a reasonable man\\". The appellant argued that instead of considering the final provocation, the jury should have considered the events over the years leading up to the killing. Beldam L. J. rejected this, saying: But in R v Thornton (No 2)R v Thornton (No 2) (1996) 2 AER 1023 after considering new medical evidence, a retrial was ordered and the defendant was convicted of manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility. Similarly, in R v AhluwaliaR v Ahluwalia (1992) 4 AER 889 a retrial was ordered. The defendant had poured petrol over her husband and set it alight, causing burns from which he died. When the defence of diminished responsibility on the ground of \\"battered woman syndrome\\" was put, she was convicted of manslaughter. In R v Humphreys,R v Humphreys (1995) 4 AER 1008 the defendant finally lost self-control after years of abuse and stabbed her partner. She pleaded that the final words had been the straw that broke the camel's back. The conviction for murder was held unsafe because the accused's psychiatric condition stemming from the abuse should have been attributed to the reasonable person when the jury considered the application of the objective test. The reasonable person test If the jury was satisfied that the defendant was provoked, the test was whether a reasonable person would have acted as the defendant did - an objective test. It was held in CamplinDPP v Camplin (1978) AC 705 (HL) that the accused's age and sex could be attributed to the reasonable man when the jury considered the defendant's power of self-control. Further, that any characteristic of the accused could be included which the jury considered may affect the gravity of the provocation. Therefore, the reasonable person had to be endowed with the particular characteristics of the accused. In a number of leading cases, MorhallR v Morhall (1995) 3 AER 659 (HL) and Luc Thiet Thuan v R,Luc Thiet Thuan v R (1997) AC 131 (PC) it was held that the judge should direct the jury to consider whether an ordinary person with ordinary powers of self-control would have reacted to the provocation as the defendant did and that no allowance should be given for any characteristics that might have made him or her more volatile than the ordinary person. These decisions acknowledged, however, that, in addition to age and sex, characteristics which affected the gravity of the provocation to the defendant should be taken into account. In R v SmithR v Smith (2000) 4 AER 289 the defendant was charged with murder and relied on the defence of provocation, alleging that he had been suffering from serious clinical depression and had been so provoked by the deceased as to lose his self-control. Lord Hoffman held that the test was whether the jury thought that the circumstances were such as to make the loss of self-control sufficiently excusable to reduce the gravity of the offence from murder to manslaughter. Furthermore, the House held, by a majority, that no distinction should be drawn, when attributing characteristics for the purposes of the objective part of the test imposed by s3 Homicide Act, between their relevance to the gravity of the provocation to a reasonable man and his reaction to it. Account could be taken of a relevant characteristic in relation to the accused's power of self-control, whether or not the characteristic was the object of the provocation. But in HM's AG for Jersey v HolleyHM's AG for Jersey v Holley (2005) 3 AER 371 the Privy Council regarded Smith as wrongly decided, interpreting the Act as setting a purely objective standard. Thus, although the accused's characteristics were to be taken into account when assessing the gravity of the provocation, the standard of self-control to be expected was invariable except for the accused's age and sex. The defendant and the deceased both suffered from chronic alcoholism and had a violent and abusive relationship. The evidence was that the deceased was drunk and taunted him by telling him that she had had sex with another man. The defendant then struck the deceased with an axe which was an accident of availability. Psychiatric evidence was that his consumption of alcohol was involuntary and that he suffered from a number of other psychiatric conditions which, independently of the effects of the alcohol, might have caused the loss of self-control and induced him to kill. Lord Nicholls said: In R v Faqir MohammedR v Faqir Mohammed (2005) EWCA Crim 1880 a cultured Asian man caught a young man leaving his daughter's bedroom window. He immediately killed his daughter by repeatedly stabbing her with a knife. Following the death of his wife five years earlier he suffered from depression, and there was credible evidence that he had a violent temperament and had repeatedly been violent towards his daughters and his wife. Despite the fact that a Privy Council ratio decidendi is only persuasive authority, the Court of Appeal applied it and reinstated the law before Smith. Scott Baker L. J. said: In R v JamesR v James (2006) EWCA Crim 14 the court again considered the relationship between the Privy Council decision in Holley and Smith. In his commentary on Holley, Ashworth (2005) said: Viewing this situation as exceptional, Phillips CJ. accepted that the Privy Council decision had indeed overruled the House of Lords, recognising the error that the Lords had made in their earlier interpretation of the law. Rather than follow the strict rules of precedent and send the issue back to the Lords for clarification, the Court of Appeal accepted the de facto situation and recognised Holley as the binding precedent. Self-induced provocation The Privy Council held in Edwards v REdwards v R (1973) AC 648 that a blackmailer could not rely on the predictable results of his demands for money when his victim attacked him (a policy decision to prevent a criminal from relying on his own wrongdoing as the cause of the subsequent death). In R v Johnson,R v Johnson (1989) 2 AER 839 the defendant had become involved in an escalating argument with the deceased and his female companion. When the victim threatened the defendant with a beer glass, the defendant fatally stabbed him with a knife. The judge instructed the jury that they were open to find the threatening situation had been self-induced, in which case provocation would not be open as a defence. The Court of Appeal held that section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957 provided that anything could amount to provocation, responsive actions provoked by the defendant. It applied the defence (duly substituting the conviction for that of manslaughter). Sentencing The Sentencing Council set out a guideline for manslaughter (substituted for charge/finding of murder) by reason of an accepted defence of loss of control. It came in to effect on 1 November 2018.https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/offences/crown- court/item/manslaughter-by-reason-of-loss-of-control/ *The recommended \\"offence range\\" is 3 - 20 years custody. *The maximum is life imprisonment. *This is a serious specified offence for the purposes of sections 224 and 225(2) (life sentences for serious offences) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. *This is an offence listed in Part 1 of Schedule 15B for the purposes of section 224A (life sentence for a second listed offence) and section 226A (extended sentence for certain violent, sexual or terrorism offences) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. *The type of manslaughter (and thereby the appropriate guideline) should have been identified prior to sentence. A nine- stage formula is to be used, for ideal legal compliance. Stage 1, culpability, will set the sentencing \\"starting point\\". Notably the fourth stage is reduction for guilty pleas (such as by a plea bargain); the fifth is dangerousness. If the actions and/or psychological reports are adverse they may well meet the criteria in Chapter 5 of Part 12 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 by which it would be appropriate to impose a life sentence (section 224A or section 225) or an extended sentence (section 226A).

He is best known for his character Thrud the Barbarian, which originally appeared in White Dwarf magazine, and for his work for the Lobster Random comics. Career Critchlow's comic book career began in the early 1980s, when he contributed to fanzines and informal publications. His professional career began in 1983 when his work was published in Issue 45 of Games Workshop's White Dwarf magazine, where Critchlow first portrayed his fantasy barbarian character, Thrud the Barbarian, in a regular, page-long, black and white, ink- drawn strip of the same name. Thrud was published for over fours years until issue 106; the strip was voted 'most popular feature' for three years running in readers' polls. Thrud the Barbarian often reflected current Games Workshop product lines and borrowed themes from games like Judge Dredd, Blood Bowl and Warhammer 40,000 and Thrud's native fantasy theme. To celebrate the character's status as a popular feature of the publication, Citadel produced a number of metal miniatures of Thrud. Shannon Appelcline referred to Bil's \\"Gobbledigook\\" and \\"Thrud the Barbarian\\" as the two comics \\"for which White Dwarf is probably best known\\". Critchlow also provided numerous black and white interior illustrations for Games Workshop's Dark Future game, and was featured in an Illuminations expos√® in White Dwarf issue 103. In 1984, Critchlow had his debut in mainstream comic books when he contributed The Black Currant strip for Warrior issue 26. In the 1990s, after the Thrud strip had concluded in White Dwarf, Critchlow began working with 2000AD, and he contributed artwork for Pat Mills' Nemesis & Deadlock strip. Critchlow contributed art for numerous strips in 2000AD, including Tharg's Future Shocks, Judge Dredd, Mean Machine: Son of Mean Machine, Tales of Telguuth, Flesh, and full colour work for the 1995 crossover Judge Dredd/Batman:The Ultimate Riddle.Szadkowski, Joseph (30 October 2004). \\"Dreaded Judge, Batman confront maniacal evil\\", The Washington Times, p. C12. Critchlow further contributed to the gaming world in 2000, and his work appeared in Dungeons & Dragons third edition books Monster Manual, Monsters of Faer√ªn, Magic of Faer√ªn, Lords of Darkness, Tome of Magic and Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss. He has also provided illustrations for the Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game and the Star Wars supplements Secrets of Tatooine, Ultimate Alien Anthology and Star Wars Hero's Guide and almost two hundred illustrations for the Magic: The Gathering card game. He also contributed to JLA: Riddle of the Beast, a DC Comics graphic novel by Alan Grant.Solomon, Rizal (26 February 2003). \\"Parallel lives\\", The Malay Mail, p. 30. In 2000, Critchlow withdrew from mainstream comics; he wrote and drew the Thrud the Barbarian strip for its own comic. The series proved popular with the comic reading public and won the Diamond 2004 Award for Best Small Press title. During this time he also worked as a lecturer and numerous new comics artists, such as Barry Renshaw, credited him for helping and inspiring them. In October 2002, four months after the first issue of Thrud was published, Critchlow started drawing for 2000AD again. His first work was the Judge Dredd story Out of the Undercity written by John Wagner, followed by the introduction of new comic Lobster Random in 2003 with No Gain, No Pain, written by Simon Spurrier. This was followed by Tooth & Claw in 2004 and The Agony & the Ecstasy in 2006. His current work includes ongoing artwork for Lobster Random and artwork for Judge Dredd scripts by Gordon Rennie. Style and reception Critchlow's early work, including the entire Thrud the Barbarian series in White Dwarf, consisted entirely of black and white ink drawings. The Thrud character originated at art college, where Critchlow was studying under comic artist Bryan Talbot.Critchlow was presented with a comic strip project for the course, and began to develop Thrud. Critchlow was inspired by Robert E. Howard's Conan stories, which he was reading at the time. In an expos√® published in White Dwarf towards the end of Thrud's tenure, art editor John Blanche wrote that Critchlow's \\"unique, chunky comic book technique provides the perfect vehicle for the biffoesque barbarian.\\" In the 1990s Critchlow began to use colour; his work on the 1995 Batman/Judge Dredd: The Ultimate Riddle was fully painted. At the time, while considered impressive his painting work was also considered forced, confused and muddy. Critic Joseph Szadkowski wrote that Critchlow's 1996 work \\"Sherlock Joker Strikes Out\\" shows his \\"commitment to presenting the Joker in an expressionist style, almost [Ernst Ludwig] Kirchner in a good mood.\\"Szadkowski, Joseph (24 February 1996). \\"Tour of treasures in tiny museum\\", The Washington Times, p. B4. Critchlow continued to develop his colour work and new stylistic direction as he abandoned paint and began to combine traditional line drawings with computer colouring. However, having been pigeon-holed as a painter he did not believe he could interest anyone in this radically different approach. This new combination of techniques was used in 2000AD for the Judge Dredd story Out of the Undercity and was initially well received and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style, with clearer figures and atmospheric computer colouring. As the Undercity story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using too narrow a palette, with too many greys and blues, although this may have been a result of the story's underground setting. By the end of the series, views on Critchlow's artwork were mixed, although some readers wanted to see him working on a story set above ground and in daylight. Criticism of Critchlow's subdued colouring style continued with his work on the Lobster Random debut in 2003, but as appreciation for the story grew, the two-toned colouring and scratchy line style were viewed by some as well-suited to the character. In one instalment, in which the protagonist is drugged, Critchlow introduced more colour into the strip, used sumptuous Day-Glo colours and experimented with unconventional panel layouts, moves that were well received. By the conclusion, Critchlow's style was recognised as unique, and even the previously criticised blues and greys were viewed as working well with other coloured elements. In 2004, Critchlow's work on the Judge Dredd story, Cincinnati was praised for showing further stylistic improvements and introducing more colour than had previously been used. Critchlow's work on two further Lobster Random stories in 2004 and 2006 was very well received. Tooth & Claw was praised for its character designs and use of colour, and The Agony & the Ecstasy was considered immediately recognisable with its \\"volume, colour and verve\\". Critchlow named Frank Frazetta as his principle formative influences, and he was inspired by seeing the work of Bryan Talbot's Luthor Arkwright series first hand. His other favourite artists from the comic book genre include Mike McMahon, Mike Mignola, Duncan Fegredo, Jamie Hewlett, Simon Davis, Nicolas de Crecy and Masamune Shirow.

Early Life Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ªëc was born in the Vi·ªát Y√™n District of the province of B·∫Øc Giang in French Indochina, north of Hanoi. When he was 5 years old, his father, Nguyen Van Bay (Chairman of the Viet Minh in the district) and his uncle (also a member of the Viet Minh), were killed by the French. Fearing further trouble with the French, his mother moved the family. Nguy·ªÖn spent the rest of his childhood near Chu air base, which kindled an interest in aircraft. Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ªëc attended Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n school in B·∫Øc GiangDavies, page 48. and upon completion of his schooling, enlisted in the Quan Chung Khong Quan (Vietnamese People's Air Force, VPAF) in 1961 and underwent his initial training at Cat Bi Airbase in Haiphong. Nguy·ªÖn subsequently spent four years undergoing pilot training in the Soviet Union at the Bataysk and Krasnodar Soviet Air Force bases. Of the 120 trainees dispatched in Nguy·ªÖn's draft to the Soviet Union, he was one of seven who graduated as a MiG-17 pilot. After a brief spell back in North Vietnam serving with the 921st Sao Do (Red Star) Fighter Regiment, he returned to the Soviet Union and underwent conversion training to the MiG-21 in a two-seat Mig-21U, before returning to the 921st Fighter Regiment in June 1965. He began operational flying in December 1965. On 2 January 1967,VPAF Ejections during the SEA conflict to the present in chronological order, Retrieved 2 December 2009. he was among a group of pilots who fell into a trap set by the United States Air Forces 8th Tactical Fighter Wing. Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ªëc and four other Vietnamese pilots were shot down. All ejected safely. Flying a MIG-21PF, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ªëc normally served as a wingman. He scored all his victories using the heat-seeking R-3S Atoll missile. In 1969, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ªëc was awarded a Huy Hi·ªáu medal for each of his nine claimed kills. The end of Operation Rolling Thunder on 31 October 1968 removed him from the opportunity for further air combat. In that year, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ªëc was transferred from operational duties so that his valuable combat experience could be put to use in training new pilots. Among the pilots he trained was Nguyen Duc Soat. After the war, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ªëc remained with the Vietnamese People's Air Force, retiring with the rank of Chief Inspector in 2002 after declining health. Air combat victories Nine air-to-air combat kills of United States aircraft and two AQM-34 Firebee UAV kills were credited to him during the Vietnam War. Of these, seven have currently been acknowledged by the United States Air Force. While sometimes U.S. forces may have attributed aircraft losses to surface-to-air missiles, since it was considered \\"less embarrassing\\",Gordon, Yefim \\"MiG-21\\" there was often doubt about cause of the loss.

The flights were led by Dang Ngoc Ngu, Nguyen Van Minh and Nguyen Van Coc.Toperczer, p. 20 Due to the lack of coordination between the different sections of the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment and the ground-based air-defense forces, the MiG-21 flights were mistakenly identified as U.S. fighter-bombers and were fired upon by North Vietnamese anti-aircraft artillery.Toperczer, p. 21 Moments later, Ngu also mistook an escorting flight of MiG-21 fighters flown by Nguyen Dang Kinh and Nguyen Van Lung for U.S. fighters. He dropped his fuel tanks to prepare for an attack which was promptly aborted when he realized they were North Vietnamese. : Later, Ngu and Coc arrived over the skies of Do Luong, north-east of Vinh, and they made three circuits over the area when they were told that enemy aircraft were detected coming from the sea; these were real U.S. fighters. The U.S. flight detected were a formation of five F-4B Phantom II from Fighter Squadron 92 (VF-92), , led by Lieutenant Commander Ejnar S.

In the ensuing dogfight, two AIM-7 missiles were fired by the U.S. Navy fighters but missed. Ngu then noticed two F-4B Phantoms about to starboard, but could not get into a suitable firing position. Coc was right behind Ngu at the time, but he wanted to disengage from the fight as his aircraft was running low on fuel.

In 2009, the size of the community was estimated at 300 people. History In modern times the Catholic Church obtained a presence in Tajikistan through Soviet deportations, and in 1974, churches were opened in Dushanbe (St Joseph Church, Dushanbe) and Qurghonteppa. Most of the early Catholics were Germans of Russian, Ukrainian and Lithuanian origin. Many Catholics fled the 1990s civil war following the Soviet Union collapse. In 1997, Pope John Paul II created a mission sui iuris for the country to be administered by the Institute of the Incarnate Word of Argentina. The Institute sent priests from South America to Tajikistan. In 2003, the Church opened a center and soup kitchen in Dushanbe for homeless children. By 2004, the mission had three parishes, one mission center, five priests, four nuns of the Missionaries of Charity, and its own website. In 2005, three sisters of the Servants of the Lord and Our Lady of Matara came to live in Tajikistan. The Missionaries of Charity started sewing classes for young women in 2006 so they might develop skills and further their education. In July 2007, Father Avila joined with the 22 non-Islamic religious groups in the country to object to a bill that would greatly restrict the activities of religious minorities. In March 2008, many poor and elderly citizens queued at the nuns house in Dushanbe to receive aid from Caritas Tajikistan, Care International and United States Catholic Relief Service to survive the harsh winter. In 2012, there were three Tajiks studying for the priesthood and three who wish to be nuns.

In English law, diminished responsibility is one of the partial defences that reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter if successful (termed \\"voluntary\\" manslaughter for these purposes). This allows the judge sentencing discretion, e.g. to impose a hospital order under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to ensure treatment rather than punishment in appropriate cases. Thus, when the actus reus (Latin for \\"guilty act\\") of death is accompanied by an objective or constructive version of mens rea (Latin for \\"guilty mind\\"), the subjective evidence that the defendant did intend to kill or cause grievous bodily harm because of a mental incapacity will partially excuse his conduct. Under s.2(2) of the Homicide Act 1957 the burden of proof is on the defendant to the balance of probabilities. The M'Naghten Rules lack a volitional limb of \\"irresistible impulse\\"; diminished responsibility is the volitional mental condition defence in English criminal law. The statutory provision Section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 states: (1) Where a person kills or is party to a killing of another, he shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which - *(a) arose from a medical condition *(b) substantially impaired D's ability to do one or more of the things mentioned in subsection (1A), and *(c) provides an explanation for D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing. (1A) Those things are - *(a) to understand the nature of D's conduct; *(b) to form a rational judgment; *(c) to exercise self-control. (1B) For the purposes of subsection (1)(c), an abnormality of mental functioning provides and explanation of D's conduct if it causes, or is a significant contributory factor in causing, D to carry out that conduct. The defence has recently been amended by s. 52 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which came into force on 4 October 2010. How substantial must the impairment be? R v GoldsR v Golds[2014] EWCA Crim 748 provides a recent authority from the Court of Appeal Criminal Division on how the courts will interpret the term 'substantial'. At paragraph [55] of Elias LJ's judgment (following the paragraphing from the neutral citation given below) two senses of the word 'substantial' are identified: (i) something substantial is more than something which is merely trivial or minimal owing to the fact that it has \\"substance\\", or (ii) something substantial is big or large (e.g. in the sense that a substantial salary is a large one). At paragraph [72] Elias LJ concludes by opining that the court should (i) leave interpretation of the word 'substantial' to the jury, but if asked for further help should (ii) direct them under the second meaning of the term (i.e. substantial meaning big). Diminished responsibility and voluntary intoxication Voluntary intoxication will not satisfy the criterion that there must be an abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition (s.2(1)(a) Homicide Act 1957) and therefore cannot be relied upon as grounds for the partial defence.R v Fenton (1975) 61 Cr App Rep 261 However a person suffering from alcoholism that has led to an abnormality of mental function may have access to the partial defence.R v Tandy [1989] 1 WLR 350 In R v GittensR v Gittens (1984) QB 698 a defendant who suffered from depression killed his wife and stepdaughter after drinking and taking drugs for medication. The direction to a jury facing both diminished responsibility and drunkenness should be: *Would the defendant have killed as he did if he had not been drunk? and if the answer to that is yes, *Was he suffering from diminished responsibility when he did so? The more chronic forms of alcoholism and the long-term use of heroin and cocaine (see R v SandersonR v Sanderson (1994) 98 Cr. App. R. 325) can become a relevant factor where a craving for drink or drugs causes an abnormality of mind. This must be distinguished from the situation in which the abnormality of mind causes a craving for drink or drugs . R v TandyR v Tandy (1989) 1 AER 267 held that where a defendant could show that she was suffering from an abnormality of the mind, that it was induced by disease (namely alcoholism), and that it substantially impaired her responsibility for her actions, then the defence of diminished responsibility would be made out. In the actual case, the craving for alcohol did not render the use of alcohol involuntary. The defendant was in control when she began drinking, and the state of mind in which she killed her daughter was merely induced by the alcohol. In R v Dietschmann,R v Dietschmann the House of Lords held that where a defendant suffers from an abnormality of mind within s2(1) also consumes alcohol before the killing, the jury should find him or her guilty of manslaughter if they are satisfied that, notwithstanding the alcohol consumed and its effect, the abnormality of mind substantially impaired the mental responsibility for the fatal acts. The sub- section does not require the abnormality of mind to be the sole cause of the defendant‚Äôs acts; even if the defendant would not have killed if he had not consumed alcohol, the causative effect of the alcohol does not prevent an abnormality of mind suffered by the defendant from substantially impairing his mental responsibility for the fatal acts. Dietschmann was later applied by the Court of Appeal in R v Hendy.R v Hendy References *Boland, F.

The empathic design process is sometimes mistakenly referred to as empathetic design.Landwher, P., \\"Empathic Design vs. Empathetic Design: A History of Confusion\\", Nov 2007, http://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/dialectics/designmethods/plandweh.pdf  Characteristics  The foundation of empathic design is observation and the goal to identify latent customer needs in order to create products that the customers don't even know they desire, or, in some cases, solutions that customers have difficulty envisioning due to lack of familiarity with the possibilities offered by new technologies or because they are locked in a specific mindset. Empathic design relies on observation of consumers as opposed to traditional market researchMattelm√§ki, T. and Battarbee, K., \\"Empathy Probes\\", The Proceedings of PDC2002, Malmo 23-25.6.2002 which relies on consumer inquiry with the intention to avoid possible biases in surveys and questions, and minimizes the chance that consumers will provide false information. Observations are carried out by a small team of specialists, such as an engineer, a human-factors expert, and a designer. Each specialist then documents their observations and the session is videoed to capture subtle interactions such as body language and facial expressions. Learning users' unarticulated needs through a process of keen observation and interpretation can lead to breakthrough designs. Deszca et al. argue that market forces and competitive pressures in a fast-paced world are augmenting the importance of product innovation as a source of competitive advantage. They argue that in empathic design techniques, users are almost as involved in product design as designers and engineers. Therefore, such technique can achieve new designs in potentially shorter product development cycles. To achieve this, they caution that observation group should consist of several others than simply designers and engineers, including trained anthropologists and/or ethnographers.Deszca, G., Munro, H., and Noori, H., \\"Developing Breakthrough Products: Challenges and Options for Market Assessment\\", Journal of Operations Management, Vol 17, 1999, pp613-630 Von Hippel's research supports the theory that customers or users themselves are the source of much innovation. Empathic design using field observation can reveal opportunities to commercialize innovations existing users have already developed to improve products.von Hippel, E., Thomke, S., and Sonnack, M., \\"Creating Breakthroughs at 3M\\", Harvard Business Review, 77(5), 1999, pp47-57  Process  Leonard and Rayport identify the five key steps in empathic design as:Leonard, D. and Rayport, J.F., \\"Spark Innovation Through Empathic Design\\", Harvard Business Review, Nov-Dec 1997 # Observation # Capturing Data # Reflection and Analysis # Brainstorming for solutions # Developing prototypes of possible solutions Prototypes, simulation and role-playing are other forms of learning processes, typically used to gather customer feedback to designs that have been developed based on empathic design. One of the practitioners of empathic design is design company IDEO. IDEO believes that \\"seeing and hearing things with your own eyes and ears is a critical first step in creating a breakthrough product\\" IDEO refers to this as \\"human factors\\" or \\"human inspiration\\" and states that \\"Innovation starts with an eye\\", and once they start observing carefully, all kinds of insights and opportunities can pop up. IDEO include empathic design in their projects and list the key steps to their method as:Kelley, T. and Littman, J., \\"The Art of Innovation\\", New York: Currency Books, 2001, ISBN * Understand the market, client, technology and perceived constraints. * Observe people in real-life situations to find out what motivates them, what confuses them, what they like, hate, where they have latent needs not addressed by current products and services. * Visualize concepts that are new to the world * Evaluate and refine the prototype * Implement the new concept for commercialization. The empathic model is a technique used to simulate age-related sensory losses to give designers personal experience with how their product performs for users. An example is how designers of a retirement community used empathy tools, such as glasses which reduced their vision and gloves which limited their grip and strength. Suri et al. reported another method of empathic design, involving designers shadowing vision-impaired users. The designer was then required to utilize non-visual cues to learn about a product by working in a dark environment.Suri, J.F., Battarbee, K., and Koskinen, I., \\"Designing in the Dark ‚Äì Empathic Exercises to inspire design for our non-visual senses\\", http://www2.uiah.fi/~ikoskine/idmi05/designinginthedark.pdf Since its introduction, empathic design techniques for new products were first adopted by automotive and electronic product manufacturing industry. However, the techniques have been successfully used by several other organizations for designing innovative products. While the five abovementioned steps are at the foundation of empathic design process, several other techniques are used in combination with these five steps. A study performed on UK based textile fiber manufacturer, Tencel Limited, by Lofthouse et al., shows that use of the Kano model in combination with the first step of user observation has led to understanding of new insights into how customers really perceived Tencel's fiber, and enabled the product development team to 'walk in the shoes' of the end user. The Kano model offered some insight into which product attributes were perceived to be important to customers. The questionnaires used to seek information from users, an important part of Kano model, were used in multiple focus groups consisting of target customers and multidisciplinary design teams. These focus groups carried the process into next three steps of capturing data, reflection and analysis, and brainstorming. In doing so they developed a so-called \\"journey diagram\\" to record activities that these groups identified to be necessary to move the project towards its final target.Lofthouse, V., Bhamra, T., and Burrow, T., \\"A new way of understanding the customer, for fibre manufacturers\\" J√§√§sko and Mattelm√§ki have studied user-centered design techniques such as empathic design by means of case studies in which they found extensive use of empathic design techniques when developing innovative patient monitoring instruments in hospitals by Datex- Ohmeda division of Instrumentarium Corporation. Datex-Ohmeda used a new technique called \\"probing\\" in combination with observation for gathering instrumental, visual and empathic data from \\"sensitive settings\\" ‚Äì that is, situations and places where design team had no access or the access was only temporary. The probing process consisted of diaries, cameras, and illustrated cards with open questions and tasks for documenting routines, actions, and needs in different use situations.J√§√§sko, V. and Mattelm√§ki, T., \\"Observing and Probing\\", ACM, DPPI'03, Jun 2003, pp126-131 Brandt and Grunnet have studied the use of drama and props as tools in empathic design process to collaboratively generate and explore innovative design ideas. They argue that use of drama and props may aid in engaging users more directly in the design process, especially during the prototype simulation step.Brandt, E. and Grunnet, C., \\"Evoking the Future: Drama and Props in User-centered Design\\", PDC 2000  Examples in practice  The following examples demonstrate cases where empathic design was applied to the new product development process successfully. * Design Continuum of Milan, Italy, designed a series of baby bottles by using empathic design techniques where a team of designers collected data on user needs by observing kids in kindergartens and immersing themselves in the homes of some first time mothers. * The Instrumentarian Corporation‚Äôs Datex-Ohmeda division used empathic design (including the use of user diaries, cameras, and short-term observation in critical situations) to assist in the improvement of products provided to nurses in the health care industry. * Polar Electro Oy, a manufacturer of heart rate monitors, used empathic design principles to observe and record user interactions with their product. The resulting data was fed back into the design organization to influence future designs and product development. * Tencel LTD, a textile manufacturer in the United Kingdom, used empathic design techniques to solicit feedback on their current product line, understand positive and negative traits, and determine areas for immediate improvement. * IDEO, Inc., a broad- based design services company, is well known for its employment of empathic design and brainstorming as its principal design methodology. Most products designed by IDEO incorporate some features based on the results of an empathic design experience.

Life and career By day Gallet supported himself by a minor post in the Administration of Assistance to the Poor and positions, first as treasurer then as general administrator, at the Beaujon hospital, Paris, and other hospitals (ref. Saint-Sa√´ns). In 1871 Camille du Locle, the manager of the Paris Op√©ra-Comique, offered to produce a one-act work of Camille Saint- Sa√´ns. He proposed as collaborator Louis Gallet, whom Saint-Sa√´ns did not know, and the result was the slight piece La princesse jaune; it was notable as the first japonerie on the operatic stage, Japan having only very recently been opened to Western trade and the first Japanese woodblock prints having been seen in Paris only two years previously. The two worked together harmoniously for years, and it was Saint-Sa√´ns who recommended Gallet as music critic for the Nouvelle Revue, though he was not a musician. For Massenet he first provided a libretto for the oratorio Marie-Magdeleine (1872) which proved to be Massenet's first major success and the first of his four dramatic oratorios. Georges Bizet's one-act opera Djamileh to Gallet's libretto premiered successfully, 22 May 1872 at the Op√©ra-Comique, Paris), but two other Bizet operas by Gallet and Edouard Blau remained incomplete at Bizet's untimely death in 1875: La coupe du roi de Thul√© (1869) and a five-act Don Rodrigue (1873). In his libretto for Massenet's Tha√Øs he employed an unrhymed free verse that he termed, in Parnassien fashion, po√©sie melique which, like its classical Greek predecessors, was designed for a declamation with accompaniment (melodrama). In Gallet's hands declamation rose by degrees into a freely-structured aria that was raised above the level of prose by its sonorities and syntactical patterns, formulas that were finely suited to the musical techniques of both Saint-Sa√´ns and Massenet. After Gallet's death, Saint-Sa√´ns wrote: > I wish I knew what to say about the man himself, his unwearying goodness, > his loyalty, his scrupulousness, his good humor, his originality, his > continual common sense, and his intellect, alert to everything unusual and > interesting.

It has been awarded annually since 1947 for the best work of prose fiction written in the Italian language by an author of any nationality and first published between 1 May of the previous year and 30 April. History In 1944 Maria and Goffredo Bellonci started to host a literary salon at their home in Rome. These Sunday gatherings of writers, artists and intellectuals grew to include many of the most notable figures of Italian cultural life. The group became known as the Amici della Domenica, or ‚ÄòSunday Friends‚Äô. In 1947 the Belloncis, together with Guido Alberti, owner of the firm which produces the Strega liqueur, decided to inaugurate a prize for fiction, the winner being chosen by the Sunday friends. The activities of the Bellonci circle and the institution of the prize were seen as marking a tentative return to ‚Äònormality‚Äô in Italian cultural life: a feature of the reconstruction which followed the years of Fascism, war, occupation and liberation. The first winner of the Strega, elected by the Sunday Friends, was Ennio Flaiano, for his first and only novel Tempo di uccidere, which is set in Africa during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. It has been translated into English as The Short Cut. Maria Bellonci published a history of the Strega prize, titled Come un racconto gli anni del premio Strega, in 1971. The selection process Since the death of Maria Bellonci in 1986, the prize has been administered by the Fondazione Maria e Goffredo Bellonci. The members of the now 400-strong prize jury, drawn from Italy‚Äôs cultural elite, are still known as the Sunday Friends. For a book to be considered it must have the support of at least two Friends. This initial long list is whittled down at a first ballot to a short list of five. The second round of voting, followed by the proclamation of the victor, takes place on the first Thursday in July in the nymphaeum of the Villa Giulia, Rome. Sponsorship Telecom Italia have joined Liquore Strega as sponsors of the prize.

Royal Perth Yacht Club is a member of the International Council of Yacht Clubs.  Early history  The RPYC clubhouse in Crawley, Western Australia The Royal Perth Yacht Club can trace its origins to 1841 when a group of sailors staged a modest regatta to celebrate Foundation Day. In 1865 this original group of pioneer sailors formalised the Perth Yacht Club. Early regattas at the club included yacht races and gig rowing races. Duck hunting was also popular at this time. In 1880 a jetty was built at the foot of William Street on Perth Water. The clubhouse opened in 1889 and in 1890 it received the Royal charter and the Lords of the Admiralty granted the club the Royal Warrant to fly a blue ensign. In 1920, the clubhouse was extended and the club formed the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve in Western Australia. The club shifted to Crawley on Melville Water in 1953 when the William Street site, through siltation, became unusable.Details from text of description to records collection in Battye Library America's Cup Australia II on display at the WA Maritime Museum RPYC fielded the yacht Southern Cross in the 1974 America's Cup, the first aluminium yacht to compete in the regatta, and the yacht Australia in the 1977 America's Cup and the 1980 America's Cup. In 1983 an Australian syndicate representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club fielded the Australia II, skippered by John Bertrand, against defender Liberty, skippered by Dennis Conner. Australia II won the match races to win the America's Cup - the first winning challenge to the New York Yacht Club, which had successfully defended the cup over a period of 132 years. RPYC hosted the 1987 defence off Fremantle Harbour at a newly established annex during the Australian summer months between October 1986 and February 1987.The RPYC Annex - Developed for Ocean-based Facility for the America's Cup - Fishing Boat Harbour Trailitem 5 The American challenger Stars & Stripes 87, sailed by Dennis Conner, beat the Australian defender Kookaburra III, sailed by Iain Murray, four wins to nil in the best of seven series. This regatta marked the last time that 12-metre class yachts were used in the America's Cup. The entrance road to RPYC in Crawley was commemoratively renamed Australia II Drive. To mark the 30th anniversary of the America's Cup victory, the second mast of the Australia II was permanently installed by the foreshore outside the clubhouse from which the undefaced Blue ensign and Club burgee are flown.  Notable sailors and events  Olympic sailor Elise Rechichi A number of sailors from RPYC have competed in the Summer Olympics and Paralympics. These include: * Noel Robbins (Sonar Class - won gold at the 2000 Paralympics) * Jamie Dunross (Sonar Class - won gold at the 2000 Paralympics) * Graeme Martin (Sonar Class - won gold at the 2000 Paralympics, won bronze at the 2008 Paralympics, won gold at the 2016 Paralympics) * Elise Rechichi (470 Class - won gold at the 2008 Olympics) * Tessa Parkinson (470 Class - won gold at the 2008 Olympics) * Rachel Cox (Skud18 Class - won sliver at the 2008 Paralympics) * Colin Harrison (Sonar Class - won bronze at the 2008 Paralympics, won gold at the 2016 Paralympics) * Russel Boaden (Sonar Class - won bronze at the 2008 Paralympics, won gold at the 2016 Paralympics) In 1979, the RPYC organised the 20,000 kilometre Parmelia Race from Plymouth, England to Perth in order to mark the 150th anniversary of Western Australia.Parmelia line honours to Endeavour Sydney Morning Herald 22 November 1979 page 8 Competitors were invited to recreate the 1829 voyage of the merchant barque Parmelia bringing the first British settlers to the Swan River Colony. Jon Sanders was the first sailor to circumnavigate Antarctica solo, circling the continent twice from 1981 to 1982. Sanders is the record-holder for the longest distance ever sailed continuously by any vessel following his triple non-stop solo circumnavigation of the globe from 1986 to 1988. RPYC hosted the 2011 ISAF Sailing World Championships, a significant qualifying event for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Club flag At a general meeting in 1891, the old blue PYC burgee was replaced with a triangular St George's Cross with a St Edward's Crown in the upper canton.

Life  Hay√¢l√Æ lived in the Divan tradition. Though the exact birth date of the poet later called Hay√¢l√Æ is not known, it is known that he was born during the reign of Sultan B√¢yez√Æd II (1481‚Äì1512), in the city of Yenice-i Vardar in Macedonia. His real name was Mehmed (ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ). Apparently, Mehmed was interested in poetry from a very young age, as the biographer ‚Äò√Ç≈üƒ±k √áelebi recounts that he read the B√¥st√¢n (\\"The Orchard\\") and the G√ºlist√¢n (\\"The Rose Garden\\") of the Persian poet Sa‚Äòdi in his youth.≈ûent√ºrk 263 At some time during his youth, the wandering Sufi dervish Baba ‚ÄòAl√Æ Mest-i ‚ÄòAjem (\\"Father ‚ÄòAl√Æ the Drunkard of Persia\\") came to Yenice-i Vardar with his disciples, and Mehmed was attracted enough to him to leave home, join the group, and follow Baba ‚ÄòAl√Æ to Istanbul, the Ottoman capital. During the journey, he was further educated in poetry, as well as in Sufi thought and practice, by Baba ‚ÄòAl√Æ.Andrews 233‚Äì234 In Istanbul, one of the city's chief judges, Sarƒ± G√ºrz N√ªredd√Æn Efendi, saw the young Mehmed together with Baba ‚ÄòAl√Æ's band of dervishes, and‚Äîconsidering this inappropriate for the boy‚Äîhe removed him from among them and entrusted him to the care of one of the city's police chiefs. Here, he continued his education and also began to attract notice as a poet, writing under the name Hay√¢l√Æ (\\"the Imaginative\\"). Eventually, Hay√¢l√Æ came to the attention of ƒ∞br√¢h√Æm Pasha‚Äîthe Ottoman Grand Vizier at the time‚Äîand through him to the attention of Sultan S√ºleym√¢n I. He became one of the sultan's favored poets, was supported by him through the patronage system in place in the Ottoman court at the time, and accompanied the sultan's forces in their siege of the island of Rhodes in 1522 and the conquest of the city of Baghdad from the Persian Safavid Empire in 1534; during this latter campaign, Hay√¢l√Æ is rumored to have met the great Azerbaijani poet Fuz√ªl√Æ. For his poetic talents, Hay√¢l√Æ was given a number of informal titles: Melik-√º≈ü-≈üuar√¢ (\\"Sultan of poets\\"), Diy√¢r-ƒ± R√ªm'un Sult√¢n-ƒ± ≈ûuar√¢sƒ± (\\"Sultan of the Poets of the Western Lands\\"), and Hay√¢l√Æ-i me≈üh√ªr (\\"Hay√¢l√Æ the famous\\").Cengiz 375 Hay√¢l√Æ's popularity with the Grand Vizier and the sultan, however, also earned him many enemies among other poets, and he was frequently the subject of lampoons.Andrews 234 After the fall and execution of Hay√¢l√Æ's main patron ƒ∞br√¢h√Æm Pasha in 1536, and the ascension to the post of Grand Vizier of R√ºstem Pasha‚Äîwho was less tolerant towards the somewhat decadent lifestyle of the court‚ÄîHay√¢l√Æ's life became more difficult, and eventually he requested and was given the position of sancakbey, or governor of a provincial district, outside of Istanbul, near to the Thracian city of Edirne; this position allowed him to add the title bey to his name, and he is still often known as \\"Hay√¢l√Æ Bey\\". He died in Edirne in the year 1557.

The southernmost of Queensland's wet tropics river systems, it was named in 1864 by George Elphinstone Dalrymple explorer, after Robert George Wyndham Herbert, the first Premier of Queensland. Location and features With its headwaters forming at an elevation of on the Atherton Tableland, part of the Great Dividing Range west of Herberton and north of Ravenshoe, the Herbert River is formed by the confluence of the Millstream and the Wild River. The Herbert River flows in a generally southeastern direction through the Lumholtz National Park joined by fifteen tributaries including the Stone River and flowing past the town of Ingham. The Herbert River reaches its mouth where it enters the Coral Sea near Lucinda, at the southern end of the Hinchinbrook Channel, north of Townsville. The river descends over its course. The Herbert River tributaries include the Blunder, Sunday and Cameron Creeks, which all rise in the Cardwell Range and drain the northern portion of the river's catchment area, upstream of the Herbert River Falls. Further south the catchment is drained by the Nanyeta (Return) and Rudd Creeks, which flow out of the Great Dividing Range west of Mount Garnet and from the Forty Mile Scrub area. In total, the river has a catchment of . The Wallaman Falls on Stony Creek, another tributary of the Herbert, are Australia's tallest single-drop waterfall. Other waterfalls on the river include Herbert River Falls, Blencoe Falls and Millstream Falls. Heavy rainfall causes the river level and speed of flow to rise very quickly, especially in the lower flood plain areas around Ingham where rainfall of up to over a few days may occur during peak wet season. Floodwater up to depths of above ground level occurs in low parts of the town, requiring the evacuation of residents and their property from low- lying areas. The river experienced significant flooding during the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. People and land use Warrgamay (also known as Waragamai, Wargamay, Wargamaygan, Biyay, and Warakamai) is an Australian Aboriginal language in North Queensland. The language region includes the Herbert River area, Ingham, Hawkins Creek, Long Pocket, Herbert Vale, Niagara Vale, Yamanic Creek, Herbert Gorge, Cardwell, Hinchinbrook Island and the adjacent mainland. Warungu (also known as Warrungu, Warrongo, and Waroongoo.) is an Australian Aboriginal language in North Queensland. The language region includes areas from the Upper Herbert River to Mount Garnet. The catchment area holds a population of about 18,000, 75% of whom dwell in the lower flood plain area. The river's upper region is used mainly for cattle grazing, while the lower Herbert River floodplain is given over to sugar cane production.Cane Trains in the Herbert River Valley Stocks, I.L. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, December, 1972 pp242-264 The middle reaches of the catchment include National Parks, State Forests and sections of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Parts of the river, especially the Herbert River Gorge stretch, are used for kayaking and white water rafting. The Herbert River is one of Australia's two finest extended whitewater journeys, the other the Franklin River in Tasmania. The second season of the U.S. reality television series, Survivor, was filmed on the \\"Goshen\\" cattle station in the upper Herbert River region, near the Blencoe Falls and Herbert River Gorge. The Herbert, together with the Tully and the Burdekin rivers, were part of the proposed Bradfield Scheme to divert the upper reaches of the three rivers west of the Great Dividing Range and into the Thomson River designed to irrigate and drought-proof much of the western Queensland interior, as well as large areas of South Australia. The Scheme was proposed in 1938 and abandoned in 1947.

Career  Stern received her medical degree from the University of Toronto in 1939 and the following year migrated to the United States, where she became a naturalized citizen in 1943. She completed residencies at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and at Cedars of Lebanon and Good Samaritan Hospital, and was certified by the American Board of Pathology. She began her career as the Director of Laboratories and Research at the Cancer Detection Center of Los Angeles, California. During this time, Stern became interested in the progression of cervical cancer published her first papers on the subject. In 1961 she became a research coordinator at the University of Southern California Medical School and began teaching classes in the department of pathology at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical School. In 1963 she joined the UCLA School of Public Health as an associate researcher, and was promoted to professor of epidemiology at UCLA in 1965.  Research  Dr. Stern's research spanned multiple avenues of cervical cancer research, combining epidemiology and cytopathology to describe the progression and risk factors of cervical cancer. She was a driving force in defining dysplasia as the earliest histological sign of cervical cancer development. In 1963 she published a study describing 10,000 women that her team observed over a two-year time period. She found that the new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed at the end of the two-year period almost exclusively came from women that displayed cervical dysplasia at the beginning of the study. Future follow-up studies from her lab would further validate that dysplasia, although reversible, demonstrates increased risk for development of cervical cancer. In 1974 she published a paper detailing a 100-point scale for histological analysis of cervical cancer. This article described all stages of cervical cancer, including the earliest stages of dysplasia, and detailed the abnormal cellular morphology observed in each category. Today, following a routine Pap test, women that have dysplastic cervical cells are monitored closely for potential cervical cancer development. Dr. Stern was also interested in the possible connections between combined oral contraceptive pills and cervical cancer. She conducted epidemiological studies, surveying more than 10,000 women in the Los Angeles County area and keeping track of their contraceptive choice and Pap test results over a 7-year period. She found that women on the pill for the duration of the 7-year study had a 6-fold increased risk for the development of cervical cancer. Her results were published in Science in 1977, and helped prompt the reformulation of the high-dose Enovid birth control pill. In order to have access to the most high-risk patients, Dr. Stern's lab set up free women's medical clinics in poor communities of Los Angeles county. She set up several sociological and epidemiological studies to determine the factors that drive women to participate in free clinics and receive free preventative health care. Her team made several observations that remain true today: women need help with childcare, transportation, and more flexible hours, in order to take advantage of free medical services. They also noted that many women were more willing to participate in their studies if the physician or nurse performing the exam was also a woman.

This allowed the development of effective diagnostic techniques and prophylactic measures (excision of abnormal tissue), which, combined with this cancer's slow rate of metastasis, reduced its fatality rate drastically.

He first rose to prominence as the author of the memoir My Traitor's Heart, which, like the bulk of his work, deals with South African society in a historical and contemporary perspective and focuses on racial relations. As a journalist, he has written for major newspapers in South Africa, Britain and the United States.  Personal background  Malan grew up in a middle-class and pro-apartheid Afrikaner family in a white suburb of Johannesburg. He attended Blairgowrie Primary School in Randburg where one of his contemporaries was the columnist, Jani Allan. He then attended Woodmead School, South Africa's first non- racially based high school. He has described how, as a teenager, he formed a rock band that associated with black artists and wanted to rebel against the apartheid system, at a time when he in fact had virtually no interaction with black people. He attended the then Witwatersrand University for a year. To avoid conscription, which was compulsory for all white males, he moved to Los Angeles in 1977 and worked as a journalist.  As a memoirist: My Traitor's Heart  Returning to South Africa in the 1980s, he wrote My Traitor's Heart, his memoir of growing up in Apartheid-era South Africa in which he explores race relations through prominent murder cases. In addition, he reflects on the history of his family, a prominent Afrikaner clan that migrated to the Cape in the 17th century and included Daniel Fran√ßois Malan, the South African Prime Minister who was a principal ideological force behind Apartheid doctrine. The book, which became a best-seller, was translated into 11 languages.  Journalism  Malan began his journalistic career in 1975, as a reporter for The Star. During his stay in the US, he served as managing editor for Music Connection (1978), as news editor for LA Weekly (1979), as staff writer for New West Magazine (California) (1981), as senior writer for Los Angeles Herald-Examiner (1984) and as senior editor for Manhattan Magazine (1984). Since then, he has been a freelance writer for various magazines, mainly in the US (e.g. Esquire, Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal), Britain (e.g. The Spectator and The Sunday Times) and South Africa (e.g. The Star, Time and Noseweek). A number of his essays are collected in the volume The Lion Sleeps Tonight and other stories of South Africa (New York: Grove Press, 2012), . The Lion Sleeps Tonight In 2000, he wrote a widely disseminated piece in Rolling Stone about the origin of the song \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\", tracing its history from its first recording by Solomon Linda, a penniless Zulu singer, through its adoption by The Weavers, The Tokens and many of the folksingers of the 1960s, and its appropriation by The Walt Disney Company in the movie The Lion King. Malan reveals that Linda never received any royalties for the song; however, an ensuing court case established that 25 percent of the song's past and future royalties should go to Linda's three daughters.  AIDS controversy  Malan has generated controversy by repeatedly questioning the seriousness and scope of AIDS in Africa. In articles in Rolling Stone, The Spectator and Noseweek, a controversial South African monthly, he proposed that AIDS statistics are greatly exaggerated by researchers and health professionals who are trying to obtain more funding. His hypothesis was roundly criticised by national and international AIDS organisations, and Malan was accused of endangering lives in Africa. In an interview in the Afrikaans magazine, Insig, Malan said, 'I get a kick out of it when the Treatment Action Campaign attacks me; it's like sport.' In 2007, he said, 'In truth, I never claimed that Aids was not a problem ‚Äì on the contrary, I described it as a terrible affliction that was claiming countless lives. At the same time however, it was clear that Aids numbers were being exaggerated and good news suppressed. I stand by that story.' As a television documentarist In 1990, Malan appeared as the presenter of an episode of BBC Television's Omnibus, titled Tales of Ordinary Murder: Rian Malan in South Africa. In 1994, he appeared as the presenter of BBC Television's travel documentary, Great Railway Journeys (series 2, episode 2). The episode was titled Cape Town to the Lost City. In 2004, he appeared in an episode of Channel 4's Without Walls, titled The Last Afrikaner. A Search with Rian Malan, written by Malan and directed by Don Boyd. In 2005, his struggle for justice for the heirs of Solomon Linda (see above) was documented in A Lion's Trail, directed by Fran√ßois Verster. In 2009, Malan, together with Lloyd Ross, produced the documentary The Splintering Rainbow for Al Jazeera. The film documents a journey through South Africa, investigating unfolding political dramas and taking the pulse of the Rainbow Nation.  Musical career  He has released a CD of his own songs, titled Alien Inboorling.Alien Inboorling Shifty Music/Sony BMG, 2005 The title translates as \\"Alien native\\"; the songs were described by one journalist as \\"parables of contemporary South Africa told in the voices of Afrikaners who have stayed and those who have left. The songs are dusty, weary, a stream of consciousness for the Afrikaans 'tribe'.\\" The CD was listed as number 23 on Afrikaans newspaper Beeld's list of . He also performs with Hot Club d'Afrique, a gypsy jazz band.Gert Vlok Nel and Rian Malan tour to Netherlands and UK, Media Update, 13 Jan 2009 Malan contributed lyrics to Stoomradio and Opgestook, the first two albums by Afrikaans roots music/boeremusiek band Radio Kalahari Orkes and appears on guitar on their second CD, Die NagloperDie Nagloper, Radio Kalahari Orkes Terraplane Entertainment/Sony BMG, 2007 He also contributed lyrics to Say Africa by Vusi Mahlasela.

These resources served as sources of funding for Shu's military campaigns against its rival state Wei.(ÊÅ¢Ë∫´ÂæÄÊí≤Ë®éÔºåÈâèÁõ°ÊÉ°È°ûÔºåÂæôÂÖ∂Ë±™Â∏•‰∫éÊàêÈÉΩÔºåË≥¶Âá∫Âèü„ÄÅÊøÆËÄïÁâõÊà∞È¶¨ÈáëÈäÄÁäÄÈù©ÔºåÂÖÖÁπºËªçË≥áÔºå‰∫éÊôÇË≤ªÁî®‰∏ç‰πè„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43.

Early life Mercier Descloux grew up in Lyon, France, but returned to her native Paris in her teens to attend art school. With her partner, Michel Esteban, she helped establish the store Harry Cover, temple of the punk movement in France, and the new wave magazine Rock News. She struck up friendships with Patti Smith and Richard Hell when visiting New York in 1975, and both contributed material to her first book, Desiderata. She and Esteban moved to New York in 1977, meeting Michael Zilkha, with whom Esteban formed ZE Records. Musical career With guitarist D.J. Barnes (Didier Esteban), Mercier Descloux formed the performance art duo Rosa Yemen, and recorded an eponymous mini-album for ZE Records in 1978. The following year, ZE released her solo debut LP, Press Color. Self-taught as a guitarist, she expressed herself as a minimalist within the no wave genre, concentrating on single-note lines combined with wrong-note harmonies and funky rhythms. While the record had poor sales, she toured in the USA and Europe. Island Records boss Chris Blackwell bankrolled the sessions in Nassau, Bahamas for her second album, Mambo Nassau, with Compass Point All Stars engineer Steven Stanley and keyboardist Wally Badarou co-writing and producing. The album was influenced by African music as well as art rock, funk and soul. While the record was unsuccessful in the USA, it won her a contract with CBS Records in France. Returning to France, she released two singles before travelling through Africa, drawing on the music of Soweto for the infectious \\"Mais o√π Sont Pass√©es les Gazelles?\\" ('But where have the gazelles gone?'), a hit in France in 1984, and the award-winning album Zulu Rock, with producer Adam Kidron. Collaborating further with Kidron as a producer, she recorded the albums One for the Soul (1986) in Brazil with the jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, and later Suspense (1988) in London with the American musician Mark Cunningham of Mars. She also acted, composed film scores, and wrote poetry. In the mid 1990s, she moved to Corsica and devoted herself to painting and to writing an unpublished novel. Death In 2003, she was diagnosed with ovarian and colon cancers, from which she died the following year. Fellow no wave musician and ZE labelmate Cristina dedicated a song on the 2004 re-release of her album Sleep It Off to Mercier Descloux, \\"ch√®re copine in adversity ... In loving memory of her talent, her courage, and her kindness.\\" After her death, Esteban worked with the record label Light in the Attic to reissue some of her recordings.

Life Fei Shi was from Nan'an County (ÂçóÂÆâÁ∏£), Qianwei Commandery (ÁäçÁÇ∫ÈÉ°), which is around present-day Leshan, Sichuan. He originally served under Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), as the Prefect of Mianzhu County (Á∂øÁ´πÁ∏£). In 214, after the warlord Liu Bei seized control of Yi Province from Liu Zhang, Fei Shi came into the service of Liu Bei. Between 214 and 219, Fei Shi held a number of appointments in Liu Bei's administration, including Administrator (Â§™ÂÆà) of Zangke Commandery (ÁâÇÁâÅÈÉ°). Around 219, after Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong, he tasked Fei Shi with travelling to Jing Province to inform Guan Yu about his appointment as General of the Vanguard (ÂâçÂ∞áËªç). In 221, when Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established the Shu Han state, Fei Shi wrote a memorial to express his strong objection to Liu Bei's coronation. He argued that Liu Bei should not declare himself emperor until he had vanquished Shu's rival state, Cao Wei, which replaced the Eastern Han dynasty in 220; he cited the example of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han dynasty, who only declared himself emperor after defeating his rival Xiang Yu in the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention. Liu Bei was so displeased that he had Fei Shi imprisoned and later demoted to serve as a low-ranking official in Yongchang Commandery (Ê∞∏ÊòåÈÉ°) in the remote southern parts of Shu. In 225, Fei Shi accompanied Zhuge Liang on the southern campaign against rebel forces in southern Shu's Nanzhong region. Later, when Zhuge Liang launched a series of military campaigns against Shu's rival state Wei, Fei Shi remained in the Shu capital Chengdu to handle domestic affairs. He was appointed as a Counsellor Remonstrant (Ë´´Ë≠∞Â§ßÂ§´) sometime after Zhuge Liang's death in 234, when Jiang Wan was the head of government in Shu. He died not long later.

He is best known for his political writings. Lupold was born at Bebenburg castle around 1297to of a Franconian family of ministeriales. With the financial support of a canonry at W√ºrzburg Cathedral, he studied canon law at Bologna under Johannes Andreae. He graduated doctor decretorum in 1316. After returning to Germany, he became provost of the church of St Severus in Erfurt in 1326, a canon of Mainz Cathedral in 1327, then archdeacon at W√ºrzburg and a canon at Bamberg Cathedral in 1329. From 1328 he was intermittently an episcopal official at W√ºrzburg. This important position allowed him to play a part in episcopal elections and political decision-making. He was an influential figure in the diocese of W√ºrzburg.J√ºrgen Miethke, \\"Practical Intentions of Scholasticism: The Example of Political Theory\\", in William James Courtenay and J√ºrgen Miethke, eds., Universities and Schooling in Medieval Society (Leiden: Brill, 2000), pp. 225‚Äì26. In 1338 Lupold was excommunicated by the pope for having taken the side of the Emperor Louis IV. He was not absolved until 1351. On 12 January 1353 he was elected bishop of Bamberg, his native diocese, and remained there until his death on 28 October 1363. In the struggle between Louis IV and Popes John XXII, Benedict XII, and Clement VI, Lupold was among the jurists who took the emperor's side. His treatise De juribus regni et imperii Romanorum,First published by J. Wimpfeling in Strasbourg in 1508; then S. Schard, in De jurisdictione, auctoritate, et pr√¶eminentia imperiali ac potestate ecclesiastica variis auctoribus scripta, Basel, 1566. dedicated to Louis' supporter, the elector Baldwin of Trier, deals less with abstract ideas and Aristotelian politics than with historical considerations.

Merrie Melodies animated cartoon short directed by Chuck Jones. The cartoon was released on April 22, 1939, and is the first Daffy Duck cartoon directed by Jones. Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur is set in a chronologically twisted Stone Age and features Daffy Duck, a caveman named Casper (a caricature of Jack Benny), and his pet Apatosaurus, Fido. This is the last cartoon with the Vitaphone intro, which was first used in The Phantom Ship in 1936. Plot Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur, full movie Casper (a caveman) and Fido (an apatosaur) go hunting for breakfast and come upon Daffy. Casper uses a slingshot to fire a rock at the duck who, until he realizes the danger, is casually floating along in a lake. He revs up to amazing speed, though barely keeping ahead of the rock. Finally, Daffy slides to a halt and, disguised as a traffic cop, causes the rock to wait while a swan crosses, as though at an intersection. After that, Daffy waves the rock through and takes off in the other direction. The rock realizes it has been tricked and backtracks but Daffy races between Casper's and Fido's legs. Fido, bending down to peer between his legs to see where Daffy has gone, has his head impacted by the rock. The dazed dinosaur performs a silly dance before floating to the ground, asleep. Casper, upon seeing Daffy behaving decidedly not like a regular duck in water, says, \\"Gosh, that duck acts like he's crazy.\\" Daffy replies, \\"That is correct; absolutely one-hundred percent correct!\\" and snaps the rubber of Casper's slingshot into the caveman's face. Casper decides to dive in after the duck and strips down. As he dives in, Daffy holds up a sign which indicates no swimming is allowed; Casper freezes in mid-dive then retreats to shore. After ordering Fido to retrieve Daffy, which results only in Fido tying his own neck in a knot, the two leave. Daffy, however, knows that Casper will not give up, so he paints an image of himself on a rock. Indeed, Casper returns with a club, sees the image and bashes it; the reverberation courses through his body. Daffy gives the caveman a glass of water, which cures the issue and results in Casper thanking the duck and offering to shake hands. Daffy gives him a card advertising \\"...the biggest, most luscious Duck...\\" Casper and Fido head off in the direction indicated on the card, following a series of billboards (parodying advertising techniques of the era, including references to \\"The Breakfast of Champions\\" and \\"The Pause that Refreshes\\") Daffy has erected. They eventually reach an inflatable balloon duck which is being pumped up by Daffy. Casper is terrified by this until Daffy hands him a knife. Casper marches over and stabs the huge, angry- looking balloon duck. The ensuing explosion kills them all. The short ends showing the three in Heaven, lounging on clouds. Fido plays a harp while Daffy and Casper think about their mistakes. Daffy laments, \\"You know, maybe that wasn't such a hot idea after all!\\" Invoking Jack Benny's usual farewell, Casper says, \\"Good night, folks.\\" as the scene irises out. Production notes Most of Chuck Jones-directed cartoons from this era (such as the ones featuring Sniffles the Mouse) were very heavily inspired by Walt Disney's cartoon shorts, placing more emphasis on story and animation than gags. Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur shows the faintest hints of deviation from such cartoons, which eventually led to the fast-paced Jones cartoons of the 1940s, such as The Dover Boys and The Draft Horse. This is also an important milestone in the evolution of Daffy Duck's personality. While Tex Avery and Bob Clampett had depicted Daffy as completely insane, irrational, and uncontrollable in their previous cartoons with the character, Jones depicted Daffy here as somewhat more thoughtful and calculating. Jones and Friz Freleng continued to develop Daffy's personality in this direction throughout the 1940s and 1950s.

He previously served under the warlords Yuan Shao, Zhang Yang and Cao Cao consecutively during the late Eastern Han dynasty. Service under Yuan Shao Dong Zhao was a xiaolian and served as a county official in his early years under the warlord Yuan Shao before being promoted to a military adviser. He was appointed as the governing official of several counties and commanderies in Yuan Shao's territories and governed them well. However, Yuan Shao listened to slanderous rumours and began to doubt Dong Zhao's loyalty towards him. Dong Zhao was fearful that Yuan Shao might kill him and he fled. Service under Zhang Yang Dong Zhao wanted to flee to where Emperor Xian was. On the way, he passed by Henei Commandery, which was governed by the warlord Zhang Yang. Zhang Yang let Dong Zhao join him and appointed him as an official. In 192, when Cao Cao wanted to seek permission to pass through Zhang Yang's territory to receive Emperor Xian from exile, Zhang Yang initially refused, but after Dong Zhao's persuasion he agreed. Dong Zhao followed Cao Cao to receive the emperor. Service under Cao Cao In 196, Emperor Xian met Cao Cao, who received him with all due respect after heeding Dong Zhao's suggestion. After the death of Zhang Yang, Dong Zhao went to persuade Zhang Yang's followers to join Cao Cao. By then, Dong Zhao had formally entered Cao Cao's service. In 199, after Cao Cao seized back Xu Province from Liu Bei, Dong Zhao was appointed as the Governor of Xu Province. Subsequently, Dong Zhao followed Cao Cao on the campaigns against Yuan Shao and the Wuhuan tribes and was promoted to even higher official positions. In 216, Dong Zhao aided Cao Cao by persuading Emperor Xian to confer on Cao Cao the title of a vassal king ‚Äì King of Wei. In 219, while Guan Yu was attacking Fancheng, Sun Quan agreed to send reinforcements to help the entrapped Cao Ren. To keep things secret, Dong Zhao proposed a trick of tying the messages written on paper onto arrows which were fired into the city. When Cao Ren's troops heard that Sun Quan was willing to send reinforcements, the army's morale was boosted and eventually culminated in Guan Yu's defeat. Service in Wei In 220, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Han dynasty. Throughout the reign of Cao Pi and his successor Cao Rui, Dong Zhao played an important role in state affairs by providing suggestions and advice to the emperors. He managed to predict the movements and decisions of the enemy accurately a few times and saved the Wei armies from defeat, such as during a campaign against the rival state of Eastern Wu in which Dong Zhao predicted correctly that there would be an ambush. Highly recognised for his contributions to the state, Dong Zhao was promoted to even higher official positions. In 236, Dong Zhao died at the age of 81 (by East Asian age reckoning) and was given a posthumous title of a marquis.

Although unsigned, the place of writing given (Mount Independence) makes it likely that the author of the introduction is John McAleer, Rex Stout's official biographer. Bantam, Goldsborough's publisher, later inserted a note in books explaining that McAleer was indeed the author, and that it was never Bantam's intention to make a mystery out of the identity of the author of the introductory essay. Background In the Rex Stout corpus of Nero Wolfe stories, heavy use is made at times of a symbiotic relationship between Nero Wolfe and a fictional New York newspaper, the Gazette. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's right-hand man, and a senior editor at the paper, Lon Cohen, are long-time poker buddies, stretching back to the early Wolfe stories. However, none of Stout's stories involve the inner structure of the Gazette. Catalyst to murder In Death on Deadline, the current owners of the Gazette are getting old, and a Scottish press baron, Ian MacLaren, is expressing an interest in acquiring the Gazette as part of his quest to own a major paper in the largest city of every English-speaking country (he already has the others). Lon Cohen confides this to Archie at their weekly poker game, and Wolfe becomes concerned on a number of fronts: he likes the newspaper the way it is, he has heard bad things about MacLaren's other newspapers, and his preferred relationship with the press may be threatened (Cohen, in particular, would quit/retire if MacLaren took over). After sending Archie on a mission to get samples of several of MacLaren's newspapers for more detailed examination, Wolfe becomes alarmed enough to place a full-page advertisement in 'The New York Times' to publicly question whether MacLaren is a suitable owner of the newspaper and to offer assistance to any parties that agree with his point of view. Characters, in order of appearance * Nero Wolfe ‚Äî semi-retired great sedentary legendary detective on the Lower West Side of Manhattan * Archie ‚Äî Wolfe's right-hand man, and teller of the Wolfe stories in the first person * Saul Panzer ‚Äî Another recurring character in the Wolfe canon, an (implicitly) Jewish operative, top quality, who lives alone in his own apartment and hosts weekly poker games to which Lon Cohen, Archie, and Fred Durkin (qqv below), among others, are invited * Fred Durkin ‚Äî Another independent detective Wolfe frequently uses. Not as sharp or as expensive as Panzer, but frequently easier to book on short notice. * Bill Gore ‚Äî Yet another freelancer. Gore's character is not developed much in either the Rex Stout or Goldsborough stories, but is another name to insert when one is needed. * Ian MacLaren ‚Äî Scottish press baron, lately showing an interest in gaining control of the Gazette at which Lon Cohen is a senior editor. The story begins when the threat of a takeover by MacLaren rattles Lon so that he plays badly at Saul's poker game. * Gershmann ‚Äî another Wolfe client, case ongoing when the story opens. Closing that case immediately provides an infusion of cash to the Wolfe operation, which is expensive; see the main Nero Wolfe article for insight on that point. Otherwise Gershmann plays no part in the present case. * Studs Terkel ‚Äî not a fictional person but a real author whom the fictional Wolfe likes, and by implication Goldsborough as well. In the present novel, Wolfe is reading Terkel's book The Good War. This book-within-a-book theme is found throughout many of the Wolfe stories, even the shorter ones. For a parallel case in which the book-within-a-book is much more famous than the Wolfe story itself, a good example is Lancelot Hogben's Mathematics for the Million, which provides a vital hint in \\"The Zero Clue\\". * Fritz Brenner ‚Äî Master chef and cook for the four men living in Wolfe's old brownstone. Functionally he also serves as a foil for Archie to explain his ideas without the high-minded slant favored by Wolfe. * Harriett Haverhill ‚Äî largest single shareholder (about 35%) of the Gazette, second wife and now widow of Wilkins Haverhill who bought the paper back in the 1930s, related by marriage to the other major shareholders: David Haverhill (stepson, about 17%), Donna Palmer (divorced stepdaughter now living in Boston, also 17%). Carolyn Haverhill, wife of David, although not a shareholder, is quickly apparent as the sharpest of the younger Haverhills. Finally there is Scott Haverhill, Harriett's step-nephew. * Elliot Dean ‚Äî Harriett Haverhill's long-time lawyer, who accompanies Harriett on her visit to Wolfe's office following the Times advertisement, despite advising her against coming and also against her own wishes. Harriet and Elliot are Wolfe's first visitors following his Times advertisement. Dean holds 2‚Äì3% of the Gazettes stock. * Demarest family (owners of the Gazette before Wilkins bought it) and Arlen Publishing ‚Äî owners of slightly more than 12% of the Gazette * Inspector Cramer of the Manhattan police. * Audrey MacLaren ‚Äî ex-wife of Ian MacLaren, now living in Connecticut, firmly believes Ian caused Harriet's death and engages Wolfe to investigate * Scott Haverhill ‚Äî Harriet's step-nephew, owner of 10% of the Gazette. He tells Wolfe that Harriet has offered him the position of Publisher, provided that he sells his 10% of the Gazette to Harriet's trust. * Carl Bishop ‚Äî Publisher of the Gazette, holder of 5% of its stock. He plans to retire soon. D√©nouement * Wolfe sends Saul Panzer to visit Harriett's former executive secretary * Wolfe calls the parties together in his brownstone * First he summarizes the narrowly divided stock situation described above, including Scott's presumed defection to Harriett's camp, removing her incentive for suicide, at least by appearances. * Next, Wolfe notes that MacLaren and Harriett met privately in the Gazette executive suite shortly before the fatal gunshot(s). * Based on how quickly MacLaren said knew Wolfe had accepted Audrey MacLaren as a client and, but rejecting MacLaren's explanation as mendacious, Wolfe immediately suspected MacLaren had a confederate within the Harriett Haverhill camp. By assuming that person was Elliott Dean as accounting for Ian's false explanation, it also meant that a defection of Dean to the MacLaren camp was a counter-coup for MacLaren giving him narrowly more than 50% share of the stock. Therefore, he speculated that the MacLaren/Haverhill confrontation had 3 phases *# MacLaren said he had enough commitments to gain a controlling interest *# Citing Scott's defection, Harriett claimed victory *# MacLaren cited Dean's counterdefection, giving him barely more than 50%, at which point the conservation degenerated into a shouting match and MacLaren left. * At this point, Wolfe conjectures that Harriett summoned Dean to her office, which had been her dead husband's office years before and still contained a long- forgotten pistol inside its desk. Since her own days were numbered anyway, Wolfe speculates that she attempted to kill Elliott, but that he wrested the gun away from Harriett and later shot her. * Dean breaks down and says, among other things, \\"she was dying anyway'.

The Crow Museum opened to the public on December 5, 1998, as a gift to the people and visitors of Dallas from Mr. and Mrs. Trammell Crow. The museum is a member of the Dallas Arts District. The interior was designed by Booziotis and Company Architects of Dallas. History Trammell and Margaret Crow. Trammell and Margaret Crow bought their first piece of Asian art in the mid-1960s. The Crows have traveled extensively throughout the world, but Asia was a favorite destination. Pieces from Southeast Asian countries such as China, Japan, and India were added as the Crows' travels continued, evolving into a distinguished collection featuring artwork spanning 3500 B.C. to the early 20th century. The idea for the museum came about when Mr. and Mrs. Crow decided they would like to keep the collection intact as a legacy for their children and grandchildren, and the general public. The artwork, which ranges from including examples of Chinese jades, Buddhist sculpture, and Japanese screen paintings, had been displayed in lobbies, reception, and office areas of the Trammell Crow Center, other office buildings, marts, hotels, and in the homes of the Crows and their children prior to the formation of a museum. \\"Because the art was scattered between commercial buildings and our families' homes, we had little notion of what kind of a collection we had until pieces were gathered for the exhaustive selection process,\\" Mrs. Crow said. In total, the Crow family has amassed more than 4,000 pieces of Asian art, among which the 569 best were selected, after extensive analysis, by a noted curator for inclusion in The Crow Collection. At that point, the interior of the Pavilion at the Trammell Crow Center was redesigned and renovated to meet the special needs of a gallery displaying centuries-old art year-round. A son of the family, Trammell S. Crow, serves as president of the Crow Family Foundation and oversees the development of The Crow Collection. The Crow Museum was partially closed for the majority of 2018 as it underwent renovations and an expansion. After years of thoughtful planning and development, the museum dramatically expanded its footprint along the southwest corner of Harwood and Flora Streets in the Dallas Arts District. Oglesby Greene Architects of Dallas, which handled earlier renovations of the museum, led the expansion project. The Beck Group was the general contractor. In September 2018, the Crow Collection changed their name to the Crow Museum of Asian Art, a name that reflects not only the breadth of the collection and programming but also the museum's wide and diverse community support. Additionally, the Crow Museum formally launched the Center for Contemplative Leadership with programming focused around The Charter for Compassion. Coupled with mindfulness-based art education programming in the museum, this initiative promotes increases awareness, productivity, and compassion for self and others through classes and workshops that explore mindfulness. It was announced in January 2019 that the University of Texas at Dallas would acquire the Museum. The deal includes establishment of a second Crow Museum location at the UT-Dallas campus in Richardson.Michael Granberry, \\"UT Dallas acquires Crow Museum of Asian Art, advancing its place in the region's arts scene\\", The Dallas Morning News, January 24, 2019. Retrieved 2019-01-25. Permanent collection The Seated Daoist Deity fountain at the Crow Collection The majority of works comprising the Trammell and Margaret Crow collection have been obtained from individual purchases through private dealers and auction houses, as well as through the acquisition of major collections, such as the highly respected Morrie A. Moss collection. The Crow Museum of Asian Art has three galleries. Gallery I, located on the first floor, is where Japanese art is exhibited, except when travelling exhibitions are on display. The Lotus Shop and garden flank Gallery I. Gallery II occupies the second floor. Chinese artifacts are displayed in Gallery II, as well as in the mezzanine. The jade collection, one of the finest in the US and a pillar of the Crow Collection, is located here. Most of the items are from the 18th century, when the traditional Chinese jade industry (before the arrival of the industrial age) reached its zenith. A number of Qing Dynasty snuff bottles are on display as well. The Skybridge, a glass structure held up by steel beams connecting Gallery II and Gallery III, offers views of the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Trammell Crow Center, and overlooks The Seated Daoist Deity fountain. Gallery III is the primary site for works of art from Southeast Asia and India. Gallery III is dominated by the Mugal wall, which is hung from the ceiling due to its extreme weight, and two Indian gazebos. One of these \\"baradari,\\" used in gardens of Indian palaces and residences for relaxation and meditation, spent years at the Crow family farm in East Texas before its selection for the collection.The Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on December 4, 1943 and features Elmer Fudd, with a dog and cat that look similar to Willoughby the Dog and Claude Cat. The voice of A. Flea is uncredited and was provided by Sara Berner, except for the character screaming \\"T-Bone!\\" which was done by Mel Blanc. Blanc also performs the voice of the dog and the cat. As usual, Arthur Q. Bryan is the voice of Elmer. A. Flea would make another appearance in 1947's A Horse Fly Fleas, directed by Robert McKimson, in which the \\"A\\" in the flea's name is revealed to stand for \\"Anthony\\". Plot synopsis Elmer Fudd is laughing while lounging in his easy chair and reading his comic book (which is later revealed to have Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig on its cover), his dog nearby, sleeping comfortably in front of the fireplace. All is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by, dressed in a farmer's-type outfit with a big straw hat, and carrying a satchel inscribed \\"A. Flea\\". Pulling out his telescope and spotting the dog, he whistles and shouts in excitement before beginning to sing \\"Food Around the Corner\\", which becomes a recurring theme throughout the cartoon. Having awakened the dog by bouncing off his nose, the flea, hiding by the animal's ear, begins softly crooning so as to lull him back to sleep. This is successful, so the flea finds a suitable portion to begin eating. He takes a bite, which immediately jolts the dog awake, \\"Yipe! Agony, agony, agony!\\" He then begins scratching and biting, causing A. Flea to run, though he manages to make it so the dog bites himself. Elmer reacts, after the dog has leapt, whining, into his lap, by employing the use of flea powder. The flea is not phased, he simply skates on the powder as if it is ice. Elmer threatens to give the dog a bath if he witnesses him scratching again, which the dog - thinking about how much he hates baths - promises not to do. A. Flea continues searching for and measuring out various selections of the dog's person; he makes use of pickaxes, jackhammers and even explosives while the dog tries to withstand the itching and the overall pain. At one point, he deliberately angers the cat in order to enjoy the claws scratching his back. An angry- looking Elmer catches them and they both retreat as if they have been scolded. Finally, after A. Flea sets off an explosion in his fur, the dog cannot stand it any longer. Yelping and dragging his posterior across the floor, at one point he stops briefly and says to viewers, \\"Hey, I better cut this out. I may get to like it.\\" (reportedly an attempt by Clampett to bait the Hays Office censors, who ultimately left the gag intact). Elmer advances and the dog, realizing a bath is imminent, brakes and slides to a halt. He begs not to be taken for the bath, but Elmer grabs him and begins dragging him toward the inevitable. Suddenly, the flea is on Elmer, who begins to scratch. The dog then proceeds to carry him for a bath. There is a bar of soap on the floor on which the dog slips, landing both of them in the kitchen sink. The flea soon carries the two away on a plate, labelled as a \\"Blue Plate special\\", while singing about no more Meatless Tuesdays. Upon witnessing A. Flea carrying the dog and Elmer out of the house, Elmer's cat remarks,\\"Well, now I've seen everything.\\" He then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head with a pistol (the shooting is cut from all modern airings).

The term is mainly used in the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, although discussions on fuel poverty are increasing across Europe,EU Fuel Poverty Network http://www.fuelpoverty.eu and the concept also applies everywhere in the world where poverty and cold may be present.  Definitions  In the UK, fuel poverty is defined by the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act as: ‚Äúa person is to be regarded as living \\"in fuel poverty\\" if he is a member of a household living on a lower income in a home which cannot be kept warm at reasonable cost‚Äù. date = 2000 title = Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act author = UK Government URL = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/31/contents publisher = UK National Renewable Energy Centre (Narec) access date = 2013-10-28 }} Statistically, this used to be defined as a household needing to spend more than 10% of its income to maintain an adequate heating regime. However, definitions of \\"income\\" and \\"adequate heating regime\\" vary between UK Government and Devolved Administrations. A new, more complex definition of fuel poverty is now used in the UK, based on the Hills review. This gave the following definition: fuel poverty is now defined as when a household‚Äôs required fuel costs are above the median level, and if they were to spend what is required, then the household would be left with a residual income below the official poverty line. Additionally, a Fuel Poverty Indicator has been created, which shows how far into fuel poverty households are, not simply if they are in poverty or not. In Eastern Europe (transition economies), the term energy poverty is sometimes used instead.Buzar, S. Energy Poverty in Eastern Europe: Hidden Geographies of Deprivation. Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007. However, this use of the term (which is about a lack of access to energy services due to economic poverty) can be confused with indicating a lack of any access to energy infrastructure, as has been used by the World Economic Forum when establishing its Energy Poverty Action (EPA) initiative in 2005 to address energy poverty in the developing world by implementing electrification schemes (grid-extension and off-grid). Causes of fuel poverty Fuel poverty is caused by a convergence of three factors: * low income, which is often linked to absolute poverty * high fuel prices, including the use of relatively expensive fuel sources (such as electricity in the UK, aggravated by higher tariffs for low-volume energy users) * poor energy efficiency of a home, e.g. through low levels of insulation and old or inefficient heating systems The sharp rise in fuel prices from 2006-8 has led to an estimated doubling of the numbers in fuel poverty in countries where it is a major problem. A number of illnesses, including cancer can exacerbate the problems associated with fuel poverty. Efforts to shift away from fossil fuels and replace oil and coal with renewable energy sources do so at the expense of increased inequality.{https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190712151926.htm}} United Kingdom Fuel poverty has been the focus of political action since the early 1970s . In early 2008 it was estimated by Energywatch that there were around 4.4 million households in fuel poverty in the UK, with just over 3 million in England alone: this was more than double the number in 2003By April 2011 a YouGov survey indicated that the number of households in fuel poverty had risen to 6.3 million households, representing approximately 24% of all households in the UK.6.3 million or almost a quarter of all households are now in fuel poverty uSwitch, published 2011-07-06, accessed 2011-07-11.

Background Bavaud was a Catholic theology student, attending the Saint Ilan Seminary, Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, and a member of an anti- communist student group in France called Compagnie du Myst√®re. The group's leader, Marcel Gerbohay, had great influence over Bavaud. Gerbohay claimed that he was a member of the Romanov Dynasty, and convinced Bavaud that when communism was destroyed, the Romanovs would once again rule Russia, in the person of Gerbohay. Bavaud believed what Gerbohay had told him, became obsessed with the idea that killing Hitler would help the plans to materialise, and finally decided to carry out the assassination himself. Attempts On October 9, 1938, Bavaud travelled from Brittany to Baden- Baden, then on to Basel, where he bought a Schmeisser 6.35 mm (.25 ACP) semi- automatic pistol. In Berlin, a policeman, Karl Deckert, overheard Bavaud saying that he would like to meet Hitler personally. Deckert advised Bavaud that a private audience could be arranged if Bavaud could obtain a letter of introduction from a suitable foreign VIP. Deckert advised him to travel to Munich for the anniversary of the 1923 \\"Beer Hall Putsch\\", which Hitler attended every year. Bavaud followed those instructions by buying a ticket for a seat on the reviewing stand by posing as a Swiss reporter, intending to shoot Hitler as he passed during the parade. Bavaud abandoned this attempt when, on November 9, Hitler turned out to be marching in the company of other Nazi leaders whom Bavaud did not want to injure. Bavaud next purchased expensive stationery and forged a letter of introduction in the name of the French nationalist leader Pierre Taittinger, which claimed that Bavaud had a second letter for Hitler's eyes only. He travelled to Berchtesgaden in the belief that Hitler had returned there, only to find that Hitler was still in Munich. When Bavaud returned to Munich, he discovered that Hitler was just leaving for Berchtesgaden. Arrest and trial Having exhausted his money, Bavaud stowed away on a train to Paris, where he was discovered by a conductor who turned him over to the police. He was interrogated by the Gestapo and admitted his plans to assassinate Hitler. Bavaud was tried by the Volksgerichtshof on December 18, 1939, naming as his motives that he considered Hitler a danger to humanity in general, to Swiss independence, and to Catholicism in Germany. Swiss diplomacy made no effort to save Bavaud. Hans Fr√∂licher, the Swiss ambassador to Germany, even publicly condemned Bavaud's assassination attempt. An offer from the Germans to exchange Bavaud for a German spy was turned down, and Bavaud was sentenced to death. He was executed by guillotine in the Berlin-Pl√∂tzensee prison on the morning of May 14, 1941. Aftermath Bavaud's father Alfred attempted to rehabilitate his son's name and reputation, resulting in a court decision on December 12, 1955 reverting the death sentence but posthumously condemning Bavaud to a five-year sentence, arguing that Hitler's life was protected by law just as any other life. A second verdict of 1956 reverted the prison sentence and Germany paid Bavaud's family the sum of CHF 40,000 in reparation. In 1976, Rolf Hochhuth idealized Bavaud as a \\"new William Tell\\", while in 1980 Klaus Urner relativized Hochhuth's heroic picture, analyzing psychological aspects of Bavaud's motivation. In 1989 and again in 1998, the Swiss Federal Council admitted that the Swiss authorities did not make a sufficient effort to save Bavaud. Finally, in 2008, the Swiss government honored the life and effort of Bavaud.'Swiss honor a student who tried to kill Hitler,' Herald Tribune (November 7, 2008). In 2011, a small monument was erected in Hauterive near Neuch√¢tel.

Liu Zhang favoured Jian Yong. Later, when war broke out between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang, and Liu Bei had gained the upper hand against his rival and had besieged Yi Province's capital Chengdu, Jian Yong was sent to persuade Liu Zhang to give up resistance. Liu Zhang agreed, and, with Jian Yong by his side, he rode out of the city in a chariot to surrender.

Once, there was a drought in Yi Province and a law prohibiting alcohol went into effect. People who brewed alcoholic drinks would be punished. Over- zealous officials seized brewing utensils from families and suggested to punish the owners of the utensils as if the owners were as guilty as brewers. When Jian Yong and Liu Bei was inspecting the land, they saw a couple walking past, and Jian said to his lord, \\"They're planning to commit an indecent act. Why not arrest them?\\" Liu Bei asked, \\"How do you know?\\" Jian Yong replied, \\"They're equipped with the tools to do so, just as the owners of brewing utensils have the tools to brew alcoholic drinks.\\" Liu Bei laughed and pardoned the families who owned brewing utensils.

Gumperz was, for most of his career, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. His research on the languages of India, on code-switching in Norway, and on conversational interaction, has benefitted the study of sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, linguistic anthropology, and urban anthropology. Career and work Gumperz was born Hans-Josef Gumperz in Hattingen, Germany. A Jew, he fled Nazi Germany and settled first in Italy, then the Netherlands, and finally in the United States in 1939.Libby Rainey, ‚ÄúEmeritus of anthropology and lover of language John Gumperz dies at 91,‚Äù The Daily Californian, April 3, 2013 Originally interested in chemistry, he became fascinated by language. At the University of Michigan he wrote a dissertation entitled The Swabian Dialect of Washtenaw County, Michigan under the direction of Herbert Penzl and earned a Ph.D. in 1954. In 1956 Gumperz joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. There, he developed a new way of looking at sociolinguistics with Dell Hymes, also a scholar of sociolinguistics. Their contribution was a new method called the \\"ethnography of communication.\\" Gumperz's own approach has been called interactional sociolinguistics. Sociolinguistics analyzes variation in discourse within a particular speech community, and it studies how that variation affects the unfolding of meaning in interaction and correlates with the social order of the community. Gumperz built on Hymes's work by looking at differential power between speech communities. In particular, Gumperz noted that the \\"standard\\" form of any given language (the form that is expected in formal situations, such as on the news) is the dialect of those who are already powerful. He called that the \\"prestige dialect,\\" and he noted that those who did not speak that dialect natively but instead a stigmatized or less powerful native dialect were \\"diglossic\\" (they were fluent in their native dialects and also able to use the prestige dialect). However, those whose native dialect was the prestige dialect were rarely able to use other codes. Gumperz defines the speech community as \\"any human aggregate characterized by regular and frequent interaction by means of a shared body of verbal signs and set off from similar aggregates by significant differences in language usage.\\"Dil, A. (ed.). (1971, p. 114). Language in Social Groups. Stanford: Stanford U.P. Gumperz was interested in how the order of situations and the culture of the interlocutors both affect how interlocutors make conversational inferences and interpret verbal or non- verbal signs, which he called contextualization cues (overlapping terms by other scholars include paralanguage and kinesics). His publications and courses given include work in the emerging field of sociolinguistics research in India.

Legend Agricola was a Christian citizen of Bologna who converted his slave, Vitalis, to Christianity; they became deeply attached to each other. Vitalis was first to suffer martyrdom, being executed in the amphitheatre. The authorities then tortured Agricola, but failed to make him give up his religion. He was finally crucified. Veneration The sarcophagus of Saint Agricola. Information about Vitalis and Agricola is based on the writings of Saint Ambrose.Santi Vitale e Agricola In 392 or 393, Eusebius, bishop of Bologna, had announced the discovery of the relics of Vitalis and Agricola in a Jewish cemetery in the city. He reburied the relics according to Christian rites, an event at which Ambrose attended. The reburial led to popular veneration of these saints. The cult of these two martyrs was diffused in Western Europe due to the efforts of Ambrose, who transferred some of the relics to Milan and gave some to Florence. He took some of the blood, parts of the cross, and the nails to Florence, placing these relics in the church erected by a woman named Juliana. On this occasion he delivered an oration in praise of virginity, with special reference to the three virgin daughters of Juliana. His mention of the martyrs Agricola and Vitalis in the first part of the oration is the only source of information on these martyrs' lives (\\"De exhortatione virginitatis\\", cc. i-u, in P.L., XVI, 335). In 396 other relics were sent to St. Victricus, Bishop of Rouen, and about the same date to St. Paulinus of Nola and others. The cult had as its center the city of Bologna, where a basilica was built to hold the relics. The Bolognese church of San Vitale ed Agricola in Arena, part of the complex of 7 churches known as Santo Stefano, is purported to have been built over the remains of a Roman amphitheatre where the martyrdom of Vitalis and Agricola took place in the 4th century.

It was demolished as part of the Perth City Link project in late 2011, with its replacement, Perth Arena, opening the following year. History The venue was conceived and championed by the late Brian Treasure, then General Manager at Perth television station TVW 7 and theatrical entrepreneur Michael Edgley. Their interest was principally that their two organisations had mounted large stage shows which toured the country in circus tents; a process that created major logistical challenges. The venue was designed by architects Hobbs, Winning and Leighton and was forecast to cost $5 million, but its construction coincided with a period of intense industrial action. Delays and interruptions, including strike action which was timed to coincide with concrete pours, led to a cost blow-out. The final cost was $8.3 million and interest charges put immediate financial pressure on the venture. State Records Office: A guide to cabinet papers of 1976 Accessed 7 June 2008 The venue opened on 27 December 1974 as the Channel 7 Edgley Entertainment Centre with the Australian debut of the second Disney On Parade show. In around 1975 the owners approached the State and Federal governments for assistance and the Government of Western Australia took ownership of the building, renaming it The Perth Entertainment Centre. With a capacity of 8003 seats, the Entertainment Centre was Perth's primary large concert venue from 1974 until its closure in 2002. It was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest purpose built regular theatre (containing a proscenium arch) in the world.Save the Perth Entertainment Centre from the Bulldozers . Retrieved 20 July 2006. The venue also played host to a number of theatrical extravaganzas, as well as a range of other events including musicals, circuses, corporate functions and international beauty pageants (Miss Universe 1979). The Entertainment Centre was home to NBL team Perth Wildcats from 1990 until 2002. It was also home to the Perth Breakers of the WNBL from 1992 to 1995. At the front of the Perth Entertainment Centre (west side) was \\"The Academy Twin Cinemas\\" which opened on 17 January 1975. The name changed to \\"Academy West End Alternative Cinemas\\" in June 1986. The name changed again to \\"Lumiere Cinema\\" in 1989. The \\"Lumiere Cinema\\" closed on 28 June 1996. The theatre remained empty, and was demolished along with the Perth Entertainment Centre.Lumiere Cinema. Accessed 19 March 2018 Concerts Demolition The venue was owned by the Seven Network and was officially closed in August 2002. In 2005, the Government of Western Australia unveiled plans for a new entertainment centre to be built on the site of the carpark for the existing centre. In 2006, the new centre was officially given the name of Perth Arena.Home of the new Perth Arena . Demolition of the disused venue began on 11 May 2011 and was completed in December 2011, in preparation for the State Government's Perth City Link project and included tentative approvals for new residential and business towers on the site.

Nicknamed \\"The Axe\\",Hainsworth, \\"Simon Atkins\\", Football Record, 6/7 July 1991, p. 7. Atkins and his twin brother Paul were recruited from Wynyard Football Club in Tasmania and Atkins made his senior VFL debut in Round Two, 1987, against the Sydney Swans at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), gathering three possessions in a 108-point loss to Sydney. After only three matches in 1987 and none in 1988, Atkins became a key player at Footscray in 1989, playing 21 matches before his best season in 1990, when Atkins topped the competition in handballs. Atkins played most of his football as a centreman, complementing a strong midfield that also comprised the Brownlow Medallists Scott Wynd and Tony Liberatore. This successful combination was one of the reasons that Footscray made it to the preliminary final in 1992 after having a season that took most experts by surprise (remembering that the club almost disappeared at the end of the 1989 season). Atkins is best remembered as a consistent winner of the ball who had a great capacity to feed the ball out to team mates from tight situations with \\"quick hands\\". His best seasons were in 1991 and 1992. When Alan Joyce took over from Terry Wheeler at the end of round two in 1994, it soon became clear that Atkins was not an automatic selection for a midfield role, and he was traded to Fitzroy at the end of that season. Holmesby and Main describe Atkins as \\"one of the side's best in its last two seasons\\" (talking about Fitzroy), and \\"at his peak ... he was one of the most productive midfielders in the competition\\". Another attribute he is remembered for is the ability to kick goals from one quick step at the 50-metre mark. His return of 76 goals in 127 games with the Bulldogs is a very good one for a centreman. He was also the last person to kick a goal for Fitzroy in the AFL. Atkins played a role as a special comments man during the ABC's Victorian Football League coverage in the late 2000s. After retiring as a player, Atkins coached Werribee in the Victorian Football League between 2005 and 2010. In 2013 he will be an assistant coach for St Bernards Old Collegians in the Victorian Amateur Football Association.

The Pepsi Chart show carried an emphasis in fun and was the UK's first personality-led chart show: the presenter was live and exciting, big-prize competitions were held, and the Top 10 was official - i.e. it was entirely sales-based resulting in a shared song order with the BBC's Radio 1 Official Chart Show and also theoretically played out at the same time. The Pepsi Chart was produced for CRCA by Unique Productions who along with the (then) programme director of Capital Radio Richard Park, and Fox, came up with the new show concept. The show was broadcast on between 80 and 110 local commercial radio stations across the UK via SMS satellite. Locums for the 'Doctor' included Capital's own Steve Penk and Key 103 Manchester's Darren Proctor. Occasional guest presenters filled in, such as Richard Blackwood of MTV UK & Ireland fame. Compilation Different compilation methods of the chart show were employed in its time. Initially, the sales: airplay ratio for its 40-11 positions were 30:70, but later became 50:50. Sales data was provided by Chart Information Network (CIN - now known as The Official UK Charts Company) and airplay data from Music Control. The final chart show on the Sunday before the new year would air with a chart of the year, counting down the Top 40 most popular singles of that particular year. An exception took place in December 1999, the last countdown of the millennium, when the Top 40 of all time was compiled and aired instead. Elton John's Candle in the Wind came out as top. Various logos used during its time on air Show format Over the years of the show's broadcast, little variation in the format was applied. A typical 3-hour show was aired live between 4pm and 7pm each Sunday, and consisted of the standard 40-1 singles countdown with the inclusion of recaps after every 10 songs. Competition announcements, live calls from contestants, interviews with the artists making that particular week's chart, and advertisements made up the remaining airtime. Criticism from chart purists and fans of the rival Radio 1 Official Top 40 show naturally included comment on the show's 40-11 compilation methods, regular advert slots interrupting the show, and the presenter talking over the starts and ends of music tracks in order to fit the show within the 3 hours. However, this presentation style was typical practice in commercial radio, anyway, and would have been no different from any other show featured on each of the participating stations. With the fun element in place, it was not unusual for the show to go \\"on the road\\" and broadcast live, backstage, from music events. The Smash Hits Poll Winners Party and Capital FM's own Party in the Park concerts were recurring occasions of popularity with the show. Artist involvement As well as standard reaction interviews with chart-toppers, artists were often asked by Fox to \\"introduce the number one to the country\\". At other times, over the course of the show, artists may be asked to phone in to the studio at intervals to \\"pester\\" Fox into revealing the number one track way before even the Top 10 had begun being counted down. At these scripted points, Fox would insist that they'd have to wait to the end, just as with the rest of the listeners. Artists managing to cling on to the top spot for a total of four weeks would be awarded a Pepsi Chart blue disc. Although not made entirely clear to the listeners what exactly this blue disc was, its appearance was similar to those presented in Silver and Gold Record awards. Station participation Requirements for a radio station taking the show were that the station's coverage area was mostly in a \\"white- space\\", i.e. broadcasting to an audience not already covered by a rival participant. There were the odd exceptions to the rule, most notably when existing stations agreed for a new station to carry the show. Other requirements were that the station was a current CRCA member, and the ability to fulfill the obligation of playing a pre-determined number of show promos over the week during primetime to a specific number of the target 15-24 audience. As well as taking the Sunday afternoon show, stations were requested to air the 5-minute chart checkups as part of their usual programming on Monday and Wednesday evenings. Non-live audio clips were delivered via SMS and so stations were expected to have the facility and equipment already in place. Brand Following the success of the radio show, the Pepsi Chart Show was brought to TV screens on Channel 5 as a rival to the BBC's Top of the Pops weekly music programme. Filming initially took place at the Hanover Grand venue near to London's Regent Street, with Rhona Mitra and Eddy Temple-Morris as presenters. Over time, the show moved on to the Sound venue in nearby Leicester Square, with Fox himself at the helm. Abbie Eastwood and Matt Brown eventually took over to become the final presenters of the show. Despite being one of the most-watched shows on Channel 5, the TV show never really made much of an impact on the music television audience share, with likely blames being a combination of both restrictions in the analogue terrestrial transmission coverage of Channel 5 at the time, and occasionally a failure in attracting appearances from the bigger-name pop acts, (There were notably more live performances from the more 'alternative' acts, and as a result, the TV show sometimes did not fully reflect the music in the radio version of the Pepsi Chart, which was more biased towards commercial radio airplay's hit music). Named \\"Doctor Fox's Chart Update\\" in the TV listings, a Pepsi Chart branded spin-off was also aired as a 5-minute slot on Monday evenings, providing a recap of the previous Sunday night's Top 10. Live performances at the Sound nightclub were also used in Pepsi Chart TV shows overseas, combining these English language performances with local ones in countries such as Hungary, Poland, Mexico, Latin America (La Cartelera Pepsi) Russia, Thailand and Australia. The late Caroline Flack was the international presenter for several countries including Norway and Tahiti. Nevertheless, the Pepsi Chart brand had remained strong, helped along by its continued use in exclusive promotional CDs and autoscan radios that were offered to consumers of Pepsi and 7-Up soft drinks. Commercial compilation albums featuring artists from the chart were also produced for the mainstream music market, and frequently boasted chart- topping positions in the compilations category. Other than music CDs, annuals, board games and music quiz DVDs also found their way into high street stores. The Pepsi Chart brand had also managed to spread to other parts of the world, including countries such as The Netherlands, Ireland and Thailand. Sponsorship Pepsi took over as sponsors of The Network Chart Show in August 1993 from Nescafe, with a complete overhaul of the original show's format. After 9 successful years, in late 2002, Pepsi announced the termination of their sponsorship of the show. In January 2003, the show became Hit40UK, and coincided with launch of the ill-fated rival chart show: the Smash Hits! Chart. On 14 June 2009, Hit40UK became The Big Top 40 Show, powered by iTunes.

Edward Heitmann was born in California Gully, Bendigo, Victoria on 3 June 1878. The son of carpenter and blacksmith Herman Heitmann and Katherine n√©e Roberts, he was educated locally. He became a miner at an early age, eventually graduating to shaftsman before qualifying as a mine engine driver. In 1895 he moved to Western Australia but by the following year he had returned to Victoria, where took courses at the Bendigo School of Mines and Industries. On 29 June 1896 he married Emma Jane Johns; they would have a son and two daughters before her death in 1905. In 1909 he married Ada Maude Cooke, with whom he would have two sons and a daughter. In 1899, Heitmann returned to Western Australia to work on the Murchison goldfields. He became increasingly involved in the Labor movement, becoming president of the Day Dawn Engine Drivers' Association, and organising secretary of the Australian Workers' Union. On 24 June 1904 he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Cue on a Labor ticket. He held the seat until 4 November 1913, resigning it to contest the seat of Geraldton in a by-election. Although he did not win the seat of Geraldton on this occasion, he had only eleven months to wait before winning the seat in the general election of 21 October 1914. During his time as Member for Geraldton, Heitman was a member of the Western Australian Health Commission inquiring into Miners Phthisis, and he contributed to the establishment of a tuberculosis sanatorium at Wooroloo. Until 1917 he was one of the Scaddan government's main backbench critics, especially with regards to the 1916 Nevanas affair. In January 1917, he and Rufus Underwood attended a conference in Melbourne which aimed to merge Billy Hughes' National Labor Party with Joseph Cook's liberals. On 20 March, he resigned his Legislative Assembly seat in order to contest an Australian House of Representatives seat as a Nationalist. Shortly afterwards, the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party followed its federal counterpart's lead in expelling its pro-conscription members, including Heitmann. On 5 May 1917, Heitmann was elected to the Australian House of Representatives seat of Kalgoorlie. During the next two years he was in charge of transport arrangements for the demobilisation of the Australian Imperial Force. He was defeated in the federal election of 13 December 1919, and thereafter spent some time in Adelaide working in advertising. By 1921 he was farming at Laanecoorie, Victoria, and the following year contested the Victorian seat of Eaglehawk without success. In 1927 he returned to Bendigo, spending eighteen months as organisation secretary for the Advance Bendigo and the North League. In later life he suffered often from poor health, spending some time in the military hospital at Caulfield. He died at Bendigo on 30 January 1934, and was buried at Bendigo Cemetery. One of his nephews, Jack Heitman, was later a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council from 1963 until his death in 1977.

MikroMikko was Nokia Data's attempt to enter the business computer market. They were especially designed for good ergonomy. History The first model in the line, MikroMikko 1, was released on 29 September 1981, 48 days after IBM introduced its Personal Computer. The launch date of MikroMikko 1 is the name day of Mikko in the Finnish almanac. The MikroMikko line was manufactured in a factory in the Kilo district of Espoo, Finland, where computers had been produced since the 1960s. Nokia later bought the computer division of the Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson. During Finland's economic depression in the early 1990s, Nokia streamlined many of its operations and sold many of its less profitable divisions to concentrate on its key competence of telecommunications. Nokia's personal computer division was sold to the British computer company ICL (International Computers Limited) in 1991, which later became part of Fujitsu. However, ICL and later Fujitsu retained the MikroMikko trademark in Finland. Internationally the MikroMikko line was marketed by Fujitsu under the trademark ErgoPro. Fujitsu later transferred its personal computer operations to Fujitsu Siemens Computers, which shut down its only factory in Espoo at the end of March 2000, thus ending large-scale PC manufacturing in the country.

It was developed by Jez San under his company name Argonaut Software. The game is a fast- moving, first-person combat flight simulator, rendered with colourful wireframe vector graphics inspired by San's love of the 1983 Atari coin-op Star Wars. Starglider was originally developed for the 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST. Rainbird commissioned Realtime Games to produce 8-bit versions for the Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, and ZX Spectrum (128K, with a cut-down 48K version without sampled speech or special missions), and for the IBM PC compatible with CGA. Solid Images were commissioned to produce versions for the Commodore 64 and Apple IIGS. It was followed in 1988 by a sequel, Starglider 2, which uses filled-polygon graphics. The series inspired Argonaut to partner with Nintendo in creating the Super FX chip for Super NES in order to power the StarFox series of hit games.  Story  The game takes over the surface of the occupied planet Novenia, and it is the player's goal to rid the world of the mechanised Egron invaders. ST/Amiga title screen Starglider was packaged with a sci-fi novella by James Follett, describing the game's background story, in which the Egrons effortlessly blitz Novenia despite the planet possessing a previously impenetrable network of utterly deadly defense satellites. The Egrons defeat the system by disguising their battleships as a flock of intergalactic migratory birds, the Stargliders. The defense satellites had been programmed not to fire on these birds (which migrated between planets regularly) and hence did not recognise the Egron battleships as enemies, allowing the Egrons to reach the surface unopposed. The player pilots the only existing example of a prototype fighter craft, initially armed only with lasers, as the TV-guided missiles require an enormous amount of energy to launch and control, which can only be gained by induction as the craft skims over areas with high-tension power conduits. Audio Most versions contain sampled speech from Rainbird employee Clare Edgeley. The Amiga version has title music by Dave Lowe using digitized samples as instrument sounds, predating tracker music. The Atari ST and Amiga versions also have about 15-second long song--a single PCM sound file--with real vocals and synthesizers. A male voice sings: \\"Starglider ... from Rainbird\\". Reception Starglider was Firebird's third best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. COMPUTE! called it \\"a visually smooth concoction that is so realistic in its feel that you'll duck and squirm in your seat\\", especially praising the Atari ST version's graphics and sound. The game won the award for Game Of The Year 1986 in Crash. Legacy A prototype version of Starglider, codenamed NESGlider, was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System utilizing a similar method to accelerate graphics as the future Super FX chip for the SNES would. Argonaut showed the prototype to Nintendo in 1990 but were advised to instead develop the game for the as yet unreleased Super Famicom. They ported the demo to the Super Famicom prototype which took approximately one week. The game was never released but spawned a sequel, Starglider 2. The series inspired Argonaut Software to partner with Nintendo in creating the Super FX enhancement chip for Super NES in order to enable the StarFox series.

Usually translated as 'village' and sometimes as 'hamlet', they are a subdivision of a tambon (subdistrict). , there were 74,944 administrative mubans in Thailand. As of the 1990 census, the average village consisted of 144 households or 746 persons.  Nomenclature  Muban may function as one word, in the sense of a hamlet or village, and as such may be shortened to ban. Mu ban may also function as two words, i.e., ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡πà 'group' (of) ‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô 'homes'. * Mu, in the sense of group (of homes in a tambon), are assigned numbers in the sequence in which each is entered in a register maintained in the district or branch-district office. * Ban, in the sense of home or household for members of each group, are assigned a number (; ) in the sequence in which each is added to the household register also maintained in the district or branch-district office. Each ban is registered in the name of a householder (; ). Assigned ban and mu numbers, together with the names of tambon, district, and province, are used as geographic addresses by government agencies; Thailand Post adds a postal code. Village or ban names do not usually form part of such official addresses. * Ban in the sense of Village occurs in geopolitical toponyms on maps and Thai highway network signage, but these are not administrative subdivisions. Such village names may apply to an isolated muban, but typically apply to a group of adjoining ones, which often have been subdivided from the original settlement. Each new mu is assigned a new number, in the sequence in which it is registered; existing homes or ban in newly numbered mu are assigned new numbers starting with one. The village name of the original settlement is usually retained for the larger grouping. Such village names are not part of a household address, unless Ban is retained as part of the toponym when such a settlement is upgraded‚Äîe.g., a household in Ban Dan would be addressed as Ban No.__ Mu No.__, Ban Dan Sub-district, Ban Dan District, Buriram; or #/# T[ambon] Ban Dan, A[mphoe] Ban Dan, Buriram 31000. :Note: Usage of the short form number/number for ban/mu is both unofficial and unambiguous in a tambon, but in city districts is restricted to subdivision of an original household registration into additional household registrations.  Administration  A village chief (phu yai ban) office in tambon Ban Po, Bang Pa-in District, Ayutthaya Province Each such mu or group is led by a headman, usually called village headman or village chief (; ), who is elected by the population of the village and then appointed by the Ministry of the Interior. The headman has two assistants, one for governmental affairs and one for security affairs. There also may be a village committee with elected members from the village, serving as an advisory body of a village. Originally the village headman, once elected, was in office until reaching retirement age. They now only serve for a five-year term but can then apply for reelection. The same is true for the office of kamnan () or 'sub-district headman' at the next higher tambon (sub-district) level. Communities (‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏ô) or neighborhoods that are part of a town or city (thesaban mueang and thesaban nakhon) have no equivalent to village headmen, but may be organized into community associations having advisory committees.

His significance in the history of Spain lies in the fact that during his episcopate the church of Castile and Le√≥n emerges from its isolation. He was born in Gascony around 1050, at La Sauvetat de Blanquefort (Lot-et-Garonne), near the town of Agen. It is thought he belonged to the ancient family of the viscounts of S√©dirac (also spelled S√©dilhac), whose castle, southwest of La Sauvetat, still stands. An illness forced Bernard to turn away from a military career and instead enter the monastic life.Paul N. Morris, Roasting the Pig: A Vision of Cluny, Cockaigne and the Treatise of Garcia of Toledo (Dissertation.com, 2007), 67. He became a monk in the Abbey of Cluny, whence he was sent to Spain with others to assist the cause of the reforms of Gregory VII. Here he was made (1080) abbot of St. Facundus at Sahag√∫n in the diocese of Le√≥n, and finally named for the archbishopric of Toledo by Alfonso VI of Castile, the great patron of Cluny. Gregory's plans for Spain included (besides a general crusade against clerical marriage, simony, and lay investiture) the substitution of the Roman liturgy for the Mozarabic and pressure for recognition of obligations of tribute from the Spanish church. The former point had been practically gained before his death, in spite of strenuous opposition. Urban II, by raising Bernard's see to primatial dignity, gave him the power necessary to prosecute the work of Romanizing. His cooperation made possible Urban's intervention at the Synod of Le√≥n (1091) and ignoring of the royal right of investiture when Alfonso attempted to appoint a Castilian to the see of Santiago de Compostela, apparently in order to counterbalance the influence of the Cluniac Benedictines with whom the archbishop was filling the episcopal sees.

Some reminiscences of his youthful days as a knight appear in his forcible seizure of the mosque at Toledo in his first year as archbishop and in his plans for a crusade against the Saracens of the East, which both Urban II and Paschal II forbade in view of the tasks which Spanish Christian knighthood faced at home. This around two-millenniums existent military stronghold, at the Spanish City of Sig√ºenza was reformed and improved by French born bishop of Sig√ºenza Bernard de Sedirac, a.k.a.

Before the 1990 unification of the Federal Republic of Germany (or West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (or East Germany), Catholics were 42% of the population of West Germany. What makes it easier to know religious statistics in Germany is that Christian taxpayers must declare their religious affiliation as church tax is deducted by the state to be passed on to the relevant church in the state where the taxpayer lives. Apart from its demographic weight, the Catholic Church in Germany has an old religious and cultural heritage, which reaches back to both Saint Boniface, \\"apostle of Germany\\" and first archbishop of Mainz, and to Charlemagne, buried at Aachen Cathedral. Notable religious sites include Ettal Abbey, Maria Laach Abbey, and Oberammergau which is famous for its performance of the Passion Play every ten years. The Catholic Church in Germany also boasts one of the most recognizable landmarks in all of the country, the Cologne Cathedral. Other notable Catholic cathedrals are in Freising, Mainz (St. Martin's Cathedral), Fulda, Paderborn, Hildesheim, Regensburg, Frankfurt, Speyer, Munich (Frauenkirche), Worms, Berlin (St. Hedwig's Cathedral, with crypt of Bernhard Lichtenberg), Bamberg, and Trier.Annuario Pontificio 2008 en presentert History of Catholicism in Germany Christianization of the Germans The earliest stage of Christianization of the various Celtic people and Germanic people occurred only in the western part of Germany, the part controlled by the Roman empire. Christianization was facilitated by the prestige of the Christian Roman Empire amongst its pagan subjects and was achieved gradually by various means. The rise of Germanic Christianity was at times voluntary, particularly among groups associated with the Roman Empire. Aspects of primeval pagan religion have persisted to this day, including the names of the days of the week. As Roman rule crumbled in Germany in the 5th century, this phase of Catholicism in Germany came to an end with it. At first, the Gallo-Roman or Germano-Roman populations were able to retain control over big cities such as Cologne and Trier, but in 459 these too were overwhelmed by the attacks of Frankish tribes. Most of the Gallo-Romans or Germano-Romans were killed or exiled.Kurt Hoppst√§dter and HansWalter Herrmann (Publishers, Geschichtliche Landeskunde des Saarlandes, Book 2: Von der fr√§nkischen Landnahme bis zum Ausbruch der franz√∂sischen Revolution. Selbstverlag des Historischen Vereins f√ºr die Saargegend e. V., Saarbr√ºcken 1977, Pg 17/18 The newcomers to the towns reestablished the observance of the pagan rites.Kurt Hoppst√§dter and HansWalter Herrmann (Publishers, Geschichtliche Landeskunde des Saarlandes, Book 2: Von der fr√§nkischen Landnahme bis zum Ausbruch der franz√∂sischen Revolution. Selbstverlag des Historischen Vereins f√ºr die Saargegend e. V., Saarbr√ºcken 1977, Pg 25 The small remaining Catholic population was powerless to protect its faith against the new ruling Frankish lords. But as soon as 496, Frankish King Clovis I was baptized together with many members of his household. In contrast to the eastern German tribes, who became Arian Christians, he became a Catholic. Following the example of their king, many Franks were baptized too, but their Catholicism was intermixed with pagan rites. Over the next eight centuries, Irish, Scottish, and English missionaries reintroduced Christianity into the German territories. During the period of the Frankish Empire, the two most important of these missionaries were Columbanus, who was active in the Frankish Empire from 590, and St. Boniface, who was active from 716. The missionaries, particularly the Scottish Benedictines, founded monasteries (Schottenkl√∂ster, Scottish monasteries) in Germany, which were later combined into a single congregation governed by the Abbot of the Scots monastery at Regensburg. The conversion of the Germanic peoples began with the conversion of the Germanic nobility, who were expected to impose their new faith on the general population. This expectation was consistent with the sacral position of the king in Germanic paganism: the king is charged with interacting with the divine on behalf of his people. Hence the general population saw nothing wrong with their kings choosing their preferred mode of worship. The favoured method of showing the supremacy of the Christian belief was the destruction of the holy trees of the Germans. These were trees, usually old oaks or elm trees, dedicated to the gods. Because the missionary was able to fell the tree without being slain by the god, his Christian god had to be stronger. The pagan sacrifices, known as bl√≥t, had been seasonal celebrations where gifts were offered to appropriate gods and attempts were made to forecast what the coming season would be like. Similar events had sometimes been convened in times of crisis, for much the same reasons.See Viga-Glum‚Äôs Saga (Ch.26), Hakon the Good‚Äôs Saga (Ch.16), Egil‚Äôs Saga (Ch. 65), etc. The sacrifices, consisting of gold, weapons, animals, and even human beings, were hung on the branches of a holy tree. The Hiberno-Scottish mission ended in the 13th century. Supported by native Christians, they succeeded in Christianizing all of Germany. Catholicism as the official religion of the Holy Roman Empire Ecclesiastical provinces and episcopal sees in Central Europe 1500 In medieval times, Catholicism was the only official religion within the Holy Roman Empire. (There were resident Jews, but they were not considered citizens of the empire.) Within the empire the Catholic Church was a major power. Large parts of the territory were ruled by ecclesiastical lords. Three of the seven seats in the council of electors of the Holy Roman Emperors were occupied by Catholic archbishops: the Arch-chancellor of Burgundy (archbishop of Trier), the Arch-chancellor of Italy (archbishop of Cologne), and the Arch-chancellor of Germany (archbishop of Mainz). The Holy Roman Emperor could only become such through coronation by the Pope. The Protestant Reformation Burghers and monarchs were united in their frustration at the Catholic Church not paying any taxes to secular states while itself collecting taxes from subjects and sending the revenues disproportionately to Italy. Martin Luther denounced the Pope for involvement in politics. Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms justified the confiscation of church property and the crushing of the Great Peasant Revolt of 1525 by the German nobles. This explains the attraction of some territorial princes to Lutheranism. Along with confiscated Catholic church property, ecclesiastical (Catholic) dominions became the personal property of the holder of the formerly religious office, for the right to rule was attached to this office. On 25 September 1555, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and the forces of the Schmalkaldic League signed the Peace of Augsburg to officially end the religious wars between the Catholics and the Protestants. This treaty legalized the partitioning of the Holy Roman Empire into Catholic and Protestant territories. Under the treaty, the religion of the ruler (either Lutheranism or Catholicism) determined the religion of his subjects. This policy is widely referred to by the Latin phrase, cuius regio, eius religio (\\"whose reign, his religion\\", or \\"in the prince's land, the prince's religion\\"). Families were given a period in which they were free to emigrate to regions where their desired religion prevailed. The religious intolerance and tensions within the Holy Roman Empire were one of the reasons for the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which devastated most of Germany and killed eight million people, many of those within the Empire dying from disease and famine. Secularization of church states in the aftermath of the French Revolution In the war of the First Coalition, revolutionary France defeated the coalition of Prussia, Austria, Spain, and Britain. One result was the cession of the Rhineland to France by the Treaty of Basel in 1795. Six years later, the Concordat of 1801, an agreement between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII, was signed on 15 July 1801. Another two years later, in 1803, to compensate the princes of the annexed territories, a set of mediatizations was carried out, which brought about a major redistribution of territorial sovereignty within the Empire. At that time, large parts of Germany were still ruled by Catholic bishops (95.000 km¬≤ with more than three million inhabitants). In the mediatizations, the ecclesiastical states were by and large annexed to neighbouring secular principalities. Only three survived as theocracies: the Archbishopric of Regensburg, which was raised from a bishopric with the incorporation of the Archbishopric of Mainz, and the lands of the Teutonic Knights and Knights of Saint John. Monasteries and abbeys lost their means of existence as they had to abandon their lands. Paradoxically, the losses in church land and property made the national or local churches in Germany (as well as in the former Holy Roman Empire, France, Switzerland, and Austria) more dependent on Rome (ultramontane). This shift in the 1850s was sustained by a more zealous clergy, the revival of old teaching orders, the emergence of Marian confraternities, new religious congregations of men and women, and the holding of popular missions.David Blackbourn, Marpingen: Apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Nineteenth-Century Germany (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1994), 29.Jonathan Sperber, Popular Catholicism in Nineteenth-Century Germany (Princeton, NJ: Princeton, 1984) Kulturkampf Munich Frauenkirche. Cathedral of the Archbishop of Munich and Freising. In the mid-19th century, the Catholic Church was also seen as a political power, even in Protestant Prussia, exerting a strong influence on many parts of life. However, from the Catholics' point of view (especially where Catholics were the majority as in the Rhineland Province, the Saar, Alsace and Loraine, and Silesia), Catholics often felt intimidated by self-consciously Protestant rulers, especially when an anti-Catholic campaign was carried on at many levels and would involve \\"the banishing of priests and nuns from the country, the driving of bishops from their chairs, the closing of schools, the confiscation of church property, the disruption of church gatherings, the disbanding of Catholic associations, and an open feud with the Vatican.James Carroll, CONSTANTINE'S SWORD (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2001), p. 486. Chancellor Bismarck regarded the Church as a threat, especially in view of its defense of the discriminated Polish minority. Laws enacted in the state of Prussia and in the empire in the early 1870s discriminated against Catholics. These laws were resisted by the Church, leading to heated public debates in the media and in the parliaments, during which the term \\"Kulturkampf\\" gained widespread currency. Diplomatic ties with the Vatican were cut and additional laws were passed to quell Catholic opposition. This only resulted in more support by the Catholic population and more resistance by the Church. During the Kulturkampf, four bishops and 185 priests in defiance of the laws were tried and imprisoned and many more were fined or went into exile. After the death of Pius IX in 1878, Bismarck took up negotiations with more conciliatory Pope Leo XIII who proclaimed the end of the Kulturkampf on 23 May 1887.Grew, Raymond in: \\"Liberty and the Catholic Church in 19th. century Europe\\", Freedom and Religion in the 19th.

Berend in: An Economic History of 19th-century Europe, Cambridge University Press, Rebecca Ayako Bennette, Fighting for the Soul of Germany: The Catholic Struggle for Inclusion after Unification (Harvard U.P. 2012) Catholicism and the Third Reich The Catholic Church denounced Nazism in the years leading up to its rise to power in 1933-34. It believed its primary duty was to protect German Catholics and the Church. Popes Pius XI and Pius XII publicly denounced racism and the murder of innocents. Many Jews were offered baptismal certificates by local parishes and priests in Germany, and some actually converted to escape deportation, arrest or execution, though the Nazi policy of anti-semitism did not exempt \\"converts\\" as their philosophy was based on race as pointed out in its National Socialist Program ‚Äì not on religion. The Vatican knew of the murder of the Jews very early on, as it had religious representatives in all of the occupied countries. Many individual priests, religious and lay Catholics attempted to save Jews in Germany. Adolf Hitler was raised as a Catholic in Austria but no longer practised his faith as an adult and as he rose to power. The Catholic Church was in opposition to other ideologies like Communism, because these ideologies were deemed incompatible with Christian morals. Some German bishops expected their priests to promote the Catholic political Centre Party. The majority of Catholic- sponsored newspapers supported the Centre Party over the Nazi Party. In Munich there were some Catholics, both lay and clerics, who supported Hitler, and, on occasion and contrary to Catholic doctrine, (in the early 1920s) attacked a leading bishop for his defense of Jews.Kevin Spicer Hitler's Priests (DeKalb: University of Northern Illinois Press, 2008), 30Spicer, Resisting the Third Reich, 29Ludwig Volk, Cardinal von Faulhaber, 1917-1945 Volume I (Mainz, 1975), 305-325.Faulhaber Archives in Archiv des Erzbistums Munchen und Freising Some bishops prohibited Catholics in their dioceses from joining the Nazi Party. This ban was modified after Hitler's 23 March 1933 speech to the Reichstag in which he described Christianity as the foundation for German values. The Nazis did not formally advocate Catholicism but rather an apostate \\"Christian\\" sect known as Positive Christianity that was in direct opposition to Catholic dogma and doctrine. Catholicism in the German Democratic Republic After World War II the Catholics in the zone occupied by the Soviet army found themselves under a militantly atheist government. Many parishes were cut off from their dioceses in the western part of Germany. German Catholicism was comparatively less affected than Protestantism by the establishment of the GDR, as nearly all of the Soviet zone's territory was historically majority Protestant, and only 11% of the people were Catholic. There were only two, small, majority-Catholic regions in the GDR: a part of the Eichsfeld region and the region in the southeast inhabited by Sorbs. The present situation of Catholicism in Germany Members of the Catholic Church in Germany in December 2012 (ecclesiastical provinces) 27.2% of the total population is Catholic (22.6 million people as of December 2019). Only one of Germany's Bundesl√§nder (federal states), the Saarland has a Catholic absolute majority: Catholicism is also the largest religious group in Bavaria, Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The German state supports both the Catholic and Protestant churches; it collects taxes for the churches and there is religious education in the schools, taught by teachers who have to be approved by the churches. Church taxes are \\"automatic paycheck deductions\\" taken from all registered church members, \\"regardless of\\" whether, and if yes, \\"how often members attend services.\\"Niels Sorrells,\\"Luther's spiritual heirs face uncertain future, CHRISTIAN CENTURY, March 20, 2007, 16 Catholicism in Germany today faces several challenges: * Traditionally, there were localities with Catholic majorities and cities of Protestant majorities; however, the mobility of modern society began to mix the population. Interconfessional married couples face the problem of not being able to share the same communion. Because of continuing secularization, most states have neither a Catholic nor a Protestant absolute majority. (In addition to the ones with Catholic majorities mentioned above, the only Protestant absolute majority is found in the northern Schleswig-Holstein, 53.1%.) * Modern society is changing old structures. Exclusively Catholic environments are disintegrating, even in traditional areas like the state of Bavaria where the Catholic majority was lost in the archdiocese of Munich (including the City of Munich and large parts of Upper Bavaria) as recently as in 2010.Erzdi√∂zese M√ºnchen: Nichtkatholiken seit 2010 in der Mehrheit Catholics a minority in Archdioses Munich: source Austrian Catholic Newservice * The number of Catholics who attend Sunday Mass has decreased (from 22% in 1990 to 13% in 2009). Catholic procession in Moosburg, Bavaria, 2005 One of the biggest challenges facing the church is to retain the registered, tax- paying members (regardless of how often they attend services) to fund parishes and church agencies, especially its international relief organizations like Adveniat.See Willkommen zum Adveniat-Blog, Adveniat Media Portal, etc. German Catholics, however, are divided over the issue of a compulsory Church tax. Under the tax an additional 8 percent to 9 percent of personal income tax is deducted at source by the German state from registered churchgoers (of Catholic and Protestant communities). Although the tax provides the Catholic and Lutheran churches with an exact membership count and a net income of 5.6 billion euros (in 2008) which has helped make the German Catholic Church one of the wealthiest in the world. In 2019 it was reported that the Catholic church had a net loss of 216,078 members the previous year. The Protestant churches in Germany had a similar net loss of membership, about 220,000 members left. While church membership is currently at 45 million or 53%, demographers predict that it will fall to 23 million by 2060 based on the current trends. In 2020 it was reported that the Catholic church in Germany had a 402,000 loss in membership, the largest ever single year decrease up to that point. The Protestant churches in Germany also had a large drop in membership of about 440,000.  Child abuse cases  The development gained momentum with numerous cases of child abuse by priests having become public in recent years and in an ongoing process (as of 2020).  2013 increased resignations of registered Catholics and allegations of misappropriation of Franz-Peter Tebartz (\\"Tebartz effect\\")  Corpus Christi procession in Neumarkts, Bavaria, 2016 A spate of nationwide resignations and protest occurred in late 2013 caused by what church officials termed as the 'Tebartz- effect'. Investigations revealed alleged misappropriation of church funds by Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst of Limburg over several years. Nicknamed the \\"Protzbischof\\" (engl. approx. \\"bling-\\", \\"swank-\\" or \\"splurge-Bishop\\") he has attracted growing disapproval for hypocrisy for preaching the virtues of poverty while living extravagantly, such as, travelling first class on humanitarian missions to India with flights costing around ‚Ç¨7,000 each.Muller, U.

However, Limburg's citizens found the building to resemble a \\"Kaaba of Limburg\\", as the colour and its cubical shape resembled the Kaaba of Mecca. The diocese budgeted tightly. It often lacked the funding to afford basic overhead and upkeep of church facilities such as maintenance, and disbanded services such as daycare. The \\"Tebartz effect\\" has also disenfranchised both Protestant and Catholic Christians. In Cologne the Evangelical Church encountered an 80% increase in absences, with 228 de- registrations. Also, 1,250 Bavarians left the church in October 2013, doubling from 602 in September. Throughout Germany the cities of Bremen, Osnabr√ºck, Paderborn, Passau and Regensburg reported three-fold increases of Catholic resignations. Catholic organizations in Germany *Katholische junge Gemeinde (KjG) *Bund der Deutschen Katholischen Jugend (BDKJ) German popes Pope Leo IX was one of eight German popes. Eight popes have been either German or from Germanic tribes. Pope Boniface II, an Ostrogoth, served as the first Germanic pope from 530 to 532. The next German pope was Gregory V (Pope 996-999). The 11th century saw five German popes, including Leo IX who was canonized as a saint. Pope Benedict XVI (resigned in 2013), the former Cardinal Josef Ratzinger, is a German, from Bavaria. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in her 9-page address at the Bavarian Catholic Academy's conference on \\"Political Action based on Christian Responsibility\\", noted that Benedict XVI's encyclical Caritas in Veritate pointed the way forward in the current economic crisis.

Though both monarchs and nobles usually inherit their titles, the mechanisms often differ, even in the same country. The British crown has been heritable by women since the medieval era (in the absence of brothers), while the vast majority of hereditary noble titles granted by British sovereigns are not heritable by daughters. Gender preference Often a hereditary title is inherited only by the legitimate, eldest son of the original grantee or that son's male heir according to masculine primogeniture. In some countries and some families, titles descended to all children of the grantee equally, as well as to all of that grantee's remoter descendants, male and female. This practice was common in the Kalmar Union, and was frequently the case in the Letters Patent issued by King Eric of Pomerania, King Joseph Bonaparte conferred the title \\"Prince of Naples \\" and later \\"Prince of Spain\\" on his children and grandchildren in the male and female line.Adels og V√•penbrev utstedt av danske (unions) konger indtil 1536 (\\"Letters Patents issued by danish (union) kings until 1536\\") published The Society for the advancement of science. Copenhagen 2007 Historically, females have much less frequently been granted noble titles and, still more rarely, hereditary titles. However it was not uncommon for a female to inherit a noble title if she survived all kinsmen descended patrilineally from the original grantee or, in England, if she survived just her own brothers and their male-line descendants. Rarely, a noble title descends to the eldest child regardless of gender (although by law this has become the prevalent form of titular inheritance among the Spanish nobility). A title may occasionally be shared and thus multiplied, in the case of a single title, or divided when the family bears multiple titles. In the French nobility, often the children and other male-line descendants of a lawful noble titleholder self-assumed the same or a lower title of nobility; while not legal, such titles were generally tolerated at court during both the ancien regime and 19th century France as titres de courtoisie. Examples *Hereditary monarchy ‚Äì in Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, Thailand, Tonga, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lesotho, Eswatini, and the Commonwealth realms. Other national constitutions use different modes of succession to their monarchies, e.g. the election of the Pope in the Vatican City, and especially in East Asia often adding an element of selection (e.g. at a family council) among eligible relations of the monarch. Special cases are the two federal monarchies, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, where the constituent states of each federation are hereditary monarchies but those rulers form an electoral college that assigns the federal position of head of state to one of their number for a term (of five years). A similar system existed in the Holy Roman Empire. *Titles of nobility in the United Kingdom (Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron) and other countries (see peerage). In the United Kingdom, most titles of nobility (peerages and the lower title of Baronet) pass only to the eldest son (or in the non ducal Peerage of Scotland to the eldest daughter in the absence of male heirs); all other sons and daughters of peers are commoners though they may use one or more not independently heritable courtesy titles, either Lord, Lady or The Honourable depending on the rank of the peerage held by their father or mother, or another title styled like a peerage but without a seat in the Lords, usually one or two ranks below father's. In many European countries, titles may be inherited by all the heirs -- male and female -- of a family, whose members thus all share the same title at the same time (for instance, within the szlachta nobility of Poland or in the nobilities of the successor states of the Holy Roman Empire). Indeed in Poland a coat of arms could eventually be correctly adopted by marriage to a titled szlachta spouse -- either male or female. In the Far East the main (Chinese-induced) tradition is rather for titles to devalue as the generations succeed each other, but not to the same rank. *Hereditary chieftaincy - manifested in countries in various parts of Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania. Examples range from the politically powerful (such as the Nigerian traditional rulers and the king of the Zulu Nation) to the merely titular (such as the rajas and rais of India and the Arab sheikhs). *Some court titles, e.g. in the United Kingdom, including Earl MarshalEarl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain. Most of these are sinecures, i.e. purely ceremonial. They pass generally to the eldest son (except for that of Lord Great Chamberlain, which is split between the heads of the Cholmondeley and Willoughby families). *Many other ‚Äì especially feudal age ‚Äì offices became inheritable, often connected to military (e.g. keeper of a castle, such as Castellan; in Japan even sh≈çgun) or domanial functions, which is also why some such functions became noble titles (e.g. Burgrave, Margrave). * Certain religious positions, such as the Aga Khan and DƒÅ'ƒ´ al- Mutlaq. Coparcenary Coparcenary is the situation in which two or more people inherit a title equally between them as a result of which none can inherit until all but one have renounced their right to the inheritance. This could arise when a title passes through and vests in female heirs in the absence of a male heir. Before they could inherit, each of the female heirs would be an heir presumptive. After they inherited, since the title could not be held by two people simultaneously, two daughters (without a brother) who inherited in this way would do so as co-parceners. In these circumstances, the title would in fact be held in abeyance until one of them renounced for herself and her successors in favour of the other. In England and Wales, passage of a title in this fashion is effected under the rules laid down in the Law of Property Act 1925.

We know nothing of his early years; after ordination he became chaplain to Duke William the Conqueror's brother, Robert of Mortain (died 1090).

He gave up his canonry in 1095, settled at Dompierre, 19 miles east of Mortain, and became one of the leaders of the hermit colony of the forest of Craon. Here for seventeen years he lived an ascetic life, and was called Vital le Vieux (\\"Vitalis the Old\\") taken from his father's name. At the same time he concerned himself, like his mentor Robert of Arbrissel, with the salvation of the surrounding population, giving practical help to the outcasts who gathered round him.

Today these suburbs are known as the Old East and can boast to have some of the city's most high-end residential properties. The Old East is characterized by established residential suburbs with mature tree lined streets and established gardens.

He represented South Canterbury electorates in Parliament for a total of 34 years, before being appointed to the Legislative Council. He served briefly on the Otago Provincial Council and was Mayor of Oamaru for three years. Early life Steward in ca 1891 Steward was born in Reading, Berkshire, in England in 1841. He was educated at King Edward VI. Grammar School in Ludlow (to which his family had moved, his boyhood home at Numbers 4‚Äì5 King Street now marked by a plaque), and Dr Benham's Commercial School in Gloucester. He emigrated to New Zealand apparently on the Mersey in 1862, but his name is not included in the passenger list for the 25 September 1862 arrival. Family Steward married Hannah Whitefoord on 4 December 1873 at St. Paul's Church in Dunedin. She was the third daughter of Caleb Whitefoord of Burford in Shropshire near Ludlow. They had one son and three daughters. Professional career In 1863, he was working as a draper in Christchurch. From 1867, he was editor of the Oamaru Times in Oamaru. He was later proprietor of the North Otago Times, the Ashburton Mail and Guardian and, after moving to Waimate, the Waimate Times. Political career Member of Parliament Steward and Macassey contested the 1871 general election in Waitaki. At the time, the Waitaki was a single-member electorate. At the nomination meeting, Steward received a slight majority during the show of hands, and Macassey demanded a poll. The poll was held on Friday, 3 February 1871. Steward and Macassey received 188 and 137 votes, respectively. Steward was thus returned to Parliament. The next election was held in early January 1876. Waitaki had become a two-member electorate, and four candidates put their names forward. Steward and Joseph O'Meagher contested the election as abolitionists (i.e. they were in favour of abolishing the provincial government), while Thomas W. Bislop and Samuel Shrimski were provincialists (i.e. they favoured the retention of provincial government). The provincialists won the election by quite some margin, and Steward lost his seat in Parliament. Steward was again elected in 1881 to represent the single- member Waimate electorate. The Waitaki electorate had been abolished and the Waimate electorate covered the area of South Canterbury where Steward resided. Four candidates had contested the election, and Steward was returned with a comfortable margin. He held the electorate until it was abolished in 1893. In 1893 he was re-elected to a reconstituted Waitaki, which he held until 1911, when he was appointed to the Legislative Council. Steward was elected Speaker on 23 January 1891 when the Liberal Government came to power. The 1890 general election was held on 5 December 1890. Harry Atkinson was the Premier at the time. Traditionally, the incumbent speaker would keep his position, unless the election result was not in support of the incoming government. The 1890 election did not have a clear result and the incumbent speaker, Maurice O'Rorke, lost his seat in Parliament. Alfred Saunders, an independent MP, proposed William Rolleston as speaker, as he had been a long-standing MP since 1868. But Richard Seddon proposed that Steward be chosen instead, which came as a surprise, as the latter was relatively undistinguished. The house voted on the issue and Steward was chosen by 36 to 29 votes. It was the first time that the role of speaker had been put to the vote by the New Zealand Parliament. The election sealed the end of the Atkinson government, which resigned the following day. The forming of the Liberal Party marked the beginning of party politics in New Zealand. Steward held the position of speaker until 8 November 1893. He had not been regarded as an effective manager of the House and was succeeded by O'Rorke, who had regained his seat in Parliament. However, Steward was to remain as a Member of Parliament until his retirement in 1911. He was knighted in 1903. Otago Provincial Council Steward was a member of the Otago Provincial Council from 1875 until the abolition of provincial government in 1876. Mayor of Oamaru Steward was Mayor of Oamaru from 1876 to 1879. He succeeded George Sumpter, who was first elected in 1875. The 1876 mayoral election was contested against J. Falconer, and Steward had a majority of 35 votes. In 1877, Steward was returned unopposed. The 1878 election was contested by Steward and George Sumpter, and the former achieved a majority of 45 votes. In the depression year of 1879, Steward did not stand for re-election. Steward was formally thanked at the last council meeting for the able manner in which he had led the council, and the courteous was in which he had interacted with the councillors. During Steward's term, the most significant achievement was the installation of the Oamaru water supply, which resulted in a fall of the death rate from 10.4 per 1000 population to 8.9 per 1000. Steward was succeeded by Samuel Gibbs. Gibbs had previously been mayor from 1867 to 1870 and was elected unopposed. Death and commemoration Steward died in Island Bay, Wellington on 30 October 1912. The body was taken by ferry steamer to Lyttelton, and by train to Waimate. The funeral took place in Waimate. A plaque in the St Augustine Church in Waimate is dedicated to Steward. The Waimate District Council's district plan has a formal protection for a tree that was planted by Steward on 26 June 1911. It is located beside the memorial statue for Dr Margaret Barnett Cruickshank MD.

Owned by the City of Perth, the hall is the main venue of the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, and also hosts a number of other events and performances. The building itself is located in Perth's central business district, adjacent to the Supreme Court Gardens and Government House. The building has two fa√ßades: facing north over St Georges Terrace, and facing south over the Swan River. The concert hall was constructed on land granted to the City of Perth by the Government of Western Australia, and opened on Australia Day (26 January), 1973. Designed by Howlett and Bailey Architects, local architectural firm, the building is constructed in the Brutalist style, making heavy use of white off-form concrete and a solid opaque interior. The main auditorium of the hall seats 1,729 people, as well as a 160-person choir gallery and a 3000-pipe organ. Acoustically, the venue is considered one of the best in Australia, with the design overseen by the New Zealand acoustician Sir Harold Marshall. History Perth Concert Hall south east corner As early as 1950, the City of Perth secured a site between Stirling Gardens and Government House, occupied by the Department of Agriculture and the Australian Broadcasting Commission for the construction of a new town hall. The proposed site provoked vigorous public debate. Some wanted a riverside site, such as the Esplanade or Barrack Square, while others suggested land at the end of Barrack Street, between Stirling and Beaufort Streets, or the central Perth area between William and Barrack streets along Forrest Place. The official opening of the Perth Concert Hall included a midnight to dawn ball attended by almost 1,700 people. The Western Australian Symphony Orchestra was joined by 55 members of the South Australian Symphony Orchestra for the occasion, and the whole event was televised. Headlines of 'A Milestone in the Cultural Life of WA' greeted the opening. Earlier, John Birman, the Director of the Festival of Perth, had been quoted saying, ‚Äò...it is the first concert hall in Australia since the war and has more than local significance...‚Äô. Chronology of development *1950: City of Perth secured land between Stirling Gardens and Government House for the construction of a new town hall. *1955: Contest to design new town hall (offices and auditorium) for City of Perth announced. *1960: Concept but not design of contest prize winners, Howlett and Bailey, purchased by the City of Perth. The concept was for two separate buildings ‚Äì a ten-story administrative building and a circular auditorium. *1962: Only the administrative block (Council House) was built due to financial constraints and concern over the design of the auditorium. *1966: Sir Thomas Wardle sold his Capitol Theatre to the City of Perth to make way for a car park. The Capitol was the main concert venue in Perth and home of the West Australian Symphony Orchestra. *1967: State government and the City of Perth formed a special committee to consider the matter of a concert hall. The committee considered ten sites and decided on the abandoned Chevron-Hilton site as the most appropriate. Lengthy negotiations ensued as the City of Perth wanted a combined town hall and concert hall on the site; the State government was not prepared to provide the land and contribute to this ‚Äì it wanted a concert hall only. *1968: City of Perth settled on the construction of a concert hall only and the State Government offered Chevron-Hilton site, $1,000,000 towards construction of a concert hall and 50% of its operating costs. Architects Jefferey Howlett and Don Bailey appointed to design a concert hall in July. *1969: The Chevron- Hilton site (Lot 853/Reserve 30347) was vested in the City of Perth for the purpose of the concert hall, public restaurant and parking area. Final plans were presented to the City of Perth in January. The total cost of the project was budgeted at $3.1 million. *1970: State Government increased its contribution to the project to $1,350,000 Sabemo awarded the tender of $3,201,873 for construction in April and work on site commenced on 12 June; John Sherwood acted as Project Manager; local companies such as Hollostone Pty Ltd, Midland Brick and Millars Timber provided materials. *1972: Construction completedThe Master builder Perth Concert Hall supplement.

Interior detail of the Perth Concert Hall, showing the stage and pipe organ The Concert Hall displays elements of brutalist architecture The building was designed by Howlett and Bailey Architects. Jeffrey Howlett and Don Bailey had won a design competition for a Town Hall and auditorium in 1961. Their design consisted of two buildings, one containing administrative offices and the other, oval in shape, comprising the 'town hall' or auditorium. The administration offices, called Council House, were built, however financial constraints and doubts regarding the auditorium's acoustic properties meant that construction of the auditorium building was delayed. Its design was subsequently re-considered and it was not until the late-1960s that a different plan was approved. This plan was > ...to accommodate not more than 2,000 people and to cost no more than > $2,000,000 and with the highest priority to be given to its musical uses, > i.e. Symphony concerts, choral concerts, organ recitals, etc., and, in > addition, performances of minimum staged ballet, fold dances or musical > drama, and also be suitable for other functions such as large Civic > receptions, conferences, conventions, public meetings, pageants, school > speech days, pop concerts and folk singers. Gallery level foyer showing post and lintel. Through 1969, the architectural plans were amended several times. These amendments included beautification and landscaping of the main pedestrian approach from St Georges Terrace and construction of a subway under the Terrace, a pit for a 60-piece orchestra with removable flooring and seating to cover the pit when not in use, and improved access and facilities for disabled people. The original plans included a restaurant with a seating capacity for 400, but following inspection of similar halls in the eastern states of Australia, it was decided that this was not warranted. It was, therefore, decided to make the restaurant smaller and include a tavern and cocktail bar, allowing patrons a wider choice. The bar area was named The Wardle Room, after Sir Thomas Wardle. It was the architects' intention that the exhibition foyers would be used as a continually changing venue for all types of art (such as painting, tapestry and sculpture exhibitions) rather than as permanent exhibition spaces. This may have influenced the Perth City Council's indecision over whether or not to accept artist Sydney Nolan's offer to permanently loan the city a series of 64 paintings of wildflowers for hanging in the Hall. After considerable public debate over the matter, Nolan withdrew the offer and art dealers and others criticised the short sighted and parochial attitude of the Council in refusing the offer. Ironically, the first exhibition in the foyers featured 54 of Sydney Nolan's wildflower paintings. Several consultants were involved in the design of the building, including acoustic consultants, structural engineers, and experts in escalators, stage machinery and lighting. D. H. Fraser was responsible for the structural design and Professor A. Harold Marshall was the acoustics consultant, in association with Warwick Mehaffey of the ABC. Dr Marshall used computer modelling to predict how well people would hear in each of the seats and worked closely with the architects in designing the main auditorium, which according to Jefferey Howlett had to be > ...a Great Room, as the Concertgebouw hall in Amsterdam, the Boston Symphony > Hall and the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna are great rooms, recognised for their > superb acoustic and that is not merely clarity...The great halls have ornate > ceilings and other ornamentation. Though the Perth Concert Hall will be a > completely modern building, the \\"fruity\\" ceilings and decorations of the > older halls, which undoubtedly play a part in their acoustics, will be > reproduced, in effect, in coffers hanging from the ceiling, in corrugated > walls and in the complex double tier of boxes sloping up the side walls. The Perth Concert Hall is an example of brutalist architecture, with its solid opaque interior, giant projecting roof, and use of white off-form concrete. It forms a counterpoint to the transparent filigree of Council House.AA ‚Äì Obituary ‚Äì March/April 2006 The auditorium features a specially commissioned 3000-pipe organ surrounded by a 160-person choir gallery and an audience seating capacity of 1,729.Perth Concert Hall Web Site The organ, individually designed, cost $100,000 and was commissioned by Ronald Sharp of Sydney, who was also responsible for the organ at the Sydney Opera House. The larger pipes for the organ were imported from the Netherlands. Don Bailey recollects that Ron Sharp was an 'extraordinarily talented person, largely self-educated, who has to his credit the design and construction of a number of organs, mostly in New South Wales. A nine-foot Steinway orchestral concert grand piano (Model D) was also imported from West Germany for installation in the Hall. The Concert Hall was the first in Australia to have a show relay installed so that latecomers could watch on two screens in the foyer while waiting for an appropriate time to enter. Another screen is located at Stage Door. The Perth City Council and State Government, as well as the architects and builders, received many compliments on the Hall as it neared completion from visiting experts in the fields of music, architecture and construction. Operations The Perth Concert Hall has been described as one of the best fine music acoustics venues in Australia. It has played host to a diverse selection of internationally acclaimed performers including the London Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Israel Philharmonic and contemporary performers B.B. King, Sting, k.d. lang, Harry Connick, Jr., Melissa Etheridge, Ray Charles, Rowan Atkinson and Billy Connolly. The majority of concerts by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra are performed at the Perth Concert Hall. The venue is also used for their rehearsals. The venue is also used to host national conventions and exhibitions, award ceremonies and gala dinners. Recent exhibitions include the Steinway piano exhibition in March 2008. In addition, the venue is used for private or corporate functions in areas other than the auditorium, for example in the foyers, bar and caf√©. Association with Perth Concert Hall, Scotland On 27 September 2006 the Perth Concert Hall participated in a twinning ceremony and the signing of Mutual Understanding with the Perth Concert Hall, Scotland. As a result of this twinning the Concert Hall now flies the St Andrews Flag at the front of the venue to commemorate the twinning. Gallery File:Iwelam, Perth Concert Hall.

The city is located in the Cimini mountains, over two tuff scarps, on the SE slope of the former volcano crater now housing the Lake Vico. The city's economy is based largely on agriculture, with production of nuts, chestnuts and wine.  History  The most ancient document mentioning Ronciglione dates to 1103. A historian from the 16th century Orvieto set its foundation around 1045, due to the Prefetti of Vico. Later it was a possession of the Anguillara, a Guelph family of Rome. Pope Paul II conquered it to the Papal States in 1465. In 1526 Ronciglione became a possession of the Farnese, and lived its period of greatest splendour: its industries included manufacturing of copper, iron, paper, weapons and others. Ended in 1649 the Farnese seignory and bought back by Pope Innocent X, in 1728 it received the status of city by Pope Benedict XIII. The Ronciglionesi took active part in the Roman Republic of 1798-99: the French troops, however, crushed the revolt and burnt the city on July 20, 1799.  Main sights  The town's sights include: * The Castle, originally built in the High Middle Ages, with the characteristic angle rounded towers. * The Cathedral, a Baroque edifice designed by Pietro da Cortona, rebuilt by Carlo Rainaldi between 1671 and 1695. The bell tower is from 1734. It houses a Tryptych of Christ by the Viterbese painter Gabriele di Francesco (15th century). * The church of Santa Maria della Provvidenza (11th century), restored in Baroque style, although still retaining a three-floors Romanesque belfry. The interior, with a single nave, houses some frescoes from the 15th century. * The ruins of the church of St. Andrew (12th-13th centuries), with a belfry from 1436. * Church of Santa Maria della Pace, began in 1581 and variously attributed to Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola or Rainaldi. It houses paintings by Sebastiano Conca, Cavalier D'Arpino and a tabernacle by Sansovino. * The suggestive basilica church of Sant'Eusebio, along the Via Cassia, 3 km in direction of Rome. Located on a wide alture, it was built by monks escaped from Palestine in the 7th and 8th centuries. Traces of the ancient coenoby and the belfry can still be seen. The interior of the current edifice has a nave with aisles of irregular dimensions, with 12th-13th centuries frescoes and a Madonna with Child from the 15th century. It is dedicated to St. Eusebius, bishop of Sutri which is nearby. * Villa Lina. A villa with extensive botanical gardens, built by Ulisse Igliori for his wife Lina in 1928 and currently owned and operated as a luxury bed and breakfast.  Culture  Ronciglione is known for its Carnival. Established as a derivative of the Renaissance Carnival of Rome, it has typical \\"empty races\\" in which the horses are left to run without riders. The cities are divided into 9 contrades which contend for the \\"Palio of the Manna\\". The garden scenes of the 2007 film Silk featuring Keira Knightley were filmed on the grounds of Villa Lina. Transportation Ronciglione is served by the SP1 Cimina provincial road, connecting it to SS2 Cassia national road which starts from Rome, and to Viterbo.

Sir Arthur William Steuart Cochrane (27 April 1872 ‚Äì 11 January 1954) was a long-serving Officer of Arms at the College of Arms in London. Biography Arthur Cochrane was the third son of Rev. David Crawford Cochrane, Master of Etwall Hospital (almshouses) and his wife Jane Tomlinson. He was born at Etwall Lodge and educated at Repton School. After serving for a term as secretary to Sir Alfred Scott- Gatty, Garter King of Arms, his heraldic career began on 19 July 1904 when he was appointed Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary. Cochrane took part in the coronation of King George V and was made MVO in 1911. In 1915 he was promoted to the office of Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary and held this office until 1926 when he was promoted to Norroy King of Arms. Two years later, on the death of Gordon Ambrose de Lisle Lee, Cochrane was chosen to succeed him as Clarenceux King of Arms on 26 July 1928. Cochrane was made CVO in 1931 and in 1934, was appointed Advisor on Naval Badges in succession to Major Foulkes its originator. Commander P K Kemp, naval archivist and a fellow member of the committee wrote in The Times \\"Meetings of the Ships Badges Committee with Sir Arthur present were always a delight, for his sense of humour was keen and contagious and his deep and intimate knowledge of heraldic matters was always freely at the disposal of those of us on the committee who fancied themselves as amateur kings of arms.\\"The Times, Letters, 14 January 1954 Since then, the post has been held by an officer of the College of Arms. Cochrane took part in the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and was knighted that year. He also took part in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 and held the office of Clarenceux until his own death in 1954. Cochrane had many interests apart from heraldry. For nearly 30 years he served on the Court of the New England Company‚Äîa charity originally set up by Oliver Cromwell to evangelise the native inhabitants of North America. He was Governor of the Company from 1938 and never missed a meeting. His main active sport was shooting, but he took a lifelong interest in cricket and followed most other games with devotion. He was for many years a member of the MCC and a well-known figure in the pavilion at Lords. He was devoted to his old school and was president of the Reptonian Society.The Times, Obituary, 13 January 1954 From 1950, Cochrane also served as the first Patron of the Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society. Andrew Noble described him as \\"a man of great charm and an engaging companion with an encyclopaedic knowledge of pedigrees.\\" He was a tall distinguished figure and his leonine head made him easily recognisable at State occasions Cochrane married Margaret Peregrina Ilbert (1882‚Äì1952) the fourth daughter of Sir Courtenay Ilbert, clerk to the House of Commons at St Margaret's Westminster on 15 May 1907. They had six children, but his son David disappeared while walking in Greece in 1931, and a daughter Myrtilla died in 1933. A second son Francis died of wounds received in action at El Alamein in 1942. His surviving daughters were married to Sir John Winnifrith (permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture) and Alec Peterson (pioneer in international education). Cochrane was the brother of Alfred Cochrane cricketer and author and Charles Walter Hamilton Cochrane of the Federated Malay States service.

History Gy√∂rgy Kepes, who taught at the New Bauhaus (now the IIT Institute of Design in Chicago), founded the Center at MIT as a way to encourage artistic collaboration on a large civic scale. During its 45-year existence, the CAVS hosted more than 200 artists and fellows that \\"pioneered collaborative works in light, kinetic, environmental and inflatable sculpture, laser, steam, video, electronic music, holography, dance, computer graphics and animation, among other media\\". In 1974, Otto Piene succeeded Kepes as the director of the CAVS. Piene retired in 1994 and the CAVS was taken over by Krzysztof Wodiczko, who, after a hiatus, continued as director. In 2004, Wodiczko brought on board a new staff including Associate Director Larissa Harris, Meg Rotzel, and Joe Zane. The CAVS began a revitalization program which included numerous site visits by international artists, long-term residencies, and the commissioning of new artistic projects. Some of the later visitors included Marjetica Potrƒç, Miranda July, Vito Acconci, Simon Starling, Harrell Fletcher, John Malpede, David Robbins, Fritz Haeg, and Mel Chin. The CAVS was originally located at 40 Massachusetts Avenue (MIT Building W11) near the center of the MIT campus, in space vacated by the relocation of the MIT branch of the Harvard/MIT Cooperative Society to the new Stratton Student Center. This CAVS space was later reassigned to on-campus religious counseling groups, and the CAVS was moved to 265 Massachusetts Avenue (MIT Building N52), north of the main campus. In 2009, the CAVS merged with the MIT Visual Arts Program (VAP), to become the MIT Program in Art, Culture and Technology (ACT), and moved into a new annex to the MIT Media Lab building, at 75 Amherst Street (MIT Building E14).

Biography Feather was born in London, England, into an upper middle-class Jewish family. He learned to play the piano and clarinet without formal training and started writing about jazz and film by his late teens. At the age of twenty-one, Feather made his first visit to the United States, and after working in the UK and the US as a record producer finally settled in New York City in 1939, where he lived until moving to Los Angeles in 1960. Feather was co-editor of Metronome magazine and served as chief jazz critic for the Los Angeles Times until his death. Feather made a significant contribution to the development of jazz broadcasting in Britain, first devising three 'Evergreens of Jazz' programmes broadcast in August and September 1936, using George Scott-Wood and His Six Swingers. Leonard Feather's Swing Time, which was first broadcast National Service in January 1937, probably derived its programme title from 1936 American RKO musical comedy film, songs from which were featured in BBC gramophone recitals several times in December 1936. Initially trailed in the Radio Times as a programme of ‚ÄúGramophone Records of Dance Music (Swing Time)‚Äù. He also wrote the regular 'Tempo di Jazz' column in the Radio Times in the mid-1930s. Feather's compositions have been widely recorded, including \\"Evil Gal Blues\\" and \\"Blowtop Blues\\" by Dinah Washington, and what is possibly his biggest hit, \\"How Blue Can You Get?\\" by blues artists Louis Jordan and B.B. King. But it was as a writer on jazz (as a journalist, critic, historian, and campaigner) that he made his biggest mark: \\"Feather was for a long time the most widely read and most influential writer on jazz.\\" Even jazz enthusiasts who did not read his books and articles would have known him from the liner notes that he wrote for hundreds of jazz albums. He was not always a neutral commentator on the jazz scene: \\"Feather's skill at writing glowing advance press pieces about artists he was to record, including his own compositions on the session, and then reviewing his own productions as if he were an impartial critic, was almost an art form in itself.\\" He also hosted radio shows including \\"Jazz Club\\" in the early 1950s and \\"Platterbrains\\" that aired from 1953 to 1958. Feather organized the first Carnegie Hall jazz concerts, the only two jazz concerts at the original Metropolitan Opera House. He wrote the lyrics to the jazz song \\"Whisper Not\\", which was recorded by Ella Fitzgerald on her 1966 Verve release of the same name. In 1984, Feather was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. Feather's archives are part of the International Jazz Collections at the University of Idaho Library. Feather died from complications of pneumonia in Encino, California, at the age of 80. He was the father of lyricist and songwriter Lorraine Feather.

Due to popular request, it was re-released in 2001 as Undeniably The Whitlams - Reworked. It is their last album to feature guitarist Stevie Plunder. Reworked edition In 2001, Tim Freedman reworked much of the album, dedicating it to the memory of Stevie Plunder and Andy Lewis. Freedman explained that the original recordings and mixings had been rushed, and that these new versions were more comparable to the band's original vision. Roughly half of the album was left as is, while \\"Met My Match\\", \\"Following My Own Tracks\\", \\"1995\\", \\"End of Your World\\" and \\"Shining\\" were remixed, often resulting in a marked difference from the originals. As well as this, \\"I Make Hamburgers\\" was replaced on the album with its single mix, and two previously unreleased songs, \\"Why Doesn't Andy?\\" and \\"Where Are You?\\" were included.

Specific locations where the disease has been reported in the United States include Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Outbreaks in these locations are primarily attributed to muskrat populations; however infected cottontail rabbits have been discovered in Maryland.  Transmission  Tyzzer's disease is transmitted horizontally through the fecal-oral route. Bacterial spores within infected fecal matter can contaminate soil or feed and become orally ingested by a viable host.Barnes, K. H., S. A. Piripi, and C. V. Lohr. 2013. Pathology in Practice. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association 242:765-767. Success of the disease is determined by the amount and virulence of the bacteria and the resistance of the host.Ganaway, J. R., A. M. Allen, and T. D. Moore. 1971.Tyzzer‚Äôs Disease. American Journal of Pathology 64:717-730. Laboratory animals are more susceptible to this disease, as bacteria spores from infected feces can survive in bedding at room temperature for over one year. Animals do occasionally transfer the disease asymptomatically, acting as carriers. Infected animals are more likely to develop the disease when subjected to stressful conditions.  Clinical Signs  Common clinical signs of Tyzzer's Disease include watery diarrhea, depression, emaciation, and a ruffled coat. Other observed clinical signs include melena, depression, lethargy, and decreased temperature. In muskrats, this disease is characterized by extensive hemorrhaging within the lower intestine and abdomen. Due to the fast-acting nature of this disease, infected individuals often do not live long enough to exhibit symptoms. It is not uncommon for an infected animal to die within 1‚Äì10 days of disease contraction. During necropsy, inflammation of the ileum, cecum, and colon are commonly present.Loew, Franklin, Fred Quimby, Lynn Anderson, and James Fox. Laboratory Animal Medicine. 1st ed. San Diego: An Imprint of Elsevier, 2002. Print. Perhaps the most distinctive trait of this disease, however, is the grayish yellow necrotic lesions found on the liver of diseased animals. The number of these spots present can range from one to countless. Occasionally, lesions are discovered in the lower intestinal tract and heart as well. Even with physical signs and symptoms present, a conclusive diagnosis is dependent upon the presence of C. piliforme within the liver of the infected animal.  Prevention  In laboratory animals, prevention includes a low-stress environment, an adequate amount of nutritional feed, and appropriate sanitation measurements. Because animals likely ingest bacterial spores from contaminated bedding and feed, regular cleaning is a helpful method of prevention. No prevention methods are currently available for wild animal populations.  Treatment and Control  Currently, antibiotic drugs such as penicillin or tetracycline are the only effective methods for disease treatment. Within wild populations, disease control consists of reducing the amount of bacterial spores present in the environment. This can be done by removing contaminated carcasses and scat.  History  Tyzzer's disease was first discovered by parasitologist Ernest Tyzzer in 1917 when his entire colony of Japanese waltzing mice suddenly died.Weller, T. H. 1978. Ernest Edward Tyzzer. National Academy of Sciences, Washington D. C., USA. Upon closer observation, Tyzzer discovered necrotic lesions and spore-forming bacillus in the livers of the deceased mice. This led Tyzzer to name the bacteria Bacillus piliformis and deem it the cause of this new disease. Later on, B. piliformis was renamed C. piliforme. In the 1940s, a biologist named Paul Errington found a fatal condition in Iowa muskrat populations that he believed to be a new disease. Dead muskrats were found with blood around their anus and internal bleeding, therefore Errington called this new condition ‚Äúhemorrhagic disease‚Äù. Upon necropsy, lesions were found on the liver of the deceased muskrats. While hemorrhagic disease was identified in dead muskrats across North America, the causative agent remained undetermined. After Errington's death, the name ‚Äúhemorrhagic disease‚Äù was changed to ‚ÄúErrington‚Äôs disease‚Äù. It was not until 1971 that the two diseases were discovered to be the same, upon which the name was reverted to ‚ÄúTyzzer‚Äôs disease‚Äù.

His diploma work at the Academy - a huge clay statue of Samson tearing the chains - broke most existing laws of academic art and put him at odds with his teachers, who apparently destroyed the work with hammers. 1900-1924 Period He travelled to Italy, France, Egypt, Greece, and Germany. During the Russian revolution of 1905 Konenkov was with the workers on the barricades, soon after creating portraits of the heroes of the rebellion in Moscow. Konenkov later supported the Russian Revolution of 1917. In 1922 Konenkov married Margarita Ivanovna Vorontsova, and in 1923 they travelled to the United States to take part in an exhibition of Russian and Soviet art. The trip was supposed to last for a few months, but Konenkov stayed in the States for 22 years, living and working in New York City. Work in US In 1928‚Äì1929 the sculptor visited Italy to meet and work on a portrait of the Soviet writer Maksim Gorky. He had a personal exhibition in Rome. During the American period, Konenkov created a large body of work focusing on Bible themes, notably the Apocalypse. He produced works depicting Jesus Christ and the Christian prophets and apostles. In 1935 he was commissioned by the Princeton University to do a sculpture of Albert Einstein. It is said that Einstein was interested in the work of the Russian sculptor, but was more focused on his wife, Margarita Konenkova.

He \\"had found favor enough with the regime to be asked to design a plaque commemorating the first anniversary of the October Revolution on the Senate Tower of the Kremlin.\\"Philip Marriott, \\"A Friend of the Einsteins,\\" Moscow News, 22 September 2004. Konenkov created sculptures of Aleksandr Pushkin, Anton Chekhov, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ivan Turgenev, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Vasily Surikov, Johann Bach, Paganini, to name a few. He also made wood carved crosses and other pieces for the Marfo- Mariinsky Convent in Moscow.

It originated in 1105 when Vitalis of Mortain established a hermitage in the forest at Savigny in France. Founding Vitalis was a canon of the Collegiate Church of St. Evroul. He resigned his prebend to embrace an eremitical life under Robert of Arbrissel in the forest of Craon, located in Anjou. Leaving the latter, he retired to the forest of Savigny, where he built his own hermitage. The number of disciples who then gathered around him necessitated the construction of adequate buildings, in which was instituted the monastic life, following the Rule of St. Benedict, interpreted in a manner similar to the Cistercians. The community wore grey habits. In 1112, the local lord, Rudolph of Fougeres, confirmed to the monastery the grants he had formerly made to Abbot Vitalis, and from then dates the foundation of the monastery. Once firmly established, its growth was rapid, and it soon became one of the most celebrated in France. The founder was judged worthy of canonization, and many of his successors in the abbatial office, as well as simple monks of the Abbey, were canonized or beatified by the Church, the best known of them being Saint Aymon. Expansion Furness Abbey, England It founded daughter-houses such as that at Furness Abbey and Calder Abbey, both in Cumbria, England. In 1119, Pope Celestine II, then in Angers, took it under his immediate protection, and strongly commended it to the neighbouring nobles. Buckfast Abbey, 2013 Under Geoffroy, successor to Vitalis, Henry I of England, established and generously endowed twenty-nine monasteries of this Congregation in his dominions.Obrecht, Edmond. \\"Abbey of Savigny.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 31 Jan. 2015 The monasteries of Basingwerk (Flintshire) and Neath (Glamorgan) in Wales were founded as Savigniac houses, as was Combermere Abbey. St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin was founded as a Benedictine house in 862, and given to the Congregation of Savigny in 1139. From the number of its foundations Savigny became the head of a Congregation, numbering thirty-three subordinate houses, within thirty years of its own inception. Under Abbot Geoffroy, successor to Vitalis, Henry I of England established and generously endowed twenty-nine monasteries of this Congregation in his dominions. Saint Bernard of C√Æteaux also held them in high esteem, and it was at his request that their monks, in the troubled times of the Antipope Anacletus II, declared in favour of Pope Innocent II. Administrative merger with the Cistercians By 1147, the Order was experiencing financial and administrative difficulties. Abbot Serlo, third successor of the founder, found it difficult to retain his jurisdiction over the English monasteries, who wished to make themselves independent. He determined to affiliate the entire Congregation to C√Æteaux, which was effected at the General Chapter of 1147. Several English monasteries objecting to this, were finally obliged to submit by Pope Eugene III (1148). Each of the newly affiliated houses was surveyed, and brought within conformity of the strictures and standards of the Cistercian order. Saints *Vitalis of Savigny *Godfrey of Amiens * Peter of Avranches *Aimo of Savigny Later history Little by little discipline became relaxed, and once commendatory abbots were introduced (1501) it never regained its first greatness. In 1509 it was pillaged and partly burned by the Calvinists, and records of the following year mention but twenty-four monks remaining. The Abbey continued to exist until the Revolution reduced it to a heap of ruins, and scattered its then existing members. Of all its former dependencies only La Grande Trappe, a daughter of Le Breuil-Beno√Æt Abbey, which was a direct foundation of Savigny, remains. Notes References * Anthony New.

Christian Reformed Church in Lutjegast  History  The original name of the church was Christian Reformed Church in the Netherlands (Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk in Nederland, CGKN). The church was formed in 1869 by the merger of two churches, the Reformed Churches under the Cross and the Separated Christian Congregations, both separated from the Dutch Reformed Church in 1834; an event known as the Afscheiding. Most of the CGKN merged into the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in 1892; a small part remained independent, and carried this name until it was renamed in 1947 to Christian Reformed Churches. At the first Synod eight congregations were represented. A Theological Seminary was opened in The Hague and later was moved to Apeldoorn in 1919. Since then the churches grew steadily till 1985, when membership was 75,000, and today membership fluctuates around this number. It has 11 classes. The church withdrew from the Reformed Ecumenical Council in 1989, and joined the International Conference of Reformed Churches in 1995.http://www.cgk.nl/index.php?geschiedenis It has a theological institute in Apeldoorn, the Theological University of Apeldoorn. It offers the Bachelor of Theology and the Master of Divinity.  Developments  CGK members in the Netherlands per capita in 2008 Several congregations for example in Rotterdam and in Zwartsluis dissolved or merged with the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated) like in Doesburg. In 2012 many Christian Reformed missions were constituted as full-fledged congregations. On 1. January 2013 the denomination had 33 more members than in the previous years.  Theology  They subscribe to the infallibility of the Bible, to the Nicene Creed, the Apostles' Creed, the Athanasian Creed and the Three Forms of Unity (the Heidelberg Catechism, the Belgic Confession and the Canons of Dort).  Statistics  In January 2012 the church has 74,286 members in 181 churches. In recent years membership was steady. In the next year in early 2013 membership grew by more than 30.

He was systematically and unknowingly doped with anabolic steroids for years by East German officials, which caused body chemistry issues. Being a trans man, Krieger subsequently underwent gender reassignment surgery. Krieger says that, while he did experience gender dysphoria before being doped, he regretted not being able to transition without the doping abuses. Athletics career At the 1986 European Championships in Athletics, Krieger won the gold medal in the shot put event after putting the shot at 21.10 m (69 ft 3 in). Krieger retired in 1991. Doping Krieger was systematically doped with steroids from the age of 16 onward. According to Werner Franke and Brigitte Berendonk's 1991 book, Doping: From Research to Deceit, Krieger took almost 2,600 milligrams of steroids in 1986 alone‚Äî nearly 1,000 milligrams more than Ben Johnson took during the 1988 Summer Olympics. As early as the age of 18, Krieger began developing visibly male characteristics. Eventually, years of doping left him with many masculine traits. By 1997, at the age of 31, Krieger underwent sex reassignment surgery and changed his name to Andreas. Krieger had \\"felt out of place and longed in some vague way to be a boy\\", and said in a 2004 interview in The New York Times that he was \\"glad that he became a man\\". However, he felt that receiving hormones without his consent deprived him of the right to \\"find out for myself which sex I wanted to be.\\" Krieger's sex change operation dominated Germany's news headlines and focused widespread attention on the legacy of doping in East Germany, leading other former athletes to speak out in public for the first time. Krieger gave evidence at the trial of Manfred Ewald, leader of the East German sports programme and president of the East German Olympic committee and Manfred Hoeppner, East German medical director in Berlin in 2000. Both Ewald and Hoepner were convicted of accessory to the \\"intentional bodily harm of athletes, including minors\\". Krieger was forced to retire in part due to experiencing severe pain from lifting massive amounts of weight while on steroids. Even today, he has severe pain in his hips and thighs, and can only withstand mild exertion. The Heidi Krieger Medal (), named after Krieger, is now awarded annually to Germans who combat doping. Krieger's gold medal from 1986 forms part of the trophy. Personal life Krieger is married to former East German swimmer Ute Krause, who was also a victim of massive doping by East German sports officials. Broadcasting The PBS series Secrets of the Dead featured Krieger in an episode covering the doping of East German athletes by the East German government covered-up by the Stasi. In 2008 Ukrainian filmmakers released the documentary Doping. Factory of Champions based on Krieger's story. Krieger‚Äôs story was mentioned in the first episode of the BBC documentary The Lost World of Communism. Krieger's half-sister through his father's second marriage, Susann Krieger, won the Deutsche Radiopreis 2017 (German Radio Prize) for her feature Gedoptes Gold ‚Äì Wie aus Heidi Andreas wurde (\\"Doped Gold ‚Äì how Heidi became Andreas\\"), about her brother's life and her reunion with him.

History Originally part of an estate known as Pinchbank (also Birchbank), first recorded in Middlesex in 1310 and owned in the 17th and early 18th centuries by the Howkins family, the property passed to Thomas Reynolds, a director of the South Sea Company, who renamed the estate Strangeways. His son, Francis, sold the property to Admiral John Byng who had the house rebuilt by Isaac Ware in 1754.Wrotham Park, Barnet Hertfordshire Genealogy Admiral John Byng changed the name of the house to Wrotham Park in honour of the original family home in Wrotham, Kent.'South Mimms: Other estates', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5: Hendon, Kingsbury, Great Stanmore, Little Stanmore, Edmonton Enfield, Monken Hadley, South Mimms, Tottenham (1976), pp. 285‚Äì290 Byng never had an opportunity to live in retirement at Wrotham. Following his inadequately equipped expedition to relieve Menorca from the French during the Seven Years' War, he was court martialled and executed in 1757. This event was satirised by Voltaire in his novel Candide. In Portsmouth, Candide witnesses the execution of an officer by firing squad; and is told that \\"in this country, it is wise to kill an admiral from time to time to encourage the others\\" (pour encourager les autres). The house was inherited by John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford in 1847 and passed to his son, George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford, on the first earl's death in 1860. A disastrous fire in 1883 burned slowly enough to permit retrieval of the contents of the house, but gutted it. The house was rebuilt exactly as it was and still remains in the hands of the Byng family.History Wrotham Park Filming location Wrotham Park has often been used as a filming location.Location Agency for Wrotham Park listing official website Wrotham Park was used in Hart to Hart, season 5, Episode 5, \\"Harts and Hounds\\" (1 November 1983).

Early life Battiss was born into an English Methodist family in the Karoo town of Somerset East. He first became interested in archaeology and tribal art as a young boy after moving to Koffiefontein in 1917. In 1919 the Battiss family settled in Fauresmith where he completed his education, matriculating in 1923. In 1924 he became a clerk in the Magistrates Court in Rustenburg. His formal art studies started in 1929 at the Witwatersrand Technical College (drawing and painting), followed by the Johannesburg Training College (a Teacher's Diploma) and etching lessons. Battiss continued his studies while working as a magistrate's clerk, and finally obtained his bachelor's degree in Fine Arts at University of South Africa at the age of 35. Career Walter Battiss Art Museum, 45 Paulet Street, Somerset East Battiss was a founding member of the New Group, a loose friendship of recognized contemporary European and American artists. He was unique among them, in the sense that he was from what were then regarded as the colonies and in that he had not studied in either Europe or North America. In fact, in 1938 he visited Europe for the first time. The following year, he published his first book, The Amazing Bushman. His interest in rock art had a very profound impact on his ideas, regarding San painting as an important art form. He was also influenced by African cultural Ndebele beadwork and generally by pre-Islamic cultures and calligraphy. In 1949 he befriended Picasso who would have an influence on his style. He visited Greece in 1966-1968 and the Seychelles in 1972, which inspired his make-believe Fook Island. Battiss published nine books, wrote many articles and founded the periodical \\"De Arte\\". He taught art at Pretoria Boys High School from 1936 for most of the next 30 years and at the Pretoria Art Centre, of which was the principal from 1953‚Äì58.Johans Borman, \\"Walter Whall Battiss (1906 ‚Äì 1982)\\", Johans Borman, Retrieved 10 July 2011 He also taught at UNISA where he became Professor of Fine Art in 1964 and retired in 1971. In 1973 he was awarded a D.Litt. et Phil. (honoris causa) from UNISA. In 1981 he donated all his work to the newly opened \\"Walter Battiss Museum\\" in his birthplace of Somerset East. Walter Battiss died of a heart attack in Port Shepstone, KwaZulu-Natal on 20 August 1982. Influence Walter Battiss's long career as an artist was devoted to the study of man in his environment; first in the context of Africa and rock art, then, later, in the interpretation of this concept in its broadest sense. His versatility and influence as an innovator and the incentive he provided for many aspiring artists secured him a special place among leading South African artists. Fook Island This \\"island of the imagination\\" was a materialization of Battiss' philosophy for which he created a map, imaginary people, plants, animals, a history as well as a set of postage stamps, currency, passports and driver's licenses. He created a Fookian language with a full alphabet as well. This utopian 'island' was a composite of the many islands he visited ‚Äì which included Zanzibar, the Seychelles, Madagascar, Fiji, Hawaii, Samoa, the Greek Isles and the Comores ‚Äì blended together in his customary imaginative fashion. In Battiss's words, \\"It is something that does not exist. I thought that I would take an island ‚Äì the island that is inside all of us. I would turn this island into a real thing ... I would give it a name\\". Fook was a result of his fertile imagination as well as his opposition to the Conceptualist Art movement of the 1960s and 70s, in Europe and America. The movement espoused that the construction of art was confined to the 'moment' in which it was created. He believed to the contrary that all art exists in the now and this he argued to represent with Fook Island, which was always in the now and always an essential part of reality. South Africans including actress Janet Suzman, artist (and Battiss prot√©g√©) Norman Catherine, writer Esm√© Berman and many others embraced the philosophy of Fook Island. The journalist Jani Allan interviewed Battiss in 1982 and also agreed to his request of becoming a 'resident' of the imaginary island. Battiss's Fookian Driver's License was accepted in America and the colourful pages of his Fookian Passport has official stamps from Australia, Britain and Germany. A Fookian banknote was also exchanged at a Rome airport for $10.

It is located on Jamestown Island, on the James River at Jamestown, Virginia and operated as a partnership between Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) and the U.S. National Park Service as part of Colonial National Historical Park. The site was designated Jamestown National Historic Site on December 18, 1940 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It was also designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in 2007 by the American Chemical Society. It is adjacent and complementary with Jamestown Settlement, a living history museum built run by the Commonwealth of Virginia to interpret the early colony. History Jamestown, first established in the Virginia Colony at Jamestown, on May 13, 1607, was the site of the first permanent English settlement in North America. Upon arrival, the hundred-some colonists set about constructing a fort to protect themselves from the nearby Virginia Indian tribes and from a potential attack from the Spanish settlements in Florida. Between 1609 and 1610, lack of local food and replenishment of supplies from England, and inability to cope with disease led to the \\"starving time\\", which only 60 colonists survived. The colony was resupplied with new colonists, and over the next several decades became the center of government for the English colonists, and a port town for additional arrivals from England to the new land, with about 500 people living in or around it at its peak. Jamestown was the capital of the Virginia Colony, and saw Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, led to the burning down of most of Jamestown, but the town was rebuilt. After an accidental second burning in 1698, the capital was relocated to higher ground at Middle Plantation in 1699, which was then renamed Williamsburg. Soon, Jamestown began a period of rapid decline. By the 1750s, the land was owned and heavily cultivated primarily by the Travis and Ambler families. Due to its location on the James River, the island saw some action during the American Revolutionary War (1776-1781) when the area was used as a military post where American and British prisoners of war were exchanged. In the 19th century, Jamestown Island reverted to little-used farmland, and in 1862 became the site of Doller's Point Battery, a Confederate earthworks during the American Civil War intended to protect Richmond against Union gunboats. Swann's Point Battery was a Union Army battery located Swann's Point above the mouth of Gray's Creek on the James River, opposite Jamestown Island from 1862-1865. The Ambler Farm was burned by escaped slaves, who found the desolate island to be a haven. The area then reverted to farmland until preservation efforts began at the end of the 19th century. Mission According to their website, Jamestown Rediscovery is \\"committed to supporting preservation, education, and the archaeological investigation of Historic Jamestowne, the original site of the first permanent English settlement in America.\\" Preservation Late in the 19th century, Jamestown became the focus of new historical interest, and by 1893, the site of Jamestown was owned by Mr and Mrs Edward Barney, who donated of land on Jamestown Island, including the 17th-century tower of the Jamestown Church, to Preservation Virginia historic preservation. By this time, erosion from the river had eaten away the island's western shore; visitors began to conclude that the site of James Fort lay completely underwater. With federal assistance, a sea wall was constructed in 1900 to stabilize and protect the area from further erosion. In 1907, with the site's 300th anniversary in mind, the present Jamestown Church was rebuilt by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, re-using the surviving 17th century tower. In 1932, George C. Gregory discovered the foundation of the first capitol building, circa 1646, at Jamestown. In 1934, Colonial National Historical Park obtained the remaining of the island and partnered with Preservation Virginia to preserve the area and present it to visitors in an educational manner. The site was designated Jamestown National Historic Site on December 18, 1940, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The National Park Service maintains the remaining portions of the island with recreations of building foundations of the post-1610 Jamestown port town. In 1957, with the site's 350th anniversary in mind, New Discoveries at Jamestown was published. In 1994, with the quadricentennial year approaching, Preservation Virginia agreed to fund a 10-year archaeological project called Jamestown Rediscovery to search for any remains of James Fort, led by William Kelso. By 1996, they had found James Fort, which had only lost a western bulwark to river erosion. In 2006, many preparations were underway for the Jamestown 2007 event celebrating the 400th anniversary of the settlement. The site was visited by several dignitaries, including President George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Queen Elizabeth II visited to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the landing on May 4, 2007 ‚Äì she had previously visited the park in October 1957. As noted by Queen Elizabeth during her state visit to the U.S. in 2007, Jamestowne was the beginning, not just of America, but of the British Empire. Significant structures The Historic Jamestowne area of Jamestown Island includes several important structures, both historical and modern.  Old Town  This area includes the ruins within the original 1607 James Fort, the restored Jamestown Church, and the ruins of the Statehouse. New Town Situated to the east of the Old Towne area, this area includes the Ambler Mansion ruins, the rowhouse, and Governor Harvey House.  Monuments  The tall Tercentenary Monument, which resembles the Washington Monument in Washington, was placed on Jamestown Island by the United States government in 1907 for the 300th anniversary of the settlement. It cost $50,000 at the time, stands 103 feet (c.31 meters) tall, and is made of New Hampshire granite. The north face inscription reads: Jamestown - The first permanent colony of the English people. The birthplace of Virginia and of the United States - May 13, 1607. The General Assembly Monument was unveiled on July 31, 1907, as a gift of the Norfolk branch of the APVA. Located near the church, it is a small obelisk designed to commemorate the first meeting of Virginia's General Assembly in July 1619. A horse trough, a gift from the Society of Colonial Wars in 1907, was installed in a place now just outside the Yeardley House offices of the Jamestown Rediscovery project. It was designed by architect Harold Van Buren Magonigle. The APVA Gates, a brick and iron entrance to the land owned by the APVA, was presented on May 9, 1909 by The Colonial Dames of America. They were relocated to its present location northeast of the Memorial Church in 1957. The bronze John Smith statue was unveiled on May 13, 1909, and was a gift from Joseph Bryan and his wife, Isobel, early supporters of the APVA. William Couper, from Norfolk, designed the statue. It has a granite base, and measures 20 feet tall. The inscription on the base reads: John Smith, Governor of Virginia, 1608 and features Smith's adopted coat of arms and motto, vincere est vivere (\\"to live is to conquer\\"). The bronze Pocahontas statue was unveiled in June 1922, and stood south of the church, where it could \\"welcome\\" visitors coming from off the ferry. It was moved to the low rock base near the APVA entrance gate for the 350th celebration in 1957. In 2014 it was moved slightly to the west to make way for archaeological work. Also in June 1922, The Colonial Dames of America erected the Hunt Shrine (dedicated to Robert Hunt), the first Anglican minister of the colony. It was designed by Ralph Adams Cram. The shrine frames a bas-relief depicting the 1607 service. It was first set with its back to the James River, but in 1960 it was rotated to face the river from the northern earthwork of the Civil War's Fort Pocahontas. Its inscription, taken from John Smith, reads > Our factions were oft qualified, and our wants and greater extremities so > comforted that they seemed easie in comparison of what we endured after his > memorable death. ... The wooden cross that stands near the entrance to the Archaearium museum was erected by the APVA in 1957 to honor the settlers who died in first years of the settlement. The inscription reads: To the Glory of God and in grateful memory of those early settlers, the founders of this nation who died at Jamestown during the first perilous years of the colony. Their bodies lie along the ridge beyond this cross, in the earliest known burial ground of the English in America. Voorhees Archaearium Officially named the Nathalie P. and Alan M. Voorhees Archaearium, or simply the Voorhees Archaearium is a museum with excavated artifacts and exhibits about Jamestowne. The building is located over the excavated remains of the last Statehouse in Jamestown, which visitors can see. The museum onsite opened just prior to the 400th anniversary and displays objects that belonged to Jamestown colonists 400 years ago, unearthed from the long lost James Fort site in a 7,500 sq. foot gallery space integrating both life and death experiences f the colonists and the landscape they shaped. Additional archaeological materials from James Fort are featured in the Smithsonian Institution's limited exhibition, Written In Bone: Forensic Files of the 17th-Century Chesapeake from February 7, 2009 to January 6, 2013 at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C.

It is located in the Palazzo di Riserva on Strada Garibaldi #5 in central Parma, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. History The museum was created by the efforts of Glauco Lombardi (1881‚Äì1971) to collect, study, and conserve the artistic and documentary heritage of 19th-century Parma under the Bourbons (1748‚Äì1802, 1847‚Äì1859) and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma (1816‚Äì1847). Many of these items were largely scattered during the period of Italian Unification in various residences of the Savoy family. Lombardi often recovered the works from the antiquary market or in private collections. From 1915 to 1943, the original nucleus of the Museo Lombardi was housed in the ballroom and adjacent rooms of the Ducal Palace of Colorno. In 1934, Lombardi was able to buy for the museum the precious objects that had belonged to Duchess Marie Louise, grandmother of the then owner, count Giovanni Sanvitale, The Second World War and post-war years brought further difficulties, and not until 1961, was the Museo Glauco Lombardi able to reopen in new premises, within the Palazzo di Riserva in the center of Parma. From 1997 to 1999, the museum underwent a major restoration, in order to account for the new museum premises and modern and effective systems of security and display. The collections include dresses, furniture, inkwells, engravings, jewelry, and porcelain. The museum displays a collection of 19th-century paintings from artists active or collected in Parma, including Paolo Toschi (1788‚Äì1854), Giuseppe Molteni (1800‚Äì1867), Fran√ßois G√©rard (1770‚Äì1837) and Giuseppe Drugman (1810‚Äì1846). .

Education Edwardes was born in Port Elizabeth, and was matriculated from St. Andrew's College in 1947 before graduating from Rhodes University. Career Edwardes began his career in 1951 as a management trainee for battery manufacturer Chloride. In 1966, he served as the general manager of Alkaline Batteries, one of the group's operating companies at Redditch, Worcestershire, UK. He later joined the Chloride main board, became chief executive in 1971 and remained in that position until 1977. He was appointed to the UK's National Enterprise Board, a quango whose role was to provide financing to large UK state-owned enterprises (or nationalized industries), including the country's ailing motor giant, British Leyland, when it was established in 1975. In 1977, he was appointed as chief executive of British Leyland, and within two weeks he became chairman as the company's board was 'pruned' from 13 to 7 members. In 1979, he was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours. The next year, he attracted criticism for a speech to the CBI Conference in which he said, \\"If the Cabinet do not have the wit and imagination to reconcile our industrial needs with the fact of North Sea oil, they would do better to leave the bloody stuff in the ground\\". His tenure at British Leyland lasted until 1982, when he was replaced by Harold Musgrove. In 1982, on his retirement from British Leyland as CEO, Edwardes was presented with a British racing green Jaguar XJS. He later had this car shipped to South Africa, where he used it for board meetings at General Motors South Africa in 1988. In 1984, he became chairman of computer manufacturer ICL, but resigned six months later when the company was acquired by STC. He then became chairman of Dunlop Holdings until its 1985 sale to BTR plc, briefly returned to Chloride as chairman in 1986, and in 1988 became chairman of Charter Consolidated. In his book Back from the Brink, Edwardes discusses his experiences at British Leyland. Personal life In 1958 Edwardes married Mary Margaret Finlay, a psychotherapist and anti-apartheid campaigner.

For this reason, the Church of England avoids the use of the prenominal title \\"Saint\\" with reference to uncanonised individuals and is restrained in what it says about them in its liturgical texts. In order not to seem to imply grades of sanctity, or to discriminate between holy persons of the pre- and post- Reformation periods, the title \\"Saint\\" is not used at all in the calendar, even with reference to those who have always been known by that title, for example the Apostles. The ninth Lambeth Conference held in 1958 clarified the commemoration of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church in the Anglican Communion. Resolution 79 stated: > There is no single calendar for the various churches making up the Anglican > Communion; each makes its own calendar suitable for its local situation. As > a result, the calendar here contains a number of figures important in the > history of the English church. Calendars in different provinces will focus > on figures more important to those different countries. At the same time, > different provinces often borrow important figures from each other's > calendars as the international importance of different figures becomes > clear. In this way the calendar of the Church of England has importance > beyond the immediate purpose of supporting the liturgy of the English > Church. It is, for example, one of the key sources of the calendar for the > international daily office Oremus., Oremus calendar As there is no mention > of the Patriarchs of Old on the Current Church of England Calendar, one is > left to presume, theologically and liturgically, that the Patriarchs of Old > are not included on All Saints' Day, 1 November (as they are in the Catholic > calendar), since according to the Lambeth Conference, 1958, the purpose was > to devise a guide for the commemoration of Saints and Heroes applicable to > the Christian Church in England. Holy Days are variously categorised as > Principal Feasts, Festivals, Lesser Festivals, or Commemorations. In order > to minimise problems caused by the ambivalence regarding the manner of > commemoration of uncanonised persons, all such days are Lesser Festivals or > Commemorations only, whose observance is optional. The following table lists > the Holy Days in the calendar of Common Worship, the calendar most generally > followed in the Church of England (though the calendar of the Book of Common > Prayer is still authorised for use).

The table includes the feast date, > the name of the person or persons being commemorated, their title, the > nature and location of their ministry or other relevant facts, and year of > death, all in the form in which they are set out in the authorised Common > Worship calendar. The typography shows the level of the observance: BOLD > CAPITALS denote Principal Feasts and Principal Holy Days, bold denotes > Festivals, roman denotes Lesser Festivals, and italics denote > Commemorations.

Its editor, founder and publisher was Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah (or, as she was known then, Zeb-un-Nissa Hamidullah). As editor of the Mirror, Begum Hamidullah became the first woman editor in Pakistan. The Mirror was published monthly.  History  Zeb-un-Nissa Hamidullah founded the Mirror in October, 1951; after she left Dawn. Her mission statement was to \\"foster feelings of unity and amity throughout the country\\". Most of her initial capital came from her husband and her family, and they soon rented two rooms at the Hotel Metropole in Karachi. The magazine was originally published at Din Muhammadi Press, as Hamidullah did not get her own press until the 1960s. It was Pakistan's first social pictorial, and soon achieved popularity in both wings of the state. It had pictures and articles about society in Pakistan, and advice columns. However, it soon grew to be more than just a social glossy. Begum Hamidullah began writing serious editorials, which contained her by-line on the current economic and political problems in the country. The editor held several jobs in the magazine, doing everything from proof-reading to picture editing, as she revealed in her interview with Asif Noorani in 1997.  1957 ban  In November 1957, Begum Zeb-un-Nissa Hamidullah, the Mirror's editor, wrote a blistering and opinionated editorial in defence of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, whose ministry in East Pakistan had been abruptly forced to resign due to threats from Iskander Mirza. In retaliation, the central government imposed a six-month ban on the magazine and privately threatened its editor. Begum Hamidullah responded by taking the government to the Supreme Court and, with the help of eminent lawyer A.K Brohi, managed to win. The Mirror was awarded the costs of the petition, and the incident made journalistic history in Pakistan, as it was the first case of a woman journalist appearing successfully before the highest court in the land.  Mirror Press  In April 1961, Begum Hamidullah began her own publishing house to publish the Mirror. Named Mirror Press, it published the magazine from 1961 till its closure 10 years later, and also published a few other books as Mirror Publications. When Begum Hamidullah closed the Mirror and left for Ireland in 1971, Mirror Press was sold to an outside party. Though still alive, the company is no longer functional.  Controversy in the sixties  In October 1962, Begum Hamidullah wrote an open letter to President Ayub Khan. Entitled 'Please Mr. President!\\", it expressed concern about the government's treatment of student protests. The letter was published in the Mirror. It was an emotional statement, describing the feelings of the people of Pakistan, as they saw \\"the blood that stained the streets of Pakistan\\". She stated that, owing to his authoritarian style of rule, she was losing her faith in him and had placed his picture upside down. In the November edition of the Mirror that year, she published his reply; a breakdown of the statements in her letter, each being justified. He concluded by saying \\"I request [you] to ascertain facts before publishing highly emotional editorials\\". In 1969, before he stepped down, she republished \\"Please Mr. President!\\", alongside a new editorial, \\"No, thank you, Sir\\", in which she said that the problems which she talked about in \\"Please, Mr. President!\\" were still very much there, and that \\"Pakistan will continue to erupt to erupt as long as you, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, remain its President.\\" This editorial angered Ayub Khan, but, ironically, he took her advice in the end, and abdicated in favour of General Yahya Khan. Because of these events, the Mirror became highly controversial in the '60s. The tension between Begum Hamidullah and Ayub Khan escalated, resulting in the magazine being banned twice, and government advertisements being almost completely revoked from the periodical. However, it was also during this period that Begum Hamidullah acquired her own Mirror Press, and founded a small publishing house, Mirror Publications.  Closure  In 1971, Begum Hamidullah moved to Ireland with her husband, and the magazine folded the next year. It heralded the end of an era. As one Pakistani journalist put it, \\"The paper closed down...after twenty-one years of struggle against authoritarian trends in our government and bigotry and fanaticism in society...the closure of the paper was, thus, a big loss to Pakistani journalism.\\" Hamidullah later clarified in interviews that it was a closure more out of necessity than choice: she wanted one of her daughters to take over, but neither obliged. As a result, her departure meant the end of the groundbreaking magazine.  Features  The Mirror contained many features which were repeated in nearly all the editions. Those were:  Speaking Seriously  This feature contained Begum Zeb-un-Nissa Hamidullah's controversial editorials, which brought much fame and controversy to the magazine.  Junior's Corner  Hosted by the mysterious and kind Apa Jan and containing letters and stories by children, this feature earned many fans in both East and West Pakistan, who joined a club called 'The Mirror League'.  Dulha-Dulhan  This featured consisted of two pages of pictures of newly-wed couples in both the wings of Pakistan.  The Mirror reflects the World  This feature contained pictures and articles about Pakistani dignitaries and diplomats around the globe.  Social Notes  The magazine's largest feature, this section was devoted to the social doings of Pakistani society. There were many different ingenious headings for featured cities thought up by Begum Hamidullah, such as 'Karachi Chronicle', 'Capital Calling', 'Culled from Quetta' and 'Dacca Doings'.  Criticism  Although popular, the Mirror was criticised by many people as being too frivolous. The intelligentsia said it was merely a social glossy, with no importance apart from the editorials. Despite this, it gained a large following in both east and West Pakistan. When asked about the criticism, and her reaction to it in 1997 interview, Begum Hamidullah said that the Mirror \\"was just for light reading\\".

Originally developed for use on Microcom's own family of modems, the protocol was later openly licensed and used by most of the modem industry, notably the \\"big three\\", Telebit, USRobotics and Hayes. MNP was later supplanted by v.42bis, which was used almost universally starting with the first v.32bis modems in the early 1990s. Overview Although Xmodem was introduced 1977, as late as 1985 The New York Times described XMODEM first, then discussed MNP as a leading contender, and that 9600 baud modems \\"are beginning to make their appearance.\\" By 1988, the Times was talking about 9600 and 19.2K, and that \\"At least 100 other brands of modems follow\\" MNP (compared to Hayes' use of LAP-B). Error correction basics Modems are, by their nature, error-prone devices. Noise on the telephone line, a common occurrence, can easily mimic the sounds used by the modems to transmit data, thereby introducing errors that are difficult to notice. For some tasks, like reading or writing simple text, a small number of errors can be accepted without causing too many problems. For other tasks, like transferring computer programs in machine format, even one error can render the received data useless. As modems increase in speed by using up more of the available bandwidth, the chance that random noise would introduce errors also increases; above 2400 bit/s these errors are quite common. To deal with this problem, a number of file transfer protocols were introduced and implemented in various programs. In general, these protocols break down a file into a series of frames or packets containing a number of bytes from the original file. Some sort of additional data, normally a checksum or CRC, is added to each packet to indicate whether the packet encountered an error while being received . The packet is then sent to the remote system, which recomputes the checksum or CRC of the data and compares it to the received checksum or CRC to determine if it was received properly. If it was, the receiver sends back an ACK (acknowledgement) message, prompting the sender to send the next packet. If there was any problem, it instead sends a NAK (not-acknowledged) message, and the sender resends the damaged packet. This process introduces \\"overhead\\" into the transfer. For one, the additional checksum or CRC uses up time in the channel that could otherwise be used to send additional data. This is a minor concern, however, unless the packets are very small (which they are in UUCP for instance). A more serious concern is the time needed for the receiver to examine the packet, compare it to the CRC, and then send the ACK back to the sender. This delay grows in relative terms as the speed of the modem increases; the latency of the phone line is a constant, but the amount of data that could be sent in that fixed amount of time grows as the speed increases. To address this problem, newer protocols use a system known as \\"sliding windows\\", allowing the sender to begin transmitting the next packet without receiving an ACK message; only if the ACK does not arrive for some time will it resend the packet. MNP handshaking MNP connections were set up after the modems had successfully connected. The originating system (the modem that placed the call, or sometimes the computer it was connected to) would send a short series of 8-bit characters known as the \\"Originator Detection Pattern\\" (ODP). The string consisted of \`DC1\` with even parity (\`10001000\`) at the start, one or two \`$FF\` (\`11111111\`), \`DC1\` with odd parity (\`10001001\`) and the same number of \`$FF\` again. Once the ODP had been sent, the sender begins the \\"Detection Phase Timer\\", or T400. The answering system had to properly respond to the ODP within this time, or the originating system would assume that MNP was not supported. If the answering modem did support MNP, or the later V.42 standards that superseded it, it responded with one of the \\"Answerer Detection Patterns\\" (ADP). If the modem supported compression, it responded with the 8-bit version of the string \`E\`\`$FF\`[\`$FF\`]\`C\`\`$FF\`[\`$FF\`], indicating \\"EC\\", or \\"Error correction and Compression\\". If error correction was supported, but compression was not, the ADP was \`E\`\`$FF\`[\`$FF\`]\`NUL\`\`$FF\`[\`$FF\`], indicating \\"E\\", or \\"Error correction\\". The standard allowed any value of the last four bits in the second character to indicate difference standards, but this was never implemented. The ADP had to be sent at least ten times. If the ADP is successfully received within the T400 time, the system has successfully determined that the two systems support some sort of error correction and/or compression. At that point, the systems enter the \\"Protocol Establishment Phase\\" where the details of these standards are determined and selected. This starts with the originating system sending the L-ESTABLISH string, indicating the mode is switching to the error correcting mode, and the answering system responds with the same L-ESTABLISH. The answering system can reject the attempt by sending L- RELEASE. This phase is timed by T401. The final step in the handshaking process is to send an MNP packet containing the \\"SABME\\" command, short for \\"set asynchronous balanced mode extended\\". This is sent by the originator, containing a number of data fields indicating the exact protocols it can support. The answering system responds with a modified version of the same packet, switching bits in the data to indicate it is successful. From that point on, the two systems exchange data using the error correcting packet protocol. If this last step does not complete during timer T401, the originator sends L-RELEASE and returns to a non-MNP link. MNP \\"classes\\" Microcom's idea was to move the file-transfer protocol out of the host computer and place it in the modem instead. In doing so, all data being transferred would be error corrected, not just file transfers. This also meant that devices with no processor, like dumb terminals, could enjoy an error-free link. The original protocol was extremely simple and rather inefficient, leading to a variety of improved protocols referred to as \\"classes\\". Each class generally improved performance over earlier versions, which were retained only for backward-compatibility reasons. MNP 1 and 2 The first MNP standard, retroactively known as MNP Class 1, or simply MNP 1, was a simple half-duplex protocol similar to XModem in nature. Lacking sliding window support, throughput efficiency was fairly low, at about 70%. That meant that on a 2400 bit/s modem, like the ones Microcom sold, throughput would be limited to about 1690 bit/s when MNP 1 was in use. This system was created primarily to be as easy as possible to implement in limited hardware, which explains its simplicity. With low-cost processing power improving, Microcom introduced MNP 2, a full-duplex version of MNP 1 that allowed the ACK messages to be returned while the next outbound packet was already starting. This eliminated the pause while the modem waited for the ACK to be returned, adding the requirement that the system needed some memory to track whether or not an ACK was received within a given amount of time. Since the inter-packet delay was reduced, only the overhead of the CRC remained, improving throughput to about 84%.Durda, Frank. MNP 3 In normal use, a modem can send or receive data at any point in time, a mode of operation known as \\"asynchronous\\". The modem can determine the speed of the sender's data by listening to the bits being sent to it, and \\"locking\\" its clock to the speed of bits being received. Since the data can arrive at any time, there is no precise timing; the clock may have to be re-adjusted for pauses as the user stops typing (for instance). Unfortunately this sort of clock decoding does not work unless there are at least some transitions between 1 and 0 in the data; a long stream of 0s or 1s has no transitions in it, making it impossible to know where the data for any particular byte starts. In order to avoid this problem, additional framing bits are added to either end of every byte, typically one bit on either side known as the \\"start and stop bits\\". This guarantees at least one 1-to-0 transition for every byte, more than enough to keep the clocks locked. However, these bits also expand every 8 bits of data (one byte) to 10 bits, an overhead of 20%. When using a file transfer protocol, the packets themselves offer their own framing. The packets will always send a continuous stream of data, so the clock cannot \\"drift\\" in the same way that it could for data being sent by a user typing on a keyboard. By turning off these framing bits when operating on an error- corrected link, that 20% overhead can be eliminated. This is precisely what MNP 3 did. After negotiating and determining that both modems supported MNP 3, the framing bits were turned off, improving overall efficiency by about 20%. This almost perfectly offset the overhead of the protocol, meaning that when using MNP 3, a user can expect to get very close to the ideal 2400 bit/s throughput (versus 1900 bit/s). MNP 4 MNP 4 was a further improvement on MNP 3, adding a variable packet size system they referred to as Adaptive Packet Assembly. In the case of MNP the overhead of the packet system was relatively small, but even the multi-byte CRC was taking up space better used for data. Generally using a larger packet would address this, because the CRC remains the same fixed size and thus its relative overhead is reduced compared to the amount of data. However, when an error does occur, using larger packets also means that more data has to be re-sent. On noisy lines, this can slow overall throughput. With MNP 4 the two modems constantly monitor the line for dropped packets, and if a certain threshold is crossed (selected by the user), the modem drops back to a smaller packet size. This means that when a packet is dropped, the amount of data that has to be re-sent is smaller, leading to better throughput. On good quality lines, using larger packets means that the overhead of the CRC is reduced. Packets could be between 64 and 256 bytes, and allowed the user to force it to a particular size if they wished. MNP 4 also introduced Data Phase Optimization, a simple change to the protocol that allowed some of the packet-framing information to be dropped after the link was set up, further reducing protocol overhead. The combination of these features, along with MNP 3's lack of byte-framing, allowed for a further increase in throughput efficiency. MNP 5 An even more radical change was made for MNP 5, introducing on-the-fly data compression in the modem. With MNP 5, the data received from the computer are first compressed with a simple algorithm, and then passed into the MNP 4 packetizing system for transmission. On best-case data the system offered about 2:1 compression, but in general terms about 1.6:1 was typical, at least on text. As a result, a 2400 bit/s modem would appear to transfer text at ~4000 bit/s. This dramatic increase in throughput allowed Microcom modems to remain somewhat competitive with models from other companies that were otherwise nominally much faster. For instance, Microcom generally produced 1200 and 2400 bit/s modems using commodity parts, while companies like USRobotics and Telebit offered models with speeds up to 19200 bit/s. However, this improvement in performance was only available if modems on both ends supported MNP. That made the system only really attractive for sites installing the modems at both ends of the links; for dial-up services like bulletin board systems (BBS) there was no compelling reason to use a Microcom device when the end-user was unlikely to have one. Even in the cases where the user was in control of both ends of the link, Microcom's \\"proprietary\\" modems were less interesting than models from other companies that offered much higher \\"real world\\" throughputs. In order to create a market for Microcom modems, starting with MNP 5 they took the radical step of licensing the entire MNP suite for free. The idea was that this would dramatically increase the number of modems with MNP installed, making \\"real\\" Microcom modems more attractive. Moreover, newer standards with improved performance would offer even better performance when there was a Microcom modem at both ends of the link. Unfortunately the plan backfired. The introduction of the greatly improved LAPM compression system in the v.42bis standard outpaced Microcom's own advancements, diluting the value of a \\"real\\" Microcom model almost to zero. Using v.42bis and commodity parts, a huge number of low-cost modems with even better performance that Microcom's were soon available. Although Microcom continued to introduce newer standards, they were largely ignored and Microcom stopped being a force in the market. MNP 6 The introduction of the v.32 led to a number of standard 9600 bit/s modems, almost all of which offered MNP 5\\\\. To further differentiate themselves from what was becoming a commodity market (although not truly so until the introduction of the v.32bis SupraFAXModem 14400 in 1991), Microcom created MNP 6\\\\. MNP 6's main feature was Statistical Duplexing, which could dedicate more or less of the bandwidth to one side or the other of the modem link. For instance, if one machine was sending a large file, the other end would only send back a small amount of information, the ACK and NAK messages. In this case the modems would give as much of the channel as possible to the sender, offering one-way bandwidth up to 19,200 bit/s. This did not actually require any changes to the modulation system: normally a 9600 bit/s modem had a full 9600 bit/s channel in both directions, for a total of 19200 bit/s; MNP 6 simply allowed more or less of that bandwidth to be given to one side or the other, instead of leaving it fixed at 9600 both ways. This basic concept was already widely used in the industry, having formed the basis for Hayes's Express 96 protocol, USRobotics' HST Telebit's PEP, and (briefly) the CompuCom SpeedModem. All of these standards found it very difficult to survive in the v.32bis dominated market, and, like them, MNP 6 was largely ignored. A less notable addition to MNP 6 was Universal Link Negotiation. With the introduction of additional modulation modes, notably v.32 and later additions, the modems on either end of the link had to spend an increasing amount of time negotiating a common standard. For instance, a v.32bis modem would first send tones into the line to try to get a 14.4 link; if that failed after a time, it would try 9600, 2400 and finally 1200 bit/s. Since each of these standards defined a minimum period of time to \\"try\\" for a link, the delay grew over 10 seconds. ULN avoided this delay by always negotiating the link at 2400 bit/s with no error-correction turned on. Although this eliminated compatibility with older 1200 bit/s modems, by this point in time they were extremely rare. Once the connection was made, which occurred quickly, both modems sent a small identification string to the remote modem. Both modems then examined the string and selected the fastest common mode. The caller then re-negotiated once at that higher speed. MNP 7 MNP 7 introduced new compression algorithms with a claimed improvement to 3:1 compression on text files. However, by the time MNP 7 was introduced, the v.42bis standard was offering 4:1 compression. MNP 9 MNP 9 (there was apparently no 8 released) improved the Universal Link Detection to add newer high-speed modes, but was otherwise identical to MNP 7\\\\. MNP 10 MNP 10 introduced a new error- correction protocol designed specifically to work well on the noisy phone lines widely used in eastern Europe. Unlike earlier versions like MNP 4, MNP 10 constantly monitored line quality and adjusted packet size back up if conditions improved. In 1991 Microcom licensed MNP 10 to Rockwell International for use in their extremely popular modem chip sets. Since almost all modems with the exception of USR's models used the Rockwell chipset from about 1995, MNP 10 became fairly widely deployed (if not used). USR eventually added MNP 10 to their V.everything series modems, effectively making it universal. MNP 10 was later expanded to MNP 10EC, the \\"EC\\" standing for \\"Extended Cellular\\". This was a series of modifications that allowed MNP 10 to deal with the transmission pauses when a cell phone moves from one cell to another, which would normally be interpreted as errors in the line. Using MNP 10EC, these pauses are correctly identified as \\"not errors\\", and the link speed remains higher. Its success led to the AT&T; Paradyne-created competitor, ETC. MNP 10EC was particularly attractive in the cellular role due to the inclusion of the ULN link-negotiation method originally introduced in MNP 6 (and improved in MNP 9). On a cellular network where all air-time is billed, the faster setup saved money. MNP 10EC had a limited life span, as the cell networks turned to a variety of all-digital systems that no longer required a modem to connect to a computer.

It may be derived from Flamins, the Walloon word for Flemings. The word can be equally used as an adjective or substantive and the term flamingantisme is sometimes used to designate their ideology. The word wallingant is similarly used to describe adherents of the Walloon Movement which also gives rise to the comparable term wallingantisme. The flamingant movement was originally initiated by the priests in Flanders under the French occupation after 1792. The secular republic invaded the Austrian Netherlands three years later, retaining them until 1815. This was very badly received in the Catholic provinces, alarming the clergy and damaging those economic sectors which were in competition with metropolitan France. Thus all the Walloon vineyards were ruined and the textile sector in Flanders went into decay. The French language, which had been the language of the leisured classes under feudalism, was imposed throughout the administration. With the fall of the French Empire in 1815, the movement became dormant. In 1830, Belgians of the north, alongside those of the south, overthrew Dutch rule uniting behind their common Roman Catholic religion and distrust of the Dutch government. The choice of the French language for the young Belgian nation seemed natural, as French- speaking citizens formed the majority of the revolutionaries and was a language spoken by the aristocracy across the country.

Audi was one of the last German manufacturers to employ airbags in their cars, mainly due to the high reliability and cost-effectiveness of the technology they trademarked as \\"procon-ten\\". The procon-ten system used thick cables, similar to winch cables, running around the rear of the engine, and linked to it. In the event of a frontal impact, the force and momentum of the impact would shift the engine rearwards, tensioning and 'pulling' the cables, which were in turn connected to the steering column and seat belt mounts. When the cable was pulled tight by the engine, the cables would pull the steering wheel towards the front of the car, clear of the driver, and also remove any slack in the seat belts, holding the occupants more firmly in their seats until the accident had finished. Audi engines are by tradition mounted longitudinally, in front of the front wheels, as opposed to transverse, with but a few exceptions in more recent models. This meant the engine was close to the front bumper, (especially on 5 cylinder variants) that the radiator often had to be offset to halfway down one side of the engine bay. One advantage of this technique is that the engine is one of the first things to be struck in a frontal impact, taking much of the force, and allowing for high responsiveness of the procon-ten system. The procon-ten system was available for cars such as the 100 / 200 and the V8, as well as the 80 / 90. It was discontinued in 1994, with the introduction of the new A4 and A8 series, and the 100-based Audi A6, all in 1994, for the 1995 model year.

Like all ships of the class (apart from ) she was named after an important part of the British Empire, namely the Commonwealth of Australia. Armed with a battery of four and four guns, she and her sister ships marked a significant advance in offensive power compared to earlier British battleship designs that did not carry the 9.2 in guns. Commonwealth was built at the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, and was laid down in June 1902, launched in May 1903, and completed in March 1905. After commissioning in March 1905, she served with the Atlantic Fleet until she was involved in a collision with HMS Albemarle in early 1907. While being repaired, she was transferred into what would become known as the Home Fleet. Following a reorganisation of the fleet in 1912, she, along with her sister ships formed the 3rd Battle Squadron, which served in the Mediterranean during the First Balkan War. The squadron returned to Britain in 1913 and remained there into 1914. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, the 3rd Battle Squadron was assigned to the Grand Fleet, with Commonwealth conducting operations around Scotland and the North Sea as part of the Northern Patrol. The 3rd Battle Squadron was also involved in patrols of the entire Grand Fleet, though it did not see action against German forces. In 1916, the squadron was detached to the Nore Command. In 1917, the Commonwealth was updated, the only ship of her class to receive technology equivalent to that of the dreadnoughts. She ended the war as a gunnery training ship, continuing in this role until February 1921, at which time she was decommissioned and disposed of. Design Left elevation and deck plan as depicted in Jane's Fighting Ships Following the development of pre-dreadnought type battleships carrying heavy secondary guns of diameter in the Italian Regia Marina and the United States Navy, the Royal Navy decided to build similar ships. Initial proposals called for a battleship equipped with eight guns to support the main battery, though under the direction of William Henry White, the Director of Naval Construction, these were replaced with four guns. The new ships, though based on the general type that had formed the basis of the preceding four battleship designs, marked the first significant change in the series. Like all late pre-dreadnoughts that entered service in the mid-1900s, Commonwealth was made almost instantaneously obsolescent by the commissioning of the all-big-gun in December 1906, armed with a battery of ten heavy guns compared to the typical four of most pre-dreadnoughts. Commonwealth was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The King Edward VII-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 777 officers and ratings. The King Edward VII-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by sixteen water-tube boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The King Edward VII-class ships had a top speed of from . Commonwealth had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. These were supported by a heavy secondary battery of four guns in four single turrets, two on each broadside. The ships also mounted ten 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to fourteen 12-pounder guns and fourteen 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with five torpedo tubes submerged in the hull; two were on each broadside, with the fifth in the stern. Commonwealth had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. The sides of her main battery turrets were also 8 to 12 in thick, atop 12 in barbettes, and the 9.2 turrets had sides. The casemate battery was protected with of armour plate. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history Pre-World War I HMS Commonwealth was built at Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Govan. She was laid down on 17 June 1902, was launched on 13 May 1903, and was completed in March 1905. Upon completion, HMS Commonwealth was delivered to Portsmouth Dockyard on 14 March, where she was placed in reserve. She went into full commission on 9 May at Devonport Dockyard for service in the Atlantic Fleet. She collided with the battleship near Lagos on 11 February 1907, sustaining hull and bulkhead damage; Albemarle suffered minor damage to her bow. She began repairs at Devonport Dockyard later that month. While under repair, Commonwealth transferred to the Channel Fleet in March, recommissioning for actual service with that fleet on 28 May after completion of her repairs. She suffered another mishap in August when she ran aground, and was under repair at Devonport Dockyard until October. Under a fleet reorganization on 24 March 1909, the Channel Fleet became the 2nd Division, Home Fleet, and Commonwealth became a Home Fleet unit in that division. She underwent a refit at Devonport from October 1910 to June 1911. As a result of another fleet reorganization in May 1912, Commonwealth and all seven of her sisters (, , , , , , and ) were assigned to form the 3rd Battle Squadron, assigned to the Home Fleet. The squadron was detached to the Mediterranean in November because of the First Balkan War (October 1912 ‚Äì May 1913); it arrived at Malta on 27 November and subsequently participated in a blockade by an international force of Montenegro and an occupation of Scutari. The squadron returned to the United Kingdom in 1913 and rejoined the Home Fleet on 27 June. World War I Map of the North Sea Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the 3rd Battle Squadron, at the time under the command of Vice Admiral Edward Bradford, was assigned to the Grand Fleet and based at Rosyth, where it was reinforced with the five s, It was used to supplement the Grand Fleet's cruisers on the Northern Patrol. On 6 August, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, elements of the Grand Fleet sortied to inspect the coast of Norway in search of a German naval base violating Norwegian neutrality. Commonwealth and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron provided distant support to the operation. No such base was found, and the ships returned to port the next day. On 14 August, the ships of the Grand Fleet went to sea for battle practice before conducting a sweep into the North Sea later that day and into 15 August. During sweeps by the fleet, she and her sisters often steamed at the heads of divisions of the far more valuable dreadnoughts, where they could protect the dreadnoughts by watching for mines or by being the first to strike them. On 2 November 1914, the squadron was detached to reinforce the Channel Fleet and was rebased at Portland. It returned to the Grand Fleet on 13 November 1914. On 14 December, the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, 2nd Battle Squadron, and accompanying cruisers and destroyers left port to intercept the German forces preparing to raid Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. On the first reports of contact with German units on the morning of 16 December, the Grand Fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe, ordered Bradford to take the 3rd Battle Squadron to support the ships in contact at 10:00. Four hours later, they met the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons, en route from Scapa Flow, though they failed to reach the German High Seas Fleet before the latter withdrew. The Grand Fleet remained at sea until late on 17 December, at which point the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered back to Rosyth. Commonwealth and the rest of the squadron joined the Grand Fleet for another sweep into the North Sea on 25 December. The fleet returned to its ports two days later, having failed to locate any German vessels. Commonwealth thereafter went into dry dock for a refit that lasted until February 1915. Commonwealth returned to the 3rd Battle Squadron in February 1915. Elements of the Grand Fleet went to sea repeatedly over the next few months. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the central North Sea in company with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron from 10 to 13 March. The two units again went to sea to sweep the central North Sea from 5 to 8 April. A major fleet operation followed on 11 April, with the entire Grand Fleet sortieing for a sweep of the North Sea on 12 and 13 April. The squadrons returned to their ports on 14 April to replenish their fuel. Another such operation followed on 17 April, which also failed to find any German ships. The 3rd Battle Squadron returned to Rosyth late on 18 April. The fleet sortied again on 21 April, returning to port two days later. The 3rd Battle Squadron, joined by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the northern North Sea from 5 to 10 May, during which a German U-boat attacked the battleships but failed to score a hit. Another sweep into the North Sea took place on 17‚Äì19 May, and no German forces were encountered. The fleet went to sea again on 29 May for a patrol south to the Dogger Bank before returning to port on 31 May, again without having located any German vessels. The Grand Fleet spent much of June in port conducting training, but the most modern units went to sea on 11 June for gunnery practice to the northwest of Shetland. While they were training, Commonwealth and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron, along with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the central North Sea. Fleet activities were limited in July, owing to a threatened strike by coal miners, which began on 18 July and threatened the supply of coal for the fleet's ships. The strike continued into August, which led Jellicoe to continue to limit fleet activities to preserve his stocks of coal. Australian soldiers touring HMS Commonwealth in 1919 The fleet saw little activity in September, and during this period, the Grand Fleet began to go to sea without the 3rd Battle Squadron. On 29 April 1916, the 3rd Battle Squadron was rebased at Sheerness, and on 3 May 1916 it was separated from the Grand Fleet, being transferred to the Nore Command. Commonwealth remained there with the squadron until August 1917. Commonwealth left the 3rd Battle Squadron in August 1917 and paid off to undergo an extensive refit at Portsmouth Dockyard, during which she became the only King Edward VII-class ship fitted with updated features common among dreadnoughts, including torpedo bulges, a tripod foremast, and a director and fire control system; she also had her 6-inch gun batteries removed and four 6-inch guns installed one deck higher. When her refit was completed in April 1918, she was in effect the most advanced pre-dreadnought battleship in the world. She recommissioned on 16 April 1918 for service on the Northern Patrol, then transferred to the Grand Fleet on 21 August 1918, where she made full use of her updated equipment in service as a seagoing gunnery training ship based at Invergordon. After three years of this service as a training ship, Commonwealth paid off in February 1921. She was placed on the disposal list at Portsmouth Dockyard in April 1921 and was sold to Slough Trading Company for scrapping on 18 November 1921. She then was resold to German scrappers and towed to Germany to be broken up.

The two forms of energy forestry are short rotation coppice and short rotation forestry: *Short rotation coppice may include tree crops of poplar, willow or eucalyptus, grown for two to five years before harvest. *Short rotation forestry are crops of alder, ash, birch, eucalyptus, poplar, and sycamore, grown for eight to 20 years before harvest. Benefits The main advantage of using \\"grown fuels\\", as opposed to fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil, is that while they are growing they absorb the near-equivalent in carbon dioxide (an important greenhouse gas) to that which is later released in their burning. In comparison, burning fossil fuels increases atmospheric carbon unsustainably, by using carbon that was added to the Earth's carbon sink millions of years ago. This is a prime contributor to climate change. According to the FAO, compared to other energy crops, wood is among the most efficient sources of bioenergy in terms of quantity of energy released by unit of carbon emitted. Other advantages of generating energy from trees, as opposed to agricultural crops, are that trees do not have to be harvested each year, the harvest can be delayed when market prices are down, and the products can fulfil a variety of end-uses. Yields of some varieties can be as high as 12 oven dry tonnes every year. However, commercial experience on plantations in Scandinavia have shown lower yield rates. These crops can also be used in bank stabilisation and phytoremediation. In fact, experiments in Sweden with willow plantations have proved to have many beneficial effects on the soil and water quality when compared to conventional agricultural crops (such as cereal). Problems Although in many areas of the world government funding is still required to support large scale development of energy forestry as an industry, it is seen as a valuable component of the renewable energy network and will be increasingly important in the future. Growing trees is relatively water intensive. The system of energy forestry has faced criticism over food vs. fuel, whereby it has become financially profitable to replace food crops with energy crops. It has to be noted, however, that such energy forests do not necessarily compete with food crops for highly productive land as they can be grown on slopes, marginal, or degraded land as well - sometimes even with long-term restoration purposes in mind.

Methods shown in the show Spray-on hair The first method shown in the programme was 'Spray-on Hair' which was used by a 28-year-old man called Russell. The product is a coloured hair spray which is applied to existing hair follicles making them appear thicker, covering up thinning and bald patches.

Its origins lie with Carl Linnaeus who used the word when he referred to natural groups of plants in his lesser-known work, particularly Philosophia Botanica. In his more famous works the Systema Naturae and the Species Plantarum, plants were arranged according to his artificial \\"Sexual system\\", and Linnaeus used the word \\"ordo\\" for an artificial unit. In those works, only genera and species (sometimes varieties) were \\"real\\" taxa. In nineteenth-century works such as the Prodromus of de Candolle and the Genera Plantarum of Bentham & Hooker, the word ordo did indicate taxa that are now given the rank of family. Contemporary French works used the word \\"famille\\" for these same taxa. In the first international Rules of botanical nomenclature of 1906 the word family (familia) was assigned to this rank, while the term \\"order\\" (ordo) was reserved for a higher rank, for what in the nineteenth century had often been named a cohors (plural cohortes). The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants provides for names published in the rank of ordo naturalis in Art 18.2: normally, these are to be accepted as family names. Article 18.2 Some plant families retain the name they were given by pre-Linnaean authors, recognised by Linnaeus as \\"natural orders\\" (e.g. Palmae or Labiatae). Such names are known as descriptive family names.

The program features contemporary and classical music, dance, theatre, opera, visual arts, large-scale public works. The main events of the festival take place every year from February to March, with the Perth Writers Festival (rebranded with other names over time) occurring in February, while the film festival now known as Lotterywest Films runs from November to April, as part of the Perth Festival. The event is based mainly at the University of Western Australia, with several events taking place at outdoor venues at UWA, but some events take place elsewhere. The festival is run by UWA in partnership with the state government and the Perth City Council. From 2004, the Festival carried Lotterywest branding, and Lotterywest was acknowledged as the Festival's \\"principal partner\\". The artistic director for 2020 to 2023 is Iain Grandage. History South Perth Foreshore, March 2007 The festival was created in 1953 by the University of Western Australia, making it the oldest international arts festival in Australia, and the oldest annual international multi-arts festival in the southern hemisphere. The founder of the festival was a then UWA professor, Fred Alexander, Director of Adult Education, who was inspired by attending the Edinburgh Festival in 1951. Alexander's aim was \\"to offer the best cultural events that are available from British, European, American, Asian and Australian sources\\". The first festival, held in 1953, showcased theatre, ballet and film, drawing an audience of 42,000 people despite little publicity. It was held over the summer school holidays in January, for Summer School students, arranged by John Birman as a more formal extension of his previous summer school programmes. Series page In 1964, the Shakespeare's 400th anniversary, the New Fortune Theatre opened in the Arts Building, then the only replica of the 1599 London Fortune Playhouse. Another notable anniversary for the festival were its 21st anniversary coinciding with the opening of the Perth Concert Hall, and in 1979 festival it celebrated the 150th anniversary of the founding of the colony in 1829. In 1987 the festival opened at the same time as the final races of the America's Cup yacht race. The festival expanded off-campus citywide in the 1960s, and by 1980 had hugely increased its audience, with an increase of 300 percent in paid attendances between 1976 and 1980. Some sources refer to it as the Festival of Perth in the 1980s. The festival broadened its appeal, in 1999 the newly-appointed artistic director, S√©an Doran, announced a change of name to the Perth International Arts Festival, leading up to its 50th anniversary in 2003. In 2004, the festival started carrying the Lotterywest branding, and Lotterywest was referred to as its \\"principal partner\\" in all communications. With new artistic director Lindy Hume and a new four-year strategic plan, there was a significant shift in direction for the festival: towards increased community involvement, and developing stronger partnerships with local arts organisations and regional centres. The branding was changed to simply \\"Perth Festival\\" by then director Wendy Martin and the board in 2018, although the registered company name was still Perth International Arts Festival, as \\"the organiser of Perth Festival\\".

Writers Festival  Earlier Perth Festivals had poetry and literature as a component of the larger festival. By the 1990s the Perth Writers Festival was titled and marketed separately, for some time known as the Alcoa Perth Writers Festival (named after its sponsor, Alcoa). By the 2000s the Writers Festival was well recognised by publishers from interstate and overseas. Keynote speakers and featured authors since then have included notable writers from Australia and overseas, such as Germaine Greer, Hilary Mantel, Ahdaf Soueif (2013 opener), Ben Okri, Esi Edugyan and Chloe Hooper. It retained the branding as Perth Writers Festival, taking place for three days over a weekend, until it was extended to a run for a full week in 2018, when it changed to Perth Writers Week. It took place not only at the University Club of Western Australia, but also in public libraries, in bars and on the streets of the city. This continued in 2019. In 2020 the programme was pared back to a weekend, and marketed as the Perth Festival's Literature & Ideas Weekend. The Literature & Ideas curator was author Sisonke Msimang. Film festival 1953‚Äì1985 Films formed part of the Perth Festival's offerings since its inception in January 1953, being shown at the Somerville Auditorium at UWA. The first artistic director, John Birman, introduced many foreign films to an audience used to Hollywood fare, and there was resistance at first. In 1957 a French film festival was held, and in 1959 the festival became for Birman \\"the establishment of an international film festival within the festival\\". Until at least 1985, the festival was not a \\"proper film festival\\" like Sydney and Melbourne film festivals were, in that it did not bring new films into Australia, flown in and out for the event ‚Äì but they brought in enough enough revenue subsidise other events, especially the performing arts. The Festival of Perth, along with the Adult Education Board of UWA, thus became distributors and exhibitors of foreign films, sometimes featuring an Australian premiere. From 1972 to 1976, the Perth International Film Festival was run by David Roe and Sylvie Le Clezio, and focussed on independent films, including the work of Werner Herzog, Jean Eustache, Thomas Koerfer, Claude Faraldo, Peter von Gunten, Alexander Kluge, Thierry Zeno, Shuji Terayama, and others. Some of the choices were bold and generated discussions about film censorship, such as Zeno's Vase de Noces and Nagisa ≈åshima's In the Realm of the Senses. It also showcased new Australian cinema, such as The Adventures of Barry McKenzie by Bruce Beresford and The Singer by Gillian Armstrong. It started showing films at suburban cinemas, and funding became a problem. The 1977 festival was cancelled after the WA Government refused to subsidise the event. Programmes from the first, second and fifth festivals (and various others which may be related to the Festival of Perth) are held in the State Library of Western Australia. The Perth Institute for Film and TV (PIFT, later renamed Film and Television Institute (FTI), and from May 2017 amalgamated with ScreenWest) took over the management of the film festival, although only hosting its first full-scale first-release event in 1980, dubbing it the Indian Ocean Film Festival and introducing more Asian films. However, this was not a success, partly because of poor marketing. David Blenkinsop, taking over the reins of the Perth Festival in 1977, had a bigger budget to work with, and along with Sherry Hopkins, brought in a system whereby a committee would preview all films before deciding whether to include them in the film festival. Audiences rose from 21,000 in 1977 to 65,000 in 1985, but the festival was no longer bringing new films into the country, leaving that to Sydney and Melbourne. It did, however, make the Festival of Perth unique, being the only arts festival that had a successful film festival attached to it. 1986 to present With the Lotterywest rebranding and its acknowledgement as \\"principal partner\\" of PIAF in 2004, it was in this year that the film component took on the title of Lotterywest Film Festival, Lotterywest Festival Films, and variants. In 2010, Madeleine Bates, was appointed to the role of Program Manager: Film, after being head of film screenings at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. and for some years previously, the film festival part of the Perth Festival is known as Lotterywest Films. The film manager is Tom Vincent. Funding The festival was founded by and has operated from the University of Western Australia Nedlands campus since 1953. The University of Western Australia further supports the festival through the provision of services and resources. Lotterywest has supported the festival financially since 1992. The festival also relies on corporate sponsors and partnerships for funding, with new organisations becoming involved each year. Corporate partners La Fura dels Baus display at the 2010 opening night Driving into Walls dress-rehearsal, February 2012 Royal de Luxe: The Incredible and Phenomenal Journey of the Giants to the Streets of Perth, 2015 The array of corporate partners changes each year, however some partners have committed to long term sponsorship of the festival.

The opening of the festival featured a 'DAWN:DUSK' opening, where hundreds of people gathered on Cottesloe Beach to watch vocalists and musicians. The festival was held from 10 February to 4 March, and was the first year led by new artistic director, Jonathan Holloway. A number of events sold out during this year's festival, including tickets to Bon Iver. 2013 festival The 2013 festival was held from 8 February to 2 March. With 750 artists, 820 events and 250 film screenings, it is the biggest yet. This year marked the announcement of a new significant partner, Chevron Corporation. This partnership was recognised through the renaming of the Festival Gardens to Chevron Festival Gardens.

A time and attendance system enables an employer to monitor their employees working hours and late arrivals, early departures, time taken on breaks and absenteeism. It also helps to control labor costs by reducing over-payments, which are often caused by paying employees for time that are not working, and eliminates transcription error, interpretation error and intentional error. TNA systems can also be used to ensure compliance with labor regulations regarding proof of attendance.  Manual systems  Traditionally manual systems were used that rely on paper cards which have times stamped onto them using a time stamping machine. Such machines were used for over a century but have since been phased out and replaced with cheaper automated systems which eliminate the need for payroll staff to manually input employee hours.  Automated systems  Modern automated time and attendance systems require employees to touch or swipe to identify themselves and record their working hours as they enter or leave the work area. Originally this consisted of using a RFID electronic tag or a barcode badge but these have been replaced by biometrics (vein reader, hand geometry, fingerprint, or facial recognition), and touch screens devices.

There are several Reactomes that concentrate on specific organisms, the largest of these is focused on human biology, the following description concentrates on the human Reactome. It is authored by expert biologists, in collaboration with Reactome editorial staff who are all PhD level biologists. Content is cross-referenced to many bioinformatics databases. The rationale behind Reactome is to visually represent biological pathways in full mechanistic detail, while making the source data available in a computationally accessible format. The website can be used to browse pathways and submit data to a suite of data analysis tools. The underlying data is fully downloadable in a number of standard formats including PDF, SBML and BioPAX. Pathway diagrams use a Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)-based style. The core unit of the Reactome data model is the reaction. Entities (nucleic acids, proteins, complexes and small molecules) participating in reactions form a network of biological interactions and are grouped into pathways. Examples of biological pathways in Reactome include signaling, innate and acquired immune function, transcriptional regulation, translation, apoptosis and classical intermediary metabolism. The pathways represented in Reactome are species-specific, with each pathway step supported by literature citations that contain an experimental verification of the process represented. If no experimental verification using human reagents exists, pathways may contain steps manually inferred from non-human experimental details, but only if an expert biologist, named as Author of the pathway, and a second biologist, names as reviewer, agree that this is a valid inference to make. The human pathways are used to computationally generate by an orthology-based process derived pathways in other organisms. Database organization In Reactome, human biological processes are annotated by breaking them down into series of molecular events. Like classical chemistry reactions each Reactome event has input physical entities (substrates) which interact, possibly facilitated by enzymes or other molecular catalysts, to generate output physical entities (products). Reactions include the classical chemical interconversions of intermediary metabolism, binding events, complex formation, transport events that direct molecules between cellular compartments, and events such as the activation of a protein by cleavage of one or more of its peptide bonds. Individual events can be grouped together into pathways. Physical entities can be small molecules like glucose or ATP, or large molecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins, encoded directly or indirectly in the human genome. Physical entities are cross-referenced to relevant external databases, such as UniProt for proteins and ChEBI for small molecules. Localization of molecules to subcellular compartments is a key feature of the regulation of human biological processes, so molecules in the Reactome database are associated with specific locations. Thus in Reactome instances of the same chemical entity in different locations (e.g., extracellular glucose and cytosolic glucose) are treated as distinct chemical entities. The Gene Ontology controlled vocabularies are used to describe the subcellular locations of molecules and reactions, molecular functions, and the larger biological processes that a specific reaction is part of. Database content The database contains curated annotations that cover a diverse set of topics in molecular and cellular biology. Details of current and future annotation projects can be found in the calendar of annotation projects. Topics of annotation include; * cell cycle * metabolism * signaling * transport * cell motility * immune function * host-virus interaction * neural function Tools There are tools on the website for viewing an interactive pathway diagram, performing pathway mapping and pathway over-representation analysis and for overlaying expression data onto Reactome pathways. The pathway mapping and over-representation tools take a single column of protein/compound identifiers, Uniprot and ChEBI accessions are preferred but the interface will accept and interpret many other identifiers or symbols. Mixed identifiers can be used. Over-representation results are presented as a list of statistically over-represented pathways (note that the default view only shows the major pathway topics, which may not be the most significant, click on the Open All button to see the subpathways). Expression data is submitted in a multi-column format, the first column identifying the protein, additional columns are expected to be numeric expression values, they can in fact be any numeric value, e.g. differential expression, quantitative proteomics, GWAS scores. The expression data is represented as colouring of the corresponding proteins in pathway diagrams, using the colours of the visible spectrum so 'hot' red colours represent high values. If multiple columns of numeric data are submitted the overlay tool can display them as separate 'experiments', e.g. timepoints or a disease progression. The database can be browsed and searched as an on-line textbook. An on-line users' guide is available.

Early years The son of a professor, Brecher began studying philosophy in 1900 at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. He did not finish his studies, deciding instead to become an actor.  Career  He appeared on several provincial stages in Germany and Austria until 1910, and then played in Vienna on various occasions, directed by Josef Jarno until 1921. In 1907, he founded an initiative (which lasted for one or two years) to play modern Yiddish theatre in German language with Siegfried Schmitz and members of the student club ‚ÄòTheodor Herzl‚Äô like Hugo Zuckermann and Oskar Rosenfeld. In 1919 he was a co- founder, along with Isaak Deutsch, Jacob Mestel, and others, of the Freie J√ºdische Volksb√ºhne in Vienna, a Yiddish theatre, which existed until 1922.Dienstl, Theresa (2013). \\"J√ºdisches Theater in Wien in den 1930er ‚Äì Vermittlung der j√ºdischen Identit√§t\\" [Jewish Theater in Vienna in the 1930s: Mediation of Jewish Identity.

In the latter half of the 1920s, he was stage director and leading man for the theatrical troupe headed by Eva Le Gallienne. He moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s to appear in foreign-language versions of American films. In the mid-1930s he appeared in classic horror films The Black Cat, Werewolf of London, The Black Room, Mark of the Vampire and The Devil-Doll, and worked steadily in the espionage films of the 1930s and 1940s, his Slavic accent landing him roles both noble and villainous. One of his largest screen roles was in 1946's So Dark the Night.  Death  Brecher died on 12 August 1946, aged 66, of a heart attack in Hollywood, California. He was buried in Beth Olam Cemetery in Hollywood.

Nemmersdorf (present-day Mayakovskoye, Kaliningrad Oblast) was one of the first pre-war ethnic German villages to fall to the advancing Red Army in World War II. On 21 October 1944, Soviet soldiers reportedly killed many German civilians as well as French and Belgian POWs. Incident The 2nd Battalion, 25th Guards Tank Brigade, belonging to the 2nd Guards Tank Corps of the 11th Guards Army, crossed the Angerapp bridge and established a bridgehead on the western bank of the Rominte river on 21 October 1944. German forces tried to retake the bridge, but several attacks were repelled by the Soviet tanks and the supporting infantry. During an air attack, a number of Soviet soldiers took shelter in an improvised bunker already occupied by 14 local men and women. According to the testimony of a seriously injured woman, Gerda Meczulat, when a Soviet officer arrived and ordered everybody out, the Russians shot and killed the German civilians at close range. During the night, the Soviet 25th Tank Brigade was ordered to retreat back across the river and take defensive positions along the Rominte. The Wehrmacht regained control of Nemmersdorf and discovered the massacre. Evidence Nazi Germany authorities organized an international commission to investigate, headed by Estonian Hjalmar M√§e and other representatives of neutral countries, such as Francoist Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The commission heard the report from a medical commission. It reported that all the dead females had been raped (they ranged in age from 8 to 84). The Nazi Propaganda Ministry (separately) used the V√∂lkischer Beobachter and the cinema news series Wochenschau to accuse the Soviet Army of having killed dozens of civilians at Nemmersdorf and having summarily executed about 50 French and Belgian noncombatant POWs, who had been ordered to take care of thoroughbred horses but had been blocked by the bridge. The civilians were allegedly killed by blows with shovels or gun butts. The former chief of staff of the German Fourth Army, Major General Erich Dethleffsen, testified on 5 July 1946 before an American tribunal in Neu-Ulm. He said: Karl Potrek of K√∂nigsberg, leader of a Volkssturm company present when the German Army took back the village, testified in a 1953 report: At the time, the Nazi Propaganda Ministry disseminated a graphic description of the events in order to fanaticise German soldiers.Samuel, Wolfgang. \\"War on the Ground\\", The War of Our Childhood: Memories of World War II, University of Mississippi Press; . On the home front, civilians reacted immediately, with an increase in the number of volunteers joining the Volkssturm.Thorwald, J√ºrgen. Wielka ucieczka (Gro√üe Flucht). Krak√≥w: Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1998; . A larger number of civilians responded with panic, and started to leave the area en masse. To many Germans, \\"Nemmersdorf\\" became a symbol of war crimes committed by the Red Army, and an example of the worst behavior in Eastern Germany. Marion Gr√§fin D√∂nhoff, the post-war co-publisher of the weekly Die Zeit, at the time of the reports lived in the village of Quittainen (Kwitany) in western East Prussia, near Preussisch Holland (Pas≈Çƒôk). She wrote in 1962 that: Re-investigation After 1991 and the fall of the Soviet Union, new sources became available and the dominant view among scholars became that the massacre was embellished, and actually exploited, by Goebbels in an attempt to stir up civilian resistance to the advancing Soviet Army. Bernhard Fisch, in his book, Nemmersdorf, October 1944. What actually happened in East Prussia concluded that liberties were taken with at least some of the photographs; that some victims on the photographs were from other East Prussian villages, and that the notorious crucifixion barn doors were not even in Nemmersdorf. There also was the tight time schedule of witness Joachim Reisch, reducing the Soviet presence at Nemmersdorf to less than four hours of heavy fighting in front of the bridge.Fisch, Bernhard.

Another writer, Joachim Reisch, claimed to have personally been at the scene of the bridge when the event was supposed to have occurred. He has said that the Soviet Brigade was on the bridge for less than four hours.Joachim Reisch testimony, schuka.net; accessed 7 December 2014.Reisch, Joachim.

Sir Ian Kershaw is among those historians who believe that the Soviet forces committed a massacre at Nemmersdorf, although details and numbers are disputed.Kershaw, Sir Ian, The End, 2012, Penguin Books, pp. 111-17. The German Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv) contain many contemporary reports and photographs by officials of Nazi Germany of the victims of the Nemmersdorf massacre. It holds evidence of other Soviet massacres in East Prussia, notably Metgethen. In the late 20th century, Alfred de Zayas interviewed numerous German soldiers and officers who had been in the Nemmersdorf area in October 1944, to learn what they saw. He also interviewed Belgian and French POWs who had been in the area and fled with German civilians before the Russian advance. De Zayas incorporated these sources into two of his own books, Nemesis at Potsdam and A Terrible Revenge.

Born in Clazomenae, Florus was appointed to replace Lucceius Albinus as procurator by the Emperor Nero due to his wife Cleopatra's friendship with Nero's wife Poppaea. He was noted for his tensions against the Judean and Jewish population, and is credited by Josephus as being the primary cause of the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War. Upon taking office in Caesarea, Florus began favoring local Greek population of the city over the Jewish population. The local Greek population noticed Florus' policies and took advantage of the circumstances. One notable instance of provocation occurred while the Jews were worshiping at their local synagogue and a Hellenist sacrificed several birds on top of an earthenware container at the entrance of the synagogue, an act that rendered the building ritually unclean. In response to this action, the Jews sent a group of men to petition Florus for redress. Despite accepting a payment of eight talents to hear the case, Florus refused to listen to the complaints and instead had the petitioners imprisoned. Florus further angered the Jewish population of his province by having seventeen talents removed from the treasury of the Temple in Jerusalem, claiming the money was for the Emperor. In response to this action, the city fell into unrest and some of the Jewish population began to openly mock Florus by passing a basket around to collect money as if Florus were poor. Florus reacted to the unrest by sending soldiers into Jerusalem the next day to raid the city and arrest a number of the city leaders. The arrested individuals were whipped and crucified despite many of them being Roman citizens. After the outbreak of the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War, Florus was replaced as procurator by Marcus Antonius Julianus.

The current roll is around 1,295 students, with around 280 of those in the sixth form.Number of pupils at Cardiff schools (NOR) as at 26 September 2017, Cardiff Council, accessed 6 February 2018 The school is controlled by the Cardiff Education Authority.Report of Inspection 26‚Äì30 April 2004, Estyn\\"Education\\" , Radyr and Morganstown Community, accessed 14 July 2008 For the 2000-01 school year, demand for places from parents exceeded supply.School Decisions Committee, Cardiff Council, 8 May 2001 History A view of the school Prior to 1968, the majority of children from Radyr travelled nine miles to Penarth County Grammar School and St Cyres Secondary Modern School in Penarth by steam train daily, a quicker and easier option than road journeys to closer Cardiff secondary schools. The arrangement ceased when the direct rail route was closed by the Beeching Axe. The new Radyr Comprehensive School opened in 1972. In 2004, a new state-of-the-art sports hall, including a fitness suite, was built for the school. In June 2007, the school site was said to be worth ¬£25m, and it was reported by the South Wales Echo that Cardiff Council were considering plans to close the school as part of a reorganisation. The school was criticised, in February 2008, after pupils aged 13 were instructed by a teacher to write imaginary suicide notes for an English lesson in order to \\"get into the mind of a troubled teenager\\". This was part of a study of the non-curriculum novel Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman. However, the school is just a few miles from Bridgend where there had been multiple teenage suicides. The headmaster of the school stated that \\"the task was a 'spontaneous piece of writing' where children were asked not to turn over the page to find out what the letter said - but to write their own version of the suicide note\\" and \\"the teacher setting the text did not associate the task with news stories but considered it part of the textual study of a serious book dealing with serious issues in a serious way\\". Several relatives of the recently deceased Bridgend teenagers expressed their sorrow and regret that the unsuitable subject featured in a school project for such young children.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1579913/Students-asked-to- write-suicide-notes-in-class.html Academic performance The proportion of pupils who achieved five or more grades A* to C in the 2003 GCSE examinations was above the national average, whilst the proportion of students achieving A level success at grades A to C in 2 or more subjects was below the national average. In summer 2007, over 95 per cent of the school's students achieved at least 5 A*-C GCSE grades, the highest yet. However, in the last Estyn inspection in April 2004, the standards reached in Religious Education at Key Stage 4 were considered unsatisfactory, but the remaining assessments ranged between satisfactory and very good, with notable performances in Art, Music, and Physical Education.

The Big Band in 2011, were invited back to Disneyland Paris and performed again, this time at the Videopolis (Disneyland Paris) stage. The school's Green Flag Committee ensure that the school remains loyal to its eco-friendly policy, as set down in late 2008 following the granting of emergency powers to the Committee in order to deal with what was perceived as an imminent threat to the school's environmental well-being. The main objective was to aid the school in achieving the \\"Eco Schools Green Flag Award\\"; the Committee leads by example and tolerates neither litterers nor other undesirable elements. The school currently holds the silver award in the scheme, and is now aiming to achieve the award itself. In accordance with this, the Green Flag committee is affiliated with the Radyr and Morganstown Association. The RGFC has taken proceedings one step further recently, by taking on the duties of providing extra care to Radyr Railway Station as part of the Arriva Trains Wales adopt a station scheme.

Its objective is to \\"challenge present and future leaders to solve issues of global concern\\" through programs held at Schloss Leopoldskron, in Salzburg, Austria, and in other locations throughout the world. It has hosted more than 500 sessions, consisting of more than 30,000 participants from 169 countries, since its establishment in 1947. Organizational history In 1946, Clemens Heller, a native Austrian attending graduate school at Harvard University, \\"envisioned a cultural bridge spanning the Atlantic not only by introducing the demoralized Europeans to all sorts of American cultural achievements, but also by stimulating a fruitful exchange between European national cultures and America.\\" Richard \\"Dick\\" Campbell Jr., an undergraduate student and Scott Elledge, an English instructor also at Harvard, became allies in the realization of this project. Though Harvard was unwilling to support the project, they were able to convince the Harvard Student Council to be the official sponsors of the Seminar. The three founders raised the majority of funds. It was also necessary for the trio to obtain permission from the State Department for entrance into Allied Occupied Austria. Legend contends that in 1947, Heller bumped into Helene Thimig on a subway train in New York. The widow of theater producer Max Reinhardt had been friends with Heller's parents before the war and had a summer home in Salzburg named Schloss Leopoldskron. Schloss Leopoldskron Heller explained his plans and Thimig said she would rent Max‚Äôs Schloss at a low rate for the purpose of a summer school. Dick Campbell is quoted as saying \\"We hope to create at least one small center in which young Europeans from all countries, and of all political convictions, could meet for a month in concrete work under favorable living conditions, and to lay the foundation for a possible permanent center of intellectual discussion in Europe.\\" The first session, officially called \\"The Harvard Student Council's Salzburg Seminar in American Civilization,\\" lasted six weeks in the summer of 1947 and brought together men and women from eighteen countries, including countries from behind the Iron Curtain. Faculty for the first session included literary historian F. O. Matthiessen; anthropologist Margaret Mead; economists Walt Rostow and Wassily Leontief; writer and literary critic Alfred Kazin among others. The Seminar was formally incorporated on April 20, 1950. Dexter Perkins, Frederick Muhlhauser, Herbert Gleason, Clyde and Florence Kluckhohn, Wassily Leontief and Richard Campbell all signed the papers of the Salzburg Seminar in American Studies. By 1950, the Seminar developed into more than a summer school and session topics were expanded beyond American Studies. During President Tuthill‚Äôs second year, he told the Board that in 1979 \\"American Law would be the only ‚ÄòAmerican‚Äô subject offered.\\" The Seminar had become so global in focus, that he twice urged that the Seminar be renamed \\"Salzburg Seminar in International Studies.\\" In 2007, the Seminar changed its name to the Salzburg Global Seminar in order to better reflect the increasingly global, rather than American, outlook of the Seminar and the focus of its course offerings. Although the Seminar grew to include a more global focus, American Studies themes continued to be present at Salzburg Global Seminar. In 1994, the Seminar returned to its roots by establishing the American Studies Center. From 1994 to 2002 thirty-two sessions on American themes were held. In 2003 the Salzburg Seminar American Studies Association (SSASA) was created. SSASA organizes a yearly symposium devoted to a broad American Studies theme such as politics, literature, history or cultural studies. Today, Salzburg Global Seminar holds sessions that focus \\"on critical issues confronting the global community, covering topics as diverse as health care and education, culture and economics, geopolitics and philanthropy... Seminars are designed to be participatory: prompting candid dialogue, fresh thinking and constantly in the search for innovative but practical solutions.\\" Home of the Salzburg Global Seminar Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg Count Leopold Anton Eleutherius von Firmian (1679-1744) commissioned Schloss Leopoldskron in 1736. The chapel of Leopoldskron was consecrated in 1744. Archbishop von Firmian handed the Fideikommiss charter to his nephew, Lakantz, Count of Firmian. The Archbishop died in October 1744, and was buried in the Salzburg's cathedral while his heart was interred in Leopoldskron's chapel. The Schloss remained in the possession of the Firmian family until 1837. It was then sold to the owner of a local shooting gallery, George Zierer, who stripped the palace of most of its valuable interior decorations, including paintings, etchings, and sculptures. The Schloss had several owners during the 19th century (including two waiters who wanted to use it as a hotel, ex-King Ludwig I of Bavaria and a banker) until it was bought in 1918 by the famous theatre director Max Reinhardt, co-founder of the Salzburg Festival.Max Reinhardt During World War II the Schloss was confiscated as Jewish property. After the war, and Max Reinhardt's death, the Schloss was returned to the Reinhardt Estate. After two quick sales, first to a bank and then the City of Salzburg, Schloss Leopoldskron was sold to the \\"Salzburg Seminar in American Studies\\" in 1959. The purchase price of the Schloss and 17 acres was \\"$77,000, plus $10,500 in solicitors' fees.\\" In 1973 the adjacent Meierhof, a part of the original Firmian estate, was also purchased by the Seminar. In 2014, the Meierhof underwent a substantial two-month renovation which incorporated the 18th century style of the Schloss. For instance, the headboards were crafted from historic shutters. In addition, three rooms were created to reference the 1965 movie \\"The Sound of Music\\" which was filmed, in part, on the Schloss grounds. In addition to being the home of Salzburg Global Seminar, the Schloss Leopoldskron and the Meierhof now operate as a fully functioning hotel.

American neurobiologists Elizabeth Parker, Larry Cahill, and James McGaugh (2006) identified two defining characteristics of hyperthymesia: spending an excessive amount of time thinking about one's past, and displaying an extraordinary ability to recall specific events from one's past. The word \\"hyperthymesia\\" derives from Ancient Greek: hyper- (\\"excessive\\") and thymesis (\\"remembering\\"). Signs and symptoms Individuals with hyperthymesia can extensively recall the events of their lives, as well as public events that hold some personal significance to them. Those affected describe their memories as uncontrollable associations; when they encounter a date, they \\"see\\" a vivid depiction of that day in their heads without hesitation or conscious effort. While memories are reported as vivid, they are not exact recordings of all experiences, as seen in the case of AJ: > Although she describes her mind like having a movie running, she is not > recording her world verbatim in its totality. One day after several hours > together, she was asked to close her eyes and tell what her two interviewers > were wearing. She was unable to do so. There is a distinction between those with hyperthymesia and those with other forms of exceptional memory, who generally use mnemonic or similar rehearsal strategies to memorize long strings of information. Memories recalled by hyperthymestic individuals tend to be personal, autobiographical accounts of both significant and mundane events in their lives. This extensive and highly unusual memory does not derive from the use of mnemonic strategies; it is encoded involuntarily and retrieved automatically. Despite perhaps being able to remember the day of the week on which a particular date fell, hyperthymestics are not calendrical calculators, like some people with savant syndrome. Rather, hyperthymestic recall tends to be constrained to a person's lifetime and is believed to be a subconscious process. Although people showing a high level of hyperthymesia are not regarded as autistic, certain similarities exist between the two conditions. Like autistic savants, some individuals with hyperthymesia may also have an unusual and obsessive interest in dates. Russian psychologist Alexander Luria documented the famous case of mnemonist Solomon Shereshevsky, who was quite different from the first documented hyperthymestic known as AJ (real name Jill Price) in that Shereshevsky could memorize virtually unlimited amounts of information deliberately, while AJ could not ‚Äì she could only remember autobiographical information (and events she had personally seen on the news or read about). In fact, she was not very good at memorizing anything at all, according to the study published in Neurocase. Hyperthymestic individuals appear to have poorer than average memory for arbitrary information. Another striking parallel drawn between the two cases was that Shereshevsky exemplified an interesting case of synesthesia and it has been suggested that superior autobiographical memory is intimately tied to time-space synesthesia. Difficulties Hyperthymestic abilities can have a detrimental effect. The constant, irrepressible stream of memories has caused significant disruption to AJ's life. She described her recollection as \\"non-stop, uncontrollable and totally exhausting\\" and as \\"a burden\\". AJ is prone to getting lost in remembering. This can make it difficult to attend to the present or future, as she is permanently living in the past. Others who have hyperthymesia do not display any of these traits, however. AJ displays considerable difficulty in memorizing allocentric information. \\"Her autobiographical memory, while incredible, is also selective and even ordinary in some respects,\\" ‚Äì McGaugh. This was demonstrated by AJ's poor performance on standardised memory tests. At school, AJ was an average student, unable to apply her exceptional memory to her studies. Deficits in executive functioning and anomalous lateralisation were also identified in AJ. These cognitive deficiencies are characteristic of frontostriatal disorders. Even those with a high level of hyperthymesia do not remember exactly everything in their lives or have \\"perfect memory\\". Studies have shown that it is a selective ability, as shown by AJ's case, and they can have comparative difficulty with rote memorization and therefore cannot apply their ability to school and work. Their memorization of events tends to exceed their ability to memorize given facts; for example, if you told a hyperthymesiac a fact about the world, they may not remember what you said, but they will more likely remember what you wore and other details of the situation when you told them. Causes Due to the small number of people diagnosed with hyperthymesia, relatively little is known about the processes governing this superior memory ability. However, more is beginning to be understood about this condition. Psychological It has been proposed that the initial encoding of events by such people includes semantic processing, and therefore semantic cues are used in retrieval. Once cued, the memory is retrieved as episodic and follows a pattern similar to that of a spreading activation model. This is particularly evident in AJ's case. She describes how one memory triggers another, which in turn triggers another and how she is powerless to stop it: \\"It's like a split screen; I'll be talking to someone and seeing something else.\\" This theory serves to explain why hyperthymestics have both a sense of 'knowing' (semantic memory) and 'remembering' (episodic memory) during recollection. One writer claimed hyperthymesia may be a result of reviewing memories constantly to an obsessive-compulsive degree. However AJ has completely dismissed this article as \\"a load of crap\\" and others with hyperthymesia claim to never revisit uneventful memories. Other findings have shown that the tendencies to absorb new information and fantasize are personality traits that are higher in hyperthymestics than the rest of the population. These traits, absorption and fantasizing, also correlated with one of the tests that measures superior autobiographical memory within the hyperthymestic sample. Biological An MRI study conducted on AJ provides a plausible argument as to the neurological foundation of her superior memory.Elias, Marilyn. \\"MRIs reveal possible source of woman's super-memory\\". USA Today. January 28, 2009 Both the temporal lobe and the caudate nucleus were found to be enlarged. The hippocampus, located in the medial temporal lobe, is involved in the encoding of declarative memory (memory for facts and events), while the temporal cortex is involved in the storage of such memory. The caudate nucleus is primarily associated with procedural memory, in particular habit formation, and is, therefore, intrinsically linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Parker and colleagues speculated that a defective frontostriatal circuit could be responsible for the observed executive function deficits in hyperthymesia. This circuit plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental disorders. Given the parallels in some aspects of behavior, AJ's hyperthymestic abilities possibly stem from atypical neurodevelopment. Scientists now need to ascertain if and how these brain areas are connected to establish a coherent neurological model for superior autobiographical memory. Diagnosis Parker and colleagues used a variety of standardised neuropsychological tests in their diagnosis of AJ's hyperthymesia. These included tests of memory, lateralisation, executive functions, language, calculations, IQ, and visual-spatial and visual-motor functions. They also devised novel tests to examine the extent of her memory abilities. These mostly consisted of questions pertaining to specific dates and events in history. Some of her personal recollections were verified with diary entries, as well as by her mother. Neuroscientist David Eagleman at Stanford University developed a free on-line test for hyperthymesia (no longer available). Participants first give their year of birth, and then are challenged to match dates to 60 famous events that happened between the time they were five years old and the present day. To qualify as potentially hyperthymestic, participants must achieve a score at least three standard deviations above the average. To prevent people from searching for answers on- line during the test, reaction time for each question is measured; answers must be chosen within 11 seconds to qualify for consideration. However, many of the questions are sourced in American culture and test results could have a strong cultural bias against non-Americans. Society and culture Notable cases As of April 2016, six cases of hyperthymesia have been confirmed in peer-reviewed articles, the first being that of \\"AJ\\" (real name Jill Price) in 2006. More cases have been identified that are yet to be published. AJ's case was originally reported by researchers from the University of California, Irvine, Elizabeth Parker, Larry Cahill, and James McGaugh, and is credited as being the first case of hyperthymesia. AJ can apparently recall every day of her life from when she was 14 years old: \\"Starting on February 5th, 1980, I remember everything. That was a Tuesday.\\" In March 2009, AJ was interviewed for an article in Wired magazine by Gary Marcus, a cognitive psychologist at New York University. Price's brain had been subject to a brain scan and the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex had been reportedly normal. Marcus claimed, however, that her brain resembled \\"those of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder\\" and suggested that her remarkable memory might be \\"the byproduct of obsession\\", claiming also that \\"the memory woman clings tightly to her past\\". Price has since reacted angrily to such claims and McGaugh has also expressed skepticism about this explanation. Price gave her first interview in over a year for the UK's Channel 4 documentary The Boy Who Can't Forget, and provided an insight into just how difficult life can be for people who have this ability. As the condition has become better known, more people claiming to have hyperthymestic abilities have emerged. In the aftermath of the 2006 Neurocase publication alone, more than 200 people contacted McGaugh; however, only a handful of cases were determined to be actual cases of hyperthymesia. The second verified case was Brad Williams, the third was Rick Baron,Elias, Marilyn. \\"Another person with super-memory skills comes forward\\". USA Today. May 13, 2008 and in 2009, Bob Petrella became the fourth person diagnosed with hyperthymestic syndrome. On December 19, 2010, actress Marilu Henner was featured on the US television program 60 Minutes for her superior autobiographical memory ability. Henner claimed she could remember almost every day of her life since she was 11 years old.Dionne, Zach. \\"'Taxi' Actress Marilu Henner Has Super-Rare Autobiographical Memory Ability\\". Popeater. December 20, 2010 The show was initially pitched as a story featuring hyperthymestic violinist Louise Owen, but the reporter Lesley Stahl volunteered her friend Henner as having a similar ability. In June 2012, the case of HK Derryberry was reported, a blind 20-year-old man who could clearly recall every day of his life since the age of about 11. Derryberry had been born at 27 weeks, weighing just over and was in neonatal intensive care for 96 days. A severe brain hemorrhage was the likely cause of cerebral palsy, and his prematurity resulted in congenital blindness. He told researchers that his memories are rich in sensory and emotional details, regardless of whether they are from years ago or yesterday. About 90% of his memories are in the first person, compared with an average of 66% in the general population. Brandon Ally and his team, at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, conducted a series of tests with the subject, including a brain scan that was compared with 30 age-matched controls. His brain was smaller than average (probably a result of his premature birth at 27 weeks). His right amygdala, however, was 20% larger, with enhanced functional connectivity between the right amygdala and hippocampus and in other regions. In 2016, HK's remarkable life story was published by HarperCollins Christian Publishing in a book entitled \\"The Awakening of HK Derryberry: My Unlikely Friendship with the Boy Who Remembers Everything\\". It was written by his mentor Jim Bradford with the help of Andy Hardin.In 2016, HK's life story was published by HarperCollins Christian Publishing in \\"The Awakening of HK Derryberry: My Unlikely Friendship with the Boy Who Remembers Everything,\\" which detailed his medical condition. In September 2012, UK's Channel 4 screened the documentary The Boy Who Can't Forget, which examined the memory of 20-year-old Aurelien Hayman from Cardiff, a student at Durham University, who remembers practically every day of his life from the age of 10. Hayman is the first British person to be identified as possessing this ability, and he views it positively. When Hayman's brain was scanned by a team led by Professor Giuliana Mazzoni at the University of Hull, whilst he was prompted to remember a series of dates, a series of \\"visual areas\\" of the brain were activated, with much greater speed than would be expected in normal brain function. Potential problems with total recall were illustrated. The documentary also featured 62-year-old TV producer Bob Petrella, whose memory has allowed him to catalogue the events from his \\"favorite days\\" over many years into an extensive scrapbook. In March 2015, Markie Pasternak of Green Bay, Wisconsin was diagnosed as the youngest person to be living with HSAM. Born in 1994, Pasternak remembers every day of her life since February 2005. She was featured on 60 Minutes Australia in August 2016 with Rebecca Sharrock. In January 2016, painter and polymath Nima Veiseh was featured by the BBC for his use of hyperthymesia to create paintings that could only be produced with his ability. Veiseh claimed he could remember almost every day of his life since he was 15 years old, and that his ability to synthesize time and an \\"encyclopedic knowledge of the history of art\\" enabled him to create wholly unique visions on canvas. In March 2016 NPR examined further Veiseh's exploration of time and the human experience through art. In April 2017, Rebecca Sharrock of Brisbane, Australia became known as a person who claims to recall even circumstantial details of every day of her life from her 12th day of life onward. Discussing her hyperthymesia with BBC World Service, Sharrock revealed she was supporting two research projects ‚Äì one with the University of Queensland and another with the University of California ‚Äì to understand how a greater knowledge of hyperthymesia can support Alzheimer's disease research, particularly in repairing the degeneration of the Hippocampus. Scans conducted during the studies showed that Sharrock's brain exhibited a heightened connection between the conscious and sub-conscious parts of her brain, which may aid easier memory recall ‚Äì particular for events that took place earlier in life. In October 2018, it was reported that teenager Tyler Hickenbottom, who is an identical twin, had the condition, which allowed him to \\"remember every day of his life like it was yesterday\\". Controversies The debate as to whether hyperthymestic syndrome can be considered a distinct form of memory is ongoing. It is also open to question how far it is an all-or-none condition, or whether people can have the condition to different degrees. K. Anders Ericsson of Florida State University does not believe that sufficient evidence exists to suggest that the skills of AJ and Williams need additional explanation: \\"Our work has pretty much concluded that differences in memory don't seem to be the result of innate differences, but more the kinds of skills that are developed.\\" McGaugh rejects the idea that hyperthymestic syndrome can be explained away so easily; he argues that nothing explains how subjects are able to memorize so much: \\"You'd have to assume that every day they rehearse it... The probability of these explanations dwindles as you look at the evidence.\\" Cases of hyperthymesia have forced many people to re-evaluate what is meant by \\"healthy\\" memory: \\"it isn't just about retaining the significant stuff. Far more important is being able to forget the rest.\\" Significant debate also exists over the limits of memory capacity. Some are of the view that the brain contains so many potential synaptic connections that, in theory at least, no practical limit exists to the number of long-term memories that the brain can store. In 1961, Wilder Penfield reported that specific stimulation of the temporal lobes resulted in vivid recollection of memories. He concluded that our brains were making \\"continuous, effortless, video-like recordings\\" of our experiences, but that these records are not consciously accessible to us. However, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested that those with hyperthymesia may reconstruct memories from traces and incorporate post event information and associations‚Äîa finding at odds with Penfield's video-like recording analogy. Fiction Books * In the 1942 short story \\"Funes the Memorious\\" by Jorge Luis Borges, the protagonist suffers a head injury after which he gains the ability to remember every detail of what he experiences, but comes to view this as a curse. The condition may not technically be an example of hyperthymesia, but shares some features. * In the 1980 series \\"The Book of the New Sun\\" by Gene Wolfe, the protagonist remembers everything he has ever seen starting from infancy. He describes his memories as being so vivid that he is capable of re-living anything he has experienced whenever he chooses to do so. * In a 2011 manga by Kohske called Gangsta, the main character, Worick Arcangelo, is said to have hyperthymesia, which he uses to help police identify murder victims. * In the 2012 novel And She Was by Alison Gaylin, the protagonist, Brenna Spector, is a private detective with hyperthymesia. * In the 2014 novel The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North, the protagonist Harry August displays signs of hyperthymesia. Although it is never explicitly stated in the novel that he has the condition, Harry, who continuously lives his life over and over in an endless cycle, is able to remember every detail of all fifteen of his previous lives. * In the 2015 novel Memory Man by David Baldacci, the protagonist, Amos Decker, has hyperthymesia. In the book, a mystery-crime scene-thriller with graphic scenes, Decker uses his perfect memory brought on by a traumatic hit in football to solve the murder of his wife and child, and the school shooting connected to it. Decker recalls his memories as a \\"DVR\\", just playing when it wants to, or being rewound and played forward by conscious thought. Television * A 2011 episode of the TV series House entitled \\"You Must Remember This\\" is about a waitress with hyperthymesia. * The entire 2011 TV series Unforgettable is centered around a police detective with hyperthymesia. *A 2014 episode of The Blacklist features a character with hyperthymesia employed by a bank to avoid papertrails. * In the 2015‚Äì2016 Korean TV Thriller series Remember, the protagonist, Seo Jin-woo, has hyperthymesia. * On the American television series Superstore, the character Sandra Kaluiokalani has superior autobiographical memory. * In the 2017 episode of BBC TV series Doctors one of the characters has hyperthymesia. *The 2020 South Korean television series Find Me in Your Memory is about a man with hyperthymesia. Film * In the 2014 film The Dark Place, the protagonist of the story, Keegan Dark, has hyperthymesia. Keegan uses it to solve the mystery at the heart of the story. His hyperthymesia memories are visually depicted in the movie as \\"screens\\" appearing to Keegan, often in an overwhelming and distressing manner.

It contains a matrix language, a graphical notebook style interface, and a plot window. Euler is designed for higher level math such as calculus, optimization, and statistics. The software can handle real, complex and interval numbers, vectors and matrices, it can produce 2D/3D plots, and uses Maxima for symbolic operations. The software is compilable with Windows. The Unix and Linux versions do not contain a computer algebra subsystem. History Euler Math Toolbox originated in 1988 as a program for Atari ST. At that time, the title of the program was simply Euler, but it turned out to be too unspecific for the Internet. The main aim of the program was to create a tool for testing numerical algorithms, to visualize results, and to demonstrate mathematical content in the classroom. Euler Math Toolbox uses a matrix language similar to MATLAB, a system that had been under development since the 1970s. Then and now the main developer of Euler is Ren√© Grothmann, a mathematician at the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt, Germany. In 2007, Euler was married with the Maxima computer algebra system. Symbolic expressions and other functions were added to communicate with Maxima, and to reach a good degree of integration into the numerical Euler core. Overview The Euler core is a numerical system written in C/C++. It handles real, complex, and interval values, and matrices of these types. Other available data types are sparse, compressed matrices, a long accumulator for an exact scalar product, and strings. Strings are used for expressions, file names etc. Based on this core, additional functions are implemented in the Euler matrix language, which is an interpreted programming language in the style of an advanced BASIC dialect. Euler contains libraries for statistics, exact numerical computations with interval inclusions, differential equations and stiff equations, astronomical functions, geometry, and more. The clean interface consists of a text window, and a graphics window. The text window contains fully editable notebooks, and the graphics window the graphics output. Graphics can be added to the notebook window too, or can be exported in various formats (PNG, SVG, WMF, Clipboard). Graphic types include line, bar or point plots in 2D and 3D, including anaglyph plots of 3D surfaces and other 3D plots. Euler has an API to use the open raytracer POV-Ray. Euler handles symbolic computations via Maxima, which is loaded as a separate process, communicating with Euler through pipes. The two programs can exchange variables and values. Indeed, Maxima is used in various Euler functions (e.g. Newton's method) to assist in the computation of derivatives, Taylor expansions and integrals. Moreover, Maxima can be called at definition time of an Euler function. LaTeX can be used from within Euler to display formulas. For export of formulas to HTML, either the generated LaTeX images or MathJax can be used. A special export option exports all graphics to SVG. Euler also includes the Tiny C Compiler, which allows subroutines in C to be compiled, and included via a Windows DLL. Euler has a lot of similarity to MATLAB and its free clones (GNU Octave), but it is not compatible.

He is a current England U21s coach and club ambassador of Derby County. He made more than 550 appearances in the Football League and Premier League, including more than 250 games for Birmingham City and more than 100 each for Notts County, the club where he began his professional career, and for Derby County. Although born in Nottingham, England, he is a full Jamaican international and played 13 times for the Jamaica national team. He retired as a player at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, and took up the post of youth team manager with Notts County. Playing career Notts County Johnson began his career at Notts County, making his league d√©but in the 1991‚Äì92 season at the age of 18, playing 5 games as County were relegated from the First Division, the season before the Premier League was founded. It would be 10 years before Johnson played in the highest league in England again. Johnson became a first team regular in the following season, playing 37 league games in the 1992‚Äì93 season and helping County avoid a second successive relegation. The 1993‚Äì94 season was more successful for County as they finished 7th, missing out on the playoffs by three points. In contrast, the 1994‚Äì95 season was disastrous. County finished bottom and were relegated to the Second Division (the third tier of English league football). At the end of the season, Johnson left County, joining Birmingham City, who had just been promoted back to the First Division, for ¬£230,000. Birmingham City Johnson played 33 league games in his first season with Birmingham, helping the club to a safe mid-table position. The 1996‚Äì97 season saw Birmingham finish 10th, 5 points off the playoffs. The following season saw Johnson score his first career league goal, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Sheffield United on 22 February 1998. Johnson finished the season with 3 goals in 38 league appearances as Birmingham finished 7th, missing out on the playoffs by goal difference. Johnson scored 5 goals in 45 league appearances in the 1998‚Äì99 season and was the club's Player of the Year as Birmingham finished 4th, qualifying for the play-offs. After playing to a 1‚Äì1 draw in the play-off semi final, Birmingham lost to Watford, the eventual play-off winners, on penalties. The 1999‚Äì2000 season saw Birmingham again qualify for the play-offs and again fail to reach the final, losing in the semi-finals, this time to Barnsley, 5‚Äì2 on aggregate. The 2000‚Äì01 season saw Birmingham come close to getting promotion and winning the League Cup. Johnson scored twice in 39 league games as Birmingham again finished 5th, losing 4‚Äì2 on penalties after a 2‚Äì2 draw in the play-off semi-final against Preston. Birmingham also reached the final of the League Cup, losing 5‚Äì4 to Liverpool on penalties after a 1‚Äì1 draw. The 2001‚Äì02 season saw Birmingham finally promoted to the Premier League. Johnson scored one goal in 32 appearances as Birmingham finished 5th, beating Millwall 2‚Äì1 (on aggregate) in the semi-final and beating Norwich on penalties in the final after a 1‚Äì1 draw. The 2002‚Äì03 season saw Birmingham finish safely mid-table in their first season back in the top division. However, Johnson found himself out of the first team picture, and only played six league games all season. Derby County Johnson joined Derby on a free transfer in August 2003 after eight seasons with Birmingham. Johnson quickly established himself in the heart of the Derby defence, playing 39 games and scoring once as Derby narrowly avoided relegation from the First Division. The 2004‚Äì05 season (the first as the Championship, the new name for the old First Division), was a great success for Derby, as they finished 4th and qualified for the play-offs, though injuries to key players I√±igo Idiakez and Grzegorz Rasiak meant they lost in the play-off semi-final to Preston. The 2005‚Äì06 season saw Johnson named as captain, a role he held until 2006 when he was named club captain. It was a disappointing for Derby as a pre-season change of manager and the sale of several key players meant that the club finished 20th, with Johnson playing 31 games and scoring once. The 2006‚Äì07 season began well for Derby. After being top of the table for most of the season, the team slipped away towards the end of the season, finishing third and qualifying for the play-offs. After beating Southampton 3‚Äì2 on aggregate in the semi-finals, Derby beat West Bromwich Albion 1‚Äì0 in the final. Despite missing the end of the season (including all three play-off games) through injury, Johnson made 29 league appearances, scoring once. The 2007‚Äì08 season saw Johnson, now 34 years old, relegated to fifth-choice centre back. Consequently, in September 2007, Johnson joined Sheffield Wednesday on an emergency one-month loan deal. He made his debut on 22 September and made an impact as Wednesday picked up their first points of the season (which was 9 games old) in a 1‚Äì0 win against Hull City at Hillsborough. His loan was extended for a third and final month in November 2007, with Johnson playing 13 league games for Wednesday before returning to Derby at the end of December 2007. On 26 December 2007, Johnson returned to the Derby team to face Liverpool, coming on as a first-half substitute. His return was greeted by Derby fans with cheers and chants of \\"There's only one Michael Johnson\\". Johnson made 2 further league appearances and came on as a substitute in the cup against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough, where he was greeted by a hero's welcome from the Wednesday fans. He then left to re-join the team where he started his career, Notts County, on loan for the remainder of the season. Return to Notts County On 29 February 2008 Johnson returned to Notts County on loan for the remainder of the 2007‚Äì08 season, playing 12 times and scoring once. The goal, against Rochdale on 22 March 2008, was his first league goal in a Notts County shirt, and came some sixteen years after he had made his d√©but for the club. At the end of the season, he agreed a one-year permanent deal with the club following the completion of his Derby contract on 1 July 2008. Johnson played 29 games and scored 2 goals in the 2008‚Äì09 season as Notts County finished 21st. He played the final league game of his career in a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Dagenham & Redbridge on 25 April 2009, announcing his retirement from professional football at the end of his contract in May 2009, and remained at the club taking over the role of Youth Team Manager from the 2009‚Äì10 season. Playing style Johnson was a fans' favourite at all his clubs, most notably Birmingham, where he picked up the nickname \\"Magic\\" (in reference to Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, the American basketball player), for his often immense performances. During his career he was known as a quick, clever centre back. Johnson was known for his incredible leap, which scored him a number of goals for Birmingham. Managerial career When Notts County sacked manager Ian McParland, Johnson took over briefly as caretaker manager alongside Dave Kevan. During their brief spell at County, they drew against Rotherham United and beat Crewe Alexandra 2‚Äì0. When Notts County brought in Hans Backe as manager, Johnson returned to his role as the Youth team Manager. A succession of managers came and went over a short period of time, however Johnson was dismissed when Paul Ince was sacked and replaced by Martin Allen. Johnson took up a coaching position with Cardiff City in July 2015, as assistant to under-21 team manager Kevin Nicholson. He was appointed as head coach of the Guyana national football team in June 2018, In March 2019 he said he had previously had 10 or 11 job interviews. aiming to help them qualify for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.Michael Johnson interview: From Derby County to Guyana skysports.comMichael Johnson: ‚ÄòI stopped counting after 42 rejected job applications‚Äô theguardian.com On 2 September 2019 and having resigned from his role with Guyana, Johnson was named as a coach for the England U21s as part of The FA's 2019/20 Elite Coach Placement Programme. Controversy A Christian, Johnson told a BBC interview in 2012 that he would not support a Football Association (FA) campaign against homophobia \\"because of my beliefs, because of the Bible that I read, in the Bible it does state that homosexuality is detestable unto the Lord.\\" In January 2014 the interview was referenced again when Johnson was appointed to the FA's Inclusion Advisory Board. He claimed that his opinion had shifted in the intervening period but nevertheless on 7 January 2014 he announced his intention to step down from the position.

The station was the southern terminus of the network operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM), the main railway operator in Malaysia, until 30 June 2011 when the station ceased operations with relocation of the KTM station to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. The land on which the station and the KTM railway tracks stood was originally owned by KTM and over which Malaysia had partial sovereignty. This arrangement lasted until 30 June 2011, when rail service to Tanjong Pagar was ended and the land reverted to Singapore. The main building of the railway station was gazetted as a national monument on 9 April 2011, completing one of the objectives of the new Points of Agreement between Malaysia and Singapore. It will be a future site for Cantonment MRT station, one of the stations for Circle MRT line Stage 6. History Topdown view of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station Before the Johor- Singapore Causeway across the Straits of Johor was built, the railway in Singapore was limited to the island. The construction of the causeway began in 1919, and it was opened to goods trains on 17 September 1923 and to passenger trains on 1 October 1923. Previously, passengers and goods, particularly to service the transportation of tin and rubber industry in Malaya were transferred at Woodlands to a ferry to Johor Bahru and the connecting train on the peninsula. Tanjong Pagar railway station was completed on 3 May 1932 and officially opened by Sir Cecil Clementi. It was around for 79 years before it ceased operations on 1 July 2011 to be reserved as the Singapore Railway Museum. Singapore Government Railway In 1859, Captain William Cloughton built the first dry dock. With the emergence of steamships and growth of shipping industry, Tanjong Pagar Dock Company was formed in 1864, building wharves in the area. The area grew and was known as the ‚ÄòNew Harbour‚Äô shortly before being renamed as Keppel Harbour in 1900 by Acting Governor, Sir Alexander Swettenham. Subsequently, with much political demands, plans to build a railway through Singapore, primarily to service the New Harbour, came underway in 1899 and the Singapore-Kranji Railway was completed in 1903. Between 1906 & 1907, the line was extended southwards from the terminus station at Tank Road to Tanjong Pagar and the wharves. It was eventually disused due to noise complaints by nearby residents.  Train services  KTM used to run six daily KTM Intercity trains between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia. It also ran several other trains between Singapore and other parts of Peninsular Malaysia, such as Kelantan state in the northeast. It also operated a shuttle service between Johor Bahru and Singapore for commuters. Until 30 June 2011, the stops in Singapore were at Woodlands (for immigration clearance by Singapore Immigration and disembarkation of passengers travelling from Malaysia) and Tanjong Pagar (embarkation and disembarkation). Since 1 July 2011, the only stop in Singapore is at Woodlands. Tanjong Pagar and Outram Park MRT stations are approximately 1 km from the Tanjong Pagar railway station.  Intangible heritage  Upon arriving in TPRS's main hall, the first thing that many encounter was Habib Railway Book Store and Money Changer. Having been part of the station scenery since 1936, it is certainly one institution that many regular passengers would patronize before embarking on their trip. Opened in 1936, the shop was where Mohd Seeni, a proprietor, used to work before taking over in 1958. He was the longest serving staff in the station. The station canteen, renowned for its tasty and affordable food, had been established since 1984 by the Hasan brothers. One of the hawkers, Mohammed Ali Latif, had been selling Nasi Bryani in the canteen for 8 years before its closure. He started his business from scratch, selling 20-30 servings a day to about 300 a day. On the last day of business in the station, his food was sold out within 2 hours with more than 700 loyal customers coming to support him. TPRS was also home to Mr Dennis Lim, whose father used to run the station hotel for over 60 years since 1932. The 34-rooms hotel was housed in the upper floors of the station and its service was known to be equivalent to Raffles Hotel during its peak, to the extent that many dignitaries like the Malaysian royalties frequent the hotel. Having lived and worked there most of his life, Lim also mentioned that the hotel exuded a strong colonial ambience, with massive rooms having high ceilings and restaurant's waiters dressed in white with silver buttons. The popularity of the hotel began declining in the 1970s due to physical deterioration of the station building and the negligence of maintenance by the Malayan Railway authorities. Roof leakage caused much ceiling moisture damage and plumbing problems became a prevalent issue. All these led the decline in the hotel's appeal and business spiraled downwards.  Cessation of operations  A notice of the cessation of operations at the Tanjong Pagar train station displayed on board a train from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore (Tanjong Pagar) on 26 June 2011, during the last week of the station's operations. Following an agreement between the governments of Malaysia and Singapore on 24 May 2010, railway operations at the station ceased from 1 July 2011. The conserved building may be integrated with future developments on the site or turned into a museum. KTM's southern terminus was relocated to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint. The closure of the line between Tanjong Pagar and the Woodlands checkpoint was something that had been considered for some 20 years with the intention made clear through the Malaysia‚ÄìSingapore Points of Agreement of 1990, though the exact details could not be agreed upon until the agreement was signed between the two countries in 2010. Though supported by some, the closure was opposed and lamented by others as representing a great loss of Singapore's heritage and of a key public transportation facility. Following closure, Singapore had 180 km of railway lines. Proposed redevelopment In 2015, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) proposed that the station be converted into multi-functional community space as part of the revamp of the Rail Corridor stretching from Kranji to Tanjong Pagar. A request for design plan was announced. The winning proposal for Tanjong Pagar Railway Station includes a public park in front of the station named Station Green, and an integrated entrance to an underground MRT station. Facilities such as an auditorium and art gallery would be added, and the Railway Corridor would become a linear park that would be nearly ten times longer than New York's High Line. The redevelopment is set to take place over 20 years.  Architecture  The building is in a richly ornamented Art Deco style. On its exterior are four reliefs of white marble, allegories of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce and Transport. They are works by , a sculptor from Florence, Italy. The hall has a barrel vault roof. Inside the main public hall, the walls bear panels with scenes depicting economic activities that were historically significant in Malaya: rice planting, rubber tapping, shipping activities, bullock cart transport, copra growing and tin mining. These panels and the original floor slabs were manufactured locally, using rubber to deaden noise. The two long platforms were capable of accommodating the longest mail trains, covered by umbrella reinforced concrete roofs. Disputes between Singapore and Malaysia The status of the railway station was disputed between the governments of Malaysia and Singapore. When Singapore left Malaysia in 1965, there was no border control between the two countries. When the two countries established border controls, both the Malaysian and Singaporean Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) officers were stationed at Tanjong Pagar for clearance of railway passengers. Road travellers clear immigration at the Malaysian side of the causeway and Woodlands, Singapore upon entry to Singapore. In this case, the CIQ of both countries are separated. Malaysia-Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990 In 1990, Malaysia and Singapore signed an agreement concerning Tanjong Pagar railway station. Malaysia agreed to relocate the station to Bukit Timah, thus freeing up land for development. In return, Singapore agreed that railway land at Tanjong Pagar would be handed over to a private limited company for joint development, with equity split 60% to Malaysia and 40% to Singapore. However, the parties interpreted the agreement in very different ways. Singapore insisted that the agreement took immediate effect but Malaysia argued that the agreement would come into effect only after it decided to move the station.

Photo taken on final month of operation. Immigration control issues Since 1992 KTM has worked with Singapore on re-aligning its railway tracks at Woodlands, where Singapore built a new immigration checkpoint to replace the old checkpoint, with facilities to carry out train passengers' immigration clearance instead of at Tanjong Pagar. In 1993, Malaysia responded that it would transfer its CIQ operations to the new Woodlands checkpoint. However, in June 1997 Malaysia stated that the Malaysia-Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990 would come into effect only after it decided to relocate Tanjong Pagar station. Malaysia also informed Singapore that it had changed its mind and decided not to co-locate its CIQ with Singapore's at Woodlands Train Checkpoint (WTCP) but to remain at Tanjong Pagar. In April 1998, Singapore informed Malaysia that it would be moving its CIQ operations to Woodlands while Malaysia would have to move its CIQ out of Singapore from 1 August 1998. Malaysia requested, instead, that space be made available at the WTCP, as an interim arrangement, for Malaysian Immigration officials to operate from there and thereby overcome the problem of sequence of exit and entry stampings by Singapore and Malaysia immigration authorities. According to a press release from the Ministry of Home Affairs of Singapore dated 24 July 1998: * Singapore will allow Malaysian customs officials to operate at Tanjong Pagar railway station. Singapore officials will be present at Tanjong Pagar railway station to lend their authority to Malaysian customs officials during the interim period. * Singapore has agreed to Malaysia's request to allow Malaysian Immigration to put some desks for its immigration officers on the passenger platform at WTCP to clear passengers after Singapore has cleared them for exit from Singapore. Singapore Immigration must clear departing passengers for exit from Singapore before Malaysian Immigration clears them for entry into Malaysia. Otherwise, the sequence of immigration clearance will be illogical and it will cause problems in crime investigation and prosecution. These interim arrangements will overcome the problems which would be caused if Malaysian Immigration were to remain in Tanjong Pagar railway station. However, Malaysia refused to have its immigration clearance on the platform: it insisted that Malaysian Immigration should be inside the building at WTCP. If this was not possible, it said that Malaysian Immigration would remain at Tanjong Pagar. Singapore argued that Malaysia's decision to locate its Immigration Control Post in Singapore was not in compliance with Malaysia's own law. Under Malaysian law, it is Johor Bahru railway station, not Tanjong Pagar, that is gazetted as an Immigration Control Post for persons travelling by train from Singapore to Malaysia. Singapore also pointed out that this was confirmed by the endorsement on the passports of passengers boarding the train at Tanjong Pagar, which showed: > \\"MALAYSIA IMMIGRATION > JOHOR BAHRU > SOCIAL/BUSINESS VISIT PASS > Reg. 11. Imm. Regs 63 > [Date]\\" > Permitted to enter and remain in West Malaysia and Sabah for one month from > the date shown above\\" On 1 August 1998, Singaporean Immigration ceased operations in Tanjong Pagar and moved to WTCP, while Malaysian Immigration continued operating in Tanjong Pagar. Malaysia decided not to endorse the passports of outgoing rail passengers from Singapore and promised to provide legal arguments to show that Malaysia's CIQ had the legal right to stay at Tanjong Pagar. The immigration clearance procedure which resulted from the impasse until 1 July 2011 was: * Towards Singapore, Malaysian immigration officers carried out immigration clearance on board the train at Johor Bahru railway station. After clearing immigration, the train crossed the causeway and stopped at WTCP, where all passengers proceeded to Singapore Customs and Immigration. Therefore, travellers entering Singapore by rail followed the correct order of immigration clearance, that is, exit granted by Malaysian Immigration in Johor and entry granted by Singapore Immigration in Woodlands. After clearing immigration at Woodlands, passengers could choose to leave the checkpoint or continue on the train to Tanjong Pagar. * Towards Malaysia, passengers boarded the train at Tanjong Pagar and cleared Malaysian Customs and Immigration before boarding. The train travelled for about 30 minutes to WTCP and stopped there for 30 minutes for passengers to clear Singapore Immigration. In this case, passengers were granted entry into Malaysia before clearing Singapore Immigration, which is contrary to international practice. To circumvent this problem, Malaysian immigration officers did not stamp passports. In early 2007, news of a Singaporean woman being jailed for failing to have her passport stamped when entering Malaysia threw the spotlight on the unusual clearance procedures. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded Singaporeans that their passports would not be stamped when departing for Malaysia by train, instead stamping a disembarkation card, which had to be retained until departure from Malaysia. The entry records were also entered into a computer system. Even then, this arrangement continued to present problems for some commuters. Relocation agreed On 24 May 2010, a meeting between Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong in Singapore resolved the relocation issue. In a joint statement after the meeting, they announced that KTM would move out of Tanjong Pagar railway station and establish a station at the Woodlands Train Checkpoint (WTCP), making it the southern terminus of the Malaysian rail network, from 1 July 2011. Malaysia would also relocate its customs, immigration and quarantine facilities from Tanjong Pagar to the WTCP, enabling an integrated border crossing facility between Malaysia and Singapore. Singapore agreed to ensure a connecting bus service between WTCP and a nearby MRT station, and for the National Heritage Board to preserve the station building in any development of the area. Bukit Timah railway station building at Blackmore Drive can also be conserved. Both sides agreed to create a consortium called M-S Pte Ltd, of which 60% equity is owned by Malaysia's Khazanah Nasional Berhad and 40% by Singapore's Temasek Holdings Ltd. The company will be vested with three parcels of land in Tanjong Pagar, Kranji and Woodlands and three additional pieces of land in Bukit Timah (Lot 76-2 Mk 16, Lot 249 Mk 4 and Lot 32-10 Mk 16) in exchange for the return of KTM railway land to Singapore, which was swapped with the Marina One and dUO plots of land, which is located at Marina Bay and Bugis areas in Singapore, in a bid to boost the financial growth in the central business district, and the nearest MRT stations to their M-S Pte Ltd ownage of the land are Marina Bay and Bugis. Both sides also agreed to the building of a rapid transit link between Johor Bahru and Singapore to enhance connectivity across the Causeway. After the completion of the link, the KTM terminus may be relocated to Johor. The last train out of Tanjong Pagar was driven by Sultan Ibrahim Ismail of Johor, whose grandfather, Ismail of Johor, had opened the causeway between Singapore and Malaya in 1923. The Sultan had to learn how to drive a train before he was able to perform this task, receiving training from KTM. Two drivers accompanied him to ensure safety.

On March 22, 2006, with 101 people aboard, she failed to make a planned course change, ran aground and sank. Two passengers, whose bodies were never found, died in the incident. The ship had a gross register tonnage of 8,806 (the fifth largest in fleet), and an overall length of (14th longest in the fleet). She had a capacity of 700 passengers and 115 cars. History Construction and service with Stena Line The ship was built by AG Weser, Bremerhaven, Germany in 1969, and was originally operated by Stena Line as Stena Danica on the route between Gothenburg (Sweden) and Frederikshavn (Denmark). She was sold to BC Ferries for CAD $13.875 million. With federal import duties the initial cost of the ship to B.C. ferries was $17.7 million. With BC Ferries After purchasing Stena Danica from the Stena Line, the ship was rechristened Queen of Surrey by then NDP Minister of Transportation and Communications, Robert Strachan,Bannerman, Gary and Patricia. The Ships of British Columbia - An Illustrated History of the British Columbia Ferry Corporation. Surrey: Hancock House Publishers, 1985 in April 1974. Queen of Surrey began operating between Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. This busy route requires 8 transits per day and due to her RORO bow design, it was quickly evident that the vessel was unsuitable for this route since she could not be loaded and unloaded as fast as necessary. The ship was decommissioned in 1976 and laid up at BC Ferries' dockyard at Deas Island in Vancouver while the government debated what to do with her. In May 1980, after an extensive $10 million refit for longer haul, northern service (staterooms, more restaurants and cargo holds) she was renamed Queen of the North. She was assigned to the Inside Passage route between Port Hardy on Vancouver Island and Prince Rupert in north-western BC. She occasionally also served Bella Bella, Skidegate (Queen Charlotte Islands), and several other small, north-western coastal villages. Due to the isolation of some of these communities (where roads were poor or non-existent), she served as the main source of transport, picking up residents and medical patients, and dropping off food, mail and supplies. In 1985, she was refurbished and designated the \\"flagship\\" of BC Ferries' fleet. After the sinking of in 1994, BC Ferries installed a second set of internally welded doors to prevent the bow from flooding in rough seas. During 2001, she was given a major $500,000 refit at Vancouver Shipyards, which included a redesign and modernization of the passenger decks. However, owing to her older single-hull design, the ship was not designed to survive a significant hull breach or the flooding of more than one bulkhead compartment. All newer ferries can survive flooding of at least two bulkhead compartments and because of this concern, the ship was intended to be replaced between 2009 and 2011. Sinking Queen of the North sank after running aground on Gil Island in Wright Sound, south of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. She sank at 12:25 am or 12:43 am PST (08:43 UTC) on March 22, 2006; there are conflicting reports about the exact time. News reports indicated that the vessel failed to make a planned course change and was at the time of the collision one kilometre away from where it should have been. She was bound for Port Hardy. According to emergency responders, the ship took approximately an hour to sink, giving passengers time to evacuate into lifeboats. Eyewitness reports confirmed the approximate time between the accident and the sinking and also suggest that the ship sank stern first. The ship's final position is according to the BC Ferries investigation. The Canadian Hydrographic Service's electronic navigational charts show the wreck at , WNW of the position cited in BC Ferries' investigation. The ship's captain, Colin Henthorne, was off watch and asleep in his bunk at the time of the accident.

On March 26, 2007, BC Ferries released its internal investigationBC Ferries internal report (PDF) March 26, 2007. into the sinking. The report concluded that Queen of the North failed to make the required or any course changes at Sainty Point, and that the ship proceeded straight on an incorrect course for over 14 minutes until its grounding at on Gil Island. The investigation found no evidence of alterations of speed at any time during the transit of Wright Sound and concluded that human factors were the primary cause of the sinking.News Release . Evacuation and rescue Final moments of Queen of the North A large number of small fishing and recreational vessels from Hartley Bay were the first on the scene to answer the distress call, arriving in a fleet of small watercraft in the dead of night to pick up survivors. Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria tasked Canadian Coast Guard vessels , , , and , along with two CH-149 Cormorant helicopters and one CC-115 Buffalo aircraft from the 442 Transport and Rescue Squadron at CFB Comox to the scene of the sinking. Originally the evacuation of the ship was reported to be a smooth one; however, stories of chest high water and trapped crew members surfaced on March 24. According to the official BC Ferries press release, 99 of the 101 passengers and crew were safely evacuated with only a few minor injuries, and many of them found refuge in nearby Hartley Bay. Loss of life Two people, Shirley Rosette and Gerald Foisy of 100 Mile House, British Columbia, apparently failed to reach the lifeboats and died when the ship sank.CTV.ca First glimpse of sunken ferry could come soon . While a passenger reportedly told police the missing couple were seen in Hartley Bay during the rescue effort, a thorough search of the small Aboriginal community of 200 people by police turned up nothing. In addition, the couple did not contact relatives after the sinking. When the ferry was located by submersible, the two missing passengers were not found in the wreck. BC Ferries crisis response The response by BC Ferries CEO David Hahn was that, although this was a catastrophic event, the emergency response by the crew is evidence of the safety of ferry travel. Hahn also stated a top-speed collision with Gil Island would \\"rip apart the hull of any ship, even a massive cruise ship\\".Mini-Sub to hunt wreck for missing couple . The Premier of British Columbia, Gordon Campbell, echoed this and met with survivors in Prince Rupert on the day of the incident. Despite these events, the Premier expressed confidence in the ferry system, saying that \\"The fleet is safe. Not only is the fleet safe, but it is manned by professional crews that are trained in safety.\\" This was the second accident of a BC Ferries vessel within a year. On June 30, 2005, lost power while docking. Coastal villages served by Queen of the North expressed concern about replacement transportation, as many of the small communities rely on BC Ferries not only for transport, but for food, mail and supplies. BC Ferries employed as the temporary vessel on the Inside Passage route until the replacement vessel, began service at the end of March 2007. The ferry corporation declined suggestions that the replacement ship be named in honour of the village of Hartley Bay.

On March 26, 2007, BC Ferries released the results of its investigation and blamed the accident on human error caused by three crew members, specifically Queen of the Norths helmswoman who was at the wheel of the ship as well as the ship's second and fourth officers who were in charge of navigation.Queen of the North bridge crew face disciplinary probe . A Vancouver Sun editorial on the accident notes that two ferry crew members on the watch‚Äîthe ferry's second and fourth officer‚Äîhave been uncooperative during the course of the BC Ferries internal inquiry.\\"Ferry worker's refusal to cooperate puts still more passengers at risk,\\" editorial of The Vancouver Sun, March 27, 2007, p. A12. BC Ferries President David Hahn doubts that any new information would be forthcoming from a future disciplinary inquiry due to the uncooperative response by these two officers on night watch at the time of the accident.Cindy E. Harnett, \\"Probe fingers crew in ferry sinking, the Vancouver Sun, March 27, 2007, p. A4. The Vancouver Sun states that the BC Ferries report \\"dismisses the idea that confusion over how to use new bridge equipment installed a month before the crash had anything to do with the sinking.\\" The BC Ferries report also highlights the role of the fourth officer who had control of the ship from Sainty Point, but failed to make the necessary course correction. According to the report, the Vancouver Sun writes that: : Just before the crash, the fourth officer screamed at the helmswoman to make a bold course correction--a 109-degree turn--and to switch off the autopilot. But she [the helmswoman] \\"stated not knowing where the switch was located.\\" [The] BC Ferries' report questions the validity of this evidence \\"as the autopilot disengages simply with a single switch and would have been operated numerous times by the [helmswoman].\\" However, in its own report, BC Ferries states the master found it necessary to post a note for navigational crew on how to operate the autopilot and included procedures for changing modes. Evidence was given that the woman at the wheel didn't know the location of the ship when she took over as lookout--or that the ferry was about to crash until she saw trees. She said she was asked to make only one, maybe two small course changes as directed by the fourth officer after she started her shift but that was...until just before the vessel hit Gil Island. The Vancouver Sun does cite an earlier safety board advisory which said that the bridge crew \\"were confused about how to use a new steering mode selector switch--that among other things controls whether the ship is on autopilot or manual steering--installed in a retrofit in February [2006].\\" However, BC Ferries concludes the bridge crew working the night of the disaster \\"chose\\" to use newly installed steering controls in a way \\"different\\" from the manner instructed but that this choice did not appear to have been the cause for the grounding of Queen of the North. David Hahn states that: : \\"The ship never altered course at all. It never changed its speed, it just ran straight into Gil Island...There's nothing to indicate they [the three crew members] ever tried anything, It's just human error.\\" While the three key crew members are reportedly cooperating with a separate Transportation Safety Board (TSB) inquiry into the tragedy, Michael Smyth, a newspaper columnist at The Province, notes that the TSB does not have the authority to assign blame to any party involved in the accident, unlike the BC Ferries internal inquiry.\\"Key crew should tell truth about what happened\\" by Michael Smyth, The Province, March 27, 2007. p. A7. Consequently, no one can be held accountable for the sinking of Queen of the North. On March 27, 2006, Alexander and Maria Kotai filed a lawsuit against BC Ferries for negligence, claiming that the company failed to train the crew adequately, supervise the bridge crew, keep proper lookout, operate at a safe speed, and conduct the evacuation to prevent or minimize injuries. The Kotais were moving house at the time from Kitimat to Nanaimo, and lost many of their personal possessions in the sinking. The amount of damages that they are seeking has not been specified.CKNW News Talk 980 - CKNWAM . On April 24, 2007, BC Ferries fired three Queen of the North crew members who were on the bridge when the ship collided with Gil Island and sank. BC Ferries claims that these three employees were not cooperating fully with all investigators. . The B.C. Ferry and Marine Workers' Union represents the ferry crew members.

The TSB's final report was released to the public on March 12, 2008. Its main conclusion was that sound navigational practices and regulations were not followed by the 4 unionized navigational crew at the time. On the morning of March 16, 2010, in B.C. Provincial Court in Vancouver, a charge of criminal negligence causing death was laid against Karl Lilgert. He was the navigating officer responsible for steering the vessel at the time of the accident. The charge was reported in statement issued by the province's Criminal Justice Branch. On May 13, 2013, Lilgert was convicted of two counts of criminal negligence causing death in B.C. Supreme Court by a jury after five days of deliberations. In 2015 the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear an appeal and it is expected he will have to serve his four-year sentence.

In the studio version of \\"The Electric Co.\\" found on Boy, \\"The Cry\\" is not incorporated in the song. \\"The Cry\\" preceded \\"The Electric Co.\\" at every concert since 1980 in Edinburgh until the end of The Unforgettable Fire Tour. During this period, Bono sang a snippet of \\"Send in the Clowns\\" by Stephen Sondheim at the end of the song. During The Joshua Tree Tour, it was played without \\"The Cry\\", and the number of times they played this song was reduced. It was last performed on August 3, 1987. On March 28, 2005, in San Diego, California, on the opening night of the Vertigo Tour, the song was performed for the first time in 17 years. It became a favorite on the Vertigo Tour. During the first leg of the tour it was preceded by \\"The Cry\\", but they stopped using it during the second leg, except in Montreal in the third set. Bono characterized \\"The Electric Co.\\" by the fragments sung during the song, such as \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" by The Smashing Pumpkins and \\"I Can See for Miles\\" by The Who, as well as the returning snippet of \\"Send in the Clowns\\" plus others. The song was played in most of the concerts in the first leg, and all but one of the shows in the second leg, and remained constant during the third before becoming used more sporadically. It had only appeared in one of the 21 concerts in 2006. It was not played again until the Innocence + Experience Tour where it saw occasional performances played after the show opener \\"The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)\\", again with \\"Send in the Clowns\\" and \\"I Can See for Miles\\" regularly snippeted. Live releases \\"The Electric Co.\\" has appeared in 3 video releases and 3 live album releases beginning with Under a Blood Red Sky, U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky, Live from Boston 1981, Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago and Live from Paris. In Under a Blood Red Sky, Bono sings a snippet of \\"Send in the Clowns\\" by Stephen Sondheim lasting 27 seconds. U2 didn't get permission to sing this song, causing them to pay US $50,000. The original release (along with other releases) contains the snippet, but others contained an edited version of the song. In U2 Live at Red Rocks, \\"Cry/The Electric Co.\\" was not in the original release of the film because Bono repeats singing the snippet of \\"Send in the Clowns\\" without permission. Bono also climbs a lighting rig while holding a white flag, during a part in the song, which became the cover of both the album and the film. The 2008 remastered edition contains an edited version of the song. Six days prior to the Red Rocks performance, 23-year-old Bono scaled a 50-foot lighting rig holding a white flag during \\"The Electric Co.\\" at the US Festival near San Bernardino, California on Memorial Day 1983, broadcast on MTV.

The temperate, oceanic climate has played a key part in the evolution of sport in Scotland, with all-weather sports like association football and golf dominating the national sporting consciousness. However, many other sports are played in the country, with popularity varying between sports and between regions. Scotland has its own sporting competitions and governing bodies, such as the Camanachd Association, the Scottish Rugby Union, Scottish Rugby League. The country has independent representation at many international sporting events, for example the Rugby League World Cup, as well as the Commonwealth Games (although not the Olympic Games). Scots, and Scottish emigrants, have made several key contributions to the history of sport, with important innovations and developments in: golf, curling, football, rugby union (the invention of rugby sevens, first international, and first league system), Highland games (which have contributed to the evolution of modern athletics events), shinty (the predecessor of both ice hockey and bandy), cycling (Kirkpatrick Macmillan invented the pedal bicycle), and water polo (first set of rules, games and internationals). Highland games, the largest and most widespread multi-sport festivals of the 19th century, are claimed to have influenced Baron Pierre de Coubertin and Dr William Milligan Sloane (a scholar of French History and close friend of Baron de Courbertin) of Princeton when he was planning the revival of the Olympic Games. De Coubertin and Milligan, who was researching his book on Napoleon at the time, saw a display of Highland games at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. Football codes Ever since the 19th century, the two main football codes in Scotland are association football (which is more commonly referred to as just \\"football\\" or \\"fitba\\") and rugby union, though the former being significantly dominant since World War II. Some others are also played. For Gaelic Football, please see under Gaelic Athletic Association, further down. Traditional football There is a long tradition of football games stretching back centuries. While these games were referred to as \\"football\\" (and numerous variants), many of them were very different from modern football, and involved carrying the ball. One of these games was outlawed in 1424. The history of football in Scotland includes various traditional ball games, for example the Ba game; some of these early games probably involved the kicking of a ball. Uncertainty about the specific nature of these games is because prior to 1863, the term \\"football\\" implied almost any ball game that was played on ones feet and not played on horseback. Some of these local games were probably played as far back as the Middle Ages, although the earliest contemporary accounts (as opposed to decrees simply banning \\"football\\") come in the eighteenth century. Many of these accounts refer to the violence of traditional Scottish football[Magoun, F.P. (1931) Scottish Popular Football, 1424‚Äì1815, The American Historical Review] and as a result many games were abolished or modified. Several burghs retain an annual Ba game, with the Kirkwall Ba Game in Orkney being probably the most famous form of traditional football in Scotland. Elsewhere in Scotland, the greatest evidence for a tradition of football games comes from southern Scotland, in particular the Scottish Borders. Association football The world's first official international association football match was held in 1872 and was the idea of C. W. Alcock of the Football Association which was seeking to promote Association Football in Scotland.Minutes of the Football Association of 3 October 1872, London The match took place at the West of Scotland Cricket Club's Hamilton Crescent ground in the Partick area of Glasgow. The match was between Scotland and England and resulted in a 0‚Äì0 draw. Following this, the newly developed football became the most popular sport in Scotland. The Scottish Cup is the world's oldest national trophy, first contested in 1873 (although the FA Cup is an older competition, its original trophy is no longer in existence). Queen's Park F.C., in Glasgow, is probably the oldest association football club in the world outside England. The Scottish Football Association (SFA), the second-oldest national football association in the world, is the main governing body for Scottish association football, and a founding member of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) which governs the Laws of the Game. As a result of this key role in the development of the sport Scotland is one of only four countries to have a permanent representative on the IFAB; the other four representatives being appointed for set periods by FIFA. The SFA also has responsibility for the Scotland national football team. The national stadium is Hampden Park in Glasgow. Supporters of the national team are nicknamed the Tartan Army, or the \\"Sporran Legion\\". As of September 2009, Scotland are ranked as the 30th best national football team in the FIFA World Rankings. They have improved steadily after Walter Smith took over as manager, beating 2006 World Cup finalists France in a European Championship qualifier. The national team last attended the World Cup in France in 1998, but finished last in their group stage after defeats to runners-up Brazil and Morocco. They won a single point after a one-all draw with Norway. Elite club association football in Scotland is split between the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish Football League. Scotland's association football clubs have had a relatively high degree of success internationally . In terms of European competitions, Rangers, Celtic and Aberdeen have all won European competitions. Rangers, were the first British team to reach a European Final, the 1961 European Cup Winners Cup. However, Celtic are the only team to have won the European Cup (now known as the UEFA Champions League), Europe's premier competition. Celtic won this cup in 1967 becoming the first British team to do so. Their victory is an important one in football history with the competition being won with a team comprising no players born more than thirty miles (48 km) from the home of the club, Celtic Park. The most successful teams over the years have been the Old Firm: Rangers and Celtic. With Rangers having won more major trophies than any other team in professional football. Glasgow is therefore home to three major football stadia. With Celtic Park (60,411 seats), Ibrox Stadium (50,817 seats) and Hampden Park (51,866 seats). Rugby union Ireland, 2007 Rugby union in Scotland is administered by the Scottish Rugby Union. Murrayfield Stadium, in Edinburgh, is the home of the Scotland national rugby union team. Scotland are placed 5th in the World Rugby Rankings. They annually take part in the Six Nations and participate in the Rugby World Cup, which takes place every four years. Scottish players are also eligible for selection for the British and Irish Lions, a composite team that tours the Southern hemisphere every 4 years. The roots of Scottish rugby go back a long way. Many ball games played in Scotland, and referred to as \\"football\\" were frequently as similar to rugby as they were to soccer. The Scottish Football Union (SFU) was founded in 1873 and was a founding member of the International Rugby Board in 1886 with Ireland and Wales. (England joined in 1890). In 1924 the SFU changed its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union. The world's oldest continual rugby fixture was first played in 1858 between Merchiston Castle School and the former pupils of The Edinburgh Academy. The Edinburgh Academy was also involved in the first ever international rugby union game when a side representing England met the Scottish national side on the cricket field of the Academy at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh on 27 March 1871, which Scotland won. The national side today competes in the annual Six Nations Championship and has appeared at every Rugby World Cup. Scotland has two professional sides that compete in the Pro14 and the European Professional Club Rugby tournaments ‚Äì Edinburgh Rugby and Glasgow Warriors. Two other professional sides also formerly existed: Caledonia Reds and the Border Reivers but these sides were disbanded due to funding problems in the SRU. The Scottish League Championship exists for amateur and semi-pro clubs. The national side regularly fill Murrayfield for Six Nations fixtures. Rugby union is most popular in the Borders region, where it is played widely, and this is probably the only area of Scotland where rugby is the most popular sport, although it has a strong presence in Aberdeen, Cupar, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling, Ayrshire and Perthshire. Rugby sevens Nestling beneath the shadow of the Eildon Hills, the Greenyards at Melrose in Scotland is the original home of rugby sevens Rugby sevens is a variant of rugby union, which was initially conceived by Ned Haig, a butcher from Melrose, Scottish Borders as a fundraising event for his local club, Melrose RFC, in 1883. The first ever sevens match was played at the Greenyards, where it was well received. The first ever officially sanctioned international tournament occurred at Murrayfield as part of the \\"Scottish Rugby Union's celebration of rugby\\" centenary celebrations in 1973. Due to the success of the format, the ongoing Hong Kong Sevens was launched three years later, and numerous other international competitions followed. In 1993, the Rugby World Cup Sevens, in which the Melrose Cup is contested, was launched, which is named after its town of origin. In the meantime, the Melrose Sevens continue to be popular and there is a healthy Borders Sevens Circuit. The annual IRB Sevens World Series, featuring international sides from around the world, used to feature the Edinburgh Sevens at Murrayfield, but that tournament has since been replaced by the Paris Sevens. Rugby league Rugby league is administered by Scotland Rugby League. The main international team has been playing since 1909 although their first proper international wasn't until 1996 when they beat Ireland in Dublin 6‚Äì26. In the 2000 Rugby League World Cup, Scotland finished last in their group, although only narrowly lost to Ireland, Samoa and New Zealand. The latter two matches were played in Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively. A major boost to rugby league in Scotland came when the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final was brought to Murrayfield, Edinburgh. On both occasions over 60,000 watched the final. This was coupled with a fantastic 42‚Äì20 win over France in July 2001, possibly one of Scotland's best wins in their short history. Scotland finished top of Group C in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup progressing ahead of Tonga and Italy but losing to New Zealand 40‚Äì4. In the 2016 Rugby League Four Nations Scotland came away with a historic draw 18‚Äì18 with New Zealand in Workington, Cumbria although finishing last in the tournament. The top tier of the domestic game in Scotland is the semi- professional Scottish National League currently features teams including the Aberdeen Warriors, Easterhouse Panthers, Edinburgh Eagles and the Strathmore Silverbacks. American Football It is played on an amateur basis throughout Scotland. There are 14 under 18 teams ranging from Inverness Blitz in the North, Inverclyde Hawks in the West through to Edinburgh in the East. 7 teams currently play in the BAFA Community Leagues with Glasgow Tigers, Clyde Valley Blackhawks, Dundee Hurricanes, Highland Wildcats, Edinburgh Wolves and West Coast Trojans playing in Division 2, and the East Kilbride Pirates playing in Division 1. A professional team the Scottish Claymores played in NFL Europe between 1995 and 2004 based in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Lawrence Tynes, Joe Andruzzi and Dante Hall all played for the team and went on to have success in the NFL. Australian Rules Football Australian Rules Football is a minor sport in Scotland. There are currently three teams in SARFL, most established in the early 2000s. It has seen growth around the major cities and now has a national team. Futsal, indoor football and five-a-side Futsal is a Brazilian form of football, similar to, but not the same as indoor football, which is more closely related to standard football. Five-a-side (not to be confused with fives) is popular in Scotland, with many casual leagues. Stick and bat games For hurling and camogie, please see under Gaelic Athletic Association. Cricket Ryan Watson batting against India Cricket has a much lower profile in Scotland than it has south of the border in England. Scotland is not one of the twelve leading cricketing nations which play Test matches, but the Scottish national team is now allowed to play full One Day Internationals, and takes part in the Cricket World Cup, in which Scotland reached the final tournament in 2007. Scotland has a well established recreational cricket structure. Scotland has co-hosted the 1999 Cricket World Cup along with England, Ireland and Netherlands. The governing body for Scottish cricket is Cricket Scotland, which administers women's cricket and junior cricket as well as the men's game. Cricket has an image as an \\"English\\" sport in Scotland, with many top players competing for the England national side, such as Jon Croft, and indeed, the national side competes in the English counties system. Freuchie Cricket Club in Fife famously won the Village Championship in the 1985. It is widely played in Scottish private schools, and has some presence in the major cities. Moreover, Scotland defeated England for the first time on 2018. They also participated in the 2015 icc world cup. Golf Scotland is the \\"Home of Golf\\", and is well known for its many links courses, including the Old Course at St Andrews, Carnoustie, Muirfield and Royal Troon. The first record of golf being played was at Leith Links in 1457. Scotland is at the forefront of international golf, with some of the world's premier courses being located there. The most famous courses, such as St Andrews tend to be on the east coast's dunelands, which are known in Lowland Scots as \\"links\\" ‚Äì this word has passed over into golf terminology as meaning a course. There are also major courses at Gleneagles, Ayrshire, East Lothian and Loch Lomond. While there is considerable disagreement as to where in Scotland golf was invented ‚Äì St Andrews, Leith or Bruntsfield ‚Äì or even if it was invented within Scotland ‚Äì both the Netherlands and China have staked claims ‚Äì the modern game was codified in Scotland. Much of golf terminology has its roots in Lowland Scots, e.g. caddy, links, tee etc. Shinty Women's shinty Shinty or camanachd is the traditional game of the Scottish Highlands, although historically it has a wider range. It is still played widely across the area today, with clubs also based in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Fife and Perth, and in most universities. Its governing body is the Camanachd Association (in Scottish Gaelic, Comunn na Camanachd) who are based in Inverness. The sport's premier prize is the Scottish Cup, more popularly known as the Camanachd Cup. Shinty also has the honour of having provided, according to the Guinness Book of Records, the world's most successful sporting team, Kingussie Camanachd. Shinty was formerly played through the Winter but has recently become a primarily Summer game. It has common roots with the Irish sport of Hurling. Baseball Baseball has existed in Edinburgh since the 1930s when it was played at US air bases at Kirknewton and East Fortune. In 2007 the Scottish National League was formed after previously being associated with British Baseball Federation. The league consisted of the Edinburgh Diamond Devils, Edinburgh Eagles, Strathclyde Falcons and the Glasgow Baseball Association. In 2011 the league was still going strong with the Edinburgh Diamond Devils, Edinburgh Cannons, Edinburgh Giants, and the Glasgow Baseball Association. There have been 8 Scottish baseball players to play in the Major leagues. Baseball is a minority sport in Scotland and is only played at an amateur level. Croquet The Scottish Croquet Association, formed in 1974, has responsibility for croquet in Scotland. Notable Scottish croquet players include Compton Mackenzie. Elephant polo Elephant polo is not played in Scotland, but gained notoriety within Scotland when The Duke of Argyll's team representing Scotland won the 2001, 2004 and 2005 Elephant Polo World Championships. Field hockey Field hockey is mainly played in the Lowlands, where it displaced shinty. Ice Hockey Scotland has a very long successful history of ice hockey, and it is the third most attended team sport in the country after association football and rugby union. Scotland are host to the oldest ice hockey team in Britain which are the Fife Flyers. At the moment there are four Scottish teams competing in the UK-wide Elite Ice Hockey League. Edinburgh Capitals have been in the Elite Ice Hockey League since it was formed and in 2010 they were joined by the Dundee Stars and the newly formed Braehead Clan and in 2011 the Fife Flyers were admitted as both their previous league and the Newcastle Vipers went bust creating an opening. Scotland has produced 3 of the top British Players of all time in Colin Shields, Tony Hand and Stephen Murphy. Lacrosse Lacrosse has a minor presence, tending to be played by girls at private schools, although there have been some male university teams as well. Field lacrosse is the main sport, but box lacrosse is also played. It is always at amateur level. However, lacrosse in Scotland goes back to 1890 at St Leonards School, Fife, where women's lacrosse had been introduced by Louisa Lumsden. Lumsden brought the game to Scotland after watching a men's lacrosse game between the Canghuwaya Indians and the Montreal Lacrosse Club. One of Lumsden's students, Rosabelle Sinclair, established the first women's lacrosse team in the United States was at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland. Scotland fields three national teams ‚Äì men's, women's and an indoor side Rock-It-Ball Rock-It-Ball has a minor presence, tending to be played in the Central Belt but is spreading throughout Scotland. The Scottish team won the World Cup in 2007 and 2011. Scotland is also leading the way in the individual version of the sport known as V2. The current World Champion is Scott MacMichael who plays his Rock-It-Ball with the Falkirk Cannons. He also is the only player to have won medals in the 2007 and 2011 team World Cup Victories. At Youth level Scotland has the top female player in World V2 in Meghan Plummer, who also plays her Rock-It-Ball with the Falkirk Cannons. It is a relatively new sport, having been created in the 21st century. Basket codes Basketball Basketball itself was originally invented by James Naismith, a Canadian of recent Scottish family origins, when he was in the USA. basketballscotland is the governing body of basketball in Scotland. Until the late 50s, Scotland was one of Europe's main teams as it twice qualified for the EuroBasket. Since then, the team declined. Scotland had some success at the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries where it has five bronze medals most recently in 2014. Netball Netball is played mostly by girls from the age of ten to fifteen, and is popular in private schools. Cue sports Cue sports are very popular in Scotland. Pool Pool tables are commonly to be found in Scottish pubs and social clubs. Snooker Stephen Hendry Scotland has produced many great snooker players over the years. Many of which have gone on to win the World Championship. Walter Donaldson was the first Scotsman to be crowned World Champion, winning in 1947 and again in 1950. In the modern snooker era the most successful Scottish snooker player is Stephen Hendry. He has won the World Snooker Championship a record 7 times, winning it 5 years in a row from 1992 onwards and holds the record as being the youngest ever winner, beating Englishman Jimmy White 18 frames to 12 in 1990 aged just 21 years. Between 1990 and 2012 Scottish players reached the final on 16 occasions, with Scots winning 12 Championships in that time. As well as Hendry's record 7 wins, John Higgins and Graeme Dott have also won the title. In 1996, the Scotland Team of Stephen Hendry, John Higgens and Alan McManus won the Snooker World Cup. Racquet sports Badminton BadmintonScotland is the national governing body for the sport of badminton in Scotland. There are two major tournaments ‚Äì the Scottish National Badminton Championships and the Scottish Open. Racquets Interior of the Eglinton Castle Racquets Hall in 1842 There are several former racquets courts in Scotland: Eglinton Castle, Fyvie Castle, Kinloch Castle (R√πm). However, the game is not much played any more. Squash Squash is played in most major urban centres. A notable player of squash, is Peter Nicol. After initially representing Scotland in international squash, Nicol switched his representation to England in 2001, claiming that he felt he was not receiving sufficient support from Scottish Squash, the national governing body.Peter Nicol defects to England 2001, BBC Tennis Scotland competes as Great Britain in tennis, however its contribution to the pool of British players traditionally has been very poor in the modern era with almost all notable players being English. However, this has taken an about turn in recent years with emergence of Andy Murray, and doubles players Colin Fleming and Jamie Murray. Andy Murray is by some distance the best player currently representing Britain as the UK number 1 and is also the world number 1. On 7 July 2013 he became the first British player to win the men's singles at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936, 77 years before. Brother Jamie and won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title along with Serbian Jelena Jankoviƒá in 2007, the first time any British player had won a major title at Wimbledon in 20 years. Colin Fleming along with his English partner Ross Hutchins is currently ranked 9th in the ATP Doubles Team Rankings. There are no official ATP tournaments in Scotland however, with all major events in Britain being contested in England. Royal Tennis The Real tennis court at Falkland Palace While this is an extremely minor game in Scotland there is an outstanding example of a Royal Tennis court at Falkland Palace. It is traditionally known as \\"caitch\\" or \\"cache\\" in Scotland, and is an ancestor of the better known form of tennis. Martial arts A wide range of martial arts are practised in Scotland, but are usually administered at UK level. Fencing Scotland has produced Olympic fencers, many Commonwealth medallists and some very successful Paralympian and Commonwealth wheelchair fencers. There are nearly 50 Olympic-rules fencing clubs active, with 37 of them currently affiliated to Scottish Fencing, the Home Country Governing Body. The most commonly used weapon in Scottish fencing is the foil. Many of these clubs are classically focussed. Scotland is at the forefront of the growth and development of the historic fencing movement with 16 historic fencing classes active, and many affiliated to the British Federation for Historical Swordplay. Many of these clubs are also classically focused. Judo Scots have been very prominent on the podium at the Judo events at the Commonwealth Games. Karate The main body for Karate in Scotland is the Scottish Karate Board Ltd Track and field events See also under Olympics and Commonwealth Games. Athletics Scottish Athletics is the governing body for athletics in Scotland. It replaced the Scottish Athletics Federation in April 2001. Marathon There are four marathons in Scotland: Edinburgh Marathon, Loch Ness Marathon, Lochaber Marathon and the Moray Marathon Angling Scotland has long been popular with anglers, both coarse and fly fishers. Many of its major rivers such as the Spey and Tay have famous fishing beats. The Malloch Trophy is Scotland's premier award for salmon fishing. The award is given for the largest salmon caught ‚Äì and safely returned to the water ‚Äì on the fly in Scotland each year. Bowls Lawn bowls is played in many parts of Scotland. Ten pin bowling arcades can be seen in a few places too. Much to the chagrin of bowling fans, bumpers are traditionally used in ten pin bowling. Boxing Notable Scottish boxers include world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan and Ken Buchanan; Lord David Douglas- Hamilton (who went on to become a Conservative politician) Canoeing A number of Scottish rivers are popular with canoeists, including the River Spey. Climbing and mountaineering Climbing is popular in some parts of Scotland. Notable climbers include Harold Raeburn. Cycling Cycling is a popular amateur sport, with 99 clubs throughout the country, from the Shetland Wheelers to the Stewartry Wheelers. At the elite level, Scots have been more successful at track cycling rather than road racing, although Scotland has a long history of time-trialing on the road. The lack of road races within the country, with not a single UCI-ranked event, is largely to do with the refusal of Scottish local authorities to close public roads to allow road races to take place safely. Scotland has three velodromes, one at Meadowbank Stadium, in Edinburgh, another at Caird Park in Dundee and a third, the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, which was built in Glasgow for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The governing body is the Scottish Cyclists' Union. In recent years mountain biking has become very popular, with Scottish geography being ideal for training and racing. A World Cup event is regularly held in Fort William. Scotland has produced several world-class cyclists. Robert Millar finished in 4th place at the 1984 Tour de France winning the King of the Mountains jersey; He also achieved 2nd-place finished at the 1985 and 1986 Vuelta a Espa√±a as well as runner up in the 1987 Giro d'Italia. In the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Chris Hoy became the most successful British Olympian in over 100 years when he cycled to 3 golds in the velodrome in sprint events (Sprint, team sprint and keirin). His achievements earned him the honour of carrying the nation's flag in the closing ceremony and a knighthood in 2008. Graeme Obree and David Millar (no relation) have also reached the very peak of their respective events. Curling Curling matches in progress. Along with golf, shinty and rugby sevens, curling is one of Scotland's sporting inventions Scotland is the home of curling which, although not as popular today as in Canada, remains more popular in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe. The Scottish men's team are the world's second most successful curling nation having won a total of 32 World Championship medals including 5 golds, with the most recent coming in 2009. The Scotland Women's Team have won the World Championships on two occasions in 2002 and 2013. Although elite-level curlers have been assisted significantly by funding from the National Lottery, facilities at the grassroots level have not benefited from this, with the number of ice rinks offering curling in Scotland declining from 31 in 1993 to 22 in 2018. Darts Darts is popular in Scotland, with many pubs having their own teams. Former world champions from Scotland include Jocky Wilson, Les Wallace and Gary Anderson. Gaelic Athletic Association Tir Conaill Harps Gaelic football team The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) has had a long history in Scotland, thanks to Scotland's substantial Irish population. The base of the GAA in Scotland is at Cambuslang, and GAA sports tend to be most popular in Greater Glasgow, although there is also a presence in various Scottish universities. Scotland GAA is the GAA board that is responsible for Gaelic Games in Scotland. Scotland is treated as a \\"County\\" by the GAA. Gaelic Football Gaelic football is also played in Scotland, and the games are shown in some of the country's \\"Irish pubs\\". University teams have had great success, especially those of Heriot-Watt and Napier. The \\"Gaelic\\" part of the name refers to Ireland, rather than Scotland. Hurling Hurling is a close relative of the indigenous Scottish sport of shinty, and there is an annual international between Scotland's shinty players and Ireland's hurlers, using composite rules. The traditional forms of hurling played in Antrim and Donegal, where many of Scotland's Irish immigrants originate from, were closest to Scottish shinty, and were at one point almost indistinguishable. The Ireland hurling plays an annual international against a Scottish shinty side under composite rules. Camogie is also played to a low level. Handball Horseracing As of 2020 Scotland has 5 BHA licensed racecourses. Hamilton Park races solely on the flat, Kelso and Perth provide jump racing under National Hunt Rules, while Ayr and Musselburgh are dual purpose courses providing both flat and jump racing. The flat racing course at Lanark was closed in October 1977. Point-to-point racing over jumps for amateur riders takes place at Overton in Lanarkshire and at Friars Haugh and Mosshouses in the Borders. The point-to-point course Balcormo Mains in Fife was used for an annual fixture in 2019 but after the 2020 fixture was closed due to Covid-19 lockdown it was announced that the course would close with immediate effect. The main meeting held is the Scottish Grand National, held over 4 miles and half a furlong at Ayr each April. One of the most valuable flat handicaps in Europe is the Ayr Gold Cup held over 6 furlongs at Ayr each September. Orienteering P√©tanque The French sport of P√©tanque is administered and promoted in Scotland by the Scottish Petanque Association There are 11 affiliated clubs in Scotland and many other groups which play on a casual basis. Rowing Glasgow East Boathouse Strathclyde Country Park is the home to the Scottish Rowing Centre, including an Olympic standard 2 km rowing course that has hosted rowing events at the Commonwealth Games and World Rowing Championships. Dame Katherine Grainger with five Olympic medals is Great Britain's most decorated female Olympian. Sailing There are various events including the West Highland Yachting Week. Offshore Power Boat Racing Scotland hosts the UK's premier offshore power boat race the P1 Scottish Grand Prix of the Sea Skiing Coire Fionn and Glas Maol Poma, Glenshee Ski Centre The Scottish Highlands are one of the few parts of the United Kingdom to have a number of ski resorts. Aviemore is a centre for the sport in the Cairngorms. There are also other resorts such as Aonach M√≤r, and slopes at Glencoe Ski area and Glenshee Ski Centre. The Midlothian Snowsports Centre near Edinburgh, known locally as \\"Hillend\\", is the largest dry ski slope in Europe. Speedway Scotland currently has two Motorcycle Speedway teams racing in the UK Premier League, Glasgow Tigers and Edinburgh Monarchs. Swimming The governing body is the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association. Most major urban centres and medium-sized towns have a swimming pool. Sea swimming does take place, but the low water temperature around Scotland tends to mean it is not particularly popular any more. Sub aqua Surfing Water polo Water polo is considered to be invented in Scotland with the original rules being written by William Wilson for the Bon Accord Club in Aberdeen in 1877. It was based on a game played in the rivers Dee and Don in Aberdeen. The first game in a pool took place in Glasgow and the Scottish rules were those most adopted during the early years of the sport. Additionally, Scotland provided a number of Olympians to the GB squads that were successful in the early Olympics. Scotland had a proud tradition of amateur water polo with many strong clubs across the country. However, it took a downturn after the early 1990s at which point it was successfully competing in home countries and 8 nations tournaments. As the rest of the world moved to deep water facilities, increased their training regime and professionalised their coaching structures, Scotland's water polo remained static and fell far behind. The national squad stopped competing in internationals in 2003 with the exception of the women's squad competing at the Commonwealth tournament in Perth in 2006. However, the sport has turned around since 2008 with fast growth of members, clubs and competitions. The national squads are once again competing internationally in the annual Celtic Nations tournament with recent wins in Women's 2010 & 2012 and Men's 2011. Scotland is expected to host the Commonwealth tournament in Aberdeen in April 2014. Blood sports All forms of animal fighting e.g. cock fighting, dog fighting, badger baiting etc. are banned, and have been for a long time. Fox hunting and hare coursing have been banned much more recently, and the former has never had a major presence in Scotland. Folk sports Aside from the Highland Games, a few localities have preserved traditional sports from before the standardisation of games. These include the ba games of Jedburgh and Kirkwall, and various forms of folk shinty, known as 'knottie' or 'hummie', which use improvised materials. Multisport events Highland games Caber toss, a distinctive Scottish athletic event The Highland Games are a distinctive feature of the national sporting culture. There are numerous annual games hosted in the Highlands including Braemar and Dunoon. They are also popular in various parts of the world, where large numbers of Scottish emigrants have settled. Events at the Highland Games often test physical strength, such as the weight over the bar and sheaf toss, and novelty events of recent origin such as haggis hurling. Commonwealth Games Island Games Scotland sends three teams to the Island Games tournament: one for the Orkney Islands, Shetland, and Outer Hebrides. The 2005 Island Games were hosted by Shetland. Olympic Games Scottish athletes have competed at every Olympic Games, since the inaugural modern Games, as part of the Great Britain and Ireland team (prior to Irish independence) and then the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team. A Scot, Launceston Elliot, won Great Britain and Ireland's very first Olympic gold medal, in 1896 in Athens. Some of the most notable Scots athletes are Eric Liddell, (whose story is featured in the film Chariots of Fire), Alan Wells, the Olympic 100m winner in 1980, and Chris Hoy, winner of six cycling gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Scotland have only ever won one Olympic medal as Scotland, when the men's field hockey team won a bronze medal at the 1908 Summer Games. This was also the only occasion when either England (gold) or Wales (bronze) have won a medal in their own right; and was Ireland's only medal (silver) prior to independence. The curling gold medal in Chamonix in 1924 was won by the Royal Caledonian Curling Club team, the Scottish national team, and the women's curling gold in Salt Lake City in 2002 was won by the top Scottish team at the time, skipped by Rhona Martin. There is a long- running Campaign for a Scottish Olympic Team In 2009, two sports of Scottish origin, golf and rugby sevens were accepted into the Olympics. Curling has been an event at the Winter Olympics for many years. For a list of Scottish Olympic medal winners, see Scottish Olympic medallists. Motorsport Scotland has a notable track record of success in the world of motor sport, being one of only five countries in the world to have produced World Champions on two, three and four wheels. Several Scottish competitors have had illustrious careers at the top level and success has come in many different championships including Formula One, The World Rally Championship, Le Mans 24 hours, IndyCar Series, the British Touring Car Championship, Grand Prix motorcycle racing, the British Superbike Championship and the Sidecar World Championship. Formula One Rubens Barrichello driving for the Stewart Grand Prix team in Montreal in 1997. The tartan livery of the team was a special Stewart F1 tartan designed for the team and its addition to the cars indicates the Stewarts' origins in Scotland. Colin McRae Dario Franchitti waiting to qualify on 12 May 2007 at Indianapolis. Scotland has had several Formula One drivers over the years since the championship commenced in 1950. A full list of these drivers can be found at :Category:Scottish Formula One drivers. Scotland's early successes in Formula One began with Innes Ireland, the Dumfries man winning Lotus‚Äô first Grand Prix, at Watkins Glen in 1961. However, perhaps the best known Scottish drivers are Jim Clark, who won 2 World Championships before his untimely death, Jackie Stewart who managed to gain 3 World Championships and David Coulthard who raced from 1994 to 2008 with McLaren F1, Williams F1 and Red Bull F1. Coulthard has been Scotland's most successful driver in recent memory finishing runner up in the World Drivers Championships in 2001. Other recent successes include Bathgate's Paul di Resta who drove for Force India between 2010 and 2013 and Oban's Susie Wolff who in 2014 became the first woman to take part in a Formula One race weekend in 22 years, at the British Grand Prix, at Silverstone. No round of F1 has however been held in Scotland making the country one of the most successful countries without hosting a race, however a 50 lap 100-mile (160 km) motor race run to Formula One regulations called the Scottish Grand Prix was held in 1951 and there has been public discussion about the possibility of reviving the event in some form. IndyCar IndyCar refers to the top-level American single-seater racing championship and it just so happens that Scotland is home to one of the most successful drivers in the history of US single-seater racing ‚Äì Dario Franchitti. Dario won the IndyCar Series championship four times and claimed the Indy 500 three times. On 6 October 2013, he was involved in a serious crash at the Grand Prix of Houston, when his car flew into catch-fencing after contact with another car. Franchitti suffered two fractured vertebrae, a broken ankle and a concussion in the accident. A month later, on 14 November 2013, Franchitti announced his immediate retirement from motor racing on medical advice. He retired with 31 victories from 265 starts in American open-wheel racing, a tally which put him in a tie for ninth place on the all-time wins list. The only other Scot to have had considerable success in US single seater racing, was the extremely versatile Jim Clark, who won the Indianapolis 500 in 1965. Rallying Away from the track, Scotland has always enjoyed a distinguished pedigree in stage rallying. The McRae name is perhaps one of Scotland's most famous exports, with Colin McRae winning the World Rally Championship in 1995. His ‚Äòflat-out‚Äô driving style earned him millions of fans around the world and he enjoyed cult status during his 15-year career at the top of the sport. Colin was the son of 5-time British Rally Champion, Jimmy McRae, and brother of Alister McRae who also enjoyed success in the world of international rallying. Scotland's most recent world crown was won in 2001, when Perthshire born co-driver Robert Reid won the World Rally Championship with Richard Burns. Louise Aitken-Walker also made significant inroads into the male-dominated sport and is Britain's most successful female rally driver of all time, claiming the ladies world rally championship in 1990. Endurance Racing One of the most enduring stories from the world of Scottish motorsport is that of the legendary Ecurie Ecosse racing team. From a humble back-street mews garage in Merchiston, Edinburgh the team stunned the motor racing world by beating household names such as Porsche and Ferrari. In 1956, David Murray's team won the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race with a privately entered D-type Jaguar, driven by Scotsmen Ron Flockhart and Ninian Sanderson. In more recent years, Scotland has continued to enjoy success in the world of endurance and sports car racing. Dumfrieshire's Allan McNish competed in F1 in 2002 for Toyota, but is best known for becoming one of the all-time greats in the gruelling world of sportscar racing, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans three times and finishing on the podium on no fewer than six further occasions. In 2013, he also won the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). Peter Dumbreck has also competed in the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, and is better known for his infamous accident in the 1999 event where his Mercedes-Benz CLR car suffered aerodynamic problems and took off, somersaulting through the air. In 2012, Bathgate's Marino Franchitti was confirmed as the first driver of Nissan's innovative DeltaWing as an unclassified entrant at Le Mans and in 2014 he won the 12 Hours of Sebring. Another star Scottish endurance driver is Ryan Dalziel who in 2012 won the FIA World Endurance Championship, as well as taking a class wins in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and in the 12 Hours of Sebring. BTCC In the British Touring Car Championship Scotland has had a double champion in John Cleland. A number of drivers have raced successfully in recent years including Anthony Reid, David Leslie and Gordon Shedden, who won the championship in 2012. One round of the championship is annually held at Knockhill in Scotland. Motorcycle Sport In motor cycling, the legends continue. Jock Taylor took the Sidecar World Championship in 1980 and Jimmy Guthrie and Bob McIntyre both set the standard for Scottish motorcycle competitors on either side of the war. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was Niall Mackenzie and Steve Hislop who led the way. Mackenzie competed in the 500cc Grand Prix championship (now MotoGP) for nine years from 1986 to 1994, only twice finishing outside the top ten. He went on to win the British Superbike Championship no less than three times. Borders man Steve Hislop won the British Superbike Championship in 1995 although was better known for his success in the Isle of Man TT races, winning no less than eleven TTs. In recent years Stuart Easton continues the charge for Scotland in the British Superbikes, while John McPhee promotes the Scots abroad, running in the highly competitive Spanish Moto3 class. The Scottish off-road motorcycling scene has produced numerous British Enduro and Motocross champions, most recently Richard Hay in the British Enduro Veteran Class. Euan McConnell contested the World Enduro Championship from 2001 to 2007. In 2009 and 2010 teams from Scotland competed to medal results in the International Six Days Enduro and in each of the same years Scottish riders successfully finished the gruelling Dakar Rally as the first Scots to do so. Scotland can even claim a World Champion in motorcycle stunt riding with Kevin Carmichael taking the title in 2002. Scottish Motorsport Venues There are various motor sport venues throughout Scotland, the biggest of which is Knockhill Racing Circuit in Fife . For Motorcycle sport in Scotland, the Governing Body is the SACU. Sports media Scotland has a distinct set of media products, especially when it comes to sports coverage. The main Scottish daily newspapers, the Daily Record, The Herald and The Scotsman, have extensive coverage of Scottish and international sport; and coverage of Scottish sport is one of the key tools used by Scottish editions of English newspapers, most successfully employed by The Scottish Sun. However, the vast majority of sports coverage in Scotland is of association football. There is also a variety of magazine titles. Titles include The Celtic View, Rangers News, bunkered, Scottish Club Golfer and Rally Action. The main sports television shows on the largest two channels are Scotsport on STV and ITV1 Border Scotland (which is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the world's longest running sports television programme) and Sportscene on BBC Scotland. BBC Radio Scotland's main sports show is Sportsound, and it has other sports output, for example the comedy show Off the Ball. All the main independent radio stations report on local sport, and often cover football matches live (although not the SPL, to which the BBC hold exclusive radio rights). BBC Alba's Sp√≤rs shows one full, delayed SPL match. In 2011, QuipuTV ‚Äì a multimedia production company and digital broadcaster specialising in livestreaming ‚Äì launched with the aim of providing a digital platform for minority sports in Scotland. They produce live programming for Cricket Scotland, Scottish Hockey Union, Scottish Swimming, and Netball Scotland.

It was established in 1987 as a free sister paper to the Manchester Evening News featuring a round up of the week's news. These days the paper also has a 12-page supplement called Metromagazine and a total circulation of 308,589 in the south Manchester area (VFD July to Dec 2004). It has a smaller geographical reach than the M.E.N.. It is delivered in south and east Manchester, Stockport, Trafford and the Wilmslow area - and has three separate geographical editions: City (in south and east Manchester), Trafford (in Trafford and Wythenshawe) and Stockport (in Stockport and Wilmslow). Most of the content of the paper is the same for all three editions, but a few pages differ, with more local advertising and editorial. In February 2010 along with the Guardian Media Group's other regional and local titles, the newspaper was sold to competitor Trinity Mirror plc.

Metro Metro International in Scandinavia started a trend for freesheet papers distributed daily to workers in populated area and this idea was brought the UK by Associated Newspapers who also decided to use the Metro name for their venture. However when Associated Newspapers wanted to launch their Metro in Manchester, Guardian Media Group (GMG) also decided to launch a freesheet daily paper in the city under the Metro name, with the argument that GMG's Manchester Metro News had been established in the region for many years. For a short time, Associated's Metro competed with GMG's daily Manchester Metro News (using the same name as the separate weekly newspaper above). Associated was forced to change its title's name to News North West. Eventually, Associated and GMG reached a deal whereby GMG's daily newspaper folded and Associated's paper was allowed to use the \\"Metro\\" title again.

History In the closing days of World War I, fighting broke out in Baku as a result of the Russian Civil War, with four groups fighting for control of the area when the Russian Empire collapsed. Fighting each other were the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Armenians and Azeris. Many people were killed in the fighting including some from a small British force sent to prevent Baku falling into the hands of the Russians. The Martyrs' Lane site first served as Muslim cemetery for victims of the March Events of 1918. The cemetery was completely destroyed and the corpses removed after the Bolsheviks came to power, who created an amusement park on the site and installed a statue of Sergei Kirov, the prominent Bolshevik leader. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the statue and the amusement park facilities were removed and the location was reinstated as a burial site for national heroes. The first buried at the newly instated memorial were those who had died during the Black January events of 1990 when Soviet forces invaded Baku. The memorial was next used for the burial of the bodies of men who died in the Nagorno-Karabakh War, an armed conflict that took place from February 1988 to May 1994, in the small enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in southwestern Azerbaijan, between the majority ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by Armenia, and the Republic of Azerbaijan. Design It is estimated that approximately 15,000 people are buried in the cemetery. It is located on a hill in the south of the city overlooking the Caspian Sea. It is considered a shrine to those who have given their lives for Azerbaijan's independence and attracts thousands of visitors each year. Memorials Memorial to the Turkish soldiers who were killed in combat. The Eternal Flame Memorial is located at Martyrs' lane and is frequently visited by Azerbaijani presidents and other dignitaries. Martyrs' Lane is also home to Baku Turkish Martyrs' Memorial, a large memorial to the 1,130 Turkish troops who were killed while fighting Bolshevik and Armenian forces during the Battle of Baku in 1918. Next to the memorial there is a martyrs mosque, also built by Turks. The memorial contains a hexagonal block clad in red granite; each face contains a pure white marble crescent-star, based on those in the Turkish national flag. It was unveiled by the former Turkish president S√ºleyman Demirel and the Azerbaijani president Heydar Aliyev at a formal ceremony in September, 1999. Not far from the Turkish memorial there is a small wall acknowledging the British soldiers killed during the same conflict.  Eternal Flame Memorial Complex  President Dmitry Medvedev at the Eternal Flame monument. The proposal to establish the Eternal Flame Memorial was put forward in 1994. The Parliament of Azerbaijan, on the initiative of President Aliyev, subsequently agreed to erect a national monument in memory of Azerbaijani martyrs. Aliyev personally oversaw the project. During the exhibition on the fifth anniversary of Black January, three proposals, including one by sculptor Omar Eldarov, were submitted to the President; he requested several more proposals. The proposal developed by the architect Elbay Gasimzade won the competition. On August 5, 1998, President Aliyev issued an order to erect an Eternal Flame monument in the Alley of Martyrs with funding of 2 billion AZN. The monument was inaugurated on October 9, 1998. The memorial complex is composed of a tomb standing on an 8-pointed star crown with a gold-framed glass dome. In 2007, the columns of the Eternal Flame were heightened and parts of the octangular star and eight-pointed mirror were made of gold. Notable burials The first tomb in the entrance of Martyrs' Lane belongs to married couple Fariza and Ilham Allahverdiyev who died during Black January. Ilham was shot dead by Soviet troops and Fariza committed suicide after hearing of her husband's death.–Ø–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–æ—Ä –ø—Ä–æ–∞—Ä–º—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ –Ω–µ–ø–æ–∫–æ–ª–µ–±–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç—å –≥–µ—Ä–æ–∏–∑–º–∞ –∞–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ –ê–ª–ª–∞—Ö–≤–µ—Ä–¥–∏–µ–≤ –ò–ª—å–≥–∞–º –ê–∂–¥–∞—Ä –æ–≥–ª—ã, 1962 –≥–æ–¥–∞ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è The tomb has become a symbol of fidelity and love.–í –ê–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω–µ –≤—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞—é—Ç –∂–µ—Ä—Ç–≤ —Ç—Ä–∞–≥–µ–¥–∏–∏ 20 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è 1990 –≥–æ–¥–∞ The cemetery also contains the graves of the journalists Chingiz Mustafayev and Salatyn Asgarova, who were killed during the Nagorno- Karabakh war.T…ôsis√ßil…ôr ≈ûurasƒ±  Gallery  File:Vladimir Putin in Azerbaijan 9-10 January 2001-10.jpg|President Vladimir Putin laying a wreath at the memorial.

It is named after the Be≈æigrad district in Ljubljana, Slovenia, where it is located. It is famous for its quality and for eminent alumni and is regarded as one of the top grammar schools in Central Europe. For a number of years it has been the school with the highest admission requirements in Slovenia and the school with the best national external examination results in the country. Be≈æigrad has produced a number of distinguished politicians, academics and businessmen. It has also produced more NBA league players than any other high school in the world outside of the United States.  History  Be≈æigrad Grammar School (Gimnazija Be≈æigrad) moved to the current building in 1936. The school was founded in 1596 as a Jesuit educational institution located in the town center of Ljubljana, then capital of the Duchy of Carniola. In 1773 the Jesuit order was abolished and the Gymnasium became a state institution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Until 1889 it was the only grammar school in Ljubljana. In that year, the Poljane Grammar School was founded and the old institution was renamed to \\"First Gymnasium of Ljubljana\\". Most of the curriculum was delivered in German language until 1907, when the Austrian government introduced Slovene as the main language of instruction in most grammar schools in Carniola. The First Gymnasium of Ljubljana began conducting parallel classes in German the following year. Later they were merged into a new grammar school, called the \\"Imperial Royal Gymnasium with German Language of Instruction in Ljubljana\\". The new school, known colloquially as \\"The German Gymnasium\\" or the \\"Third Gymnasium\\", was the predecessor to the current Be≈æigrad Gymnasium. According to the official statistic of the time, most pupils regarded themselves as ethnic Germans, although some Slovenes also attended the schools. After the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, the school was officially renamed to \\"Third Gymnasium in Ljubljana\\" and Slovene was introduced as the main language of instruction, although German classes were kept until 1924. In 1929, the school was renamed to \\"Classical Gymnasium\\". In 1936, it was moved to the current location in the Be≈æigrad district. When grammar schools were abolished under communism in 1982 the school was renamed to the \\"School for Sciences and Mathematics\\". Among the locals, it became known as the \\"Be≈æigrad Gymnasium\\". In 1990 the name was officially adopted and the school once again adopted a grammar school curriculum.  Profile  The Be≈æigrad Grammar School has historically been the most selective in Slovenia. Admission is decided based on primary school performance and standardized tests. The school does not have a catchment area. The school has consistently performed well in the Matura. An International School with English as the primary language of instruction is also a part of the Be≈æigrad Grammar School. It also runs a small and merit-based class of the International Baccalaureate with results being consistently among the top 5% worldwide. Competitive entry is offered at the end of the second year (year 11).  Notable alumni and professors  Several notable professors and pupils are associated with the Be≈æigrad Grammar School.

Science 284, 2118-2124, (1999). TNA has become an important synthetic genetic polymer (XNA) due to its ability to efficiently base pair with complementary sequences of DNA and RNA. However, unlike DNA and RNA, TNA is completely refractory to nuclease digestion, making it a promising nucleic acid analog for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.Culbertson, M. C. et al. Evaluating TNA stability under simulated physiological conditions. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 26, 2418-2421, (2016). TNA oligonucleotides were first constructed by automated solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite chemistry. Methods for chemically synthesized TNA monomers (phosphoramidites and nucleoside triphosphates) have been heavily optimized to support synthetic biology projects aimed at advancing TNA research.Sau, S. P., Fahmi, N. E., Liao, J.-Y., Bala, S. & Chaput, J. C. A scalable synthesis of Œ±-L-threose nucleic acid monomers. J. Org. Chem. 81, 2302-2307, (2016). More recently, polymerase engineering efforts have identified TNA polymerases that can copy genetic information back and forth between DNA and TNA.Larsen, A. C. et al. A general strategy for expanding polymerase function by droplet microfluidics. Nat. Commun. 7, 11235, (2016). Nikoomanzar, A., Vallejo, D. & Chaput, J. C. Elucidating the Determinants of Polymerase Specificity by Microfluidic-Based Deep Mutational Scanning. ACS Synth. Biol. 8, 1421-1429, (2019). TNA replication occurs through a process that mimics RNA replication. In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA. The availability of TNA polymerases have enabled the in vitro selection of biologically stable TNA aptamers to both small molecule and protein targets.Yu, H., Zhang, S. & Chaput, J. C. Darwinian evolution of an alternative genetic system provides support for TNA as an RNA progenitor. Nat. Chem. 4, 183-187, (2012). Mei, H. et al.

M. & Heemstra, J. M. In vitro selection of an XNA aptamer capable of small-molecule recognition. Nucleic Acids Res. 46, 8057-8068, (2018). Such experiments demonstrate that the properties of heredity and evolution are not limited to the natural genetic polymers of DNA and RNA.Pinheiro, V. B. et al. Synthetic genetic polymers capable of heredity and evolution. Science 336, 341-344, (2012). The high biological stability of TNA relative to other nucleic acid systems that are capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution, suggests that TNA is a strong candidate for the development of next-generation therapeutic aptamers. The mechanism of TNA synthesis by a laboratory evolved TNA polymerase has been studied using X-ray crystallography to capture the five major steps of nucleotide addition.Chim, N., Shi, C., Sau, S. P., Nikoomanzar, A. & Chaput, J. C. Structural basis for TNA synthesis by an engineered TNA polymerase. Nat. Commun. 8, 1810, (2017). These structures demonstrate imperfect recognition of the incoming TNA nucleotide triphosphate and support the need for further directed evolution experiments to create TNA polymerases with improved activity. The binary structure of a TNA reverse transcriptase has also been solved by X-ray crystallography, revealing the importance of structural plasticity as a possible mechanism for template recognition.Jackson, L. N., Chim, N., Shi, C. & Chaput, J. C. Crystal structures of a natural DNA polymerase that functions as an XNA reverse transcriptase. Nucleic Acids Res., (2019).  Pre DNA system  John Chaput, a professor in the department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, has theorized that issues concerning the prebiotic synthesis of ribose sugars and the non-enzymatic replication of RNA may provide circumstantial evidence of an earlier genetic system more readily produced under primitive earth conditions. TNA could have been an early genetic system and a precursor to RNA.Orgel, L. E. A simpler nucleic acid. Science 290, 1306-1307, (2000). TNA is simpler than RNA and can be synthesized from a single starting material. TNA is able to transfer back and forth information with RNA and with strands of itself that are complementary to the RNA. TNA has been shown to fold into tertiary structures with discrete ligand-binding properties.  Commercial applications  Although TNA research is still in its infancy, practical applications are already apparent. Its ability to undergo Darwinian evolution, coupled with its nuclease resistance, make TNA a promising candidate for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic applications that require high biological stability. This would include the evolution of TNA aptamers that can bind to specific small molecule and protein targets, as well as the development of TNA enzymes (threozymes) that can catalyze a chemical reaction. In addition, TNA is a promising candidate for RNA therapeutics that involve gene silencing technology. For example, TNA has been evaluated in a model system for antisense technology.Liu, L.

Jim Carrey stars as a man who becomes obsessed with the 23 enigma once he reads about it in a strange book that seemingly mirrors his own life. The film was released in the United States on February 23, 2007. This is the second film to pair Schumacher and Carrey, the first being Batman Forever. The film grossed $77.6 million, and has an approval rating of 8% on Rotten Tomatoes. Plot Walter Sparrow is an animal control officer married to Agatha; they have a son, Robin. At a bookstore, Agatha begins looking at a book titled The Number 23 written by Topsy Kretts. She later gives Walter the book as a birthday present. Walter starts reading the book, noticing odd similarities between himself and the main character, a detective who refers to himself as \\"Fingerling.\\" Mirroring the detective, Walter becomes obsessed with the 23 enigma, the idea that all incidents and events are directly connected to the number 23, or to some number connected to 23. When he tries to warn Agatha about the number, she tells him he is crazy. Walter's obsession leads him to believe that the book has secret insights into his own life. When he reads that Fingerling murders his girlfriend, Walter begins having dreams about murdering Agatha. Agatha refers him to her friend, Isaac French, who suggests Walter find the book's author if he wants answers. Walter's search leads him to discover the murder of Laura Tollins. Now believing the book to be a veiled confession, Walter searches for her killer. Evidence found at a psychiatric hospital reveals Walter in fact is Topsy Kretts, having written the book as a way to rid himself of the guilt he felt over murdering Tollins. He was never suspected of the crime, and a man named Kyle Flinch was convicted and imprisoned instead. Walter had dated Tollins 13 years earlier, but she left him for Flinch. Walter stabbed Tollins to death in a jealous rage and left the scene of the crime, moments before Flinch arrived and touched the knife, implicating himself in the murder. Wracked with guilt, Walter decided to kill himself and began writing a suicide note, but found that he could not stop writing; the note ultimately became the book. He survived his suicide attempt, but the resulting head trauma left him with amnesia. Fearing he will hurt his family, he leaves home and moves to the same hotel in which he had attempted suicide. Agatha finds Walter at the hotel and assures him that he is no longer the person he was when he wrote the book. He insists that he is a killer and tells Agatha to leave before he kills her, too. He leaves the hotel and runs into the street, where he nearly allows himself to be run over by a bus. Walter steps out of the way at the last minute when he realizes his son is watching. Walter turns himself in to the police and awaits sentencing, having been told that the judge will likely go easy on him. A funeral procession takes place in front of Tollins' grave, where it is implied her body has finally been laid to rest, as Flinch observes, a free man.

Hierapolis is located in the B√ºy√ºk Menderes (the classical Meander) valley adjacent to the modern Turkish cities of Pamukkale and Denizli. It is located in Turkey's inner Aegean region, which has a temperate climate for most of the year. Known as Pamukkale (Cotton Castle) or ancient Hierapolis (Holy City), this area has been drawing the weary to its thermal springs since the time of Classical antiquity. Pamukkale, meaning \\"cotton castle\\" in Turkish, is the natural formations inside the archaeological site. The area is famous for a carbonate mineral left by the flowing water. It is located in Turkey's Inner Aegean region, in the River Menderes valley, which has a temperate climate for most of the year. History The main street of Hierapolis Part of the archeological site of Hierapolis Ancient Hieropolis There are only a few historical facts known about the origin of the city. No traces of the presence of Hittites or Persians have been found. The Phrygians built a temple, probably in the first half of the 7th century BC. This temple, originally used by the citizens of the nearby town of Laodicea, would later form the centre of Hierapolis. Coin of Eumenes II Hierapolis was founded as a thermal spa early in the 2nd century BC within the sphere of the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus the Great sent 2,000 Jewish families to Lydia and Phrygia from Babylon and Mesopotamia, later joined by more from Judea. The Jewish congregation grew in Hierapolis and has been estimated as high as 50,000 in 62 BC.Padfield.com. \\"Jewish Congregation in Hierapolis\\". The city was expanded with the booty from the 190 BC Battle of Magnesia where Antiochus the Great was defeated by the Roman ally Eumenes II. Following the Treaty of Apamea ending the Syrian War, Eumenes annexed much of Asia Minor, including Hierapolis. Hierapolis became a healing centre where doctors used the thermal springs as a treatment for their patients. The city began minting bronze coins in the 2nd century BC. These coins give the name Hieropolis. It remains unclear whether this name referred to the original temple (, hieron) or honoured Hiera, the wife of Telephus, son of Heracles and the Mysian princess Auge, the supposed founder of Pergamon's Attalid dynasty. This name eventually changed into Hierapolis (\\"holy city\\"), according to the Byzantine geographer Stephanus on account of its large number of temples. Roman Hierapolis In 133 BC, when Attalus III died, he bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. Hierapolis thus became part of the Roman province of Asia. In AD 17, during the rule of the emperor Tiberius, a major earthquake destroyed the city. Through the influence of the Christian apostle Paul, a church was founded here while he was at Ephesus.Colossians 4:13. The Christian apostle Philip spent the last years of his life here.Papias. Early Christian Writings . The town's Martyrium was alleged to have been built upon the spot where Philip was crucified in AD 80. His daughters were also said to have acted as prophetesses in the region. The Agora In the year 60, during the rule of Nero, an even more severe earthquake left the city completely in ruins. Afterwards, the city was rebuilt in the Roman style with imperial financial support. It was during this period that the city attained its present form. The theatre was built in 129 for a visit by the emperor Hadrian. It was renovated under Septimius Severus (193‚Äì211). When Caracalla visited the town in 215, he bestowed the much-coveted title of neocoros upon it, according the city certain privileges and the right of sanctuary. This was the golden age of Hierapolis. Thousands of people came to benefit from the medicinal properties of the hot springs. New building projects were started: two Roman baths, a gymnasium, several temples, a main street with a colonnade, and a fountain at the hot spring. Hierapolis became one of the most prominent cities in the Roman Empire in the fields of the arts, philosophy, and trade. The town grew to 100,000 inhabitants and became wealthy. During his campaign against the Sassanid Shapur II in 370, the emperor Valens made the last-ever imperial visit to the city. During the 4th century, the Christians filled Pluto's Gate (a ploutonion) with stones, suggesting that Christianity had become the dominant religion and begun displacing other faiths in the area. Originally a see of Phrygia Pacatiana,RAMSAY, Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia (Oxford, 1895‚Äì1897) the Byzantine emperor Justinian raised the bishop of Hierapolis to the rank of metropolitan in 531. The Roman baths were transformed to a Christian basilica. During the Byzantine period, the city continued to flourish and also remained an important centre for Christianity. Medieval Hierapolis Pools in Hierapolis In the early 7th century, the town was devastated first by Persian armies and then by another destructive earthquake, from which it took a long time to recover. In the 12th century, the area came under the control of the Seljuk sultanate of Konya before falling to crusaders under Frederick Barbarossa and their Byzantine allies in 1190. About thirty years later, the town was abandoned before the Seljuks built a castle in the 13th century. The new settlement was abandoned in the late 14th century. In 1354, the great Thracian earthquake toppled the remains of the ancient city. The ruins were slowly covered with a thick layer of limestone. Later in 2020, city layer of limestone was broken and fixed after 2 months. Modern excavations Tomb of Philip the Apostle, Hierapolis Hierapolis was first excavated by the German archaeologist Carl Humann during June and July 1887. His excavation notes were published in his 1889 book Altert√ºmer von Hierapolis. His excavations were rather general and included a number of drilling holes. He would gain fame for his later discovery of the Pergamon Altar, which was reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. After the large white limestone formations of the hot springs became famous again in the 20th century, it was turned into a tourist attraction named \\"Cotton Castle\\" (Pamukkale). The ancient city was rediscovered by travellers, but also partially destroyed by new hotels that were built there. These buildings have been removed in recent years; however, the hot water pool of one hotel was retained, and (for a fee) it is possible to swim amongst ancient stone remains. Excavations began in earnest in 1957 when Italian scientists, led by Paolo Verzone, began working on the site. These studies continued into 2008 when a restoration of the site began. Large columns along the main street near the gate named for Domitian were erected again. A number of houses from the Byzantine period were also unearthed, including an 11th-century courtyard house. Many statues and friezes were transported to museums in London, Berlin, and Rome. In 1970, the Hierapolis Archaeology Museum was built on the site of the former Roman baths. Significant structures The Main Street and the gates The main street The Hellenistic city was built on a grid with streets running parallel or perpendicular to the main thoroughfare. This main street ran from north to south close to a cliff with the travertine terraces. It was about long and wide and was bordered on both sides by an arcade. At both ends of the main street, there was a monumental gate flanked by square towers built of massive blocks of stone. The side streets were about wide. Another gate, the Domitian Gate, was close to the northern city gate. This triumphal arch flanked by circular towers consists of three arches and was built by the proconsul Julius Frontinus (84‚Äì86). The town was repeatedly rebuilt following major earthquakes and improved prior to various imperial visits to the healing springs. In addition, Septimius Severus had a number of new buildings constructed in Hierapolis in gratitude for his secretary Antipater, a native of Hierapolis who also tutored the emperor's two sons. Frontinus Gate Frontinus Gate This is the monumental entrance to the Roman city and leads onto the large plateia, 14 m wide, which crosses the whole settlement, exiting a gate at the opposite side, to connect with the road that goes to Laodicea on the Lykos and then Colossae. It is worth admiring the well preserved structure with three openings, in carefully squared travertine blocks, with elegant arches decorated with a simple cornice moulding, flanked by two round towers that recall Hellenistic city Gates such as that of the Pamphilian city of Perge, near Antalya. North Byzantine Gate The north gate forms part of a fortification system built at Hierapolis in Theodosian times (late 4th century) and is its monumental entrance, matched by a symmetrical gate to the south of the city. Built of reused material from the demolition of the Agora, it is flanked by two square towers, as in other nearby cities such as Blaundus. Four large marble brackets with heads of lions, of panther and of a Gorgon were found collapsed in front of the gate. They are quite expressive and, whilst belonging to antique buildings, were evidently reused as apotropaic elements on the two sides of the gate so as to ward off evil influence. Theatre The Theatre was probably constructed under the reign of Hadrian after the earthquake of 60 AD. The facade is long, the full extent of which remains standing. In the cavea there are 50 rows of seats divided into seven parts by eight intermediate stairways. The diazoma, which divided the cavea into two, was entered by two vaulted passages (the vomitoria). There is an Imperial loge at the middle of the cavea and a 6-foot-high (1.83 m) wall surrounding the orchestra. The Theatre in 2010 During the reign of Septimius Severus at the beginning of the 3rd century, the old scaenae frons was replaced by a new, more monumental one, organized on three storeys and flanked by two imposing side entry buildings. Sculptural reliefs, displaying mythological subjects, were placed on the different storeys, while dedicatory inscriptions ran along the entablatures. The transformation was outstanding due to the size of the structures, the high quality of workmanship and materials employed.Filippo Masino, Giorgio Sobr√†, La frontescena severiana del Teatro di Hierapolis di Frigia. Architettura decorazione e maestranze, in Sebastiano Ramallo, Nicole R√∂ring (eds.) La scaenae frons en la arquitectura teatral romana, Cartagena 2010. The auditorium was rebuilt as well, substituting the ancient limestone seats with others in marble, and realizing a high podium on the orchestra in order to adapt the building to the organization of venationes and gladiator schools. An earthquake in Hierapolis in the 7th century caused the collapse of the entire building as well as the ultimate abandonment of the city. Since the 18th century, the monument's striking ruins have become a recurrent theme in European travellers‚Äô descriptions and engravings. Septimius Severus is portrayed in a relief together with his wife Julia Domna, his two sons Caracalla and Geta, and the god Jupiter. In AD 352, the orchestra was probably transformed into an arena for aquatic shows, which had become fashionable. The stage, which is high, had five doors and six niches. In front of these there were ten marble columns, decorated with alternate rectilinear and curved segments. The wall behind the scene was decorated with three rows of columns one behind another. The columns on the front row do not have grooves and stood on octagonal bases. The auditorium consisted of stacked seating with a capacity of 15,000 and was bisected by the main aisle. It featured an imperial box. The lower part originally had twenty rows and the upper part twenty five, but only thirty rows altogether have survived. The auditorium is segmented into nine aisles by means of eight vertical passageways with steps. The proscenium consisted of two stories with ornately decorated niches to the sides. Several statues, reliefs (including depictions of Apollo, Dionysus, and Diana), and decorative elements have been excavated by the Italian archaeological team and can be seen in the local museum. The theatre has been the object of important restorations between 2004 and 2014.Masino F., Projects for presentation and use of the theatre in Hierapolis, in Masino F., Mighetto P., Sobr√† G. (eds.) Restoration and management of ancient theatres in Turkey, 2012, 163‚Äì182. Temple of Apollo A temple was raised to Apollo Lairbenos, the town's principal god during the late Hellenistic period.Asia Minor Coins.com. \\"Coins of Hierapolis \\". This Apollo was linked to the ancient Anatolian sun god Lairbenos and the god of oracles Kareios. The site also included temples or shrines to Cybele, Artemis, Pluto, and Poseidon. Now only the foundations of the Hellenistic temple remain. The temple stood within a peribolos () in Doric style. The Sanctuary of Apollo The structures of the temple are later, though the presence of two Ionic capitals in the Museum (see under Museum), as well as of a Corinthian capital of the 1st century AD and other architectural fragments lead archaeologists to suppose the existence of an earlier temple on the site. The temple, which has a marble staircase, lies within a sacred area, about long. It was surrounded by an enclosure wall (temenos). The back of the temple was built against the hill, the peribolos was surrounded on the remaining southern, western and northern sides, by a marble portico, which has been partially excavated. This portico has pilasters bearing fluted Doric semi-columns supporting capitals that are decorated below with a row of astragali and beads and which, on the decorated below with a row of astragali and beads and which, on the echinus, bear a series of ovolos. The new temple was reconstructed in the 3rd century in Roman fashion, recycling the stone blocks from the older temple. The reconstruction had a smaller area and now only its marble floor remains. The temple of Apollo was deliberately built over an active fault. This fault was called the Plutonion. It was the oldest religious centre of the native community, the place where Apollo met with Cibele. It was said that only the priest of the Great Mother could enter the cave without being overpowered by the noxious underground fumes. Temples dedicated to Apollo were often built over geologically active sites, including his most famous, the temple at Delphi. When the Christian faith was granted official primacy in the 4th century, this temple underwent a number of desecrations. Part of the peribolos was also dismantled to make room for a large Nympheum. Ploutonion Next to this temple and within the sacred area is the oldest local sanctuary, Pluto's Gate, a ploutonion () or plutonium, which here means a shrine to the Greek god Pluto. This plutonion was described by several ancient writers, including Strabo, Cassius Dio, and Damascius. It is a small cave just large enough for one person to enter through a fenced entrance, beyond which stairs go down and from which emerges suffocating carbon dioxide gas caused by subterranean geologic activity. Behind the roofed chamber is a deep cleft in the rock, through which fast- flowing hot water passes while releasing a sharp-smelling gas. During the early years of the town, castrated priests of Cybele descended into the plutonion, crawling over the floor to pockets of oxygen or holding their breath. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and so tends to settle in hollows. The priests would then come up to show that they were miraculously immune to the gas and infused with divine protection.Pliny the Elder. Naturalis Historia, Book II, Ch. 95. An enclosed area of stood in front of the entrance. It was covered by a thick layer of suffocating gas, killing anyone who dared to enter it. The priests sold birds and other animals to the visitors, so that they could try out how deadly this enclosed area was. Visitors could (for a fee) ask questions of Pluto's oracle. This provided a considerable source of income for the temple. The entrance to the plutonion was walled off during the Christian times, from \\"Anatolia - A World Heritage\\", T.C. Ministry of Culture, P. 142ff.,, \\"Turkey Travel Guide\\", from Istanbul Hotels website, \\"Turkey Travel Guide\\", from Istanbul Hotels website, from Peten Tours (website reference no longer available) and has just been recently unearthed. The Nymphaeum Nymphaeum The Nymphaeum is located inside the sacred area in front of the Apollo temple. It dates from the 2nd century AD. It was a shrine of the nymphs, a monumental fountain distributing water to the houses of the city via an ingenious network of pipes. The Nymphaeum was repaired in the 5th century during the Byzantine era. A retaining wall was built with elements from the peribolos of the Apollonian temple. By doing so, the early Christians cut off the view of the pagan temple. The Byzantine gate was constructed in the 6th century. Now only the back wall and the two side walls remain. The walls and the niches in the walls were decorated with statues. The Italian archaeological team has excavated two statues of priestesses, which are now on display at the local museum. The Nymphaeum has a U-shaped plan and sits on the continuation of the main colonnaded road. The stone pavement columns and other architectural remains mark a great part of the colonnaded road which ran through the city in a north-south direction. It has statues and shops around it, underneath which passed canals. The road had a base covered with stone blocks, now under the pool of the Private Administration. There are two huge doors which were constructed at the end of the 1st century AD and left outside the city walls. Necropolis The Necropolis Beyond the city walls and meadow, following the main colonnaded road and passing the outer baths (thermae extra muros), an extensive necropolis extends for over on both sides of the old road to Phrygian Tripolis and Sardis. The other goes south from Laodikya to Closae. The necropolis extends from the northern to the eastern and southern sections of the old city. Most of the tombs have been excavated. This necropolis is one of the best preserved in Turkey. Most of about the 1,200 tombs were constructed with local varieties of limestone, though marble has been used, as well. Most tombs date from the late Hellenic period, but there are also a considerable number from the Roman and early Christian periods. People who came for medical treatment to Hierapolis in ancient times and the native people of the city buried their dead in tombs of several types according to their traditions and socio-economic status. The tombs and funeral monuments can be divided into four types: #Simple graves for common people #Sarcophagi, some raised on a substructure and others hollowed out from the rock. Many are covered with a double-pitched roof. Most are constructed in marble and are decorated with reliefs and epitaphs showing the names and professions of the deceased and extolling their good deeds. These epitaphs have revealed much about the population. Most, however, have been plundered over the years. #Circular tumuli, sometimes hard to discern. These mounds each have a narrow passageway leading to a vaulted chamber inside. #Larger family graves, sometimes monumental and resembling small temples. Northern Necropolis The monuments are situated in the large area, together with many travertine lahids, inscribed with Soros suffixes written in Greek (some over 2,000 years old) generally in the epigraphs on lahids. There are many architectural grave monuments in Hierapolis and they show different architectural techniques. The oldest graves are of the Hellenistic Period (1st and 2nd centuries BC), and are Tumulus graves, which are located on the east side of the foothill. The stone is cut properly limited to the drum cylinder which bonds the top of the burial chamber. The grave room is accessible from the corridor dramos. These tombs belonged to rich families. Poor families' tombs were carved into the rock and are simple. On the north side of the city, the graves made as the 2nd and the 3rd, are generally surrounded by walls and they have gardens decorated with flowers and trees (especially cypress). Grave monuments which are completely made of travertine, show different types; like simple lahids, and home kind graves which has two or more lahids on it. On the sarcophagus that holds the lahid, there is an inscription written in Greek (bomas, \\"altar\\"). \\"Bomas\\" was used as symbol which stresses that with the connection of a dead body of a person in high position, his or her remembrance will be exalted. These monuments have the same functions with heroon. (The grave monuments made for celebrating are for the heroes' and important persons‚Äô who are believed to become gods after they die.) water-driven Roman sawmill, depicted on the Sarcophagus of Marcus Aurelius Ammianos on the north necropolis. The 3rd century mill is the earliest known machine to incorporate a crank and connecting rod mechanism. =Sawmill= A raised relief on the Sarcophagus of a certain Marcus Aurelius Ammianos, a local miller, depicts the earliest known machine to incorporate a crank and connecting rod. On the pediment a waterwheel fed by a mill race is shown powering via a gear train two frame saws cutting rectangular blocks by the way of connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks (see diagram). The accompanying inscription is in Greek. In June 2014 the sarcophagus was stored at the Hierapolis Museum and not displayed. Southern Necropolis On the right side, fascinating signs of the earthquake can be seen. Large travertine area is completely demolished. The rectangle and hallow graves, which may be simpler and older than the necropolis, attracts attention. While digging, experts in Denizli Museum, found a grave with long inscriptions. Close to it, Epigraphic marble blocks had been founded which are dated to the Early Hellenistic Period. On the North side of the area, digging works are going on. On the hillside, Byzantine ramparts, on the grave builds, marble lahids had been founded. This lahids are staying on a stone base. The roof that built with cob brick is covered with tiles. This was a new style in this period, and inside the grave it is decorated with coloured wall paintings. On the way to Laodikeia and Colossae is another grave related to the Necropolis. This is the grave of Tiberius Cladius Talamos, whose name was written in the long epigraph, and it attracts attention due to the resemblance of its facade to a home.  Martyrium  The St. Philip Martyrium stands on top of the hill outside the northeastern section of the city walls. It dates from the 5th century. It was said that Philip was buried in the center of the building and, though his tomb has recently been unearthed, the exact location has not yet been verified. The Martyrium burned down at the end of the 5th or early 6th century, as attested by fire marks on the columns. Philip is said to have been martyred in Hierapolis by being crucified upside-down or by being hung upside down by his ankles from a tree. Martyrium The martyrium is usually taken to have been named after the Christian apostle Philip, but from early times there has been some dispute as to the actual identity of \\"Philip of Hierapolis\\". This confusion started with a report by Polycrates of Ephesus in his Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History and in his controversial letter written to Victor of Rome towards the end of the 2nd century. In the letter, he reports that the graves of Philip \\"of the twelve apostles\\", and of his two aged virgin daughters were in (the Phrygian) Hierapolis; a third daughter, \\"who had lived in the Holy Ghost\\", was buried at Ephesus. With this may be compared the testimony of Clement of Alexandria, who incidentally speaks of \\"Philip the Apostle\\" as having begotten children and as having given daughters in marriage. On the other hand, Proclus, one of the interlocutors in the \\"Dialogue of Caius\\", a writing of somewhat later date than the letter of Polycrates, mentions \\"four prophetesses, the daughters of Philip at Hierapolis in Asia, whose tomb and that of their father are to be seen there\\", where the mention of the daughters prophesying identifies the person meant with the Philip of Acts.Acts 6:1‚Äì7; 21:8‚Äì9. Early traditions say this Philip was martyred by hanging in Phrygia. and was also known as \\"Philip the Apostle\\". The reasons for setting aside the evangelist identification, and for holding that the Philip who lived at Hierapolis was the Apostle are stated by Lightfoot, Colossians (2).note 3, p. 45 seq Fresh confirmation of his view was afforded by the discovery of an inscription at Hierapolis, showing that the church there was dedicated to the memory \\"of the holy and glorious apostle and theologian Philip.\\"Early traditions say this Philip was martyred by hanging in Phrygia. and was also known as \\"Philip the Apostle\\". The martyrium had a special design, probably executed by an architect of a Byzantine emperor. It has a central octagonal structure with a diameter of under a wooden dome which is covered with lead tiles. This is surrounded with eight rectangular rooms, each accessible via three arches. Four were used as entrances to the church, the other four as chapels. The space between the eight rooms was filled with heptagonal chapels with a triangular apse. The dome above the apse was decorated with mosaics. The whole structure was surrounded by an arcade with marble columns. All the walls were covered with marble panels. In 2011, it was announced that Philip's gravesite may have been discovered about from the Martyrium. Antique Pool Especially in the period of the Roman Empire, Hierapolis and its site were a health center. In those years, thousands of people used to come to the baths, of which there are more than fifteen, and they found their remedy in those baths. Today's Antique Pool was shaped by the earthquake which happened in the 7th century AD. The marble portico with Ionic arrangement fell into the spring during that earthquake. Cleopatra's Pool The water in the thermal pool is 36‚Äì57 ¬∞C, pH value is 5.8 and radon value is 1480 pCi/l. The spa water contains bicarbonate, sulphate and carbon dioxide, as well as iron and radioactive combination. The water in this spring is suitable for taking showers and drinking cures, 2430 MG/liter melt metal value. The Baths Another set of baths was constructed outside the north gate at the beginning of the 3rd century AD. This building was converted into a church in the early Christian era (th century). It is apparent that the building had stuccoed, vaulted ceilings and that the halls were decorated with marble slabs. Museum The Roman Bath, now the Hierapolis Archaeology Museum The Roman Bath, one of the biggest buildings of Hierapolis antique city, has been used as the site of the Hierapolis Archaeology Museum since 1984. In this museum, alongside the historical artifacts which were found in Hierapolis, there are some artifacts from Laodiceia, Colossae, Tripolis, Attuda and other towns of the Lycos (√á√ºr√ºksu) valley. In addition to these, the museum has a large section devoted to artifacts found at Beycesultan H√ºy√ºk and which includes some of the most beautiful examples of Bronze Age craft. Artifacts which have come from the Caria, Pisidia and Lydia regions are also on display in this museum. The museum's exhibition space consists of three closed areas of the Hierapolis Bath and open areas in the eastern side, which are known to have been used as the library and the gymnasium. The artifacts in the open exhibition space are mostly marble and stone. Tombs and Statues Gallery Sarcophagi in the Museum This room contains finds from the excavations in Hierapolis and Laodiceia, including sarcophagi, statues, gravestones, pedestals, pillars and inscriptions. Among these artifacts there are statues of Tyche, Dionysus, Pan, Asklepios, Isis, Demeter and Trion which, although executed by the Romans, were inspired by the Hellenistic tradition. The representations of local customs on family tombs are particularly interesting. The most beautiful examples of baked earth sarcophagi are specific to this area. One of the most valuable works of art in this room is the sarcophagus belonging to a certain Arhom, of the 'Sidemare' type. On it is an inscription to Maximilian, and it is the finest work to emerge from the ancient towns of Lahdi and Laodicia. Small Artifacts Gallery In this room, there are small findings from several civilizations of the last 4,000 years. These works, which are displayed in chronological order include works from many archaeological sites in and around Denizli. A special importance is given to the findings from Beycesultan H√∂y√ºk. These discoveries are an example of an ancient civilization. These works, which were found in the excavation conducted by the British Institute of Archaeology include idols, baked earth bowls, libation cups, seals and other stone artifacts. In other parts of the room are displayed objects from the Frigan, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine period such as glass cups, necklaces, gemstones (in the form of rings, bracelets, earrings and so on) and earthenware lamps. This room also contains an important sequence of ancient coins arranged in chronological order. The earliest of these coins were minted in the 6th century AD and the display proceeds through the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Sel√ßuk and Ottoman periods with coins of gold, silver and bronze. Theater's Ruins Gallery In this room, decorative works from the theater of Hierapolis, most of which have been restored, are displayed. Some of the reliefs of the scenery building remain in site but parts of them have been replaced by copies. In the works that are found in the room there are reliefs devoted to the myth of Apollo and Artemis, the delights of Dionysos and the coronotion of the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus. There are depictions of the abduction of Persephone by Hades, Apollo, Leto, Artemis, and Hades and sculpted sphinxes. Sculpted relief reminiscent of Attalus and Eumenes are on display. Inscriptions describing the coronation of the goddess Hierapolis and decisions of the assembly concerning the theater may be seen.

This anthology series aired in syndication from the 1950s through the 1980s. The series was originally produced by the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, and distributed by the International Lutheran Laymen's League. Format This Is the Life used two formats for its nearly 40-year run. However, the main core of the series remained the same: presenting everyday and contemporary problems, and resolving them using a Christian solution. Even during the 1950s, topics often were controversial: censorship, morality, bigotry and racism, infidelity, juvenile delinquency, war (including the Vietnam War) and drug abuse. Some stories were light comedy, although most were serious. 1952-1956: The Fisher Family The series began under the title The Fisher Family, and premiered on the DuMont Television Network in September 1952, and aired on both DuMont and ABC until the fall of 1953. The show entered syndication shortly after its network run ended. The show's stories revolved around the Fishers, a typical family from Middleburg in an unnamed Midwestern state. The family included Carl, the father, who was a pharmacist; Anna, the mother (though they were referred to only as Mr. and Mrs. Fisher); their children Emily (18), Pete (16), and Freddie (10); and Grandpa Fisher (presumably Mr. Fisher's widower father), who lived with them. A recurring character was Pastor Martin, who presided over the Lutheran church where the Fishers were members. Each episode presented a difficult life issue for one or more of the Fishers (or sometimes, the people they encountered); the issue's resolution was found through their Christian faith. Pastor Martin would facilitate this resolving process when the family (or other central character for that particular episode) was unable to do so among themselves. Christian faith as the basis of a strong, functional family was the theme tying the episodes together. The show came to an end in the spring of 1956 and evolved into the spinoff series entitled This Is the Life. 1956-late 1980s: This Is the Life Replacing The Fisher Family in the fall of 1956, This Is the Life spun off from the former by means of Pastor Martin, who now became the only regular character on the show. The Fishers no longer appeared, but rather a variety of parishioners and other residents of or visitors to Middleburg. The series thus became, in terms of principal characters, an anthology; Christian practice and faith as the means of resolving each episodes principal(s) remained the underlying theme of the series, but by expanding the focus to different characters, a range of problems apart from just those facing a single, nuclear Christian family could be explored, e.g.: * A businessman must help his drug-addicted sister, but only after he faces his own drug habit. * A young girl runs away after learning her family is moving to another town because her father accepted a job transfer. * A college student struggles with grief after losing his girlfriend in a car accident. * An ex-con trying to reintegrate into the work force sees a question on his job application he has difficulty being honest about. The characters were not necessarily Lutheran, devout Christians, or even Christians at all. They would ultimately be able to face their difficulties, however, by either turning or returning to Christianity, here in the form of Pastor Martin. Generally, the episode was introduced by Pastor Martin, telling the story of a past event to illustrate a point of doctrine. Generally, he thereafter did not appear in the episode until the crisis came to a head, usually as a consultant turned to by each episode's characters when they had exhausted their own and other \\"secular\\" resources. When Nelson Leigh, who had played that role from The Fisher Family days, retired, other Lutheran ministers replaced him and the minister's role as \\"host\\" of the program was dropped. The show continued into the late 1980s, though generally broadcast in its last years mostly on local or cable Christian networks, and videotaped rather than filmed. The move away from a single, central character, even if only briefly seen, along with the rise in televangelism bringing competing shows to the air, and individual religious networks where the lectures of individual personalities were promoted instead of the broad lessons via a teleplay for all of the past, may have contributed to the series' loss of audience. At some point in its later years, some of the episodes were repackaged and reissued with a different title, Patterns For Living. At times, the editing for doing so was somewhat sloppy, such that the This Is the Life title was still evident. The series appears to be \\"lost\\" now, or at least suppressed by the current rights' holder(s); beyond runs on some public access stations which continue to run tapes of the series received in the past, no re-syndication of any of its seasons or episodes in the past two decades is known, and it has never been available on home video. Legacy The success of This Is the Life resulted in several other Christian denominations producing their own religious anthology series. The most successful of these entries was Insight, which was produced by the Roman Catholic-affiliated Paulist Productions, premiering in syndication in 1960 and running for nearly 25 years. Among less-successful anthologies were: * This Is the Answer (1958-1961), underwritten by the Southern Baptist Convention. * The Pastor (1955), the Methodists' entry into the market.

Hamilton (born Johannes √ì hUrmoltaigh, 28 January 1953) is an Irish writer. Life Hamilton's mother was a German Roman Catholic who travelled to Ireland in 1949 on a pilgrimage, married an Irishman, and settled in the country. His father was a strict nationalist who insisted that his children should speak only German or Irish, but not English, a prohibition the young Hugo resisted inwardly. \\"The prohibition against English made me see that language as a challenge. Even as a child I spoke to the walls in English and secretly rehearsed dialogue I heard outside,\\" he wrote later.Hugo Hamilton, \\"Speaking to the walls in English\\", Powells.com, undated. As a consequence of this, he grew up with three languages ‚Äì English, Irish and German ‚Äì and a sense of never really belonging to any: \\"There were no other children like me, no ethnic groups that I could attach myself to\\". Hamilton became a journalist, and then a writer of short stories and novels. His first three novels were set in Central Europe. Following a year spent in Berlin on a DAAD cultural scholarship, he completed his memoir of childhood, The Speckled People (2003), which went on to achieve widespread international acclaim. Telling the story through the eyes of his childhood self, it evoked the struggle to make sense of a bizarre 'language war' in which the child perceives going out onto the English speaking street outside as a daily migration. It \\"triumphantly avoids ... sentimental nostalgia and victim claims\\"Ôºåwrote Hermione Lee in The Guardian \\"The cumulative effect is to elevate an act of scrupulous remembering into a work of art,\\" commented James Lasdun in the New York Times. The story is picked up in the 2006 volume, The Sailor in the Wardrobe. In May 2007, German publisher Luchterhand published Die redselige Insel (The Island of Talking), in which Hamilton retraced the journey Heinrich B√∂ll made in Ireland that was to be the basis of his best-selling book Irisches Tagebuch (Irish Journal) in 1957. His fellow Irish writer Anne Enright has described Hamilton a writer who \\"loves the spaces between things: his characters live, not just between cultures or between languages, but between the past and the future.\\" Hamilton's 2014 novel, Every Single Minute is a fictional account of a journey to Berlin which the author undertook with his fellow writer and memoirist, Nuala O Faolain, who was dying of cancer. Hugo Hamilton lives in Dublin. In 1992 he was awarded the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. Sang impur, the French translation of The Speckled People, won the Prix Femina √©tranger in 2004 and Il cane che abbaiava alle onde, the Italian translation of the memoir, won the Premio Giuseppe Berto in 2004. He adapted his memoir The Speckled People for the stage at the Gate Theatre in Dublin in 2011. A new play entitled The Mariner, based on the story of his grandfather returning from the First World War, ran at the Gate Theatre in 2014. Hamilton is a member of Aosd√°na and has been awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany) for his unique contribution to literature and understanding between Germany and Ireland.

He travels from being a young boy playing war with his friends to a semi-god still playing war, but with a universe at stake. Godlike powers were withdrawn from most humans after a catastrophic war between 'human gods' almost destroyed humanity itself. A small subset of selected families were permitted to retain these powers in the service of humanity. Each family was born from a small number of individuals, chosen after competitive selection and extensive and exhaustive vetting. Each family had psychological tendencies that predisposed its work for humanity to follow certain directions. The tensions between families erupt when the drive to 'improve' unleashes forces which threaten death and destruction on a galactic scale.

The period is known as the \\"Black Fives Era\\" or \\"Early Black Basketball\\" or simply \\"Black Basketball\\". Early basketball teams were often called \\"fives‚Äù in reference to the five starting players. All-black teams were known as colored quints, colored fives, Negro fives, or black fives. Dozens of all-black teams emerged during the Black Fives Era, in New York City, Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and other cities. They were sponsored by or affiliated with churches, athletic clubs, social clubs, businesses, newspapers, YMCA branches, and other organizations. The terms \\"Black Fives\\" and \\"Black Fives Era\\" are trademarked phrases owned by Black Fives, Inc., whose founder and owner, Claude Johnson, coined the terms while researching and promoting the period's history.  Washington and New York origins  Edwin Henderson is considered the \\"Grandfather of Black Basketball.\\" He was a black gym teacher who is credited with being the first to introduce the game of basketball to African Americans in a wide scale organized way, in the winter of 1904 in Washington, D.C., through physical education classes in the district's racially segregated public school system. It was 13 years after basketball was invented. Henderson had learned the sport while taking summer classes in physical training at Harvard University. He envisioned basketball not as an end in itself but as a public-health and civil-rights tool. Henderson believed that, by organizing black athletics, including basketball, it would be possible to send more outstanding black student athletes to excel at northern white colleges and debunk negative stereotypes of the race. He reasoned that in sports, unlike politics and business, the black race would get a fair chance to succeed. According to Henderson, the relatively new sport was not an immediate hit with his students. ‚ÄúAmong blacks, basketball was at first considered a ‚Äòsissy‚Äô game, as was tennis in the rugged days of football,‚Äù he later wrote.Black Basketball's Direct Link To Hemenway Gymnasium In Boston (Part II), (c) 2003‚Äì2012 Black Fives, Inc. In 1906, Henderson co- founded (along with Garnet Wilkinson of the M Street High School and W. A. Joiner of Howard University, as well as W. A. Decatur and Robert Mattingly of Armstrong Technical High School) the Inter-Scholastic Athletic Association of Middle Atlantic States, an amateur sports organization designed to encourage competition among intercollegiate and interscholastic athletes, in track and field as well as in basketball. Subsequently, several all-black basketball teams made up of players from public schools, athletic clubs, churches, colleges, and Colored YMCAs began to emerge in the Washington, DC area. Simultaneously, basketball was catching on among African Americans in New York City, and these two urban centers served as the early incubators of the black game. The first independent African American basketball team in the history of the sport was the Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn, which was organized in 1907. This team promptly won the first \\"Colored Basketball World's Championship\\"‚Äîa title coined by African American sportswriters to honor the best all-black basketball team, by their informal consensus, for the 1907‚Äì08 season. The first inter-city competition between two African American basketball teams took place on December 18, 1908, when the Smart Set Athletic Club traveled to Washington, DC to play the Crescent Athletic Club. Brooklyn won the game.100 Year Anniversary of First Black Inter-City Basketball Game, (c) 2003‚Äì2012 Black Fives, Inc. The first all-black pay-for-play team was the New York All-Stars, formed in the fall of 1910 by former St. Christopher Club manager Major A. Hart. Hart wrote: \\"That this game has taken a firm hold on our people has been demonstrated beyond a doubt. Now it is up to the players and their friends [to advance the black game] by not only forming a basketball league among the teams, but playing good, fast, clean games, eliminating therefrom all petty jealousies, quarrels and the little meannesses that have a tendency to disgust the people who assemble to witness these contests. We want to play the game as our white friends play it. That is, in the spirit of fairness and for the benefits that the exercise will give us and the enjoyment we can afford to our friends.\\" Hart clearly envisioned basketball as entertainment and therefore as an opportunity to create revenue‚Äînot just as physical education. Like Henderson and the 12th Street YMCA team, he recognized that a winning team of all-star performers would help further popularize the game among African-Americans in New York.  Early days  By the 1912‚Äì13 season, inter-city competition had become a staple of the black game. No longer did facing the best teams mean making a three-day trip to Washington or New York. Inter-city competition had grown in just four seasons into an expanding network of towns and cities that also included Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, Baltimore and Atlantic City, and the college campuses of Howard, Hampton and Lincoln. In a few more seasons, the network would extend into the Midwest and New England. The black game also had begun to develop a deeper pool of talent. At Harlem's St. Christopher Club, where teams were said to have the luxury of practicing \\"two hours a day regularly\\", the seeds already had been sown for the next great New York team. At Hampton University in Virginia, another outstanding college team was in the making under the direction of physical educator Charles Holston Williams. At the same time, a boom in the construction of YMCAs for black men was under way, which would have a profound impact on the training of young players in cities throughout the country. But in 1913, the black game's two best teams were the Howard Big Five and Pittsburgh's champion Monticello Athletic Association. The Howard University team clearly had more talent and greater cohesion, with most of its stars having played four seasons together. George Gilmore was the best center in the black game, Ed Gray was the best defender, and Hudson Oliver was probably the second-best player overall. The title of best player overall belonged to Monticello's Cum Posey. According to some, Posey stood shoulder to shoulder with Paul Robeson, John Henry Lloyd, Oscar Charleston and other great black baseball and football players as the finest athlete of his generation. \\"Giants crumpled and quit before the fragile-looking Posey\\", recalled W. Rollo Wilson of the Pittsburgh Courier in the late 1920s. \\"He was at once a ghost, a buzz saw, and a 'shooting fool'. The word 'quit' has never been translated for him.\\"  The Professional Game  Black professional basketball in America, begun by Major Hart and the New York All Stars in 1910, began to grow and flourish in the 1920s. In 1922, the McMahon brothers established the Commonwealth Big 5 to play at their venue, the Commonwealth Casino on East 135th Street in Harlem. A year later, Robert Douglas, a resident of New York City who had emigrated from the British West Indies in about 1902, founded the Rens-‚Äìthe Renaissance Big Five. The Commonwealth Big 5 won most of the contests between the two teams, but did not draw large crowds, and the McMahons shut down the team after two years, leaving the Rens to become one of the sport's top draws in white and black America alike.Stephen Robertson, \\"Basketball in 1920s Harlem\\", Digital Harlem Blog, June 3, 2011. Accessed August 23, 2011. The Rens were named after the Renaissance Casino and Ballroom in Harlem, where they played their first game on November 3, 1923, a 28‚Äì22 victory over a white team called the Collegiate Five. The ballroom was owned by Sarco Realty Company and William Roach, who allowed the dance floor to double as a basketball court to accommodate Douglas's team. It was far from an ideal site for basketball, preceding the era of the beautiful, tailor-made arenas of today's game. \\"It was rectangular, but more box-like,\\" said former Rens star Pop Gates, arguably the best player of his day and a Hall of Fame inductee. \\"They set up a basketball post on each end of the floor. The floor was very slippery and they outlined the sidelines and foul lines. It wasn't a big floor. It was far from being a regular basketball floor. Other than high schools or armories, they had very few places to play at, except the Negro college. It was a well-decorated area ‚Äì chandeliers, a bandstand. All the big [dance bands] played the Renaissance ‚Äì Fatha Hines, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Chick Webb's band. They had the dancing before the ball game. People would pay and [dance] prior to the game, at halftime, and after the game.\\" Because the basketball games were, essentially, part of an evening of entertainment and fun, that led to Black Fives Era teams having to develop a faster-paced more entertaining game that involved more athletic and daring styles of play. Flashiness was considered an essential part of the game, not the self-glorifying aberration it was considered in the white game. Dance halls lost their popularity in the late 1920s and early 1930s when the Depression strangled the economy and deprived people of spare cash. According to Susan J. Rayl, lagging attendance convinced Douglas to send his team on the road in 1928 in the northeast; by the 1930 season the Rens were playing games throughout the Midwest.Susan Rayl, The New York Renaissance Professional Black Basketball Team (PhD dissertation), Pennsylvania State University, 1996, pp. 124, 147, 175. In 1933, they began barnstorming the South. Beginning in 1931, he had assembled a team so skilled that it was nicknamed the Magnificent Seven because of the excellence of its key players: Charles \\"Tarzan\\" Cooper, Clarence \\"Fat\\" Jenkins, John \\"Casey\\" Holt, James \\"Pappy\\" Ricks, Eyre \\"Bruiser\\" Saitch, William \\"Wee Willie\\" Smith and Bill Yancey. The highlight of the Rens' long history was an 88-game winning streak from January 1, 1933, through a game on March 27, 1933, when they lost to the Original Celtics. From 1932 to 1936, the Rens had a remarkable 497‚Äì58 record. \\"Our basketball heroes were the New York Rens and I used to see them play,\\" Gates said. \\"I'd sneak in or get 50 cents to watch them play.\\" He also had seen them practice because the Harlem YMCA, where Gates played ball as a youngster, was a practice site for the Rens. The Rens would leave New York for months at a time, traveling thousands of miles and playing every night and twice on Sundays. Sometimes they slept on their bus because they couldn't find a place to stay under the prevailing Jim Crow laws. Once, an Indiana restaurant owner put a tall screen around the team's table to segregate the Rens from other customers. John Isaacs, a standout player for the Rens in the 1930s credited with bringing the pick-and-roll play to the professional game, walked out. He sat in the bus and made a meal of salami on Ritz crackers. On the court, the Rens faced hostile crowds, ruthless name calling and overtly biased referees. Their motto on the road was \\"Get 10,\\" meaning that they wanted to come out and grab a quick 10-point lead. \\"That was the 10 the officials were going to take away from you,\\" Isaacs recalls. In 1939, the Rens went 112‚Äì7, swept into Chicago and beat a top white pro team, the Oshkosh All-Stars, to win the first ever world championship tournament.  Latter days  In the 1940s, when the National Basketball Association's predecessor leagues were not much of a fan draw, the leagues stayed alive by staging doubleheaders with the Harlem Globetrotters, which had emerged from the Black Five league in Chicago. The Rens and other barnstormers helped nurture and popularize the game that is now an international, multibillion-dollar industry. John Isaacs, who played with the Rens from 1936 to 1940, earned $150 a month plus $3 a day meal money after signing with the Rens out of high school. \\"We enjoyed it and played it as a sport,\\" Isaacs said. Today, pro basketball \\"is about money.\\" In the 1940s, the Globetrotters emerged as a team that was as dominant as the Rens were. However the Globetrotters never agreed to play the Rens after losing to them in their only meeting. The Black Fives era ended in the late 1940s with the gradual integration of white professional basketball leagues, led by the National Basketball League. When the NBL merged with the all-white and racially segregated Basketball Association of America in 1949, they formed the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 1950 the NBA signed its first African American players. Early black players in the NBA experienced continual racism and racial tension from fans, teammates, opposing players, coaches, referees, and owners. However, they persevered and the situation gradually became easier as the league drafted more and more African Americans. Nonetheless, even those who made the NBA after integration began were forced to be role players, concentrating on rebounding and defense. Black pros did not get a chance to showcase their talents in the league until the arrival of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. In 1963, the 1933 version of the Rens team was collectively named to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Only their arch-rivals, the Original Celtics, and the Buffalo Germans received the same honor. The Rens' selection was well-deserved, for despite traveling and playing throughout America when the harsh effect of segregation was common and often legal, they compiled a 2318‚Äì381 record before the team folded in 1949. In 2005, the 109th United States Congress passed a joint resolution that \\"recognizes the teams and players of the barnstorming African-American basketball teams for their achievement, dedication, sacrifices, and contribution to basketball and to the nation prior to the integration of the white professional leagues.\\"Bill Summary and Status ...

It is the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Parma. It is an important Italian Romanesque cathedral: the dome, in particular, is decorated by a highly influential illusionistic fresco by Renaissance painter Antonio da Correggio. History The construction was begun in 1059 by bishop Cadalo, later antipope with the name of Honorius II, and was consecrated by Paschal II in 1106. A basilica existed probably in the 6th century, but was later abandoned; another church had been consecrated in the rear part of the preceding one in the 9th century by the count-bishop Guibodo. The new church was heavily damaged by an earthquake in 1117 and had to be restored. Of the original building, remains can be seen in the presbytery, the transept, the choir and the apses, and in some sculpture fragments. The wide fa√ßade was completed in 1178: it has three loggia floors and three portals, whose doors were sculpted by Luchino Bianchino in 1494. Between the central and the right doors is the tomb of the mathematician Biagio Pelacani, who died in 1416. The Gothic belfry was added later, in 1284-1294: a twin construction on the left side had been conceived, but it was never begun. Beside the Cathedral lies the octagonal Baptistery of Parma. Interior Interior The interior has a Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles divided by pilasters. The presbytery and the transept are elevated, to allow space for the underlying crypt. The latter houses fragments of ancient mosaics which show the presence here of a cult temple from at least in the 3rd or 4th century AD. The side chapels were built to house the sepulchers of the noble families of Parma: two of them, the Valeri Chapel and the Commune Chapel, have maintained the original decoration from the 14th century. Particularly noteworthy are the capitals, also in the exterior: many of them are characterized by rich decorations with leaves, mythological figures, scenes of war, as well as Biblical and Gospel scenes. The paintings, as revealed by a capital stripped of the 16th century gold painting, were originally polychrome. In the right transept is the Deposition by Benedetto Antelami (1178). The cycle of frescoes in the nave and apse walls are by Lattanzio Gambara and Bernardino Gatti. Along the nave, in the lunettes above the spans are monochrome frescoes of Old Testament stories, as well as event of the passion. This culminates in the apse cupola, frescoed with ‚Äò‚ÄôChrist, Mary, Saints, and Angels in Glory‚Äô‚Äô (1538‚Äì1544) by Girolamo Mazzola Bedoli. The 15th-century frescoes in the Valeri Chapel are attributed to the studio of Bertolino de'Grossi. Those in the Capella del Comune, presumably by the same hands, were painted after the plague of 1410‚Äì11, and dedicated to Saint Sebastian. The Crypt has a monument to Saint Bernardo di Uberti, bishop of Parma 1106‚Äì1133, patron of the diocese. The monument, executed in the 1544 by Prospero Clementi and Girolamo Clementi on design of Mazzola B√®doli. The sacristy contains works attributed to Luchino Bianchini (1491). There are four reliefs by Benedetto Antelami, from 1178. The portal also has two carvings by Luchino Bianchino. Two great marble lions support the archivolt columns, and were carved in the 1281 by Giambono da Bissone. The Ravacaldi chapel has frescoes attributed to the studio of Bertolino de‚ÄôGrassi. The main feature of the interior is the fresco of Assumption of the Virgin decorating the dome, executed by Correggio in 1526‚Äì1530.

Greenburg appears as the manager of a motel in the film. Private Lessons was one of Kristel's few major American film appearances; she was better known to European audiences for her Emmanuelle films which had only limited distribution in the United States. In early 2006, a 25th anniversary DVD release was issued in North America.  Plot  Philip \\"Philly\\" Fillmore (Eric Brown) is a 15-year- old high school student and the son of a rich businessman in Albuquerque, who has left town on an extended trip during summer break, leaving the young man in the passing care of Nicole Mallow (Sylvia Kristel), a sexy French housekeeper, and Lester Lewis (Howard Hesseman), the family's chauffeur. Philly becomes infatuated with Nicole. When she spots him peeping into her room, she tells him to close her door. To Philly's utter shock, she means for him to close her door from the inside and then watch her undress. However, it is too much for him when a topless Nicole asks him to touch her breasts. When he objects, she steps back and instead takes off her panties. Philly panics and leaves. Later on, he is surprised to find her in his father's bathtub. Once again to his amazement, she asks him to join her. At first he objects, but instead she keeps sweet-talking him until he finally gives in. However, he decides to wear swimming trunks. Once in the bathtub, she spoons and kisses him from behind. When she tries to take off his swimming trunks from behind, he insists that she turn off the lights first. But once she reaches for his crotch, he again panics and rushes out. She follows him to apologize, kisses him and directly invites him to sleep with her, the sexual element of which he fails to comprehend at first. After they flirt in a movie theater the following day, he gives in but backs down when she reacts without fondness to the notion of marrying him. One day later, she tells him she guesses they can at least date for a while. After they flirt during their first date in a restaurant, they return home and have sex. Nicole is revealed as an illegal alien; Lester is using this secret to blackmail her into helping him in a larger blackmail scheme against Philly. Lester intends that Nicole seduce Philly then fake her own death during intercourse. Lester would then \\"help\\" the panicked Philly to secretly bury Nicole. Her body would later disappear, and a note would order Philly to steal $10,000 from his father to prevent exposure of his role in Nicole's \\"death\\". When Nicole has second thoughts, Lester threatens to also expose her as a child molester. Nicole has truly fallen in love with Philly, and she reveals the truth to him. Philly convinces his tennis coach (Ed Begley Jr.) to pose as a police detective and intimidate Lester with questions about Nicole's disappearance. Lester panics but is caught with the money before he can flee the country. Nicole and Philly return the money to the safe, but they decide not to expose Lester's treachery. In turn, he reluctantly decides not to expose Nicole's illegal alien status nor her acts of child molestation, knowing that Philly could easily expose his attempted embezzlement scheme to his father and the police, and as a result, he keeps his job. Nicole fears that Philly's father will eventually discover their affair, and decides to leave. Before she does, she and Philly have intercourse one last time. Summer vacation ends and Philly returns to high school, thanks his teacher for advising him to pursue girls whose age is more appropriate for him and, in order to \\"discuss\\" this matter more closely, successfully asks her out to dinner.

Producer R. Ben Efraim would produce a number of additional Private... movies over the next decade, including 1983's Private School (which features a brief appearance by Kristel), and two in-name-only sequels to Private Lessons in 1993 and 1994. During the bedroom striptease, Judy Helden performed as the body double for Kristel. The film was financed primarily by Jack Barry & Dan Enright Productions, even though its two chief producers, Jack Barry and Dan Enright, were better known for their game shows on television, of which Barry was the host and Enright the primary producer. The company's announcer at the time, Jay Stewart, provided the narration for one of the movie trailers for the film. The film was also the first picture for Jensen Farley Pictures (a subsidiary of Sunn Classic Pictures), a movie studio founded by Rayland Jensen (founder of Sunn Classic Pictures) and his fellow employee, Clair Farley. Sunn, initially a subsidiary of the Schick razor company, would be sold to Taft Broadcasting in 1980, shortly before this film's release. Jensen Farley Pictures was created after the sale to Taft, and one of the company's early releases was a film produced by Taft, The Boogens, initially planned for release through Sunn. Jensen Farley would later release another sex comedy whose selling point was the promise of a young man coupled with an alluring older woman, Homework with Joan Collins. Director Alan Myerson and the cinematographer he hired, Jan de Bont, shot their principal photography for the film in Arizona and New Mexico. In 1985, the film was made in Italian as Il peccato di Lola, (Lola's Sin) starring Donatella Damiani.

G. Wodehouse. It first appeared in the United States in the 29 November 1924 issue of The Saturday Evening Post, and in the United Kingdom in the December 1924 issue of Strand Magazine. Part of the Blandings Castle canon, it features the absent-minded peer Lord Emsworth, and was included in the collection Blandings Castle and Elsewhere (1935), although the story takes place sometime between the events of Leave it to Psmith (1923) and Summer Lightning (1929).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 68‚Äì69, A53. Plot Lord Emsworth, enjoying the views around his castle with a telescope on the turret above the west wing, spies his younger son Freddie Threepwood kissing a girl in a spinney by the end of the water-meadow. Enraged, he confronts the young man, who reveals the girl is named Aggie, and is a \\"sort of cousin\\" of Head Gardener Angus McAllister. Emsworth demands that McAllister send the girl away, but the angered Scotsman hands in his notice. Realising that McAllister has gone, he realises that deputy head gardener, Robert Barker, is not up to the job of preparing his precious pumpkin, \\"The Hope of Blandings\\", for the Shrewsbury Show, Emsworth heads up to London to retrieve the man. Outside the Senior Conservative Club, he runs into Freddie, who, unable to get the subject of pumpkins out of his father's head, awkwardly hands him a note and runs off. Emsworth learns from the note that Freddie has married Aggie that morning. Despairing that his son has landed him with the cost of supporting a wife, Emsworth wanders into Kensington Gardens. Entranced by the flowers, he absent- mindedly picks a handful of tulips, arousing the wrath of a park-keeper. A police officer and crowd gather round, and Emsworth attempts to defend himself, but nobody believes a genuine Earl would dress so scruffily. Just in time, Angus McAllister turns up and confirms Emsworth's identity; he is accompanied by Mr Donaldson, who tells Lord Emsworth that he should be supportive of his son. Learning that Donaldson is a wealthy man and plans not only to take Freddie far away but also to put him to work, Emsworth is delighted, and gives his blessing warmly, sending Freddie a message \\"not to hurry home\\". Emsworth approaches McAllister humbly and offers to double his salary if he returns to the castle. He does, and soon afterwards the gargantuan Blandings Hope wins first prize.

The Alvord chub is a small fish, with adults ranging up to in length, but with many half that size. It is generally grayish-whitish, darker on the back than below, and with a faint band passing down the sides. The dorsal fin has 7 rays, the anal fin 8 rays, and the tail 19 rays. It is similar in many ways to the Borax Lake chub. Studies of the fish's diet shows it is an opportunistic feeder, consuming a variety of aquatic invertebrates, with a considerable percentage of midge larvae. It occupies a variety of habitats within its range, including waters of depths to , different bottoms including gravel and silt, and any amount of cover over the water. It can be found in warm springs, up to , but not in hot springs. Spawning season lasts from April to July. Although apparently doing well in its location, the species is considered vulnerable because of its very limited range in a fragile environment. Having evolved without any competition, there is concern over the possible effects of exotic fish introduction, whether deliberate or accidental. References * William F. Sigler and John W.

It comprises a section of the old Town of Brockton which was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1884. The town encompassed the area from Bloor Street on the north, Dufferin Street on the east, High Park on the west and ranged from Queen Street, along Roncesvalles Avenue, Wright Avenue and Dundas Street to the south. The section south of the rail lines became part of the Village of Parkdale. The section to the west of Lansdowne has become better known as Roncesvalles, around Roncesvalles Avenue. History In March 1812, Lot 30 in York Township, a parcel of land, was granted to James Brock, a cousin of Sir Isaac Brock along with other parcels of land. This lot was a strip of land that stretched from Lot Street, today's Queen Street, north to Bloor Street, west of Dufferin Avenue. 'Appii Forum', three taverns on Dundas Street at the tollgate in 1893. After Brock died, his widow Lucy Brock inherited his estate and she began selling the lands that Brock owned. She commissioned a roadway along the centre-line of the lot parcel, along its whole length. The road, built in 1850, is known today as Brock Avenue. The lands of lot 30 were sub-divided for small land-holders and development occurred. This unincorporated settlement took on the name of Brockton. The developed area of Brockton grew to border High Park on the west, Dufferin (then the border of Toronto) on the east, Bloor on the north and the rail-lines to the south-west by the time it was incorporated as a village in 1876. It became an incorporated town in 1881. The incorporated town only lasted three years before it was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1884. The area was home to Dufferin Racetrack from 1907 to 1956. From 1907 to 1956, the site was home to horse racing at Dufferin Racetrack. The track was later closed and converted to a shopping plaza. The plaza, Dufferin Mall, is an enclosed shopping centre to the south of Bloor Street, on the west side of Dufferin Avenue, and dominates shopping in the area with a large supermarket, department store, clothing and specialty stores. In the 1970s, the large parking lot was converted to a three-storey parking garage, and the number of stores doubled in conjunction with the enclosure of the pedestrian space. Brock Avenue was also home to an outdoor National Rink (located at baseball field in what is today's McCormick Arena), which was once considered for the new home of the Toronto Hockey Club but turned down as it was an outdoor facility. Over the last half of the 20th century, the area south of College Street saw the influx of Portuguese immigrants and is also known as part of the Little Portugal neighbourhood. Today's 'Brockton Village' encompasses that section north of the rail lines between Dufferin and Lansdowne, south of Bloor Street. Today, remnants of the former Brockton still exist, including its former town hall. The hall was converted to commercial usage, and is located at the south-west corner of Dundas Street West and Brock Avenue. Until recently, there was Brockton High School, which hadn't functioned as that high school for years. It was once Ursula Franklin Academy, it was used by the Royal Conservatory of Music's bookstore, and it was used by FoodShare. In 2019 it was torn down completely. In May 2020 the lot was transformed into Bloordale Beach. It's located at Brock Avenue and Croatia Street, near Bloor Street. Education Bloor Collegiate Institute is one of three public secondary schools in Brockton Village. Four public school boards operate in Brockton Village, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). TDSB is a secular public school board that operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, Bloor Collegiate Institute. In addition to Bloor Street, TDSB also operates three elementary schools, Brock Public School, Kent Senior Public School, and Shirley Street Junior Public School. TCDSB is a separate public school board that operates one elementary school in the neighbourhood, St. Helen Catholic School. CSCM and CSV are French first language public school boards, the former being a separate school board, whereas the latter is a secular school board. Both school boards operate one secondary school in Brockton Village, CSCM operates √âcole secondaire catholique Saint-Fr√®re-Andr√©, while CSV operates √âcole secondaire Toronto Ouest. Both schools share the same building, formerly used by West Toronto Collegiate Institute.

GNA is not known to occur naturally; they are synthesized chemically. The 2,3-dihydroxypropylnucleoside analogues were first prepared by Ueda et al. (1971). Soon thereafter it was shown that phosphate- linked oligomers of the analogues do in fact exhibit hypochromicity in the presence of RNA and DNA in solution (Seita et al. 1972). The preparation of the polymers was later described by Cook et al. (1995, 1999) and Acevedo and Andrews (1996). The GNA-GNA self-pairing described by Zhang and Meggers is however novel, and the specificity of interaction well-demonstrated. DNA and RNA have a deoxyribose and ribose sugar backbone, respectively, whereas GNA's backbone is composed of repeating glycol units linked by phosphodiester bonds. The glycol unit has just three carbon atoms and still shows Watson-Crick base pairing. The Watson-Crick base pairing is much more stable in GNA than its natural counterparts DNA and RNA as it requires a high temperature to melt a duplex of GNA. It is possibly the simplest of the nucleic acids, making it a hypothetical precursor to RNA.

Sedat Alp (January 1, 1913 in Veroia - October 9, 2006 in Ankara) was the first Turkish archaeologist, historian and academic with a specialization in Hittitology, and was among the foremost names in the field. He was the president of the Turkish Historical Association from 1982 to 1983. Sedat Alp was born in Karaferye, present-day Veroia in Greece. His family moved to Turkey as a result of the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923. In 1932, he earned a state scholarship opened under the personal auspices of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk and was sent to the University of Leipzig (he later transferred to the University of Berlin) to study prehistory, history, Hittitology, Sumerology, Assyriology, ancient Anatolian languages and cultures, as well as archaeology in general. Having earned his doctorate in the University of Berlin, he returned to Turkey in 1940 and started to teach Hittitology within Ankara University's Faculty of Languages, History and Geography (DTCF). He became the dean of the faculty in 1959, continuing at the same time his work in the field. One of his most notable discoveries was the mound of Ma≈üat H√∂y√ºk, which in the quantities of Hittite cuneiform tablets was second only to the Hittite capital at Hattusas modern Boƒüazkale, near √áorum. Outside Turkey, Prof. Alp was awarded the Italian Commandatore of the Order of Merit of the Republic in 1957, the Order of Merit of the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1972, the French College of France medal in 1980, the German Great Cross of Merit with star and the Grande Ufficiale Order of Merit of the Italian Presidency of the Republic in 1991. From 1997 he held an honorary doctorate at the University of W√ºrzburg, and from the following year was made a member of the British Academy and, for the contributions he made to the promotion of knowledge on the region's historical treasures, an honorary citizen of the city of √áorum in north-central Anatolia, where the Hittite capital was situated. He died in Ankara.

Design and development In December 1946 an agreement was signed between Westland Aircraft and Sikorsky to allow a British version of the S-51 to be manufactured under licence in the United Kingdom. These would be powered by the 500 hp Alvis Leonides radial engine. A modified version was also developed by Westland as the Westland Widgeon, but it was commercially unsuccessful. Operational history The Dragonfly entered service with the Royal Navy in 1950 in the air-sea rescue role. A number were also used by the Royal Air Force for casualty evacuation. It was replaced in British service by the Westland Whirlwind, another derivative of a Sikorsky design, in the late 1950s. Fifty-one civilian WS-51s were produced. Examples were used by Pest Control Ltd for crop spraying and others were flown as executive transports by Silver City Airways, Evening Standard Newspapers and Fairey Aviation.

Dionysios Philosophos (ŒîŒπŒøŒΩœçœÉŒπŒøœÇ Œø Œ¶ŒπŒªœåœÉŒøœÜŒøœÇ, Dionysios the Philosopher) or Skylosophos (; c. 1560‚Äì1611), \\"the Dog-Philosopher\\" or \\"Dogwise\\", (\\"skylosophist\\"), as called by his rivals, was a Greek Orthodox bishop who led two farmer revolts against the Ottoman Empire, in Thessaly (1600) and Ioannina (1611), with Spanish aid. Early life Dionysius was born in 1541, in Aydonat, Sesprotya, Ottoman Empire (modern Paramythia, Thesprotia, Greece). He was of Greek descent, from Macedonia (specifically Avdella, Grevena regional unit) with Epirotian parentage. At a very young age, Dionysius became a kaloyeros at Dichouni. At age 15, he went to Padua where he studied medicine, philosophy, philology, logic, astronomy, and poetry. He took the name \\"Philosophos\\" (philosopher). In 1582, he lived in Constantinople and in 1592 he was elected metropolitan bishop of Larissa and Trikke.Ta Nea; Vrellis. The Holy Metropolis of Larissa and Tirnavos The Holy Metropolis of Larissa and Tirnavos. Due to his astrology, fortune-telling activities and contacts with demons he was deposed by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Rebellions Dionysius led a farmer revolt in 1600 in the region of Agrafa. He was demoted from the rank of metropolitan bishop of Larissa for his public speeches inciting rebellion and for his related fundraising activities. He subsequently left for the Republic of Venice where he raised enough funds to pay for a peasant army and tried to get contact with the Pope. After returning to Greece, he made his headquarters in the Monastery of St. Demetrius in Dichouni () of Thesprotia. As a monk, he toured the surrounding villages, raising an army of about 700 men. Armed with simple weapons, his army succeeded in several surprise attacks against small Ottoman garrisons of the area. Encouraged by these successes, he led his army into Ioannina on 11 September 1611. The inhabitants of the city were so surprised by the sight of the armed men and the fires that they turned against each other in confusion, unaware of the purpose of the fighting. This second revolt by Dionysius in 1611 in Ioannina ended in failure as the Ottoman garrison under Aslan Pasha eventually prevailed.Ta Nea; Vrellis. Death Dionysius hid in a cave by the lake but was captured. When he was presented to Osman Pasha his famous words were: \\"I fought in order to free the people from your tortures and your tyranny\\". Dionysius was tortured and perished upon being flayed alive by the Turks in September 1611. His skin was filled with hay and was paraded around the city, rebuked as the \\"skylosophos\\" - rather than \\"philosophos\\" (skylos meaning \\"dog\\").Ta Nea; Vrellis. The term was possibly coined by one of his main opponents, Maximus the Peloponnesian, another monk, loyal to the Patriarchate and the Ottoman Empire. The Greek population was removed from those houses inside the castle of Ioannina and lost their privileges. The old church of Saint John the Baptist, guardian of the city, dating to the period of Justinian, was destroyed and its monks were killed. The Aslan Pasha Mosque was erected in its place in 1618 to commemorate the success of Aslan Pasha in quelling the rebellion.Ta Nea; Vrellis.

The bridge is a part of Canning Highway, and it connects the suburbs of Como and Applecross. The Canning River is approximately 100 metres (328 ft) wide at the crossing,Width estimated from 47th edition (2005) UBD, Map 308. the narrowest point of the river along its downstream stretch.www.southperth.wa.gov.au A Brief History of the City of South Perth. Access 22 March 2006. It is located near the Canning Bridge railway station.  History  There have been four different structures at the present site.  First bridge: 1849  The first bridge was designed in 1846 by Henry Trigg, then Superintendent of Public Works. The bridge as designed was 520 feet (175 m) long and 12 feet (4 m) wide. It had a central span of 24 feet (8 m), and its deck sat just 8 feet (2 m) above the river water. Construction on the bridge was not commenced until 1849 because the original tenders were too costly. The bridge was built by Solomon Cook, costing ¬£425. The bridge served as a vital traffic link between Fremantle, Perth and Guildford.  Second bridge: 1867  The Silver Star river steamer ferry at Coffee Point, Applecross with the second (1867) Canning Bridge in the background, Flooding in the Swan and Canning Rivers in 1862 damaged the Canning and Helena Bridges, as well as The Causeway. As a result, a new Canning Bridge was built in 1867 by convicts. This second bridge had a clearance of 12 feet (4 m) above the river water; the bridge deck was raised to have a clearance of 18 feet (6 m) in 1892.  Third bridge: 1908  Due to poor maintenance, the second bridge slowly deteriorated. A fire damaged the structure, and since the road served as a critical traffic link, funding was provided for a new bridge in 1907 and 1908. The new bridge was built in 1908 at a cost of ¬£2,023, and was a sturdier construction. It was located south east of the present bridge. During the Great Depression, between 1930 and 1933, bushland on the eastern bank of the Canning River at Canning Bridge hosted many homeless families in bushland camps.  Current structure: 1939  The current bridge and Raffles Hotel, shortly after their construction in 1939 Canning Highway, looking towards Canning Bridge and the apartment block built on the site of the Raffles Hotel. Construction on a replacement for the third bridge began in 1938. The new bridge, which cost ¬£24,830, was opened in December 1939. It was a timber pile-driven bridge constructed of jarrah, karri and wandoo timber, and features three navigation spans, two of 24 metres and one of 18 metres. It is 175 metres long. Due to the outbreak of World War II, the third bridge was not immediately demolished, in case of damage to the new bridge by enemy attack. The third bridge was kept in place until the late 1940s. The 1939 bridge remains standing today, however it has been extensively modified since it was first opened and only carries Eastbound traffic on Canning Highway. In 1958, another pile-driven timber bridge was constructed alongside the existing 1939 bridge on its upstream (Southern) side, effectively doubling the traffic capacity of the structure. This newer structure featured a fishing platform below, but in most other respects was very similar to the original carriageway. 1958 saw the shortening of the 1939 (downstream) bridge on its Eastern end by 3 spans to accommodate an on-ramp to the then-new Kwinana Freeway. Then, between 1965 and 1966, both the downstream and upstream bridges were widened on their outer sides by an extra 2 piles, to give a total of 8 piles per pier on each bridge. At this time, the fishing platform underneath the 1958 (upstream) bridge was also extended and modified. 1976 saw the installation of a reinforced concrete overlay onto the 1939 (downstream) bridge's deck, and the same was performed on the 1958 (upstream) bridge in 1984. The original karri timber halfcaps in the 1939 bridge's structure were replaced by steel in 1994-1995 due to termite damage. Other substructure repairs were also carried out at this time, and the Eastern abutment of the 1958 bridge was reinforced with concrete. In 1997, the reinforced concrete overlay on the bridge decks was replaced, and was expected to help lengthen the lifespan of the structure by 40 years. Further reinforced concrete was used in 1998-1999 to stop further damage to the bridge's superstructure.  Raffles Hotel  Raffles Hotel The location of Canning Bridge on the road from Fremantle to Perth and Guildford made it a suitable location for accommodation and refreshments. As a result, in 1896 the Canning Bridge Hotel was built near the bridge on its western (Applecross) side. This building was extensively upgraded in 1939 with a distinctive art-deco facade designed by architect William G. Bennett to coincide with the construction of the current bridge. The building was renamed the Raffles Hotel after the hotel of the same name in Singapore. Apart from its status as \\"the epitome\\" of Perth's social scene in the 1940s and 1950s, the Raffles later became noted for its animated neon billboards advertising beer. During the 1970s and 1980s the Raffles was notable for its live music attracting the most popular local and interstate acts. In 2002, the site was sold to construction company Multiplex, which proceeded to redevelop the site into a 17-storey apartment tower. As part of the planning permissions, the art-deco 1939 building was retained and renovated. Heritage status In March 2012 the bridge attained status on the Western Australian State Heritage list.

Banks. The series centers around a young \\"twenty-something\\" woman named Damali Richards who is a spoken word artist but is also the Neteru, a human who is born once every thousand years to fight the Dark Realms. Her most dangerous and most constant enemy from The Dark Realms are vampires. The entire series is based on the never ending struggle between good and evil. The Vampire Huntress Legend Series is also about the strong bonds of love. Love that exists in the form of family love, friendship love, love of self, love for the world (environment) and the love between man and woman. There is also intense subject matter on religion within this series. The cover art for this series was done by Vince Natale, while inside illustrations are the work of Eric Battle. Books 1 and 2 of The Vampire Huntress Legend Series (Minion and The Awakening), have been optioned for Hollywood films by Moontide Pictures, LLC. Originally a nine book series with St. Martin's Press/Griffin, has now become a twelve book series. Minion The first book in the series, Minion, introduces Damali - a young twenty-year- old African American woman who is Neteru (the huntress). Damali is a very influential spoken word artist who writes and produces all her material (a lot of which is based on her own life experiences). Damali was orphaned at an early age and her experiences in foster care led her to escape, starting her journey as a vampire huntress. Damali's guardian team is introduced, consisting of Marlene, Nafes Shabazz, Big Mike, Jose, JL and Rider. Every member of the group possesses some sort of paranormal abilities. Damali's team encounter an unusual breed of vampires, who differ from the \\"regular\\" ones in appearance and exude an odor so strong that it makes some of the team members physically sick. The protagonists eventually find out that these creatures are hybrids created by the evil vampire Fallon Nuit, who refers to them as \\"minions\\". Carlos Rivera is a young Hispanic drug lord seeking vengeance for his murdered friends and family, unaware that he is being led into a trap by none other than Fallon Nuit who sees plenty of potential evil and wants him to join his cause as a vampire. In order to save himself, Damali and the guardian team, Carlos forms an alliance with second highest council of the dark side. The Awakening (2) Synoposis: Carlos Rivera is on the hunt for the Neteru, and is stronger than Damali's Guardians ever imagined. Prayer lines notwithstanding, he's coming for his woman. This thing between them goes way back; it was there even before he'd turned. As a vampire and a man, he has a lot of decisions to make, a lot of factions after him, but there's one thing that's always been clear‚Äîhe wants her. The Hunted (3) Synopsis: Carlos Rivera has descended another level, drawing more power from the dark side. The battle in Hell was nothing compared to the ongoing battle he's fought against his desire for The Neteru. And this fantastically frustrating woman is going after the were-demon realms, too? Not on his watch. He's more than a Master Vampire, he's Council Level now... and still, for all his power, there's one objective that has consistently eluded him‚ÄîDamali Richards. But not tonight. The Bitten (4) Synopsis: Yeah... she knew what they‚Äôd said about not messing with this man, this temptation... but some things had to be learned by experience. For Damali, this brother was the one thing that had always slayed her, Isis blade notwithstanding. She'd gone to his lair to get turned out, not turned... which was a totally different thing altogether. Only problem is, there is nothing in Marlene's big black book about how to cure this. An Encounter of the Forbidden Kind The Forbidden (5) The Body of a Goddess...with the Heart of Hell itself. The devil is a dead-beat dad and his consort Lilith couldn't care less. A stolen embryo stirs in Lilith's womb and a plan pulses through her veins: To unleash her child from the gates of hell‚Äîas soon as she destroys the only two vampire hunters who can possibly stop her... Damali Richards is a woman-child in a world running with blood, depravity and demons. Turned by her lover, Carlos Rivera, and brought back again, Damali clings to the one measure of purity that was handed down to her through generations of the wise, gifted and strong. Now, through the power of magic, through the ache of desire and the touch of her lover, Damali is on a journey from the streets of Philadelphia to the ancient earth of Africa. With a small army, with Carlos and with her own mad skills, she might just save the world from the demon seductress who wants her and her faith obliterated‚Äîbefore Armageddon begins...

Young Adult Series Shadow Walker: A Neteru Academy Novel Sixteen years prior to the end of days, two Neterus, along with a Neteru Guardian team, known as The Warriors of Light, fought shoulder to shoulder with Guardian teams around the world. Although they vanquished the Ultimate Evil it still came back with insidious vengeance, taking over all the war-ravaged countries slowly but surely. Those who fought against it were hunted, but those brave men and women of the resistance kept the faith and honed their skills, always at the ready to save humanity from demonic forces. Children of these brave warriors will one day take their parents places in the ongoing struggle. But until that time, they must become adept at using the special talents they were born with and must be kept out of harm's way while their parents continue to fight for justice. Hence the Neteru Academy (a.k.a. Temt Tchaas Academy - meaning sacred texts) was born. Secreted away in the Appalachian Mountains, this magic-glamoured pyramid that was relocated from the Mayan ruins as well as the capstone taken from Egypt during the big war, hides the entrance to a forgotten bunker left over from the old 1950s cold war between the United States and Russia. Originally built by President Dwight Eisenhower, the actual school is underground and is housed in what was to then be a fall-out shelter for the executive branches of the American government in the event of a nuclear catastrophe. But it never came to that. The big war everyone feared was not between rival nations, but rival worlds. The conflict between the Light and the darkness unleashed plagues, and vampires, werewolves, zombies, and all manner of demons. It created refugees amongst both the human and supernatural populations. Some individuals were given a chance to choose sides based upon their service to humankind. Others were already too far gone. Some angels wept; some turned dark. It was a time of complete chaos and anarchy was the order of the day. Initially, only the Guardians and the Neterus saw what was happening and became the small, rag-tag line of defense against a growing, slithering evil. These brave warriors frustrated the dark side at every turn and still battle on in the new millennium. Now, with time being short until the Ultimate Evil returns, the children of the Guardian resistance must quickly hone all their special talents and learn expert battle skills - skills that their parents had years to perfect. Time is not on their side, but one can only hope that the Light will make the critical difference.

K√ºhl had taken part in the 1960 and 1964 unified German team at the Summer Olympic games. In 1973 Beyer changed clubs as well as coaches moving to ASK Vorw√§rts Potsdam under Lothar Hillebrand. In Potsdam he concentrated solely on the shot put and began also studying at the University to become a physical education teacher. As a member of the Army sports club (ASK) Beyer was also a sports officer of the NVA and had also become Hauptmann (Captain) in the Bundeswehr. His sport career was essentially over after the 1988 Summer Olympic games, but his wife was able to convince him in 1990 to continue until 1992. For many years, Beyer was captain of the East German athletics national team. At a height of 1.94 meters, he weighed 130 kilograms. Even for a shot putter, Beyer was exceptionally strong. At the end of his sport career, Beyer started work as a travel agent and has owned a travel agency in Potsdam since 1996. He lives in Potsdam and has been married since 1976 and has had two daughters, one of whom died as a child. All of his siblings were very active in sports. At the Summer Olympics of 1980 in Moscow, Udo was with his sister Gisela Beyer and his brother Hans-Georg Beyer. All three reached their respective final rounds: Hans-Georg was Olympic champion with his handball team, Udo was third in the shot put and Gisela was fourth in the discus. His sister Gudrun was also with him at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, as a physical therapist. Since 2004 Beyer is also the \\"Chocolate Ambassador\\" for Germany's oldest chocolate factory, Halloren of Halle (Saale). He is also very active as an official representative for the \\"children's hospice of middle Germany\\" for terminally ill children and their families. Beyer has admitted to knowingly taking part in doping while he competed for East Germany ‚Äì which had a systematic doping program for its top athletes in the 1970s. His admission came in the documentary film The Lone Wolf, which was first shown in the 2013 Berlin Film Festival.Former Olympic Shot Put Champion, Udo Beyer, Admits to Doping ; 14 February 2013 news item in Sports Illustrated SI.com; accessed 20 March 2013.

Biography Nikolay Adlerberg was born into a Swedish noble family of Adlerberg on 19 May 1819 in Saint Petersburg. His father, Vladimir Fyodorovich Adlerberg was a close friend of Nicholas I; in 1852-1870 he was President of the Russian Imperial Post Department, who introduced the first Russian post stamps. Nikolay Adlerberg graduated from the Page Corps of His Majesty in 1837, and in 1838 appointed aide-de-camp to the Emperor; participated in wars led by Russia in Caucasus (1841‚Äì1842) and Hungary in 1849. After the Hungarian campaign he was promoted to the rank of colonel and awarded with golden weapons. Adlerberg resigned in 1852 and was attached to the Russian Ministry of the Interior, receiving the title of the chamberlain in the court of His Majesty the same. On 10 June 1853 Adlerberg was appointed Governor of Taganrog, but he left the Governor's office into the hands of general Yegor Tolstoy in spring 1854 due to declared state of war in Taganrog and proximity of Crimean War actions. In 1855, Nikolay Adlerberg was promoted to the rank of mayor-general and married Amalie Gr√§fin of Lerchenfeld (1808‚Äì1888) (in the first marriage Baroness Amalie von Kr√ºdener). Count Adlerberg served as governor-general of Simferopol and Taurida Governorate (1854‚Äì1856) during uneasy period of the Crimean War. Later he served at the Imperial Russian Diplomatic Mission in Berlin in 1856-1866. Nikolay Adlerberg was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1861 and infantry-general in 1870, and during sixteen years served as Governor-General of Finland (1866‚Äì1881). Being a theater enthusiast, he established the Russian Theater in Helsingfors in 1868, which was named Alexandre Theater in 1879 after Alexander II of Russia. On 22 May 1881 the Count was named member of the State Council, but was pensioned off from this post after assassination of his protector, Emperor Alexander II of Russia. Nikolay and Amalie Adlerberg moved to Germany, where they settled at Maximilian Lerchenfeld's estate in Tegernsee near Munich. Nikolay Adlerberg died on 25 December 1892 in Munich, Bavaria.

Jack informs his wife that, after thirty years of marriage, he intends to leave. Gillian does not react as he would expect; therefore he enters three times more. Gillian's answers make him angry. Finally Jack collapses on a chair. After expressing his frustration and insecurity, he learns that Gillian keeps critical notes on their lovemaking; he becomes even more paralyzed. Gillian and Jack, like George and Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, play ritual games to express and contain their sense of life-disappointment. In the middle of the play, the couple starts fighting with each other, clawing, punching and biting, even after they fall on the floor. Exhausted by the fighting, they start to talk about the memorable times in their life. However, Gillian is determined to return to the previous insults and tells Jack he is not the only one who was unfaithful to his partner. Critical response The reviewer for the Phoenix New Times wrote of a 2008 production directed by Kathleen Butler (the original Gillian): \\"'Marriage Play' is essentially a far less sophisticated update on Albee's George and Martha, the historically high-strung hotheads of his 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Like George and Martha, Jack and Gillian... are disappointed in their post- middle-age lives. Also like George and Martha, they don't speak to one another; they bellow. They don't communicate; they play-act, staging and restaging the same scene (in which Jack attempts to abandon his wife) until they (and we) are happily exhausted... Butler's directorial stamp is all over this, and her deep knowledge of Albee's work allows us to hear clearly his peculiar rhythms, to see how he ‚Äî and the people in this marriage play ‚Äî envisions life as an act in an often-dreary theatrical story.\\"Pela, Robert L. \\"'Marriage Play' Spices Up A Worn-Oot Relationship With Battle Sequences And Admissions Of Infidelity\\" Phoenix New Times , October 23, 2008 References Category:Plays by Edward Albee Category:Adultery in plays Category:1986 plays ","title":"Marriage Play"},{"id":"4477218","text":"A wooden tankard found on board the 16th century carrack Mary Rose. A tankard is a form of drinkware consisting of a large, roughly cylindrical, drinking cup with a single handle. Tankards are usually made of silver or pewter, but can be made of other materials, for example wood, ceramic or leather. A tankard may have a hinged lid, and tankards featuring glass bottoms are also fairly common. Tankards are shaped and used similarly to beer steins. Wooden tankards The word \\"tankard\\" originally meant any wooden vessel (13th century) and later came to mean a drinking vessel. The earliest tankards were made of wooden staves, similar to a barrel, and did not have lids. A 2000-year-old wooden tankard of approximately four-pint capacity has been unearthed in Wales.Tankard BlogLangstone tankard Glass bottoms Metal tankards often come with a glass bottom. The legend is that the glass bottomed tankard was developed as a way of refusing the King's shilling, i.e. conscription into the British army or navy. The drinker could see the coin in the bottom of the glass and refuse the drink, thereby avoiding conscription. However, this is likely to be a myth, since the Navy could press by force, rendering deception unnecessary. In a bar fight, the first punch was thrown while the recipient had the tankard raised to his mouth; another legend has it that the glass bottom was implemented so as to see the attack coming. A further story is that the glass bottom merely allowed the drinker to judge the clarity of their drink while forgoing the expense of a fragile pint glass. Glass bottoms are sometimes retrofitted to antique tankards, reducing their value and authenticity. Conversions Covered tankards fell out of fashion in 19th century England resulting in a number of them being converted to other roles such as jugs. Modern tankards Metal and ceramic tankards are still manufactured, but are regarded as speciality or novelty items. Modern metal tankards are often engraved to commemorate some occasion. Glass tankards--that is, straight-sided or inward-sloping glass vessels with strap handles--are still in everyday use. Lead leaching from pewter In previous centuries, the pewter used to make tankards often contained lead, which exposed the drinker to medical effects, ranging from heavy metal poisoning to gout. This effect was exacerbated in cider-drinking areas‚Äîsuch as Somerset, UK‚Äîas the acidity of the cider leached the lead from the pewter more quickly. Clay tankards became prevalent in this area. Pewter is now widely lead-free.

Musical career Kirchner enjoyed the friendship and admiration of many leading composers of the 19th century yet was unable to maintain a successful career, apparently due to a disordered way of life which included extravagant spending and an addiction to gambling. He was born at Neukirchen near Chemnitz and at the age of eight was already an accomplished organist and pianist. From 1838 to 1842, he studied in Leipzig under J. Knorr (piano) and K. F. Becker (organ and theory). Kirchner subsequently was a pupil of J. Schneider in Dresden and attended the Leipzig Conservatory for a short time. In 1843, he became organist in Winterthur, Switzerland on the recommendation of Mendelssohn. He remained there for nearly 20 years, but travelled much in Germany, befriending Robert and Clara Schumann and Brahms. Clara Schumann was very fond of him, though she wrote that 'in his character there is no stability', and it appears they had a discreet affair in the early 1860s. In 1862, Kirchner moved to Zurich as the director of the subscription concerts there. This only lasted three years. From 1862 to 1872, Kirchner taught in the music school at Zurich. He was married in 1868, but the marriage was not a success. After a spell from 1870 as organist in Zurich, he moved to Meiningen in 1872 to become court pianist; he was made director of the Conservatory in W√ºrzburg the next year, serving until 1875. From 1876‚Äì1883, he lived in Leipzig, then taught score-reading in Dresden until 1890. In 1884, Brahms, Hanslick, Gade, Grieg and Hans von B√ºlow raised 30,000 marks to enable Kirchner to pay off his debts. In 1890, he abandoned his wife and family and moved to Hamburg, where he was looked after by a former pupil. Two strokes left him paralysed in 1894, and he became completely blind in his last years. He died in Hamburg, on 18 September 1903. Kirchner was esteemed by, amongst others, Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann (who wrote approvingly of him in Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik), Brahms, Liszt, Wagner, Dvo≈ô√°k, and Grieg. Compositions and arrangements He was a gifted arranger whose transcriptions include the realization of Brahms's two string sextets as piano trios; he also made the vocal score of Brahms's German Requiem and solo piano arrangements of the third and fourth sets of Hungarian Dances and the Liebeslieder Walzer. As a composer, he was an intense romantic lyricist and a natural miniaturist ‚Äî he is credited with having written over 1000 piano pieces (mainly collected in cycles) of which many are only a minute or so in duration ‚Äî a kind of 19th-century forerunner of Webern's Bagatelles. His waltzes, opus 23, composed in 1876, are dedicated to Brahms and the suite of 'characteristic pieces', Nachtbilder, opus 25 quotes Brahms's song Wie bist du, meine K√∂nigin. There are also some organ pieces and songs and a few choral and chamber works, but no orchestral music at all, though his friend Heinrich Sch√ºlz-Beuthen made an orchestral suite out of some of Kirchner's piano pieces. He was especially influenced by Robert Schumann's music. Kirchner's complete works are being published by Amadeus in Winterthur.

G. Wodehouse, which first appeared in the United Kingdom in the June 1926 Strand Magazine, and in the United States in the 5 June 1926 issue of Liberty. Part of the Blandings Castle canon, it features the absent-minded peer Lord Emsworth, and was included in the collection Blandings Castle and Elsewhere (1935), although the story takes place sometime between the events of Leave it to Psmith (1923) and Summer Lightning (1929).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 68‚Äì69, A53. Plot Beach, long-serving butler at Blandings, is considering handing in his notice after 18 years, unable to bear the shame of his master Lord Emsworth's rather disreputable new beard. His Lordship himself, unaware of these ructions below stairs, is worried by a telegram from his younger son Freddie, who is back in London from America. Visiting Freddie, Emsworth learns that the boy has fallen out with his wife Aggie; having written a scenario for Hollywood to impress her, he tried to persuade a prominent starlet to promote it for him; however, he is seen dining with the girl by Jane Yorke, a friend of his wife. Yorke tells Aggie she has seen Freddie with another girl, and she promptly leaves him. Freddie tries to persuade his father to plead with her on his behalf, convinced by his movie knowledge that an appeal from a white-haired old father never fails, but Emsworth refuses. Later, however, realising the danger of Freddie returning to Blandings if his marriage is not patched up, he relents, and pays a call at the lady's hotel. Finding the door to her room open, he potters vaguely in, and is chased into the bedroom by a small yapping dog, only to find she is in the bath. Her friend Jane Yorke holds him up with a gun, believing him to be a burglar, and while he is trying to explain himself, and Freddie, Freddie himself enters disguised as an old man with a white beard. Seeing a cable from Hollywood accepting his scenario, Aggie believes Freddie's story and forgives him, to Jane's disgust. Jane is ejected, and Emsworth, on hearing that he looks like Freddie in his false beard, decides to shave off his own, much to Beach's relief. Publication history \\"Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best\\" was published in the Strand in June 1926, with illustrations by Reginald Cleaver.McIlvaine (1990), p. 185, D133.126. It was published in Liberty on 5 June 1926, with illustrations by Wallace Morgan.McIlvaine (1990), p. 150, D36.6. On 29 May 1935, the story was published in the Family Herald and Weekly Star (Montreal, Canada), illustrated by James H. Hammon.McIlvaine (1990), p. 189, D146.7. The story lends its title to a complete collection of Wodehouse's Blandings shorts, published by Penguin in 1992, with an introduction by Frank Muir (part of the Penguin Twentieth Century Classics series). Adaptations In December 1940, a radio drama based on the story aired on the BBC Home Service. Adapted and produced by John Cheatle, it featured Frederick Lloyd as Lord Emsworth, Ralph Truman as Beach, Dora Gregory as the housekeeper Mrs Twemlow, Carleton Hobbs as Frederick Threepwood, Lydia Sherwood as Mrs Threepwood, and Betty Hardy as Jane Yorke. The story was adapted for television as the fourth episode of the first series of The World of Wodehouse in 1967. In 1985, the story was adapted for radio as part of the Blandings radio series. The episode was titled \\"Lord Emsworth Grows a Beard\\". The story was adapted into the fourth episode of the second series of the Blandings television series, also titled \\"Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best\\", which aired in March 2014.

The water infiltrates into the ground recharging the local groundwater, because the water table is below the bottom of the stream channel. This is the opposite of a more common gaining stream (or effluent stream) which increases in water volume farther down stream as it gains water from the local aquifer. Losing streams are common in arid areas due to the climate which results in huge amounts of water evaporating from the river generally towards the mouth.Ask GeoMan... Losing streams are also common in regions of karst topography where the streamwater may be completely captured by a cavern system, becoming a subterranean river.

Born in Exeter, Devon, England in 1958, he graduated with a degree in Fine Art from University of Reading in 1980 and then went to America to train as a photographer's assistant. From 1982 he moved to London working first as a freelance assistant before starting out as a general purpose commercial photographer. In 1986 his early travel and landscape photography was accepted into Charlie Waite's photolibrary, Landscape Only. From 1986 to 1995 Cornish was responsible for either all or the majority of the photography in more than thirty travel books. His first job for the National Trust was the 1990 book In Search of Neptune and he has worked freelance on assignments for them ever since. Since 1993 Cornish has lived and worked close to the North York Moors and has photographed the North Yorkshire landscape for over 20 years, while still continuing to photograph around the British Isles and overseas. He co-owns the Joe Cornish Gallery in Northallerton North Yorkshire from where he displays a permanent collection of his prints and hosts photographic and printing workshops throughout the year. In 2006 Amateur Photographer honoured him with their annual Power of Photography award, and in 2008 he was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. Cornish has been involved in the Distinction panels of the RPS, the judging team of Wildlife Photographer of the Year, and as host of the Natural History Museum's annual Understanding Photography events. He frequently lectures throughout the UK and abroad and his written work often appears in the online photography magazine On Landscape (of which he is a co- founder).

Overview Security culture recognizes the possibility that anarchist spaces and movements are surveilled and/or infiltrated by informants or undercover operatives. Security culture has three components: determining when and how surveillance is occurring, protecting anarchist communities if infiltration occurs, and responding to security breaches. Its origins are uncertain, though some anarchists identify its genesis in the new social movements of the 1960s, which were targeted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's COINTELPRO projects. The sociologist Christine M. Robinson has identified security culture as a response to the labelling of anarchists as terrorists in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The geographer Nathan L. Clough describes security culture as \\"a technique for cultivating a new affective structure\\". The political scientist Sean Parson offers the following definition: \\"'security culture' ... includes such rules as not disclosing full names, one's activist history, or anything else that could be used to identify oneself or others to authorities. The goal of security culture is to weaken the influence of infiltrators and 'snitches,' which allows groups to more readily engage in illegal acts with less concern for arrest.\\" Security culture does not involve abandoning confrontational political tactics, but rather eschews boasting about such deeds on the basis that doing so facilitates the targeting and conviction of anarchist activists. Advocates of security culture aim to make its practices instinctive, automatic or unconscious. Participants in anarchist movements see security culture as vital to their ability to function, especially in the context of the War on Terror. Features Christine Robinson identifies the black bloc tactic as a component of security culture. Security culture regulates what topics can be discussed, in what context, and among whom. It prohibits speaking to law enforcement, and certain media and locations are identified as security risks; the Internet, telephone and mail, individuals' homes and vehicles, and community meeting places are assumed to contain covert listening devices. Security culture prohibits or discourages discussing involvement in illegal or covert activities. Three exceptions, however, are drawn: discussing plans with others involved, discussing criminal activities for which one has been convicted, and discussing past actions anonymously in zines or with trusted media are permitted. Robinson identifies the black bloc tactic, in which anarchists cover their faces and wear black clothing, as a component of security culture. Other practices include the use of pseudonyms and \\"[i]nverting the gaze to inspect others' corporeality\\". Breaches of security culture may be met by avoiding, isolating or shunning those responsible. 2008 Republican National Convention In his discussion of security culture during the protests around the 2008 Republican National Convention (RNC), Clough notes that \\"fear of surveillance and infiltration\\" impeded trust among activists and led to energy being directed toward counter-measures. He also suggests that security culture practices may cause newer participants in movements to feel less welcome or less trusted, and therefore less likely to commit to causes, and, in the context of the 2008 RNC, prevented those who did not conform to anarchist norms from assuming prominent positions within the RNC Welcoming Committee. Assessing the role of security culture in the anti-RNC mobilisation, which was infiltrated by four police operatives, Clough finds that had \\"a mixed record\\", succeeding in frustrating shorter-term infiltrators operating at the movement's peripheries, but failing to prevent longer-term infiltrators from gaining others' trust.

G. Wodehouse, which first appeared in the United States in the 9 July 1927 issue of Liberty, and in the United Kingdom in the August 1927 Strand. Part of the Blandings Castle canon, it features the absent-minded peer Lord Emsworth, and was included in the collection Blandings Castle and Elsewhere (1935), although the story takes place sometime between the events of Leave it to Psmith (1923) and Summer Lightning (1929).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 68‚Äì69, A53. Plot summary Lord Emsworth, keen that his fat pig, the Empress of Blandings, should win the 87th annual Shropshire Agricultural Show, is distraught when his pigman, Wellbeloved, is sent to prison for fourteen days for being drunk and disorderly in a Market Blandings inn. The pig immediately goes off her feed, and with the vet baffled, Emsworth is in no state to listen to his sister Connie's bleatings about his niece Angela breaking off her engagement from Lord Heacham in favour of the quite unsuitable James Belford, who Emsworth himself always liked, being a friend of the lad's father, a local parson. Emsworth, still distracted about his pig, is sent to London to have stern words with Belford; dining with him at the Senior Conservative Club, conversation turns to pigs, and Belford, having spent two years on a Nebraska farm, proceeds to impress Emsworth with his knowledge of pig-calls of all states. He teaches Emsworth the master call, the \\"pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey\\" to which all pigs will respond, and Emsworth heads home happily. Falling asleep on the train, Emsworth forgets the call, but while talking to Angela in the castle grounds, is reminded of it by the sound of Mrs Twemlow's gramophone. He, Beach and Angela all try the call on the Empress, but to no avail; just when all looks black, Belford arrives, shows them how the call should really sound, and to everyone's delight the Empress tucks heartily into her food. She goes on, of course, to win the contest.

In Europe, with Chamaerops humilis (palm tree that grows in the Mediterranean) are the unique native palm trees in continental Europe. In Turkey, it is the only native palm species; all the others‚Äîalthough much more common‚Äîwere introduced. The specific epithet theophrasti was chosen by the Swiss botanist Werner Greuter in 1967 for the fact that Theophrastus, the ancient Greek \\"father of botany\\", had described several types of palms, including one from Crete. A genomic study from New York University Abu Dhabi Center for Genomics and Systems Biology showed that domesticated date palm varieties from North Africa, including well-known varieties such as Medjool and Deglet Noor, are a hybrid between Middle East date palms and P. theophrasti. Description Apart from the usually inedible dates and upright fruit clusters, the Cretan species can appear quite similar to the cultivated date (Phoenix dactylifera). Phoenix theophrasti grows up to 15 m tall, usually with several slender stems. The leaves are pinnate, 2‚Äì3 m long, with numerous rigid greyish-green linear leaflets 15‚Äì50 cm long on each side of the central rachis. Dead leaves are marcescent, remaining attached to the stem for years after withering. The fruit is an oval yellowish-brown drupe 1.5 cm long and 1 cm diameter and containing a single large seed. The fruit pulp is too thin and fibrous to be of agricultural significance and has an acrid taste, though the fruits are sometimes eaten by the locals. Distribution Sites on Crete include Vai in the Lasithi Prefecture, Ayios Nikitas in Heraklion Prefecture, and Preveli gorge and Souda near Plakias, both on the south coasts of Crete in Rethymnon Prefecture. Trees are also found on Amorgos island, on Halki Island, and on the south coast of Anafi island. Recently, around 10 trees, the only natural stand on the mainland, were found in an ancient palm forest in the Epidaurus area in Peloponnese. It has been proposed that its range was much more widespread in ancient Greece, growing from Crete to Thebes and from the Peloponnese to Delos. Its presence in Turkey was not described scientifically until the 1980s. There are four stands in southwest Turkey, especially on the Dat√ßa and Bodrum Peninsulas in Muƒüla Province and in Kumluca-Kara√∂z in Finike Bay. The plants from a grove in the village of G√∂lk√∂y in northern Bodrum are considered by some as a subspecies, having a shorter stem (4‚Äì8 m) but longer fruit stalks (.6‚Äì2 m). Areas forested with Phoenix theophrasti, Phoenix canariensis and Chamaerops humilis constitute Europe's only palm forests. References and external links *Davis, P. H., ed. (1965-1985).

Early life Born in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire, Wales, he moved to Swansea until, aged 15, he went to live with his aunt in Liverpool, just as the Merseybeat scene exploded. Weathers had had a drum-kit as a child, so took up drumming again, playing in several local bands. Returning to Wales in 1964, his experience on the Mersey scene got him into several local bands, including The Vikings (1964) and The Brothers Grimm (1965).Man's Family Jungle Retrieved 10 October 2008 Eyes of Blue In 1966 Weathers joined a Neath band The Eyes of Blue, along with Phil Ryan (keyboards) and Gary Pickford-Hopkins (vocals) from The Smokestacks. The band turned professional, and won the 1966 Melody Maker Beat Contest. The prize was a one-year record contract, but they had to record songs chosen for them, rather than their own material and neither of their singles, \\"Heart Trouble\\" / \\"Up And Down\\" and \\"Supermarket Full of Cans\\" / \\"Don't Ask Me To Mend Your Broken Heart\\", sold well. The Eyes of Blue changed label from Decca to Mercury Records and recorded their first album Crossroads of Time in 1968. They then recorded an album Buzzy, as the backing band for American singer-songwriter Buzzy Linhart, before recording their second album In Fields of Ardath in 1969.The Tapestry of Delights, Vernon Joynson ‚Äì The band Strawberry Dust supported The Eyes, and impressed Weathers, who persuaded Lou Reizner to commission an album, which Weathers produced and wrote/co-wrote 6 songs. Women & Children First was released in 1970, but Reizner renamed the band Ancient Grease, without telling them, and credited himself as co- producer.Sleevenote to reissue of \\"Women And Children First\\" The Eyes of Blue's third album, Bluebell Wood, released under the pseudonym Big Sleep, was their last, as the band broke up shortly afterwards. Weathers briefly played with Strawberry Dust, until they also broke up, later reforming as Racing Cars. After this break up he played drums on the final appearance of the Swansea Soul band the John Smith Committee. In 1970 Weathers and Phil Ryan joined Pete Brown & Piblokto! playing on one single, \\"Flying Hero Sandwich\\" / \\"My Last Band\\", before Piblokto also disbanded. Weathers then joined an embryonic Wild Turkey with Glenn Cornick (ex-Jethro Tull), Gary Pickford- Hopkins (ex Eyes of Blue) and Graham Williams (ex Strawberry Dust), but Weathers and Williams left to join Graham Bond's Magick before Wild Turkey recorded any material. He appeared on Graham Bond's 1971 album, We Put Our Magick on You, and later that year joined The Grease Band. Gentle Giant (For details of Weathers' work in this period see Gentle Giant) Weathers joined Gentle Giant in 1972, as a temporary stand in for their drummer Malcolm Mortimore, who had been injured in a motorcycle accident. He first played on Gentle Giant's Octopus album, and his position soon became permanent, remaining with them until they broke up, after their last album Civilian (1980). He was well liked by fans for his distinctive hard-bashing drum style, and also played vibes and xylophone, among other percussion instruments. He also added his vocals in both studio and live performances more and more frequently as time went on, even singing lead on the songs \\"Interview\\" and \\"Friends\\", the latter of which he also composed. Whilst with Gentle Giant, Weathers occasionally played with Phil Ryan's band The Neutrons, including their 1974 album, Black Hole Star. Man and Recent years After Gentle Giant disbanded in 1980, Weathers played a number of temporary positions, until he joined the psychedelic/progressive rock band Man when they reformed in 1983. Apart from a short spell, when he was unwell and Rick Martinez temporarily took over, he stayed with Man until 1996, recording 2 studio albums and 3 live albums, and becoming their longest serving drummer, allegedly leaving because Gentle Giant were planning to reform. He left Man shortly before Phil Ryan re- joined the band. Weathers was featured in the 1986 S4C TV programme Rocking with a Sikh, backing the Sikh Elvis impersonator Peter Singh, along with Martin Ace and Micky Jones. Weathers was variously reported to have been suffering from RSI or arthritis, but according to him was actually \\"diagnosed with a condition called Spinocerebellar ataxia, which is akin to M.S\\".. The unpublished memoirs of his time spent in Morriston Hospital ‚Äì Two Weeks in Pain ‚Äì Under the Knife, document the trials of an NHS in-patient in post-op recovery. Weathers has appeared on several Welsh TV soundtracks, and in 2006 rejoined Wild Turkey, to record their album You & Me in the Jungle and tour Europe. Weathers is also a keen ornithologist.

A collector of specimens and field naturalist of repute, he became a member of several expeditions to survey the fauna and flora. He was part of a team with Clinton Hart Merriam that took part in the Death Valley Expedition. He also explored the Yosemite Valley. A number of vertebrate species are named after him.  Biography  Nelson was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, on May 8, 1855, the first son of William and Martha () Nelson. Nelson and his brother then lived with his maternal grandparents in the Adirondacks when his father joined the Union Army and mother went to Baltimore as a nurse. Here he fell in love with the wilderness. Nelson moved to Chicago after his father was killed in the Civil War and his mother established a dressmaking business. In 1871, his large insect collection was lost in the Chicago Fire and the family was left homeless. This was the time that he moved focus from insects to birds. He went to Cook County Normal School from 1872 to 1875 where the principal, W. W. Wentworth encourage him. Nelson also met Henry Henshaw and Edward Drinker Cope who helped him develop his interests in birds. In 1877. Nelson joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Spencer Fullerton Baird was responsible for selecting Signal Officers for the remoter stations, and would choose men with scientific training who were prepared to study the local flora and fauna. Baird sent Nelson to St. Michael, Alaska. Nelson was the naturalist on board , which sailed to Wrangel Island in search of the Jeannette expedition in 1881. Nelson published his findings in the Report upon Natural History Collections Made in Alaska between the Years 1877‚Äì1881 (1887). He also published his ethnological findings in The Eskimo about Bering Strait (1900). Nelson in Alaska In 1890 Nelson accepted an appointment as a special field agent with the Death Valley Expedition under Clinton Hart Merriam, chief of the Division of Ornithology and Mammalogy, United States Department of Agriculture. After this expedition he was ordered to conduct a field survey in Mexico, and Nelson remained in the country for the next fourteen years. Nelson continued to work for the Bureau of Biological Survey until 1929, being chief of the bureau from 1916 to 1927. The desert bighorn sheep and Nelson's milksnake were named in his honor. The holotype of the milksnake was collected by Nelson and Edward Alphonso Goldman on July 18, 1897. He worked with Goldman for ten years surveying Mexican terrestrial vertebrates. Nelson's sparrow (Ammodramus nelsoni) (formerly Nelson's sharp- tailed sparrow; formerly sharp-tailed sparrow) was also named for him.

The Neognathae include virtually all living birds; exceptions being their sister taxon (Palaeognathae), which contains the tinamous and the flightless ratites. There are nearly 10,000 species of neognaths. The earliest fossils are known from the very end of the Cretaceous but molecular clocks suggest that neognaths originated sometime in the first half of the Late Cretaceous about 90 million year ago. Since then, they have undergone adaptive radiation producing the diversity of form, function, and behavior that we see today. It includes the order Passeriformes (perching birds), the largest clade of land vertebrates, containing some 60% of living birds and being more than twice as speciose as rodents and about five times as speciose as Chiroptera (bats), which are the largest clades of mammals. There are also some very small orders, usually birds of very unclear relationships like the puzzling hoatzin. The neognaths have fused metacarpals, an elongate third finger, and 13 or fewer vertebrae. They differ from the Palaeognathae in features like the structure of their jawbones. \\"Neognathae\\" means \\"new jaws\\", but it seems that the supposedly \\"more ancient\\" paleognath jaws are among the few apomorphic (more derived) features of the Palaeognaths, meaning that the respective jaw structure of these groups is not informative in terms of comparative evolution. Taxonomy and systematics The Neognathae were long ranked as a superorder subdivided into orders. Attempts to organise this group further, as in the Conspectus of Charles Lucien Bonaparte, were never accepted by a significant majority of ornithologists. Until the 1980s, there was little subdivision of the Aves in general, and even less of phylogenetic merit. Since then, the availability of massive amounts of new data from fossils (especially Enantiornithes and other Mesozoic birds) and molecular (DNA and protein) sequences allowed scientists to refine the classification. With new groups of neognath orders being verified, the taxonomic rank of the group needed to shift. Most researchers have now employed the unranked taxa of phylogenetic nomenclature.Mindell & Brown (2005) The Neognathae are now universally accepted to subdivide into two lineages, the \\"fowl\\" clade Galloanseres and the Neoaves (sometimes called \\"higher neognaths\\"). The subdivisions of the latter are still not well resolved, but several monophyletic lineages have been proposed, such as the Mirandornithes, Cypselomorphae, Metaves, and Coronaves. Although groups such as the former two (uniting a few closely related orders) are robustly supported, this cannot be said for the Metaves and Coronaves division for which there is no material evidence at present, while the Mesozoic record of Neognathae is at present utterly devoid of birds that should have been present if these proposed clades were real.For a draft phylogeny of Neoaves that is based on a review of massive amounts of published sources, and probably rather close to \\"the real thing\\", see Mindell et al. (2005) Systematics The orders are arranged in a sequence that attempts to follow the modern view on neognath phylogeny. It differs from the widely used Clements taxonomy as well as from the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, combining those elements from each that more modern research agrees with while updating those that are refuted. Most of the changes affect those \\"higher landbirds\\" that are sometimes united as near passerines.Mindell et al. (2005) Neognathia Feduccia defined the clade Neognathia as birds whose palatal mobility increased due to the following modifications (Feduccia 1980, 1996): * Loss of the Basipterygoid articulation with the cranium. * Development of a pterygoid/palatine joint. * Reduction of the vomer, such that it does not reach caudally to the pterygoid, or is lost entirely. Relationships Neognathae cladogram of modern bird relationships based on Prum, R.O. et al. (2015) with some clade names after Yuri, T. et al. (2013) and Kimball et al. 2013.

Background Jack was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, to parents who had migrated from Fife in 1930. The family returned to Scotland when he was seven, in 1952. He grew up in North Queensferry and was educated there and at Dunfermline High School. Career After a false start as a would-be librarian, he joined The Glasgow Herald as a trainee journalist in 1965 and after a short spell in its head office was sent to work on two weekly papers in Lanarkshire, the now-defunct Cambuslang Advertiser and the East Kilbride News. Later he worked for the Scottish Daily Express at its Glasgow offices. In 1970, he joined The Sunday Times in London, where he became a section editor and then a foreign correspondent-cum-feature writer with a special interest in South Asia and particularly India, which he began to visit in the mid 1970s. From 1986 to 1989, he wrote for The Observer and Vanity Fair, and then joined the team that created The Independent on Sunday, which he edited from 1991 to 1995. His editorship of the quarterly Granta magazine, to which he had previously contributed as a writer, spanned 47 issues over twelve years to 2007. While at Granta, Jack also commissioned and edited books by Diana Athill, Simon Gray, Janet Malcolm and Travis Elborough, among others. He has contributed regularly to The Guardian since 2001, and began to write a weekly column for the paper six years later. He occasionally teaches at the India Institute, King's College London. In 2009, Jack published a collection of essays and previously unpublished writings entitled The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain. One reviewer wrote of Jack's handling of time in this book: \\"He is up there with a fiction writer such as Alice Munro in his grasp of its ebb and flow, his awareness that its strong but rapidly changing currents often leave us wondering not only what we can remember, but what we should.\\" Alexander Chancellor called the book \\"superb\\", and added: \\"Collections of columns and newspaper articles are not usually a very good idea. They quickly become stale and dated, and one sometimes wonders what the point of them is except to deceive journalists into thinking that their ephemeral scribblings deserve some permanence. Jack is an exception to the rule.\\" The Economist wrote: \\"At the heart of the book are three magnificent essays, about the Hatfield train crash of 2000; the sinking of the Titanic and the film Titanic (1997); and the lost cinemas of Farnworth, Mr Jack's home town, which is also a circuitous epitaph for a lost brother. His contributions to 'this unequal struggle to preserve and remember' cumulatively transcend journalism and attain the status of literature.\\" Jack's awards include Journalist of the Year (Granada TV's What the Papers Say award, 1985), Reporter of the Year (British Press Awards, 1988) and Editor of the Year (Newspaper Industry Awards, 1993). He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Personal life He married Aparna Bagchi in 1979; the couple divorced in 1992. He lives in Highbury, London, with his second wife, Lindy Sharpe. They have two grown-up children and spend a part of every year on the Isle of Bute in the Firth of Clyde. Jack's mother was born in Kirkcaldy and brought up in Hill of Beath and his father was born in Dunfermline. His paternal grandfather was from Glasgow, his paternal grandmother born in India and they had lived in the now- demolished mining village of Lassodie, between Dunfermline and Kelty.

They emphasize deprescribing medications that are unnecessary, which helps to reduce the problems of polypharmacy, drug interactions, and adverse drug reactions, thereby improving the risk‚Äìbenefit ratio of medication regimens in at-risk people. The criteria are used in geriatrics clinical care to monitor and improve the quality of care. They are also used in training, research, and healthcare policy to assist in developing performance measures and document outcomes. These criteria include lists of medications in which the potential risks may be greater than the potential benefits for people 65 and older. By considering this information, practitioners may be able to reduce harmful side effects caused by such medications. The Beers Criteria are intended to serve as a guide for clinicians and not as a substitute for professional judgment in prescribing decisions. The criteria may be used in conjunction with other information to guide clinicians about safe prescribing in older adults. History Geriatrician Mark H. Beers formulated the Beers Criteria through a consensus panel of experts using the Delphi method. The criteria were originally published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 1991 and updated in 1997, 2003, 2012, 2015, and most recently in January 2019. Management of criteria In 2011, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) convened an eleven-member multidisciplinary panel of experts in geriatric medicine, nursing, and pharmacotherapy to develop the 2012 edition of the American Geriatrics Society Updated Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults. The 2012 AGS Beers Criteria differ from previous editions in several ways. In addition to using a modified Delphi process for building consensus, the expert panel followed the evidence- based approach that AGS has used since it developed its first practice guideline on persistent pain in 1998. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 2011 report, Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, recommended that all guideline developers complete a systematic review of the evidence. Following the recommendation of the IOM, AGS added a public comment period that occurred in parallel to its standard invited external peer review process. In a significant departure from previous versions of the criteria, each recommendation is rated for quality of both the evidence supporting the panel's recommendations and the strength of their recommendations. In another departure from the 2003 criteria, the 2012 AGS Beers Criteria identify and group medications that may be inappropriate for older adults into three different categories instead of the previous two. The first category includes medications that are potentially inappropriate for older people because they either pose high risks of adverse effects or appear to have limited effectiveness in older patients, and because there are alternatives to these medications. The second category includes medications that are potentially inappropriate for older people who have certain diseases or disorders because these drugs may exacerbate the specified health problems. The third category includes medications that, although they may be associated with more risks than benefits in general, may be the best choice for a particular individual if administered with caution. The 2012 AGS Beers Criteria was released in February 2012 via publication in the early online edition of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. The most recent update to the Beers criteria was completed in 2019. Style of the publication Drugs listed on the Beers List are categorized according to risks for negative outcomes. The tables include medications that have cautions, should be avoided, should be avoided with concomitant medical conditions, and are contraindicated and relatively contraindicated in the elderly population. An example of an included drug is diphenhydramine (Benadryl), a first-generation H1 antagonist with anticholinergic properties, which may increase sedation and lead to confusion or falls.

He served as the head coach at the University of Georgia from 1939 to 1960, compiling a record of 140‚Äì86‚Äì9. His Georgia Bulldogs football teams won a national championships in 1942 and four Southeastern Conference titles (1942, 1946, 1948, 1959). Butts was also the athletic director at Georgia from 1939 to 1963. He was inducted posthumously into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1997. Playing career Butts was a 1929 graduate of Mercer University where he played college football under coach Bernie Moore, as well as baseball and basketball. He was an alumnus of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Coaching career Butts never failed to turn out an undefeated championship team at the three high schools he coached before arriving at the University of Georgia in 1938. He coached at Madison (Ga.) A&M; from 1928‚Äì31; Georgia Military College in Milledgeville, 1932‚Äì34; and Male High in Louisville, 1935-37. Butts lost only ten games in ten years of high school coaching. Butts came to the University of Georgia as an assistant to Joel Hunt in 1938. Hunt left after a 5‚Äì4‚Äì1 season to take over at the University of Wyoming and Butts was elevated to the position of head coach, which he held for 22 seasons through 1960. Butts' assistants in his first year as head coach were Bill Hartman, Howell Hollis, Quinton Lumpkin, Jules V. Sikes, Forrest Towns, and Jennings B. Whitworth. During his tenure as head coach, Georgia won its first consensus national championship in 1942 and claimed another national title in 1946.Georgia Football National Championships Ralph Jordan, future head football coach at Auburn University, joined the Georgia coaching staff in October 1946 as an assistant line coach. Butts was a proponent of the passing game in an era of \\"three yards and a cloud of dust\\". He developed innovative, intricate pass routes that were studied by other coaches. He was often called \\"the little round man\\" as he was five feet, six inches tall and had a squat body. Butts coached 1942 Heisman Trophy winner Frank Sinkwich and 1946 Maxwell Award winner Charley Trippi. The 1942 Georgia team won the Rose Bowl over UCLA, finished #2 in the AP Poll, and was named a national championship by a number of selectors. Butts' teams also won four Southeastern Conference championships (1942, 1946, 1948 and 1959).All-Time Winningest Division I-A Teams As head coach, Butts posted a 140‚Äì86‚Äì9 record (.615 winning percentage), including a bowl record of 5‚Äì2‚Äì1.Official 2006 NCAA Divisions I-A and II-A Football Records Book, page 331 Johnny Griffith, a former player and assistant coach to Butts, succeeded him as head coach from 1961-63. Later life and honors Butts resigned as UGA's head football coach in December 1960. He remained as athletic director until February 1963, when he resigned after a scandal erupted over a magazine article alleging corrupt practices, which Butts stridently denied. In 1963, Butts filed a libel lawsuit against The Saturday Evening Post after it ran \\"The Story of a College Football Fix\\" in its March 23, 1963, issue alleging that he and Alabama head coach Bear Bryant had conspired to fix an upcoming Georgia-Alabama game. The University of Georgia and Georgia Attorney General Eugene Cook conducted separate investigations. Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, as it ultimately became when it reached the Supreme Court, was a landmark case that expanded the definition of \\"public figures\\" in libel cases. The court ruled in his favor in 1967, and The Saturday Evening Post was ordered to pay $3.06 million to the Butts family in damages, the largest settlement awarded at its time in history. This settlement was seen as a contributing factor among many others in the demise of the venerable Saturday Evening Post six years later. Both Butts and Bryant had sued for $10 million each. Bryant settled for $300,000. In 1986, Professor James Kirby of the University of Tennessee School of Law published Fumble: Bear Bryant, Wally Butts and the Great College Football Scandal, which argued that the courts had made the wrong decision. Kirby had been the Southeastern Conference's official observer at the trial. Butts was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1966 and posthumously into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997. Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall, athletic administration offices and sports museum at the University of Georgia, was built in honor of Butts and his predecessor as coach, Harry Mehre. After ending his football career, Butts established a credit insurance business in Athens and Atlanta, where he became very successful. Butts died of a heart attack after returning from a walk in 1973. He was buried in Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens, Georgia. Family Butts was the son of James Wallace Butts, Sr. (July 9, 1881 ‚Äì January 2, 1959) and wife Annie (1881 ‚Äì ?). Wally married Winifred Faye Taylor (July 12, 1907 ‚Äì June 27, 1990) on February 19, 1929. They had three daughters, Faye, Jean and Nancy. Butts had numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren.

Alonso (or Alfonso) de Burgos (before 1477 ‚Äì 1499) was the royal confessor of Ferdinand and Isabella. He was born of a noble family in Burgos and died at Valladolid in 1499. He was conspicuous for learning before his entrance into the Dominican order, early in life. His preaching attracted the notice of Ferdinand and Isabella, who selected him as royal confessor. On the recommendation of the latter, Alfonso was appointed to the see of C√≥rdoba by Sixtus IV, 30 April 1477. Remaining there only four years, he was transferred to the Bishopric of Cuenca, and in 1484, or according to P. B. Gams (Series Episcoporum, P. 64) in 1486, to Palencia. At the same time he held successively the office of Grand Chaplain of the Court, Counsellor of the Catholic King, and President of the Council of Castile. In the latter capacity he was instrumental in getting pecuniary grants from the crown for Columbus. During the years 1487 and 1488 he obtained eight thousand pounds at various times for the fitting out of a fleet. In the absence of the king he exercised his right as President of the Council in giving orders for a payment of three thousand pounds to the discoverer. These duties did not hinder him from repairing many dilapidated churches of his diocese. He built, out of his own revenues, the Dominican convent of St. Vincent Ferrer at Palencia, in 1486. He takes a high rank in the history of Spanish education for completing the Colegio de San Gregorio at Valladolid, begun by King Alfonso the Wise (1252‚Äì1284). Posterity justly calls him the founder of this famous college of his order.

A member of both the Pro Football and Packers Halls of Fame, Hutson was the dominant player of his era, setting records that stood for 50 years after his retirement. The Don Hutson Center is the largest element of the Packers' practice complex, which includes Ray Nitschke Field and Clarke Hinkle Field, which were also named after Packer greats. There are two practice fields inside the Center: a field runs east‚Äìwest, with another field running north‚Äìsouth, allowing the offense and defense to practice simultaneously. With and high ceilings over the respective fields, the facility allows the special teams to run full punting and kicking practices. The FieldTurf surfaces allow the Packers to replicate game conditions for road games where they will have to play indoors or on artificial surfaces. The Packers' video department has elevated camera positions on the inside of the Hutson Center for filming practices, as well as four porches on the exterior of the west side for filming practices at Clarke Hinkle Field. The Center was dedicated on July 18, 1994, at a ceremony presided over by the then 81-year-old Hutson himself.

Background Bill Wilson, a farmer in Blount County, Alabama, married Jenny Wade in 1900. Their third child was born in 1907. Jenny left her husband 19 months later and returned to her family. Bill moved in with his father Si, taking the two older children with him. During the divorce proceedings, Jenny and the child disappeared. Shortly before Jenny was last seen, Jane McClendon, a local farmer's daughter, had mysteriously disappeared and for several weeks rumours circulated that foul play was involved in both disappearances. In late 1912, Dolphus Tidwell and his son were fishing on the Black Warrior River near the property of Bill's father when they noticed a bone sticking out of the soil. The Tidwells found a mat under the soil which exposed what they believed to be the skeletons of an adult and a child. Believing there may be an Indian burial mound nearby they searched the area for relics but found nothing. They re- buried the bones and returned home. News of the discovery spread and for several days locals searched the area for Indian artifacts until they lost interest. Jim House, a casual laborer who occasionally worked for Si Wilson, began telling anyone who would listen that he believed the remains belonged to Jenny and her daughter. He recounted how he had seen Jenny visit her father- in-law's house carrying a basket in 1908 and that the following morning he noticed footprints leading to the river. Following the footprints he found children's clothing and blood on a rock. The story soon spread until the county solicitor, James Embry, heard it. Embry called a grand jury and Bill Wilson was indicted for the murder of his wife and baby. Trial James Embry prosecuted the case before judge J. E. Blackwood. In his opening remarks he said that Jenny Wilson went to her father-in-law's house to visit her two older children late in November or early December, 1908. A quarrel had occurred that night and Bill Wilson murdered his wife and child, took the bodies to the bluff, and burned them. Prosecution evidence Dolphus Tidwell testified to finding the bones and they were placed into evidence as those of Jenny Wilson and her 19-month-old infant. Dr. Marvin Denton testified for the state in regards to his findings from an examination of the bones. Although he agreed that the bones belonged to an adult and child, he noted that the child had permanent teeth which do not appear until around the age of six. He testified that he had never seen permanent teeth in a child under the age of four. Jim House repeated his story about Jenny's visit to the Wilson farm, adding that he was concerned for her safety and had tried to talk her out of going. When he met Bill the following day he asked him about his wife. He stated that Bill denied that she had visited the farm. He then found the footprints and followed them to the spot where he found blood stains. A convict who had a cell near Wilson, Mack Holcomb, testified that he overheard Wilson tell his eldest daughter Ruthie: \\"If you tell anything I will tend to you when I get out.\\" Seven-year-old Ruthie was cross examined about this statement and stated that her father had actually said that if she was not a good girl he would punish her when he got out of jail. Several locals recounted conversations with Wilson where he showed animosity towards Jenny or made comments indicating she would not return. Defense evidence Lizzie McClendon, mother of Jane McClendon who had gone missing shortly before Jenny, told the jury that House visited her after her daughter vanished and said that he would testify that he saw the Wilsons kill her daughter if she would swear out a warrant for their arrest. Under cross examination, House denied the claim but did admit to ill feeling between himself and Bill Wilson. Six witnesses, including Jenny's sister, swore that they had seen Jenny at various times in 1909 and that she was living with a man named John Wilson (no relation). A friend of Jenny's, Mrs Benton Cornelius, testified that Jenny told her in April 1908 that she intended to move to Missouri after the separation. Bill's brother John, his sister Frances, his daughter Ruthie, and John Rice, who worked for Si Wilson, all denied that Jenny had visited the Wilson home at any time after the separation.Collins, Wilkie (2005), p. 163. Testimony was given that the female skeleton had no dental work. Jenny had fillings in her two front teeth. Dr. J. F. Hancock, said that he believed that the bones were at least ten years old, that the adult skeleton belonged to an elderly person and that the child's permanent teeth excluded that skeleton from being that of a 19-month-old baby. Verdict On December 18, 1915, the jury found Bill Wilson guilty, and convicted him of murder in the first degree. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, to be served at Alabama's Wetumpka State Penitentiary. An appeal was overturned and several petitions for a pardon were also rejected. Pardon In 1916, Dr. Ale≈° Hrdliƒçka, curator of physical anthropology of the Smithsonian Institution, declared the bones to be parts of at least four or five individuals, that they were very old and that there was nothing to indicate that they were not of Indigenous origin. The trial judge, J. E. Blackwood, believing that Wilson was innocent, pressured the Governor and the Attorney-General unsuccessfully to commute the sentence. By this time the public accepted Wilson's innocence, with the exception of the prosecutor, James Embry who blocked all attempts to obtain a pardon. In 1918, Wilson's former appeal lawyer located Jenny Wilson and her daughter, now aged 11, living in Vincennes, Indiana, with her second husband. She returned to Blount County on July 8 and signed an affidavit giving a complete account of her movements from the time she disappeared until she was found. The same day, the governor granted a full pardon and Wilson was released. Aftermath On February 15, 1919, the Alabama Legislature enacted a statute for the appointment of a commission to determine the amount of compensation Wilson would officially receive, \\"up to the amount of $3,500\\" (), \\"for services rendered [to] the state while in prison,\\" rather than compensation for wrongful imprisonment. An award for the maximum amount of $3,500 was entrusted to the state public trustee, a Blount County probate court judge, who subsequently fled the state with the money. Wilson sued the judge's bondsman to recover the compensation due, an action which cost him $700 in legal fees ($ in ). It is unknown how much he received but it is believed to be around $2,500 ($ in ). Wilson used the money to buy a small farm but got into debt and lost it. The last record of Wilson indicates he was working as a day laborer digging coal in an Alabama mine. See also * List of wrongful convictions in the United States * Wilson v.

History Bahman Ghobadi, Iranian/Kurdish film director at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival. The Kurdish cinema was shaped by the fate of the Kurds as people without a state. Kurdish movies often show social grievances, oppression, torture, human rights violations and life as a stranger. The Kurdish cinema has a high significance for the Kurds, as it offers the opportunity to draw attention in an artistic way to their own situation. However, due to state repression, filming is not an easy matter. So most films are produced in exile. The best example of this is Turkey, where the Kurds were not allowed to speak their mother tongue until 1991; which made the development of Kurdish film difficult. One of the founding father of Kurdish cinema, a figure that is admired by Kurdish Filmmakers today is Yilmaz G√ºney, despite all restrictions that were forced upon him by the Turkish Government, G√ºney managed to portray the richness of Kurdish cultures in his films, such as in S√ºr√º and Yol. Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney started making films in the 1950s. For his film Yol - The Road from 1982, he received the Palme d\`Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His death in 1984 in Paris meant the end of Kurdish film for a long time, just where he came to international fame. However, in 1991 another Kurdish film called A Song for Beko by Nizamettin Ari√ß from German-Armenian production followed. In 1992, Mem √ª Z√Æn followed by director √úmit El√ßi from a Turkish production. The film Siyabend and Xec√™ dates back to 1993 and was also produced in Turkey. The number of film releases is steadily rising u. a. Productions from Iran. Bahman Ghobadi, for example, received the Peace Film Prize for his film at the Berlinale in Berlin for his movie \\"Tortoises can fly\\". Over the years Kurdish cinema has symbolized mainly the sufferings of the Kurdish people in the Middle East. Miraz Bezar's movie Min D√Æt: The Children of Diyarbakƒ±r won awards at the film festivals in San Sebastian, Hamburg, and Gent. Also it was the first movie at a Turkish film festival in the Kurdish language ever at Golden Orange Film Festival in Antalya and won the special prize of the jury. In the last couple of years in Germany and Switzerland film production companies are created by Kurdish filmmakers in exile, who receive public funding from the states they lived in, for example, NEWA Film Berlin or Frame Film GmbH Bern. Yilmaz G√ºney, Jano Rosebiani, Bahman Qubadi, Shawkat Amin Korky, Mano Khalil, Hisham Zaman, Sahim Omar Kalifa and Y√ºksel Yavuz are among the better known Kurdish directors. Some Kurdish Filmmakers live and work outside Kurdistan, such as Hiner Saleem.

These fields, together with the Don Hutson Center, comprise the team's training complex. The field is named for Ray Nitschke, who played for the Packers from 1958 to 1972 and whose number 66 was retired by the team. Nitschke is a member of both the Pro Football and Packers Hall of Fames. On June 18, 2003, the Brown County Board voted 23‚Äì0 to approve a new lease for Ray Nitschke Field which gave the Packers the use of the site through 2020. The lease began in 2004 and started at $125,000 with an increase of $5,000 in each succeeding year. The Packers had been leasing the field from the County since 1997 for $15,000 a year. This field had an artificial FieldTurf surface, installed in 2004 (Clarke Hinkle Field has a natural grass surface). The Packers have since signed a 15-year lease with Brown County to move the field closer to the Don Hutson Center, with their paying $200,000 to the county this year and increasing $6,500 each subsequent year. The new location is in a former parking lot for the Resch Center and as part of the deal the Packers had to build a 205-space parking lot at the former site of Nitschke Field. On August 1, 2009, the Packers unveiled major renovations to the practice facility, including bleacher seating for 1500 fans, a sound system for announcements and music as well as natural grass field with underground heating.

The composition was influenced by Melozzo da Forl√¨'s perspective and includes the decoration of the dome base, which represents the four protector saints of Parma: St. John the Baptist with the lamb, St. Hilary with a yellow mantle, St. Thomas (or Joseph)More likely to be Saint Joseph carrying a staff according to David Ekserdjian, in \\"Correggio in Parma Cathedral: Not Thomas but Joseph\\", The Burlington Magazine (1986); pp. 412+414-415. with an angel carrying the martyrdom palm leaf, and St. Bernard, the sole figure looking upwards. Below the feet of Jesus, the uncorrupt Virgin in red and blue robes is lofted upward by a vortex of singing or otherwise musical angels. Ringing the base of the dome, between the windows, stand the perplexed Apostles, as if standing around the empty tomb in which they have just placed her. In the group of the blessed can be seen: Adam and Eve, Judith with the head of Holofernes. At the centre of the dome is a foreshortened beardless Jesus descending to meet his mother. Correggio's Assumption would eventually serve as a catalyst and inspiration for the dramatically- illusionistic, di sotto in su ceiling paintings of the 17th-century Baroque period. In Correggio's work, and in the work of his Baroque heirs, the entire architectural surface is treated as a single pictorial unit of vast proportions and opened up via painting, so that the dome of the church is equated with the vault of heaven. The illusionistic manner in which the figures seem to protrude into the spectators' space was, at the time, an audacious and astounding use of foreshortening, though the technique later became common among Baroque artists who specialized in illusionistic vault decoration. Among many other works, Correggio's Assumption inspired Carlo Cignani for his fresco Assumption of the Virgin, in the cathedral church of Forl√¨; and Giovanni Lanfranco's fresco of the dome in the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome.

Typically there is about one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host them, but some galaxies contain many. The Milky Way has not been shown to contain a ULX. The main interest in ULXs stems from their luminosity exceeding the Eddington luminosity of neutron stars and even stellar black holes. It is not known what powers ULXs; models include beamed emission of stellar mass objects, accreting intermediate-mass black holes, and super-Eddington emission. Observational facts ULXs were first discovered in the 1980s by the Einstein Observatory. Later observations were made by ROSAT. Great progress has been made by the X-ray observatories XMM-Newton and Chandra, which have a much greater spectral and angular resolution. A survey of ULXs by Chandra observations shows that there is approximately one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host ULXs (most do not). ULXs are found in all types of galaxies, including elliptical galaxies but are more ubiquitous in star-forming galaxies and in gravitationally interacting galaxies. Tens of percents of ULXs are in fact background quasars; the probability for a ULX to be a background source is larger in elliptical galaxies than in spiral galaxies. Models The fact that ULXs have Eddington luminosities larger than that of stellar mass objects implies that they are different from normal X-ray binaries. There are several models for ULXs, and it is likely that different models apply for different sources. Beamed emission ‚Äî If the emission of the sources is strongly beamed, the Eddington argument is circumvented twice: first because the actual luminosity of the source is lower than inferred, and second because the accreted gas may come from a different direction than that in which the photons are emitted. Modelling indicates that stellar mass sources may reach luminosities up to 1040 erg/s (1033 W), enough to explain most of the sources, but too low for the most luminous sources. If the source is stellar mass and has a thermal spectrum, its temperature should be high, temperature times the Boltzmann constant kT ‚âà 1 keV, and quasi-periodic oscillations are not expected. Intermediate-mass black holes ‚Äî Black holes are observed in nature with masses of the order of ten times the mass of the Sun, and with masses of millions to billions the solar mass. The former are 'stellar black holes', the end product of massive stars, while the latter are supermassive black holes, and exist in the centers of galaxies. Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a hypothetical third class of objects, with masses in the range of hundreds to thousands of solar masses. Intermediate-mass black holes are light enough not to sink to the center of their host galaxies by dynamical friction, but sufficiently massive to be able to emit at ULX luminosities without exceeding the Eddington limit. If a ULX is an intermediate-mass black hole, in the high/soft state it should have a thermal component from an accretion disk peaking at a relatively low temperature (kT ‚âà 0.1 keV) and it may exhibit quasi-periodic oscillation at relatively low frequencies. An argument made in favor of some sources as possible IMBHs is the analogy of the X-ray spectra as scaled-up stellar mass black hole X-ray binaries. The spectra of X-ray binaries have been observed to go through various transition states. The most notable of these states are the low/hard state and the high/soft state (see Remillard & McClintock 2006). The low/hard state or power-law dominated state is characterized by an absorbed power-law X-ray spectrum with spectral index from 1.5 to 2.0 (hard X-ray spectrum). Historically, this state was associated with a lower luminosity, though with better observations with satellites such as RXTE, this is not necessarily the case. The high/soft state is characterized by an absorbed thermal component (blackbody with a disk temperature of (kT ‚âà 1.0 keV) and power-law (spectral index ‚âà 2.5). At least one ULX source, Holmberg II X-1, has been observed in states with spectra characteristic of both the high and low state. This suggests that some ULXs may be accreting IMBHs (see Winter, Mushotzky, Reynolds 2006). Background quasars ‚Äî A significant fraction of observed ULXs are in fact background sources. Such sources may be identified by a very low temperature (e.g. the soft excess in PG quasars). Supernova remnants ‚Äî Bright supernova (SN) remnants may perhaps reach luminosities as high as 1039 erg/s (1032 W). If a ULX is a SN remnant it is not variable on short time-scales, and fades on a time-scale of the order of a few years. Notable ULXs *Holmberg II X-1: This famous ULX resides in a dwarf galaxy. Multiple observations with XMM have revealed the source in both a low/hard and high/soft state, suggesting that this source could be a scaled-up X-ray binary or accreting IMBH. *M74: Possibly containing an intermediate-mass black hole, as observed by Chandra in 2005. *M82 X-1: This is the most luminous known ULX (as of Oct 2004), and has often been marked as the best candidate to host an intermediate-mass black hole. M82-X1 is associated with a star cluster, exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), has a modulation of 62 days in its X-ray amplitude. *M82 X-2: An unusual ULX that was discovered in 2014 to be a pulsar rather than a black hole. *M101-X1: One of the brightest ULXs, with luminosities up to 1041 erg/s (1034 W). This ULX coincides with an optical source that has been interpreted to be a supergiant star, thus supporting the case that this may be an X-ray binary. *NGC 1313 X1 and X2: NGC 1313, a spiral galaxy in the constellation Reticulum, contains two ultraluminous X-ray sources. These two sources had low temperature disk components, which is interpreted as possible evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole.

It lies lateral to the abductor digiti minimi when the hand is in anatomical position. Structure The flexor digiti minimi brevis arises from the hamulus of the hamate bone and the palmar surface of the flexor retinaculum of the hand. It is inserted into the medial side of the base of the proximal phalanx of digit V. It is separated from the abductor digiti minimi, at its origin, by the deep branches of the ulnar artery and the ulnar nerve. The flexor digiti minimi brevis is sometimes not present; in these cases, the abductor digiti minimi is usually larger than normal. The flexor digiti minimi brevis is one of three muscles in the hypothenar muscle group. These three muscles form the fleshy mass at the base of the little finger, and are solely concerned with the movement of digit V. The other two muscles that make up the hypothenar muscle group are the abductor digiti minimi and the opponens digiti minimi. In anatomical position from medial to lateral is the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, and opponens digiti minimi. Innervation The flexor digiti minimi brevis, like other hypothenar muscles, is innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve arises from the spinal nerve levels C8-T1. The spinal roots of C8 and T1 then merge to form the lower trunk, anterior division, medial cord, and finally produce the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve has a superficial and deep branch, but it is the deep branch that innervates the flexor digiti minimi brevis. Actions The flexor digiti minimi brevis flexes the little finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Etymology The name of this muscle is Latin for the 'short flexor of the little finger'. Note that brevis is usually included to differentiate it from a longus muscle of the same name. The flexor digiti minimi longus, however, is not found in the typical human, but instead is a rare anatomical variation. Additional images File:Gray219.png|Bones of the left hand. Volar surface.

By an act of Parliament in 1998, Springer was named as one of the ten National Heroes of Barbados.  Early life and education  In Barbados Springer was educated at Harrison College. Upon receiving a Barbados Scholarship in Classics, Springer studied Greek as an undergraduate at Hertford College, University of Oxford, receiving a BA in 1936.  Career   Law and politics  He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1938, and subsequently returned to Barbados. He practised at the Bar in Barbados from 1938‚Äì47. He co-founded the Progressive League with the barrister Grantley Adams. As General Secretary of the League, Springer transformed it into two initially closely related organisations, the Barbados Labour Party and the Barbados Workers' Union. From 1940-47 he was the General Secretary of the Barbados Labour Party and also General Secretary of the Barbados Workers‚Äô Union. In 1940 he was elected to the House of Assembly.  Higher education  Springer perceived Higher Education as vitally important for achieving regional cooperation and integration. He had previously sought employment in education in London in the 1930s, but was rejected on the basis of his ethnicity. In 1938 he taught Classics temporarily at Codrington College. He was a member of the Asquith Commission on Higher Education in the West Indies in the 1950s and sat on the Provisional Council of the University College at Kingston which was founded as an outcome of the commission. In 1947 resigned from the Cabinet of Barbados and took up the position as the Registrar of the University College of West Indies, which he held until 1963, when he became Director until 1966.  International politics  Following the collapse of the Federation of the West Indies in 1962, Springer dedicated time to considering regional politics. He received a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship and a Fellowship of the Harvard Centre for International Affairs where he completed his 1962 book Reflections on the Failure of the First West Indian Federation. During 1962-63 he was a Senior Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, University of Oxford. On returning to Barbados, Springer was appointed as the Director of the Institute of Education at the University of the West Indies.  Commonwealth and international education  Springer dedicated much of the period from 1964‚Äì84 to the areas of commonwealth and international education. He was Assistant Secretary- General (Education) at the Commonwealth Secretariat (1966‚Äì1970), and Secretary General of the Association of Commonwealth Universities (1970‚Äì1980) and Director of the United World College(1978‚Äì1990). He was appointed Governor-General of Barbados in 1984, a position which he held until he retired due to ill-health in 1990.  Honours  Springer received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1976, and was elected as an honorary fellow of Hertford College, Oxford in 1974 and All Souls College in 1988. Springer received a Doctor of Civil Law from the University of New Brunswick in 1980. A portrait of Hugh Springer by Hector Whistler is on display in the hall of All Souls College. In 1998, Hugh Springer was named as one of the ten Barbadian National Heroes, designated by the Order of National Heroes Act. A biography of Hugh Springer was published in 2008, authored by Kean H.

N. The Geographical Journal. Vol. 112, No 4/6 (Oct. - Dec., 1948), pp. 258-259. He was also an author and radio personality. Life Gould grew up in Southsea, near Portsmouth, where his father, William Monk Gould, was a music teacher, organist, and composer. He was educated at Eastman's Royal Naval Academy and then, from 15 January 1906 on, he attended the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and then the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, being part of the 'Greynville' term (group), and by Easter 1907, examinations placed him at the top of his class. He became a midshipman, and thereby a naval officer, on 15 May 1907. He initially served on HMS Formidable and HMS Queen (under Captain David Beatty) in the Mediterranean. Subsequently, he was posted to China (first aboard HMS Kinsha and then HMS Bramble). He chose the \\"navigation\\" career track and, after qualifying as a navigation officer, served on HMS King George V, and HMS Achates until near the outbreak of World War I, at which time he suffered a nervous breakdown and went on medical leave. During his lengthy recuperation, he was stationed at the Hydrographer's Department at the Admiralty, where he became an expert on various aspects of naval history, cartography, and expeditions of the polar regions. In 1919 he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander (retired). On 9 June 1917 he married Muriel Estall. That marriage ended by judicial separation in November 1927. They had two children, Cecil (born in 1918) and Jocelyne (born in 1920). His last years were spent at Barford St Martin near Salisbury, where he used his horological skills to repair and restore the defunct clock in the church tower.Betts, Jonathan, 2006 Work He gained permission in 1920 to restore the marine chronometers of John Harrison, and this work was completed in 1933. His horological book The Marine Chronometer, its history and development was first published in 1923 by J.D. Potter and was the first scholarly monograph on the subject. It was generally considered the authoritative text on marine timekeepers for at least half a century. Gould had many other interests and activities. In spite of two more nervous breakdowns he wrote and published an eclectic series of books on topics ranging from horology to the Loch Ness Monster. He was a science educator, giving a series of talks for the BBC's Children's Hour starting in January 1934 under the name \\"The Stargazer\\", and these collected talks were later published. He was a member of the BBC radio panel The Brains Trust. He umpired tennis matches on the Centre Court at Wimbledon on many occasions during the 1930s. In 1947 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the British Horological Institute, its highest honour for contributions to horology. Gould died on 5 October 1948 at Canterbury, Kent, from heart failure. He was 57 years of age. Longitude, a television dramatisation of Dava Sobel's book Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time, recounted in part Gould's work in restoring the Harrison chronometers. In the drama, Gould was played by Jeremy Irons. Cryptozoology and paranormal interests Gould took interest in investigating cryptozoological and paranormal claims. Spurred on by the attention to the Loch Ness Monster in the popular press (news) and his previous work on the sea serpent, Gould spent some days at Loch Ness travelling around it by motorcycle. He interviewed many witnesses and collated evidence for the creature that resulted in the first major work on the phenomenon, entitled The Loch Ness Monster and Others. After this, Gould became the de facto spokesman on the subject, being a regular contributor to radio shows and newspaper articles.

At the age of 11 he became a student at the Conservatorio di S Maria di Loreto in Naples, where he remained until 1733, studying counterpoint with Francesco Mancini, singing and keyboard playing with Giovanni Veneziano, and violin with Francesco Barbella. On completion of his studies, Perez immediately entered the service of the Sicilian Prince d‚ÄôAragona, Naselli. From 1734 date his first known pieces, the Latin cantatas Ilium Palladio astu Subducto Expugnatum and Palladium performed in Palermo's Collegio della Societ√† di Ges√π, for the laurelling festivities. In the following years, he was active both in Palermo and Naples, as his patron became Chamberlain of the newly crowned king, Carlo I. His first opera, La nemica amante, was composed for the king's birthday on 4 November 1735 and presented in the gardens of the Neapolitan royal palace and later in the Teatro S Bartolomeo. In the libretto's dedication the impresario of the theatre, Angelo Carasale, referred to Perez and Pergolesi as 'dei buoni virtuosi di questa citt√†'. Unlike Pergolesi's opera, which was then considered a failure, Perez's was a great success, and his early career granted him, in 1738, an appointment as vicemaestro di cappella at Palermo's Cappella Palatina, the Church of St. Peter in the royal palace, to become maestro the next year upon the death of its former titular, Pietro Puzzuolo. Maturity In the early 1740s Perez firmly established himself as a mature master. The opera he composed for the Roman Teatro d‚ÄôAlibert, in the Carnival of 1740, was not presented due to the sudden death of Pope Clement XII, but on Perez's return to Naples he staged an opera buffa, I travestimenti amorosi and a serenata L‚Äôamor pittore for the court, and an opera seria, Il Siroe, for the Teatro San Carlo. Caffarelli and Manzuoli sang in the later. Opera was not an easy enterprise in Palermo and, until 1745, most of Perez's compositions as chapel master there were cantatas or serenatas and church music - including in 1742 a setting of Metastasio's oratorio La Passione di Ges√π Cristo. In addition he composed church music for Naples, and two operas for the Genovese Carnival season of 1744. After March 1748 Perez was granted a leave of absence and never returned to Palermo, though he continued to receive half of his Palermo salary until his death. In rapid succession, he then staged his operas in Naples, Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Turin, and Vienna. In February 1749 Perez competed with Niccol√≤ Jommelli in a public examination for the position as chapel master in the Vatican. The influence of Cardinal Albani and Cardinal Passionei granted Jommelli the appointment, even though Perez was the musicians' favourite (Girolamo Chiti, the chapel master of another Papal chapel, St. John in Lateran, commented that Perez 'composes, sings and plays as an angel' and 'is very much superior to Jommelli in groundwork, singing and playing. He is, however, an imaginary hypochondriac'). Career in Portugal In 1752 King Jos√© I of Portugal invited Perez to become mestre de capela and music master to the royal princesses, a position he occupied until his death. The annual stipend of 2:000$000 (two contos de r√©is), coupled with the excellent musical and theatrical resources of the Portuguese court, undoubtedly influenced his decision to remain in Lisbon. The ambition of the recently crowned Portuguese king was to depart from his father's musical policy, almost uniquely concerned with church music, and to give Italian opera a central position in the court. Sumptuous scenic treatment was the rule, and Perez's operas were mounted by such famous designers as Berardi, Dorneau, Bouteux and Galli-Bibiena. Equally important were the great singers who appeared at the Portuguese court, including Raaf, Elisi, Manzuoli, Gizziello and Caffarelli. The terrible earthquake that destroyed Lisbon on 1 November 1755, changed forever Perez's output. The √ìpera do Tejo was destroyed six months after opening and the court withdrew from the theatres. No operas were produced for the next seven years, and thereafter only in a less spectacular fashion. During the last 23 years of his life, Perez wrote just three new operas. Instead he composed a huge amount of church music, covering almost all the rituals and practices of the two main musical chapels of Lisbon, the Royal and the Semin√°rio da Patriarcal. He never left Portugal, so that his international acclaim slowly declined. Still, Gerber noted that since 1766 Perez's compositions were known and in demand in Germany and that he was in 1790 'one of the most celebrated and beloved composers among the Italian masters ... one of the latest composers who maintained the rigour of counterpoint'. J. C. Krause named Hasse, Perez and Paisiello as satisfactory models. In 1774 Perez became by acclamation a member of the London Academy of Ancient Music, and had the only full-scale piece printed in his lifetime, the Mattutino de' Morti (his third set of the Office of the Dead), published there by Bremner. His music, especially the religious, was widely copied in Italy. During the last four years of his life Perez suffered from a chronic disease, eventually losing his sight, but continued to compose. In 1778 his pupil, now Queen Maria I of Portugal, made him a Knight of the Order of Christ; when he died in Lisbon, she ordered an elaborate funeral at the Crown's expense. Operas Perez composed more than 44 dramatic works between 1735 and 1777, 22 operas between 1744 and 1755, the period when he almost exclusively concentrated on the genre. Excerpts from Arminio, La Didone abbandonata, Ezio, Farnace, Solimano and Vologeso were published in London by John Walsh, and at least 24 exist in manuscript. In the opere serie written before 1752 Perez was often bound by the forms of Metastasian opera. Il Siroe, Andromaca and Alessandro nell‚ÄôIndie (1744 version) are prime examples: 20 or more full da capo arias (more than half accompanied by strings alone) are consistently used, with between one and four accompanied recitatives, usually a single duet, a perfunctory three-movement sinfonia and a simple choral finale for the principals. The arias are usually written in the Baroque concerto idiom, with extravagant word painting in the orchestra and extensive vocal bravura passages. Adhering to Metastasio's prescription of character definition as the sum of a pattern of dramatic reversals, each aria usually depicts a single affect, with few exceptions: Artaserse and Alessandro each contain a scene complex of related arias and accompanied recitatives. With Demofoonte in 1752, as Perez began his lengthy residence in Lisbon, the monumental idiom declined and a sentimental style gained increasing prominence, with a resultant clarity of texture, greater symmetry of phrase, frequent rhythmic motives and emphasis on the pathetic. Formal modifications include the frequent absence of ritornellos, truncated da capo arias, between five and nine accompanied recitatives and several small ensembles. Perez's operas of the 1750s frequently display an orchestral mastery superior to that of the contemporary Italian opera school, incorporating features that during the 1740s he could only use in his church music. The strings are in three to five parts, the wind are often used for solo passages, and there is less doubling of the vocal parts and an increase in concertante passages. Among the better examples of this later manner are Olimpiade, Demofoonte, Ipermestra and Alessandro nell‚ÄôIndie (1755 version). Demetrio (1766 version) represents a transitional aesthetic, in which Perez combined a modified Baroque dramaturgy with a more up-to-date musical style: he eliminated 14 Metastasio aria texts, used eight accompanied recitatives and two duets for moments of personal reflection, and gave the da capo aria more musical and dramatic coherence. Solimano (1768) is his acknowledged masterpiece. It contains 14 dal segno arias, one cavatina and six accompanied recitatives, the scope and procedures of which are exceptional; several times the individual numbers are integrated into large-scale scene complexes. Kretzschmar (1919) claimed that Solimano 'belongs under the heading of masterworks ... richness of invention and of feeling, originality of means and of form, everything is therein, which makes an art great' and 'if all opera composers of the Neapolitan school had been of his stamp, there would have been no need of a Gluck‚Äô.

In his earliest career he is reported by Florimo to have 'enriched with his compositions' Palermo's Cappella Palatina, but there are many pieces written for Naples as well. In Lisbon, the deep religiosity of his pupil, the Royal Princess Maria and his own, combined with the directions taken by the musical policy of the court, had himself concentrating in church music for the royal chapels for the last 23 years of his life. His first mass is dated February 1736, and most of his early works have very ample and careful use of orchestral and choral resources. For example, the mass dated 24 February 1740 is scored for two choirs (the final 'cum Sancto Spiritu' is a ten voice fugue), full strings divided, in some sections, in two orchestras, woodwinds (no clarinets), horns and trumpets in pairs. It displays a highly detailed orchestral writing: muted strings, seconda corda instructed in passages for the violins, plenty of orchestral crescendos and diminuendos, solo parts for the woodwinds and for the viola. In this period, Perez treated solo voices in a manner similar to operatic arias, most fugues or fugato sections have very symmetrical entries of themes, and the pieces in the so-called stile antico are conservative in harmony and notation. Unlike the operas, there is no definite date when it is possible to see a change in the style of Perez's late church music. However, the production in his later years at Lisbon is quite distinct from his earliest. The orchestral writing continued to be as detailed as before, but instruments like recorders and lutes are no longer to be found. There is less use of separated sections for solo voices. Most pieces are now concertate, that is, with one or more soloists emerging from the choir for short passages, thus creating numerous distinct vocal textures. A striking difference is the counterpoint technique, that, still being strict, became eloquent and sentimental. Now the pieces rarely show distinct sections in modern style and in archaistic counterpoint. In his later style, the musical presentation of the words acquired a pietist overtone. The sections alternate freely between polyphonic and chordal writing; the harmony is constantly elaborate; chromaticism is freely used. It is however a style that strongly favours variety over coherence, as there is not regular thematic recurrence throughout the pieces. Eighteenth century critics often ranked Perez with Hasse and Jommelli. Charles Burney found 'an original spirit and elegance in all his production'. Nineteenth and twentieth century commentary, based for the most part on very few earlier operas, has generally downgraded this judgement. A more complete examination of his works affirms the stature his contemporaries assigned to him. While he was essentially a transitional figure in eighteenth-century opera, he was nevertheless one of the great composers of opera seria. However it was in his later compositions for the church that Perez had the best possibility to develop his style. His is one of the finest corpuses of music for the Roman Catholic rituals in the eighteenth century. List of church music *Dottori, Mauricio.

Never afraid to speak her mind, and woe betide anyone who manages to get on her wrong side, Lou has the respect of her friends and family, even if they do find her a bit of a nuisance at times. Storylines Backstory Born in the East End at the outbreak of World War I, Lou lived in Walford all her life. She was born into a large working-class East End family, the youngest of seven siblings, and grew up with a strong sense of community spirit. In the 1930s, she fell in love with a local boy, Albert Beale (Gary Olson), and gave birth to his daughter, Maggie (Olivia Shanley), but had her adopted because she was born out of wedlock. By 1936, Lou and Albert had married and in 1938 moved to 45 Albert Square. They had six more children: Harry (Aaron Mason), Ronnie (Chase Marks), Dora, Kenny (Michael Attwell), and twins Pete (Peter Dean) and Pauline (Wendy Richard). Albert died in 1965, and Lou remained in the same house with Pauline and her husband, Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher). Lou regularly intervened in her family's affairs, especially when she disapproved of Pete's relationship with Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth) because he had previously divorced his first wife, Pat (Pam St Clement), and she had banished her son Kenny to New Zealand in the 1960s for having an affair with Pat. Lou then watched her grandchildren Michelle (Susan Tully), Mark (David Scarboro/Todd Carty) and Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) grow up, with Pauline, Pete, Arthur and Kathy looking after her in her old age. In one episode she claims she was one of seven children, one boy and six girls, and on Christmas Day 1987, she states she is from a family of eight, five boys and three girls. 1985‚Äì1988 Lou's affinity and ties with the area mean that she tends to view Albert Square as her own and thinks that gives her an excuse to intrude into people's business as she sees fit. She is great friends with Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), her lifelong neighbours. She also has a good relationship with the local general practitioner, Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton) and an old Jewish pawnbroker known only as 'Uncle' (Leonard Maguire). Lou has a tempestuous relationship with her children-in-law Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) and Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), blaming Kathy for Pete's first divorce (something Lou regards as unnatural, despite her fervent dislike of Pat), and showing displeasure at Arthur's unemployment; nothing he does is ever good enough for her daughter Pauline. In February 1985, she is furious to discover that Pauline is pregnant for the third time, her family already financially crippled by Arthur's long stint of unemployment. Lou gives Pauline and Arthur the choice of an abortion, having the baby adopted or keeping the baby, but they will not be allowed to live in her house. The family try to bring her round, but she finally is won round when the family organise her a holiday in Clacton-on-Sea. Lou supports her grandson Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) choice to work in catering, which Ian's father Pete does not approve of, wanting Ian to have a more masculine career. Lou is delighted at having another grandson named Martin's (Jon Peyton Price), although she would have preferred him to be named Albert after her late husband. Her 16-year-old granddaughter Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) finds out she is pregnant and Lou, Pauline and Kathy discuss Michelle's options, settling on an abortion, but if Michelle wanted the baby, she could stay with Kathy's sister Stephanie, though Michelle is furious with them deciding for her. Lou collapses in late 1985, prompting Dr Legg to send Lou into hospital for some tests and she is diagnosed with angina. The family have to make changes within the household to accommodate Lou's health problems, such as moving her bedroom downstairs, however, Lou doesn't take well to the changes. Dot, Ethel and Lou. Lou has a long- standing feud with Pat, having never forgiven her for having an affair with Kenny. Lou is plagued with mixed feelings when Kenny returns to London in 1988, after banishing him from their lives twenty years before. She has always had a difficult relationship with her son, feeling him to be \\"too big for the Square\\" and fears that Pat's revelation, that he is the true father of Pete's son Simon (Nick Berry), will tear her beloved family apart. Before his return to New Zealand, Lou manages to make amends with her estranged son, despite Pat's malicious stirring ‚Äì who later admits to Simon that Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield) is his real father after all. In her later years, Lou is plagued with ill-health. In July 1988, she returns from a holiday in her beloved Leigh-on-Sea feeling distinctly unwell. Fearing she is dying, she takes the opportunity to announce to her nearest and dearest exactly what she thinks of them, even managing to make a truce of sorts with nemesis Pat. After gathering her clan of Beales and Fowlers around her, she has a few choice words of wisdom and encouragement for each family member. The next morning, she is discovered dead in her bed by daughter Pauline, having died peacefully in her sleep the previous night. Her friends and family mourn her death affectionately, never quite managing to forget the irreplaceable \\"old bag\\". The youngest of seven siblings, Lou was from a large East End family herself. Only her sister Flo (Linda Robson) came to outlive her. In 1990, Harry Osborne (John Boswall) returns to Albert Square ‚Äì he had been engaged to Lou's sister, Doris, but she married Morris Miller after Harry was presumed dead in the war. In 1993, Lou's relative Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly) comes to stay with Pauline and Arthur. In 1997, it is discovered that Lou had given birth to another daughter, also fathered by Albert, who Lou had given up for adoption because she was conceived out of wedlock. Pauline, Ian and Mark travel to Ireland later that year to reunite with their long-lost family member, Maggie. In 2001, Mark names his stepdaughter Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox) after Lou. In 2015, Ian's grandson Louie Beale is also named after Lou. Character creation and development Background The creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, had always intended the programme to be primarily based around a large family \\"in old East-end tradition\\". By the 1980s, such families were on the decline in the East End. Natives had begun to emigrate out of East London to the wider area around Ilford, Romford, Chelmsford and Eastbourne. However, there were still some that refused to uproot and leave the area that had been home to many generations of their family. To construct the focal family, Holland and Smith were helped considerably by Tony Holland's recollections of his own East End background. Lou was the first EastEnders character to be created. She was based on Holland's aunt Lou Beale, one of four sisters from a large Walthamstow family.\\"EastEnders Secrets \\", Walford web. URL last accessed on 2007-03-18. Lou was mother to his cousins Peter and Pauline and married to Albert ‚Äì a family set-up that would eventually be recreated on-screen and would go on to be forever hailed as the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers. Peter Batt, who was one of the original scriptwriters of EastEnders, has stated that elements of Lou Beale were based on his mother. Lou's original character outline as written by series creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story:\\"A lively 70 year old. Archetypal East-end mother-earth figure. Fat, funny, sometimes loud, often openly sentimental. An obsessive view of family...she can be a stubborn cruel \\"old bag\\" when she wants to be, sometimes keeping \\"atmospheres\\" going for months. It was always Lou's house that was used for the big family celebrations. Especially Christmas. Twenty or more people crammed into a tiny house. Five sisters wedged into a minuscule kitchen; drinking gin and orange; wearing funny hats; all wearing aprons; laughing raucously and trying to cook a huge dinner at the same time. Lou's house was also the meeting place for the family Sunday teas. Ham, or tinned salmon salad. Bread and butter. Jelly and tinned cream. And, tea...the changing face of the area (especially the immigrants) is a constant source of fear to her, but then she doesn't go out much. She prefers to be at home, or on a trip down memory lane: day trips to Southend ‚Äì the Kursaal, Rossi's ice-cream and a plate of cockles; one wonderful week's holiday in a caravan in Clacton; fruit picking in Essex; Christmas; weddings; street parties...She has a soft spot for her son, Pete...\\" (page 51). Casting The actress Anna Wing, who was now 70 years old and had been acting since the late 1930s, auditioned for the role. She was so keen to play the part that she turned up for the audition clutching her birth certificate to prove she was a Hackney greengrocer's daughter and implored the producers to give her the job. When she first read for the part Holland and Smith felt that \\"she overacted terribly\\", but on the second reading she \\"brought the performance down considerably\\". There were initial fears over whether an actress of her age would have the stamina to survive EastEnders' gruelling schedule, but when asked if she'd like to be in a popular soap, Wing replied \\"All my life I've been an actress, now I want to be a household name!\\" Wing was set to appear in a stage play of Adrian Mole, which would have clashed with the filming of EastEnders. Julia Smith refused to offer her any leeway and informed her that she had to take a gamble ‚Äî she could either turn down the play, meaning that if she failed to get the part of Lou she would have lost two jobs, or she could give up the possibility of playing Lou and accept the play. Wing decided to turn down the play and she was subsequently given the role of Lou. An early choice in the casting process, Wing had the face, voice and attitude that Tony Holland had imagined for the character. She was told by producers to bring something from her own background to the role.\\"Anna Wing interview \\", Walford Gazette. URL last accessed on 2007-03-18. Narrative, impact and progression Lou's fierce demeanour made an impact from the opening episode, with one of the popular press in Britain (The Sun newspaper) running the headline \\"Enter the dragon... Lou Beale!\\" Lou was a frightening matriarch who domineered over both the Beale and Fowler families and most of her neighbours in Walford as well. The character did have a softer side, most often seen when interacting with her grandchildren. She was depicted as the linchpin of the Walford community and was often first to rally around her neighbours in times of trouble, or instruct various members of her clan to do so in her stead. She was a family orientated character, particularly opposed to change and determined to hold on to the ever-diminishing traditions of the East End. Most of her storylines were family based, which included various feuds, most notably with Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement), the ex-wife of her son who showed up in Walford in 1986. Various scandals and hardships were thrown at the character and her family, which she stoically battled through in order to keep the close-knit family that she presided over, together. The character was also used for comedy, most regularly with the other older characters, Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and she had a tendency to take to her bed and feign sickness if she didn't get her own way. Her relationship with son-in-law Arthur (Bill Treacher) was another on-going sub- plot often used for comical effect ‚Äî Lou portraying the stereotypical nagging mother-in-law and Arthur being the main protagonist for most of her displeasure, although they did share moments of closeness as well. However, in 1988 Anna Wing began to grow disillusioned with the direction the show was going in. She felt EastEnders did not fit in with her beliefs as a Quaker, commenting \\"We had 31 million viewers and it was shown all over the world, and I suddenly thought 'Should I be in this?'...I had a crisis of conscience.\\" After three years playing Lou, Anna Wing asked to be written out.\\"EastEnders' Lou reveals sexy past\\", Sunday Mirror. URL last accessed on 2007-03-18. Wing has since revealed that creator Julia Smith was devastated when she decided to leave, commenting \\"she said I could have been in it for ever and ever until I popped off for real.\\"\\"I STOPPED WATCHING ALBERT SQUARE.. NOW I LIKE EMMERDALE \\", Talk Walford. URL last accessed on 2007-03-18. The character was subsequently killed off, dying in her sleep in July 1988 after being frequently ill throughout the year. The character's final episodes were written by Tony Holland and directed by Julia Smith. Lou spent her final day arranging her affairs, seeing various members of her family, passing on advice and giving them presents and at the end of the episode she announced: \\"That's you lot sorted. I can go now.\\" At the start of episode 363, Lou was found to have died peacefully in her sleep. The episode then jumped a few days later to the day of her funeral ‚Äî an emotional episode, which featured Pete breaking down at Lou's graveside and ended with him proposing a toast in the Vic to absent friends and that \\"bloody old bag.\\" The episode was also notable for featuring, for the first time, a train crossing the railway viaduct in Bridge Street ‚Äî a special-effects shot commissioned especially for the occasion. The train was actually a ten-second illusion, produced by the BBC's electronic workshop. One EastEnders official commented: \\"It cost an arm and a leg, but old Lou was worth it.\\" Continuity regarding children Lou is a central character, who remains at the heart of the series during her time on screen and is later still occasionally referred to by long-running characters in a nostalgic nod back to the show's early history. There remains, however, a certain level of uncertainty and conflicting information regarding the character's background, in particular the number of offspring she supposedly produced. In the show's earliest episodes, Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and Pete Beale (Peter Dean) are the only two of Lou's offspring to feature on screen. Through character dialogue in episodes first shown in July 1985, the audience are told of the existence of four other children: Keith, Paul Norma and Shirley ‚Äî who were said to be living in Billericay, Romford and Eastbourne. As the series progressed, these were apparently forgotten in favour of other children and were not mentioned again. In the episode first shown on 28 October 1986, viewers are made aware of another child who lives in New Zealand, Kenny Beale. In addition, the character of Lou Beale also features heavily within a series of spin-off EastEnders novels by Hugh Miller, set prior to 1985 and published in 1986. Within the novelisations readers are introduced to further characters from Lou's history: sons Harry and Ronnie, a daughter Dora and siblings Elsie, Liz, Queenie and Terence. Kenny also features in the books. In the EastEnders novels, Harry, Dora and Ronnie have moved away from home when in their twenties and have lost contact with their mother. The Beales' fruit and veg stall on Bridge Street market is said to have passed to Ronnie after his father's death, and again passed to Pete when Ronnie moved away from Walford. Kenny appeared in EastEnders for a brief stint in episodes shown in February 1988, and is seen as a young child in the December 1988 spin-off CivvyStreet. Harry and Ronnie also appear in the spin- off episode, but do not appear in the television serial itself. In 1997, another of Lou's children is introduced: Maggie Flaherty (Olivia Shanley), her eldest child, who was given up for adoption as she was born out of wedlock. Other than the already established Pete, Pauline and Kenny, Maggie remains the only sibling to appear in the on-screen serial. In 2000, an EastEnders book was published entitled EastEnders Who's Who. The book pertains to the existence of Ronnie and yet another child, Maureen, who had both died. Harry and Dora are not mentioned in the book and neither Maureen nor Dora has been mentioned or seen on-screen, however, Pauline recounts the story of Arthur proposing to her on her unnamed sister's wedding day on multiple occasions.

He is a lawyer by profession, the President of the Wrestling Federation in the Rostov region, and Vice-President of the Russian Wrestling Federation. Samurgashev is an honorary citizen of Russia and Armenia. Career Samurgashev was born on 13 September 1979 in Rostov-on-Don in an Armenian family. His family had a sports background, his mother was part of the Rostov handball team that won the Russian national championships. He started practicing Greco-Roman wrestling at the age of 7 under the tutelage of Suren Kazarian, along with his three older brothers Rafael, Albert, and Simon. By the end of the 1990s, he was a member of the junior national team of Russia, and became the Junior European Champion in 1998 and the Junior World Champion in 1999. In 1998, he won his first of six senior Russian Championships and began to be compete for the Russian national team. After winning the 2000 European Wrestling Championships in Moscow, he competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In the course of the Olympic tournament, Samurgashev defeated the current Olympic champion W≈Çodzimierz Zawadzki (Poland), World and European champion Seref Eroglu (Turkey), World Cup winner Kevin Bracken (USA), and two-time European champion Akaki Chachua (Georgia). In the final, he defeated the current Olympic vice champion Juan Mar√©n (Cuba) and won the Olympic gold medal at the age of 20. He decided to move up a weight class after the Olympics. In 2002, in his new weight category, he won the silver medal at the 2002 European Championships and a gold medal at the 2002 World Wrestling Championships. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, he won three fights against opponents from Sweden, Ukraine, and Germany, but in the semifinals suddenly lost to a relatively less well-known opponent from Uzbekistan. Winning the match for third place against a Switzerland opponent, he won a bronze medal, but in the future called this result the most offensive failure in his athletic career, and explained it resulted from underestimating his opponent and premature mental orientation towards the final match. The following year, Samurgashev remained one of the top wrestlers in his division and became captain of Russia's national Greco-Roman wrestling team. He won his second World Championship gold medal at the 2005 World Wrestling Championships in Budapest and, the following year after that, won his second European Championship gold medal at the 2006 European Wrestling Championships in Moscow. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, he won his first two bouts against competitors from Denmark and Azerbaijan, but lost in the quarterfinals of the Hungarian P√©ter B√°csi. This match has been the subject of controversy thorough hearings, as the referee made the decision to award three points to Samurgashev, but after the intervention of the vice-president of FILA Mario Saletniga the decision was cancelled. The Russian side challenged the actions Saletniga were a violation of regulations. In 2009, Samurgashev won the Sports Arbitration Court case in Lausanne which found the handling incompetent, but had not revised the result. Samurgashev planned to fully carry out and the next Olympics, but in June 2009 at the Russian Championships in Krasnodar, while executing an overrun he received a double fracture of the jaw with displacement and was hospitalized in intensive care. Later he was able to recover from this injury, but he was unable to compete at his previous level. In September 2012, he officially announced the completion of his sports career. After wrestling In September 2012, Varteres Samurgashev headed the Wrestling Federation of Rostov. In September 2013 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Rostov region. He became the Vice-President of the Russian Wrestling Federation in November 2016. Personal life Varteres has an older brother, Rafael Samurgashev (born 1963), who was a member of the Armenian national Greco-Roman wrestling team at the 2000 Summer Olympics and is now the vice president of the Russian Wrestling Federation.

It is usually performed by a forensic electrical engineer. It The technique relies on the assumption that, when heat from fire (or from hot gases caused by the fire) impinges on an electrical line (whether or not protected by a conduit), it will melt the wire insulation and cause an electrical fault at the first point that it reaches on the electrical line. For this to occur, the electrical line must be energized at the time that fire hits it. Origin of fire Arc mapping often aims to determine the point of origin of the fire. A common assumption used in reaching this goal is that the fire expands uniformly in all directions as it burns, and maintains a circular shape centered on the point of origin; therefore, when an electrical fault occurs on an electrical line, the point of origin is on a perpendicular to that point. Contrary to this assumption, however, in many cases fire does not extend uniformly; in particular, large local fuel loads, venting, and air currents have a strong effect on fire progression. Several other factors affect the locations where electrical faults occur. Electrical faults do not always occur where fire first reaches a conduit, but preferentially occur at bends in a conduit or at locations where wires are pressed together. The elevation of an electrical line has a strong effect on its exposure to heat, since temperatures in a fire are generally highest near ceiling level, except in the immediate vicinity of the point of origin. Protection from the fire is an important consideration: being located within a wall or being covered in fiberglass insulation will offer some protection to an electrical line, and will delay electrical faults. Electrical faults An electrical fault will only occur if an electrical line is energized - more specifically, if two conductors are at different potentials, and have the capacity to source/sink significant current. An electrical arcing event will often (though not always) cause a loss of power downstream on the electrical line, such as by severing the conductors or tripping a circuit breaker; as a result, a significant part of arc-map analysis is determining the order in which sections of electrical lines lost power. In most cases, the electrical faults that occurred furthest downstream occurred first. Electrical faults can also energize conductors or components that are not normally energized, such as conduits (normally grounded). (\\"Energized\\" usually refers to a conductor being connected to hot power, as opposed to neutral. More generally, electrical faults occur between points at different potentials, such as between hot and neutral, between hot and ground, or between hots of two different phases.) Electrical arcing Investigators distinguish between electrical arcing and copper that melted due to the high temperatures of the fire. The term \\"electrical arcing\\", in fire investigation, often refers to \\"melted copper that indicates that electrical arcing occurred\\". \\"Melted copper\\" generally refers not to copper that is currently melted, but to \\"previously melted, resolidified copper\\". NFPA 921 and Kirk's Fire Investigation give some guidelines and illustrations on distinguishing between electrical arcing and other melted copper; however, these strict guidelines occasion much debate.

The model is managed and maintained by an independent company, VantageScore Solutions, LLC, that was formed in 2006 and is jointly owned by the three bureaus. VantageScore models compete with the credit scoring models produced by Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO). Like the models developed by FICO, VantageScore models operate on data stored in the consumer credit files maintained by the three national credit bureaus. VantageScore models and FICO models use statistical analysis on those data to predict the likelihood a consumer will default on a loan. VantageScore and FICO models represent risk of loan default in the form of three-digit scores, with higher scores indicating lower risk. VantageScore and FICO use different, proprietary analytical methods, and scores from one system cannot be translated into one from the other. VantageScore vs FICO score VantageScore and FICO are developers of competing credit scoring models. FICO, the original creator of the FICO Score, was not involved with the creation of VantageScore's formula. VantageScore, FICO and the credit bureaus have allowed the public to know some information about the credit score categories and the corresponding calculation weights. FICO allows consumers to get their generic or classic FICO score for Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax through the myFICO website. Consumers can get their VantageScores from free credit report websites, and TransUnion and Experian offer VantageScores to consumers for a fee through their websites. In contrast with FICO's credit scoring models, which are custom-built for each of the three national credit bureaus, to accommodate structural differences in the bureaus' databases, VantageScore model design allows a single model to operate on all three bureaus' data. VantageScore Solutions holds several patents on processes that ensure pieces of data within each bureau's consumer database will be treated identically, regardless of differences in database structure. These methods eliminate much, but not all, discrepancy in VantageScore scores obtained at the same time from different credit bureaus. Some variation is unavoidable because factors such as the timing of lenders' payment-information reports can mean the contents of a given consumer's credit file will differ somewhat at each of the three credit bureaus. The first two VantageScore models (VantageScore 1.0, issued in 2006, and VantageScore 2.0, released in 2010) used a scale range of 501 to 990, and assigned letter grades to various bands within that range, according to TransUnion: :A: 900‚Äì990 :B: 800‚Äì899 :C: 700‚Äì799 :D: 600‚Äì699 :F: 501‚Äì599 VantageScore 3.0, the version of the model released in 2013, adopted a scale of 300 to 850. VantageScore attributed the change, which matches the scale range used by FICO models, to the fact that consumers were more familiar with it than with the original VantageScore range, and because a 300-850 scale would make it easier for lenders to incorporate the VantageScore into automated systems. VantageScore 4.0 was released in mid-2017, and contains many updates from 3.0. For example, version 4.0 weights medical accounts reported \\"in collection\\" less heavily than non- medical collection accounts. Paid collection accounts of any type are not factored into the score; this is a major difference from FICO, since most versions of FICO count any collection account into the score, paid or unpaid. VantageScore 4.0 also looks at trended data provided by the credit bureau from which the score is calculated, and examines a consumer's credit utilization rates over time. This is a major development in credit scores since other models to date (including older versions of VantageScore and all existing versions of FICO) only examine the most recently reported billing cycle. So, for example, if a consumer's credit card often reports at or near the credit limit, but the consumer paid his/her balance recently and it now reflects a $0 balance, most credit scores would look only at the current $0 balance when calculating utilization rates. However, the makers of VantageScore 4.0 believe it is more accurate to look at the consumer's utilization rates over a period of time. This may help or hurt a consumer, depending on their situation. A consumer who has historically used very little of their credit but makes a large one-time purchase and shows a high balance at the time the score is calculated would score better under VantageScore 4.0 than, say, FICO 8, which looks only at the most current billing cycle information.

It is located within the municipality of Lom in Innlandet county and in the Jotunheimen mountain area. It is situated on the absolute eastern flank of Jotunheimen between the Veodalen and Sjodalen Valleys and is the southernmost and highest summit on a rather long ridge containing six more 2,000-m peaks. The summit can be observed along parts of National Route 51 from B√•tskaret in the south to Hinds√¶ter in the north. From the south it is an almost perfect cone, and with fresh snow covering the peak, it is a sight admired by many tourists. The summit is easily climbed from Sjodalen valley either from Hinds√¶ter Mountain Lodge, which is the longer route, or from the Russa/Sjoa confluence. Both ways the route will start in low birch forest and gradually enter long talus slopes and plains with many snow patches in the summer. In the winter, the summit is easily reached, but one should be very wary about the proximity of the northern wall, falling 500 m into Nautgarden. From Hinds√¶ter the rest of the summits in the massif is also reached on a rather long day hike. The views are enormous. There are no peaks in southern and eastern direction reaching higher than 1,850 metres, and you see almost all of the eastern Oppland highlands. Theoretically you can see the hills north of Oslo, but it might be difficult to discern them. Sn√∏hetta, the Rondane mountain range and all the mountains of Valdres, like Bitihorn can be seen from this summit. To the west many of the summits in Jotunheimen can be admired - most prominent among them from this vantage point - Glittertind, the distant neighbor to the northwest Nautgardstind lies within Jotunheimen National Park, established 1980. The name The first element is the name of the valley Nautgarden (also called Stornautgarden 'the big Nautgarden'), the last element is the finite form of tind m 'mountain peak'. The name of the valley is the finite form of nautgard m 'fencing for neat, cattle'). A smaller valley, three kilometer east, is called Veslnautgarden 'the small Nautgarden' - and two small sidevalleys of Stornautgarden is named B√•sen, the finite form of b√•s, 'stall'.

He was born in the village of Kellaki, Limassol District and received his secondary education at the American Academy of Larnaca with financial help from his brother. In his last year of school because of health reasons he moved to Nicosia where he finished his studies in The English School, Nicosia. He then worked as a miner in Skouriotissa (Foukasa) and as a manual worker in Piraeus port. He moved to London in the early 1930s where he actively worked with the Communist Party of Great Britain against different fascist factions. During this time he was arrested and jailed for three months by the British authorities. During his time in Britain he became a founding member of the Association of Cypriot Affairs which sought the expulsion of the British from Cyprus. In 1936, he was part of a contingent of 60 Cypriot leftists who volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War as part of the International Brigades. 15 of them died and Ezekias was injured and had to return to London. Cyprus had the biggest percentage of volunteers and dead per capita of any country fighting against Francisco Franco. After the war he lived in London and worked as a milkman. With the start of World War II Ezekias tried to enlist but he was refused because of his old injuries and a poor health. Not able to remain idle he joined the London air defence where he served until the end of the war. In 1945 he was asked by AKEL to return to Cyprus where he remained until the end of his life. After his return, he immediately got involved in local politics and in 1946 he became Editor-in-chief of the newspaper \\"Democratis\\" and in 1949 3rd General Secretary of the Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL), a position he held for 40 years until his death. During the next few years he worked endlessly along with his party for the rights of workers and against British colonialism. The party was declared illegal by the British authorities in 1955 and Ezekias together with another 134 members were arrested and jailed. Soon after Ezekias escaped and continued the fight until Independence in 1959. Ezekias was against the Z√ºrich and London Agreement, claiming it was unworkable. He worked for the next two decades to prevent all tactics of the extreme right wing elements of the island and to foster better relations with the Turkish Cypriots. In 1960, following the independence of Cyprus from the British Empire, he was elected to parliament. Papaioannou was repeatedly re-elected and served as a member of Parliament for 28 consecutive years up until his death in 1988. In his will, he left all his assets to his party.

The company produces approximately 80 percent of the canned baked beans consumed in the United States, representing estimated annual sales in excess of $400 million and the processing of more than 55 million pounds of beans per year. In addition, the company also offers other canned beans (black, garbanzo, pinto, and refried), as well as peas, hominy, and cut green beans. Based in Knoxville, Tennessee, Bush Brothers operates plants in Augusta, Wisconsin and Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. Its canned goods are sold through retail food outlets and food service operators throughout the United States and Canada. History In 1904, A. J. (Andrew Jackson) Bush partnered with the Stokely family to open a tomato cannery in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. His cannery proved so profitable that, by 1908, he was able to buy out the Stokelys' interest and establish his own independent business. He entered into partnership with his two oldest sons, Fred and Claude, and established Bush Brothers & Company.Metz 2011, p. 29. Incorporation and expansion (1922‚Äì1935) Bush cannery, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee In 1922, A.J. Bush took out a $945 loan on his life insurance policy and used his bank line of credit to incorporate his business. Bush Brothers & Company was incorporated in June 1922, and Fred Bush (A.J.'s oldest son) was named president. (Fred was also a Director of the National Canners Association, the primary industry trade group for canning companies.)Metz 2011, p. 54. The company's canning operations originally began with laborious, manual processes, then expanded with steam powered engines, and eventually evolved into electric-powered factory machinery.Metz 2011, p. 81. During the 1920s, Bush Brothers & Company began expanding its operations to include products other than tomatoes. The company constructed a small canning factory in Clinton, Tennessee in 1923, and began canning both tomatoes and peaches in 1924.Metz 2011, p. 56. The year 1928 saw the company's expansion into corn and hominy, as well as the lease of the Smith Brothers & Company's Oak Grove corn processing plant just outside Dandridge, Tennessee.Metz 2011, p. 73. And in 1930, Bush Brothers opened a new plant in LaFollette, Tennessee, where it processed blueberries in addition to tomatoes.Metz 2011, p. 83. As the company continued to grow, the original cannery in Chestnut Hill became insufficient to meet its needs. Bush Brothers constructed a new building nearby in 1929, which would become the company's main canning facilities for many years.Metz 2011, p. 76. In 1933, Bush Brothers began offering pork and beans, canned under its Chestnut Hill label. The success of their product led to a contract with Armour and Company and to a wide array of canned meats. The company also started up a canning line for Tony Dog and Cat Food, which it would continue to sell until the 1980s.Metz 2011, p. 93. By 1935, Bush Brothers were seeing significant expansion and were highlighted in newspaper articles for canning ten million cans of vegetables a year, operating two-thousand acres of company owned farmland, and contracting with five-hundred farmers to supply vegetables. Properties lost to Tennessee Valley Authority (1942‚Äì1948) In 1942, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced the closing of the Douglas Dam floodgates within the year. The end result would be the flooding of the French Broad River bottom, where Bush Brothers had a number of farms. After several months of negotiation, Bush Brothers & Company agreed to sell seven prime tracts of their farmland to the TVA, as well as the Oak Grove Canning Plant.Metz 2011, p. 107. In October 1944, Bush Brothers attempted to offset some of their farmland loss by purchasing the Blytheville Canning Company in Arkansas. However, the plant was in bad shape and struggled during its first four years of Bush ownership. Claude Bush moved to Arkansas in 1948 to oversee the facilities and eventually managed to turn it into a profitable business.Metz 2011, p. 111. Expansion and change (1946‚Äì1965) Following A.J. Bush's death in 1946, Bush Brothers & Company made the move from private label to branded presence. They began offering their goods under the newly developed Bush's Best logo and label. With the advents of supermarkets and television advertising, the 1950s proved very profitable for the company. During this time, they continued to offer a variety of canned vegetables, particularly green beans.Metz 2011, p. 124. They also began offering the dry bean products for which they would eventually become known. In 1952, the company introduced their Great Northern Beans with Plain Sauce. This was followed in 1953 by Mexican Style Beans in Chili Gravy.Metz 2011, p. 143. Claude Bush became president of the company in 1959, following the death of his older brother Fred. Bush Brothers & Company had amassed a substantial amount of cash and accounts receivable under Fred, and Claude felt the money would best be put to use expanding the company's business into new areas.Metz 2011, p. 165. The 1960s saw the purchase of several canning plants, including Shiocton Kraut Company (Shiocton, Wisconsin), Hyde Park Canning Company (Muskogee, Oklahoma), an unused canning plant in Augusta, Wisconsin, and Valley Canning Sweet Potato plants in Ville Platte and Cecilia, Louisiana.Metz 2011, p. 166. Bush Brothers & Company also created its own truck line, Tennessee Truck Lines, in 1962.Metz 2011, p. 189. In 1965, Claude became Chairman of the Board, and brother-in-law C.J. Ethier succeeded him as President.Metz 2011, p. 191. Bush's Best Baked Beans (1969‚Äì1978) The year 1969 proved to be a tough one for the canning industry due to overproduction and low prices. As the family stockholders considered their options and discussed strategies for riding out the tough times ahead, Claude's son Condon Bush hit on the idea of offering a new product that would appeal to a wide audience as well as keep his Augusta plant busy during the off season. Inspired by the company's earlier success with pork and beans, Condon decided to develop a baked bean product based on his mother Kathleen's secret recipe. The experiment proved far more successful than the Bush family had ever imagined. Sales of Bush's Best Baked Beans went from ten thousand cases in 1969 to a hundred thousand in 1970, eventually hitting close to a million cases in 1971.Metz 2011, p. 211. Baked beans became a very popular dish during the United States Bicentennial, and so Bush Brothers decided to devote all of their resources to Bush's Best Baked Beans sales. Their campaign was a success, with sales increasing by 173% in 1976, and an additional 34% in 1977.Metz 2011, p. 233. In 1978, Claude stepped down as Chairman of the Board, and C.J. Ethier replaced him. Condon was elected as the new President of Bush Brothers & Company.Metz 2011, p. 239. Acquisition of Dubon (1979‚Äì1993) In 1979, Bush Brothers acquired the Dubon brand of canned foods when that company was sold, following bankruptcy. Canned vegetables, such as carrots, peas, and beets are sold primarily in the Louisiana and New Orleans areas as a regional brand.Metz 2011, p. 252. Throughout the 1980s, Bush Brothers continued to make its transition to a branded producer of table-ready products. However, the shift was slow and fraught with tension as the family had trouble agreeing on the best course of action. After the death of C.J. Ethier in 1989 and Claude Bush in 1990, Jim Ethier (C.J.'s son) convinced Condon (President and CEO) and Allen Bush (Vice President of Sales) to consult with Dr. Leon Danco of the Center for Family Business. Under Dr. Danco's guidance, Bush Brothers & Company reorganized its Board of Directors to include members from outside the family and the company.Metz 2011, p. 281. The restructured Board included Jay Carr (The Hershey Company), Bob Johnston (Gerber Products Company), Bill Trubeck (White & Case), and Clay Mathile (The Iams Company).Metz 2011, p. 285. With the new Board in place, the company turned to the task of hiring professional sales managers. Office space in Chestnut Hill was filled to capacity, and the prospect of recruiting young, urban managers to such a rural location seemed unlikely. In 1991, Bush Brothers & Company moved its company headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee.Metz 2011, p. 286. In 1992, Jim Ethier was elected President and COO of Bush Brothers & Company. Condon Bush moved to the position of CEO and Chairman of the Board.Metz 2011, p. 280. The restructured and reorganized company developed an overarching strategy in 1993. According to Jim Ethier: > The first strategic plan defined the process that would enable us to get out > of products where we were losing money, as well as away from business > processes that no longer made sense. It was a defining step in the \\"re- > architecting\\" of the company.Metz 2011, p. 293. Among other things, this plan involved consolidating the company's subsidiaries into a single entity and team, narrowing the company's focus to its most successful products, and placing a new emphasis on customers satisfaction through a Primary Excellence Goal (PEG) organization.Metz 2011, p. 299. Jay Bush (and Duke) (1993‚Äìpresent) In 1993, Bush Brothers & Company hired a small advertising company in Atlanta, Georgia called Cole, Henderson, Drake (CHD) to develop a new advertising campaign for their line of baked beans. The new ad focused on the \\"secret family recipe\\", and introduced Jay Bush (Condon's son) as the company's spokesperson. The ad performed well in test markets in 1993, and was released nationally in May 1994. In the summer 1995, a new ad paired Jay up with a mischievous, talking golden retriever named Duke. Modeled after Bush's real-life pet golden retriever of the same name at the time (the dog itself experienced stage fright and was not properly camera-trained), the campaign was created by CHD copywriter David Garzotto and was a huge hit for Bush Brothers, who saw a dramatic spike in baked bean sales.Metz 2011, pp. 301-302. The popularity of the company's baked beans can be directly attributed to the success of the Jay Bush and Duke commercials; as well as its catchphrase \\"Roll that beautiful bean footage!\\" to market their products, which are made according to the secret family recipe with specially cured bacon, brown sugar, and a secret blend of spices. All the while, Jay is able to keep Duke from selling the secret family recipe, another running gag in the ads. As a result of the ad campaign, the duo became celebrities, and sales of the company's beans increased from a 48% national market share to 80%. The popularity of the commercial inspired the company to publish a children's book, Duke Finds a Home, published in 2006. In 2012, comedian Julie Klausner tweeted a suggestion that Bush Brothers offer a poetry contest, allowing the winner to pet Duke, who she had seen in a television commercial. The request was reiterated by numerous individuals on various social media sites and inspired an informal online petition to the company. On June 27, 2018, Sam, one of the dogs who played Duke on screen, was put to sleep after being diagnosed with cancer. The role had already been recast several years before his death. US President Barack Obama as well as influencer and esteemed songwriter Ray William Johnson both made public statements mourning Sam. Recent years Bush Visitor Center, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee The new Bush Visitor Center is an expansion from founder A.J. Bush's original General Store in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee, and includes a museum, retail shop and caf√©. It also houses the guarded display of the \\"Bush's Secret Family Recipe\\" book.

The landing of troops directly from ships was extremely risky; however it was hoped that either the French defenders would be taken entirely by surprise, or that they would actually co-operate with the landing forces. Two sloops, and were used to landing the troops. The Operation The landing ships came under sustained fire from the defenders once they were inside the harbour boom including four shore batteries (from east to west ‚Äì Mole Ravin Blanc, Mole Miller and, Mole J.

Of the 393 American infantrymen of the 3rd Battalion, 6th Armored Infantry Regiment, 189 were killed and 157 wounded. The Royal Navy suffered 113 dead and 86 wounded and a small US Navy team assigned as anti-sabotage five killed and seven wounded.Atkinson, p.76 Walney made it alongside the jetty and succeeded in landing a small number of men.

The life's story of Guru Gobind Singh is further told by the court- poet Sainapat, who is also believed to have translated the Chanakya Niti at the Guru's behest. Sainapat finished his Sri Gur Sobha in AD 1711, three years after the death of the Guru. Other early sources are Koer Singh's Gurbilas Patshahi, written in 1751 and the Bansawalinamah by Kesar Singh Chhibbar (1767).

It has about 4,200 inhabitants. It lies on the Olza River, near the border with Poland, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. Near the Olza's right bank lies a complex of 15 ponds. Etymology The name is patronymic in origin derived from German personal name Dietmar. First mentioned (ca. 1305) in Latin form Dithmari villa, later as Dytmarsdorff (1392), Dietmarsdorf (1430), Dieczmarowicz[e] (1438, 1447), Dieczmiorowice (1652), Dittmersdorf P. Dieczmorowitz (1736), Dittmansdorf, pohlnisch Dietmarowicze (1804), Dittmannsdorf, Dƒõtmarovice, Dzieƒámarowice (1900). History The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Dithmari villa sunt triginta octo mansi.Hos√°k et al. 1980, 405.< It meant that the village had 38 smaller lans. The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Ditmari villa. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1573 it was sold as one of a dozen villages and the town of Freistadt and formed a state country split from the Duchy of Teschen. The village was bought in 1792 by Jan Larisch who joined it with its Karwin properties. It was owned by the Larisch family until 1927. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed in 1869 to the newly established Freistadt political district and Oderberg legal district, but before 1890 the municipality was transferred to Freistadt legal district. A formerly separate village of Koukoln√° became administratively a part of Dƒõtmarovice in 1872-1875. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1,769 in 1880 to 3,453 in 1910. In three censuses majority were Czech-speakers (84.9% in 1880, 64% in 1890, 77.1% in 1910, 12.5% minority in 1900), in 1900 majority were Polish-speakers (86.7%, in other censuses minority: 13.9% in 1880, 34.6% in 1890, 21.8% in 1910). They were accompanied by German-speaking minority (between 0.8% and 1.4%). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (98.2%), followed by Jews (31 or 0.9%), Protestants (19 or 0.6%) and others (15 or 0.3%). The Dittmannsdorf post-office (in Austrian Silesia) was opened in 1895.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen- Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

It is located about 18 km from Sikar in a north direction. Description Palthana was founded by Palaram Jat of Burdak gotra in 1480. Burdaks had come in 5 carts from village Kari near Nawalgarh in Shekhawati region in Rajasthan. One cart of Palaram Burdak stayed here where Sarans were cultivating in this village. Palaram Burdak wanted to occupy this village. Sarans resisted it. There was a struggle in which Sarans were defeated and the village land was occupied by Palaram Burdak. He founded the village and was called Palthana after Palaram. There is an old building in the village built by Palaram, the founder, about 500 years back. The population of the village is about 3000 out of which 1500 people are Jats. They are all of Burdak gotra. There is one family of Meel gotra. Palthana was the centre of Sekhawati farmers' movement before independence. It is well developed village with modern facilities like good road connectivity, watercoolers in the centre of village to give relief to people  Shekhawati farmers' movement  The Palthana village has special importance in the movement of freedom and awakening of the farmers of Shekhawati. This was the place where it was decided to conduct Jat Prajapati Maha-Yagya, which proved a turning point for Shekhawati farmers' movement. This was the place where the terror of Jagirdars first time came to an end. In this very village the jagirdars destroyed the school opened by Hari Singh Burdak and arrested master Chandra Bhan Singh.Dr Pema Ram, Kisan Andolan Ka Itihas (‡§∂‡•á‡§ñ‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§® ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§á‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏), 1990, Publisher - Sri Ganesh Sewa Samiti, Jasnagar, District Nagaur - 341518, p. 86 After successful Jhunjhunu adhiveshan in 1932, a deputation of Jats from Sikar district, under the leadership of Prithvi Singh Gothra met Thakur Deshraj and requested him to do a similar adhiveshan in Sikar also. After long discussions Thakur Deshraj proposed to have a yagya at Sikar. A meeting for discussing this issue was called in Palthana village in October 1933. This was attended by all activists from Shekhawati and one member was invited from each family in Sikar district. About 5000 people gathered in the meeting. The Sikar thikana wanted to make this meeting a failure. For this, the thikanedar sent hundreds of handcuffs loaded on camels along with the police force to terrorize the people taking part in the meeting.Dr Pema Ram & Dr Vikramaditya Chaudhary, Jaton ki Gauravgatha (‡§ú‡§æ‡§ü‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•å‡§∞‡§µ‡§ó‡§æ‡§•‡§æ), 2004, Publisher - Rajasthani Granthagar, Jodhpur, p. 145 Thakur Deshraj addressed the people that :\\"these handcuffs would get you independence.

People listened the leaders very calmly and meeting was a great success. Police could do nothing. The leaders who attended the meeting were Sardar Harlal Singh, Chaudhary Ram Singh Kunwarpura, Chaudhary Ghasi Ram, Kunwar Net Ram Singh, Kunwar Panne Singh of Devroad's elder brother Bhoor Singh and many more. There was a speech by Master Ratan Singh Pilani. A resolution was passed in this meeting to conduct a seven-day \\"Jat Prajapat Mahayagya\\" (Prayer ceremony for the Lord of Universe) in Sikar on next basant in 1934, to spread the principles of Arya Samaj and create awakening in Shekhawati. It was decided for this purpose to collect ghee and money from each household. A yagya committee was formed consisting of Chaudhary Hari Singh Burdak of Palthana village as its president, Master Chandrabhan Singh as minister. Deva Singh Bochalya, Thakur Hukum Sing and Bhola Singh were made in charge of publicity. The office of managing committee was earlier in Palthana. In December 1933 this office was transferred to Sikar. The Jat Prajapati Maha-Yagya took place at Sikar from 20‚Äì29 January 1934. Kunwar Hukam Singh Rahees Angai (Mathura) was made Yagyapati or Chairman of the Yagya. Chaudhary Kaluram of village Kudan was the Yagyaman. Acharya Shri Jagdev Sidhanthi received an invitation for this Yagya at his Gurukul at Kirttal, In that invitation was he requested to attend the Yagya and bring twenty Bhramcharis and disciples with him. Volunteers went to all the households in all the villages in the region and collected material that would be needed. They collected Ghee, Flour, Gur, and invited all the householders to participate. Hundreds of cans of Ghee and hundreds of sacks of flour were collected. During the Yagya 3000 men and women adopted the Yogyopavit, which was a symbol Kisan sangathan. Sheetal Kumari daughter of Kunwar Netram Singh adopted yagyopavit. Chaudhary Chimana Ram of Sangasi brought his wife wearing salwar-kurta. The unity of Jat farmers in this Yagya had terrified the Jagirdars of Sikar. The role played by Sardar Har Lal Singh and Thakur Deshraj was unparallel which made this yagya a grand success.  Sikarwati Jat kisan Panchayat  The Jat Prajapati Mahayagya of Sikar was attended by about a lakh farmers and was a grand success in awakening of the farmers of Shekhawati. This annoyed the Rao Raja of Sikar and his other thikanedars. Jats had still one grievance that they were not able to take the procession of sabhapati of yagya on elephant as planned because the Rao Raja of Sikar had helped in getting the elephant run away. Immediately after the yagya Jat leaders held a meeting under the chairmanship of Thakur Deshraj to settle the issues with Rao Raja Sikar and his thikanedars. They founded a body called \\"Sikarwati Jat Kisan Panchayat\\". Thakur Deva Singh Bochalya was elected General Secretary and Hari Singh Burdak as sarpanch of this body.Dr Pema Ram, Kisan Andolan Ka Itihas (‡§∂‡•á‡§ñ‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§® ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§á‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏), 1990, Publisher - Sri Ganesh Sewa Samiti, Jasnagar, District Nagaur - 341518, p. 90 During those days a folk song was very popular amongst the women of Shekhawati which is as under in Rajasthani language: :‡§ö‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§∏‡§ñ‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ç‡§Å, ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡•§ :‡§§‡•ã‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§∞‡§™‡§Ç‡§ö ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å ‡§™‡§≤‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡•§‡•§Dr Pema Ram, Kisan Andolan Ka Itihas (‡§∂‡•á‡§ñ‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§® ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§á‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏), 1990, Publisher - Sri Ganesh Sewa Samiti, Jasnagar, District Nagaur - 341518, p. 85 External links *Villages in the Sikar tehsil, Sikar district, Rajasthan References Category:Villages in Sikar district ","title":"Palthana"},{"id":"4478060","text":"Charles Hudspeth (a.k.a.

It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna, Austria. History The series of Jupiter's Loves was conceived after the success of Venus and Cupid with a Satyr. Correggio painted four canvasses in total, although others had been programmed perhaps. In the first edition of his Lives, late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari mentions only two of the paintings, Leda and the Swan (today at the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin) and one Venus (presumably the Danae currently in the Borghese Gallery of Rome), although he knew them only from descriptions provided by Giulio Romano. Vasari mentions that the commissioner, duke Federico Gonzaga II, wanted to donate the works to emperor and King of Spain Charles V: that the other two works, Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle and Jupiter and Io, were in Spain during the 16th century implies that they were part of the same series. British art historian Cecil Gould suggested that Federico had commissioned the Io and Ganymede for himself, and that they were ceded to Charles V only after the duke's death in 1540, perhaps on occasion of the marriage of the king's son, Philip; other hypothesized that Federico ordered them for the Ovid room in his Palazzo Te. The canvas was in Vienna since as early as the 1610s, when it is mentioned in the Habsburg imperial collections together with Ganymede. Description The scene of Jupiter and Io is inspired by Ovid's classic Metamorphoses. Io, daughter of Inachus, the first king of Argos, is seduced by Jupiter (Zeus in Greek), who hides behind the dunes to avoid hurting the jealous Juno (Hera in Greek). Jupiter was often tempted by other women and took on various disguises in order to cover his various escapades, one time taking the form of a swan, another time of an eagle, and in this painting he is not becoming something else so much as enveloping himself in a dark cloud, even though it is bright daylight. He is embracing the nymph, his face barely visible above hers. She is pulling Jupiter's vague, smoky hand towards herself with barely contained sensuality; this is a sensual painting, depicting one of the many loves of the god. Indeed, the Duke of Mantua, Federico Gonzaga, wanted to place the painting and its companion pieces in a room dedicated to the loves of Jupiter. Noteworthy is the contrast between the evanescent figure of the immaterial Jupiter, and the sensual substance of Io's body, shown lost in an erotic rapture which anticipates the works of Bernini and Rubens.

Born at Campbellfield north of Melbourne, he started work in New South Wales as a cadet surveyor and in 1893 joined the Western Australian Department of Lands and Survey. In 1901 a royal commission resulted in Canning being commissioned to survey a route for a barrier fence across the State. Construction of the fence, known as the No. 1 Rabbit Proof Fence was completed in 1907. When completed it was the longest line of unbroken fence in the world. Canning is best known for surveying a stock route for bringing cattle 1500 km overland from the Kimberley district to the goldfields in 1906 and 1907. He returned the following year to commence construction of 51 wells which were set one days march (20 km) apart to feed travelling livestock. The route was completed in 1910 and runs from Halls Creek to Wiluna. Canning received a hero's welcome on his return to Perth, however his cook Edward Blake alleged the party had ill-treated Aboriginals, coerced Aboriginal men to locate water by force feeding them salt, destroyed water holes and kidnapped Aboriginal women for sex.WA Museum After Premier Newton Moore failed to act on his claims Blake took them to the newspapers which prompted Moore to call a Royal Commission. > \\"It was necessary at times to use chains on our guides but we padded them to > make sure they did not chafe the men's necks...they were happy with the > arrangement.\\" > --Evidence given before the Royal Commission by surveyor Hubert Trotman The Commissioner of police admitted that police were forced to chain the guides due to their unwillingness to join the expedition.

In the summer, cricket was played, while in the winter, rugby was the designated activity. The team currently plays in Temple Hill, Ballintemple. Due to the introduction of professional rugby union, and its success at producing players who go on to obtain Munster contracts, Con, like many other senior rugby clubs in Ireland, has been unable to field a full strength side for a number of years. In this period though, Con have remained competitive, reaching the final of the All- Ireland League on six occasions since 2001 inclusive; losing in 2001 to Dungannon, losing in 2002 to Shannon, again losing in 2004 to Shannon and losing in 2007 to Garryowen, winning the elusive third title in 2008 on beating Garryowen in Musgrave Park and capturing a fourth title when beating St. Mary's by 17 points to 10 after extra time in Dubarry Park in May 2010.

He is the Halls-Bascom Professor of Classics Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, author of the widely used textbook Classical Myth and many other books. Trained at Berkeley and Harvard, he is a specialist in Homer and in the history of writing. He has also taught Egyptian philology for many years and courses in Egyptian civilization. Work His Writing: Theory and History of the Technology of Civilization (Wiley-Blackwell 2009) attempts to create a scientific terminology and taxonomy for the study of writing, and was described in Science as \\"stimulating and impressive\\" and \\"a worthy successor to the pioneering book by Semitic specialist I. J. Gelb.\\"A. Robinson, \\"Signs of Meaning\\", Science 324, pp. 38‚Äì39 (3 April 2009) This book has been translated into Arabic and modern Greek. Powell's study Homer and the Origin of the Greek Alphabet advances the thesis that a single man invented the Greek alphabet expressly in order to record the poems of Homer.\\"When the Ancient Greeks Began to Write\\", Archaeology, pp. 44‚Äì49 (May/June 2017) This thesis is controversial. The book was the subject of an international conference in Berlin in 2002 and has been influential outside classical philology, especially in media studies. Powell's Writing and the Origins of Greek Literature follows up themes broached by the thesis. Powell's textbook, Classical Myth (8th edition) is widely used for classical myth courses in America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan, as his text The Greeks: History, Culture, Society (with Ian Morris) is widely used in ancient history classes. His text World Myth is popular in such courses. Powell's critical study Homer is widely read as an introduction for philologists, historians, and students of literature. In this study, Powell suggested that Homer may have hailed from Euboea instead of Ionia.Barry B. Powell, Homer, Wiley- Blackwell, 2004, p. 30: \\"Although most handbooks call Homer an Ionian poet, who lived and worked in Asia Minor, he may have worked on the long island of Euboea that hugs the east coast of mainland Greece. Certain technical features of his dialect may mark it as West Ionian, as opposed to the East Ionian of the Asia Minor coast.\\" A New Companion to Homer (with Ian Morris), also translated into modern Greek and Chinese, is a comprehensive review of modern scholarship on Homer. His literary works include poetry (Rooms Containing Falcons), an autobiography (Ramses in Nighttown), a mock-epic (The War at Troy: A True History), an academic novel (A Land of Slaves: A Novel of the American Academy), a novel about Berkeley (The Berkeley Plan: A Novel of the Sixties), a novel about Jazz (Take Five, with Sanford Dorbin), and a collection of short fiction. He has published a memoir: Ramses Reborn. In Tales of the Trojan War he retells in a droll, sometimes ribald style, the stories attached to the Trojan cycle, based on ancient sources. He has translated the IliadReview by Hayden Pelliccia, \\"As Many Homers as you Please\\", New York Review of Books (20 November 2017) and the Odyssey. The introduction to these poems discusses Powell's thesis about the Greek alphabet and the recording of Homer and is an influential review of modern Homeric criticism. He has also translated the Aeneid and the poems of Hesiod.

Richards was an All-American lineman at the University of Nebraska from 1927 to 1929, then joined the NFL's Frankford Yellow Jackets in 1930. During his playing days, he became known for a notorious move that has since been outlawed: the \\"lift\\", in which Richards used his elbow to hit the opposing center as he snapped the ball. Moves such as that helped him in his off-season pursuit of wrestling, an endeavor that saw him travel across the country competing in matches. Richards played two seasons with the Yellow Jackets until the team disbanded in 1931, then he shifted to Chicago, where he played another two seasons with George Halas's Bears. In 1934, he moved on to play a season with the Detroit Lions, who had just moved from their previous home in Portsmouth, Ohio. After a final season with the Bears the next year, Richards headed west to serve as a player-coach for two seasons with the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the fledgling American Football League, helping the team finish undefeated during his second year. On April 5, 1937, he was appointed line coach at UCLA, where he served under three different head coaches over the next decade. In an era marked by the looming specter of World War II, Richards was part of two Bruin squads that competed in the Rose Bowl. He resigned on December 11, 1947, and took a similar position in 1948 at nearby Pepperdine University. One season working with the Waves' linemen led to Richards's promotion to head coach on April 26, 1949. After two seasons in that capacity, he was let go on January 19, 1951 due to budget cuts, but found work seven weeks later as an assistant with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams. During his first year working under close friend Joe Stydahar, the team captured the NFL championship, but then dropped a first-round playoff game in 1952 after Stydahar was fired early in the season. Richards was dismissed after the season, but was hired by the Baltimore Colts on January 12, 1953. When Stydahar was named head coach of the Chicago Cardinals just weeks later, he attempted to bring Richards along, but NFL commissioner Bert Bell stopped this effort, citing Richards's signed contract with the Colts. After a disastrous campaign in which the Colts finished 3‚Äì9, Richards was among the coaches let go, allowing him to join the Cardinals' staff. The 1954 campaign proved to be even worse as the team won just two of 12 games, giving them a 3‚Äì20‚Äì1 record under Stydahar's leadership. That lack of success resulted in a coaching change on June 2, 1955, when Stydahar was fired and Richards was elevated to head coach. Following a 4‚Äì7‚Äì1 season, the team appeared to be improving with a 7‚Äì5 mark in 1956. However, a 3‚Äì9 season the year after made another coaching change inevitable, and Richards resigned on January 4, 1958. Among the reasons Richards was unable to fashion a winner was his insistence on playing quarterback Lamar McHan, whose lack of leadership skills were often cited as the team's weak spot. Richards's last stop came one month later when he was hired as defensive assistant under Ray McLean with the Green Bay Packers. However, a 1‚Äì10‚Äì1 finish in the 1958 season resulted in Richards announcing his retirement from coaching. In his post-football career, Richards served as a vice president of Pemaco, Inc., a Los Angeles-based chemical company. He died of lung cancer on September 18, 1974, in Brea, California, at the age of 68.

Now as was previously stated Vimalamitra brought the Vima Nyingthig to Tibet. Padmasambhava, who brought the Khandro Nyingthig to Tibet, transmitted this to King Trisong Detsen. So both the Khandro Nyingthig and the Vima Nyingthig were within the mindstream of Jigme Lingpa and were realised by him as 'mind ter' or 'mind terma' (Wylie: dgongs-gter).

This grafting, associating and conceptual bridging of language between discrete traditions that share certain phenomena is natural but to be cautioned. The Indo-Sino-Himalayan traditions of trance, meditation, dream yoga and visionary experience of which the Longchen Nyingthig is an exemplar have been refined and transmitted through documented lineages that Himalayan and lowland traditions of Vajrayana have been at a pains to document, recite and honour in oral lore.

They seek to use his PC (player character) to destroy AIDA, a computer anomaly responsible for leaving players in a coma. Haseo's appearances in .hack//Roots depict his early days in The World as a member of the Twilight Brigade guild led by Ovan, where he first meets Shino. He has also appeared in other printed adaptations based on the .hack//G.U. games. Haseo was created by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama whose aim was for him to be a different protagonist from the previous .hack lead Kite. Since Kite was created to be the player's avatar in the original story, Haseo was meant to be more individual when it came to his characterization, by giving him darker traits. He was designed by Seiichiro Hosokawa, a new artist who joined CyberConnect2 in 2006. Takahiro Sakurai voices Haseo in Japanese. In the English version, he is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal in the games and Andrew Francis in the anime. Video game publications have published both positive and negative reviews of Haseo's character, with most of the criticism being aimed at his rude personality. On the other hand, his development across the games and the improvement to his PC resulted in positive responses. Both Sakurai and Lowenthal were praised for their role in the games. Haseo's characterization was also the subject of mixed responses in other media. Creation CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama created Haseo's character. Haseo was devised to have a darker design than previous .hack characters to reflect the more mature storyline of the .hack//G.U. games. Hiroshi Matsuyama considered Kite a relatable character and wanted the next game to feature a different type of lead character for .hack//G.U.. In contrast to the kind Kite from .hack, Haseo's antisocial personality was meant to reflect shonen manga leads who displayed iconic elements such as \\"rage, despair, conflict, courage, and victory\\". His characterization is meant to be more appealing based on how the player is distanced from him. While the third title ended Haseo's story, Matsuyama had mixed thoughts about it. In some scenes at the game's beginning, Haseo was designed with a scary look. Matsuyama aimed for Haseo to be written to give him multiple emotions to display during his quest for revenge against Tri-Edge for sending Shino into a coma. Haseo's character traits were decided at the outset, as was featuring him as both the game and the anime's protagonist to attract different audiences. Since .hack and .hack//Sign were conceived as two ongoing and connected projects, Matsuyama wanted to do the same with .hack//GU. However, he wanted both .hack//G.U. and .hack//Roots to feature the same lead character, Haseo. However, he felt it would be challenging to write them both and have them stay true to the two original projects. Matsuyama decided the basics of Haseo's character before doing anything else. When conceiving the idea of the Haseo's Xth form, his bangs were drawn to symbolise his continued immaturity. Because of the story's massive scale and it being spread across multiple media, Matsuyama brought Hamasaki in to help with the writing because of his experience working on the previous .hack project. Hamasaki wrote the game's script, so the team could focus on its development. At Hamasaki's suggestion, two different writing teams worked on the game and the anime. Personality Hamasaki claims Haseo's personality was toned down for the games to make him more appealing. In contrast, Haseo is more aggressive in the printed adaptations (written by Hamasaki) where he often threatens his enemies. Hamasaki said Haseo's traits are his attempts at writing a PC controlled by an antisocial teenager. As one of the themes of the series is \\"Grow Up\\", Haseo gradually matures across .hack//G.U. symbolized by the initials of the title. In the English version, Yuri Lowenthal was first cast to voice Haseo in the games. However, since the dub of .hack//Roots was produced separately from that of .hack//G.U., Haseo was voiced instead by Andrew Francis for the anime series. Lowenthal came to like Haseo based on his character arc to the point of cosplaying as him. The actor has noted that numerous fans commented that Haseo is similar to another character he plays, Narutos Sasuke Uchiha. Lowenthal agreed based on their antisocial characterization, but felt both of them undergo different character arcs. The second game was titled The Voice That Thinks of You with the director citing multiple relationships, including how Haseo remembers Shino's voice, how Atoli thinks of Haseo and most importantly, Ovan's relationship with Haseo. In the three games, Haseo can have a deepened bond with a friend he has met with an ambiguous romantic tone based on who is chosen. Although Atoli was the main heroine, the team had issues with writing her to the point that Matsuyama himself chose other characters when he played the game alone. This spurred him to make her more appealing for the second chapter of .hack//G.U. since he saw himself as Haseo and had to pick the heroine as she was originally set up. When it came to Haseo's scenes in the games, Matsuyama's favorites involved the ones where Haseo summoned the avatar Skeith. Takahiro Sakurai's performance as Haseo yelling at his avatar to summon it surprised the director. Designs An early rejected design of Haseo. Haseo and Ovan's visual appearances were designed by Seiichiro Hosokawa. They were Hosokawa's first creations on becoming a professional during his rookie days at CyberConnect2. Matsuyama claimed he was influenced by Manji, the main character of the manga Blade of the Immortal by Hiroaki Samura. Originally CyberConnect2 intended his first design to include more clothing, including a cape covering his body, but they ended up with a design that revealed more of his skin. The cape was meant to conceal Haseo's weaponry, but the team feared issues with how the graphics would handle this. There was a lot of trial and error working on this. When creating the 3rd Form, Matsuyama said that Haseo's black armor was meant to contrast with his rookie look to the point gamers would question what had happened to him between the series' prologue and the next timeskip. While Hosokawa designed the character, the staff asked fellow artist Yoshiyuki Sadamoto for his input whether it was an appropriate look. As a result, some of the aesthetics from Haseo's design featured in the games' original trailers were removed from the finished product. For the film .hack//G.U. Trilogy, Matsuyama wanted to give Haseo a different design as he felt retelling the story with the character having the same abilities would not attract returning fans. This was called the \\"B-st Form\\" which occurs when Haseo loses his control as Atoli's PC is killed by Ovan. In the new storyline provided for .hack//G.U. Last Recode, Hosokawa gave Haseo a new form, titled 5th. In early designs it was similar to the Xth as Haseo still wore a white shirt which was only altered with black areas on its right sleeve. Because Haseo's abdomen was showing in this form, the design of his body went through multiple revisions, including changes to the chest's black points. His hair was originally meant to be black, but Hosokawa ended up going back to its silver tone. Haseo's main weaponry in this form is known as the . Originally, the team aimed to give Haseo eight black swords, but this ended up being a red sword. Other works For the CGI movie, Matsuyama wanted Haseo to be given more realistic expressions, resulting in alterations to his design. Matsuyama also wanted the film to focus on Haseo and Atoli's relationship. In the film's trailers, Haseo's B-st form was kept secret to the point Matsuyama joked that they might be different characters. Matsuyama made many suggestions to Sakurai for the Trilogy film, including how he should act in one scene because of his many yells. In contrast to the original games where Ovan becomes Haseo's ally, the Trilogy OVA (original video animation) was written with the opposite result. Haseo's character arc in the movie shows him obsessed with violence during his struggles with Ovan, and he reaches his Xth Form when coming to terms with the flaws of his ways. Matsuyama felt this take on Haseo was well executed. For the remastered version of the trilogy, CyberConnect2 aimed to make newcomers \\"meet Haseo for the first time\\". Matsuyama wanted to use the remaster as an epilogue to Haseo's story and to promote it further, the team designed a new form for combat. CyberConnect2 wrote multiple joke videos, finding Sakurai suitable to act in them despite him finding this messy. Sakurai expressed exhaustion when talking about his work, considering he had to portray Haseo in different sorts of media. Motivated by Matsuyama, Sakurai explained he had fun with his work, especially as he had to work hard to make it appealing. This was most notable in the CGI film. One of the parody scenes involves Haseo marrying Ovan. Itsuki Hoshi designed an alternate take of Haseo wearing a wedding dress. Most of the female staff members from CyberConnect2 argued over who would wear the wedding dress in the parody scene. Appearances .hack//G.U. games While Haseo's PC evolves across the video games (from left to right), Matsuyama also wanted his hair to be modified to symbolize his character arc. Haseo is introduced in the .hack//G.U. games as a famous player from \\"The World\\", a player killer known as \\"The Terror of Death\\". He is searching for the legendary player killer Tri- Edge, who left his friend Shino in a coma in real life after killing her character. He is guided by his former comrade, Ovan, to fight the AI Azure Kite under the assumption he is Tri-Edge. However, Haseo loses the fight and the PC completely reset. As a result, Haseo is mistaken for a new player by Gaspard and Silabus, who ask him to become their guildmaster. Haseo also agrees to join the guild G.U. led by Yata, a System Administrator in The World R:2, to discover the reason behind a sudden increase in AIDA activity and Tri- Edge using it to leave players in a coma. Haseo gains an \\"Avatar\\", Skeith, The Terror of Death, hidden within his PC, that has the ability to destroy AIDA. Although initially cold and antisocial, Haseo comes to appreciate the friendships he makes across the trilogy. He also starts developing feelings for Atoli, a fellow player who encourages him to appreciate his time in The World, but is not until a later part of the trilogy that Haseo understands his feelings. Using Skeith, Haseo defeats Azure Kite, but none of Tri-Edge's victims recover. He continues working with G.U. to eliminate the AIDA that has been infecting other players and learn more about Tri-Edge. During the .hack//G.U. games, Haseo becomes a friendly person and learns to depend on others, coming to terms with his dark past. He eventually learns that the real Tri-Edge is Ovan. Ovan has been planning on Haseo to develop his Avatar abilities by fighting against multiple enemies so that he would gain enough power to destroy Ovan's own Avatar completely. In their final fight, an overwhelmed Ovan uses his Avatar's abilities to delete AIDA across the network, awakening most of the comatose players. Following this, a being called Cubia awakens and starts devouring The World; its destruction would result in the death of all the players who have yet to recover. Since the Avatars are Cubia's counterpart, Haseo and G.U. join forces to destroy their enemy using Skeith. Following Cubia's defeat, Shino awakens, much to Haseo's relief. In the HD release of the trilogy, a new chapter involves Haseo working with Pi to find a way to awake Ovan. Ovan's PC was found frozen in the World as his body remains in a coma in the real world. As Haseo searches for a way to save Ovan, he meets Zelkova's self-proclaimed sister Kusabira tells who tells him his brother disappeared after coming into contact with a monster known Vegalta. Haseo saves Zelkova from the enemy but fails to defeat it. Once recovered, Zelkova uses the data of Kusabira to fully mix the eight Epitaphs powers Skeith had absorbed into Haseo's PC. With this newfound \\"5th Form\\", Haseo and Kusabira are successful at reviving Ovan, with Kusabira being revealed as the personification of AIDA. Haseo and Ovan to defeat Vegalta with their combined Avatars. Afterwards, the two go on a final quest to remember their old times in the Twilight Brigade. G.U. related series and adaptations Haseo has also appeared in the anime television series .hack//Roots, where he is depicted as a new player who is invited to join Ovan's Twilight Brigade and search for a legendary item known as the Key of Twilight. While dealing with a rival guild, TaN, Ovan disappears, and the other members abandon the guild, leaving only Shino and Haseo. When Shino ends up in a coma after being attacked by Tri-Edge, Haseo becomes depressed and seeks revenge. In his quest for power, Haseo meets the AI of The World's creator, Harald Hoerwick, who greatly upgrades Haseo's PC. In the following months, he becomes known as \\"The Terror of Death\\" after defeating one hundred player killers, and meets Ovan again, who directs him to Azure Kite. This leads to the events of the .hack//G.U. games as a weakened Haseo continues his journey. An OVA titled .hack//Returner shows Haseo reuniting with his former comrades from G.U. and the Twilight Brigade following the events of the trilogy after receiving an email from the disappeared Ovan. In the manga adaptation of the games, .hack//G.U.+, Haseo is confronted by Ovan shortly after defeating Azure Kite. When Ovan disappears while awakening the comatose players, the player behind Haseo, Ryou Misaki, temporarily quits The World until he receives an e-mail from Ovan's sister, Aina. He returns to The World to investigate what happened to Ovan, but loses his Avatar after being attacked by Kazumi, a member from CC Corp. As Kazumi tries to use Cubia to control The World, Haseo rejoins G.U. to defeat Kazumi. In the novel series, Haseo learns that he has amnesia and that seven years before the events of .hack//G.U. he was a character named Sora who was left in a coma by Skeith until the monster's defeat. After accepting his past, Haseo gains a new form that replaces his Xth Form. The 2008 CGI film adaptation of the games, .hack//G.U. Trilogy, shows Haseo healing the AIDA-infected Atoli by combining their PCs. When Ovan leaves Atoli and all the G.U. members in coma, Haseo is consumed by rage and attacks Ovan in the new B-st Form. With help from Atoli's PC, Haseo gains the stronger Xth Form, which he uses to defeat Ovan and save him from dying using his last forces to wake up the comatose players. Other appearances In the video game .hack//Link, Haseo's time with the Twilight Brigade and G.U. during Tokio's journey in the 2017 timeline is shown. In 2020, Haseo's PC joins the Twilight Knights with Tokio and the other new members as they prepare for the final battle with a virus-infected Aura, the goddess of The World. In the manga version, Haseo's story is different. His memories have been tampered with to make him believe he is still searching for Tri-Edge to avenge Shino. The .hack//Link Special DVD shows a side story in which Haseo teams up with Asbel from Tales of Graces; both are voiced by Takahiro Sakurai. In the novel, .hack//Cell, Haseo appears in his quest for Tri-Edge. The .hack//4Koma manga features a series of omakes where Haseo has a rivalry with Kite over who is the best protagonist from the franchise. He is also a playable character in the fighting game .hack//Versus. Outside the .hack franchise, Haseo's Xth Form outfit has appeared as downloadable content in the video game Tales of Graces F. He also appears in the crossover Project X Zone 2. Cultural impact Popularity Haseo's character and his voice actors have been popular with fans. This has been the case with both the .hack//G.U. games and the CGI film where he ranks as the most popular character. In two other polls held to commemorate the .hack franchise's 10th anniversary Haseo was voted its most popular character. CyberConnect2 noted the character was popular with cosplayers. Takahiro Sakurai was a nominee in the category Best Leading Actor for his role as Haseo in .hack//Roots for the first Seiyu Awards but lost to fellow Code Geass voice actor Jun Fukuyama who portrayed Lelouch vi Britannia. Lowenthal's performance was also noted as one best from 2017, although he lost to Kyle McCarley who voiced 9S in Nier Automata. Matsuyama noted that thanks to Last Recode, Haseo's popularity has risen with a figure of the 3rd Form being developed. He claimed that the Xth and 5th Form might get their own figures based on their popularity. Critical response Critical reception to the character has been mixed. IGN compared his character with multiple anime heroes, saying his sword was \\"awe-inspiring\\" distinguishing him from the others, giving him a darker tone. Patrick Gann of RPGFan referred to Haseo as a \\"jerk\\" because of his personality and noted how much of Rebirths plot revolves around him starting to behave better. Playstationlifestyle panned his \\"bully\\"-like personality in the first title of the trilogy, noting it makes no sense that Haseo was supposed to be a sympathetic hero, describing him as a \\"misogynist with paper- thin character motivations\\". Nevertheless, the reviewer noted that Haseo developed in the second half of the story, though he still had issues with his behaviour. RPGamer writer Adriaan den Ouden commented that in Reminisce, Haseo's character development is \\"phenomenal\\", citing his interactions with Atoli and Alkaid that help him to \\"take his first steps away\\" from his dark past. RPGFan's review said that Haseo's growth in the games are one of their strongest points but still felt that most areas behind it were cliches that many players would recognize. Destructoid liked Haseo's journey in the fourth volume of .hack//GU based on the handling of his relationships. GamesRadar disliked how Haseo loses most of his powers but still retains his manners when the game begins. The evolution of Haseo's PC in the following titles was praised by Gann because of the weapons he obtains that help to improve the gameplay. However, Ouden criticized Haseo's second Job Extension design for featuring unnecessary accessories. Gunn complimented his Xth Form for including guns that make the fights more entertaining and the evolution from his Avatar, Skeith. He lamented that Haseo could only use it in the game's final battle. Ouden agreed with Gann, commenting that the use of Haseo's guns allows the player to perform different types of combos. RPGFan, Push Square and DualShockers felt that Haseo's character arc was one of the strongest parts of the narrative because he changes from an antisocial teenager to a friendly heroic PC instead. Yuri Lowenthal's performance as Haseo was also well received by Ouden, who noted he \\"nail[s] the lead voice role\\". Rice Digital and RPGamer also praised his performance in Last Recode in general. Writers commented on Haseo's role in other media. For the anime series .hack//roots DVDTalk found Haseo to be an enjoyable protagonist, especially for viewers who have watched previous series. However, the relationship with Shino was criticized as \\"melodrama\\" by the same by the same writer, though the scenario might not come off as unrealistic. Because of Haseo's constant quest for power, his screen time during the anime was criticized as weak to the point the reviewer stopped liking it. Anime News Network panned Haseo's characterization in Roots due to his antisocial mannerism seen in contrast to Tabby although the reviewer felt the narrative made it clear that both characters had flaws they have to surpass, mostly when Shino goes into a coma and they take different routes. The Fandom Post found Haseo's darker personality in Roots had potential but failed to provide an interesting result, making it feel pointless. UK Anime Network criticized Haseo's lack of interest in Roots in general, but the reviewer felt this aspect was included on purpose since it is a prequel to G.U.. Mania Entertainment found Haseo's skills useless in combat but liked his relationship with the Twilight Brigade as the cast's personalities are explored as the premise focuses on players interacting with each other. Francis' performance was viewed positively by Anime News Network despite their initial issues with the early episodes. Critics have also commented on media related to the games. IGNs take on the manga earned it a positive response because Haseo's quest is compelling thanks to player killers being something that does not discourage online gamers. Despite calling him a \\"ruthless fighter\\", Carlo Santos of Anime News Network commented that Haseo's wish to save Shino makes him an appealing character. Manga News felt that Haseo was a more striking character in the manga than in other versions because his cold personality contrasts with other shonen manga protagonists. However, the reviewer criticized his change into a more traditional hero finding that Haseo loses most of his charisma following Ovan's defeat and that his love triangle with Atoli and Shino is poorly handled. Ben Leary from Mania Entertainment, however, noted that while the game's novelization \\"takes the trouble to really get inside Haseo's head\\", the result is appealing considering Haseo's motivation and his development across the story as he is initially a loner who realizes he needs friends. Leary felt that Haseo was more appealing in the novel than in the manga version. Critics have also mentioned Haseo's role in Trilogy. Though finding Haseo unlikable in the CGI film, The Fandom Post felt Haseo's interactions with Atoli allowed him to mature and become a stronger character in the process. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network referred to Haseo's and Atoli's relationship as one of the best parts from the film .hack//G.U. Trilogy. He points to the scene where Haseo confronts Atoli's AIDA-infected. He praised Takahiro Sakurai's work voicing the character but still called Haseo an \\"unsympathetic bastard of a lead\\". Similarly, Jeuxact found Haseo too unlikable in the film in contrast to his more enjoyable persona in Roots. Capsule Monsters and Fandom Post praised Haseo's fast-paced fights as the most outstanding scenes in Trilogy along with his interactions with Ovan and Atoli.

She became an Assistant United States Attorney in 1974, and was first appointed to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by President Ronald Reagan in 1983. In 1999, she was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, by President Bill Clinton. In January 2006, she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the nomination of her colleague Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court. She took senior status in June 2011 and fully retired from the federal bench in February 2019. She is the eldest sister of U.S. President Donald Trump. Early life and education Barry was born Maryanne Trump in Queens in New York City on April 5, 1937, the eldest child of real-estate developer Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. She is an elder sister of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States . She attended Kew-Forest School. She graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1958, and a Master of Arts in public law and government from Columbia University in 1962. She later attended law school, earning her Juris Doctor from Hofstra University School of Law in 1974. Career  U.S. Attorney's Office  After being a homemaker for thirteen years, in 1974 Barry became an Assistant United States Attorney, one of only two women out of sixty-two lawyers in the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. She was in the civil division from 1974 to 1975 and in the appeals division from 1976 to 1982, serving as deputy chief of that division from 1976 to 1977 and chief of the division from 1977 to 1982. She served as Executive Assistant United States Attorney from 1981 to 1982. She was First Assistant United States Attorney from 1981 to 1983. U.S. District Court Barry was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on September 14, 1983, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey vacated by Henry Curtis Meanor. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 6, 1983, and received her commission the next day. In 1985, she recused herself in a drug-trafficking case due to her brother Donald's relationship with the accused trafficker. Her service in the district court ended on October 25, 1999, when she was elevated to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Barry's reputation on the bench was that of a tough judge with strong command of her courtroom. In 1989, while a district court judge in Newark, New Jersey, she disapproved a plea bargain that would have freed two county detectives accused of protecting a drug dealer, and forced the case to trial. The detectives were convicted and received jail terms. She also presided over the conviction of Louis Manna, the Genovese crime family mobster accused of plotting to assassinate rival John Gotti.  U.S. Court of Appeals  Trump Barry in 1992 A Republican, Barry was nominated to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by Democratic President Bill Clinton on June 17, 1999. She was nominated to fill the vacancy created when H. Lee Sarokin retired in 1996. (Clinton had nominated Robert Raymar to the seat in 1998, but that nomination had expired at the end of the year without being given a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee.) The Senate unanimously confirmed Barry on September 13, 1999. She received her commission on September 22, 1999. \\"I am deeply honored and very grateful for the nomination,\\" Barry told the New Jersey Law Journal in 1999. \\"I am surprised I was approached on it. I assume that my record is good enough as a district court judge to be reached out to, and I'm glad that politics weren't a priority here.\\" In January 2006, Barry testified in support of the appointment of fellow Third Circuit Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. In a 2006 ruling, Abou Cham v. Attorney General, Barry was harshly critical of the conduct of a U.S. Immigration Court judge in a case involving a refugee from The Gambia. The refugee petitioner was the nephew of former Gambian president Dawda Jawara, who had been deposed in a coup in 1994; the new regime had imprisoned or killed several of Cham's relatives, and outlawed their political party. Barry ruled in favor of Abou Cham; criticized Judge Donald Ferlise's questioning over a two-day hearing as bullying, belligerent, and abusive toward \\"an increasingly distraught petitioner\\"; and concluding that Cham had been \\"ground to bits\\" emotionally. Barry wrote that there was \\"not a modicum of courtesy, of respect or of any pretense of fairness\\" in Ferlise's treatment of Cham, which led Ferliste to conclude that Cham's testimony was not credible, and concluded that the Immigration Court's ruling was a \\"severe wound\\" on the American justice system. Ferlise was relieved of his duties shortly after Barry's decision. On June 30, 2011, Barry assumed senior status. She took inactive senior status in the first week of February 2017, about two weeks after her brother's inauguration as president. Barry retired on February 11, 2019. Her retirement brought an end to an investigation of whether she had engaged in fraudulent tax schemes with her siblings that violated judicial conduct rules. The investigation closed without reaching a conclusion about the allegations. Allegations of tax evasion In October 2018, The New York Times published an investigative report asserting that Barry, along with her father and siblings, had engaged in fraudulent and illegal activity for the purpose of limiting estate tax and gift tax liability stemming from Fred Trump's real estate enterprises. Investigative journalist Susanne Craig discovered a filing Barry had made to the Senate as part of her federal judiciary confirmation in 1983, in which she had reported a $1 million contribution from All County Building Supply & Maintenance. The Times reported that All County Building Supply & Maintenance was a \\"sham company\\" formed in 1992 and owned by Barry, Donald Trump, their siblings, and a cousin. All County Building Supply & Maintenance reportedly paid for work performed at Fred Trump's apartment buildings; those apartment buildings then reimbursed the company, but fraudulently added extra money to those reimbursements. Tax experts reportedly indicated that because All County \\"performed no real work, the transfer of money through the corporation was essentially a gift that evaded the 55 percent tax in place at the time\\". Its address was the Manhasset, New York, residence of John Walter, Fred Trump's nephew.According to the investigation by The Times, John Walter (1934 - 2018) managed Fred Trump's business records. Said records filled the basement of Walter's Manhasset residence. The investigation by The Times included thousands of documents such as \\"bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks\\" and over 200 of Fred Trump's tax returns. In a follow-up article, The New York Times reported that the money illicitly earned by All County was split by the Trump siblings. In October 2018, as a result of the publication of this investigation, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance began a review of the fraud allegations against Barry and her siblings. On February 1, 2019, four legal professionals, who had filed complaints against Judge Barry in October 2018, stemming from the allegations made in The New York Times, were notified by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that an investigation into judicial misconduct by Barry had been launched, in regard to her alleged participation in fraudulent tax and financial transactions. Ten days later, Barry, a senior inactive judge at the time, announced her retirement from the bench, effectively ending the investigation. Criticism of Donald Trump Barry has said little publicly about her brother during his presidency. In August 2020, Barry's niece, Mary L. Trump, revealed that she had surreptitiously audio- recorded 15 hours of discussions with Barry in 2018 and 2019. Barry sharply criticized the president in those discussions. Mary Trump publicly released a number of transcripts and audio excerpts of the conversations, including content that did not previously appear in Mary Trump's book published in July 2020, Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man. In the recordings, Barry said of her brother: \\"All he wants to do is appeal to his base. He has no principles. None. None. ... His goddamned tweeting and lying, oh my God. I'm talking too freely, but you know. The change of stories. The lack of preparation. The lying. Holy shit.\\" She added that her brother does not read and had someone take the college entrance exam in his place. She said, \\"It's the phoniness of it all. It's the phoniness and this cruelty. Donald is cruel.\\" In the recordings, Barry also criticized the Trump administration family separation policy and previous bankruptcies of Trump's businesses, adding, \\"You can‚Äôt trust him.\\" Awards In 2004, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor presented Barry with an award, named for O'Connor, that the Seton Hall University School of Law gives to women who excel in law and public service. At the presentation ceremony, Barry said, \\"I say to the women out there, remember how difficult it was for women like Justice O'Connor starting out,\\" adding, \\"Even though she graduated with top grades, she had to take a job as a legal secretary. Remember how far we have come.\\" Personal life Barry's first husband was David Desmond; the couple divorced in 1980. In 1982, she married John Joseph Barry, a New Jersey lawyer. They were married 18 years before he died on April 9, 2000. She has one son from her first marriage, David William Desmond, who is a New York psychologist.

According to the United States Energy Information Administration, approximately of oil are held in strategic reserves, of which 1.4 billion is government-controlled. The remainder is held by private industry. In 2004 the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve had the largest strategic reserve, with much of the remainder held by the other 27 members of the International Energy Agency. Some non-IEA countries have started work on their own strategic petroleum reserves. China has the largest of these new reserves.

Covering a 50% shortfall would deplete the reserves in 82 days, although export leaders the Middle East and Russian exports represent only 22% and 6% respectively of global production. International Energy Agency reserves According to a March 2001 agreement, all 30 members of the International Energy Agency must have a strategic petroleum reserve equal to 90 days of the previous year's net oil imports for their respective countries.Reauthorization of the Energy Policy & Conservation Act Only net-exporter members of the IEA are exempt from this requirement. The exempt countries are Canada, Denmark, Mexico, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Such agreements enable oil-importing countries to access these commercial reserves in a timely and cost effective way.

The Inuyasha manga and anime characters are created by Rumiko Takahashi. Most of the series takes place in a fictional version of Japan's Warring States period with occasional time-travel/flashback elements to modern Tokyo or the Heisei period. The setting and plot incorporate many elements of traditional Japanese folklore and religion; its main characters (both protagonists and antagonists) include a Shint≈ç priestess, a Buddhist monk and several types of y≈çkai, usually rendered as \\"demon\\" in English-language translations of the series.  Main characters  Inuyasha : : is the titular protagonist of the series. Born of a dog-demon father and a human mother, he has the appearance of fifteen-year-old boy who is always barefoot. As a half-demon, he had a difficult and lonely childhood, as demons and humans despised him for his mixed bloodline. Bound to a tree by priestess Kikyo, Inuyasha was under her spell for 50 years unaged and unharmed, until Kagome freed him in attempt to defeat Mistress Centipede. He has dog ears, claws, superhuman strength, and other demonic abilities. He sports a red garment called the Robe of the Fire- Rat and is always barefoot. Inuyasha also wields a strong demon sword called Tetsusaiga. Kagome Higurashi : : is the heroine of the series. A brave and kind girl who believes in never turning her back on someone in trouble, she develops a close relationship with Inuyasha over the course of the series and begins to fall in love with him during their quest to collect the Shikon shards and defeat Naraku, though she finds herself competing with the revived Kikyo for his affections. Although physically weak, she becomes stronger and skilled in archery as the series progresses, and eventually learns to master her immensely strong spiritual powers. Of all main characters in the series, she has the most emotional strength, never allowing anger or jealousy to commit acts of evil. By the start of Yashahime she is spiritually as strong as Kikyo, and possibly stronger given that she developed her own powers of arrow disappearance. :At the beginning of the series, Kagome is a fifteen-year-old junior high school student who was born in 1982 in modern Japan. She is the reincarnation of the deceased (and later resurrected) priestess Kikyo, and thus resembles the priestess in looks. Kagome has the Shikon Jewel unknowingly hidden inside her body until her fifteenth birthday, when a demon pulls her into the Bone Eater's Well at her family's shrine and takes her 500 years into the past. They emerge in the Feudal Era about fifty years after Kikyo's death, where the demon tears the jewel from Kagome's body. Miroku : : is an eighteen-year-old lecherous Buddhist monk who travels the countryside performing spiritual services, such as exorcisms and demon exterminations, though he has a habit of either ripping off or outright robbing his clients if they are rich. Miroku can attack enemies with his khakkhara and sutra scrolls, but his greatest weapon is the embedded in the palm of his right hand, which is actually a hereditary curse originally inflicted upon his grandfather by Naraku. :However, Miroku remains notorious for his lecherous and womanizing habits, usually manifesting as shameless flattery, semi-surreptitious groping, and asking almost every attractive woman he meets to bear him a child. While he learned these bad habits from the monk , who raised him after his father was engulfed into his own Wind Tunnel, Miroku also has the more serious motive of wanting an heir to continue his journey if he dies without defeating Naraku, and over time Miroku falls in love with Sango so they marry and have twin daughters - Kinu and Gyokuto and son - Hisui. Sango : : is a sixteen-year-old . She hails from a village that practices the act as their profession and is also the original home of the Shikon Jewel. While travelling, she wears a traditional woman's kimono, over which she wears long skirt, most likely \\"mo-bakama\\", and traditional woman's arm guards and leg guards, and straw sandals. As a demon slayer, Sango dresses in a black skin- tight jumpsuit, and pink armor plates made of demon parts, and a red sash. Of her broad repertoire of tools and tricks for fighting demons, Sango usually wields her most powerful weapon called the , a human-sized boomerang made of purified demon bones, which she can throw using her enhanced strength. Her other weapons include a short sword, a concealed blade and various poisons. She is always accompanied by the demon-cat Kirara, her mount. :Sango has suffered more heavily at the hands of Naraku than most; her brother Kohaku was possessed by Naraku and manipulated into killing their father and comrades and wounding her, while her village was destroyed in an attack by Naraku's minions. Kohaku was subsequently killed, but resurrected as a puppet by Naraku through a Shikon Jewel shard. Left for dead at first, Sango is tricked by Naraku into thinking Inuyasha destroyed her village; after she learns the truth, she and Kirara become the final members of Inuyasha's team. At first she is motivated solely by the desire to free her brother from Naraku's influence, but overtime she develops mutual affection and loyalty for the entire group. :Though she harbors disdain for Miroku initially (given his lecherous attitude towards women) Sango gradually develops feelings for him and each of them often risks their lives to protect the other. She accepts Miroku's roundabout proposal of marriage in the sixth season, and spends much of the seventh season trying to keep him out of danger, as his Wind Tunnel has grown to the point that it might consume him if he uses it again. After Naraku is defeated, she and Miroku marry; by the time Kagome returns to the feudal era, they have three children named Kin'u, Gyokuto, and Hisui. Shippo : : is a young orphaned kitsune, who attempts to steal the Shikon Jewel from Inuyasha and Kagome, wanting to become stronger and avenge his father's death. Though his plan fails, Inuyasha and Kagome aid him after hearing his story, and he becomes their companion. Shippo normally appears to be a young boy with certain fox-like features: his legs, feet, ears, and tail. He can shape-shift, but his other forms (such as a large flying balloon) are temporary and often ineffective, usually given away by his lingering fox tail. He can also create illusory duplicates of himself, as well as weak magic and toy-based tricks such as his giant spinning top attack. Kirara : : is Sango's faithful companion who usually appears to be a small kitten-sized feline with two tails, but can become large enough to carry several passengers whenever the need arises. She is a spiritual entity, like the kitsunes; her full-sized form has fangs and flames, while in her small form, she is small and cute.  Supporting characters  Kikyo : : was a powerful, high-ranking priestess who lived fifty years prior to the events of the series. Kikyo was given the task by demon slayers to guard and purify the Shikon Jewel. She fell in love with Inuyasha, who considered using the Shikon Jewel to turn him completely human so it would fade and she could live with him as a normal human. However, having had an indirect role in his creation, Kikyo is mortally wounded by Naraku posing as Inuyasha and believed the real Inuyasha betrayed her. Kikyo found Inuyasha, who also fell for Naraku's deception when he assumed Kikyo's form to antagonize the half-demon into attacking the village, and sealed him to the Sacred Tree. Though Naraku had expected her to use it to save her life, and corrupt it so he can have it, Kikyo dies after requesting to have the Shikon Jewel be burned with her body on the funeral pyre. Though Kikyo intended to keep it safe within her soul, the Shikon Jewel is brought back to the feudal era through her modern-day reincarnation, Kagome Higurashi. She is then revived by a demon witch Urassue with a deep grudge against Inuyasha for his apparent betrayal and supposedly inflicting her with deep, fatal wounds on her chest and left shoulder. She tried to drag Inuyasha to hell. Later, upon knowing that Naraku was the one who tricked her and Inuyasha to hate each other, Kikyo set her goal to destroy him by allowing the evil man to complete the Shikon Jewel; fragment by fragment and then purify him along with it. :She is killed once more when she got caught in Naraku's trap at the sacred mountain of Mt. Hakurei, where she was struck through with Naraku's venomous tentacles and fell into a river polluted with toxic miasma. She was eventually found in a waterfall, and healed by Kagome, though only for a short time. After being fatally hurt at the hands of Naraku yet again, she had spent her final moments with Inuyasha before she passed on for a third and final time; her spirit being carried among the twinkling stars by her Soul Collectors. Sesshomaru : : is a powerful dog demon (daiy≈çkai), feared throughout the feudal era. Born of a great demon bloodline, he is the older half-brother of Inuyasha. He is usually accompanied by his demon minions, Jaken and A-Un. Chronologically, he is over 200 years old, while according to the official Inuyasha Profiles guide by Rumiko Takahashi, his appearance is equivalent to that of a 19-year-old male. He appears as a tall and handsome young man. He has fair skin, golden eyes with slit pupils, waist-length white hair (in the anime, his hair reaches as far as his knees), magenta stripes along his cheeks and wrists, and a purple crescent moon on his forehead. Sesshomaru's true form is that of a giant red-eyed white dog. He produces an acidic poison that is mainly released from his claws in the attack. While in his true form, the Dokkas≈ç attack is transferred to his fangs. Due to his full-demon bloodline, his strength, speed and senses are all significantly greater than Inuyasha‚Äôs (except when Inuyasha‚Äôs demon blood takes control, at the expense of his mind). He viewed humans as no different than insects, which extends to Inuyasha who was born to a human mother. Sesshomaru began to see humans in a new light after he met an 8 year old human girl named Rin, who tried to treat his injuries after he was defeated by Inuyasha. After Rin was slaughtered by wolves, Sesshomaru chose to resurrect her with Tenseiga and has taken her under his wing ever since. :Sesshomaru holds his father in high esteem for being a powerful demon and desires to take his legendary sword, Tetsusaiga, for himself. He displayed an animosity towards Inuyasha for having inherited ownership of Tetsusaiga. The first battle between Inuyasha and Sesshomaru results in Inuyasha severing Sesshomaru's left arm with the sword. In order to teach Sesshomaru compassion, his father bestows him , a sword that cannot harm the living yet can bring back someone from the dead only once. Sesshomaru disdains the weapon (as he cannot use it against his enemies) but keeps the weapon for occasional use. To compensate for this, Sesshomaru has the demon swordsmith Kaijinbo forge him the mighty Tokijin, although it eventually breaks in a battle with Moryomaru. He earns his own sword Bakusaiga later in the series along with a newly regenerated left arm. Sesshomaru initially targets Inuyasha due to his obsession with possessing the Tetsusaiga, but he later shifts his focus to Naraku, his pride having been injured due to Naraku repeatedly manipulating him and Inuyasha against each other. Jaken : : is a small green imp-like demon who is extremely loyal to Sesshomaru, often praising his master's greatness, although Sesshomaru usually ignores and sometimes abuses him. Jaken himself is not especially powerful, but he wields the , a fire-throwing staff that Sesshomaru gives him. The manga explains little about Jaken's past, but the anime shows that Jaken was once a lord among similar demons. Rin : : is an eight-year-old orphan girl who is always barefoot. She finds Sesshomaru in the woods beneath a huge tree and tends to his injuries. After witnessing some bandits brutally murder her parents, Rin is sent into a period of shock, only communicating with hand gestures and friendly smiles. Rin is mortally wounded during the wolf demons' raid of her village. Sesshomaru finds Rin's lifeless body and, uncharacteristically revives her using Tenseiga. After this, Rin starts to speak and remains in company with Sesshomaru, Jaken, and A-Un. Despite his established contempt for humans, Sesshomaru continually protects Rin for the rest of the series, even showing genuine grief during The Final Act when Rin's soul is lost in the netherworld, though his mother is able to save her. Throughout the series, she is known for her kindness and loyalty to Sesshomaru, and develops a good relationship with Kohaku over the course of the series. After Naraku's defeat, Sesshomaru left Rin in Kaede's village so she can get accustomed to living among humans. A-Un : is a two-headed dragon demon with some horse-like features and Sesshomaru's beast of burden who is one of the two y≈çkai in the series explicitly stated to be a herbivore, like Totosai's ox. Despite traveling with Sesshomaru for centuries, he has no name until Rin gives him one, calling the right head \\"A\\" and the left head \\"Un\\" (the kanji symbols ÈòøÂêΩ together translate as \\"Alpha and Omega\\"). A-Un can fire y≈çkai energy from both mouths. The right head shoots blue beams of lightning, while the left shoots green lightning that can control clouds and possibly the weather and has the ability to fly like Sesshomaru. A grey cloud- like gas trails from his legs in flight, similar to Kirara's flames. Kohaku : : is Sango's eleven-year-old brother who, like his family, is also a demon exterminator. Disguised as a young nobleman, Naraku summons Sango's family and companions to slay a false demon on Kohaku's first day on the job, then controls him with a spider web and makes him kill all of the other exterminators, with Sango surviving solely by sheer luck. While Kohaku is seemingly killed by the castle's guards, Naraku resurrects him as an amnesiac puppet to use against his sister using a shard from the jewel. After several encounters with Sango and her friends, Kohaku begins to recover his painful memories and seeks to atone for the sins he committed while under Naraku's control by doing whatever he can to kill him. Kagura helps him escape from Naraku and later joins with Kikyo to use his shard to destroy Naraku. After Kikyo's death, he begins traveling with Sesshomaru's group. During a confrontation with Naraku, the piece of his Shikon Jewel was taken, but Kohaku survived thanks to Kikyo's power allowing him to live. At the end of the series, Kohaku travels with Kirara to continue his demon-slaying job to help those in need. In Yashahime, he restarts the demon slayers with Setsuna, Hisui, and Moroha. Koga : : is a wolf demon who is the young leader of the Eastern Wolf Demon Tribe that was nearly wiped out by Kagura and Naraku. He first meets Inuyasha as an opponent in battle, but becomes a reluctant, occasional ally despite maintaining a strong sense of rivalry about their relative combat strengths and the courtship of Kagome. He quickly falls in love with Kagome after kidnapping her because of her kindness and beauty. Inuyasha is always uneasy and jealous during Koga's visits because he worries that Kagome might have feelings for Koga. In this way, Koga has often been the source of Kagome's and Inuyasha's fights. Koga and Inuyasha don't get along, but the two do team up whenever Kagome's life is in danger whenever they go up against Naraku or one of his demons. :Koga later wields a most powerful weapon named and carries a sword that he does not often use that he took from a human as \\"decoration\\". Kaede : : is Kikyo's younger sister that assisted her with various tasks, such as gathering herbs or holding her quiver of arrows. After Kikyo's death, Kaede became an unusually strong shrine priestess in her own right and defends the village against demons. When Kagome arrives, Kaede recognizes her as the modern-day reincarnation of Kikyo. After Kagome frees Inuyasha, Kaede puts the \\"Subjugation Beads\\" onto him to give Kagome the ability to control him with a mere spoken word: \\"Sit.\\" Kaede is highly respected by the villagers and the members of Inuyasha's group, and she often advises them about demons and other spiritual anomalies. Though Inuyasha is easily annoyed by her, he listens to her when necessary and does not hesitate to protect her from a threat. Kaede lost her right eye sometime during her life and wears an eyepatch over it. Supplementary information states that she \\"lost her elder sister and her eye in an incident fifty years ago.\\" :In the anime, she loses her eye while helping defend the village from a demon attack shortly before the Shikon Jewel incident. Kikyo's powers weakened after falling in love with Inuyasha and in her state, she still tried to defend the village during a demon attack. A demon began attacking Kaede from behind and Kikyo fired an arrow at the demon. The demon broke into pieces from the arrow and a piece of the debris pierced Kaede's eye. In The Final Act, Kikyo's spirit appears before Kaede in a vision, apologizing for the suffering she caused her younger sister. When the vision ends, Kaede is in tears, thinking of all the years she lost with the sister she loved so much, and regrets not being able to do anything to help her. :Three years later after Naraku's defeat, Rin lives with Kaede in the village to become accustomed to living alongside other humans. While having been present when Sango gave birth to a baby boy, Kaede is also training Kagome to become a full priestess. Myoga : : is a flea demon who appears randomly and gives Inuyasha information on current events, foes, and the shards of the Shikon Jewel. Assigned to protect Tetsusaiga's hiding place in the grave of Inuyasha's father, he runs away when Sesshomaru comes there in search of the sword. Myoga often flees before or during a battle, which the others recognize as a sign of pending danger; his mere presence in any area is enough to determine its safety. Myoga enjoys drinking demon blood, and actually saves Inuyasha's life at one point by drinking a spider demon's venom out of his blood. He can save the others in a similar manner, but often gets slapped for drinking their blood without permission. In the anime, he is engaged to another flea demon named Shoga, but continually runs from her to avoid the marriage. Totosai : : is an elderly blacksmith and the creator of Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga, from the fangs of his old friend, the Great Dog General, who entrusted him to help his two sons. As Inuyasha grows stronger and Sesshomaru grows more compassionate, they become more capable of mastering their respective swords, which Totosai strengthens accordingly. He spends most of his time at his forge inside a volcano, but sometimes travels elsewhere on a flying three-eyed ox named . Totosai often appears to be a cowardly, absent- minded old man, but he has the strength to pause an attack from Sesshomaru long enough to allow Inuyasha to get away; he can breathe fire and his long forge hammer can open large fire pits in the ground. At the end of the manga, he continues his role as a blacksmith as seen when giving Kohaku a new weapon. Antagonists Naraku : :The main antagonist of the series, is the half-demon responsible for the misery of most of the main cast. He was born fifty years ago from the desires of a gravely burned bandit named , who was found by Kikyo who tended to his wounds. As the injuries had severely crippled him, Onigumo forms a pact with the surrounding demons attracted to his darkness to consume him in return for his soul to occupy a new body created from their merged bodies so that he could satisfy his frustrated lust for Kikyo. However, with Onigumo buried deep in his subconscious, the newly born Naraku acted against his human self's desire as he arranged for Kikyo's demise and her falling out with Inuyasha in the expectation that events would corrupt the Shikon Jewel. When Kikyo had the jewel burned with her corpse, Naraku bides his time until the Shikon Jewel is brought back to the feudal era by the priestess's reincarnation, Kagome Higurashi. :While Naraku originally appears in the form of a hooded figure wearing a robe made from a baboon pelt, which is also utilized by his , he later permanently assumes the guise of the young lord . :Naraku's basic abilities are shape shifting and absorbing his opponents, later gaining new abilities as he enhances himself over the course of the series. Unlike other half-demons, Naraku can choose what time of the month he loses his demonic powers, when he is reduced to a human head attached to multiple decaying demon bodies. Much to his distaste, Naraku permanently has a spider-shaped birthmark on his back that is a constant reminder of the humanity that constitutes his being. Naraku possesses several poisonous abilities, such as producing a deadly and the poisonous wasps, the latter used chiefly to prevent Miroku from uncovering his Wind Tunnel. :It is revealed near the end of the series that the demon inside the Shikon Jewel manipulated Naraku to assure his continued existence. Demon of the Shikon Jewel : is the incredibly powerful dragon y≈çkai created from numerous demons from ancient time that battled the priestess Midoriko before forcing the priestess to trap their souls in what became the Shikon Jewel. From his spirit was born the evil called Magatsuhi. :In the manga, he was created when many minor demons possessed a mortal man who secretly desired Midoriko and formed into one demon in order to kill her, similar to how Onigumo loved Kiky≈ç and created Naraku. However, unlike to Naraku, he was not a half-demon but a full demon completely devoid of human feelings. In fact, while Onigumo's deadly body was completely devoured by demons and his evil soul used as their adhesive, the human who loved Midoriko was only incorporated on the base of the dragon's neck, where you can see only his head and right hand. :It was only after Naraku's death that he reveals the Shikon Jewel's intention to trap Naraku and Kagome, then replacing him and Midoriko, to prolong its existence. The Demon manipulated Naraku and promised to satisfy his desire to obtain Kikyo's love once the jewel had been completed, but in reality he did nothing but influence him to his liking. And once the jewel has been fully restored to its previous form, he refused to satiate Naraku‚Äôs longing. :Inuyasha fights through him to reach Kagome before holding the component demons at bay. In the manga, he is destroyed forever by Inuyasha when he cuts the point of light in the darkness inside the Shikon Jewel with Meido Zangetsuha, which is the key to destroy the jewel's evil. With Inuyasha's attack at this very point, the purity of the Jewel called Naohi annihilates the evil corrupting presence within it forever, and then the Jewel's shimmering and voice completely stops. Instead, in the anime version, Kagome destroys the demon for good when she makes a selfless wish for the Shikon Jewel to be erased from existence. Magatsuhi : : is the evil corrupting presence within the Shikon Jewel, born from the spirit of the dragon demon. His existence is eventually made known to Inuyasha's group when Naraku gave him a temporary human-like body to act through to assist in the restoration of the Shikon Jewel with the personal goal to completely defile it. As it would later be revealed, Magatsuhi is responsible for sealing Kagome's full spiritual power out of fear of the girl being a threat to him. After losing his temporary body due to Bakusaiga, Magatsuhi resorts to bodily possessions before being stopped by Inuyasha with Dragon- scaled Tetsusaiga and killed by Sesshomaru with Tenseiga during the final battle against Naraku. Naraku's incarnations After acquiring enough Shikon Jewel shards, Naraku gained the ability to create new demons from his being that are technically his \\"offspring\\". However, each is treated by Naraku as expendable minions; tools to use as he wishes. He manipulated some of his earliest creations through threatening to destroy their disembodied hearts should they betray him. Eight detachments were directly created by Naraku within the series' storyline. Kanna : : is Naraku's first detachment, appearing in the form of a ten-year-old girl in white. Kanna is the only person that Naraku trusts with important information about his actions, allowing her to dictate in his stead. As a \\"concealed incarnation\\" of Naraku, Kanna has no scent or demonic aura, which makes her undetectable to Inuyasha, Miroku and Kagome, and immune to demonic aura-related effects such as the Hakurei barrier. She also is nice to Kagura and informative of Naraku's warnings. She is immune to the Infant's ability to read hearts to know what someone is truly thinking, but possesses thoughts and feelings of her own. :Kanna carries a demonic mirror that can act as a crystal ball for scrying and steal souls of those reflected in it. Once a soul is trapped by her mirror, she can control that person's body to carry out her bidding. Kagura : : is Naraku's second detachment, although she is introduced before her \\"elder sister\\" Kanna. As a wind witch who is always barefoot, Kagura uses a fan to enhance her powers where she can create a blade-like tornado or use wind to animate dead bodies. She can also use her feather hair-ornaments as transportation, enlarging them to ride in the wind. Though initially cold and calculating, Kagura despises Naraku more than she does his enemies, because he possesses her disembodied heart and uses it as a means to punish her or remind her of her place. As a result, Kagura's desire to be free leads her to covertly aid both Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, developing feelings for the latter, in hopes that they can kill Naraku for her so that she can reclaim her heart. As time goes on, Kagura becomes much more sympathetic and caring toward Inuyasha and even more hostile toward Naraku and his minions. She is ultimately killed by Naraku moments after he returns her heart, but dies content that she got to see Sesshomaru one last time and that she is free. Goshinki : : is Naraku's third detachment, a large oni with two horns extending from its head, as well as spikes protruding from his elbows. He extremely agile for his size; however, his most dangerous ability is reading minds, which he uses to avoid dangerous situations and exploit his enemies' weaknesses. When Goshinki breaks Tetsusaiga, he provides Inuyasha's demon lineage the opportunity to take over. Goshinki struggles to read the now feral and blood-lustful Inuyasha before he is completely ripped apart with only his head remaining. Goshinki's head is then found by Sesshomaru, who momentary revives the demon so his fangs can be used by Totosai's expelled apprentice, , to create the cursed blade T≈çkijin. Juromaru and Kageromaru : : and are respectively Naraku's fourth and fifth incarnations, but are extremely dangerous. While the more human-like Juromaru is like a berserker who is normally shackled with a mask covering his mouth, the parasitic Kageromaru uses his sickled arms to kill Naraku before being placed in his brother's stomach. Acting through a puppet, Naraku later removes the restraints on Juromaru so he and Kageromaru can slaughter Inuyasha's group and Koga; however, the two fail and are killed. Muso : :While technically Naraku's sixth incarnation, is actually Onigumo himself. Originally faceless and without memory of his past, Onigumo took the face and name of a wandering monk. Eventually with Kagura watching on Naraku's order, Muso ventures to Kikyo's former village and regains his memories of Onigumo and desires for Kikyo. He sees Kagome with Inuyasha and fights in order to possess Kagome. However, as the demons composing his body are beginning to break away because his human aspect is removed, Naraku is left with no choice but to reabsorb Muso back into his body. Akago (the Infant) and Moryomaru : : :The is Naraku's heart and seventh detachment, appearing in the form of a human baby yet can speak fluently and control people with the darkness in their own hearts. It is later revealed that the Infant's appearance was intentional by Naraku as he expected the detachment to be as devious as himself. His goal was to use Kagome to find the remaining shards of the Shikon Jewel. He finds her jealousy of Inuyasha's feelings for Kikyo, but Inuyasha saves her before the Infant can control her. Because the Infant possesses his heart, Naraku had the infant placed under much protection. Over time, however, the Infant and Hakudoshi conspired to destroy Naraku while making themselves the dominant aspect of his being. :To that end, Hakudoshi provides the Infant with , a demonic golem created from demons who was briefly sealed in the body of a monk named before assimilating the human's body after he was killed by Hakudoshi. While Moryomaru was originally a puppet, he gains a mind of his own when the Infant is placed inside of him. Acting as a medium of the Infant's will to become a dominant aspect of Naraku, Moryomaru goes to absorb different demons to increase his power to the point of nearly defeating most of Naraku's enemies when they ganged up on him as he destroyed Tokijin before running off. However, Moryomaru meets his end when tricked into absorbing Naraku, enabling him to reabsorb the Infant and consume Moryomaru from the inside out. Hakudoshi : :While indirectly Naraku's eighth detachment referring to himself as the embodiment of his \\"essence\\", is actually created from the right half of the Infant when he was severed in half by the power of a dying monk and matured into a barefoot boy who is extremely dexterous and proficient with a halberd and other handheld weapons. As they were originally one, Hakudoshi possesses many of the Infant's abilities while unable to be killed directly as he does not possess Naraku's heart. Hakudoshi also acquired the demon horse Entei before the steed was killed by Inuyasha. Like Naraku himself, Hakudoshi is sadistic and loves to cause chaos Byakuya : : is Naraku's final detachment created for the sole purpose of acting during Naraku's final moments, a moth-Demon who uses illusions and origami magic while able to detach his left eye to serve as recon. As Byakuya was designed to only exist as long as Naraku lives, his body can be severely damaged when Naraku suffers mortal injuries. Originally, his purpose is to observe Inuyasha and Moryomaru's growing powers and report back to Naraku, gradually becoming more active in his creator's plans. During Inuyasha's final battle with Naraku, Byakuya uses the bladeless sword he carried on his person to absorb Inuyasha's stray Meido Zangetsuha to carry out his task: slashing Kagome with time delayed Meido that would activate upon Naraku's death. Though hit by Inuyasha's Meido Zangetsuha at point blank range, Byakuya accepts his fate as he achieved his purpose. The Band of Seven The were group of human mercenaries that were killed a long time ago. They are resurrected undead manipulated by Naraku through Shikon Jewel shards to hold off his enemies during his time at Mount Hakurei. Kyokotsu : : is a giant who happens to be both the largest of the Band of Seven and the weakest. Though human, Kyokotsu has developed a taste for demons. Kyokotsu terrorizes the wolf-demon tribes before being defeated by Koga in battle, who pulls out his Shikon shard and returns him to the dead. Jakotsu : : is the Band of Seven's third- in-command and Bankotsu's most trusted ally. A homosexual and homicidal woman- hater, who wears women's kimonos and sadistically kills his male opponents as a sign of affection. Jakotsu is armed with a snake-like sword which has segmented retractable blades that reach a great distance and bend at a moment's notice, making it difficult for an opponent to calculate his next move. When Inuyasha and his group arrive at Mount Hakurei, Jakotsu battles Inuyasha until he is defeated. The fight leaves Jakotsu severely weakened and Renkotsu uses the opportunity to steal his Shikon shard. Mukotsu : : is a short man who acts as the Band of Seven's poison maker, concealing his face behind a veil. He abducts Kagome out of lust, attempting to rape her (the anime depicts him initiating a wedding ceremony before Miroku and Sango come to their friend's aid). Though he succeeds in poisoning the human heroes, Mukotsu is killed by Sesshomaru. Renkotsu : : is the second-in-command of the Band of Seven that often uses wires and fire, which he spews from his mouth, and later a hand cannon. Renkotsu is the band's most intelligent member and secretly acts against Bankotsu by stealing their comrades' Shikon shards for his use. When Bankotsu learns of this, he kills Renkotsu. Ginkotsu : : is a cyborg-like member of the Band of Seven, with a slew of different weapons, such as saw blades and a firearm on his back. Renkotsu maintains Ginkotsu's mechanical body, before it is destroyed by Inuyasha. Renkotsu then rebuilds Ginkotsu into a tank-like body. Eventually, Koga causes Ginkotsu to self-destruct by clogging his cannon with a piece of Renkotsu's armor. Ginkotsu's jewel shard is subsequently used by Renkotsu to heal his wounds. Suikotsu : : was originally a physician who developed a bloodthirsty second persona and is armed with artificial iron claws. After being revived, Suikotsu's good side attempts to live a normal life before his alter ego assumes control at the coaxing of his comrades. At one point, Suikotsu returns to the village with his normal \\"good\\" appearance, but is still violent and willing to kill. Bankotsu : : is the leader of the Band of Seven, and its youngest and strongest member. Though a skilled mercenary who killed many people, Bankotsu retains a sense of honor and compassion where his comrades are concerned. Bankotsu carries the Zanbat≈ç-like halberd , a weapon he reclaims by attacking the daimy≈ç who executed the band. Defeated by Inuyasha by slicing him in half based on the manga series, and when Banryu's power was reflected by Inuyasha's Bakuryuuha attack.  Other characters  Feudal Japan characters Hachiemon (Hachi) : :, otherwise known as simply Hachi, is a tanuki from Awa who serves Miroku. His basic abilities are low and he has no weapons or skills for battle. He is an unremarkable being, but he understands Miroku well. Although Hachi is Miroku's servant, he often does not travel with him. Since he is a tanuki, he has the ability to transform. If he puts a leaf on his head and transforms, he can assume the form of a giant yellow gourd. He can fly in this state. When he runs away, he can lay down a smoke screen to deceive enemies. Jinenji : : is a half-demon who lives in a hut with his human mother. Together, they grow a variety of medicinal plants, including some known for being powerful against poisons. He is first seen when Kirara is poisoned by Naraku's miasma and Inuyasha and Kagome travel to the village to find a cure. Because of his demon blood, the villagers falsely suspect him of killing people, but Jinenji is a gentle giant who is scared of humans because of the way they treat him. He develops a crush on Kagome, who treats him kindly and is not frightened by his appearance at all. Shunned and abused by humans during his own childhood as a half-demon, Inuyasha attempts to convince Jinenji that he needs to be more forceful towards the villagers, especially after he rescues them from the demon who really committed the murders. In the end, Jinenji decides to continue his more gentle approach, giving healing herbs to the men injured during the demon attack. Like Inuyasha, Jinenji becomes fully human once a month. During one of these times in the anime, Rin visits his home searching for the same cure to heal Jaken, who was poisoned by Naraku's demon wasps while protecting her. At the end of The Final Act, Jinenji teaches Kagome about herbs and medicine as part of her training to be a full priestess. Shiori : : is a half- demon who was born from a human mother named Shizu and a bat demon father named Tsukuyomaru. She helps grant Inuyasha's Tetsusaiga the ability to break Naraku's barrier after he saves her from the demon bats. Goryomaru : : was a monk who lived in an old temple with a group of orphaned kids. The children, whose parents were killed by demons, were rescued by him and were taken care of. Goryomaru was attacked by a demon which tried to \\"absorb\\" him. While trying to overpower the demon, his arm got replaced by the demon's laser-shooting cannon-like arm. :The children he rescued are his followers as well and employ rechargeable urn-like weapons (which resemble Goryomaru's arm) to fight and exorcise demons. The monk and the children's slaughtering of demons capture the attention of Kagura who finds the temple and attacks it. She retreats after being badly hurt by Goryomaru's beam. Following this, Hakudoshi finds Goryomaru and kills him by cutting his throat. Later, Goryomaru is revived by Naraku and is fused with Moryomaru. Dog General : :The T≈çga was an extremely powerful y≈çkai lord who ruled the Western Lands, and was known throughout Japan. Never formally addressed with a name, he fathered two sons by two different mothers: Sesshomaru from his consort, a dog demoness, and Inuyasha from a human woman named Izayoi. The Dog General is first mentioned in chapter twelve of the manga as Inuyasha's father, \\"a demon dog that prowled the lands of the west.\\" The Dog General possesses the power to absorb his enemies' attacks and make them his own, such as gaining the Meido Zangetsuha ability from Shishinki. Prior to his death, Myoga explaining that the fight played a part in his death, the Dog General sealed Ryukotsusei after being unable to kill him. The gateway to the Dog General's tomb is hidden in a black pearl (a mystical gem that creates a path between the mortal and spirit worlds) inside Inuyasha's right eye. Within the pearl, the Dog General's body is shown as an enormous dog skeleton in a suit of armor, serving a shrine where Tetsusaiga, a weapon created from his fang, was placed before Inuyasha could claim it. Over the course of the series, his sons having been in constant conflict because of succession, the Dog General was revealed to have secretly planned the events that would allow Inuyasha to inherit a perfected Meido Zangetsuha and to be able to make peace with Sesshomaru who would be able to finally stand out of their father's shadow. Izayoi : : was a gentle, beautiful human, who is the daughter of an impoverished noble house. She loved the Dog General and was saddened that the young Inuyasha was shunned for his half-demon status. Little else is revealed about her family, age, or even how she died, with Inuyasha only noting that she died \\"a long time ago\\" and that her manner of death \\"wasn't her fault.\\" Upon her death, Inuyasha inherits the Robe of the Fire Rat, which the Dog General gave Izayoi to protect her on the night Inuyasha was born, and a shell containing Izayoi's favorite lip coloring, which he gives to Kikyo in the anime. :In Inuyasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler, not directly based on the manga series, on the night of Inuyasha's birth, she was a captive of Takemaru of Setsuna and his samurai, who plan to lure the Great Dog Demon into coming to rescue her so they can kill him. Izayoi pleads with Takemaru to leave and save his own life, but Takemaru claims he loves her and stabs her through the chest with a spear. Before dying, she gives birth to Inuyasha. The Dog General, being injured by Ry≈´kotsusei, fights his way through Takemaru's men and the burning building to reach his dead lover and his newborn child. He uses the Tenseiga to restore her to life, then covers her with the Robe of the Fire Rat and orders her to flee. The Dog General names their son Inuyasha and before Izayoi flees to safety, leaving her lover to fight against Takemaru to the death. Hosenki : : is an oyster-demon who cultivates a variety of magical jewels. He created the black pearl in Inuyasha's right eye that enabled Sesshomaru to travel to his father's grave and try to steal Tetsusaiga, the sword his father willed to Inuyasha. Needing to return to the netherworld later in the series, Inuyasha's group seeks out Hosenki, but learn that he has died and his namesake son cannot make the gems yet. He tells Inuyasha that he must wait a hundred years before he can make the gems. They find another path to the netherworld where they find the departed Hosenki sitting among the bones of the Dog General's body. However, he has been corrupted by a tainted shard of the Shikon Jewel and attacks Inuyasha. After Naraku reclaims his shard, Hosenki returns to normal and gives Inuyasha the use of \\"Adamant Barrage\\", an attack gained by Inuyasha's loyalty to his friends and lack of greed. Midoriko : was an extremely powerful priestess who lived centuries before the events of the series. She was well known for her vastly strong spiritual abilities, more specifically her ability to purify demon souls and spirits, rendering them completely powerless. It was because of this ability that she was both hated and feared by demons. In her final battle, she was ambushed by many y≈çkai. The battle lasted for seven days and nights and eventually a y≈çkai, created when many y≈çkai possessed a mortal man who secretly desired Midoriko, captured her in his jaws. In one final attempt to defeat the demon, she pulled his soul into her body - fusing it with her own soul - and then expelled them both simultaneously. Both the demon and Midoriko died, but their souls combined to give birth to the Shikon Jewel. Midoriko and the demon remained imprisoned within the Jewel and continued to battle ever since. :In the ending, when Inuyasha entered the jewel, he finally saw Midoriko herself and witnessed her to help him fighting and defeating a huge amount of demons then disappearing and never returning. In the manga, the demon's desire expressed by Naraku dissolved forever her soul in order to prepare the place for Kagome. In fact, after her disappearance, the demons tells to Inuyasha that her battle with them has lasted for hundreds of years since the Shikon Jewel was born, and Kagome will continue it from here. Furthermore, as soon as the light dies, the huge spider web with Naraku's dead soul instantly appears. Then, Inuyasha became her true successor in the ancient fight against the demon. Instead, in the anime series, after Kagome makes her wish to destroy the jewel and also stop its plan to replace the demon and Midoriko with Naraku and herself, Midoriko ceased her fighting and disappeared along with the demons she fought, implying that her battle had finally ended and she was allowed to move on to the afterlife. Ginta : : is a wolf demon from the Eastern Wolf Demon Tribe that always follows Koga around, alongside Hakkaku. They both deeply worry about Koga and Kagome since she is almost always in trouble with Inuyasha around. Hakkaku : : is a wolf demon from the Eastern Wolf Demon Tribe that always follows Koga around, alongside Ginta. They both deeply worry about Koga and Kagome since she is almost always in trouble with Inuyasha around. Ayame : : is a red- haired wolf demon that appears only in the anime. She is the granddaughter of the North Wolf Demon Tribe's leader. Koga once saved her from the Birds of Paradise and promised to marry her when she got older. In the epilogue of the anime, Ayame finally married Koga. Mushin : : is an elderly Buddhist monk who raised Miroku after his father was consumed by the Wind Tunnel curse. Despite being a lazy drunk who taught Miroku many of his bad lecherous habits, he cares for the young monk and is a father figure to him. In his first appearance, he was possessed by a demon worm charmer hired by Naraku to kill Miroku, but was saved by Inuyasha. Mushin is not seen in the manga again after this, but is given a slightly larger role in the anime. Modern Japan characters Kagome's family ; : :Mrs. Higurashi is the mother of Kagome and Sota. She is never given a name. The novel Shousetsu Inuyasha reveals that her husband, Kagome's father, was killed in a car accident when Kagome was five years old. Since then, she was widowed and left to take care of her two children, with the help of her father-in-law. She is very supportive of Kagome and welcoming to Inuyasha. She helps Kagome by taking care of the lunches and dinners for her to bring to Inuyasha's world for them to share with her friends. She does not appear to mind Kagome spending long periods of time in the feudal era. ; : : is Kagome's younger brother, with whom she has a typical brother-sister relationship. He looks up to Inuyasha as an older brother figure. In Yashahime he adopted Kagome's niece Towa as his daughter. He had wife named Moe Higurashi and daughter named Mei Higurashi. ; : : is the paternal grandfather of Kagome and Sota, and Kagome's mother's father-in-law. Grandpa often covers for Kagome's prolonged absences at school with interesting, and often absurd, excuses, which make Kagome's friends worry a lot about her. ; : : is the Higurashis' lazy pet cat, who was the reason Kagome first found the Bone Eater's Well while she was looking for him. Inuyasha often plays with Buyo when he visits Kagome in her time era. Kagome's friends ; : : is a school friend of Kagome who has a crush on her. Kagome's school friends think that they should be together, but Kagome never took the dates he asked her on seriously, even though she agreed and every single time would either forget or bail out on the dates so that she could go back to the feudal era to be with Inuyasha. Hojo is always under the pretense that Kagome has a fatal illness, due to the excuses Kagome's grandfather tells in order to keep Kagome out of school for long periods of time while she is in the Feudal Era. Because of this, Hojo is frequently seen giving Kagome traditional remedies and supplies for her various fictional illnesses. Sometimes, her grandfather uses the gifts from Hojo on himself. In the ending of The Final Act, Hojo is seen dating his college classmate after the series ended. ; : : is one of Kagome's friends from the modern era. She has wavy shoulder-length black hair. Being the naive, optimistic, gentle one of the three, she is the only one of the group to express support for Kagome's relationship with Inuyasha. ; : : is one of Kagome's friends from the modern era. She has straight shoulder-length black hair and is frequently shown wearing a yellow headband. Like Yuka, she is very outspoken and concerned with Kagome's relationship health, and because of this, she never hesitates to give her opinion on Kagome's potential boyfriends (Hojo and Inuyasha). ; : : is one of Kagome's friends from the modern era. Yuka has neck-length brown hair. Being the most outspoken of the three, as well as being very sharp-witted, she often expresses concern over Kagome's relationship with her \\"delinquent boyfriend,\\" Inuyasha.  Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon characters  Towa Higurashi : : is Sessh≈çmaru‚Äôs first daughter and Setsuna's older twin sister. She was somehow transported to the modern era through the power of the Tree of Ages and the Bone Eater's Well when she was just four-years-old. She received shelter from her uncle's in-laws, the Higurashi family, and was subsequently raised by her half-uncle-in-law, S≈çta Higurashi. She is reunited with her sister Setsuna after spending ten years in modern times. She wields the sword and carries the Silver Rainbow Pearl inside her left eye. Setsuna : : is a half-demon demon slayer who works under Kohaku. She was separated from her older twin sister Towa when they were both four-years-old but was reunited with her after traveling to the future with her cousin Moroha. She seems to have difficulty believing Towa is really her sister, given that she lost all memories of her past, which according to Moroha, is due to the influence of a Dream Butterfly which also rendered her unable to sleep or having dreams. She wields the naginata and carries the Golden Rainbow Pearl inside her right eye.  Moroha : : is the daughter of Inuyasha and Kagome Higurashi, a quarter-demon bounty hunter known as who slays demons and sells their parts to other demon slayers, presumably so they can make weapons and armor out of them. She wields the y≈çkai sword and carries the Red Rainbow Pearl with her. Tragically, Moroha knows very little of her parents as she has lived alone most of her life. She likely knows her cousin Setsuna through her business dealings with demon slayers. Hisui :, Larissa Tago Takeda (as baby) : is Miroku and Sango's only son and the youngest of their three children, who first appears at the end of the original series as a baby. In Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon, he is now a young man who has taken up demon slaying and inherited Hiraikotsu from his mother. Takechiyo : : is a young tanuki. Mei Higurashi : : is the daughter of Sota and Moe Higurashi, adoptive sister of Towa and the niece of Kagome Higurashi, and the maternal cousin of Moroha.

Developed by Peter Pyhrr in the 1970s, zero-based budgeting starts from a \\"zero base\\" at the beginning of every budget period, analyzing needs and costs of every function within an organization and allocating funds accordingly, regardless of how much money has previously been budgeted to any given line item. History As an accounting manager for Texas Instruments, Peter Pyrrh created zero-based budgeting to facilitate the incorporation of top-level strategic objectives into the budgeting process by tying them to specific functional areas within the organization. Under his system, costs are grouped and measured against previous results and current expectations, enabling management to allocate funds by current need instead of by historical expenditures. Author of Zero Based Budgeting: A Practical Management Tool for Evaluating Expenses, Pyhrr was appointed by then-Georgia governor Jimmy Carter to manage the state's budgetary process. Advantages #Accuracy: This type of budgeting helps companies to look over every department to make sure they are getting the correct amount of money. #Efficiency: It helps judge the actual needs by focusing on current numbers instead of past budgets. #Reduction in wasteful spending: It can remove redundant spending by re-examining potentially unnecessary expenditures. #Coordination and Communication: It allows for better communication within departments by involving employees in decision- making and budget prioritization. Disadvantages #Bureaucracy: Creating ZBB within a company can take enormous amounts of time, effort, and analysis that would require extra staff. This could cause the process to be counterproductive in cutting costs. #Corruption: In using ZBB, managers could attempt to skew numbers to make expenditures into vital activities, thus creating a \\"need\\" for them. This would cause companies to continue wasting money on things they don't need. #Intangible Justifications: This type of budgeting requires departments to justify their budget, which can be difficult on many levels. Departments such as advertising and marketing have to justify expenses they may or may not use in the next year due to the fluctuation of the market. This could cost them profits in the future due to not being able to justify a certain amount. #Managerial Time: ZBB comes at the cost of time and extra training for managers. This means extra time every year to do the budget, make adjustments and receive the proper training to understand how to do ZBB. #Slower Response Time: Due to the amount of time and training is required to do ZBB, managerial staff could be less likely to revise the budget in response to a changing market. This means that it will take longer for a company to move money into departments that need it the most at the time. ZBB could potentially leave gaps in a company because the budget might not react to departments' sudden needs. Use in public and private sectors Background Zero-based budgeting in the public sector versus the private sector is a different process. \\"The use of ZBB in the private sector has been limited primarily to administrative overhead activities (i.e. administrative expenses needed to maintain the organization). In the United States Zero-based budgeting was developed in 1969 at Texas Instrument Inc. Jimmy Carter, then Governor of Georgia, was the first to adopt the process of zero-base into the government for the preparation of the fiscal of 1973 budget. Three years later, sponsored by the President and Congress the federal government for the first time implemented zero-base budgeting in The Government Economy and Spending Reform act of 1976.Pyhrr, Peter A. \\"The Zero-Base Approach To Government Budgeting.\\" PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW, Jan. 1977. President Carter later required the adoption of ZBB by the federal government during the late 1970s. \\"Zero-Base Budgeting (ZBB) was an executive branch budget formulation process introduced into the federal government in 1977. Its main focus was on optimizing outputs available at alternative budgetary levels. Under ZBB agencies were expected to set priorities based on the program results that could be achieved at alternative spending levels, one of which was to be below current funding.\\"GAO, Performance Budgeting: Past Initiatives Offer Insights for GPRA Implementation (March 1997). For most of the United States government, the main users of ZBB are the legislative, executive, and the agency. The legislative includes the congress, state legislature, and city council, and they require more summarization and focusing on public priorities and objectives. Agencies include the agency director and department managers and they require more detailed information and focus on program implementation and efficiency. Lastly, the executive includes the President, governors, mayor/city manager and they focus on the needs of the legislature and agency. Although the legislative, the agency, and the executive have different focuses they all have to address two standard questions: # Are the current activities efficient and effective? # Should current activities be eliminated or reduced to fund higher-priority new programs or reduce the current budget? According to Peter Sarant, the former director of management analysis training for the US Civil Service Commission during the Carter ZBB implementation effort, \\"ZBB means 'different things to different people'.\\" Some definitions imply that zero-based budgeting is the act of starting budgets from scratch or requiring each program or activity to be justified from the ground up. This is not true; the acronym ZBB is a misnomer. ZBB is a misnomer because in many large agencies a complete zero-base review of all program elements during one budget period is not feasible; it would result in excessive paperwork and be an almost impossible task if implemented.\\"Peter Sarant, Zero-base Budgeting in the Public Sector, A Pragmatic Approach (Addison-Wesley 1978). In many respects, the \\"common misunderstanding\\" of ZBB noted above resembles a \\"sunset review\\" process more than a traditional public sector ZBB process. Components of a public sector ZBB analysis In an overview of zero-based budgeting, there are a total of three elements that make up the concept: # Decision Unit Determination: the building process of the formulation of a budget structure. # Decision Package Formulation: when compiling and packaging a budget request, this is the mechanism is utilized. # Ranking: this process requires the most attention as it requires a company's manager(s) to prioritize out of a group of decision packages that are laid out to them. In general three components make up public sector ZBB: # Identify three alternate funding levels for each decision unit (Traditionally, this has been a zero- base level, a current funding level, and an enhanced service level.); # Determine the impact of these funding levels on program (decision unit) operations using program performance metrics; and # Rank the program \\"decision packages\\" for the three funding levels. In many cases, program staffers were asked to look for alternative service delivery models that could deliver services more efficiently at lower funding levels. The US General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed past performance budgeting initiatives in 1997 and found that ZBBs \\"main focus was on optimizing accomplishments available at alternative budgetary levels: Set priorities based on the program results that could be achieved at alternative spending levels, one of which was to be below current funding. # In developing budget forms, these were to be ranked against each other sequentially from the lowest level organizations up through the department and without reference to a past base. # In concept, ZBB sought a precise link between budgetary resources and program results.\\" Further, \\"ZBB illustrated the usefulness of: # Defining and presenting alternative funding levels; and # Expanded participation of program managers in the budget process.\\" The federal ZBB budgeting system had the following components: \\"Budget requests for each decision unit were to be prepared by their managers, who would (1) identify alternative approaches to achieving the unit's objectives, (2) identify several alternative funding levels, including a \\"minimum\\" level normally below current funding, (3) prepare \\"decision packages\\" according to a prescribed format for each unit, including budget and performance information, and (4) rank the decision packages against each other.\\" ZBB was officially eliminated in federal budgeting on August 7, 1981. \\"Some participants in the budget process, as well as other observers, attributed certain program efficiencies, arising from the consideration of alternatives, to ZBB. ZBB established within federal budgeting a requirement to: # Present alternative levels of funding; and # Link (them) to alternative results.\\" This element of the ZBB budgeting process remained in effect through the Reagan, Bush and early Clinton administrations before being eliminated in 1994.  Defining the government program zero-base  As noted earlier, there is often considerable confusion over the meaning of zero-base budgeting. There is no evidence that public sector ZBB has ever included \\"building budgets from the bottom up\\" and \\"reviewing every invoice\\" as part of the analysis. In discussions of ZBB, there is often confusion between a ZBB process and a sunset review process. In a sunset review, the entire function is eliminated unless evidence is provided of program effectiveness. This confusion ultimately leads to the question: what is a zero-base? Sarant's definition of the zero-base based on the federal training experience is: \\"A minimum level is the grassroots funding level necessary to keep a program alive. Therefore, the minimal level is the \\"program or funding level below which it is not feasible to continue a program... because no constructive contribution can be made toward fulfilling its objective.\\" Identifying this level of program funding has been subjective and problematic. Consequently, \\"some states have selected arbitrary percentages to ensure that an amount smaller than last year's request is considered. They do this by stipulating that one alternative must be 50, 80, or 90 percent of last year's request.\\"Thomas D. Lynch, Public Budgeting in America (Prentice-Hall, 3rd Edition, 1990). This equates to analyzing the impact on program operations of a 10, 20 or 50 percent reduction in funding as the \\"zero bases\\" funding level. Importance of performance measures Performance measures are a key component of the ZBB process. At the core, ZBB requires quality measures that can be used to analyze the impact of alternative funding scenarios on program operations and outcomes. Without quality measures ZBB simply will not work because decision packages cannot be ranked. To perform a ZBB analysis \\"alternative decision packages are prepared and ranked, thus allowing marginal utility and comparative analysis.\\" Traditionally, a ZBB analysis focused on three types of measures. \\"They (federal agency program staff) were to identify the key indicators to be used in measuring performance and results. These should be \\"measures of: # effectiveness, # efficiency, and # workload for each decision unit. Indirect or proxy indicators could be used if these systems did not exist or were under development.\\" Impact on government operations According to the GAO, \\"Agencies believed that inadequate time had been allowed to implement the new initiative. The requirement to compress planning and budgeting functions within the time frames of the budget cycle had proven especially difficult, affecting program managers' ability to identify alternative approaches to accomplishing agency objectives. Some agency officials also believed that the performance information needed for ZBB analysis was lacking.\\" Also, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures:National Conference of State Legislatures, Fundamentals of Sound Budgeting Practices, June 1995 http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/BudgetTax/FundamentalsofSoundStateBudgetingPractices/tabid/12653/Default.aspx, \\"In its original sense, ZBB meant that no past decisions are taken for granted. Every previous budget decision is up for review. Existing and proposed programs are on an equal footing, and the traditional state practice of altering almost all existing budget lines by small amounts every year or two would be swept away. No state government has ever found this feasible. Even Georgia, where Governor Jimmy Carter introduced ZBB to state budgeting in 1971, employed a much-modified form. State programs are not, in practice, amenable to such a radical annual re-examination. Statutes, obligations to local governments, requirements of the federal government, and other past decisions have many times created state funding commitments that are almost impossible to change very much in the short run. Education funding levels are determined in many states partly by state and federal judicial decisions and state constitutional provisions, as well as by statutes. Federal mandates require that state Medicaid funding meet a specific minimum level if Medicaid is to exist at all in a state. Federal law affects environmental program spending, and both state and federal courts help determine state spending on prisons. Much state spending, therefore, cannot usefully be subjected to the kind of fundamental re-examination that ZBB in its original form envisions. To the extent that ZBB has encouraged governors and legislators to take a hard look at the impact of incremental changes in state spending, it produced a significant improvement in state budgeting. But in its classic form ‚Äì begin all budget evaluations from zero ‚Äì ZBB is as unworkable as it ever was.\\"  Use in the Chinese Public Sector  The concept of ZBB was first introduced to China at the beginning of the 1990s and was primarily focused in the Hubei Province area of China. Just as the United States encountered many problems and failures with ZBB, China ran into them as well. But even with the numerous problems and failures along the way, they have gradually adjusted appropriately since then to become more effective in using ZBB as a budget reform. Western influence on budgeting was non-existent in China before 1993. It was during the 1990s that China began looking out for a new and modern form of budgeting for their country‚Äôs nationwide budget reform. They ended up settling on ZBB. A new policy was set in place to put ZBB into action, known as the DBR, or the Departmental Budgeting Reform. The DBR and ZBB were first implemented in the Hubei province of China. According to Jun Ma, a professor at the University of Nebraska, the beginning years of ZBB in Hubei were a bit rocky as the DBR had not yet been implemented into all the state departments in Hubei. Only a few departments implemented the budgeting system and the results of multiple departments using multiple budgeting systems were not good. It slowly became clear that using ZBB in a traditional sense would not work out. Officials in the Hubei province and the DBR began looking for ways to incorporate the best parts of ZBB and form a new budgeting system that would work for their needs. The result of this change was a Chinese-styled Target-Based Budgeting system. This form of budgeting required bureaucracies and agencies to submit a simple budget within a pre-set time limit. TBB, as a modified form of ZBB, has worked out moderately well for the Chinese government in Hubei over the years, but many problems still face the budgeting system. Some number of issues ranging from the absence of a unified budget and certain expenditures that are somehow exempt from the ZBB process, to the influence or effects of political factors have been widely noted. # Absence of a Budget Unification- Though the Hubei Province has developed a thorough budget by combining expenditures and off-budget revenues into the budget, there yet remains certain types of expenses that are still under the control of certain individuals other than the government Finance Department. Because of this, the difficulty of prioritizing all the possible government programs becomes confusing. # Political Factor Influences- No matter what the term or whose term it is, political officials have always had a certain plan or change that they would like to implement that would greatly influence the prioritizing process of ZBB. Certain political officials could say they greatly support a certain program and would like the Finance Department to focus more money on that particular program whilst other political officials would think otherwise. Therefore, any real changes or improvements made will always face opposition unless they have unified political support. # Expenditure exemptions- Ranging from operating and personnel expenses to central government policies that are unfunded that start after the budget year, these are just to name a few things that are excluded from the ZBB process. By not including a large portion of spending into the ZBB process, the effectiveness potential of these reforms becomes greatly reduced. Two notable reforms to the ZBB process include having departments submit budget requests and the use of sunset legislation. # Budget requests- These requests are to reflect (1) a cut of a certain percentage, (2) current level of spending, and (3) an increase of a certain percentage. This allows the opportunity of trading between departments of the funding of a lower priority of one department to a higher priority of another. # Sunset legislation- This process places a sense of urgency on certain programs implemented or that are currently being funded as that program shall be placed under review to determine efficiency & effectiveness, and see whether the public or government need this program.

Carlos Brito (businessman), a protege of Jorge Paulo Lemann, \\"brought to Anheuser-Busch the concept of ‚Äúzero-based budgeting,‚Äù wherein every expense must be newly justified every year, not just new ones, and the goal is to bring it lower than the year prior.\\" at Anheuser-Busch InBev as early as in the 1990s. Following their decade of lessons in ZBB, 3G Capital employed similar cost management concepts at their next acquisitions: Burger King, Tim Hortons, Heinz, Kraft Foods, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. The use of ZBB might have continued the subjective notion that this budgeting style is a fix-all for businesses trying to lighten the load of a new company.https://hbr.org/2016/06/zero-based-budgeting-is-not-a-wonder-diet-for- companies This concept triggered measures as drastic as cutting hundreds of management jobs and jettisoning corporate jets, to as simple as requiring employees to ask to make photocopies.https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-heinz- to-kraft-zero-based-budgeting-sweeps-across-america-1427308494 Following the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz, some analysts and former employees blamed 3G Capital's use of ZBB for the company's poor performance.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/business/kraft-heinz- food-3g-capital- management.html?action=click&module;=Top%20Stories&pgtype;=Homepage  Impact of ZBB on stockholders According to Accenture, \\"examples of companies that have successfully implemented ZBB...include a consumer goods company that was able to achieve 18 percent savings and a 20 percent increase in the share price. Another case was that of a prominent commercial bank, which unlocked a large sum of money and reinvested it in ‚Äògoing digital‚Äô, and a healthcare company that achieved savings of ¬£1.2bn (‚Ç¨1.36bn) for three years.\\" As a result, companies are vocal about their use of ZBB programs in their earning calls including Mondelƒìz International, Campbell Soup Company, Kraft Heinz, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Tesco. In its 2017 first-half results, Unilever even reported that ZBB was improving its marketing productivity and streamlining its advertising spend, while also reducing overhead costs that weren‚Äôt bringing much value. In another case, the use of ZBB within 3G Capital has been profitable for stockholders. When 3G Capital quickly cut costs within Kraft, their stock prices increased 36% as a direct result. This type of budgeting enabled companies like Kraft to compete again on price with some of the leaner competition, that had previously undercut Kraft's prices. Zero- based budgeting helps more money to flow to stockholders than into unused departments, over-funded programs, and wasteful spending habits.

Before joining the NCA Johnny was a serving Chief Officer with Police Scotland and had previously been Deputy Director General of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency. He was seconded to the NCA in June 2013 and was Deputy Director of the Organised Crime Command before competing for and being appointed to the role of Director of the CEOP Command. Previous heads of CEOP include Jim Gamble and Peter Davies. Prosecutions CEOP gained its first successful prosecution in June 2006, when Lee Costi, 21, of Haslemere, Surrey, was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court where he admitted grooming schoolgirls for sex, as well as possession of indecent images of children. Costi was caught when a Nottingham girl told her mother about his chatroom messages. Judge Jonathan Teare sentenced Costi to a total of nine years in prison. Following this, in June 2007, Timothy Cox was jailed at a court in Buxhall, Suffolk, following a 10-month operation by CEOP Officers, as well as other Virtual Global Taskforce Members, leading to 700 new suspects being followed up by law enforcement agencies around the world.Latest news ‚Äì CEOP The CEOP claims to have disrupted or dismantled 262 sex-offender networks between 2006 and 2010, and it says inquiries by its online investigators have led to more than 1,000 arrests during that period.  Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation  In September 2015, gross misconduct notices were served on four police officers who had held management roles in CEOP. The actions were part of an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation into a 16-month delay in passing on information about 2,345 British child abuse suspects which had been received in 2012 from the Toronto Police Service. A spokesman for the IPCC said: \\"Two of the officers have retired since the incident, one officer remains at the [National Crime Agency] NCA and one officer who was on secondment from Lincolnshire Police has since returned there. All four notices are for failing to adequately progress and manage the referral by Toronto Police from Project Spade. The investigation remains ongoing.\\" The information received from Canada included details about doctor Myles Bradbury, who was subsequently imprisoned for 22 years for sexual assaults on 18 child patients at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, and Martin Goldberg, the deputy head of Thorpe Hall School in Southend, who was found dead the day after he was interviewed by police about images of children undressing in changing rooms which had been found in his possession.

Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved 20 November 2017 on a plea bargain for killing and committing to kill six people in the Stevenson Commons complex in the Soundview area. The terms of his plea bargain stipulate that he may be indefinitely held in segregation subject to special administrative measures which restrict communication. A model prisoner at Florence, his attempts to lessen these restrictions have been unsuccessful due to fear by prosecutors that any suggestion he might make would be promptly carried out by S.M.M. members. S.M.M. eventually affiliated itself with the United Blood Nation, which emerged during the 1990s. Over a relatively short time S.M.M. spread to other locations. They are primarily located in the Soundview section of the Bronx, as well as the South Bronx and many eastern Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Crown Heights and East New York. On Long Island the gang is growing, it is particularly large in Roosevelt, New York and to a lesser extent in Hempstead, New York. During the summer of 2004 Tommy Thompson established the S.M.M. in Jersey City, New Jersey. On October 31, 2004 an 18-count Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) indictment charged Thompson with one count of racketeering, encompassing specific and non-specific, robbery and robbery conspiracy, heroin and cocaine conspiracy and distribution. The indictment also charged Thompson with nine counts of violent crimes in aid of racketeering, including specific attempted murders, murder conspiracy, robberies and shootings; four counts of possession, use and carrying of a firearm for violent crime; one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and heroin, and one count of heroin distribution.US Department of Justice, 2004 News Releases and Charging Documents Thompson pleaded guilty on July 6, 2005, and admitted that he directed other members and associates of the Sex, Money, Murder set to commit acts of murder and assault - and took part in one of the assaults himself.

Profile Mission 1939 Air Transport Association advertisement with Eleanor Roosevelt promoting commercial air transportation in the US A4A's stated purpose is to \\"foster a business and regulatory environment that ensures safe and secure air transportation and enables U.S. airlines to flourish, stimulating economic growth locally, nationally and globally\\". A4A advocates on behalf of participating regularly scheduled airline corporations to the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, the U.S. Department of Transportation, including the Federal Aviation Administration, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, including the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection. Since its founding in 1936, A4A has played a major role in all government decisions concerning aviation, including the creation of the Civil Aeronautics Board, the creation of the air traffic control system and airline deregulation. It also advocates that the American government implement a national airline policy that will enable U.S. airlines to function as effective multinational enterprises. Furthermore, it believes an element of such a policy is the modernization of the U.S. air traffic management system, the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). Leadership Nicholas Calio Nicholas Calio became president of the Air Transport Association (as Airlines for America was then known), in January 2011. Calio was hired after the Republicans made big gains in the 2010 midterm elections. Hiring Calio, \\"a brand name\\" Republican, known for working well with Democrats, was seen as a positive for the ATA. Democratic lobbyist Jimmy Ryan said: \\"He‚Äôs so well liked by both Democrats and Republicans that for the ATA it‚Äôs a huge coup. The new challenge is figuring out how to get things done in a bipartisan manner and Nick is the guy who‚Äôs got the record to do it.‚Äù Senator Harry Reid said, \\"...Nick was a straight shooter and I appreciated that about him when he was at the White House. The ATA is fortunate to have a seasoned hand who understands the importance of finding bipartisan solutions.‚Äù Government relations A4A senior staff members have testified before Congress in favor of lowering taxes on airlines, arguing that current policies reduce profits and growth in the industry. The A4A has also lobbied on topics such as enhancing competition in international markets and advocating for a comprehensive review of the FAA's NextGen program costs, benefits, progress and management. A4A works with its members on legal and technical issues affecting the U.S. airline industry. A4A operates member committees related to fuel; airports; engineering and maintenance; the environment; training; security; facilitation; ground safety; cargo; passenger services; communications; government affairs; and international affairs. A4A advocates common association member positions before state and local governments to assure governmental and public understanding of the A4A's positions on the aspects of commercial airlines. Legislative and regulatory priorities A4A's priorities include maintaining airline safety; maximizing airline profits; reforming energy-commodity markets; creating an international framework for reducing industry emissions; accelerating modernization of the air traffic control system; and reducing taxes on airlines. National airline policy Airlines for America supports NextGen modernization of the air traffic control system. This system will update the current 1950s radar- based technology with a modern, satellite-based navigation system. Aviation experts predict that a modern air traffic management system will save jet fuel and reduce delays by allowing planes to fly shorter routes and by allowing more aircraft to fly safely at any given time. Modernizing the air traffic control system would also reduce the amount of time that airplanes spend waiting on runways and in holding patterns. Officially, the A4A has announced five \\"core elements\\" of a national airline policy include reducing taxes on the industry, reducing regulation, increased access to foreign markets, making the industry more attractive for investors, and improving the air traffic control system. A4A President and CEO, Nicholas E. Calio, said, \\"Airlines enable their local businesses to export goods, connect their residents to the world for business and leisure travel ‚Äì and, importantly, create good-paying jobs. We face the very real risk of U.S. airlines increasingly shifting to feeding foreign airlines at our gateways, rather than expanding their flying of lucrative international routes.\\" In 2011, Calio said that the value of American exports shipped by air was 117 times the value of exports transported by sea and that commercial aviation had become an important catalyst for the economy. Calio said that the regulatory and tax environment, in addition to inadequate infrastructure, are making it hard for the US airline industry to compete internationally and still turn a profit. Consumer protections On April 25, 2011, the Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections, \\"76 Federal Regulation 23110\\" rule was enacted. Amongst other items, the rule includes raising the minimum \\"denied boarding compensation\\" to customers with valid tickets yet still not allowed to board the aircraft. The legislation further penalizes airlines up to $27,500 per passenger if left stranded aboard an aircraft, on a tarmac for more than three hours. In 2010 the then Air Transport Association and the Regional Airline Association both opposed this legislation. The ATA stated, \\"As we have noted before, competition in the marketplace and existing Department regulations supported by fair enforcement are sufficient to ensure airlines continue to deliver good customer service.\\" Taxes In 2013, Airlines for America assembled a coalition of labor, business, and consumer advocacy groups in order to oppose increasing the tax on airline tickets that funds the Transportation Security Administration. A4A called this campaign \\"Stop Air Tax Now.\\" A4A's efforts were in response to a proposal in late 2013 to increase the tax to $5.00 from $2.50 per ticket. In 2012 this tax generated about $2.3 billion in revenue, double the amount for 2002. A4A staffers handed out air-sickness bags and leaflets at Washington Reagan National Airport asking \\"Are higher taxes on air travel making you sick?\\" Nicholas Calio said, \\"Raising taxes is lose-lose for airlines, passengers, jobs and our overall economy ‚Äì it‚Äôs inappropriate for Congress to use airline passengers as an ATM when it needs more money. Doubling the TSA passenger security tax would cost passengers more than $730 million annually, placing a huge additional tax on the traveling public, with no direct benefit to those who pay it.‚Äù In 2014, Airlines for America supported legislation, the Transparent Airfares Act of 2014 (H.R. 4156; 113th Congress), to advertise ticket prices by their base fare in addition to various government fees and taxes. The legislation would reverse Department of Transportation regulations implemented in 2012 that force airlines to advertise base fares lumped together with taxes and fees. Airlines for America argues that current regulations hide excessive taxes on air travel. Nicholas Calio said, \\"It's a misnomer to characterize the current law as a consumer protection rule when it really protects the government, not airline passengers, and it's disingenuous for Washington to hide the ball and not be held responsible for the taxes they impose on air travel.\\" A4A said that as of 2014, $61 of a $300 domestic airfare is taxes. Energy Airlines for America also has been involved in promoting fuel efficiency and the development of alternative fuels. In April 2014, Nancy Young, A4A's Vice President of Environmental Affairs, testified before the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry on alternative aviation fuels. Young pointed out that airlines have a natural incentive to be energy efficient and outlined what the airline is doing to support aviation biofuels. Young encouraged the federal government to further support public-private partnerships such as the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative (CAAFI), the Farm to Fly program. A4A opposed efforts by the European Union to unilaterially extend its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to international aviation. The European Union Parliament stayed the extension of the ETS until 2016. The extension of \\"stop the clock\\" on ETS was consistent with the agreement reached at the International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly in 2013, which rejected unilateral regulations of carbon emissions while committing the airline industry to achieve carbon neutral growth starting from 2020. The US Congress passed a law authorising the secretary of transportation to prohibit American aircraft operators from complying with the EU ETS.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140403006226/en/Airlines-America- Commends-EU-Parliament‚Äôs-Vote-Extend#.U1f-nty808M Litigation Labor relations In 2010 a federal court upheld new democratic voting procedures for workers in the airline and rail industries who want to form unions. Earlier that year, the National Mediation Board (NMB) issued a new rule that says air and rail union elections must be decided by a majority of votes cast. Previously under the Railway Labor Act, which covers rail and airline workers, every worker who did not cast a vote in a representation election was automatically counted as a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù vote. The Air Transport Association and ten of its member airlines, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the NMB ruling. The court upheld the new rule and denied ATA's (A4A's) request for an injunction. A4A Economic Report and Industry Handbook Since 1937 A4A has released an annual economic report on the U.S. airline industry that includes statistics on operational and financial results for passenger and cargo operations. This report includes data on industry revenue, expenses, traffic, fuel use, safety, economic impact and employment. A4A also publishes a handbook on the airline industry that provides background information on airline economics, operations, safety, security and history. ATA Spec 100: Manufacturers' Technical Data The then Air Transport Association released the newest version of ATA Spec 100 in 1999. According to the A4A website, this information will not be revised and has been combined with ATA Spec 2100 to produce the ATA iSpec 2200: Information Standards for Aviation Maintenance manual. This specification defines a widely used numbering scheme for aircraft parts and the appearance of printed aircraft maintenance information. The Federal Aviation Administration's JASC (Joint Aircraft System/Component) code table provides a modified version of ATA Spec 100\\\\. ATA Spec 100 contains format and content guidelines for technical manuals written by aviation manufacturers and suppliers, and is used by airlines and other segments of the industry in the maintenance of their respective products. This document provides the industrywide standard for aircraft systems numbering, often referred to as the ATA system or ATA chapter numbers. The format and content guidelines define the data prepared as conventional printed documentation. In 2000 ATA Spec 100 and ATA Spec 2100 were incorporated into ATA iSpec 2200: Information Standards for Aviation Maintenance. ATA Spec 100 and Spec 2100 will not be updated beyond the 1999 revision level. ATA Spec 300: Specification for Packaging of Airline Supplies ATA Spec 300 establishes regulations that ensure effective packaging for supplies and equipment shipped by airlines. It stipulates, for example, that a shipping case be able to withstand a minimum of 100 shipments, have durable recessed handles, be coated with non-corrosive products, and have rounded well constructed edges. There has been an increased use of personal luggage that meets the ATA 300 required standards. The ATA Spec 300 was first published on August 1, 1960.

She came to fame as co-lead vocalist of the blues-rock group Stone the Crows,Logan, Nick & Woffinden, Bob (eds.) The New Musical Express Book of Rock, W.H. Allen &Co.; Ltd (Star), 1973, p. 48. . and was described as the UK's closest counterpart to American singer Janis Joplin. Career From a musical family, she sang from her teenage years, leaving school at the age of fifteen, to work as a window dresser by day and singer at night. Bell was introduced to Leslie Harvey, by his older brother Alex, after getting up on stage to sing with the latter. Leslie Harvey was, at that time, a guitarist with the Kinning Park Ramblers. Bell joined the group as one of the vocalists. After the band split up, Bell moved to the Mecca Band at the Sauchiehall Street Locarno, and later to the Dennistoun Palais Band.Logan, Nick & Woffinden, Bob (eds.) The New Musical Express Book of Rock, W.H. Allen &Co.; Ltd (Star), 1973, p. 489. . Power/Stone the Crows She then rejoined Harvey, forming Power initially known as The Power of Music and eventually The Power. Bell and The Power regularly performed at The Easterhouse Project, run by Archie Hind and Graeme Noble. They also toured United States Air Force bases in Germany in the mid 1960s. Peter Grant, who was managing The Yardbirds at the time, heard Power playing at one of these bases and agreed to produce and manage them, impressed by the vocal ability of Bell and the guitar playing of Harvey. Power was then renamed as Stone the Crows, an expression used by Grant upon hearing this band. First solo album Stone the Crows split up in 1973, after Leslie Harvey's accidental death from electrocution on 2 May 1972. Harvey had been an integral part of the band and its music. Peter Grant remained as Bell's manager after the split, and along with Mark London offered to help Bell record a solo album. She subsequently recorded two further albums for Atlantic Records, one produced by Felix Pappalardi and the other produced by Felix Cavaliere. Neither has yet been released.Chris Welch, Liner notes to reissue of Suicide Sal . Retrieved 8 September 2011. Grant then oversaw her first solo album release Queen of the Night (1974), which was recorded in New York City with record producer Jerry Wexler. Swan Song and Midnight Flyer Bell signed to the then newly formed Swan Song Records in 1974, along with Bad Company and Pretty Things, as one of the first signings to the label. Jimmy Page contributed to her second album Suicide Sal (1975). Bell then tried to capture past blues rock glories by fronting Midnight Flyer, who were a popular live act but their sole eponymous album released in 1981 was not a commercial success. Solo again and B. A. Robertson Returning to a solo career, she had her biggest hit in the UK in 1981 duetting with B. A. Robertson on a cover version of \\"Hold Me\\" which reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart. Bell also performed at many charity gigs during this period. Television While working with Stone the Crows, Bell was the subject of a BBC documentary in the 1972 Sounding Out series. Bell sang the end credits theme for the late 1970s ITV detective drama Hazell, with lyrics written by Judy Forrest and music by Andy Mackay. Her song \\"No Mean City\\", written by Mike Moran, was the theme music to the TV crime drama Taggart. She also appeared in a single episode of Taggart called \\"Evil Eye\\" in 1990, playing a gypsy fortune teller named Effie Lambie who is murdered early in the episode. In 1990 she appeared in four episodes of the BBC drama series Your Cheatin‚Äô Heart. In 2009 she provided the singing voice of rock singer Esme Ford (played by Joanna Lumley) in the episode \\"Counter Culture Blues\\" of the ITV series Lewis. Netherlands and The British Blues Quintet After living in the Netherlands for twenty years, Bell returned to the UK in early 2006 and joined The British Blues Quintet, sharing lead vocals with Zoot Money. Also featuring former Stone The Crows drummer Colin Allen and bassist Colin Hodgkinson, the band quickly became established on the UK and European live blues circuit. Their debut album, Live in Glasgow (2007), was recorded at one of their first gigs, on Glasgow's Renfrew Ferry in 2006. In addition, Bell toured with Chris Farlowe in the autumn of 2006 and The Manfreds during 2006 and 2008. In January 2016, the Hamburg Blues Band featuring Maggie Bell and Krissy Matthews, performed at the Quasimodo Club in Berlin, Germany.

It is found in southeastern Florida, the Bahamas, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and probably on other Caribbean islands. Its coloration and habits are unique among butterflies within its range. The Atala is a great example of aposematic (warning) coloration throughout its life cycle. The brightly colored larva or caterpillar feeds on cycads that contain a toxic secondary plant chemical (cycasin) which it retains in its body for life. Birds, lizards, and other animals may attempt to prey on the larva, pupa, and adults, but find them distasteful and learn to avoid these brightly patterned insects. In Florida, the larvae feed on a native cycad, Zamia pumila, commonly called coontie or arrowhead, as well as introduced ornamental cycads. In Cuba, the cycad Cycas revoluta is eaten. Adult butterflies take flower nectar and sometimes roost in trees. Adults fly through much of the year. The natural habitat is open brushy areas and subtropical hammocks, often in pine woodlands. Many populations now exist in suburban areas with ornamental cycads. Adults keep close to a site with host plants, thus the species forms small colonies. The females, however, may disperse in search of more hosts. The butterfly's flight is slow, unlike the swift, erratic flight of many other Lycaenidae. Like many Lepidoptera, male Atalas have hair-pencils (coremata) on their abdomens used in courtship‚Äîthe male hovers in front of the female, wafting pheromones exuded from the pencils in her direction. Eggs are laid in clusters of 10-50 on the leaf tips of the host plant. Larvae feed on the leaves. Pupation is usually on the host plant. The Florida subspecies of this butterfly (Eumaeus atala florida) was at one time believed to have become extinct due to over harvest of its host plant, coontie. It was not collected in Florida from 1937 until 1959. The Atala is now common locally in southeast Florida, rebounding to some extent as it has begun to eat ornamental cycads planted in suburban areas. In Palm Springs, Florida, the G-Star School of the Arts has been contributing to the regrowth of the subspecies.Widom, Gary, \\"Butterfly close to extinction has been found at the G-Star School of the Arts\\", CBS12 News, Palm Springs, Florida, November 3, 2014, - archive link The species was originally described by the Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey. He named the butterfly for Atala, the Native American heroine of an 1801 French novella by Chateaubriand, Atala, ou Les Amours de deux sauvages dans le desert.

A number of figures have been called Y Mab Darogan in history (other titles include Y G≈µr Darogan and Y Daroganwr)Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru, Vol. 1, page 897 (daroganwr); Vol. 2, page 1694 (g≈µr darogan.). An extensive corpus of medieval Welsh prophetic verse, beginning with Armes Prydain (10th century?), is centred on the figure of Y Mab Darogan. Historical figures Arthur Some later poetry associated Y Mab Darogan with the legendary King Arthur. Arthur was often seen as protector figure who defended the Britons against all manner of threats. He is specifically indicated as fighting the Saxons in the 9th-century text Historia Brittonum and in works based on it.Lupack, Alan (Trans.) \\"From: The History of the Britons (Historia Brittonum). The Camelot Project. Retrieved July 20, 2009. However, Arthur does not appear in the Armes Prydain and other early prophetic works. Llywelyn the Great and Llywelyn the Last An awdl by Dafydd Benfras hails 'Llywelyn' as y daroganwr (\\"son of the prophecy\\"; Y Mab Darogan). The poem is difficult to date and may be addressed to either Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great) or his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn the Last); it is accepted with some hesitation as being an ode to Llywelyn ab Iorwerth by the most recent editor in the series Beirdd y Tywysogion, but it is noted that it might well be addressed to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Dafydd Benfras is associated with both). At the end of the ode, which praises Llywelyn as 'king of the Welsh' ('), the poet declaims \\"Whatever is prophesied about you you shall take, / From every prophetic song you shall be blessed, / That which I have prophesied you shall possess, / Whatever I should prophesise you shall uphold, / You are the son of the prophecy in the eyes of all whom you see (about you)!'.N. G. Costigan (ed.), Gwaith Dafydd Benfras ac eraill (University of Wales Press, 1995). 'Mawl Llywelyn ab Iorwerth', lines 53-57, p. 419. Original text: A ddaroganer a gymery, / O bob darogan dawn a geffy, /A ddarogenais a gynyddy, / A ddaroganwyf a gynhely, / Wyt ddaroganwr gan a wely!. Translation source: the editor's paraphrase, in Welsh. Another awdl to Llywelyn the Great by Llywarch ap Llywelyn (Prydydd y Moch) declares that he is the prince who will \\"fulfil the ancient prophecies\\".A. D. Carr, Owen of Wales: The End of the House of Gwynedd (University of Wales Press, 1991), p. 89. Owain Lawgoch In the mid-14th century the mantle of the Mab Darogan passed to Owain Lawgoch (Owain ap Tomas ap Rhodri, 1330‚Äì1378), a descendant of the princes of Gwynedd exiled in France.A. D. Carr, Owen of Wales: The End of the House of Gwynedd (University of Wales Press, 1991), chapter VII 'The Once and Future Prince'. It was in this period that a large body of popular prophetic verse about Y Mab Darogan began to circulate, often referring to him as \\"Owain\\". Many of these poems are difficult to date and often appear in variant versions suggesting adaptation over a period of time within the oral poetic tradition. It is therefore unclear in most cases whether \\"Owain\\" refers to Owain Lawgoch or Owain Glynd≈µr or even some other, future hero. A poem attributed to Rhys Fardd refers to 'Owain' and 'fighting in Calais'. Another, attributed to Y Bergam, seems to refer to Owain Lawgoch in the lines \\"And there is a man in France eager for battle / who will avenge his father with a whole army.\\"A. D. Carr, Owen of Wales: The End of the House of Gwynedd (University of Wales Press, 1991), p. 90. Original text: Ac y mae gwr yn ffraink ffrowddos kyffrank / a ddial i dad o gad gyfan. Translation by the author. Gruffudd ap Maredudd ap Dafydd (fl. 1352-82) composed an awdl which urges Owain to return from France to liberate Wales and conquer England.Welsh Biography on-line, National Library of Wales Another prophecy addressed to Owain Lawgoch is attributed to Iolo Goch but not recognised as his work. A poem by an anonymous poet, written after the murder of Owain in France by an English agent, suggests that many Welshmen were expecting him and that steeds and arms had been prepared for his coming: \\"Watching the beaches in (our) youth, // Buying swift steeds... // And arms ready for battle. / But then coldness came upon us, / Though we looked for Rhodri's grandson. / We lamented when he came not: / He was slain, killed by a dastard.\\"Elissa R. Henken National redeemer: Owain Glynd≈µr in Welsh tradition (University of Wales Press, 1996) p. 50. Original text: Gwiliaw traethau yn ieufanc / Gorllanw ffrwyth gorllwyn Ffrainc /Prynu meirch glud hybarch glod /Ac arfau ar fedr gorfod / Yn √¥l oiri yr aeth ini /Er edrych am ≈µyr Rodri / Llyna och ym lle ni chawdd / Lleddid, a diawl a'i lladdawdd The epithet llawgoch itself may be significant. It can be understood literally ('red hand') and is a suitable adjective to describe a heroic warrior, but attention has been drawn to evidence from medieval Ireland which suggests that a red mark on the hand was regarded as a messianic symbol, e.g. in the case of Cathal Crobderg ('Red Hand'), king of Connacht (d. 1224).James Carney, 'Literature in Irish, 1169-1534' in Art Cosgrove (ed.), Medieval Ireland 1169-1534, quoted by A.D. Carr in Owen of Wales, p. 119n. Owain Glynd≈µr Owain Glynd≈µr was a prince descended from the Kings of Powys who led a revolt against English rule in Wales between 1400 and 1415. His forces even pushed into England and came close to achieving his goal of Welsh independence. He was called Y Mab Darogan in his own day but was ultimately defeated and subsequently disappeared. Henry VII In the lead up to the Welshman Henry Tudor seizing the throne of England by defeating and slaying Richard III at Bosworth Field in 1485, his supporters and the poets of Wales claimed him as Y Mab Darogan, a move that won the future king many supporters in Wales. He landed in southwest Wales and raised the banner of Cadwaladr, a Welsh king often mentioned in the prophecies as returning with Cynan to free the Brythons ‚Äì before marching through the country to gather recruits on his way to Bosworth. His reign over England was believed by some to be the fulfilment of the prophecy; a belief that he actively encouraged by naming his firstborn son Arthur Tudor. Prince Arthur came of age as Prince of Wales in 1501 and after marrying governed the Principality from its de facto capital at Ludlow and reversed some of the most oppressive laws established in Wales at the defeat of Owain Glyndwr. However, he died only one year later and Britain never saw another king named Arthur. His younger brother Henry became Prince of Wales but this son had been brought up in London. Henry succeeded his father to the throne as King Henry VIII: like his father, Henry VIII used the red dragon as a supporter to his royal arms and he enacted the Laws in Wales Acts of 1536 and 1543 by which the legal system in Wales was united with that of the Kingdom of England, and Wales was given parliamentary representation and equality under the law. Henry abolished the feudal marcher lordships which hitherto had ruled much of southern and western Wales and the medi√¶val laws applying there.

Opened in July 2000, it houses a museum exhibiting the role of Nebraska and the Platte River Valley in the development of America. The monument spans more than 300 feet above Interstate 80 and is accessible via two numbered exits (275 and 272). History A monument and tourist attraction highlighting the history of the Platte River Valley was a goal of former Governor Frank B. Morrison. In 1997, $60 million in bonds were issued and purchased by investors. On 16 July 2000, the Archway opened to the public, with 223,013 and 249,174 visitors in the attraction's first two years, respectively. First-year visitors included then- president Bill Clinton. These numbers were far short of projections. The monument had to reduce expenses and refinance its bond payments in 2002, reducing the amount owed to $22 million, repaid by 2013. While a shift in focus on educational and group tours briefly presented the monument with a more stable financial footing, attendance subsequently dwindled, counting only 49,960 visitors in 2012. The Archway filed for bankruptcy protection on March 7, 2013. In September 2013, U.S. federal bankruptcy judge Thomas Saladino approved a debt plan, ordering museum organizers to pay $100,000 as a settlement for more than $20 million it owed to bondholders, creditors and vendors. Wells Fargo Bank of Minneapolis was the trustee for the bondholders. As part of the resolution of the bankruptcy filing, The Archway is managed by the City of Kearney. I-80 Exit 275, adjacent to the Archway, was completed in August 2013 directly east of the museum at a cost of about $20 million. In December 2013, the museum announced a two-month closure to re-brand itself following its debt ruling, scheduling its grand re-opening for March 1, 2014. The Archway re-opened on March 1, 2014. Changes include a revamped gift shop and a new theater that shows short videos that pertain to subjects featured in the historical exhibit. Archie the Buffalo, a new mascot was introduced. In January 2018, the Archway announced that the organization earned a profit for the first time in its history in 2017. Exhibit overview Since prehistoric times, the trail along the Platte River through Nebraska, which came to be known as the Great Platte River Road, has been a thoroughfare for travel across the continent. The Archway museum details the stories of the pioneers, adventurers, and innovators who have traveled the trail since the mid-1800s and helped to build America. The exhibit starts at Fort Kearny in 1848 and features sections on the Oregon Trail, California Trail, and Mormon Trail that converged at the nearby Fort Kearny before heading west. As visitors progress through the exhibit, the displays of different time periods feature a prairie schooner wagon on the Oregon Trail, a buffalo stampede, the Mormon Handcart Expedition, a 49er's campsite, the Pony Express, the Transcontinental Telegraph, a stagecoach, the Transcontinental Railroad, the first transcontinental highway, the Lincoln Highway, and today's transcontinental highway, I-80. The exhibit ends with a replica drive-in and 1950s-style cafe with windows providing views over the interstate. The exhibits are featured in chronological order and reflect the historical developments that occurred on the Great Platte River Road. In popular culture *The Archway Monument was one of the locations used in the filming of About Schmidt (2002), starring Jack Nicholson.

In England and Wales, a common practice is to prefer a charge of murder, with the judge or defence able to introduce manslaughter as an option (see lesser included offence). The jury then decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of either murder or manslaughter. On conviction for manslaughter, sentencing is at the judge's discretion, whereas a sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory on conviction for murder. Manslaughter may be either voluntary or involuntary, depending on whether the accused has the required mens rea for murder. Voluntary manslaughter Voluntary manslaughter occurs when the defendant kills with mens rea (an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm), but one of those partial defences which reduce murder to manslaughter applies (these consist of mitigating circumstances which reduce the defendant's culpability). The original mitigating factors were provocation and chance medley which existed at common law, but the former has been abolished by statute, the latter has been held no longer to existR v Semini [1949] 1 KB 405, 33 Cr App R 51, CCA and new defences have been created by statute. The Homicide Act 1957 now provides two defences which may be raised to allow the court to find the accused guilty of voluntary manslaughter: diminished responsibility and suicide pact. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 creates the defence of \\"loss of control\\". Diminished responsibility Under section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 there are three requirements for the defendant to raise the defence of diminished responsibility. The defendant must have suffered from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing caused by one of the causes specified by the Act which substantially impaired the defendant's mental responsibility for the killing. Under section 2(2) of the Act it is for the defendant to prove he suffered from such a condition on the balance of probabilities. Abnormality of mind An abnormality of mind has been defined by Lord Parker CJ \\"as state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal\\".R v Byrne [1960] 2 QB 396 In deciding whether this state of mind exists the jury should consider medical evidence, but also all other evidence including acts and statements of the accused and his demeanour. The jury does not have to accept the medical evidence if other material conflicts with and outweighs it. Specified causes The Homicide Act specifies three causes one of which must cause the abnormality; they are a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind, any inherent cause or a disease or injury. Whether the abnormality is caused by one of the specified causes is a matter for medical evidence alone. Alcoholism is capable of being an abnormality of mind even if there is no physical damage to the brain.R v Wood [2009] 1 W.L.R. 496 Substantial impairment of mental responsibility Whether the abnormality substantially impaired the defendant's mental responsibility for the killing is a question of degree for the jury. In R v Lloyd the Court of Appeal held that the lack of control must simply be ‚Äòmore than trivial‚Äô.[1967] 1 Q.B. 175 at 177 Premenstrual tension (PMT) has been accepted as a mitigating factor in several high-profile cases. In 1980, Sandie Smith was convicted of manslaughter for stabbing a barmaid. Dr. Katharina Dalton who examined Smith before the trial diagnosed her with severe PMS. This diagnosis was accepted as a cause of diminished responsibility. Smith was sentenced to three years probation despite previous convictions for violent behavior. Loss of control See Loss of control (defence). It is a defence to murder, if accepted or plea-bargained, resulting in manslaughter by reason of loss of control. Suicide pacts Section 4(1) of the Homicide Act 1957 introduced the defence of suicide pact. Parliament's intention was to show some compassion for those who had been involved in a suicide pact but failed to die. Section 4(3) defines a suicide pact as \\"a common agreement between two or more persons having for its object the death of all of them, whether or not each is to take his own life\\". Further the accused must have had a \\"settled intention of dying in pursuance of the pact\\" to avoid the accused entering into a supposed pact with the real intention of committing murder. The Law Commission has proposed abolishing the defence with deserving cases falling within diminished responsibility,Law Commission Consultation Paper No. 177, A New Homicide Act for England and Wales but feels it should be retained pending a review of a new partial defence of mercy killings.Law Commission Report No. 304, Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide Involuntary manslaughter Involuntary manslaughter arises where the accused did not intend to cause death or serious injury but caused the death of another through recklessness or criminal negligence. For these purposes, recklessness is defined as a blatant disregard for the dangers of a particular situation. An example of this would be dropping a brick off a bridge, landing on a person's head, killing them. Since the intent is not to kill the victim, but simply to drop the brick, the mens rea required for murder does not exist because the act is not aimed at any one person. But if in dropping the brick, there is a good chance of injuring someone, the person who drops it will be reckless. This form of manslaughter is also termed \\"unlawful act\\" or \\"constructive\\" manslaughter. Manslaughter by gross negligence Under English law, where a person owes a duty of care (either by statute or by the neighbour principleDonoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562) and is negligent to such a degree that consequently the law regards it as a crimeR v Evans [2009] EWCA Crim 650 (namely the person has been grossly negligent) and that person causes the victim to die, they may be liable for gross negligence manslaughter.R v Adomako [1995] 1 AC 171 The defendants in such cases are often people carrying out jobs that require special skills or care, such as doctors, teachers, police or prison officers, or electricians, who fail to meet the standard which could be expected from a reasonable person of the same profession.AG's Reference (No. 2 of 1999) [2000] QB 796 (Court of Appeal) In R v BatemanR v Bateman (1925) 19 Cr App R 8, (1925) ? Cox 33, [1925] All ER Rep 45, CCA. For an explanation of these abbreviations see Case citation. the Court of Criminal Appeal held that gross negligence manslaughter involved the following elements: #the defendant owed a duty to the deceased to take care; #the defendant breached this duty; #the breach caused the death of the deceased; and #the defendant's negligence was gross, that is, it showed such a disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime and deserve punishment. The House of Lords in SeymourR v Seymour [1983] 2 AC 493, [1983] 3 WLR 349, [1983] 2 All ER 1058, 77 Cr App R 215, [1983] RTR 455, [1983] Crim LR 742, HL, affirming 76 Cr App R 211, CA sought to identify the mens rea for \\"motor manslaughter\\" (negligently causing death when driving a motor vehicle). Reference was made to R v Caldwell and R v LawrenceR v Caldwell [1982] AC 341, HLR v Lawrence [1982] AC 510, [1981] 2 WLR 524, 73 Cr App R 1, [1981] 1 All ER 974, [1981] RTR 217, [1981] Crim LR 409, HL, reversing 71 Cr App R 291 which held that a person was reckless if: #he did an act which in fact created an obvious and serious risk of injury to the person or substantial damage to property; and #when he did the act he either had not given any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or had recognised that there was some risk involved and had nonetheless gone on to do it. The conclusion was that for motor manslaughter (and, by implication, for all cases of gross negligence), it was more appropriate to adopt this definition of recklessness. Consequently, if the defendant created an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to someone, there could be liability whether there was simple inadvertence or conscious risk-taking. It was no longer a defence to argue that the negligence had not been gross. In R v AdomakoR v Adamoko [1995] 1 AC 171, [1994] 3 WLR 288, [1994] 3 All ER 79, 99 Cr App R 362, HL an anaesthetist failed to notice that a tube had become disconnected from the ventilator and the patient died. Lord Mackay disapproved Seymour and held that the Bateman test of gross negligence was the appropriate test in manslaughter cases involving a breach of duty, allowing the jury to consider the accused's conduct in all the surrounding circumstances, and to convict only if the negligence was very serious. Individuals have a duty to act in the following situations: *to care for certain defined classes of helpless relatives, e.g. spouses must take care of each other, and parents must look after their dependent children. In R v Stone and DobinsonR v Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB 354, 64 Cr App R 186, [1977] 2 WLR 169, [1977] 2 All ER 341, [1977] Crim LR 166, CA an elderly woman with anorexia nervosa came to stay with her brother and his cohabitee, who were both of low intelligence, and subsequently starved herself to death. The Court of Appeal held that the question whether the couple owed a duty to care for the deceased was a question of fact for the jury, which was entitled to take into account the facts that she was a relative of one of the appellants, that she was occupying a room in his house, and that the other appellant had undertaken the duty to care for her by trying to wash her and taking food to her. *where there is a contract (even if the person injured was outside the contractual relationship and, in the civil law would be barred by privity from enforcing the contract). In R v Pittwood 1902 TLR 37, a railway crossing gatekeeper had opened the gate to let a cart pass and forgot to shut it again. Later a hay cart was struck by a train while crossing. He was convicted of manslaughter. It was argued on his behalf that he owed a duty only to his employers, the railway company, with whom he had contracted. Wright J, held, however, that the man was paid to keep the gate shut and protect the public so had a duty to act. In contracts relating both to employment and to the provision of services, R v YaqoobR v Yaqoob 2005 EWCA Crim 1269 considered a partner in a taxi firm who was responsible for making all necessary arrangements for the inspection and maintenance of a minibus which had overturned after its tyre burst, killing one of its passengers. He was convicted of manslaughter because the failure properly to maintain the minibus was the direct cause of the accident and there was an implied duty owed both to other members of the partnership and to those renting the vehicle, to inspect and maintain beyond the standard required for an MOT test, council inspections, and other duties imposed by regulation. The jury was competent to assess whether the failure to discharge that implied duty was gross negligence without hearing any expert evidence; these were not technical issues and they did not need expert help. The sentence of four years imprisonment was within the sentencing band and not excessive. In Attorney- General's Reference (No 2 of 1999),Attorney-General's Reference (No 2 of 1999) 2000 3 AER 182 a case on corporate manslaughter that arose out of the Southall rail crash, the Court of Appeal decided the defendant's subjective state of mind (i.e. whether there was conscious risk-taking) is irrelevant and, therefore, so is the question of recklessness, leaving the objective test as the only test for liability. Rose LJ said: Civil negligence rules are not apt to confer criminal liability; the identification principle remains the only basis in common law for corporate liability for gross negligence manslaughter (see imputation). This was the only persuasive authority for the law of manslaughter at large, but R v DPP, ex parte Jones,R v DPP, ex parte Jones 2000 (QBD) IRLR 373 which said that the test of negligent manslaughter is objective, confirmed Attorney General's Reference (No 2 of 1999) as a correct general statement of law. Death by dangerous driving Because of a reluctance by juries to convict when the charge was manslaughter, a statutory offence of \\"causing death by dangerous driving\\" was introduced. Following the Road Traffic Law Review Committee (1988), the Road Traffic Act 1991 abandoned recklessness in favour of the pre-statutory objective test of \\"dangerousness\\", i.e. did the driving fall far below the standard of the competent and careful driver. The Committee also recommended that manslaughter should be an optional charge for the more serious driving cases. There is the possibility of charging an aggravated taking without consent for less seriously dangerous driving where death results. An equivalent, in many American states, to motor manslaughter is vehicular homicide. An equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving in Canada under the Criminal Code is causing death by criminal negligence. Manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act Under English law, according to R v Creamer,R v Creamer [1966] 1 QB 72, 49 Cr App R 368, [1965] 3 WLR 583, [1965] 3 All ER 257, CCA a person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when he or she intends an unlawful act that is likely to do harm to the person, and death results which was neither foreseen nor intended. The name for this crime is 'manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act' (MUDA). The term 'constructive manslaughter' is commonly and correctly used as a synonym. Although the accused did not intend to cause serious harm or foresee the risk of doing so, and although an objective observer would not necessarily have predicted that serious harm would result, the accused's responsibility for causing death is constructed from the fault in committing what might have been a minor criminal act. The case of R v Goodfellow(1986) 83 Cr App R 23, per Lord Lane CJ at p.27 laid out a four-part requirement which if satisfied could lead to liability for MUDA. The person's action must: # Be intentional # Be unlawful # Lead the reasonable person to realise that some other person is at risk of physical harm # Be the cause of death A number of authorities clarify the test from R v Goodfellow: * As to (1): either did the person intend to bring about the commission of the offence,R v Mohan [1976] QB 1 or was the outcome a virtual certainty that the person knew was a virtual certainty?.R v Woollin [1999] 1 AC 82 If the answer to either of these questions is yes then the person's action was intentional. * As to (2): a full 'base offence' must be established, or else there can be no liability for MUDA.R v Lamb [1967] 2 QB 981 * As to (3): the test is one of objective reasonableness and is a question for the jury to determine (i.e. to answer the question: \\"Would a reasonable person realise that the defendant's act was bound to subject some other person to the risk of physical harm?\\") * As to (4): was the act a cause in fact and in law? (see Causation (law) for details) In R v Dawson,R v Dawson (1985) 81 Cr App R 150, CA a petrol station attendant with a weak heart died of heart failure when the appellant attempted a robbery of the station. In judging whether this act was sufficiently dangerous, the Court of Appeal applied a test based on the \\"sober and reasonable\\" bystander who could be assumed to know that the use of a replica gun was likely to terrify people and so be a danger to those with a weak heart. Note the aggravated form of criminal damage with intent to endanger life under section 1(2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 which could provide the unlawful act if the damage actually causes death. But R v Carey, C and FR v Carey, C and F 2006 EWCA Crim 17 limits the scope of unlawful act manslaughter. An argument became violent and the first defendant punched and kicked one victim. The second defendant assaulted the deceased by pulling her hair back and punching her in the face. The third defendant assaulted another. The deceased was one of the first to run away, after which she felt faint, and later died of a heart condition (ventricular fibrillation or dysrhythmia) which was congenital but which had not been diagnosed before her death. The unlawful act was said to be the affray and the judge held that it was legitimate to aggregate the violence by the other defendants in order to decide whether the affray had subjected the deceased to the threat of at least some physical harm, and so had been a cause of death. On appeal, it was inappropriate to hold the defendants liable for the death. There must be an unlawful act that was dangerous in the sense that sober and reasonable persons would recognise that the act was such as to subject Y to the risk of physical harm. In turn, that act must cause the death. When deciding whether an act is dangerous, knowledge of the victim's characteristics may be relevant. In this case, no reasonable person would have been aware of the victim's heart condition which distinguishes this case from Dawson, and from R v WatsonR v Watson [1989] 1 WLR 684 in which the victim's approximate age (he was 87 years old) and frail state would have been obvious to a reasonable person. A sober and reasonable person would not have foreseen that an apparently healthy person of 15 years would suffer shock as a result of it. The court held that the deceased's death was not caused by injuries that were a foreseeable result of the affray. The assault by the second defendant was an unlawful act causing death. The other two defendants could have been convicted by virtue of common purpose given that the death was an accidental departure from the general plan of the affray. But the Crown did not elect to present the case in this way, but pleaded the case as a public order group activity. The result would be that if anyone died in a general disturbance amounting to an affray, all those who participated could be convicted of manslaughter which would be against public policy. Deaths in a general disturbance are too remote to be caused by all participants. Thus, a punch which causes a person to fall will almost inevitably satisfy the test of dangerousness, and where the victim falls and suffers a fatal head injury the accused is guilty of manslaughter. It is foreseeable that the victim is at risk of suffering some physical harm (albeit not serious harm) from such a punch and that is sufficient. Physical harm includes shock. The reason why the death resulting from the attempted robbery of the 60-year-old petrol station attendant was not manslaughter was that the attempted robbery was not dangerous in the relevant sense. It was not foreseeable that an apparently healthy 60-year-old man would suffer shock and a heart attack as a result of such an attempted robbery. But the jury properly found that it was foreseeable that an obviously frail and very old man was at risk of suffering shock leading to a heart attack as a result of a burglary committed at his home late at night. In R v Charles James Brown,R v Charles James Brown 2005 EWCA Crim 2868 following the break-up of his relationship with his girlfriend, at about 3 pm., the defendant sent a text message to his mother saying that he did not want to live any more. He then drove his car against the flow of traffic along the hard shoulder of the A1(M) at high speed, before moving into the carriageway, still accelerating and straddling the centre line. He then crashed, head on, into an oncoming car, killing the passenger and injuring many others in the resulting consequential crashes. A sentence of 10 years' detention in a young offender institution was upheld because although the intentional focus might have been only on suicide, the defendant must have known from the way he was driving that he would kill or injure at least one other person (thus enforcing an objective standard on the defendant). Unlawful (constructive) act manslaughter and the liability imposed on drug suppliers The law on those who supply the (post) deceased with drugs had been uncertain until the case of R v Kennedy.R v Kennedy 2007 UKHL 38 The defendant supplied heroin to a drug user that asked for something to help them sleep. An hour after administering the drug the victim died. Kennedy was found guilty of manslaughter and appealed on the grounds that there must be an unlawful act which caused the victim's death. In this case the defendant set up the drug and supplied it but did not administer it, therefore it was an act of the victim himself that caused his own death. Kennedy was acquitted of manslaughter. Prior to this House of Lords ruling, the lower courts (in particular the Court of Appeal) struggled to strike a balance between those suppliers considered to have administered the drug (in the subsequent cases, heroin) to the victim themselves, and those suppliers who simply \\"supply\\" the drug for the victim to then voluntarily administer themselves. Defence Infanticide is a partial defence to manslaughter under the Infanticide Act 1938 (as amended by section 57 the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to confirm the decision in R v GoreR v Gore [2007] EWCA Crim 2789) and reduces the manslaughter to the crime of infanticide. Mode of trial and sentence Manslaughter is an indictable-only offence. A person guilty of manslaughter is liable to imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.Offences against the Person Act 1861 (24 & 25 Vict. c.100), section 5; Criminal Justice Act 1948 (11 & 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(1) For case law on sentencing see the Crown Prosecution Service sentencing manual: *Involuntary manslaughter *Manslaughter ‚Äì diminished responsibility *Manslaughter ‚Äì provocation *Manslaughter ‚Äì suicide pact Attempt In R v Creamer, the court said obiter that attempted manslaughter is not an offence known to law.R v Creamer [1966] 1 QB 72 at 81, 49 Cr App R 368 at 378, CCA History Voluntary manslaughter ‚Äì former partial defence of provocation Provocation in English law was abolished on 4 October 2010The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2010 (S.I. 2010/816 (C. 56)), article 6(b); and see here by section 56(1) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, but replaced by the similar partial defence of \\"loss of control\\". Acts constituting provocation At common law, acts of provocation had to be actual violence towards the defendant; words could not amount to provocation. The two exceptions to this rule were a husband discovering his wife committing adultery and a father finding someone buggering his son. There were two limbs to the defence, first the defendant had to have actually been provoked, and second the provocation had to be such as would have made the reasonable man act as the defendant did. The Homicide Act 1957 removed all limits on what could amount to provocation and allowed it to include provocation from someone other than the victim,R v Davies [1975] QB 691 and aimed at someone other than the accused.R v Pearson [1992] Crim LR 193 Further the defence was not defeated by the fact that the defendant induced the provocation.Edwards v R [1973] AC 648 Section 56 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 states that the common law defence of provocation is abolished and replaced by sections 54 and 55; and that section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957 is also abolished and replaced with sections 54 and 55. Subjective limb: provocation in fact This was a question of fact for the jury. The loss of control had to be sudden and temporary,R v Duffy [1946] 1 All ER 932n however it could be the result of slow burn; the final straw needed not be very bad as long as it led to an actual sudden and temporary loss of control. A delay between the act of provocation and the killing did not always defeat the defence, but often would.R v Ahluwalia [1992] 4 All ER 889 Objective limb: the reasonable man test Under section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957 the second question to be answered by the jury in order for the defence to succeed was ‚Äòwhether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man act as [the defendant] did?‚Äô. The reasonable man for the purposes of this test had the same sex and age as the defendant and shared such characteristics as affect the gravity of the provocation to the defendant, but characteristics irrelevant to the provocation such as unrelated mental disorders were not given to the reasonable man.A-G for Jersey v Holley [2005] UKPC 23, as affirmed in R v James and Karimi [2006] EWCA Crim 14 Finally, the reasonable man always had reasonable powers of self-controlR v Lesbini [1914] 3 KB 1116 and was never intoxicated.R v Newell (1980) 71 Cr App R 331 See also *English criminal law *Infanticide *Suicide Act 1961 Notes References *Gardner, Simon.

Directed by documentary filmmaker Bill Day, the film revealed the inside story of Veitch's life and her struggle to start a ministry for women in the sex industry. The film primarily focuses on Veitch, along with the team of Christian women who join her to become JC's Girls, and Pastor Matt Brown of Sandals Church in Riverside, California. The film highlights the pastor's efforts to support Veitch's endeavor, while facing opposition from his local congregation.  Private life  Veitch was born in Los Angeles but grew up in Muscoy, San Bernardino County. She has two children.

Whalen was a member of the Republican Party who served in the Ohio House of Representatives, Ohio State Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. In his six terms in the U.S. House, Whalen established himself in the liberal wing of the Republican Party and led opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Early life Born in Dayton, Ohio, Whalen graduated from Oakwood High School, from the University of Dayton with a degree in business administration in 1942, and from Harvard University Graduate School of Business in 1946. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War II and was discharged as a first lieutenant in 1946. After his discharge from the service, he worked at his father‚Äôs company, Dayton Dress Company as a vice president from 1946 to 1952, and was a professor of economics and chairman of the department at the University of Dayton from 1962 to 1966. Ohio state legislator In 1954, Whalen was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives where he served for three terms until his election to the Ohio State Senate in 1960. He served three terms in the Senate before entering Congress. In 1962, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. In a crowded primary, his main opponent in the race was John Brown, a former two-term Lieutenant Governor who also served as Governor for 11 days after the resignation of Frank Lausche. Whalen finished second taking 15.8% of the vote in the six-way primary. As a Senator, Whalen fought for a Fair Housing Law in Ohio. U.S. representative Whalen next ran for Congress in 1966. During the election, he walked 880 miles around his district to meet voters. In the general election, he defeated freshman incumbent Rodney Love with 53.8% of the vote. In five more races, Whalen was never seriously challenged. He won 78% of the vote in 1968, a year when Hubert H. Humphrey won his district. He followed that in 1970 and 1972 with 76% and 74%, respectively. In 1974, a year that the Republicans faced fallout from the Watergate scandal, he was the only Republican with no challengers in the primary or general election. Whalen had a liberal voting record in the House. In 1967, he and four other Republicans authored a position paper ‚ÄúHow to End the Draft: The Case for an All-Volunteer Army‚Äù and introduced legislation to end the draft. He was also an opponent of the Vietnam War who supported legislation to reduce the military budget and to introduce a timetable for the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam. In 1971, he and Lucien Nedzi introduced the Nedzi-Whalen Amendment to a military procurement bill that would have prohibited the use of funds for the bill to be used in Southeast Asia after the end of 1971. In his final term, he supported efforts to eliminate the B-1 bomber program. In 1973, Whalen authored the book \\"Your Right to Know: How the Free Flow of News Depends on the Journalist's Right to Protect His Sources,\\" which has an introduction written by Walter Cronkite. His voting record increasingly put him at odds with his own party. Congressional Quarterly estimated that, in 1974, he voted against the majority of his party members 72% of the time. In 1977, he acknowledged that he had spoken with the Democratic Party leadership about switching parties. While Ohio state law would have made this difficult, he also considered running as an independent in 1978. Ultimately, he decided not to run for re-election in 1978. Whalen was succeeded by Democrat Tony P. Hall. After he left Congress, Whalen switched his party registration to Democratic. Later life After his retirement from Congress, Whalen authored two books with his wife Barbara, a former columnist for the Dayton Journal Herald and the voice of Elsie the Cow. The first, \\"The Longest Debate: A Legislative History of the 1964 Civil Rights Act\\", chronicled the legislative process behind the passage of the Civil Rights Act. His second book, \\"The Fighting McCooks ‚Äì America's Famous Fighting Family\\", discussed a local family with a long military history. Whalen died in Bethesda, Maryland on June 27, 2011. He was 90.

Following this, in 2010, TVM was rebranded as MNBC One, and Dhivehiraajjeyge Adu [Voice of Maldives] was renamed as Raajje Radio. Maldives National Broadcasting Corporation (MNBC) recently rebranded the name of Television Maldives (TVM) to \\"MNBC One.\\" Under the rebranding process, the company also changed the name of Voice of Maldives (VOM) to \\"Raajje Radio.\\" The move came days after Maldives Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) formed under Maldives Broadcasting Corporation Act announced that all the assets, employees, and land used by state media organisations belong to the company and MNBC was using the assets against law.

Biography John Sigvard Olsen was born in Peru, Indiana on November 6, 1892, the son of a Norwegian immigrant, Gustav Olsen, a boiler-maker for the railroad, and his wife, Catherine, who was of Swiss- German descent. He graduated from Northwestern University in 1912 with a degree in music and hit the Vaudeville circuit. In 1914 he met Chic Johnson, who was advertising himself as the \\"Greatest Ragtime Pianist in the Midwest\\". The two performers met when they were hired as musicians in the same band. When the band broke up \\"Ole\\" Olsen and \\"Chic\\" Johnson formed the Olsen and Johnson comedy team. They really did not have a set act but found themselves booked into a small Chicago nightclub as part of Mike Fritzol's Frolics. When it came time for their turn in the show, unannounced and not particularly welcome, the duo pushed a piano onstage. Johnson seated himself at the keyboard and began to plunk out a ragtime tune. Olsen joined in with his violin and started singing, making up comical lyrics as he went along. The pair began to exchange \\"patter\\", mostly insults, and the soon-to-be-famous \\"Olsen and Johnson\\" team emerged. They performed in Vaudeville, as well as making some film appearances, for 24 years before hitting Broadway in 1938 with the show Hellzapoppin', later successfully filmed. Ole Olsen was married twice. He had three children with his first wife, Lillian: J. C., Joy, and Moya. They were later divorced. His son, J. C., died by suicide. Moya married William P. Lear of Learjet fame in 1942. Ole was involved in a serious automobile accident in 1950 and recuperated at the Lear home. In June 1961 Ole married Eileen Maria Osthoff, a dancer and choreographer he had known for eight years. Ole's ambition was to make people laugh. He is remembered for the quote, \\"May you live as long as you laugh, and laugh as long as you live\\", which are cited on his headstone. Olsen died in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the age of 70 of a kidney ailment, and is interred in Palm Desert Memorial in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a grave adjoining that of Chic Johnson.

AASM comprises a frontal guidance kit and a rear-mounted range extension kit matched to a dumb bomb. The weapon is modular because it can integrate different types of guidance units and different types of bombs. The basic version features a bomb plus hybrid inertial navigation system (INS) / Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance. Other variants add infrared homing or laser guidance to increase accuracy; there are also versions with , or bomb bodies. It entered service in 2007 with the French Air Force and Naval Aviation, from Rafale and Mirage 2000. In 2011, AASM was given the name HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range). Chosen for commercial reasons, the English acronym is also used in French. The French pronunciation of \\"AASM\\" was deux-A-S-M or A-deux-S-M.  Development  The program started in 1997, when the D√©l√©gation G√©n√©rale pour l'Armement (DGA), the French defense procurement agency, launched an international competition on the design for the weapon. In 2000, a contract was awarded to SAGEM for an initial lot of AASM GPS/INS bomb kits, expected at the time to be delivered from 2004 and to enter service the following year.Nick Cook, \\"Europe sees technology as key: requirements in Europe are currently centred on the RAF's Precision Guided Bomb programme\\".

Cost  According to French Senate's Comit√© des Prix de Revient des fabrications d'Armement (CPRA) cited by the daily La Tribune, the total cost of the AASM program including development costs and the delivery of 2348 kits is ‚Ç¨846m.

On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved. The 2012 defence budget presented to the Senate reported the project had cost ‚Ç¨592.2m (~US$800m) with a unit cost of ‚Ç¨164,000, or ‚Ç¨252,000 including development costs.  Variants  AASM comes in several variants according to its size and the type of guidance used. * The current model features a 250 kg bomb matched to a nose-mounted guidance kit and a rear-mounted range extension kit, containing a rocket booster and enlarged fins. There is also a 125 kg, first tested in 2009, and a proposed 1000 kg version. * As for guidance, the basic version combines data from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and an inertial navigation system (INS) unit through Kalman filtering, achieving a circular error probability (CEP). This \\"decametric\\" all-weather variant is complemented by a \\"metric\\" day/night fair weather version which adds infrared homing (IIR) guidance that matches the target area with a target model stored in its memory for a CEP. * A third version uses laser guidance instead of IIR allowing it to hit moving targets with more precision.\\"France‚Äôs AASM Precision-Guided Bombs\\".

Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006), is a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that without a search warrant, police had no constitutional right to search a house where one resident consents to the search while another resident objects. The Court distinguished this case from the \\"co-occupant consent rule\\" established in United States v. Matlock, , which permitted one resident to consent in absence of the co-occupant. Background Respondent Scott Randolph and his wife, Janet Randolph, separated in late May 2001, when she left the marital residence in Americus, Georgia, and went to stay with her parents in Canada, taking their son and some belongings. In July, she returned to the Americus house with the child; the record does not register her motive for returning. On the morning of July 6, she complained to the police that, after a domestic dispute, her husband had taken their son from the marital residence, and when the police reached the Randolph house, she told them that her husband was a cocaine user whose drug use habit had caused the family financial troubles. She mentioned the marital problems, saying that she and their son had only recently returned after a several weeks' stay with her parents. Shortly after the policemen arrived, Scott Randolph returned, explaining to them that he had removed their son to a neighbor's house, worried that his wife might again take the boy out of the U.S.; Scott Randolph denied using cocaine, and countered that it was his wife, Janet, who used illegal drugs and abused alcohol. One of the policemen, Sergeant Murray, went with Janet Randolph to reclaim the Randolph child from the neighbor; when they returned, she renewed her complaints about her husband's drug use and volunteered that there were ‚Äúitems of drug evidence‚Äù in the house. Sergeant Murray asked Scott Randolph for permission to search the house; he refused. The sergeant then asked Janet Randolph's consent to search the Randolph house, which she readily gave, and then led him to an upstairs bedroom she identified as Scott's, where the sergeant noticed a section of a drinking straw with a powder residue he suspected was cocaine. He then left the house to get an evidence bag from his patrol car, and to call the district attorney's office, which instructed him to stop the search and apply for a search warrant. When Sergeant Murray returned to the house, Janet Randolph withdrew her consent to searching the house. The police took the drinking straw to the police station, along with the arrested occupants. After obtaining a search warrant, they returned to the Randolph house and seized further evidence of illegal drug use, on the basis of which Scott Randolph was indicted for possession of cocaine. At court, Scott Randolph moved to suppress the evidence, as products of a warrantless search of his house, unauthorized by his wife's consent over his express refusal. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that Janet Randolph had \\"common authority\\" to consent to the search. Opinion of the Court In a 5-3 opinion written by Justice Souter, the Court held a co- resident could refuse consent to a police search, even if another resident consented.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 163 (2006). Specifically: > The question here is whether such an evidentiary seizure is likewise lawful > with the permission of one occupant when the other, who later seeks to > suppress the evidence, is present at the scene and expressly refuses to > consent. We hold that, in the circumstances here at issue, a physically > present co- occupant's stated refusal to permit entry prevails, rendering > the warrantless search unreasonable and invalid as to him. The Court's decision distinguished its previous rulings in Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177 (1990) and Matlock. In Rodriguez and Matlock the police obtained voluntary consent from a co-occupant at the residence and found evidence implicating another resident who was not present when the police obtained consent. The Court said that the present case was different from the previous two in that the co-resident was not present to refuse consent to the search. In Rodriguez the co-occupant who later objected to the search was asleep in a bedroom within the residence; in Matlock, the later- objecting co-occupant was located in a nearby police vehicle. Justice Alito, who had yet to be confirmed when the case was argued, did not participate in the argument or decision of the case. Justice Stevens's concurrence Justices Stevens and Breyer separately concurred with the Court majority opinion. Justice Stevens's concurrence attacked the \\"originalists\\" view of the Fourth Amendment, noting that the search would remain prohibited had the Court attempted to apply the law based upon the meaning intended by the Founding Fathers, noting that when the Fourth Amendment was written, the law of the time would have made the husband the \\"master of his house\\": > In the 18th century . . . given the then-prevailing dramatic differences > between the property rights of the husband and the far lesser rights of the > wife, only the consent of the husband would matter. Whether \\"the master of > the house\\" consented or objected, his decision would control. Thus, if > \\"original understanding\\" were to govern the outcome of this case, the search > was clearly invalid because the husband did not consent. History, however, > is not dispositive, because it is now clear, as a matter of constitutional > law, that the male and the female are equal partners. Justice Breyer's concurrence Justice Breyer's concurrence stressed that the majority opinion was rather specific, writing \\"the circumstances here include the following\\": > The search at issue was a search solely for evidence. The objecting party > was present and made his objection known clearly and directly to the > officers seeking to enter the house. The officers did not justify their > search on grounds of possible evidence destruction. Cf. Thornton v. United > States, 541 U.S. 615, 620‚Äì622 (2004); Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' > Assn., 489 U.S. 602, 623 (1989); Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, > 770‚Äì771 (1966). And, as far as the record reveals, the officers might easily > have secured the premises and sought a warrant permitting them to enter. See > Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001). Thus, the \\"totality of the > circumstances\\" present here do not suffice to justify abandoning the Fourth > Amendment's traditional hostility to police entry into a home without a > warrant. I stress the totality of the circumstances, however, because, were > the circumstances to change significantly, so should the result. Chief Justice Roberts's dissent Chief Justice Roberts feared the Court's ruling would limit the ability of police to combat domestic violence. Chief Justice Roberts also noted that the purpose of the Fourth Amendment was to protect individual privacy, but any person who shares a dwelling (or, as Chief Justice Roberts points out, a locker or a hard drive) with another person may anticipate that the other person sharing access to their belongings might turn them over to authorities. In short, to share a home with someone is to surrender privacy as to that person, who might then consent to an invasion of it. Roberts also asserted that the majority opinion was arbitrary, as previous case law had held an objecting resident who was being held in the police car, as opposed to in the house, could be ignored with respect to the search.  Justice Scalia's dissent  Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a short dissent as a response to Justice Stevens's concurrence: > The issue of who could give such consent generally depended, in turn, on > ‚Äúhistorical and legal refinements‚Äù of property law. As property law > developed, individuals who previously could not authorize a search might > become able to do so, and those who once could grant such consent might no > longer have that power . . .

It was established by act of parliament in 1982. The university developed from the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland (UBLS), formerly known as the University of Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland (UBBS), which was established in 1964. It became the University of Botswana and Swaziland when the Lesotho campus withdrew to form the National University of Lesotho on 20 October 1975, and then became an independent national university in 1982. The university is divided into eight faculties, which are located in the three campuses of the university. Luyengo campus houses the Agriculture and Consumer Sciences faculties, Mbabane campus is home to the faculty of Health Sciences, and Kwaluseni campus is the main campus. The University of Eswatini is mainly an undergraduate institution, offering bachelor's degrees. There are a few postgraduate programmes including two Ph.D. programmes. The head of the university is the Chancellor. The current Chancellor is His Majesty King Mswati III. Its daily management is the responsibility of the Vice Chancellor, who currently is Professor Justice Thwala. UNISWA is home to various research centers and institutes. The university also publishes some research periodicals such as the UNISWA Research Journal of Agriculture, Science and Technology and the UNISWA Research Journal. History Tertiary education in Eswatini began with the establishment of the University of Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland in 1964 and continued via the University of Botswana and Swaziland between 1976 and 1982. It was only after the splitting of the latter institution in 1982 that the University of Swaziland (UNISWA) was finally established. The Swaziland Agricultural College and University Centre, which came into being in 1966, had developed independently, and it now constitutes UNESWA's Faculty of Agriculture and is situated on the Luyengo campus of the university. Main recipient of the courses offered are officers working for the Ministry of Agriculture and Education. There are two other campuses which, like Luyengo, are situated in the Mbabane/Manzini corridor in the west-central area of the country. The main and oldest campus is at Kwaluseni, which was financed jointly by the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, the Anglo American Corporation, and the Eswatini government. This campus houses the faculties of Commerce, Education, Humanities, and Science. The Mbabane campus houses the Faculty of Health Sciences, established in 1996. Certificate, diploma and degree programmes are offered in general and specialised nursing, community mental health science and environmental health services. Since achieving full university status in the early 1980s, UNESWA has grown in accordance with its chief mandate, which is to assist in the national development effort through manpower production. The output of teachers, nurses and agricultural experts has risen steadily, while the double-subject-major degrees on offer in both the humanities and the sciences have been designed to provide teachers with more than one speciality ‚Äì an important qualification where teacher shortages are endemic. The electronic and electrical engineering programme offered by the Faculty of Science and Engineering reflects the need to rapidly develop the science and technology expertise within the country. Governance and administration The University of Eswatini is governed by the University Council which is appointed by the Chancellor. The present Chancellor of the University is His Majesty King Mswati III. In this capacity, he confers all degrees during the University graduation ceremony. The daily management of the university is the responsibility of the Vice-Chancellor with the assistance of the Pro-Vice- Chancellor. Both are appointed by the University Council and are accountable to it. The current Vice-Chancellor is professor J.M Thwala. In addition there is a University Senate which is responsible for academic authority of the University. It is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor. The Faculties of the University are run by the Deans who are also chairpersons of the respective Faculty boards. They are accountable to the University Senate. Other officers of the university are responsible for various affairs such as the Dean of Student Affairs, Registrar, Physical Planner among others. Students are represented by the Student Representative Council (SRC) which falls under the Student Welfare Office which is run by the Dean of Student Affairs. The issues pertaining student accommodation and residences on the campuses is the responsibility of the warden also under the Student Welfare Office. Campuses The three campuses are within 40 kilometers of each other: *Kwaluseni campus is the main campus, with the faculties of commerce, humanities, social science, education and science. *Luyengo campus was formerly the Swaziland Agricultural College and University Centre (SACUC), and is the location of the faculty of agriculture and consumer sciences. *Mbabane campus was formerly Swaziland's Institute of Health Sciences, and is the location of the university's faculty of health sciences; it includes a nursing school, a midwifery programme and the environmental studies programme. Academics The university is divided into the faculties of Agriculture, Consumer Sciences, Health Sciences, Education, Humanities, Commerce, Science & Engineering, and Social Science. There is also the Institute of Distance Education (IDE) which is responsible for all distance education instruction. The Institute of Postgraduate Studies is responsible for postgraduate programmes at masters and doctorate level. The university is also home to the biggest library in Eswatini. The library has branches in all three campuses with the main and biggest library at Kwaluseni, the main campus. Faculty of Agriculture The faculty of agriculture is housed at the Luyengo campus which is located between Malkerns and Bhunya. The faculty houses the departments of Agriculture and Biosystem Engineering, Agricultural Economics and Management, Agricultural Education and Extension, Animal Science, Consumer Sciences, Crop Production and Horticulture. The faculty offers undergraduate degree majors in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness Management, Agricultural Education, Agronomy, Animal Science, Animal Science (Dairy),and Horticulture. Faculty of Commerce The faculty of commerce is located at the main campus in Kwaluseni. It has two departments namely the Accounting and Business Administration departments and offers only undergraduate programmes.

The Faculty of Health Sciences has the following academic departments: *Community Health Nursing Science *Environmental Health Science *General Nursing *Midwifery Science The Faculty currently offers only undergraduate programmes in nursing and environmental health. Faculty of Humanities The faculty of humanities is divided into the following departments: Academic Communication Skills, African Languages and Literature, English Language and Literature, History, Journalism and Mass Communication and Theology and Religious Studies. The undergraduate programmes offered are the Diploma in Journalism and Mass Communication, Bachelor of Arts (Humanities), Bachelor of Arts (Journalism and Mass Communication). The double major combinations are offered for the B.A. (Humanities) degree. The faculty also offers the B.A. (Humanities) through the institute of distance education. The only graduate programme on offer is the Master of Arts in History through the institute for post-graduate studies. Faculty of Science and Engineering The Faculty of Science and Engineering is the main centre for teaching and research in scientific and technological disciplines in Eswatini. The Faculty is located in the science block in the heart of the University. The faculty is divided into the departments of Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Environmental Science and Planning (GEP), Physics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science. The undergraduate programmes offers are the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and the Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) with the latter under the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department. The undergraduate programme in the faculty usually involves double major combinations from the various departments for the B.Sc. degree. Examples are double majors in Physics and Mathematics, Chemistry and Biology and Mathematics and Computer Science. The main aim for the faculty was to train students with the ultimate goal of them being teachers, with some going on to study Engineering and Medicine outside the country. However, new goals and new programmes such as the Engineering programme were developed to meet new challenges. The Faculty of Science offers two post-graduate courses leading to the Master of Science (M.Sc.) and these are in Chemistry ( either Environmental/Analytical Chemistry or Natural Products and Medicinal Chemistry ) and in Environmental Resource Management (ERM). Research in the faculty of science is based on five themes namely, Environmental Conservation, Energy, Water Quality Management, Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling and Research in Indigenous Medicinal and Nutritious Food Plants. The faculty is home to the Institute of Research in Traditional Medicine, Medicinal and Indigenous Food Plants. Future plans of the faculty are to establish new research centres for Computational Science and Mathematical Modelling, Energy, Environmental Conservation and Water Quality Management. Faculty of Social Sciences The faculty of social sciences is made up of the departments of Economics, Law, Political and Administrative Studies, Sociology and Statistics and Demography. The department of Law offers the only Law programme in the university and in the country. The Bachelor of Laws ( LL.B. ) is the main undergraduate programme in the law department and a Diploma in Law is offered through the Institute of Distance Education. There is no graduate law programme. The remaining departments offer undergraduate majors leading to the Bachelor of Arts (Social Science) or famously B.A.S.S. Double major combination are common in the departments with possibility of a combination with mathematics which is offered in the Faculty of Science. Institute of Distance Education The Institute of Distance Education (IDE) is the main center for distance learning at the university and in the country. It is housed at the main campus at the IDE center. With the motto To Take University Education to the People rather than the People Come to the University, it serves various academic departments by offering distance learning variants of the existing programmes. At present IDE offers six qualifications which are: Certificate in French, Diploma in Commerce, Diploma in Law, Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Arts in Humanities and Bachelor of Education in Adult Education.

The station is currently owned by Eagle Communications. History Old station logo In 1955, Julius D. Spears, an Overland Park, Kansas real estate developer, obtained the construction permit for a new station in St. Joseph. KUSN went on the air on February 1, 1956 on 1270 kHz with 1 kW daytime only. The transmitter was at the present Leonard Road location, with studios at the historic Hotel Robidoux in downtown St. Joseph The Robidoux studios were previously used by KFEQ radio, and KVAK (later KAIR in Atchison.) In 1958, Spears sold the station to Kansas broadcast group owner Wyman Schnepp after being unable to make it financially viable. Schnepp sold the station only a few months later to Charles Norman, a St. Louis-area broadcaster. The studios moved to the fifth floor of the Howitt Building (also known as the KFEQ building) at 8th and Frederick Avenue, in studios also previously inhabited by KFEQ radio. Still unable to make the daytimer financially viable, the station was sold in 1959 to Midland Broadcasters, a company of Frederick Reynolds, who owned the facility until 1977. After the station's application to broadcast after sunset was denied by the FCC in 1960, the station launched an FM counterpart from the Howitt Building location, with 3 kW ERP on 105.1 MHz. As an AM music format daytimer in the 1960s, the station struggled with ratings and competition from full- time AM, and later FM, stations in the St. Joseph and Kansas City markets. In 1967, the station moved from a Top 40 sound to middle-of-the-road music; two years later, in 1969, it flipped to country music. KUSN-FM simulcast the AM formats during much of the same period and also ran a beautiful music format. While the station was small, it had a strong impact on the market and was the launching pad for the early careers of many major market radio broadcasting personalities, including sportscaster George Michael, Skinny Bobby Harper (often attributed as the inspiration for the Dr. Johnny Fever character on WKRP), Rich \\"Brother\\" Robbin (who would work in radio in San Diego), and others. In 1972, the station moved its studios and the FM transmitter to their present transmitter location. In 1974, KUSN-FM was increased to an ERP of 27.5 kW, new call letters KSFT were assigned, and the station was programmed with the Schulke automated beautiful music format. The station was sold to Hunter Broadcasting Group from Jacksonville, Illinois in 1977. Upon its sale in 1979 to Orama, the AM and FM combination was split up; the FM was sold to AM competitor KKJO at that time and became KKJO-FM, while KUSN became KGNM in 1981 after Orama was acquired by Good News Ministries. From 1981 until 2013, KGNM was a Christian station. In 2013, Good News Ministries moved the religious programming to 91.1 FM and Orama installed a classic hits format on 1270. In May 2020, Orama agreed to sell KGNM and its translator to Eagle Communications, owner of St. Joseph's other four commercial stations (KFEQ, KKJO, KESJ, and KSJQ). On June 15, 2020, KGNM changed their format to classic rock, branded as \\"KY102\\". The \\"KY102\\" branding was previously on KYYS (102.1 FM) in Kansas City from 1974 to 1997.

Schuler (November 20, 1929 ‚Äì November 24, 2000) created the New York State Department of Transportationdot.state.ny.us and served as its commissioner under three governors. Mr. Schuler was also founder of The Business Council of New York State, Inc.,bcnys.org New York‚Äôs largest business lobbying organization.  Early career  Mr. Schuler graduated from Syracuse University in 1952 with a bachelor of arts in public affairs and public administration from the Maxwell School of Public Administration. While at Syracuse he became active in New York State Young Democrats, which he served as vice chairman, and he worked in efforts to elect a reform administration in Kingston to replace the Republican organization that then controlled the Hudson Valley city. He volunteered for the U.S. Marine Corps upon graduation, and served in the Korean War as an officer, platoon leader and company commander in the First Marine Division. Mr. Schuler began his public-service career in New York State under the administration of Democratic Gov. W. Averell Harriman. He joined the executive staff of the then Department of Public Works and rose steadily through the ranks under the Republican administration of Governor Nelson Rockefeller. He was the key architect of the reorganization plan under which portions of the Department of Public Works were consolidated with functions from other state agencies to form the New York State Department of Transportation. This was the nation‚Äôs first unified state agency incorporating all transportation-related functions. Mr. Schuler served as the first executive deputy commissioner of the new department under Commissioner Theodore Parker, and then was nominated by Governor Rockefeller to succeed General Parker as its commissioner. In 1974, as Commissioner of Transportation under Governor Malcolm Wilson, Mr. Schuler coordinated the state government‚Äôs disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Agnes. And he led the successful effort to win voter approval of a historic rail bond issue that became the foundation for preserving Amtrak and rail freight service in New York State. The next year Governor Wilson was succeeded by Governor Hugh Carey; Mr. Schuler was the only Cabinet commissioner retained in the new Democratic Party administration. As New York‚Äôs commissioner he led the creation of the Conference of State Departments of Transportation, to help state governments around the nation cope with the growing transportation responsibilities being assigned them by federal policy.  Associated Industries  In 1977 he was recruited to become president of Associated Industries of New York State, Inc., the state manufacturers‚Äô association based in Albany. He immediately focused on two core objectives: to build a constructive rather than hostile relationship between business and government; and to create an organization that would have foundations strong enough for a long-haul, multi-year struggle to restore economic growth in New York State. Before Mr. Schuler entered the private sector, relations between government and the business community were strained and negative. Structural changes in the economy had made the traditional high cost of government in New York an ever more serious competitive disadvantage for the state‚Äôs business community, leading to a marked shortfall in New York‚Äôs economic growth relative to that of the rest of the nation. Business organizations in Albany were openly hostile to the political community, and vice versa. Building on his political skills, his close relationship with Governor Hugh Carey, his longstanding contacts with legislative leaders in both parties, and his knowledge of key players in both business and labor, Mr. Schuler quickly moved to make Associated Industries a more positive force in state government affairs. Seizing opportunities to praise governmental leaders who were working to improve the business climate ‚Äî rather than simply criticizing those who weren‚Äôt ‚Äî Associated Industries played a key role in supporting Governor Carey‚Äôs personal income-tax cuts, and in supporting environmental and labor policies that were sensitive to business concerns. In his first year with Associated Industries, Mr. Schuler negotiated a historic agreement with then state AFL-CIO President Raymond Corbett that raised unemployment benefit levels to benefit the jobless, while enhancing the investment tax credit for companies that were growing in New York State.  The Business Council  Meanwhile Mr. Schuler began the negotiations that led, in 1980, to the consolidation of Associated Industries with its longtime rival, the Empire State Chamber of Commerce, to form The Business Council ‚Äî a single, unified voice for all employers in New York State. The new organization‚Äôs first chairman was Frank T. Cary, who was then the chairman and chief executive officer of IBM Corporation. The most contentious aspect of consolidating the two organizations had been Mr. Schuler‚Äôs insistence that the Board of Directors of the new Business Council should consist of senior corporate executives. The boards of the two predecessor organizations had included a number of mid-level executives who had less clout both within their companies and with government. The senior executives for the new Board were recruited with the active help of Amory Houghton, Jr., then the chairman/CEO of Corning Inc. (and later a Member of Congress), who had first met Mr. Schuler during Corning‚Äôs recovery efforts after Hurricane Agnes. With the consolidated structure in place, Mr. Schuler set about increasing the resources, visibility, stature and clout of the new Business Council. He cast aside the old model of a ‚Äúspecial interest‚Äù business lobby, and determinedly positioned The Business Council as an advocate of economic growth that would benefit all the people of the state. After Mr. Schuler pledged his personal financial resources in order to secure low-cost financing for a new headquarters, the Council renovated a historic but abandoned building at 152 Washington Avenue in Albany; the staff was moved into the new facility in 1981. He strengthened the dues base of the organization, tripled its lobbying and public-relations staff, and expanded the insurance programs that helped its members cut the cost of doing business. He created a research affiliate, The Public Policy Institute,ppinys.org to do in-depth analysis of New York‚Äôs economic and social problems. To project a positive image of New York State to the rest of the world, The Council founded a magazine called New York Alive. In it, Mr. Schuler repeatedly expressed his deeply held affection for New York and its people. ‚ÄúWhat a state!‚Äù he wrote once. ‚ÄúNot just because of its geological features and its natural resources. But New York in its total sense ‚Äî the land, the life style, the work, the culture and, most importantly, the people. Together, the whole adds up to more than the sum of the parts.‚Äù His service at The Business Council strengthened Mr. Schuler‚Äôs reputation for consummate skills as both an executive and a lobbyist. And he relished the occasional flamboyant gesture ‚Äî such as his public presentation of two dozen red roses to then Assembly Speaker Mel Miller in 1986 upon the passage of a major tax-cut bill.  Conrail  In 1981, at the request of then President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Schuler joined the Board of Directors of the Consolidated Rail Corporation, which at the time was under government ownership. He was a leader in the effort to return the corporation to private ownership, playing an active role in the $1.8 billion initial public offering by Conrail on the New York Stock Exchange. He continued on the Conrail board until 1998, through the transition to a $10.5 billion merger into CSX and NS.

It was discovered by Galileo Galilei. On February 4, 1617 he sketched three of the stars (A, C, D), but missed the surrounding nebulosity.Galileo Galilei: Siderius Nuncius, Venice, 1610. English Translation published at Bard College, Hudson NY\\" October 9, 2003 English Translation Original Latin version Tom Pope and Jim Mosher: Galilean telescope homepage\\" March 17, 2006 , \\"Some have expressed puzzlement that in his text Galileo does not mention the nebulosity (known in modern nomenclature as M42) enveloping these stars. ... Galileo believed, as he explains in Sidereus Nuncius, that what looks nebulous to the eye is resolved into stars by his telescope; what looks nebulous through his telescope could presumably also be resolved into stars by a still larger and more powerful telescope. Hence, a diffuse glow would be, more than anything, an indication of the limitations of his telescope and not particularly worthy of special note.\\"Tom Pope and Jim Mosher: Page on Galileo's February 4, 1617 notebook drawing of the Trapezium region, May 2, 2006 \\"Perhaps significantly, Galileo makes no mention of having noticed the now well-known gas cloud, M42, surrounding the Trapezium stars.\\" The fourth component (B) was identified by several observers in 1673, and several more components were discovered later, for a total of eight by 1888. Subsequently, several of the stars were determined to be binaries. Telescopes of amateur astronomers from about 5 inch (127 mm) aperture can resolve six stars under good seeing conditions. The Trapezium is a relatively young cluster that has formed directly out of the parent nebula. The five brightest stars are on the order of 15-30 solar masses in size. They are within a diameter of 1.5 light-years of each other and are responsible for much of the illumination of the surrounding nebula. The Trapezium may be a sub-component of the larger Orion Nebula Cluster, a grouping of about 2,000 stars within a diameter of 20 light-years.  Identification  The Trapezium is most readily identifiable by the asterism of four relatively bright stars for which it is named. The four are often identified as A, B, C, and D in order of increasing right ascension. The brightest of the four stars is C, or Theta1 Orionis C, with an apparent magnitude of 5.13. Both A and B have been identified as eclipsing binaries. Infrared images of the Trapezium are better able to penetrate the surrounding clouds of dust, and have located many more stellar components. About half the stars within the cluster have been found to contain evaporating circumstellar disks, a likely precursor to planetary formation. In addition, brown dwarfs and low-mass runaway stars have been identified.  Possible black hole  A 2012 paper suggests an intermediate- mass black hole with a mass more than 100 times that of the Sun may be present within the Trapezium, something that could explain the large velocity dispersion of the stars of the cluster.

In 1939 she became the first black woman to gain a PhD in education from Harvard University.Tenzing Tsering, Profile: Rose Butler Browne, in A. Rutherford (ed.), Psychology's Feminist Voices. Accessed 5 July 2020. Life Rose Butler Browne was born in Boston, Massachusetts on March 19, 1897, the daughter of John R. Butler, a brickmason and Hannah F. McClenney, who worked at a laundry. Her maternal great-grandmother, Charlotte Ann Elizabeth Lindsey, was a daughter of a native American chief who married a southern slave, worked six years to buy his freedom and later migrated to a Boston ghetto to improve the life of their children. In her autobiography Love My Children, Browne attributed most of her success to the influence of her great-grandmother, called the \\"High Priestess\\" by her family. She moved with her family to Newport, Rhode Island where she grew up. While working as a live-in domestic she earned a bachelor's degree at Rhode Island College. She went on to earn her master's degree at Rhode Island College and then to Harvard University where, in 1939 she became the first black woman to earn a doctoral degree in education. In 1950, she received an honorary degree from Rhode Island College. Dr. Browne taught for many years at Virginia State University and North Carolina College. She was devoted to improving education for minority children. Dr. Browne served on the facilities of Virginia State College, West Virginia State College, and Bluefield State College in West Virginia before becoming chairman of the education department at North Carolina College. A crusader for black rights, Dr. Browne once refused to send students into teaching jobs in West Virginia as long as State Board of Education continued paying black teachers lower salaries than white teachers. The publicity and subsequent shortage of teachers forced the board to alter its policies. After retiring in 1963, Dr. Browne operated a day care center for children at the Mt. Vernon Baptist Church in Durham, where her husband was the pastor. Returning to Rhode Island, she operated a summer school aimed at the culture gap faced by black children, and later worked with senior citizens.

It was founded in 1987 and was officially launched in 1993. The organisation was formerly known as the Third World Organization for Women in Science (TWOWS). It is a program unit of UNESCO and based at the offices of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), in Trieste, Italy. The organisation aims to unite eminent scientists from the developing and developed world with an objective of supporting their efforts in the development process. It also aims at promoting the representation of its members in the sphere of scientific and technological leadership. It does so through different programs like memberships, fellowships, and awards.  Objectives  Scientific research and advancement is important to generate knowledge and products aimed at solving problems faced by society. The generation of such knowledge is especially important in the developing countries which face numerable problems like poverty, food scarcity, disease, climate change, and many more. Scientific innovation is not only important to find solutions to these problems but can also contribute to local economies. The inclusion of women in this innovation process provides a unique perspective on the local problems. In many developing countries, women have daily needs and routines oriented to their roles as main care-givers to the elderly and children. Women make up the majority of agricultural workers too, growing and harvesting food for their families, as well as collecting fresh water for drinking. If women are included as both participants in scientific research and as the beneficiaries of scientific research, the impact on children, on the elderly and on local communities will be direct and highly effective. OWSD aims to pursue the following objectives: a. Increase the participation of women in developing countries in scientific and technological research, teaching and leadership; b. Promote the recognition of the scientific and technological achievements of women scientists and technologists in developing countries; c. Promote collaboration and communication among women scientists and technologists in developing countries and with the international scientific community as a whole; d. Increase access of women in developing countries to the socio-economic benefits of science and technology; e. Promote the participation of women scientists and technologists in the sustainable and economic development of their country; and f. Increase understanding of the role of science and technology in supporting women's development activities.OWSD Constitution (August, 2018) https://owsd.net/sites/default/files/OWSD%20Constitution_August%202018.pdf  History  The idea for OWSD was first raised at a conference on The Role of Women in the Development of Science and Technology in the Third World in 1988, organized by the World Academy of Sciences, where more than 200 leading women scientists from 63 developing countries participated. A study group consisting of top women scientists and experts was formed to explore the possibility of creating an organization that would champion the experience, needs and skills of women scientists in the developing world. At a further meeting in Trieste in 1989, the Third World Organization for Women in Science (TWOWS) was established and a constitution adopted. TWOWS was officially launched four years later in 1993, at the First General Assembly in Cairo, Egypt.  Name Change  On June 29, 2010, members voted to adopt a new name - the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) - at the organization's Fourth General Assembly in Beijing, China.  Funding  OWSD is funded by external donors. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) has supported OWSD financially since 1998 and provides full funding for the postgraduate fellowship programme. Since 2010, the Elsevier Foundation has provided funding for the OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Awards for Early Career Women Scientists, given to five women scientists from the developing world each year. In 2017, an agreement was signed with Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) to fully fund a new OWSD fellowship for Early Career Women Scientists.  National Chapters  OWSD has national chapters in 30 countries. National chapters organize regional conferences, seminars and workshops, lead national and regional initiatives for women in science, and provide OWSD members with networking opportunities. National chapters have been established in: *Bangladesh *Bolivia *Botswana *Cameroon *China *Cuba *Egypt *Ghana *Guatemala *India *Indonesia *Iran *Kenya *Malaysia * Mauritius *Mexico * Myanmar *Namibia * Nigeria * Pakistan * Rwanda * South Africa * Sri Lanka * Sudan * Tanzania * Turkey * Uruguay * Yemen * Zambia * Zimbabwe  Programmes   PhD fellowships  OWSD PhD fellowships are offered to women from selected science and technology-lagging countries in the developing world to undertake PhD research in the natural sciences, including engineering and information technology, at host institutes in another developing country. These scholarships cover all costs related to undertaking research in a host country that are not covered by the host institute, including travel, visa and health costs, tuition and bench fees as well as a monthly stipend for the awardees' board, accommodation and living expenses. The fellowship also includes additional funding for each PhD fellow to travel to international workshops and conferences of relevance. The fellowship is offered as either a full-time (up to 4 years) or sandwich option, in which the fellow is a registered PhD student in her home country and undertakes a maximum of 3 research visits at the host institute for minimum 6 up to 20 months. More than 250 women scientists have graduated from the fellowship programme with PhDs since 1998. The programme is funded by Sida, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.  Early career fellowships  The OWSD Early Career fellowship is a prestigious award of up to US$50,000 offered to women who have completed their PhDs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects and are employed at an academic or scientific research institute in selected science and technology- lagging countries in the developing world. Early career fellows are supported to continue their research at an international level while based at their home institutes and to build up research groups that will attract international visitors. The Early Career fellowship programme is funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada. The first cohort of Early Career fellows was awarded in 2018.  OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Awards for Early Career Women Scientists  The OWSD-Elsevier Foundation Awards are an annual prize given to reward and encourage women scientists working and living in developing countries who are in the early stages of their careers. Initially launched in 2010, the Awards are presented to five scientists each year, one from each of the four OWSD regions plus an additional exceptional winner from any region. The eligible scientific disciplines for the Awards rotate between the biological sciences, physical sciences and engineering. Each winner receives US$5,000 and presents her research during a special awards ceremony at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting. Awardees must have made a demonstrable impact on the research environment both at a regional and international level.  Membership  OWSD has more than 8,000 members from 137 countries. Over 90% of OWSD members are women living and working in developing countries who have master's or doctorate degrees in scientific subjects. OWSD has three categories of membership: * Full members are women scientists from developing countries who have completed a master's degree or higher in the natural sciences (including engineering, technology and innovation) or social sciences. * Affiliate members are women scientists from developing countries who have completed a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) in the natural sciences or social sciences. * Friends of OWSD are women and men from developed and developing countries across all disciplines (including science, social science, arts and humanities) who are committed to promoting the objectives of OWSD and who are not eligible for the Affiliate or Full membership categories. Friends of OWSD engage with OWSD and its members through support activities such as mentoring, fundraising, networking, and promoting.  General Assembly  The General Assembly is a meeting of members convened by the Executive Board. The members meet at regular intervals (usually every 4 years) and perform various tasks. The meeting is used to inform members of activities undertaken since the previous General Assembly and present a strategic plan for the next four years. Members are given an opportunity to discuss and provide feedback to the Executive Board and be informed of the general strategies and policies of the Organisation. If Members do not agree with the decisions taken they should contact their regional Vice-Presidents, who can raise their concerns with the Executive Board. Besides this, the General assembly is also in charge for the election of the organisation leadership.  Leadership  OWSD is governed by an Executive Board, composed of a President, four regional Vice Presidents and four regional Members. All the members of the Executive Board are elected by the members of the general assembly who vote out of the shortlist of candidates which were selected through an online voting system. All Members are invited to attend the General Assembly and have the right to participate in its discussions but only Full Members have the right to vote. The OWSD Secretariat is headed by the OWSD Programme Coordinator who is given the authority to make decisions and implement operations and programmes according to the direction set by the Executive Board. The Secretariat acts as chief point of contact and liaison between regions and the national chapters, and administers the programmatic activities.

The organisation celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2018 and released its first Annual Report. The report highlighted the membership of over 7,100 scientists from more than 150 countries. It also detailed the work of the organization through its headquarters in Italy and the 20 other National chapters in developing countries across the globe.OWSD Annual Report (2018) https://owsd.net/sites/default/files/OWSD%202018%20Annual%20Report%20-%20web%20small_0.pdf OWSD‚Äôs flagship programme has been the South-to-South PhD fellowship programme, which aims at supporting the mobility of women scientists. The fellowship provides support to women from scientifically- and technologically- lagging countries (STLCs) to undertake PhD research at a host institution of recognized research excellence in another developing country. In the past ten years, a total of 314 fellowships have been awarded. By 2018, 251 fellows had successfully graduated and a further 193 were enrolled and completing their studies. In 2018, OWSD launched an Early-Career fellowship program. This fellowship is funded by the Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and greatly increases the impact of the organization. It expands the scope of OWSD's programmes by providing fellowships to scientists in the early stages of their career. The first cohort included 19 candidates from 11 different countries.

Scroggin moved the station to St. Joseph in 1925 where it was noted for its live remote daily broadcasts three times each day from the St. Joseph Stockyards and four times each day from the St. Joseph Grain Exchange. During this time it moved initially from 833 kilocycles, to 1120, to 1300, to its present location at AM 680 in 1930. During its early years, it was a daytimer, powered at 2,500 watts and required to go off the air at night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 40 In the 1940s, the station was allowed to stay on the air around the clock, powered at 5,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1943 page 108 It was an NBC Blue Network affiliate, running its schedule of comedies, dramas, news and sports during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" The Blue Network became ABC in 1945.

She is best known for having created the title role in the German-language musical Elisabeth.  Biography  Douwes was born in Amsterdam, North Holland, The Netherlands, as Petronella Irene Allegonda Douwes, to an arts dealer and a social worker, and is the grandniece of Doris Day. Initially Douwes wanted to become a nurse for mentally handicapped children, then she danced in a disco when she was 19 years old and realised that she wanted to dance. She went to London and searched for a dance school in the Yellow Pages. She chose the Brooking School of Ballet. Without any prior dance education, she auditioned (with a sprained ankle) and was accepted. One year later she attended a musical workshop with Susi Nicoletti and Sam Cane in Vienna. Cane is said to have told Douwes' father at that time: \\"If she doesn't become a star, I'll hang myself!\\" In 1986, she got her first small part in the German-language premiere of Little Shop of Horrors in Vienna. More small parts followed, and in 1987 she got her first part in a larger production, as a Swing in Cats in Amsterdam. With this production she toured Russia in 1988, playing Grizabella and Jellylorum. More parts followed, including Fantine in the original Amsterdam production of Les Mis√©rables in 1991, but the great break came in 1992, when she got the title role in the world premiere of Elisabeth in Vienna, Austria. Though the Viennese papers wrote a lot of scathing criticism, such as \\"Munter geht die Sisi unter\\" (\\"Sisi perishes\\") and they denied Douwes singing and acting talent of any kind, Douwes became (along with Uwe Kr√∂ger) an acclaimed musical star and reprised the title role numerous times. Elisabeth is today the most successful German- language musical of all-time. Until 1994 she played Elisabeth, then played more parts like Rizzo in Grease (Vienna) and Eva Per√≥n in Evita in the Dutch touring production. She was also active in other areas; she sang and spoke the leading part for the Dutch versions of the movies Pocahontas and Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World. Additionally she did the gala evenings In love with Musical along with her colleagues Uwe Kr√∂ger, Marika Lichter and Viktor Gernot. In 1999 she played Velma Kelly in the Dutch premiere of Chicago. Then Douwes went back to her roots and played the leading part of Elisabeth again in the Dutch and German premieres of the musical. After a total of 900 performances as the Austrian empress, she went back to the Netherlands in February 2002 to take part in the Broadway musical Fosse, along with Dutch musical stars Simone Kleinsma and . In March 2003 she got the chance to play Milady de Winter in the world premiere of the Dutch musical 3 Musketiers (The Three Musketeers). The musical was later recorded (with her) and is now available on DVD. In 2004 she played Velma Kelly in Chicago again, but this time she performed in the West End of London and then on Broadway, being the first Dutch actress to take a leading role in a production on Broadway. Back again in the Netherlands she played Clara in Passion. Then she went back to Germany to play Milady de Winter again in the German premiere of 3 Musketiere in Theater des Westens in Berlin. She played the part until 30 October 2005. In 2007, she was seen as a judge on Op zoek naar Evita (In search for Evita), a Dutch reality show. The winner was cast as Eva Per√≥n, a role Douwes played over a decade ago, in a new Dutch production of Evita. In 2008, Pia was a judge on the German reality show Ich Tarzan du Jane in which they looked for both Tarzan and Jane to star in the German production of Tarzan and returned as a judge and coach on \\"Op zoek naar Joseph\\", similar to the search for Evita, but this series searched for the male lead in the musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. In late 2008, she donned the turban as the infamous Norma Desmond in the Dutch touring production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard, alternating in the lead role with her friend and previous Les Mis√©rables, Chicago and Fosse co-star, Simone Kleinsma. In 2009 she returned yet again to judge and coach the contestants of a new Op Zoek Naar... series, this time searching for the woman who would play Mary Poppins. After the program ended, Pia played the role 'Velma Kelly' for six weeks on the West End in 2009. From August 2010 until January 2011 she played the 'Killer Queen' in the rock musical We Will Rock You in Utrecht. She then toured all over the Netherlands with the Dutch production of Master Class, in which she played the part of Maria Callas. The tour lasted until the end of May 2011, with two extra performances in September 2011. Pia has played the role of Mrs. Danvers in the Stuttgart production of Rebecca, Claire Zachanassian in the Vienna production of Der Besuch der alten Dame, Diane in the F√ºrth production of Next To Normal, and currently she is playing Mrs. Wilkinson in the Dutch production of Billy Elliot the Musical. Pia Douwes is the most famous European musical actress alongside Ute Lemper. She has taken part in over 25 CD productions, and was a duet partner of Jos√© Carreras.

It has about 18,000 inhabitants. It is located in a hilly part of the historical region of Moravia, 10 km west of the city of Zl√≠n, at the confluence of the rivers Morava, D≈ôevnice and the Mojena Brook. Economy In past the town was significantly connected with the Bata company which owned multiple local industries including the large shoe factory that created its initial wealth. Barum (Continental AG) has a manufacturing facility in Otrokovice which is a major employer for the town. Another important manufacturing site is Toma where various companies of various industries are located, and Zlin Aviation that operates from the airfield next to the Barum factory. Shopping The town lacks a clear centre, instead having a scattering of shops and other businesses across several areas. In 2014, a large Kaufland store opened towards the south of the town. This area has turned into a commercial centre including a pet shop, toy shop and a large electrical retailer. Transport In addition to the conventional modes of transport, Otrokovice is also equipped with private domestic airport and a wharf at Ba≈•a navigable canal. Rail Otrokovice is the primary stop on the main train line from Prague, with fast trains taking around 3 hours. It is also a hub station with trains going East through Zlin and South, through Star√© Mƒõsto. Road Highway 55 now links the town into the main Czech highway network. Driving time to Prague is around 2:40 and to Brno is 50 minutes. Bus The town has a regular bus service, linking main areas of the town. Trolleybus line connects Otrokovice with Zl√≠n. Paths A new path (suitable for cycling and inline skating) was built in 2014, following the course of D≈ôevnice river to Zl√≠n.

It was released May 9, 2006 by Vice Records. The album was produced by Gus Van Go. Emily Haines from fellow indie band Metric appeared on \\"Baby Blues,\\" while Jason Collett of Broken Social Scene and Sam Roberts were featured on the track \\"Oh Shoplifter\\". The album debuted at No. 6 on the Top Heatseekers chart, but failed to hit the Billboard 200. In Canada, the album did not fare well on the charts. It premiered at No. 51 before moving out of the Top 100 the following week. The album was later released in the UK in 2007 by Drowned in Sound Recordings, including two new tracks. Without Feathers featured a major personnel change; with the departure of original lead guitarist Greg Paquet, drummer Dave Hamelin moved to guitar and sang lead vocals on the majority of the album's tracks. It was also the first Stills album to feature keyboardist Liam O'Neil as a full-time member, and was the debut for drummer Julien Blais. The album also marked a big change in sound, from the 1980s-influenced post-punk revivalism of their debut to a happier, more rootsy Americana-oriented approach, which Pitchfork termed \\"cheerful and heartfelt\\".

They are not part of the direct consequences of criminal conviction, such as prison, fines, or probation. They are the further civil actions by the state that are triggered as a consequence of the conviction. Introduction The criminal justice system applies criminal law to defendants accused of committing a crime. If the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty, the sentencing authority (usually a judge) imposes a sentence. The sentence is a direct consequence of the conviction. This sentence can take many forms, including loss of privileges (e.g. driving), house arrest, community service, probation, fines and imprisonment. Collectively, these consequences of the crime are referred to as direct consequences ‚Äì those intended by the judge, and frequently mandated at least in part by an applicable law or statute. However, beyond the terms of the sentence, a defendant can experience additional state actions that are considered by the state to be collateral consequences such as: disenfranchisement (in some countries this may be separately meted out), disentitlement of education loans (for drug charges in the United States), loss of a professional license, or eviction from public housing. These consequences are not imposed directly by the judge, and are beyond the terms of a sentence itself for the actual crime. Instead, they are civil state actions and are referred to as collateral consequences. In most jurisdictions, being charged with a crime can trigger state civil action in the form of an investigation to determine if the charges trigger the civil statutes that attach to the criminal charges. An example would be criminal charges that can trigger deportation, or the revocation of a professional license, such as a medical, nursing, or pharmacist license. Being subject to collateral consequences has been called a form of civil death. The collateral consequences of criminal conviction are not the same as the social consequences of conviction. Social consequences include loss of a job and social stigma. These social effects of criminal charges (whether or not they lead to convictions) can arise in countries where arrests and legal proceedings are matters of public record, thus disseminating the information about the event to the public to the detriment of the accused. Collateral consequences in Australia In general, the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction are similar to those in other countries. Any non-citizen who fails the character requirementsAustralia: Department of Immigration and Border Protection - \\"Character and police certificate requirements.\\" of the country's Department of Immigration and Border Protection will generally: *not be allowed to re-enter Australia, if outside Australia *be ordered removed from Australia, if still in the country Circumstances under which a non- citizen will fail the character test include one or more terms of imprisonment, totalling 12 or more months, whether the imprisonment took place in Australia or overseas. Collateral consequences in Canada Collateral consequences were defined by Justice Wagner of the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Pham in 2013.R v Pham, 2013 SCC 15, [2013 1 SCR 739.] Justice Wagner defined collateral consequences broadly, stating that they are \\"any consequences for the impact of the sentence on the particular offender.\\"R v Pham, paragraph 11. He ruled that judges can take collateral consequences into account during the sentencing procedure, so long as the sentence they impose is proportionate and they do not impose \\"inappropriate or artificial sentences\\" that circumvent \\"Parliament's will\\".R v Pham, paragraphs 14-15. Justice Wagner also stated that, at least in the case of collateral consequences involving immigration, appellate courts can intervene to change a sentence if the trial judge was not aware that such a consequence would arise as a result of his or her sentence.R v Pham, paragraph 24. The issue arose in Pham because under Canadian federal law, a resident of Canada who is not a citizen can be removed from Canada if the person is convicted of certain types of criminal offences. The removal process is not part of the sentence for the criminal offence, and therefore is a collateral consequence. Once a non- resident person is required to leave Canada because of a criminal conviction, they are not entitled to come back to CanadaGovernment of Canada: Immigration - \\"Determine if you are inadmissible\\". unless they meet the rehabilitation requirements.Government of Canada: Immigration - \\"Overcome criminal convictions\\". A non-resident who is convicted of an offence carrying a life sentence is normally barred from Canada for life, if released from incarceration.Halifax Chronicle-Herald, November 4, 2014: \\"Man convicted in Halifax murder gets full parole, to be deported to Vietnam.\\" R. v. Pham involved an offender whose sentence would have made him ineligible to appeal his deportation if it were not reduced in length by one day.R v Pham, paragraphs 3-4. Neither the sentencing judge nor the offender's lawyers were aware of the potential immigration consequences at the time of sentencing.R v Pham, paragraphs 4-5. At the Supreme Court, Justice Wagner concluded that, had the sentencing judge been aware of the collateral consequences, he or she would have imposed a sentence that avoided them.R v Pham, paragraph 25. He therefore reduced the length of the offender's sentence by one day.R v Pham, paragraph 26. Following the Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Pham, lower courts extended its applicability to other collateral consequences. For example, courts have held that stigma or the loss of employment following a conviction to be collateral consequences that can be taken into account during sentencing.R v Lennox, 2013 BCPC 273 (21 June 2013). R v Bell, 2013 MBQB 80 (28 March 2013). The British Columbia Court of Appeal also ruled that a \\"lifetime ban...from income and disability assistance as a result of conviction...\\" is a collateral consequence and that a more lenient sentence may be imposed to avoid such a consequence.R v Dennis, 2013 BCCA 153 (27 March 2013), paragraphs 9 and 36. Collateral consequences in New Zealand Collateral consequences are generally, more or less, similar to those in the countries mentioned earlier. Any non-citizen to whom the following applies will generally not be allowed to reside in or visit New Zealand: # deportation from any country # a prison sentence, or series of such sentences, adding up to 5 or more years # in the past 10 years, a sentence of imprisonment of 12 or more months (other than a sentence covered in (2) above).New Zealand Immigration: Police Certificates.Immigration New Zealand: Immigration Act, 2009. Collateral consequences in the United Kingdom Such consequences can include: *loss of professional licence (particularly within occupations covered by the Common Law Police Disclosure policy)Common Law Police Disclosure. *deportation (if not a citizen) *loss of ability to obtain a heavy goods vehicle or passenger carrying vehicle licence after a conviction for some serious driving offences, particularly those causing deathThe Highway Code, Annex 5. Penalties. *loss of ability to legally possess a firearmFirearms Act 1968, c 27, s 21 Some limitations are in place in England and Wales due to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, though this includes a number of exceptions. Collateral consequences in the United States Outline of collateral consequences In the United States, collateral consequences can include loss or restriction of a professional license, ineligibility for public funds including welfare benefits and student loans, loss of voting rights, ineligibility for jury duty, and deportation for immigrants, including those who, while not American citizens, hold permanent resident status. In general, all states impose such consequences. In all jurisdictions throughout the U.S., judges are not obligated to warn of these collateral consequences upon a finding of guilt by trial, or prior to an admission of guilt by plea agreement, except as regards deportation. Deportation has been made an exception by the Supreme Court in Padilla v. Commonwealth of Kentucky.Padilla v Commonwealth of Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010). There are currently few legal remedies available for these collateral consequences. In recent years, some governmental organizations have, however, discouraged actions that would cause unfairly harsh collateral consequences; for example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) urges human resources managers not to automatically exclude all ex-convicts from employment consideration, particularly if they are members of minorities with disproportionate incarceration rates.U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: \\"Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\" Efforts to include collateral consequences in sentencing in the United States If a defendant is punished beyond the sentence prescribed by law (that is, if collateral consequences do occur), the punishment is then more severe than that intended or warranted. In the worst case, this might violate protections under the United States Constitution, including the Eighth Amendment, which forbids \\"cruel and unusual punishments\\". The Supreme Court of the United States addressed collateral consequences of criminal convictions as early as 1984. In Strickland v. Washington, the Court explored ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to collateral consequences of criminal convictions.Strickland v Washington, 466 U.S. 688 (1984) In evaluating competence, the Court explained, judges should look at all relevant circumstances and evidence of appropriate measures of professional behavior, such as the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice (\\"ABA Standards\\"). The ABA Standards require defense lawyers to consider collateral consequences of conviction. Judges, accordingly, should monitor the performance of counsel. States chose to apply this rule in varying ways. Strickland encouraged but did not mandate consideration of collateral consequences. Some claim that structural incentives exist for lawyers to not elicit information relevant to collateral consequences because doing so may prolong a case; others note that no attorney or judge could predict any and all collateral consequences of a criminal conviction. Since Strickland did not require an analysis of collateral consequences, they generally are not regarded as cause to overturn criminal convictions. However, some argue that the Constitution should require consideration of collateral consequences. Most states do not accord much legal effect to the collateral consequences of criminal convictions. For example, in New York the consideration of collateral consequences is merely discretionary, while the elucidation of direct consequences is required. For instance, in People v. FordPeople v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 657 N.E.2d 265, 633 N.Y.S.2d 270 (N.Y. 1995). New York's highest court held that a defendant's guilty plea would not be overturned on learning that the defendant was not advised at the time of the plea that his conviction could result in his deportation. Likewise, the Kentucky Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Fuartado, 170 S.W.3d 384 (Ky. 2005) held that the failure of defense counsel to advise a defendant of potential deportation did not give rise to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.Commonwealth v. Fuartado, 170 S.W.3d 384 (Ky. 2005). Rulings regarding deportation were superseded by Padilla v. Kentucky in 2010. \\"... counsel must inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation.\\" The United States Supreme Court held that the collateral consequence of deportation was a consequence of such great importance that failure by counsel to advise the defendant of deportation is ineffective assistance of counsel which is a constitutional protection under the Sixth Amendment. After Padilla, there has been significant litigation in the lower courts about whether attorneys are required to advise their criminal clients about other consequences of convictions. In 2004, the Public Defender Service of the District of Columbia assembled a document outlining some collateral consequences.Collateral Consequences of Criminal Convictions in the District of Columbia: A Guide for Criminal Defense Lawyers. In May 2005, Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye of the New York State Court of Appeals organized the Partners in Justice Colloquium to address the issue of collateral consequences.Partners in Justice: Colloquium on Developing Collaborations Among Courts, Law School Clinical Programs, & the Practicing Bar (2005). Judge Kaye formed a working group which, in partnership with the Lawyering in the Digital Age Clinic at the Columbia University Law School, created a site that, for the first time, collects academic works, court opinions, and professionals' resources (by virtue of a message board and database) in one place.Collateral Consequences of Criminal Conviction, New York State The Columbia University Law School in collaboration with the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning developed and a Collateral Consequences Calculator for looking up and comparing collateral consequences of criminal charges in New York State.Collateral Consequences Calculator: New York State. In 2009, the American Bar Association created the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction, a searchable database of the collateral consequences in all U.S. Jurisdictions. The National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction is supported by a grant from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of the Justice. This project was initially supported by Award No.2009-IJ-CX-0102 awarded by the National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice and by the ABA Criminal Justice Section. In Federal law, the federal sentencing guidelines have a model for collateral consequences which is determined by the date of when the offense was committed and by the type of the offense.

Symptoms  Many patients experience one or more phantom phenomena after the removal of the eye: *Phantom pain in the (removed) eye (prevalence: 26%) *Non- painful phantom sensations *Visual hallucinations. About 30% of patients report visual hallucinations of the removed eye. Most of these hallucinations consist of basic perceptions (shapes, colors). In contrast, visual hallucinations caused by severe visual loss without removal of the eye itself (Charles Bonnet syndrome) are less frequent (prevalence 10%) and often consist of detailed images.  Pathogenesis   Phantom pain and non-painful phantom sensations  Phantom pain and non-painful phantom sensations result from changes in the central nervous system due to denervation of a body part. Phantom eye pain is considerably less common than phantom limb pain. The prevalence of phantom pain after limb amputation ranged from 50% to 78%. The prevalence of phantom eye pain, in contrast, is about 30%. Post-amputation changes in the cortical representation of body parts adjacent to the amputated limb are believed to contribute to the development of phantom pain and non- painful phantom sensations. One reason for the smaller number of patients with phantom eye pain compared with those with phantom limb pain may be the smaller cortical somatosensory representation of the eye compared with the limbs. In limb amputees, some, but not all, studies have found a correlation between preoperative pain in the affected limb and postoperative phantom pain. There is a significant association between painful and non-painful phantom experiences, preoperative pain in the symptomatic eye and headache. Based on the present data, it is difficult to determine if headaches or preoperative eye pain play a causal role in the development of phantom phenomena or if headache, preoperative eye pain, and postoperative phantom eye experiences are only epiphenomena of an underlying factor. However, a study in humans demonstrated that experimental pain leads to a rapid reorganization of the somatosensory cortex. This study suggests that preoperative and postoperative pain may be an important co-factor for somatosensory reorganization and the development of phantom experiences. Visual hallucinations Enucleation of an eye and, similarly, retinal damage, lead to a cascade of events in the cortical areas receiving visual input. Cortical GABAergic (GABA: Gamma- aminobutyric acid) inhibition decreases, and cortical glutamatergic excitation increases, followed by increased visual excitability or even spontaneous activity in the visual cortex. It is believed that spontaneous activity in the denervated visual cortex is the neural correlate of visual hallucinations. Treatment Treatment of painful phantom eye syndrome is provision of ocular prosthesis in the empty orbit.

These include Eton College; The King's School, Canterbury; The King's School, Worcester; Durham School; and Westminster School, although at Westminster their name changes depending on whether the current monarch is male or female (under Elizabeth II, they are Queen's Scholars). King's Scholars at Eton College At Eton College, a King's Scholar (known as a \\"Colleger\\" or colloquially as a \\"tug\\") is one who has passed the College Election examination and has been awarded a Foundation Scholarship and admitted into a house known as \\"College\\", the premises of which are situated within the original ancient purpose-built college buildings. It is the original and oldest Eton house (strictly speaking it was established before the house system developed at Eton, for use by Oppidans) and consists solely of King's Scholars ranging in age from 13 to 18. At any one time there are about 70 King's Scholars, who are distinguished by the wearing of a black academic gown over the usual school uniform of a tail-coat. They thus represent the original core of the institution founded by King Henry VI as a charity school to provide free education to 70 poor boys who would then go on to King's College, Cambridge, founded as a sister institution by the same King in 1441. The other 1,200 boys at the school, the majority of whom pay full fees, and who appeared later in the history of the College, are known as Oppidans because they live not within the original ancient college buildings, but in boarding houses within the town (Latin: oppidum) of Eton. The gown is said to be the basis of the traditional nickname given to Collegers of \\"tugs\\", from the Latin Gens Togata, i.e. \\"toga'd people\\". As the College's statutes provide for 70 King's Scholars, who remain in College for five years, about 14 are admitted per year (a \\"block\\" in Eton argot), at the age of 13. They share most aspects of school life with the Oppidans, including lessons and most sport. However they eat all their meals in College Hall, which has hosted many distinguished guests in its long history including Queen Elizabeth I, and are privy to certain ancient formal traditions not practised by Oppidans. One other difference is that Collegers usually play the Wall Game in the winter term for the full five years, while Oppidans tend to play it only in their last year. Collegers live in the original ancient central area of the school, either overlooking or in close proximity to School Yard, bounded by Eton College Chapel and Lupton's Tower, with the Founder's Statue in its centre. The boarding house in which Collegers live includes Chamber, the older section, with rooms looking into School Yard, and New Buildings, on the reverse side, which contains the majority of the boys' rooms. Historically a Foundation Scholarship used to provide full and unconditional waiver of all the school fees, but since the 1960s the scholarship has been increasingly subjected to means testing. As of 2009 a scholarship now only guarantees an automatic remission of 10% of the usual fees. However part or all of the remainder may also be waived, dependent on financial circumstances. King's Scholars have the post-nominal letters KS appended to their surnames in the school lists. Oppidans who have distinguished themselves academically, but who may have elected not to become Collegers, are called Oppidan Scholars, and similarly have OS attached to their surnames in the school lists, but receive no financial benefit and are distinguished in no other way from other Oppidans.

As at Eton, they are selected by competitive examination (\\"The Challenge\\"), board at the oldest house in the school, known as College, and wear gowns during school Abbey services in Westminster Abbey. King's Scholars at King's College Cambridge The term King's Scholar is also used for undergraduates at King's College Cambridge who obtain first-class degrees. They receive a prize of ¬£350, and are entitled to attend a ceremony in the King's College Chapel at which they sign their name in the King's Scholar book. A three-course formal dinner is held afterwards at which the scholars dine for free with their respective Directors of Studies (DoS). This is a historical hang-over from scholarships endowed by the college's founder (King's College Cambridge and Eton College were both founded by Henry VI, and are sister colleges). There had been a rumour that King's Scholars could put KS at the end of their name to denote their award. This has been proven to be nothing more than a rumour, as was confirmed by the Senior Tutor of the college. King's Scholars at the King's Schools The seven King's Schools at Canterbury, Chester, Ely, Gloucester, Peterborough, Rochester and Worcester were re-endowed or re-founded by King Henry VIII in 1541 following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and award King's Scholarships in his name. Originally all pupils at the King's Schools were endowment-funded King's Scholars; the King's Schools now generally award the King's Scholarship in recognition of academic or musical attainment, and the Scholarship is often accompanied by a discount on school fees. By statute of Queen Elizabeth II, the King's Schools were granted the right to award Queen's Scholarships in 1973, both in recognition of the reigning Queen, and because many of the King's Schools, previously all single-sex schools, were moving towards co- education at the time. King's School Ely The King's School Ely awarded King's Scholarships to 12 boys every year until 1973 when Queen Elizabeth II requested for the scholarship to be awarded to high achieving girls as well, in conjunction with her visit to the school. Thus every year 6 girls and 6 boys from the lower sixth are awarded the scholarship based on the grades achieved at GCSE with most scholars achieving over 5 A*. The ceremony is carried out in Ely Cathedral in which the Scholars are added as members of the Cathedral foundation. Every year the scholars participate in one of the King's School Ely's oldest traditions, the annual \\"Hoop Trundle\\". Essentially the scholars trundle hoops along the college lane in a race. The tradition derives from when centuries ago, one of the privileges of being a King's scholar was the right to be able to play games in cathedral and college grounds. King's scholars wear a red gown over their uniform and are also entitled to several other privileges: *Former scholars can marry in Ely Cathedral *Are members of the Ely Cathedral foundation for life *They can be buried within the grounds of Ely Cathedral King's School, Canterbury At the King's School Canterbury, King's Scholars are students who have taken the scholarship exam on entry or achieved exceptional grades in their GCSE, usually more than 9 A*. In previous years they wore gowns over their uniforms, a privilege now reserved for \\"purples\\" the heads of houses, captain and vice captain of school and head scholar. Now all academic scholars have a white gown, worn to cathedral services. This is received at a special service in the cathedral where the scholars are admitted to the society. They also gain the right to walk down the aisle at cathedral services first. Scholars do also have the right to wear scholar jumpers, which are the same as the school black ones with a white stripe around the collar and hem. Scholars are entitled to several traditional privileges: *Former KSs can marry in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral *They can be buried within the grounds of Canterbury Cathedral See also Kings School Canterbury#Traditions. King's School, Worcester At the King's School, Worcester, the King's Scholarship is the highest scholarship awarded. It is awarded on the basis of academic or musical attainment, and typically accompanies a reduction in school fees. King's Scholars are generally appointed in the Lower Remove (year 9) on the basis of exam results and an interview, or in the Lower Sixth (year 12) on the basis of attainment up to GCSE. All scholars appointed in the Lower Remove are titled King's Scholars, regardless of their gender or of the reigning monarch, in honour of Henry VIII; male scholars appointed in the Lower Sixth are also titled King's Scholars; female scholars appointed in the Lower Sixth are titled Queen's Scholars in honour of Elizabeth II. King's and Queen's Scholars are members of the foundation of Worcester Cathedral, and wear a white surplice over their uniform during major school services. The Senior Scholar, who is appointed from among the King's and Queen's Scholars in the Upper Sixth (year 13), has the job of co-ordinating the scholars. In an annual ceremony, the Senior Scholar proceeds to Worcester Crown Court, to demand from the presiding judge, in Latin, a day's holiday for the school, known as Judge's Day. He or she is entitled to be married in the cathedral and buried within the cathedral grounds, and is also theoretically entitled to graze a sheep and a goat on College Green.

Background In 1996, Jason Hutchens entered the Loebner Prize Contest with HeX, a chatterbot based on ELIZA. HeX won the competition that year and took the $2000 prize for having the highest overall score. In 1998, Hutchens again entered the Loebner Prize Contest with his new program, MegaHAL. MegaHAL made its debut in the 1998 Loebner Prize Contest. Like many chatterbots, the intent is for MegaHAL to appear as a human fluent in a natural language. As a user types sentences into MegaHAL, MegaHAL will respond with sentences that are sometimes coherent and at other times complete gibberish. MegaHAL learns as the conversation progresses, remembering new words and sentence structures. It will even learn new ways to substitute words or phrases for other words or phrases. Many would consider conversation simulators like MegaHAL to be a primitive form of artificial intelligence. However, MegaHAL doesn't understand the conversation or even the sentence structure. It generates its conversation based on sequential and mathematical relationships. In the world of conversation simulators, MegaHAL is based on relatively old technology and could be considered primitive. However, its popularity has grown due to its humorous nature; it has been known to respond with twisted or nonsensical statements that are often amusing. Theory of Operation MegaHal is based at least in part on a so-called \\"hidden Markov Model\\", so that the first thing that Megahal does when it \\"trains\\" on a script or text is to build a database of text fragments encompassing every possible subset of perhaps 4, 5, or even 6 consecutive words, so that for example - if MegaHal trains on the Declaration of Independence, then MegaHal will build a database containing text fragments such as \\"When in the course\\", \\"in the course of\\", \\"the course of human\\", \\"course of human events\\", \\"of human events, one\\", \\"human events, one people\\", and so on. Then if Megahal is fed another text, such has \\"Superman, Yes! It's Superman - he can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel with his bare hands - and who disguised at Clark Kent ‚Ä¶\\" IT MIGHT induce Megahal to apparently bemuse itself to proffer whether Superman can change the course of human events, or something else altogether - such as some rambling about \\"when in the course of mighty rivers\\", and so on. Thus likewise - if a phrase like \\"the White house said\\" comes up a lot in some text; then Megahal's ability to switch randomly between different contexts which otherwise share some similarity can result at times in some surprising lucidity, or else it might otherwise seem quite bizarre.  Examples  There are some sentences that MegaHAL generated: CHESS IS A FUN SPORT, WHEN PLAYED WITH SHOT GUNS. and COWS FLY LIKE CLOUDS BUT THEY ARE NEVER COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL.

It is situated south of Bremerhaven.  History  Lacstidi (literally in lake stead), first mentioned in 1059, belonged to the Duchy of Saxony. At the carve-up of Saxony it became a part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, newly raised to imperial immediacy in 1180. In the mid-16th century the inhabitants adopted Lutheranism. During the Leaguist occupation under Tilly (1628‚Äì1630), they suffered from attempts at re-Catholicisation. In 1648 the prince-archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish ‚Äì interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712‚Äì1715) ‚Äì and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the duchy, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which ‚Äì after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 ‚Äì incorporated the duchy in a real union and the ducal territory, including Loxstedt, became part of the Stade Region, established in 1823. In 1974 Loxstedt incorporated a number of smaller municipalities in its environs, among them B√ºttel, Dedesdorf, Eidewarden, Maihausen, Overwarfe, Ueterlande, and Wiemsdorf, which all had never been part of the Hanoveran state but had been part of the neighbouring state of Oldenburg, thus having a different history.

The Bundesstra√üe 437, connecting the Stotel A27 exit to the Weser tunnel, has been constructed so that it can be easily upgraded to an autobahn. The Bundesautobahn 22, the so-called K√ºstenautobahn, which currently is in planning stage, will replace the B 437 in the future. The Bundesstra√üe 71 runs through Bexh√∂vede and Stinstedt, connecting the municipality to Bremerhaven and Beverstedt. Public transport is mostly carried by buses within the public transport association Bremen/Lower Saxony (VBN). A minicab scheme, carried out by BremerhavenBus, offers hourly connections to Bremerhaven and to Loxstedt railway station, which is on the Bremen‚ÄìBremerhaven line and has been served since December 2010 by line RS 2 of the Bremen S-Bahn, running hourly between Bremerhaven-Lehe and Twistringen.Anruf-Sammeltaxi press release Relief of Heinrich Luden, a German historian, in Loxstedt  Twin towns  Loxstedt's twin towns include: * ‚Äì Schwaan (Germany), since 1989  References   External links   Local merchantmen organisation Category:Cuxhaven (district) ","title":"Loxstedt"},{"id":"4478758","text":"The 86th Grey Cup (Canadian Football League championship) was held in 1998 in Winnipeg.

However, after the sun went down, the temperatures plummeted. Mark McLoughlin missed the opening field goal attempt, but Calgary opened the scoring with a single point. The Ti-Cats ran the ball down the field, and Paul Osbaldiston kicked a 24-yard field goal to make the game 3-1. Minutes later, McLoughlin made up for his earlier failure with a 34 field goal to put the Stampeders ahead 4-3. Kelvin Anderson ran in a 3-yard touchdown five minutes into the second quarter. The convert failed, and the Stamps led 10-3. Osbaldiston kicked in a Ti-Cats field goal from the 20-yard line to close the gap at 10-6. Hamilton got revenge with just over three minutes to go in the half, with a great reception by Ronald Williams. Osbaldiston nailed the convert and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats led 13-10. Osbaldiston finished out the half with his third field goal of the game to put the Ti-Cats up 16-10 going into half time. In the second half, Osbaldiston managed a single off a 44-yard missed field goal. Four minutes later, Osbaldiston had another single on a 66-yard punt. On the final play of the third quarter, the Stamps capped a 14-play drive when Jeff Garcia ran in from the one for the touchdown to bring the Stampeders within one point of the Tiger-Cats with the score 18-17. Aldi Henry intercepted a Danny McManus pass to give the Stamps possession at the 13:00 mark of the fourth quarter. The Stampeders were only able to convert a field goal out of the opportunity, but it was enough to give them the lead in the game again. McLoughlin kicked another field goal 5 minutes later to give the Stamps a 23-18 advantage. Archie Amerson made a terrific running play to take the ball to the two-yard line for the Ti-Cats. Williams ran in from the four, but the two point convert attempt failed, giving Hamilton a 24-23 lead with three minutes remaining. After a Calgary drive, place kicker Mark McLoughlin kicked the field goal on the last play of the game to give Calgary the win.

In 1991, a studio demo was recorded resulting in a deal for two albums with Monitor Productions. The first album was released in 1992 as Only Our Death Is Welcome..., followed by Cool Mortification a year later. A record deal followed with Morbid Records and Lies was released in 1995, supported by first European tour with Impaled Nazarene and No Mercy Festivals in 1996. In March 1998 their album Orthodox was released and the band toured extensively through Europe with Cannibal Corpse and in 1999 year with Malevolent Creation and Master. At that point Bruno left the band to form his own band Hypnos, and was replaced by Paul Speckmann formerly of Master. After that they recorded two more albums.

History Nordholz belonged to the Prince- Archbishopric of Bremen, established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712‚Äì1715) - and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which - after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 - incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the Ducal territory, including Nordholz, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823.

It includes five books of odes and one book of ballads. They are among his very earliest works, and reflect the Catholic royalist views of his early twenties. He would write seven different prefaces for it, dated 1822, 1823, 1824, 1826, 1828, followed by one in 1853, at which time he was in self- imposed exile, and a final one in 1880. Hugo expresses a view of the difference between \\"order\\" and \\"regularity\\" which elevates the former on the basis that an irregularity in art can have its own logic, or order, and achieve effects impossible to regularity, or classical evenness. The version of 1826 received a generally positive review from the 22-year-old Sainte-Beuve in the Globe (January 1827), and this review resulted in their friendship. The collection includes Ode √† la Colonne de la Place Vend√¥me, a response to the Austrian ambassador's decision in early 1827 to stop recognizing Napoleonic titles. First published in the Journal des d√©bats, it represents the first praise of Napoleon in Hugo's work (but not a major political shift as he later claimed). It should be distinguished from the ode on the same subject in Les Chants du cr√©puscule. Bibliography *The essential Victor Hugo. Translated by E. H. Blackmore, A. M. Blackmore.

Its beginnings date to the 13th century, and it was rebuilt several times. Like many structures in Warsaw, it sustained much damage in the Warsaw Uprising (1944). Reconstructed 30 years later (1974), it now houses Warsaw's Center for Contemporary Art. History The first castle on the spot was erected by the Dukes of Masovia as early as the 13th century. However, in the following century their court was moved to the future Royal Castle in Warsaw, and the Ujazd√≥w Castle fell into neglect. In the 16th century, a wooden manor was built there for Queen Bona Sforza. It was at Ujazd√≥w Castle, on January 12, 1578, that Jan Kochanowski's blank-verse tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys received its premiere during the wedding of Jan Zamoyski and Krystyna Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Obverse of boratynka coin minted at Ujazd√≥w Castle, featuring profile of King John II Casimir. The ruins of the castle of the Mazovian princes were then incorporated into a new fortified manor built by King Sigismund III Vasa for his son, future King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa. However, there is little evidence that the residence was ever used by the young prince, who spent much of his youth either at his father's court. According to Adam Jarzƒôbski's \\"Short Description of Warsaw\\" from 1643, the entrance to the Ujazd√≥w Castle was adorned with four marble lions (\\"I lwy cztery generalne, Miƒôdzy nimi, naturalne, W≈Ça≈õnie ≈ºywe wyrobione, A z marmuru sƒÖ zrobione; Nie odlewane to rzeczy, MistrzowskƒÖ robotƒÖ grzeczy\\"). Between 1659 and 1665, the building housed the mint of Titus Livius Boratini, who there struck his famous boratynka, a type of copper coin. Again neglected, in 1674 the castle was bought by Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz Lubomirski and then rented to King Augustus II, who ordered the construction there of a new royal residence. The castle, incorporating much of the earlier constructions on the site, was built by Tylman of Gameren, a notable 17th-century architect and engineer. The gardens surrounding the castle, later divided into two separate parks, were refurbished. About that time the ≈Åazienki Eremity and ≈Åazienki Palace were built. The castle's design was further modified by King Stanis≈Çaw II August, who in 1764 commissioned Jakub Fontana, Dominik Merlini, Jean-Baptiste Pillement and Efraim Schroeger to refurbish it. The eastern and western fa√ßades were made taller by the addition of a second floor, while the post- Gameren outbuildings were also rebuilt to the height of the main building, thus creating a large courtyard. About that time, the castle was also included in the so-called Stanislavian Axis, a line of parks and palaces planned in the southern outskirts of Warsaw much like the Saxon Axis in the city center. The palace's reconstruction was almost complete by 1784, when work was abandoned and the building donated to the Polish Army. Reconstruction design of Castle by Carl Friedrich P√∂ppelmann, 1720 Consequently, between 1784 and 1789 the castle was yet again rebuilt, this time by Stanis≈Çaw Zawadzki, who converted it into military barracks. The outbuildings were enlarged substantially. Since that time the building housed the Lithuanian Foot Guard Regiment and the 10th Foot Regiment. During the Ko≈õciuszko's Uprising the castle was the main centre of conscription for the 20th Foot Regiment. After the Partitions of Poland, during the Prussian occupation of Warsaw, the building was abandoned. After the proclamation of the Duchy of Warsaw it was again restored to the army and was converted into a military hospital. However, the plans of converting it to the Central Military Hospital of the Polish Army were postponed by the Congress of Vienna which awarded the Congress Poland to Russia. On April 1, 1818 the hospital was officially opened. It had places for up to 1000 wounded soldiers. After the outbreak of the November Uprising the hospital was enlarged to 1250 beds and an additional annex with places for 600 was opened in the nearby ≈Åazienki complex. Ujazd√≥w Castle about 1775, by Bernardo Bellotto (\\"Canaletto\\") After the fall of the uprising, the Russian garrison of Warsaw was significantly strengthened, while the Polish military units were disbanded. A new central military hospital was built next to what became the Park Ujazdowski and the castle became more of a barrack for the Russian military personnel. Around 1850 the outbuildings were again rebuilt by Jerzy Karol V√∂lck, but were partially demolished 20 years afterwards. After the outbreak of World War I the building was again converted to a provisional hospital by the Russians. Captured by the German army in 1915, on April 10, 1917 it was transferred to the Polish Legions and became the main military hospital for Polish units fighting alongside the Central Powers (the more modern Ujazd√≥w hospital located nearby remained a German-only hospital). After Poland regained her independence in 1918, the internal design of the castle was yet again modified. Since the 1920s it housed several parts of the Warsaw NCO school. The main staircase was restored to its 18th-century representative design. An interesting feature of the staircase was a set of stone tablets placed there May 15, 1927, commemorating the names of all known Polish military medics who perished in wars between 1797 and 1920. Additional tablets commemorated Karol Kaczkowski, Zdzis≈Çaw Lubaszewski and a sculpture by Edward Wittig commemorating all military medics. After the Polish Defensive War of 1939, the Red Cross organized a school for WIA soldiers. The castle was burnt out and damaged by the Germans following the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. After the war, the building was to be rebuilt as the Central Military House. However, the works did not start as the walls of the castle were demolished by the Communist authorities of Poland. In 1975, however, the works on reconstruction of the castle to its 18th-century design were given a green light, and the project by Piotr Biega≈Ñski was chosen. It houses Warsaw's Center for Contemporary Art (Centrum Sztuki Wsp√≥≈Çczesnej) since 1985.http://www.culture.pl/galerie/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/sh2A/content/centrum- sztuki-wspolczesnej-zamek-ujazdowski Centre for Contemporary Art The Castle currently houses the Centre for Contemporary Art, with its collections and temporary exhibitions, concerts, and educational workshops. The Centre has organized over 600 exhibitions since 1990. From 2010 through 2016 the Centre's director was an Italian, Fabio Cavallucci. In 2017 Piotr Bernatowicz was appointed director by Polish culture minister Piotr Glinski, a member of the Law and Justice Party. .In an email interview to the New York Times, Bernatowicz said that the Polish art world is, in his words, \\"dominated by a left-wing, precisely neo-Marxist ideology...Artists who do not adopt this ideology are marginalized‚Äù . The article further said that \\"Mr. Bernatowicz wants to change that and promote artists who have other views: conservative, patriotic, pro-family.

It is situated at the eastern boundary of the Bremian city of Bremerhaven, and 35 km south of Cuxhaven. History Schiffdorf belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (est. as principality of imperial immediacy in 1180). In 1380, under the reign of Prince-Archbishop Albert II, knights of the family von Mandelsloh and other Verdian and Bremian robber barons ravaged burghers of Bremen and people in the entire Prince-Archbishopric. In 1381 the city's troops successfully ended the brigandage and captured the castle of Bederkesa and pertaining bailiwicks, including Schiffdorf. In 1386 the city of Bremen made the noble family, holding the estates of Altluneburg (a part of today's Schiffdorf), its vassal. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown. In November 1654, after the Second Bremian War, Bremen had to cede the bailiwicks of Bederkesa and Lehe (a part of today's Bremerhaven), including Schiffdorf, to the Duchy of Bremen. After the Danish occupation (1712‚Äì1715) the Duchy became a fief to the House of Hanover. In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which, after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814, incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the Ducal territory, including Schiffdorf, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823.

The village is located at the mouth of Douglas Channel, about north of Vancouver and south of Prince Rupert. It is an isolated village accessible only by air and water with a population of 200. It is home to the Gitga'ata (sometimes Gitga'at or Gitk'a'ata), which means \\"People of the Cane.\\" The Gitga'at are members of the Tsimshian nation. As of 2013, 167 band members live on the reserve and 533 members live off reserve in Prince Rupert, Vancouver or other regions. The community is served by seaplane and ferry from Prince Rupert. A distinctive feature of the community is the wooden boardwalks which are used rather than gravel roads. History and culture The Gitga'at geographical name for the bay where the village is situated is Txa≈Çgiu. This name was anglicised to Kalkayu when Indian Reserves were formed in 1889, these being Kulkayu (Hartley Bay) Indian Reserve No. 4 and Kulkayu (Hartley Bay) Indian Reserve No. 4A (the community is physically on No. 4A). The ancient winter village of the Gitga'at, known today as Lax Galts'ap or \\"Old Town,\\" is located north on Douglas Channel. There was also a village site in a small bay on Gil Island, not far from where the Queen of the North sank. Capt. George Vancouver anchored there in 1793, where he observed remains of houses. Both of these ancient sites continue to be used by the Gitga'at today, as they do other important resource and cultural sites within their traditional territories. Hartley Bay was established and settled in 1887 after a number of families left Metlakalta, B.C., where they had joined other Tsimshian people at the utopian mission begun by the lay minister William Duncan. When Duncan and his Tsimshian supporters moved to New Metlakatla, Alaska, many of the Gitga'at returned to their traditional territories. However, they chose to settle at Txa≈Çgiu rather than their ancient village. For most of the twentieth century, the fishing industry sustained the people of Hartley Bay. Today, however, with the decline of the fishing industry, employment has diversified, with tourism playing a significant role. For example, several Hartley Bay residents work at nearby fishing lodges during the summer as guides. Air service is through Hartley Bay Water Aerodrome. The sinking of the Queen of the North in 2006 On March 22, 2006, the people of Hartley Bay helped rescue the passengers of the BC Ferries vessel Queen of the North, by arriving before the Canadian Coast Guard. The town community centre was turned into a rescue centre with the small community providing aid. According to Betsy Reece, \\"everyone not out on the water was helping keep people warm and fed at the cultural centre.\\" The town's populace received the Governor General's Commendation for Outstanding Service on May 3, 2006, for \\"initiative, selflessness and an extraordinary commitment to the well-being of others\\" in the rescue; the honour also cites the town's \\"tremendous spirit and the remarkable example it has set\\". Climate Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Hartley Bay features an Oceanic climate with chilly winters and mild summers. The area receives copious amount of precipitation throughout the course of the year averaging roughly 4500 mm of precipitation annually. While the area experiences rain throughout the year, the summer months of June, July and August are noticeably drier than other times of the year. The area does experience snowfall averaging roughly 200 cm per year.

Early years Camelia Ethel McDonald was born on 24 February 1909 in Bellshill, Scotland, to Andrew McDonald, a coach painter, and Daisy Watts. A native of North Lanarkshire,Dolan states Motherwell, the Evening Times and Gray state Bellshill. Ethel MacDonald, the fifth of nine children, left home at 16, joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and worked at various jobs. In 1925 she met Guy Aldred and, with him, became politically active in the Anti- Parliamentary Communist Federation (APCF). In 1933 she accepted his invitation to work as his secretary, and joined him in the June 1934 formation of the United Socialist Movement (USM). During this time she became fluent in French and German. Spanish Civil War In November 1936 MacDonald travelled to Barcelona with Guy Aldred's partner, Jenny Patrick, to represent and show the support of the Scottish anarchist movement for the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War. In January 1937 she began to transmit regular English- language reports on the war on Barcelona's widely heard Anarchist radio station run by the National Confederation of Labor (CNT). In the crackdown following the events of May 1937 she assisted the escape of anarchists wanted by the Communist secret police and smuggled into prison letters and food for fellow anarchists held by regional authorities. Through her activities in helping anarchists escape Spain, she became renowned in the British press as the \\"Scots Scarlet Pimpernel\\". Between July and November 1937, she was a national figure in the newspapers, with daily reports and inquiries as to her whereabouts and activities. Death of Bob Smillie On 12 June 1937, Bob Smillie, who was a member of the Independent Labour Party that had been fighting with the POUM forces for the Republicans, died while being held by the Valencia police. The police stated that his death had been caused by peritonitis, however, rumours flew around Valencia that he had been beaten to death. MacDonald began reporting the latter version of events on her radio broadcasts and in newspaper articles. This eventually led to her own arrest. MacDonald eventually escaped custody and left Spain altogether, making her way back to Glasgow by November of 1937. Along the way she travelled through Paris and Amsterdam, where she denounced the actions of the Communists in Spain. She continued to publicly discuss the case of Bob Smillie, but her version of events was disputed in the UK by David Murray, a member of the Independent Labour Party who had also been in Spain. Murray insisted that Smillie had died of peritonitis, and he was generally believed until George Orwell returned to London in 1938 and also began to denounce the actions of the Communists in Spain. Georges Kopp, who had been Smillie's commander in Spain, also returned and supported the view that Smillie had been murdered. Later years and death After her return from Spain, Ethel MacDonald worked closely with Guy Aldred, Jenny Patrick, John Taylor Caldwell and other Glasgow anarchists on a shoestring publishing enterprise, The Strickland Press, which published regular issues of the USM organ, The Word. They continued their activities through World War II and the 1950s peace movement, with MacDonald considered as the unofficial manager, bookkeeper and printer of The Strickland Press. She and Guy Aldred donated their papers to the Mitchell Library in Glasgow. The collection numbers approximately 500 items consisting of Spanish newspapers, bulletins, newssheets, flyers, posters, pamphlets and photographs issued under the auspices of the CNT and the Iberian Anarchist Federation during 1936-1938. Ethel MacDonald was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in February 1958 and lost her ability to speak. Within three years she died in Glasgow's Knightswood Hospital at the age of 51.

He kept the anarchist tradition throughout his life, including a decade in Francoist Spain's jails and multiple decades in exile in France.  Background  Abel Paz was born Diego Camacho Esc√°mez on August 12, 1921, in Almer√≠a, southeastern Andalusia, Spain. When he was six years old, he moved in with his Barcelonan uncle, who was a member of the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), a Spanish anarcho-syndicalist labor union. Before his teens, Paz had joined the libertarian Ferrerist school Escuela Natura in Barcelona's El Clot working class district. He moved back briefly to Almer√≠a, where his mother was, too, a CNT member and subscribed to the Libertarian Youth in 1935. Career  Spanish Civil War  By February 1936, Paz had returned to Barcelona just before the start of the Spanish Revolution and Civil War. He joined the CNT-FAI (allied with the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica, founded as a group that fought the CNT-FAI's moderate policies, and fought for the working class and anarchists. Following his 1937 arrest in a clash with Stalinists, he worked in a farm collective, wrote for the FAI's Tierra y Libertad periodical, and fought on the Catalan front. Post-war Spain after the Catalonia Offensive (nationalist Spain in gray, Republican Spain in white) As the war approached its end in early 1939, when Franco's Nationalists retook Catalonia, Paz and hundreds of thousands of anarchists sought asylum in France. In 1942, he returned to Catalonia and attempted to restart the CNT. He was jailed and passed between prisons for five years. Shortly after his release, he was jailed again for another five years for participating in the Libertarian Youth.  Exile  After his release in 1952, Paz returned to the resistance and became the underground organization's delegate to the 1953 International Congress. Paz remained exiled in France, where he traveled and participated in anti-Francoist, CNT, and Libertarian Youth groups. His partner Ant√≤nia Fontanillas (also of anarchist lineage) traveled with him through 1958. Over the next decade, Paz wrote multiple history books, including a biography of CNT figure Buenaventura Durruti, known as the most comprehensive account as of the late 2000s.  Return  In 1975, Francisco Franco died. In 1979, Paz returned to Spain and its anarchist movement. He wrote a four- volume memoir and spoke with young libertarians about his experiences. In the mid-1990s, Paz toured Italian public meetings following interest in Ken Loach's 1995 film about the Spanish Civil War, Land and Freedom. He participated in media accounts of the war through his physical decline and death. Personal and death Paz at his Barcelonan apartment, 2006 Paz's life partner was Ant√≤nia Fontanillas.

For Anarchy! The Iron Column (, ) was a Valencian anarchist militia column formed during the Spanish Civil War to fight against the military forces of the Nationalist Faction that had rebelled against the Second Spanish Republic. History The Iron Column was formed in Valencia at the start of the Spanish Revolution by local anarchists including Rafael Mart√≠ (nicknamed 'Pancho Villa' after the Mexican revolutionary), Jos√© and Pedro Pellicer, Elias Manzanera and Jos√© Segarra. The Iron Column fought on the Teruel front. Aragon front On August 8, 8 centuries (800 militiamen) left Valencia for Teruel. They did it in two batches and in a disorganized way. First, the Alcoy group led by Rafael Mart√≠, which left Valencia with some 150 militiamen, passed through Sagunto, where they were joined by another hundred volunteers. Upon reaching the Teruel town of Sarri√≥n, when they were about 400 strong, they halted a nationalist attack. At the same time, another militia under the command of Jos√© Pellicer Gand√≠a with 400 other volunteers left Valencia. In these early days the column almost totally lacked organization, until after several casualties caused by disorganization in combat they decide to form the centuries. Towards the end of August, the column stabilized at the front and had about 1,600 militiamen who were fighting together with 600 regular soldiers, totaling 2,200. The Iron column was around 12,000 strong in October (and up to 20,000 by the winter), although only 3,000 could be armed, mainly with small arms taken in the assault on the Albereda barracks. The rest of the volunteers were either at the Las Salesas Barracks or at home waiting to be summoned. The Iron Column stood for defense (and extension) of the popular revolution rather than defense of the Republic. Among its earliest acts were the freeing of convicts from the San Miguel de los Reyes prison and the burning of judicial archives. Many of these released convicts joined the Iron Column upon being released from jail. However, the actions of some of these hardened convicts, many of whom had joined only for personal gain, soon gave the Iron column a notorious reputation. Because the fact that the Iron Column vocally opposed the CNT-FAI (the leading Anarchist organization on the Republican side) entrance into the national government, the CNT refused to arm and supply the column, and thus it was forced to rely on confiscations and the aid of regional committees. The Iron Column also found itself embroiled in factional fighting with Communist units and the assault guards. In the town of Benaguasil they had an armed confrontation against the communists who controlled the town. After a confrontation with several deaths on both sides, the government sent planes to attack the anarchist column. Controversy The column was attacked for wanting to impose libertarian communism wherever its militias were. The militias that were inactive at the front dedicated themselves to extending the agricultural collectives in Teruel. Collectivism was also pushed by other columns such as the Torres-Benedito Column, which also defended the collectivities. But more than any other, not even the Durruti Column, the Iron Column acted both as a war militia and as a revolutionary organization: it took minutes of its assemblies, published a newspaper (\\"Line of Fire\\") and distributed manifestos, because it needed to explain its actions in the rear and justify its movements and decisions before the workers and peasants. It came to be considered a community in itself. In September and October, due to the lack of arms and ammunition, hundreds of columns were sent to the rear in search of them. When they got to the rear, they were harassed by law enforcement who tried to arrest and search them. Faced with this provocation, the column responded with force: so on two occasions, one in Valencia and another in Castell√≥n, the revolutionaries stormed the courts to destroy judicial records, the City Council to destroy property records, and even attacked the San Miguel de los Reyes prison where they released the prisoners held there. This was due to Pellicer's initiative against prisons, wherever they were, which incidentally complied with one of the agreements of the CNT of the Zaragoza Congress. In Castell√≥n some 65 rightist and fascist prisoners were shot by the column. They also executed 16 others after a removal of prisoners without accusation or trial in Vinaroz. Also in the search for weapons, rifles and machine guns were seized from the Popular Antifascist Guard (GPA), which were keeping them far in the rear. On October 2, 1936, militiamen from the Column evacuated the prisoners in the hold of the Legazpi ship and executed them at the Paterna Picadero. The CNT at that time was negotiating its entry into the Republican Government, and saw this type of action as a boycott of its initiative, so it disavowed the column and did nothing to counter propaganda campaigns against it. The communist and republican media began to fabricate numerous accusations that the \\"official\\" anarchist media did not deny. The anarchist media sympathetic to the column could hardly do so due to the censorship on the republican side. On October 29, the GPA killed the anarchist Tiburcio Ariza in a raid. At the funeral organized by the Torres Benedito, Iron and CNT 13 columns, they passed near the Generalitat Valenciana which was heavily armed, waiting for a possible attack. When they arrived at the Plaza de Tetu√°n, headquarters of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), they saw that the communists had prepared themselves, taking advantage of the strength of a battalion that had returned from Madrid, and organized an armed ambush in the square. A young communist protesting against the anarchists approached the demonstration and shot into the crowd. This shot is quickly followed by many others, even by machine gun fire, creating chaos in the plaza. The combat lasted half an hour and caused 56 injuries, of which 49 were from the CNT, and about 30 deaths. The immediate reaction was to want to bring down Teruel's forces on Valencia. The communists had that battalion, the GPA and about 300 young men in military training. But the CNT committee avoided the confrontation by reprimanding those responsible for the columns. The last thing the CNT leaders wanted at that time were problems with the PCE, just as the details of entering the government were being finalized. Militarization When, in November 1936, the Government was evacuated to Valencia due to the proximity of nationalist troops to Madrid, several ministers were arrested, humiliated and threatened with death as they passed through Taranc√≥n, a town controlled by the column. By the end of the year Valencia had become a refuge for republican officials and rulers. In mid-December the columns were summoned for an attack on Teruel, the Iron Column was to attack Puerto Escand√≥n. But the battle was fruitless, since the Republicans did not support the artillery attack and their planes did not know how to take advantage of their superiority, nor did they activate any contiguous front so that the enemy would not send reinforcements. The Iron Column resisted the government plan of turning the popular militias into regular army units longer than any other group. Reasons for this resistance can be read in an essay titled \\"A Day Mournful and Overcast\\", written by a member of the Iron Column. A delegate of the Iron Column said at a CNT congress: Delegates more favorable to militarization were sent from other fronts to try to convince the militiamen. Mariano V√°zquez and Juan Garc√≠a Oliver also tried to mediate the matter, although they were ignored. The column, along with others with the same opinion, convened a plenary session of anarchist columns to discuss militarization. After the plenary session, it was seen that it was inevitable. Almost all the anarchist militias agreed to militarize. During a month there were many debates within the column that were causing voluntary losses and expulsions. But finally the column decided to militarize itself. To do so it needed to be relieved. It came down from the front in the second week of March 1937 and was militarized on April 1, becoming the 83rd Mixed Brigade (with many members who had previously been delegates becoming officers). Many members of the column also joined other mixed units, such as the 82nd Mixed Brigade and the 84th Mixed Brigade.

During First Anglo-Sikh War, Gulab Singh helped the British against the Sikhs. The Treaty of Amritsar (1846) formalised the sale by the British to Gulab Singh for 7,500,000 Nanakshahee Rupees of all the lands in Kashmir that were ceded to them by the Sikhs by the Treaty of Lahore.  Early life  The Hill Fort of Maharaja Gulab Singh, 1846 drawing. Gulab Singh was born on 17 October 1792 in a Dogra Rajput family. His father was Mian Kishore Singh Jamwal. He joined the army of Ranjit Singh in 1809 and was sufficiently successful to be granted a jagir worth 12,000 rupees and also 90 horses. In 1808, following another conflict, Battle of Jammu (1808) was annexed by Ranjit Singh. Raja Jit Singh, who was expelled, found refuge in British India, and later received in appanage the estate of Akhrota, Pathankot. Ranjit Singh appointed a governor to administer the newly conquered area which was expanded in 1819 with the annexation of Kashmir by a Sikh force. In 1820, in appreciation of services rendered by the family, and by Gulab Singh in particular, Ranjit Singh bestowed the Jammu region as a hereditary fief upon Kishore Singh. Apart from their sterling services, the family's intimate association with the region commended Kishore Singh's candidature to the Lahore court. In 1821, Gulab Singh captured conquered Rajouri from Aghar Khan and Kishtwar from Raja Tegh Mohammad Singh (alias Saifullah Khan). That same year, Gulab Singh took part in the Sikh conquest of Dera Ghazi Khan. He also captured and executed his own clansman, Mian Dido Jamwal, who had been leading a rebellion against the Sikhs. A statue of Gulab Singh at Amar Mahal Palace, India.  Raja of Jammu  The palace of Maharaja Gulab Singh, on the banks of Tawi River, Jammu, mid 19th century. Kishore Singh died in 1822 and Gulab Singh was confirmed as Raja of Jammu by his suzerain, Ranjit Singh. Shortly afterward, Gulab Singh secured a formal declaration of renunciation from his kinsman, the deposed Raja Jit Singh. As Raja (Governor-General/Chief) of Jammu, Gulab Singh was one of the most powerful chiefs of the Sikh Empire. Under the Imperial and Feudal Army arrangement, he was entitled to keep a personal army of 3 Infantry Regiments, 15 Light Artillery Guns and 40 Garrison Guns.The History of Sikhs, J D Cunningham, Appendix In 1824 Gulab Singh captured the fort of Samartah, near the holy Mansar Lake. In 1827 he accompanied the Sikh Commander-in-Chief Hari Singh Nalwa, who fought and defeated a horde of Afghan rebels led by Sayyid Ahmed at the Battle of Shaidu. Between 1831-39 Ranjit Singh bestowed on Gulab Singh the jagir of the salt mines in northern Punjab, and the nearby Punjabi towns like Bhera, Jhelum, Rohtas, and Gujrat. In 1837, after the death of Hari Singh Nalwa in the Battle of Jamrud, the Muslim tribes of Tanolis, Karrals, Dhunds, Satis and Sudhans rose in revolt in Hazara and Poonch. The insurgency was led by Shams Khan, a Chief of the Sudhan tribeSir Alexander Cunningham, Four Reports Made During The Years 1862-63-64-65, (The Government Central Press, 1871), Volume I, Page 13.Sir Lepel H. Griffin, The Panjab Chiefs., (T. C. McCarthy, Chronicle Press, 1865), Page 594. and former confidential follower of Raja Dhyan Singh. Thus the betrayal of Shams Khan Sudhan against the regime was taken personally and Gulab Singh was given the task of crushing the rebellion. After defeating the insurgents in Hazara and Murree hills, Gulab Singh stayed at Kahuta for some time and promoted disunion among the insurgents. Then his forces were sent to crush the insurgents. Eventually, Shams Khan Sudhan and his nephew were betrayed and their heads were cut off during their sleep while the other tribesmen lieutenants were captured, flayed alive and put to death with cruelty. The contemporary British commentators state that the local population suffered immensely.Hastings Donnan, Marriage Among Muslims: Preference and Choice in Northern Pakistan, (Brill, 1997), 41.  Intrigue at Lahore  On the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839, Lahore became a center of conspiracies and intrigue in which the three Jammu brothers were involved. They succeeded in placing the administration in the hands of Prince Nau Nihal Singh with Raja Dhian Singh as prime minister. However, in 1840, during the funeral procession of his father Maharaja Kharak Singh, Nau Nihal Singh together with Udham Singh, son of Gulab Singh, died when an old brick gate collapsed on them. In January 1841 Sher Singh, son of Ranjit Singh tried to seize the throne of Lahore but was repulsed by the Jammu brothers. The defense of the fort was in the hands of Gulab Singh. After peace was made between the two sides, Gulab Singh and his men were allowed to leave with their weapons. On this occasion, he is said to have taken away a large amount of the Lahore treasure to Jammu.  Recognition as Maharaja  Maharaja Gulab Singh rides a well decorated white stallion across a green field. Circa 1840-45. Memorial Shrines for Gulab Singh and Ranbir Singh, Jammu, India, ca.1875-ca.1940 Meanwhile, in the continuing intrigues at Lahore, the Sandhawalia Sardars (related to Ranjit Singh) murdered Raja Dhian Singh and the Sikh Maharaja Sher Singh in 1842. Subsequently, Gulab Singh‚Äôs youngest brother, Suchet Singh, and nephew, Hira Singh, were also murdered. As the administration collapsed the Khalsa soldiery clamored for the arrears of their pay. In 1844 the Lahore court commanded an invasion of Jammu to extract money from Gulab Singh, reputed to be the richest Raja north of the Sutlej River as he had taken most of the Lahore treasury. However, the Gulab Singh agreed to negotiate on his behalf with the Lahore court. These negotiations imposed an indemnity of 27 lakh Nanakshahee Rupees on the Raja. Lacking the resources to occupy such a large region immediately after annexing portions of Punjab, the British recognised Gulab Singh as a Maharaja directly tributary to them on payment of 75 thousand Nanakshahee Rupees for the war-indemnity (this payment was justified on account of Gulab Singh legally being one of the chiefs of the Kingdom of Lahore and thus responsible for its treaty obligations). The angry courtiers of Lahore (particularly the baptized Sikh, Lal Singh) then incited the governor of Kashmir to rebel against Gulab Singh, but this rebellion was defeated, thanks in great part to the action of Herbert Edwardes, Assistant Resident at Lahore. In the second Sikh War of 1849, he allowed his Sikh soldiers to desert and go to fight alongside their brethren in Punjab. The treaties of Chushul and Amritsar had defined the borders of the Kingdom of Jammu in the east, south, and west but the northern border was still undefined. In 1850 the fort of Chilas in the Dard country was conquered. Maharaja Gulab Singh died on 30 June 1857 and was succeeded by his son, Ranbir Singh.

It was owned by former NASCAR driver Brett Bodine and his then-wife Diane, and fielded the No. 11 car for Bodine, who purchased the team from Junior Johnson & Associates (for whom he had driven for in 1995) during the 1995‚Äì96 offseason. In purchasing the team Brett joined his brother Geoff as an owner- driver, Geoff having purchased the assets of AK Racing after Alan Kulwicki (also an owner-driver) died in a plane crash in 1993. The team closed following the 2003 season after failing to find a full-time sponsor. Sprint Cup Car No. 11 History Brett Bodine drove the 11 car for Junior Johnson in 1995 with Lowe's sponsorship and drove the car again with Lowe's sponsorship in 1996 as an owner/driver. Brett's team struggled with consistency that season but they did manage to finish 24th in the points standings, with one top ten. After the season, Lowe's left to sponsor the No. 31 at Richard Childress Racing and Bodine's sponsorship woes began. 1997 saw Brett sign a long term sponsorship deal that would put Close Call Phone Cards on the car. The season started off well with Bodine achieving two top ten finishes in the first 9 races. However, just half-way into the season Close- Call stopped paying its sponsorship bills and Brett was forced to strip the decals off of his car. The car ran unsponsored for the remainder of the season and Bodine was forced to sell part of the team to Andy Evans, although he later re-acquired full interest. Bodine later accused Evans of trying to steal his team. Bodine's No. 11 at Pocono Raceway in 1997 1998 and 1999 found Bodine with reliable sponsorship from Paychex on his new Ford Taurus. He found modest success in 1998 finishing 25th overall in points, despite failing to finish in the top ten all season. He did, however, manage to finish in the top 20 on eleven occasions. After 1998, Bodine struggled in 1999. He was only able to reach 35th-place in the final standing, again with no top tens and only four top 20s. The No. 11 team also failed to qualify for 2 events and Paychex chose not to return at the end of the season. Without a sponsor having been found, Brett sold half-interest in his team once again, this time to Richard Hilton. As part of the deal Ralphs would come on as the primary sponsor. Although the sale of the team fell through Brett was able to retain the Ralphs sponsorship. However, the team reached only 35th place in the final points standings with no top tens and just 5 top twenties. They failed to qualify for five of the races. Despite this, Ralphs came back to the team in 2001 as the primary sponsor and Brett signed RedCell Batteries as an associate, and the team received engines from Robert Yates Racing. But another blow to the organization RedCell stopped paying its dues midseason, and the team once again was forced to go without strong backing. They were able to work through these troubles and had a very successful season. They qualified for every race, finished in the top ten twice, the top twenty nine times, and moved up five spots to 30th in the points standings. Despite the team's success in 2001 a primary sponsor was not forthcoming for 2002. Brett entered the season with just the associates Timberland Pro and Wells Fargo Financial. Dura Lube came on to help out early in the season until Brett picked up Hooters sponsorship for the 4th race of the season. At the start of the 2002 season the team were way behind in all aspects due to securing sponsorship so late in the season. Brett managed no top tens, only 4 top 20s, and 36th in the final standings while missing four races. Hooters came back in 2003, but with far less money. The team scaled back to only a limited schedule. Geoffrey Bodine drove the car in the Bud Shootout at Daytona and Brett ran 5 early season races before Hooters pulled the plug, leaving the team with no sponsor. To compound problems, that same weekend in practice Brett was involved in a horrifying crash that sidelined him for several weeks. His brother Geoffrey drove the No. 11 Brett Bodine Racing Ford, for his injured brother, in its final race finishing 39th. With no major sponsorship for his team and most of his employees laid off, Brett attempted to run at Indy in a fan-sponsored \\"Brick Car\\" where, for $500, fans would get their name on the car. The program was a success, but Brett failed to qualify for the race by 0.001 seconds. No sponsor was found and the team was sold. Car No. 09 History 2001 saw Brett Bodine Racing expand to a two car team for two races. Driven by the No. 11's car success Brett was able to field a second car, driven by brother Geoffrey, at both Bristol and Homestead with sponsorship from Smirnoff Ice and Miccosukee Casino, respectively. Bodine finished 27th at Bristol and 37th at Homestead. The team was to continue to run a limited schedule in 2002 but was never able to find a primary sponsor. The No. 09 Brett Bodine Racing Fords never returned to the track, with the team number being reassigned to Phoenix Racing. Car No. 27 History In 2002 Hooters had a small sponsorship deal with independent driver Kirk Shelmerdine. When Hooters signed on to sponsor the Brett Bodine Racing team, part of the deal involved Brett was to run Kirk in a couple of races in the No. 27 sponsored by Naturally Fresh Foods. However, this quickly came to end when Kirk was unable to make a race, and the drivers went their own ways. Busch Series Car No. 11 History This car made its debut at Richmond in 2001 with Josh Richeson, a relative of Brett's, behind the wheel. The car's numbers were 6 and 06. In 2002 the car's number was changed to 11 and Brett was able to field Josh in seven races. The car was unsponsored in two events, sponsored by Smuckers in one event and by one of Brett's cup sponsors, Timberland Pro, in the other 4 events. 28th was the best ever finish by this car, achieved in its final start at Richmond in 2002. The team did not have the financial means to run a Busch Series operation in 2003.

Controversies A three-month exhibition of the luxury brand Louis Vuitton in 2011 led to some complaints of commercialism at the museum, with Peking University professor Xia Xueluan stating that as a state-level public museum, it \\"should in fact only be dedicating itself to non-profit cultural promotion.\\" Yves Carcelle, chairman and chief executive officer of Louis Vuitton Malletier, defended the exhibition by stating: \\"What's important is what you are going to discover. I think before money, there's history: 157 years of creativity and craftsmanship.\\" Some critics have also alleged the museum's modern historiography tends to focus on the triumphs of the Communist Party, while minimizing or ignoring politically sensitive subjects such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.

The show, which concentrates on a wide range of subjects intended to educate children, follows Amigo, a little comical character from Mexico, who goes on educational adventures through time and space and gets to visit Shakespeare, see the ancient pyramids, and even travels to other planets. The animated Amigo is based on the legendary character, Cantinflas played by the Mexican actor and comedian Mario Moreno Reyes. The show was created and produced by Televisa. The company was also responsible for the distribution of the show in Mexico. In 1982, Hanna-Barbera Productions dubbed the series into English and retitled it Amigo and Friends and aired in syndication across the United States through Viacom Enterprises. The only two known actors were John Stephenson, who narrates each episode and Don Messick, who voiced Amigo.

Boiki is mentioned in De Administrando Imperio, a 10th-century work by Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913‚Äì959). According to it, the \\"White Serbs\\" lived on the \\"other side of Turkey\\" (i.e. Hungary), in the area that they called \\"Boiki\\" (Bohemia). The area adjacent to it was Francia as well as White Croatia, from where the White Croats trace their origin. Location Sources Constantine VII in De Administrando Imperio recounts in Chapter 32, \\"It should be known that the Serbs are descended from the unbaptized Serbs, also called ‚Äòwhite‚Äô, who live beyond Turkey, in a region called by them Bo√Øki, where their neighbor is Francia, as is also Megali Croatia, the unbaptized, also called ‚Äòwhite‚Äô. In this place, then, these Serbs also dwelt from the beginning... Now, after the two brothers succeeded their father in the rule of Serbia, one of them, taking one half of the folk, came as the refugee to Heraclius, the emperor of the Romaioi... Then, after some time these same Serbs decided to depart to their own homes, and the emperor sent them off. And so, when they had crossed the Danube River, they changed their minds and sent a request to the Emperor Heraclius... the emperor settled these same Serbs in these countries\\". In the 33rd chapter he says, \\"(It should be known) that the clan of the anthypatos and patrikios Michael, son of Visevitz, archon of the Zachlumians, came from the unbaptized inhabitants on the Visla River, called Litziki, and they settled on the river called Zachluma\\". A Latin document from the early 10th century said that the \\"Hungarians moved to Pannonia from Serbia (Ungarorum gens a Servia egressa in Pannoniam)\\". ≈Ωivkoviƒá suggest that this likely refers to Bo√Øki (Bohemia). Dispute Theories on the location of the so-called \\"Boiki\\" and \\"White\\" Serbs have been disputed, but it is generally established to have been around the region of Bohemia and Saxony. Since the 19th century, two most prominent theories were of Bohemia, and the land of the Boykos in Eastern Galicia in the Carpathians. The latter was mostly argued by 19th- century scholars, like Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik (1795‚Äì1865) and Henry Hoyle Howorth (1842‚Äì1923), who also included the White Serbs among the Polabian Slavs. Rather than relating Boiki and Bohemia, which in turn derived from ethnonym of the Celtic tribe Boii, they related the toponym to the much younger ethnonym of the Rusyns sub-ethnic group Boykos. B√©ni K√°llay (1839‚Äì1903) noted that many historians assumed that Serbian territory was identical to the Czech lands (Bohemia) based on DAI's account and the name Bojka, but he also supported ≈†af√°rik's thesis. Other scholars who had a similar opinion were Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá (1885‚Äì1941), and Ljubivoje Ceroviƒá (b. 1936). However, most scholars like Borivoje Drobnjakoviƒá (1890‚Äì1961), Andreas Stratos (1905‚Äì1981), Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá (1929‚Äì2009), and Relja Novakoviƒá (1911‚Äì2003) located them to the West in the area between the Elbe and Saale rivers, roughly between Bohemia and East Germany (Polabia). According to Mykhailo Hrushevsky (1898), Gerard Labuda (1949), Gyula Moravcsik (1949), Jaroslav Rudnyckyj (1962‚Äì1972) and Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski (1964) unlike Croats, there is no proof that Serbs ever lived within Bohemia or in Eastern Galicia, only that they lived near Bohemia, and the connection between Boiki and Boykos is considered to be scholarly outdated and rejected. According to archaeologist V. V. Sedov (1995), the 32nd chapter of De Administrando Imperio indicates it was located in the Lower Lusatia territory where were located the Sorbs, but the 33rd chapter about Zachlumia caused confusion which resulted with several hypotheses. The first group of scholars argued the homeland existed between rivers Elbe and Saale, the second in the upper course of rivers Vistula and Oder, and the third from Elbe and Saale to the upper course of Vistula. However, Sedov concluded that the archaeological data does not confirm any of these hypotheses, and most plausible is the consideration by Lubor Niederle that there's no evidence that White Serbia ever existed and Constantine VII most probably made up Northern Great Serbia only according to the analogy with Great Croatia, which by other historians also did not exist. According to Tibor ≈Ωivkoviƒá, the structure and content of the subchapter about the family of Michael of Zahumlje indicates that this account was likely told by Michael himself. He is not noted as being of Serbian origin. ≈Ωivkoviƒá thought Michael's family may have preserved the memory of their tribal origin. Toponyms and antroponyms Tadeusz Lewicki in his toponomastic research of Polish lands found many toponyms documented between 12th and 14th century with a root \\"Serb-\\" and \\"Sarb-\\" and defined them as both a trace and remnant population of the so-called White Serbs in DAI. Since the 13th and 15th centuries were recorded also personal names and surnames which possibly derive from the ethnonym. However, according to Hanna Popowska-Taborska, the method didn't take into account the unambiguous etymological interpretation of the Serbian ethnonym because of which most probably the majority of the toponyms don't derive from the ethnonym itself. Also, both ≈Åowmia≈Ñski and Popowska-Taborska found them and their abundance unusual which cannot reflect the early medieval great migration of the Slavs, and it rather describes the Sorbian population living on the Polish territory which was brought there from the Elbe river as captives by the Piast dynasty.

Wrede titled Dealing with Dragons, Searching for Dragons, Calling on Dragons, and Talking to Dragons. Additionally, the Book of Enchantments includes one short story titled Utensile Strength and also includes a short story titled The Princess, the Cat, and the Unicorn which takes place in the Enchanted Forest universe, but does not involve any of the familiar characters. Patricia C. Wrede does \\"hope\\" to author a fifth Enchanted Forest novel once her current book contracts have been fulfilled. Dealing with Dragons and Searching for Dragons were also published in the UK under the titles Dragonsbane and Dragon Search. The four books of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles offer adventure along with a female heroine, a witch, a magician, a dragon and many more along with the final one featuring the next generation and a dash of romance as a young man travels through the Enchanted Forest and learns many things. Synopses Dealing with Dragons Princess Cimorene of the kingdom of Linderwall decides that being a princess is too boring and confining, leaves home to work for the dragon Kazul, and discovers and subsequently dissolves a plot by the wizards to take control of the King of the Dragons. Searching for Dragons Cimorene meets the King of the Enchanted Forest, Mendanbar. With their new friends, they collaborate to rescue Kazul‚Äînow the King of the Dragons‚Äîfrom the wizards who have captured her in the Enchanted Forest. Calling on Dragons Morwen discovers that the wizards have stolen Mendanbar's sword, which kept them from stealing the Enchanted Forest's magic, and works with Cimorene to retrieve it. Talking to Dragons Daystar, Cimorene and Mendanbar's son, is sent off into the forest with his father's sword and no knowledge of his heritage. It was written and published first, and then revised later to better fit with the prequel books. Utensile Strength Mendanbar, Cimorene, and Daystar must determine what to do with the Frying Pan of Doom. This short story occurs after the events of Talking to Dragons.  Main characters   Humans  * Cimorene - A highly intelligent and strong-willed princess of Linderwall. The youngest of six beautiful sisters, she is unlike them in both personality and physical appearance, being tall and black-haired rather than blonde and petite. * Zemenar - The Head Wizard of the Society of Wizards, given to being devious and under-handed. Grey-haired with a long, grey beard. * Antorell - The son of Zemenar and a fairly incompetent wizard, with brown hair and beard. Antorell is consistently referred to as not being very smart or intimidating, and is easily manipulated by others. * Morwen - A practical-minded and highly sensible witch who lives in the Enchanted Forest with her nine cats. She is short, with ginger hair and small square glasses. She infuriates Vamist in the third book with her nine cats (he thinks witches should only have one), none of whom are black, and the fact that she grows plain apples in her garden, among other things. * Telemain - An academic magician whose goal in life is to discover the inner workings of every existing type of magic, and has a particular interest in learning the ways of the very secretive wizards. Moderate height with black hair and beard; has a tendency to indulge in overly long and complex technical explanations. * Mendanbar - The King of the Enchanted Forest, an intelligent young man who does not particularly enjoy being king or \\"being 'Your Majestied' every third word\\". Tall and black- haired, marries Cimorene at the end of the second book. * Alianora - The Princess of Duchy of Toure-on-Marsh, captured by Woraug, who becomes friends with Cimorene. Petite with crystallized honey hair. A major character in the first book. * Vamist - Arona Michaelear Grinogion Vamist is a middle-aged, balding campaigner for traditional magic, causing many citizens of the world of the Enchanted Forest‚Äîincluding but not limited to fire-witches and witches that have more than one cat‚Äîto go into hiding, and forcing the rest to conform to his ideas of normalcy. A major character in the third book who meets a rather humorous end. * Daystar - Cimorene and Mendabar's only child, fairly tall with black hair like his parents. Daystar is raised in secrecy by Cimorene, thus does not know his heritage, and is greatly confused when the Society of Wizards deems him a threat. * Shiara - A fire-witch who aids Prince Daystar in his quest. She is not particularly polite, and frequently mouths off or bursts into tears at the slightest hint of stress due to her unstable fire-witch powers. Hinted that Shiara will end up going through princess training (like Cimorene did) to become Prince Daystar's betrothed and Prince Daystar will have to rescue her from her dragon \\"captor\\".  Dragons  * Kazul - A high-ranking female dragon, with bright green scales, whom Cimorene runs away to work for. She becomes King of the dragons in the first book. * Woraug - A distinctly unpleasant bright green dragon, who apparently dislikes Cimorene from the start. * Tokoz - King of the Dragons before Kazul; appears only in the first book of the series. * Roxim - An older dragon with a manner much like a favored uncle. His allergy to wizards (and their staffs) is particularly severe. * Unnamed young dragon - Kazul's grandchild, arguably her \\"most irritating\\" one, and too young to pick a permanent name; travels with Prince Daystar.  Animals  * Murgatroyd - one of Morwen's cats, male, quiet and reserved attitude. * Fiddlesticks - one of Morwen's cats, seal brown male, large appetite (particularly for fish), fairly nosy when he's not involved in a conversation. * Miss Eliza Tudor - one of Morwen's cats, white and fluffy female with blue eyes, as polite as can be expected. * Scorn - one of Morwen's cats, calico female, lives up to her name, forms a relationship with Horatio. * Jasmine - one of Morwen's cats, ginger female, lazy. * Trouble - one of Morwen's cats, a large grey tom with a crooked tail and ragged ear, expresses some jealousy towards Horatio, generally lives up to his name. * Jasper Darlington Higgins IV - one of Morwen's cats, cream and silver male. * Chaos - one of Morwen's cats, grey long-haired tabby male, described as fat. * Aunt Ophelia - one of Morwen's cats, spiky tortoiseshell female, speaks like a Southern Belle. * Quiz - one of Morwen's cats, child of Scorn, also known as the Grand Inquisitor. Black and white, possibly a son of Horatio. * Cassandra - one of Morwen's cats, child of Scorn, grey female, not very noticeable. (Possibly a daughter of Trouble, as Horatio and Scorn would have produced only black and white offspring.) * Grendel - cat belonging to the witch Archaniz, fat black male, not very intelligent. * Horatio - cat belonging to Brandel (a fire witch), black male with white paws and chin, forms a relationship with Scorn. * Nightwitch - kitten belonging to Shiara, gifted by Morwen to her. She appears similar to Horatio and Quiz, is more than likely one of their descendants. * Killer - rabbit that is affected by a number of spells throughout the book Calling on Dragons, by the end being a 7-foot 11-inch blue floating insubstantial winged donkey. * Suz: A small gold (and very energetic) lizard that helps guide Daystar in Talking to Dragons.  Minor characters   Non-dragon people  :Various fairies, elves, giants and dwarves appear throughout the series, and are considered as people. * Ballimore the Giantess and Dobbilan the Giant - Along with her husband, one of Kazul's and Cimorene's friends. Her Cauldron of Plenty comes in handy several times throughout the series, whether making or simply feeding her 12-headed son-in-law, although it fails at dessert (making only burnt mint custard and sour-cream-and-onion ice cream). Her husband Dobbilan gives up his pillaging lifestyle for consulting after meeting Mendabar. While mentioned several times in other books, she makes her first appearance in Searching for Dragons (along with Dobbilan). * Herman (the dwarf) - Herman is a descendant of Rumpelstiltskin, with the same talents, but keeps ending up with children after no one was able to remember his name, even after he changed it. He lends Cimorene and Mendabar the use of a scrying window in Searching for Dragons. He is acquainted with Telemain, from whom Herman bought his home. * Gypsy Jack - A human trader who operates from a multi-colored wagon, specializing in the repair of magical goods; Cimorene and Mendabar make use of this talent when needing repairs for their magic carpet. Jack is a friend of the magician Telemain; first appears in Searching for Dragons. * Brandel - A human fire-witch who lives in the Smoky Swamp, having moved there to get away from Vamist and his pursuits. Like most fire-witches, he can set his hair ablaze without a thought, usually when he gets worked up and angry over a slight. Brandel aids Morwen and Cimorene in Calling on Dragons. * Willin - Mendabar's steward, and undoubtedly the hardest-working employee of the castle.

It was originally a joint project between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Roscosmos, but is now solely an ESA project. This study was conceived as a basic strategic plan to keep a viable European human spaceflight program alive because NASA officials had announced that their Orion spacecraft would be developed without participation of international partners. CSTS had completed an initial study phase, which lasted for 18 months from September 2006 to spring 2008, before the project was shut down before an ESA member state conference in November 2008. However, the head of the ESA denies that the ATV evolution plan is an alternative and talks are still ongoing as to whether or not to continue funding the ACTS plan. As of late November 2008, the project funding has been limited to a feasibility study with a launch of an actual vehicle possible no earlier than 2017. In 2009 Russia decided it would go with a version of the original design of the CSTS and renamed it the Prospective Piloted Transport System (PPTS). ESA decided to go with an ACTS (Advanced Crew Transportation System), an evolution of the CSTS craft that would be an upgraded crewed version of the ATV spacecraft. In mid-2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a ‚Ç¨21 million study into designing a crewed variation of the European ATV vehicle which is believed to now be the basis of the ACTS design. Since early 2013, ESA and NASA have begun cooperation on developing the European Service Module for the current version of the Orion spacecraft. This has cast previous ESA efforts concerning a crewed derivative of the ATV spacecraft into uncertainty. As of summer 2015, no known new developments on the CSTS/ACTS project have been disclosed to the public.  Background   CSTS as an answer to the Orion  In 2004 George W. Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration, a program that includes the United States return to the Moon by 2020 and a crewed mission to Mars by 2030. For these purposes the Orion spacecraft was to be developed. ESA officials have inquired whether they could be part of this program for exploration, however received a negative response. Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's General Director stated with regard to this rejection by NASA: \\"I have been told by Mike Griffin and Marburger that the CEV is not for international cooperation. But if Europe is not involved in the next- generation transportation systems, we will stay forever a second-class partner.\\" In a July 2006 interview with New Scientist, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin however suggested interest in international cooperation in the general context of NASA's Moon exploration plans. \\"The US will return to the Moon but we think we will do it better, that it will be more rewarding for all, if it can do it in the company of as many of our ISS partners as we can, and with new partners.\\" In this statement Griffin speaks of a general cooperation, not a cooperation in developing the Orion, the actual vehicle to be used for Moon missions, which will be an entirely American built spacecraft.  Cooperation with Russia  Since 2004, ESA had been in talks with Roscosmos on cooperation for the development of Kliper, the Russian successor project to the Soyuz spacecraft, which has been in service since 1967. While ESA's management was enthusiastic about this cooperation, their member states turned down funding for a design and collaboration study in December 2005, mainly because certain member states felt that ESA would just be a minor industrial contributor to the program, while Russia would actually develop and design the Kliper spacecraft. On the Russian side, the concept of Advanced Crew Transportation System, ACTS, conceived as a sort of \\"Euro- Soyuz\\", emerged during 2006, when Russian authorities realized that their proposal to replace the Soyuz with the Kliper was too ambitious in terms of funding. After the December 2005 rejection of Kliper by ESA, Jean-Jacques Dordain emphasized that a collaboration with Russia on a new spacecraft could still be decided in June 2006. On June 13, 2006 the press reported that the winged Kliper project had been replaced by a study to develop a capsule under the Advanced Crew Transportation System program that ESA would fund. This rejection by ESA notwithstanding, Kliper was a Russian program that could still have been funded entirely by FKA - although this was unlikely if Russia and Europe would really have gone forward with the CSTS concept together. In mid July 2006, the Kliper tender process was cancelled, after having no winners. Reasons given for choosing the CSTS over Kliper included that the former would offer Europe the possibility to be a full partner in a Russian- European program, because the modular structure (see below) allows for a division of design responsibilities between the partners (for instance, Russia could be in charge of the overall design of the reentry capsule, while ESA works on the habitation module etc.). About ‚Ç¨15 million were pledged for the CSTS program at ESA's regular meeting on June 21 and June 22, 2006. Further funding of the study was to have been asked for at the next ESA meeting in July. Both partners, Russia and ESA, would have borne their own costs in the first 2 years of the program. \\"We are now entering a phase of working with the Russians where we will establish a preliminary design of the vehicle, establish all the legal framework for the operation, delineate the work share for the parties, and outline the aspects of development,\\" said Manuel Valls, head of Policy and Plans Department in ESA's Directorate of Human Spaceflight, Microgravity, and Exploration Program. On 4 July 2006 Russian media reported that the head of the Roscosmos Anatoly Perminov had met with Jean-Jacques Dordain to discuss the CSTS proposal; however, no agreement was signed between the Russians and Europeans as a result. On 18 July 2006 Perminov announced that the Russian tender for the Kliper spacecraft had been cancelled. It was noted that the ACTS proposal had gained more support among ESA member states than the Kliper design. Farnborough Air Show Jean-Jacques Dordain announced on the Farnborough Air show on July 25, 2006 that the collaborative study together with Roscosmos on the ACTS spacecraft would begin in September 2006 and end early in 2008: \\"So in 18 months' time we will have got[sic] a proposal to make to our ministers for the development of such a vehicle.\\" It was confirmed that ESA's financial contribution to this study would be ‚Ç¨15 million, shared among seven ESA member states. The work areas of the study are: * preliminary system design examining the vehicle's configuration * detailed subsystem design including a docking mechanism * development of co- operation mechanisms and agreements, as well as workshare decisions for a full-scale development * crewed lunar flights  Overall Design  After the initial study phase was completed in May 2008, FKA and ESA announced that the overall design chosen was a conical crewed capsule with an ATV-derived service module. The CSTS spacecraft should have had a total mass of 18,000 kg. However, the capsule and service module combined mass may not have been that much. The ACTS follows the format of the Russian Soyuz craft by having a separate descent/ascent module and a detachable orbital module. The descent module somewhat resembles the American Apollo spacecraft command module while the orbital module resembles a man-rated version of the ATV.  Possibilities of missions beyond LEO  Manuel Valls, head of Policy and Plans Department in ESA's Directorate of Human Spaceflight, Microgravity, and Exploration Program noted on the question of available launch vehicles for the CSTS spacecraft that \\"although nothing at this stage is definitive, [...] both the Russians and we think that it is only prudent, and most efficient and effective, to go with 2 stages and not one. The 1-stage has been done already with Saturn V and Apollo. To do that now would entail the development of quite a new launcher and that will take time and money like hell, if I may say. Going with two stages is far more effective [...] because we could use ‚Äì and this is our intention ‚Äì existing launch vehicles or launch vehicles with minimal development.\\" This means that CSTS would have had a tight mass budget, as only launchers with a maximum payload capacity in the class of Ariane 5, Proton or Angara will be available for a launch. With two launches and LEO docking that means that CSTS together with an Earth Departure Stage will not be able to weigh more than about 45 to 50 tonnes in LEO (note however that this is just for the lunar spacecraft, a lunar lander is not integrated in this calculation). An ESA presentation from June 13, 2006 presents a lunar orbital mission of the CSTS spacecraft with 3 launches, of which two are propulsion modules to propel the spacecraft to a trans-lunar trajectory. Such a scenario, while more complicated than the 2-stage approach mentioned by Manuel Valls, gives more leeway in terms of the CSTS' mass budget. EADS Astrium Space Transportation concepts for adapting the Ariane 5 ECB for lunar exploration could increase Ariane 5 LEO performance to 27 tonnes . These performance adaptions would entail the use of a composite solid rocket casing, and upgrades to the Vulcain Mk III and Vinci (ECSB) engines.  Proposed launch sites  Both the ESA's site at French Guiana and the planned Russian spaceport at Vostochny were considered as launch sites for the CSTS spacecraft. It has not yet been decided yet what launcher would carry the spacecraft to orbit, however Manuel Valls indicated that beside a Russian rocket, Ariane 5 could possibly also function as the carrier rocket. Competition within Europe At about the same time as FKA and ESA announced their plans for the CSTS spacecraft, the German space agency DLR together with EADS Astrium announced their support for the ATV evolution proposal. This proposal envisions the development of a modified ATV with a reentry capsule that would be used to return cargo from the ISS by 2013 and in a second phase a crewed vehicle based on this modified ATV by 2017. Those dates were later revised to 2015 and 2020 respectively. This proposal was presented to ESA's governing body at its meeting in November 2008 and received funding for an initial development phase of a cargo return vehicle that may be ready by 2017. The ATV Evolution concept may have contributed to the end of the CSTS project. However, the head of the ESA denies that the ATV evolution plan is an alternative and talks are still ongoing as to whether or not to continue funding the ACTS plan. Later developments In 2009, Russia had decided to keep the general design of the CSTS spacecraft for their new crewed spacecraft, which eventually developed into the PPTS project. In the meantime, the European Space Agency took on a solo project modeling the ACTS after the ATV craft that carries supplies to the International Space Station. At the start of the new decade, Russian plans for the development of the PPTS became gradually postponed. In January 2013, NASA announced that ESA would build the service module for the Orion test flight Artemis 1, which is a major step in international cooperation in deep space exploration. Subsequently, ESA signed an agreement with NASA that saw it shift part of its ATV development focus towards the development of a service module for the Orion spacecraft. This module is derived from the existing service module of the ATV resupply spacecraft. See also  European crewed spacecraft  *Hermes, crewed spaceplane design formerly under development by ESA/CNES.

The Brazilian Federal Constitution establishes that a Vice President succeeds as President when the elected President dies, resigns or is removed from office. The other officers in the line of succession are the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Federal Senate, and the President of the Supreme Federal Court, in that order, but those other officers do not succeed to the presidency as a Vice President would. Instead, they merely serve as Acting President. The Vice President and the other officers in the line of succession, in accordance with the constitutional order of preference, also serve as Acting President when the President is under incapacity, or is suspended due to impeachment proceedings, or when the President travels abroad. In Brazil, when the Vice President dies, resigns or is removed from office, or when a Vice President succeeds to the Presidency, the Vice Presidency remains vacant until the inauguration of the Vice President chosen in the next election. That election is usually the presidential election held in the last year of the presidential term to choose the President and Vice President that will serve in the next four-year presidential term. Only when both the Presidency and the Vice Presidency become vacant at the same time are special elections summoned to elect a new President and Vice President to complete the pending presidential term. Death, resignation or removal from office of the President Should a President die, resign or be removed from office, a Vice-President succeeds as President. The other officers in the line of succession do not become President in those cases. Instead, the next available person in line merely becomes Acting President, and the Constitution dictates that, whenever both the presidency and the vice-presidency become vacant, new elections are to be held. So in the case of an Acting President taking office due to a double vacancy in the presidency and vice-presidency, the Acting President serves only until the special election takes place and the newly elected President and Vice-President are sworn-in. If the second vacancy triggering elections takes place in the last two years of the presidential term, the National Congress is empowered and required to elect the President (and his Vice-President). If the double vacancy of the presidency and vice-presidency takes place in the first half of the four-year presidential term, however, a presidential election by popular vote is held. In any event, the President and Vice-President so elected merely finish what remains of the pending presidential term, and thereafter a new President and a new Vice-President, chosen in the regular general elections, take office for a normal four-year term. Acting President during Presidential travel abroad: the special case of two centers of authority In Brazil, per constitutional custom dating back to the 19th century, whenever a President travels abroad, although the President remains invested with the powers and duties of the office for the purpose of representing the country abroad, the dispatch of the business of the presidency and the discharge of the powers and duties of the office are also vested in the Vice-president as Acting President or, if the Vice-president is also not available, in the next person in the line of succession who is able to serve. The situation is similar in a way to the appointment of Counsellors of State by the British Sovereign. Just like the British Sovereign remains invested with the royal powers while the Counsellors of State are in place to handle the royal functions, so that there are two centers of authority capable of discharging those functions (the Sovereign himself or the Counsellors), when the President of Brazil travels abroad this automatically triggers the assumption of the office of Acting President by the person next in line who is in Brazil, but in that specific case, dictated by constitutional custom and not by the express text of the Constitution, two subjective centers of authority remain in place: the President who is abroad and the Acting President. Service by an Acting President in the event of presidential incapacity or during the trial of charges of impeachment accepted against the President The Vice-President, or, should the vice-presidency be vacant or the Vice-President unavailable, the next person in the line of succession, takes office as Acting President whenever the President is under an incapacity that impedes him from discharging the powers and duties of the presidency. The Vice-President, or the next available person in the line of succession, also assumes the powers of the presidency as Acting President if, authorized by the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate votes to start a trial on charges of impeachment presented against the President. The admission of the charges requires the positive vote of two thirds of the members of the Chamber of Deputies. Once accepted, the charges are sent to the Senate for the trial of impeachment. The Senate, if it accepts to proceed with the trial (a decision that requires the positive vote of a simple majority of the Senators present), must then notify the President that he is now the accused in a trial of impeachment. From the receipt of that notice, the president is suspended from office for a period of 180 days. The suspension cannot be renewed, and ends when the president is acquitted, or automatically at the end of the 180 days, even if the trial of impeachment is not yet finished. During the President's suspension motivated by the acceptance of impeachment charges, the Acting President discharges the duties of the presidency. The situations of presidential incapacity (e.g. for medical reasons), and of presidential suspension due to the acceptance of impeachment charges, differ from the case of presidential travel abroad because, while the absence of the President from the country triggers the assumption of the powers of the office by an Acting President, in that specific case, powers are not transferred from the president to the acting president, and instead two centers of authority remain in place personifying the presidency. In the cases of presidential incapacity or of suspension due to impeachment, however, the President is relieved of the powers of the office, and the duties of the presidency are therefore totally transferred to the Acting President for the duration of his service. Declaration of presidential incapacity While the current Brazilian Constitution prescribes the procedure for impeachment and trial of the president, and speaks of the Vice-President or others discharging the powers of the President in the case of an incapacity, no specific procedure is set out detailing how an incapacity of the president on medical grounds could be declared. Constitutional custom and praxis in the federal and State levels dictate that, in cases when the head of the Executive Branch is unable to discharge the office for health reasons, temporary incapacity can be self declared by means of an executive message addressed to the Legislature; in such cases, the chief executive can reassume his powers by means of a further message to the Legislative Branch in which he declares that the temporary impediment has ceased and that he is thus resuming the duties of his office. However, there is no clear procedure for a declaration of incapacity other than the self declared incapacity; thus if the President were to fall under a severe illness, and refused or were unable to sign a message to Congress spontaneously declaring his incapacity, there is no straightforward constitutional provision specifying the procedure required for the presidential impediment to be recognized. It is speculated that, if an incapacity were to exist, and if no spontaneous self declaration took place, it would fall to Congress to recognize such incapacity, but no procedure or quorum is clearly established. Current order of presidential substitutes As stated above, the only constitutional successor of a President is his Vice President. Only a Vice President becomes President in the event of death, removal or resignation of the elected President. However, the Vice President, in addition to being the President's only potential successor, is also his first substitute, serving as Acting President when the President is abroad, or when the president is suspended pending an impeachment process, or when the president is otherwise incapacitated (e.g., for medical reasons). The line of presidential substitutes comprises, in addition to the Vice President, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Federal Senate, and the President of the Supreme Federal Court, in that order. Those officers are called, in that order, to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency, as Acting President, when both the President and Vice President are not within the country and available to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency. Those officers also serve as Acting President when both the Presidency and the Vice Presidency become vacant, pending new elections to choose a new President and Vice President to complete the pending presidential term. On 7 December 2016 the Supreme Court of Brazil ruled that defendants in criminal cases cannot serve in the order of presidential substitutes after the charges are accepted for trial. At the time, Senator Renan Calheiros was serving as President of the Federal Senate and was a defendant in a criminal case before the Supreme Court, which meant he could not become Acting President of the Republic and was thus excluded from the order of presidential substitutes. Calherios was succeeded by Eun√≠cio Oliveira in February 2017. The following is the current line of presidential substitutes, according to the Constitution: {class=wikitable !# ! Office !

According to the medieval Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, another area referred to as White Croatia was located along with Red Croatia in Dalmatia. Etymology The epithets \\"white\\" for Croats and their homeland Croatia, as well \\"great\\" (megali) for Croatia, is in relation to the symbolism used in ancient times. \\"White\\" is related to the use of colors among Eurasian peoples to indicate cardinal directions. White meant \\"Western Croats/Croatia\\", in comparison to the lands to the east where they had lived before. The epithet \\"great\\" signified \\"subsequently populated\\" land, but also \\"old, ancient, former\\" homeland for the newly arrived Croats to the Roman province of Dalmatia. Historian A. Mayorov emphasizes that the term \\"White Croats\\" and the corresponding \\"White Croatia\\" are relatively new terms that were applied historically after the Croat migrated to new territories. According to the 10th-century De Administrando Imperio (DAI), Croats who remained living in their former lands near the borders of Francia were only recently been called \\"White Croats.\\" Sources The 10th-century treatise De Administrando Imperio (\\"On the management of the Empire\\", later DAI), written in Greek by Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, is the only known document that suggests \\"White Croatia\\" as the place from which Croats migrated to Dalmatia, bordering the coastline of the Adriatic Sea. In Chapter 30, under the heading \\"The Story of the Province of Dalmatia,\\" it says that \\"the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bagibareia, where the Belocroats are now... The rest of the Croats stayed over near Francia, and are now called the Belocroats, that is, the White Croats, and have their own archon; they are subject to Otto, the great king of Francia, which is also Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks\\". In Chapter 31, \\"Of the Croats and of the Country They Now Dwell in\\", it says that Croats in Dalmatia \\"are descended from the unbaptized Croats, also called the ‚Äòwhite‚Äô, who live beyond Turkey and next to Francia, and they border the Slavs, the unbaptized Serbs... ancient Croatia, also called \\"white\\", is still unbaptized to this day, as are also its neighboring Serbs... constantly plundered by the Franks and Turks and Pechenegs... live far away from sea; it takes 30 days of travel from the place where they live to the sea. The sea to which they come down to after 30 days, is that which is called dark\\". In Chapter 32, \\"Of the Serbs and of the Country They Now Dwell in,\\" it was said about the unbaptized (\\"white\\") Serbs, that \\"their neighbor is Francia, as is also Megali Croatia, the unbaptized, also called 'white. Croatia Alba, or White Croatia, is referred to in the Latin Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, compiled no earlier than the 12th century. This work refers to White Croatia as the lower part of Dalmatia (Croatia Alba, que et inferior Dalmatia dicitur), as opposed to Red Croatia, which refers to upper Dalmatia (Croatia Rubea, que et superior Dalmatia dicitur). According to 21st-century historian A. Mayorov, the territory of this Croatia Alba was the most developed and densely populated and formed the core of the emerging Croatian state. In the undated part of twelfth-century Russian Primary Chronicle, which tells about the resettlement of the Slavs from the Danube, White Croats were mentioned once, together with Serbs and Chorutans (Carinthians). According to A. Mayorov, this account is based on Western European medieval tradition and agrees with the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. In addition there are other sources mentioning Croats inhabiting in Central Europe, and Eastern Europe among East Slavic tribes, but no one calls them \\"white\\".. Dispute Approximate locations of four Early Medieval Croatian tribes in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe during the 10th century. The range of Slavic ceramics of the Prague-Korchak culture marked in red, and approximate direction of spread of the Croatian tribes in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe during the 7th-10th century, per V.V. Sedov (1979). The presumed location of Croatian tribes (blue, yellow) in present-day Czech Republic during the 10th century, per V.V. Sedov (2002). In 21st-century scholarship, historians do not agree on the location or even the existence of White Croatia and Great Croatia. According to Majorov, in the 10th century, the ethnic Croats are believed to have been surviving in remnant communities, scattered in the West in Bohemia, with others in the East in Poland, Ukraine, and Slovakia. Given the tradition of using colours for cardinal directions, L. V. Vojtoviƒç argued that the Great Croatia referred to in the 6th century no longer existed in the 10th century. The term White Croatia was used to refer to the Western part of its territory. Scholars such as Vatroslav Jagiƒá have rejected the existence of an independent polity. Similarly, V. V. Sedov noted that there is no archaeological material to prove its existence. Scholars do believe that the Croats gradually moved from the East to the West and South. Interpretations have differed over what geographic area the term Bagibaria refers to. Some scholars have related it to Babia G√≥ra near the river Vistula and Krak√≥w in Lesser Poland, but it is more commonly considered to be a reference to Bavaria. Tibor ≈Ωivkoviƒá notes that this term can come from the Latin name of Bavaria (Bagoaria or, less probably, Baioaria) and, therefore, the source of this information for the DAI could be of West European origin (possibly by Anastasius Bibliothecarius from Rome). Another dispute is about the geographic reference point of the mentioned \\"sea to which they come down to after 30 days, is that which is called dark.\\" Some scholars believe this is a reference to the Baltic Sea, to which people could travel in less than 15 days from Lesser Poland. Others say it is the Black Sea, to which travel would take around 30 days from Prykarpattia (river San and city of Przemy≈õl). The Byzantines knew of the present-day Black Sea very well, but they did not refer to it as \\"Black\\" or \\"Dark\\", but by a word meaning \\"Hospitable\\" (Œï·ΩîŒæŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ), an euphemism for \\"Inhospitable\\". They also used a different term for the word \\"sea\\" in its case (\\"Œ†œåŒΩœÑŒøœÇ\\" (P√≥ntos) and not \\"Œ∏Œ¨ŒªŒ±œÉœÉŒ±\\" (Th√°lassa)). However, more probable is a reference to the Black Sea because in DAI there's no reference to the Baltic Sea, the chapter has information usually found in 10th century Arabian sources like of Al-Masudi, the Black Sea was of more interest to the Eastern merchants and Byzantine Empire, and its Persian name \\"Dark Sea\\" (ax≈°aƒìna-) was already well known. The DAI has other contradictory information. Although the Croats are described as living near the Franks in the West, they were said to be subject to repeated raids by the Pecheneg, who lived far to the East of this territory. The DAI says that the Pechenegs lived north of the Hungarians, and that the Croats bordered the Hungarians on the south. These chapters are known to have been based on several archival sources. ≈Åowmia≈Ñski, Sedov and Majorov suggest that the DAI mistakenly referred to 7th-century locations and migrations of peoples based on the location of contemporary Croats in Bohemia and different sources when the account was compiled. ≈Åowmia≈Ñski criticized the primary use of a source from the South (DAI) instead of sources from the North which makes them more reliable to determine the location of the Northern Croats. In the 13th chapter which described the Hungarian neighbors, Franks to the West, Pechenegs to the North, and Moravians to the South, it is also mentioned that \\"on the other side of the mountains, the Croats are neighboring the Turks\\", however as are mentioned Pechenegs to the North while in the 4th century the Croats are mentioned as the Southern neighbors of the Hungarians, the account is of uncertain meaning, but most probably is referring to Croats living \\"on the other side\\" of Carpathian Mountains. Territory versions White Croatia was initially thought to have been located along the Upper Elbe river in Northeastern Bohemia and/or around the Upper Vistula valley in Lesser Poland. This is based on the DAI description that they lived South-East of Bavaria, North of Hungary, and South of the White Serbs. While the Czech and Polish scholars tended to diminish the existence of the Croats on their territory, Ukrainian and Russian scholars have tended to attribute the Croats with large and influential territories in the East. Polish scholars avoided to locate the Croats at Krak√≥w and considered that did not border at Ruthenia because when Vladimir the Great attacked the Croats in 992 it would have been perceived as a call for war by Boles≈Çaw I the Brave. However, whether the Cherven Cities were inhabited by the Lendians or White Croats, and were independent from both Poland and Kievan Rus', it is part of a wider ethnographic dispute between Polish and Ukrainian-Russian historians. In the 19th and early 20th century, Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik and Lubor Niederle combined both Western and Eastern concept on the localization of Croatia, specifically, to be extending from Eastern Galicia up to Northeastern Bohemia. Niederle argued that they mainly were located on river Vistula, between Czech and Ukrainian Croats, and they formed one big alliance of Croatian tribes which fell apart when the Vistulan Croats migrated to the Western Balkans in the 7th century. Josef Markwart and Ljudmil Hauptmann also placed their main center on river Vistula. The Polish historians mostly were against the localization of Croatian homenland on river Vistula (eventually in Silesia), arguing it is based on loose evidence, and as such ignored Croats and White Croatia in their synthesis of the Polish history. It was in accordance with Czech and German historians who related it with the principality of Slavn√≠k dynasty on Upper Elbe river in Northeastern Bohemia, and considered that those Croats came from Ukrainian Croats on river Dniester, which argued Ukrainian and Russian historians. Scholars tended to locate them on a large territory, N. P. Barsov situated the Croats in the wide area of Carpathian Mountains, on the slopes of Tatra Mountains to the river Tisza and Prut on the South, to the Dniester to the East, and the Vistula to the North. Some scholars considered that White Croatia took in Nisa and Upper Elbe in the West, to Bug and Upper Prut and Siret in the East. According to Francis Dvornik, White Croatia extended from the Southern Bug and rivers Wieprz and San along the Poland-Ukraine border, to the slopes of Carpathian Mountains, including the Northern part of Slovakia, then from the rivers Netolica and Dudleba in upper Vltava, through Cidlina to the Krkono≈°e Mountains to the North and North-West. O. A Kupchyns πkyƒ≠ believed that Eastern Croats had territory from Prykarpattia (at the confluence of the rivers Laborec and Ondava at the crest of the Carpathian Mountains), valley of Beskids, western coast of the river Wis≈Çoka, along Sandomierz valley until middle San, near Dunajec and left coast of Vistula. He said they also likely occupied the upper watershed of the Tisza river at the Ukraine-Slovakia border. In other words, much of the lands of present-day Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine. Sedov sharply criticized such assumptions, saying \\"these hypothetical constructions are now of purely historiographic interest, since they do not find any confirmation in archaeological materials\\". In the second- half of 20th and early 21st century, Sedov believed that the Croats arose among the Antes. After that, they migrated West and settled in several groups in various places. He said that one of these groups were Southwestern neighbours of the Dulebes living in the Northern and Southern area of Eastern Prykarpattia. He and B. O. Tymoshchuk said that the Slavic Gords in Bukovina were an offshoot band abandoned by Croats. Du≈°an T≈ôe≈°t√≠k and Gerard Labuda identified White Croatia with the multi-tribal realm of Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia, while T≈ôe≈°t√≠k and Jaroslav Bakala more precisely located them to present-day Silesia and North Bohemia (Podkrkono≈°√≠ region). Richard Ekblom also placed them in Upper Silesia, and the area of Krak√≥w, Poland. Tadeusz Lehr-Sp≈Çawi≈Ñski mostly agreed with Niederle's location around Vistula river. ≈Åowmia≈Ñski placed the main part of the Croats to the Upper Vistula valley in Lesser Poland, and that the accounts in DAI identified White Croatia with Duchy of Bohemia of Boleslaus I which at the time incorporated the territory of the Vistulans and Lendians, because they were attacked by the Pechenegs, and that according to the sources it is uncertain whether the Croats lived around the Elbe river. Ivo Goldstein located White Croatia around Krak√≥w. Krzysztof Fokt placed them in Upper Silesia in the 9th-10th century. Petr Charv√°t located them in Northern and Eastern Bohemia, noting that the Croat diaspora settlement follows the Carpathian range from Southeastern Poland to Krkono≈°e Mountains in Bohemia. T. ≈Ωivkoviƒá located White Croatia in Bohemia and Southern Poland as well. There also scholars who refute the Croats lived near the Carpathians and rather place them further to the East in the direction of Vyatichi, but it is not well founded. Nada Klaiƒá thought the Croats had migrated from Carantania, rather than from Lesser Poland, but such an idea is rejected by older and newer generation of historians. A. Mayorov distinguishes between the terms and concepts of \\"White Croatia\\" and \\"Great Croatia\\". He agrees that White Croatia appeared to have some historical presence in the Upper Elbe and Upper Vistula regions, but that Great Croatia, the pre-motherland for the Croats, was located east of the Carpathians (possibly also in Transcarpathia). Mayorov suggests that the author of the DAI made an attempt to reconcile the contradictions among various conflicting sources. Toponyms and anthroponyms The extensive toponomastic studies, and their critical review by Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski, show existence of at least several toponyms of settlements in Poland and Czech Republic whose origin is related to Croatian tribal organization and not late medieval migrations. These are in Poland: Klwaty (Krwathi, Chrwathi Phirleonis), Klwatka Szlachecka (Krhwathi Powa≈Çya, Chrwathi), Klwatka Kr√≥lewska (Krwathka, Chrwatka) around the city of Radom, Chirwatowa Wola near Wis≈Çoka river and Horwaty near San river. In Czech Republic: two Charv√°tce near Oh≈ôe river, Charv√°tec near city of Dobrovice on river Elbe, Charv√¢ty and Charv√°ty near Morava river. In Czech Republic only the toponyms in Moravia have the archaic tribal names, while in Bohemia are derivations, implying were formed on the periphery or outside of the Croatian territory. Seemingly the territory of Croatia corresponded to the territory of Lesser Poland. Interestingly, surnames derived from Croatian ethnonym in Poland are recorded since the 14th century in Krak√≥w, Przemy≈õl and else, and generally among Polish native nobility, peasants, and local residents, but not among the foreigners. They used it as a nickname, but probably due to the influence of immigration from the Kingdom of Hungary. According to Hanna Popowska-Taborska, although also Grigoriƒ≠ Andreevich Il πinskiƒ≠ tried to locate White Croatia using toponyms with the root *bƒõl- (Bia≈Ça river and Bielsko-Bia≈Ça), such arguments can be hardly accepted because too many centuries passed between the 7th century migration and first mention of these toponyms and anthroponyms.

History The Mateus brand was created in 1945, and production began at the end of World War II. The wine was especially styled to appeal to the rapidly developing North American and northern European markets. An early admirer was Sacheverell Sitwell: > Among the delights of Portugal are the unfamiliar wines upon the wine > lists... there is one wine that is altogether exceptional, and that comes > from the remote northern Province of Tras-os-Montes.

At that time, worldwide sales were 3.25 million cases per year. Roger Scruton recorded the social impact which the wine had in England: > My two sisters and I were raised in the shelter of penury and puritanical > restraint.

In the UK in 2002, the wine was re-packaged and relaunched in a deliberate effort to capitalise on 1970s nostalgia, although the wine itself had already been made less sweet and slightly more sparkling, in response to modern popular preference for slightly drier wine. The wine continues to be sold, however, in its distinctive narrow-necked, flask-shaped bottle, with unique \\"baroque historic mansion\\" label (Mateus Palace in Vila Real, Portugal) and real cork stopper, but also comes with a screw top from some distributors in Northern European countries and the U.K. market. Varieties More recently, a new variety of the wine has been marketed as \\"Mateus Ros√© Tempranillo\\" produced in Spain, a deeper shade of pink than the original, but in a clear bottle with a silver foil, aimed at wine drinkers in their twenties, especially young women. In 2014 the company launched its \\"Expressions\\" range, comprising three ros√© wines ‚Äì Baga and Shiraz, Baga and Muscat, and Aragonez and Zinfandel ‚Äì and one white wine ‚Äì a Maria Gomes and Chardonnay blend.

The gardens are bordered by East Highfield, Underwood, Stratford and Greenway Roads. In addition to well-groomed, standard ground cover (Azaleas, evergreens, etc...), Sherwood Gardens is famous for its nearly 80,000 tulips that peak in late April. After the tulips finish blooming, on the Saturday of Memorial Day each year the Tulip Dig occurs. Anyone can dig up and purchase the tulip bulbs. The park is maintained and managed by Stratford Green, Inc., a 501(c)3 organization. History During the 1800s the property on which the Sherwood Gardens rest was part of the Guilford estate of A. S. Abell, founder of The Baltimore Sun. The location of the gardens was a pond, which was filled in when the area was developed for housing in 1912 and named Stratford Green by the Olmsted Brothers who designed it and the Guilford community. John W. Sherwood, a son of the president of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company (the \\"Old Bay Line\\") and one-time chairman of the Sinclair Oil Company, began planting tulip beds, azaleas and other interesting flora on his property, adjacent to Stratford Green, in the 1920s. He allowed the public to visit his gardens during the month of May. Sherwood planted his gardens with tulips imported from the Netherlands. Following his death in 1965, Sherwood Gardens was acquired by The Guilford Association, Inc. which then expanded them. The gardens, which were transferred to Stratford Green, Inc., a 501(c)3 organization, are private property and receive no public funding, but are open to the public year-round.

The convent cleared the latter two villages from peasants which were thus abandoned. Along the low side of the Weserm√ºnde Geest ridge towards the marshy Land of Wursten there is a narrow swampy strip of wasteland called the Wursten Sietland.Bernd Ulrich Hucker, ‚ÄûDie landgemeindliche Entwicklung in Landw√ºrden, Kirchspiel Lehe und Kirchspiel Midlum im Mittelalter‚Äú (first presented in 1972 as a lecture at a conference of the historical work study association of the northern Lower Saxon Landschaftsverb√§nde held at Oldenburg in Oldenburg), in: Oldenburger Jahrbuch, vol. 72 (1972), pp. 1‚Äî22, here p. 19. While the Wursten Frisians claimed the Sietland as their commons, the convent started to include it into its demesnes. In the valley cuts of the geest between Hol√üel and Nordholz the convent impounded little becks in order to lay out stewponds for the fish as fasting dishes at lent. The convent's demesne expansion meant the exclusive usage of geest forests, mires and heathes, previously also commonly used by the free Frisian peasants from the mostly treeless Land of Wursten in order to gain turf, firewood, timber and the fertilising plaggen. Thus the demesne expansion posed a massive threat for the material survival of the Wursten Frisians as free peasants. Without fuel, timber or fertiliser they could not help it but would sooner or later have to commendate themselves to feudal lords from the geest. The free Wursten Frisians disliked the noble establishment of a convent in their vicinity and treated the nuns with resentment. In the same time knightly families from the geest aimed at subjecting the Wursten Frisians to their feudal overlordship in order to gain more from unpaid feudal labour and by compelling feudal dues and duties.Bernd Ulrich Hucker, ‚ÄûDie landgemeindliche Entwicklung in Landw√ºrden, Kirchspiel Lehe und Kirchspiel Midlum im Mittelalter‚Äú (first presented in 1972 as a lecture at a conference of the historical work study association of the northern Lower Saxon Landschaftsverb√§nde held at Oldenburg in Oldenburg), in: Oldenburger Jahrbuch, vol. 72 (1972), pp. 1‚Äî22, here p. 14. The convent's desmesne but also manorial expansion just added up to these tensions. In the Wursten War (1256‚Äì1258) the Wursten Frisians repelled a knightly invasion to subject them to manorial (seigniorial) jurisdiction. The array of knights, among them members of the Diepholz and the , then still landed in Rhade, was led by the Knight of Bederkesa. The defeated knights hat to withdraw deep into the Bederkesa Bailiwick and exposed the boundary adjacent to the Land of Wursten, among others the Midlum parish. After the victory the Land of Wursten occupied the Midlum parish. The unsettled geest strips within Midlum's municipal boundary are called Wursten Heath (Wurster Heide) since. However, the convent and the nuns were treated with great care not to deliver Prince- Archbishop any pretext. The Wursten Frisians remembered the ordeal of the free Stedingen peasants in 1234, who refused to accept feudal overlordship too, but whom Gebhard had excommunicated and against whom he induced and fought a papally confirmed crusade, all after few Stedingers had slain an itinerant monk. Under the rule of the sixteen elected consuls of the Land of WurstenThe 16 elected representatives of the free Wursten Frisians were titled consules since the thirteenth century. Cf.

Soon the Midlum parish and its peasant population became integral parts of the Land of Wursten. The convent declined and blamed this to its location among the \\"perverse and bad people [the Wursten Frisians], striving for criminal and unallowed aims\\", as recorded in a convent deed. For them and Bremen's Prince- Archbishop (ruling from 1273 to 1306) hindering the convent's demesne and manorial expansion could be nothing else but an unallowed aim. This finally led to the relocation of the convent out of Wursten Frisian control. So 1282 the convent was moved to Wolde, present Altenwalde, since 1972 a part of Cuxhaven.Ida-Christine Riggert-Mindermann, ‚ÄûNeuenwalde ‚Äì Das Damenstift der Bremischen Ritterschaft‚Äú, in: Evangelisches Klosterleben: Studien zur Geschichte der evangelischen Kl√∂ster und Stifte in Niedersachsen, Hans Otte (ed.), G√∂ttingen: V & R Unipress, 2013, (=Studien zur Kirchengeschichte Niedersachsens; vol. 46), pp. 273‚Äì279, here p. 273\\\\. .

In 1331 the commoner Gerhard de Merne (= Marren, S√ºder- and Nordermarren near Midlum) usurped the tithe from Esigstedt, protested by the convent, the enfranchised beneficiary, and left it again to the nuns only after the pastors of the Wursten parishes had intervened. The still hostile Wursten Frisians looted pilgrims on their way to the convent in Wolde, causing the nuns' decision to move from Wolde on to Neuenwalde. The relations of the Land of Wursten with the convent improved and on 24 June 1383 the Wursten Consuls donated several estates left by people without heirs to the convent in order to pray requiem masses for the deceased.Polycarp-Gottlieb Hempel, Inventarium Diplomaticum Histori√¶ Saxoni√¶ Inferioris Et Omnium Ditionum Brunsvico-Luneburgicarum / Verzeichni√ü derer Urkunden der Historie von Nieder-Sachsen und aller Chur- und F√ºrstlich-Braunschweig-L√ºneburgischen Staaten, darinnen ...

In 1399 the consuls of the Land of Wursten concluded with the convent that they guaranteed safe-conduct through the Midlum parish for the pilgrims on their way to Wolde (present Altenwalde). In 1484 the Wursten Frisians repelled John V, Duke of Saxe- Lauenburg, also ruling in close-by Hadeln, and his troops in the Battle of Alsum, trying to subject them to his feudal overlordship. John's son, Hadeln's Regent Magnus, the heir apparent of Saxe-Lauenburg tried to grind out his father's notch and hired the Great or Black Guard in order to subject the Land of Wursten.

In 1517 Prince-Archbishop opened a campaign to subject the Wursten Frisians. The prince-archiepiscopal government demanded to levy taxes from newly dyked lands and the Wursten Frisians, claiming them as self- acquired, refused to pay. Thus Christopher the Spendthrift sent mercenaries into the Land of Wursten and on 23 December Wursten succumbed in the Battle at the Wremer Tief. Christopher the Spendthrift declared Wursten's autonomous constitution nul and void and obtained his imperial enfeoffment with Wursten at the Diet of Augsburg of 1517.

The Wursten Frisians saw their chance and covered the borderland adjacent to Wursten, including the Neuenwalde convent seigniorial bailiwick, with raids and attacks.

The troops of Christopher the Spendthrift finally subjected the Wursten Frisians in the Battle of Mulsum on 9 August 1524. In 1525 the Wursten Consuls had to conclude the Treaty of Stade, which incorporated Wursten into the prince-archbishopric, did away with the Wursten constitution, including the election of consuls and subjected the Wursten Frisians to feudal dues and duties and prince- archiepiscopal bailiffs (V√∂gte), wielding authoritarian force over the Wursten Frisians. In 1648 the elective monarchy of the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the heritable monarchy of the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown and from 1715 on by the House of Hanover.

History The creek acquired its name from a school which was sited adjacent to it, the Ocean View School (the first school in today's Berkeley, established 1856 on land donated by Jos√© Domingo Peralta). The school was later replaced by the San Pablo Avenue School and still later, the Franklin Elementary School. In 2003, Franklin was closed, and in 2004, the Berkeley Adult School moved into its remodeled buildings. On this site at the corner of Curtis and Virginia Streets, a small park created by citizen volunteers, the Schoolhouse Creek Common, was opened on May 13, 2006. Schoolhouse Creek rises in the Berkeley Hills from a number of small springs just south of Codornices Creek and north of Cedar Street. Its principal tributary, Lincoln Creek begins in the hills at the top of Virginia Street. Schoolhouse and Lincoln have their confluence in the vicinity of McGee and Cedar Streets on the flatlands below the hills. From there the creek runs southwest between Virginia and Cedar Streets. Throughout most of its upper and middle courses, the creek is culverted. It emerges for part of the block between Sacramento and Acton Streets, above Chestnut Street, and again at Curtis Street. Where it crosses the old right-of-way of the Santa Fe railroad, now a pedestrian-bicycle trail, a massive buried concrete abutment and culvert hide the creek. Watershed Originally, the creek flowed into the south end of a large, northward-flowing salt marsh and slough that also carried waters of Codornices and Marin Creeks to San Francisco Bay. West of this marsh, low dunes and a crescent of sandy beach curved northwest to Fleming Point. But the marsh was filled, the creek was channeled into a pipe that also carried sewage to the Bay, and the shoreline was extended westward with Berkeley's garbage. East Bay Municipal District intercepted the sewage in the late 1940s, but the creek still flows in the pipe just north of and parallel to Virginia Street, reaching San Francisco Bay in the squared off \\"North Basin\\" that was destined to be filled by more garbage, before citizen effort halted Bay fill in the 1960s. This shoreline is now part of Eastshore State Park, managed by East Bay Regional Park District. The long-term plan for the park contemplates daylighting the creek here to create a small salt marsh that would also lessen flood danger in West Berkeley.

He taught, guided, and inspired thousands of disciples throughout his lifetime, by word and deed, with legendary diligence and intensity in Torah study. Early years Shmuelevitz was born on the second day of Rosh Hashana 5663 (3 October 1902) in Kovno, Lithuania, to Rabbi Refoel Alter Shmuelevitz and Ettel (n√©e Horowitz), a daughter of Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horwitz, known as the Alter of Novhardok. In Shmuelevitz's youth, his family moved to Stutchin. Until the age of 16, he was educated by his father, who was one of the leading yeshiva lecturers in Lithuania. In 1919 Refoel Alter, who was then the rosh yeshiva of Shaarei Torah in Grodno, died suddenly. Within a very short time, his mother died too, orphaning Shmuelevitz, his younger brother Shlomo, and two sisters. Refoel Alter's position at the yeshiva was taken up by Shimon Shkop. Shmuelevitz developed a close bond with Shkop. At the age of 18, Shmuelevitz's mentor invited him to deliver the third-level shiur in the preparatory academy at the yeshiva. Shmuelevitz held this position for a few years before transferring to the yeshiva in Mir. Many of his students of those years later became great Torah leaders, and his own four years in Grodno with Shkop had a profound influence on his approach to Talmudic analysis. At the age of 22, Shmuelevitz headed a group of students who transferred from Grodno to Mir. In accordance with the contemporary practice in the yeshiva world, Shmuelevitz became known as Chaim Stutchiner,\\"known as R' Chaim Stutchiner.\\" after the shtetl in which he grew up. The Mirrer rosh yeshiva, Eliezer Yehuda Finkel, set his sights on Shmuelevitz as his eventual spiritual heir. He set the seal on this future appointment by offering his student the hand of his daughter in marriage. Shmuelevitz married Chana Miriam,Name on 1930 wedding invitation: the rosh yeshiva's daughter, on the last day of Hanukkah, 3 Tevet 5690 (3 January 1930).His death was also on that date, his 49th wedding anniversary A few years later, at the relatively young age of 31, Shmuelevitz was appointed as a maggid shiur, delivering regular lectures. Shmuelevitz's lectures were modeled on the study strategy of his mentor, Shkop, personalized in a style of his own. The hallmark of his lectures was depth combined with breadth; it was not uncommon for him to cite 20 or 30 different sources from far-flung corners of the Talmud and its commentaries during a single class. These classes attracted a wide audience, including some of the most advanced students in Mir. World War II With the outbreak of World War II, Mir Yeshiva was forced into exile. The students and faculty fled from Mir to Vilna, where they stayed for about two months, after which they moved to Keidan, where they managed to set up the yeshiva once more in 1940. After being ordered out of Keidan seven months later by the Communist authorities, the yeshiva divided into four groups,The article cites Operation Torah Rescue by Rav Yechezkel Leitner, and the latter is cited in: each numbering between eighty and one hundred students. Shmuelevitz's classes continued virtually without interruption throughout the early period of World War II, while when the yeshiva was continually in transit. In late 1940, hundreds of Mir yeshiva students obtained visas from Chiune Sugihara to travel via Siberia and Vladivostok to Japan. The yeshiva stayed in Kobe, Japan, for about six months, and then relocated to Shanghai for the next five years. Although living conditions were extremely difficult, the yeshiva prospered. As Eliezer Yehuda Finkel had gone to Palestine to obtain visas for the yeshiva and was forced to remain there, Shmuelevitz and the mashgiach, Yechezkel Levenstein, assumed responsibility for the day-to-day running of the yeshiva. Shanghai The yeshiva in the Beth Aharon Synagogue, Shanghai; Shmuelevitz is seated in the front row, second from right Somehow, Rav Shmuelevitz became responsible for the financial needs of all Jewish learning institutions in the city, not just his own. These included contingents of the famed yeshivas of Kamenetz, Kletzk, Lubavitch, and Lublin. This was despite the fact that exchanging foreign currency in Shanghai was fraught with danger and Shmuelevitz lived with a perpetual fear of being apprehended by the authorities. A short while after arriving in Shanghai, Shmuelevitz received American visas only for himself and his family. He refused them, saying that he would leave only when all the students had received their visas. This ultimately meant staying in Shanghai for five and a half years. These and other details were part of the 1966 testimony given by Shmulevitz and his wife to Yad VaShem. Move to Jerusalem In 1947 the yeshiva moved again -- as always, as a single unit -- this time, to the United States, where Shmuelevitz spent six months before rejoining his father-in-law, Finkel, in the Mirrer Yeshiva in Jerusalem. For the next 32 years, until his death in 1978, Shmuelevitz remained in Mir-Jerusalem. He became active in Agudath Israel in Israel, and its Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (Council of Torah Sages) on which he served. He also became the father-in-law of Nochum Partzovitz, his successor as rosh yeshiva. Personality Shmuelevitz was well known for his ability to become totally engrossed in his Torah study for hours at a time. His ethical discourses, many of which have been published in English, are considered classics. They offer novel interpretations and reveal his penetrating insights into human nature. Shmuelevitz had great respect for his father and he quoted him often in both Torah lectures and mussar discourses. He considered his father's handwritten Torah chiddushim (new Torah insights) his most valued possessions. During the Six-Day War, when the yeshiva was within range of Jordanian artillery fire, Shmuelevitz sent some of the manuscripts to America with his uncle, Avraham Yoffen, with specific instructions that he carry them by hand and not put them in his luggage, because, \\"Dos iz meyn gantze leben (This is my whole life).\\" Family His youngest son, Meir Shmulevitz, lives in Kiryat Mattersdorf, Jerusalem, and his son Avrohom is a Rosh mesivta at the Mirrer Yeshiva. Both were born in Israel. Final days His gravesite at Har HaMenuchot. A few days after Sukkot 1978, Shmuelevitz was rushed to the hospital and, for the next two months, was gravely ill. Moshe Feinstein said, \\"The world rested upon Reb Chaim's shoulders.\\" Jews worldwide prayed for his recovery. Two months later on the third of Tevet,his 49th wedding anniversary Shmuelevitz died at the age of 76. Nearly 100,000 mourners attended his funeral. He is buried on Har HaMenuchot. During his lifetime, Shmuelevitz committed to paper his every lecture and public address, leaving behind at his death thousands of handwritten pages, including chiddushim on every tractate of the Talmud.
