D'Annunzio was an Italian nationalist and poet who is considered a proto-fascist. Proto-fascism refers to the direct predecessor ideologies and cultural movements that influenced and formed the basis of fascism.Spackman, Barbara: Fascist Virilities: Rhetoric, Ideology, and Social Fantasy in Italy, p. 78.Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge. p. 94. A prominent proto-fascist figure is Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Italian nationalist whose politics influenced Benito Mussolini and Italian Fascism. Proto-fascist political movements include the Italian Nationalist Association (Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, ANI), the German National Association of Commercial Employees (Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfen-Verband, DHV) and the German National People's Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei, DNVP). Precedents for modern fascism can be seen in the cultures and governments of older nations which were heavily based on a desire to maintain law and order, such as the Roman Empire and the anciens r√©gimes of Europe. Other people who have been labeled proto-fascist because they shared an ideological basis with fascism include: * Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881)Ulrich Broich, H. T. Dickinson, Eckhart Hellmuth, Martin Schmidt: Reactions to Revolutions: The 1790s and Their Aftermath, p. 255 * Charles Maurras (1868-1952) * Ion Dragoumis (1878-1920)John Mazis, A Man For All Seasons: The Uncompromising Life of Ion Dragoumis * Patrick Pearse (1879-1916) * Edgar Julius Jung (1894-1934) * D. H. Lawrence (1885‚Äì1930). The English philosopher Bertrand Russell characterized Lawrence as a \\"proto-German fascist\\" Bertrand Russell. The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1872-1914 (Little, Brown and company, 1951) page 112. This complex characterization is useful as a demarcation point between Fascism and proto-fascism. The former has totalitarian uniformity as its paradigm, but Russell is referring to Lawrence as a \\"nonconformist prophet\\" struggling with individual alienation, looking to the shared identity of ancestral blood and soil for reconnection i.e. an evolution of the German 19th-century V√∂lkisch movement.

Figueroa, who began his political career as an advocate of Puerto Rican Independence, was the co-founder of the \\"Independence Association\\", one of three political organizations which merged to form the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Figueroa, had changed political ideals and in 1948, was a member of the Partido Estadista Puertorrique√±o (Puerto Rican Statehood Party). That year, he was the only member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives who did not belong to the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD), and the only Representative to oppose the PPD's approval of what became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law), which violated the civil rights of those who favored Puerto Rican Independence. On December 22, 2006, the Puerto Rican Legislature approved a law declaring every September 21, Leopoldo Figueroa Carreras Day.Ley N√∫m. 282 del a√±o 2006 Early years Figueroa (birth name: Leopoldo Figueroa Carreras) was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico when the island was still a Spanish Colony. He became interested in politics at an early age due to the influences of his father who was a personal friend of the Puerto Rican political leader Luis Mu√±oz Rivera and his uncle Sotero Figueroa, a close friend of Cuban revolutionary leader Jos√© Mart√≠. In 1898, when he was 11 years old, the United States invaded Puerto Rico. Some Puerto Rican leaders such as Jos√© de Diego and Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos expected the United States to grant the island its independence. However, this did not concur with the Monroe Doctrine, or the geopolitical interests of the United States. Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 ratified on December 10, 1898, Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States. Spain had lost its last colony in the western hemisphere, and the United States gained imperial strength and global presence. When he was 14 years old, he began participating in the political activities of the \\"Puerto Rican Federal Party\\", a party which supported greater self-rule for the island founded by Mu√±oz Rivera. His interest in journalism was influenced by his uncle who was the manager of \\"Patria\\", a newspaper founded by Mart√≠. Supporter of independence Figueroa became active in the Union Party of Puerto Rico, founded in February 1904 by Luis Mu√±oz Rivera, Rosendo Matienzo Cintr√≥n, Antonio R. Barcel√≥, Jos√© de Diego, and others after the disbanding of the Federal Party. It supported greater self-government for the island but was divided between pro- independence and pro-statehood factions. Figueroa supported independence and belonged to the Unionist subcommittee of the town of Cata√±o. In 1906, Figueroa decided to study medicine at the University of Havana, in Cuba but not without having published the article \\"Adios Patria\\" (\\"Good-Bye My Nation\\") in the newspaper \\"El Eco de Cata√±o,\\" an article in which he promised to return and to fight for his country against the new tyrant, the United States. During his stay in Cuba, he resided with his uncle Sotero Figueroa and befriended various self-exiled Puerto Ricans like Lola Rodr√≠guez de Ti√≥ and Sergio Cuevas Zequeira. Figueroa earned his medical degree in 1910 and returned to Puerto Rico. He continued in his political activities upon his return to the island. In the 1912 Union Party Assembly in Mayag√ºez, Figueroa presented a motion to expel the members who favored US statehood for Puerto Rico. His motion was opposed by party leaders Herminio D√≠az Navarro, Rafael Cuevas Zequeira and Mart√≠n Travieso and was not accepted. In the 1914 elections, he was elected to the Camera of Delegates in representation of the District of San Juan. The same year, Barcel√≥, Mu√±oz Rivera and de Diego were members of an executive council that attempted to form an alliance between the Union and Republican Parties. In 1915, Figueroa and Jos√© De Diego traveled to the Dominican Republic and Cuba with the intention of organizing a Union of the Antilles and to gather support for Puerto Rican Independence movement. By 1920, Figueroa was disillusioned with the party leadership and, together with Jos√© S. Alegr√≠a (the father of Ricardo Alegr√≠a) and Eugenio Font Su√°rez, founded the Independence Association of Puerto Rico. The Independence Association merged with Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠'s Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico and the Nationalist Youth political organization, to form the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. In the 1920/elections, he was elected to the position of Commissioner of Public Service. In 1924, the Union Party joined with dissident members of the Republican Party to form the Alianza (\\"Alliance\\"). It generally supported autonomy for Puerto Rico. Figueroa was re-elected to the same political position as before but now as member of the new political organization. Besides his political obligations, Figueroa continued to practice his medical profession as director of the Maternity Hospital in San Juan. In 1928, he published a medical treatise, \\"Mortalidad infantil\\".Puerto Rico Encyclopedia Change to supporter of statehood Figueroa began to doubt that the United States would grant Puerto Rico its independence and that said ideals were more wishful thinking then realistic. He realized that with the passage of the Jones-Shafroth Act, which imposed a conditional US citizenship upon the people of Puerto Rico, who had neither asked for nor wanted it, made it clear that the United States had no intentions of granting Puerto Rico independence.World of 1898, Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War His doubts lead him to embrace the idea that Puerto Rico would eventually become a \\"state\\" of the United States of America. He then began to associate himself with political organizations whose ideals were pro-statehood.\\"Hombres de Primera Plana (1958)\\", by: Teofilo Maldonado; p√°gina 136. He then decided to study law at the University of Puerto Rico and in 1927, he earned his degree. The Alliance Party did not last long, as a united political organization and was soon divided into two factions, one that believed in independence and later became the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico, the other being pro-statehood. Figueroa joined the latter and later the pro- statehood Puerto Rican Republican Party, also known as the Partido Estadista de Puerto Rico, founded in 1899, by Dr. Jos√© Celso Barbosa. The party was renamed in 1930, Republican Union. He was elected to Puerto Rican House of Representatives in 1933 and in 1940, representing the districts of Bayam√≥n- Cata√±o-Guaynabo. On August 19, 1944, he was named vice president of his party.Sal√≥n de Audiencias Leopoldo Figueroa Carreras Puerto Rico's Gag Law On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the island. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill that day.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948‚Äì2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. It now was a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government or to organize any society, group, or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of US$10,000 (), or both. According to Figueroa, the only non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and violated the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law violated the civil rights of Puerto Ricans.La Gobernaci√≥n de Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero y la Guerra Fr√≠a New Progressive Party Figueroa was elected to the Puerto Rican Senate in 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964, representing the Republican Union. He was a member of the Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico (1951‚Äì1952). On January 22, 1967, the Republican Union called for an assembly to discuss the Puerto Rican status issue. A result of the meeting was the creation of the political organization \\"Estadistas Unidos\\" (United Statehooders) which was renamed \\"Partido Nuevo Progressita\\" (PNP or New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico), presided by Luis A. Ferr√©. Figueroa joined the new organization and served in the House of Representatives and also as the organizations first representative in the Board of the State Elections.\\"Historia Pol√≠tica de Puerto Rico (2003); By: Antonio Qui√±ones Calder√≥n In 1968, Luis A.

Early life  Brooks was born in Wright City, Missouri. He was the son of Arlington Rand Brooks (1867 ‚Äì1950), a farmer.Arlington Rand Brooks. Missouri Death Certificates, 1910-1969. Accessed 2020-03-27. He and his mother moved to Los Angeles when he was four, though he continued to spend summers in Wright City. Brooks continued to make visits to his hometown of Wright City into the 1950s, up to and following the death of his father in 1950. His mother and his grandfather were actors. Career  Early career  After leaving school, Brooks got a screen test at MGM and was given a bit part in Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938). His big fame came with his part as Charles Hamilton in Gone with the Wind (1939), a role which he later admitted he despised; he wanted to play more macho parts. He made $100 per week under contract at MGM, but when he was on loan to Selznick International Pictures for Gone with the Wind, he made $500 per week. After Gone With the Wind, he had relatively small parts in other movies including Babes in Arms, then a regular role as Lucky in the Hopalong Cassidy series of westerns in the mid 1940s; Brooks succeeded Russ Hayden in the role. Among the films, which starred William Boyd as Hopalong, were Hoppy's Holiday, The Dead Don't Dream, and Borrowed Trouble. He received positive notice for his work in Fool's Gold, with Variety reporting that he did \\"an excellent job.\\" In edited, half-hour versions of some of the films, he appeared in twelve of the 52 episodes of the Hopalong Cassidy television series.  Military service  Brooks served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, eventually reaching the rank of Sergeant. He trained at Buckley Field in Colorado, in March 1943 and was stationed in Springfield, Missouri as of May 1943. Brooks was for a time at San Antonio Air Field. He trained for flying but did some theatre work under General Arnold. He was ill for a time during his service and in 1944 worked in recruitment in Louisiana.  Post-military film and television work  In 1948, he co-starred with Adele Jergens and Marilyn Monroe in the low- budget black-and-white Columbia Pictures film, Ladies of the Chorus. Brooks became the first actor to share an on-screen kiss with Monroe, who in a few years would be one of the world's biggest movie stars. Filmed in just ten days, the film was released soon after its completion. Variety called his performance in the 1952 film The Steel Fist \\"capable.\\" Television brought new opportunities, again often in westerns. He played Cpl. Randy Boone in the 1950s television series, The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin. Brooks had guest roles in 1950s western series, including Mackenzie's Raiders, The Lone Ranger, Maverick, Gunsmoke, and Bonanza. He appeared twice on the syndicated adventure series, Rescue 8, as well as on CBS's Perry Mason courtroom drama series. He directed and produced a movie about brave dogs, Bearheart, but the film was entangled in legal troubles due to his business manager's involvement in crimes such as forgery and graft. The film was never released. Brooks was one of the favorite leading men of Jane Withers.  Post-entertainment career  After he left show business, Brooks ran a private ambulance company in Glendale, California. He commented that he \\"died in more pictures than almost anyone\\" and that though he was never very big in show business, he was willing to return to it. Brooks sold ambulance company in 1994 and retired to his ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley where he bred champion Andalusian horses. He attended a Gone with the Wind reunion for Clark Gable's birthday, along with Ann Rutherford and Fred Crane, in Cadiz, Ohio in 1992.  Personal life  Variety reported that Brooks married Clover Barrick on April 18, 1945. He married Lois Laurel (d. 2017), daughter of Stan Laurel, in 1949. Their son Arlington Rand Brooks III was born in September 1949. Their daughter Laurel was born in August 1950 in Santa Monica, California. Death Brooks died in Santa Ynez, California, twenty days before his 85th birthday. He was survived by his wife, Hermine, and his two children, Randy (1949-2016) and Laurel, by his marriage to Lois Laurel.

He is a teacher, lecturer, podcaster, and author. In 2011, Newsweek ranked him among the 50 most prominent rabbis in the United States, stating that \\"Linzer‚Äôs students now hold some of the most prominent positions in shuls and Hillels all over the country\\" and that his school's \\"alumni will undoubtedly alter the fabric of Modern Orthodoxy.\\" In 2008, Linzer received the prestigious Avi Chai Fellowship, awarded to emerging communal and educational leaders.  Yeshivat Chovevei Torah  Linzer has been the Rabbinic Head of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah since its founding in 1999. He was named its dean, assuming ultimate responsibility of both the religious studies and the professional training, in October, 2007. He is recognized as a left leaning, novel styled scholar in the community, and is the primary architect of the school's innovative curriculum. In 2018 Rabbi Linzer was appointed as President of the yeshiva while continuing to serve as its Rabbinic Head. Linzer also teaches Halakha and Jewish Thought to the school's rabbinical students. In 2008, Linzer's Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, together with JOFA and the Drisha Institute sponsored a conference entitled \\"Demystifying Sex and Teaching Halacha: A Kallah (Jewish Bridal) Teacher‚Äôs Workshop,\\" to bring frank talk about sex and sexuality into the requisite classes taken by Orthodox brides prior to their wedding. This conference was held again in 2011, with a second cohort of 15 bridal teachers from around the US and Israel. Linzer delivers a daily Daf Yomi class to men and women, available on iTunes and YouTube.  Two-Ring Ceremony  In 2003, Linzer wrote an article, \\"Towards a More Balanced Wedding Ceremony,\\", describing ways of creating a more gender-balanced wedding ceremony while keeping within the letter and the spirit of Jewish Law. His most innovative suggestion was that of a halakhic two-ring ceremony, informally known as the \\"Linzer Two-Ring Ceremony.\\", A standard Orthodox wedding ceremony has only the groom giving a ring to the bride and does not allow for the bride to give a ring to the groom other than in a purely symbolic fashion after the ceremony was completed. In contrast, Linzer's model has the bride giving a ring immediately after the groom does so, in the presence of witnesses, and serving a substantive halakhic (Jewish legal) function. This ceremony is seeing increasing use among liberal Orthodox couples.  Public Positions  Linzer has taken a public stand on a number of controversial issues within the Orthodox Jewish community. In 2006, he was the only Orthodox rabbi to go on record supporting the naming of Dina NajmanOrthodox Jewish feminism#Spiritual Leadership as spiritual leader of the Orthodox congregation, Kehilat Orach Eliezer. Linzer, together with his wife, Devorah Zlochower, has been outspoken about the Orthodox community's responsibility to address children of special needs in its schools, synagogues and communal institutions, . At Linzer's Chovevei Torah, rabbinical students receive special training in inclusion for people with physical, developmental and learning disabilities. In 2010, a paper commissioned by the Rabbinical Council of America voiced serious reservations as to the validity of brain-stem death as the Jewish legal definition of death. The rejection of this definition would make almost all organ-transplants forbidden by Jewish Law. Linzer authored a \\"Rabbinic Statement Regarding Organ Donation and Brain Death\\", reaffirming the legitimacy of the brain-death definition and critiquing those who would be prepared to receive organs but refuse to donate them. This statement was signed by over 100 rabbis, including some of the most prominent Modern Orthodox rabbis in the U.S. and Israel. The RCA subsequently backed away from the implications of its paper. The Agudath Israel of America then issued a statement which affirmed the halakhic validity of the original 2010 paper commissioned by the RCA as reflecting the position of \\"a majority of major poskim today\\". This, in turn, prompted Tradition (journal) to publish a philosophical analysis of the merits of both Rabbi Linzer's and the Agudath Israel of America's respective statements.

These are sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies. Distinguishing characteristics The Tucker & Tenorio 2009 taxonomy distinguishes Ketyconus from Conus in the following ways:Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J. (2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Ketyconus da Motta, 1991 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is turgid in shape with subangulate shoulders. The protoconch is paucispiral. The whorl tops are not concave, are ornamented with cords, and nodules are absent. The anal notch is shallow, an anterior notch is absent, and a dentiform plait may be present. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is moderate in size. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radular tooth is substantially longer than the posterior section, and the blade is relatively short being less than one-third the length of the anterior section. A basal spur is present, the barb is short. The radular tooth has one or two rows of large serrations flanked by multiple rows of smaller serrations. ::Geographical distribution :::The only species in this genus is endemic to the South African region. ::Feeding habits :::These cone snails are presumed to be vermivorous, meaning that the cones prey on polychaete worms, based upon the radular tooth morphology.

The Constitution of Serbia defines it as a secular state with guaranteed religious freedom. Eastern Orthodox Christians comprise 84.5% of country's population with 6,079,396 members. The Serbian Orthodox Church is the largest and traditional church of the country, adherents of which are overwhelmingly Serbs. Public schools in Serbia allow religious teaching, most commonly with the Serbian Orthodox Church. Serbian public holidays include the religious celebrations of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Other Orthodox Christian communities in Serbia include Montenegrins, Romanians, Vlachs, Macedonians and Bulgarians. The Catholic Church is prominent in north Vojvodina amongst the Hungarian minority. Protestantism is most largely found in Slovak populations within Baƒçki Petrovac and Kovaƒçica. Christianity first arrived in Serbia in the 9th century. It became state-religion in the 9th century when Serbia began to identify as a Christian country. In a 2011 census, 91.22% of Serbians identified as Christian. History Early Christianity Saints Florus and Laurus are venerated as Christian martyrs, and lived in the 2nd century in Ulpiana (Lipljan), in modern Serbia. According to traditions, they were twin brothers from Constantinople who were employed to build a pagan temple. They gave their salaries to the poor and are said to have cured the son of Mamertin, the local pagan priest, who then converted to Christianity. The temple was reconstructed into a Church, which prompted local pagans to kill the 300 Christians, including all aforementioned. During the Diocletianic Persecution in 304, Sirmium became a place of martyrdom for saint Irenaeus, Anastasia and Fausta. Not much before 313 while emperor Licinius was present in Singidunum, he oversaw trial and murder of deacon Hermylus and Stratonicus whose bodies were thrown in the Danube but resurfaced downriver and were later buried by Christians and venerated as saints. Successor of Irenaeus as bishop of Sirmium was Domnus who attended the First Council of Nicaea. By the mid 4th century, Christian communities on territory of modern-day Serbia were numerous and influential. Sirmium, Singidunum, Naissus, Viminacium, Remesiana, Horreum Margi, Margum and Ulpiana are all mentioned as bishoprics by 343. Bishops Germinius of Sirmium and Ursacius of Singidunum were influential in then ongoing Arian controversy. Four ecclestiastical Councils of Sirmium were important events for whole Christendom. Bishop Nicetas of Remesiana during his long tenure (366-420) contributed much to the spread of Christianity in the region and earliest mention of monastic communities dates from his time. After the Edict of Milan (313), Kosovo and Metohia came under the jurisdiction of the Thessalonian vicariate; indicated in a letter from Pope Innocent I to the Thessalonian vicar Rufus in 412 that the vicariate included the area of Dardania. Bishopric of Sirmium lost much influence once Huns raided the city in 441/442. In 535 a new archdiocese of Justiniana Prima was formed and was given jurisdiction over most of aforementioned bishoprics. Many new churches and basilicas were built during the reign of emperor Justinian I. However mere decades later entire established ecclesiastic structure collapsed under the impact of Avar raids and Slavic settlement that followed. The last known archbishop of Justiniana Prima and indeed of any bishopric on territory of modern-day Serbia for centuries to come was Ioannes (c. 595-602/3) Early Middle Ages The Serbs were baptised during the reign of Heraclius (610‚Äì641) by \\"elders of Rome\\" according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus in his annals (r. 913‚Äì959). In 733, Leo III attaches Illyricum to Patriarch Anastasius of Constantinople.A collection of dated Byzantine lead seals, page 47: \\"733... Church of Constantinople\\" The forming of Christianity as state-religion dates to the time of Eastern Orthodox missionaries (Saints) Cyril and Methodius during Basil I (r. 867‚Äì886), who baptised the Serbs sometime before sending imperial admiral Nikita Orifas to Knez Mutimir for aid in the war against the Saracens in 869, after acknowledging the suzerainty of the Byzantine Empire. The fleets and land forces of Zahumlje, Travunia and Konavli were sent to fight the Saracens who attacked the town of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) in 869, on the immediate request of Basil I, who was asked by the Ragusians for help. A Serbian bishopric (Diocese of Ras) may have been founded in Stari Ras in 871 by Serbian Knez Mutimir, confirmed by the Council of Constantinople in 879‚Äì80. The adherence is evident in the tradition of theophoric names in the next generation of Serbian monarchs and nobles; Petar Gojnikoviƒá, Stefan Mutimiroviƒá, Pavle Branoviƒá. Mutimir maintained the communion with the Eastern Church (Constantinople) when Pope John VIII invited him to recognize the jurisdiction of the bishopric of Sirmium. The Serbs and Bulgarians adopt the Old Slavonic liturgy instead of the Greek.De Administrando ImperioThe wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins Notable early church buildings include the monastery of Archangel Michael in Prevlaka (Ilovica), built in the beginning of the 9th century, on the location of older churches of three-nave structure with three apses to the East, dating from the 3rd and 6th centuries, Bogorodica Hvostanska (6th century) and Church of Saints Peter and Paul. A Seal of Strojimir (died between 880‚Äì896), the brother of Mutimir, was bought by the Serbian state in an auction in Germany. The seal has a Patriarchal cross in the center and Greek inscriptions that say: \\"Strojimir\\" (CTPOHMIP) and \\"God, Help Serbia\\". In 1019, the Archbishopric of Ohrid is formed after the Byzantines conquers the First Bulgarian Empire. The Greek language replaces the Slavic. Serbia is ecclesiastically administered into several dioceses; The Diocese of Ras, mentioned in 1019, becomes part of the Ohrid archbishopric and encompassed the areas of central Serbia, by the rivers Raska, Ibar and Lim, evident in the second charter of Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025). Among the first bishops are Leontius (fl. 1123-1126), Cyril (fl. 1141‚Äì1143), Euthemius (fl. 1170) and Kalinik (fl. 1196). It joined the autocephalous Archbishopric of Zica in 1219, at the time of Saint Sava.Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Raska and Prizren The Diocese (Eparhy) of Prizren is mentioned in 1019, in the first charter of Basil II. Denominations Eastern Orthodoxy St. Mark's Church, Belgrade Most of the citizens of Serbia are adherents of the Serbian Orthodox Church, while the Romanian Orthodox Church is also present in parts of Vojvodina inhabited by ethnic Romanian minority. Besides Serbs, other adherents of Eastern Orthodoxy include: Romanians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Russians, Greeks and Vlachs. The identity of ethnic Serbs was historically largely based on Eastern Orthodoxy and on the Serbian Orthodox Church, to the extent that some Serb nationalists claimed that those who are not its faithful are not Serbs. However, the conversion of the south Slavs from paganism to Christianity took place before the Great Schism, the split between the Greek East and the Latin West. After the Schism, those who lived under the Eastern Orthodox sphere of influence became Orthodox and those who lived under the Catholic sphere of influence became Catholic. Some ethnologists consider that the distinct Serb and Croat identities relate to religion rather than ethnicity. With the arrival of the Ottoman Empire, some Serbs and Croats converted to Islam. This was particularly, but not wholly, so in Bosnia. The best known Muslim Serb is probably either Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá or Me≈°a Selimoviƒá. Serbian Orthodox Church The church is one of the autocephalous Orthodox Christian churches, ranking sixth in order of seniority after Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Russia. It is the second oldest Slavic Orthodox Church in the world (after the Bulgarian Orthodox Church).Eparhija-dalmatinska.hr The Eastern Orthodox Church is the dominant church in Serbia, Montenegro and Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with more than 84% of the population being adherents in all three. It is organized into metropolises and eparchies located primarily in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Croatia, but also in surrounding countries, and all over the world. Since many Serbs have emigrated to foreign countries, there are now Serbian Orthodox communities worldwide. The Serbian Orthodox Church is an autocephalous, or ecclesiastically independent, member of the Eastern Orthodox communion. The Serbian Patriarch serves as first among equals in his church; the current patriarch is Irinej. The Church achieved autocephalous status in 1219 under the leadership of St. Sava, becoming independent Archbishopric of ≈Ωiƒça. Its status was elevated to that of a patriarchate in the 14th century, and was known afterwards as the Patriarchate of Peƒá. This patriarchate was abolished by the Ottoman Turks in the 1766 century. The modern Serbian Orthodox Church was established in 1920 after the unification of the Patriarchate of Karlovci and the Metropolitanate of Belgrade. The Serbian Orthodox Church owns many significant Christian relics, such as the right hand of John the Baptist, Saint George's hand and skull parts,–°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∞ : –ú–æ—à—Ç–∏ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≥ –Ç–æ—Ä—í–∞ —É –ü—Ä–æ–∫—É–ø—ô—É : –ü–û–õ–ò–¢–ò–ö–ê Holy Cross segments, St. Paraskevi's finger and body of St. Basil of Ostrog, among others. Catholic church in Subotica Catholic Church Prayer House of Nazarene Christian Community in Novi Sad The Catholic Church is present mostly in the northern part of Vojvodina, notably in the municipalities with Hungarian ethnic majority and in the polyethnic municipalities of Subotica and Beƒçej. The ethnic groups whose members are mostly adherents of the Catholic Church are: Hungarians, Croats, Bunjevci, Germans, Slovenes, Czechs, ≈†okci, Poles, etc. A smaller number of Romani, Yugoslavs, and Slovaks are also adherents of the Catholic Church. In the disputed region of Kosovo, Catholics constitute 2.2% of the population, according to the 2011 census. The ethnic Rusyns and a smaller part of the ethnic Ukrainians are adherents of the Eastern Catholic Church. Protestant Christianity The largest concentration of the Protestant Christians in Serbia is in the municipalities of Baƒçki Petrovac and Kovaƒçica, where the absolute or relative majority of the population are ethnic Slovaks, most of them adherents of Protestant Christianity. Some members of other ethnic groups (especially Serbs in absolute terms and Hungarians and Germans in proportional terms) are also adherents of various forms of Protestant Christianity. There are various Protestant groups in the country, including Methodists, Seventh- day Adventists and Evangelical Baptists (Nazarene). Many of these groups are situated in the culturally diverse province of Vojvodina. Prior to World War II, the number of Protestants in the region was larger. Western Orthodox Church The Western Orthodox (before 1985 known as Old Catholic) Church existed in Yugoslavia since 1921. Nowadays, the only representative of Old Catholic Churches in Serbia is Orthodox - Old Catholic General vicariate of St. Methodius, a canonically established organ of World Council of National Old Catholic Churches (distinct from The Utrecht Union). It is a member of World Council of Churches and was granted autonomy. In 2015., General Vicariate of St. Methodius was recognized as a legal successor of former Western Orthodox Church in Yugoslavia, because they share the same dogmas. Serbian Orthodox Church doesn't look at General Vicariate as its sister church, but as an opponent. Jehovah's Witnesses The Jehovah's Witnesses are active in Serbia since 1930. This community have its seat in Zemun. In 1937, the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia banned the activity of the community, but it was reestablished in 1953. According to 2002 census, there was 2,191 Jehovah's Witnesses in Serbia, while according to 2009 estimation their number was 3,871.Zorica Kuburiƒá, Verske zajednice u Srbiji i verska distanca, Novi Sad, 2010, pages 211-212. Latter Day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are active in Serbia since 1992 and Seat of the LDS community in Serbia is in Belgrade. There is also LDS meetinghouse in Novi Sad. The Book of Mormon is also translated into Serbian language and printed in Serbian Cyrillic script.

It was a predecessor to the Republic of China's National Highway System.  Route  Starting in Taipei at what is now Taipei Gymnasium, the MacArthur Thruway headed east along Nanjing East Road, intersected with Keelung Road at Zhengqi Bridge, and crossed the Keelung River. From there, it went through Neihu, Xizhi, and Qidu, ending in Keelung at the intersection of Xiao 2nd Road (Â≠ù‰∫åË∑Ø) and Zhong 4th Road (Âø†ÂõõË∑Ø). The length was . To handle the heavy traffic between Taipei and Keelung, the road was designed as a controlled-access highway, with 32 bridges, 12 interchanges, and one tunnel called the Zhongxing Tunnel. The tolls for using the road were NT$10 for large vehicles, NT$5 for small vehicles, and NT$1 for military vehicles. Tricycles, motorcycles, and bicycles were prohibited. Originally the speed limits were set to 80 km/h for flat sections and 60 km/h for hilly sections, but this was soon changed to 100 km/h and 80 km/h, respectively.  History  Construction of the MacArthur Thruway began in May 1962, took two years, and cost NT$260 million, including aid from the United States. The road opened on May 2, 1964. Originally, it was to be named Beiji 2nd Road (), and it was later renamed Beiji Xin Road (). After General Douglas MacArthur died a month before the road opened, the road was renamed in his honor. Unfortunately, the road was plagued with accidents. It was less than wide, with only one lane in each direction. There was no median to separate oncoming traffic, nor were there barriers along the side of the road. Traffic safety was not a well developed concept. Finally, the quality of the construction was poor. These factors led to a total of 51 accidents and casualties of 273 people within the first two years of the road's opening. The 1979 opening of National Highway 1 superseded most of the MacArthur Thruway. The main remaining section is from the MacArthur 1st Bridge to the Neihu Interchange of National Highway 1, about long. In 1980, it was renamed Section 6, Nanjing East Road. The frontage road along this section was also renamed to Section 6, Nanjing East Road in 2009. The other remaining sections are parts of Kangning Street in Xizhi District, New Taipei and Lane 253, Shijian Road in Qidu District, Keelung. Since 2019, two bridges of the latter are being reconstructed because of their aged, insecure and narrow structure.

It was also the first large, organized march on Washington for political purposes. The procession was organized by the suffragists Alice Paul and Lucy Burns for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Planning for the event began in Washington in December 1912. The parade's purpose, stated in its official program, was to \\"march in a spirit of protest against the present political organization of society, from which women are excluded.\\" Participation numbers vary between 5,000 and 10,000 marchers. Suffragists and supporters marched down Pennsylvania Avenue on Monday, March 3, 1913, the day before President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. Paul had selected the venue and date to maximize publicity, but met resistance from the D.C. police department. The demonstration consisted of a procession with floats, bands, and various groups representing women at home, in school, and in the workplace. At the Treasury Building, a pageant of allegorical tableaux was acted out during the parade. The final act was a rally at the Memorial Continental Hall with prominent speakers, including Anna Howard Shaw and Helen Keller. Prior to the event, the issue of black participation in the march threatened to cause a rift with delegations from Southern states. Some blacks did march with state delegations. A group from Howard University participated in the parade. It is often said that black women were segregated at the back of the parade, however, contemporaneous sources confirm they marched with their respective state delegations or professional groups. During the procession, district police failed to keep the enormous crowd off the street, impeding the marchers' progress. Many participants were subjected to heckling from spectators, though there were also many supporters present. The marchers were finally assisted by citizens' groups and eventually the cavalry. The police were subjected to a congressional inquiry due to security failures. The event premiered Paul's campaign to refocus the suffrage movement on obtaining a national constitutional amendment for woman's suffrage. Intended to pressure President Wilson to support an amendment, he resisted their demands for years afterward. The procession was featured in the film Iron Jawed Angels in 2004. A new U.S. ten-dollar bill with parade imagery is planned for circulation in 2026. Background Officers of the NAWSA about 1916. Front row: Mrs. Wood Park, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Mrs. Helen H. Gardner: second row, Miss Rose Emmet Young, Mrs. George Bass, and Miss Ruth White. American suffragists Alice Paul and Lucy Burns spearheaded a drive to adopt a national strategy for women's suffrage in the National American Woman Suffrage Association.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 126. Paul and Burns had seen first-hand the effectiveness of militant activism while working for Emmeline Pankhurst in the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in Britain. Their education included rallies, marches, and demonstrations, knowledge of which the two would put to work back in America. They already had first-hand experience with imprisonment as a backlash against suffrage activism. They had gone on hunger strikes and suffered force- feeding.Kraditor (1965). pp. 279-280. They were not afraid to be provocative, even knowing the potential consequences. The procession would be their first foray into moving into militant mode on a national stage.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 77. Paul and Burns found that there were many suffragists who supported the WSPU's militant tactics, including Harriot Stanton Blatch, Alva Belmont, Elizabeth Robins, and Rhetta Child Dorr.Ludardini (1986). pp. 7‚Äì8. Burns and Paul recognized that the women from the six states that had full suffrage at the time comprised a powerful voting bloc. They submitted a proposal to Anna Howard Shaw and the NAWSA leadership at their annual convention in 1912. The leadership was not interested in changing the state- by-state strategy and rejected the idea of holding a campaign that would hold the Democratic Party responsible. Paul and Burns appealed to prominent reformer Jane Addams, who interceded on their behalf, resulting in Paul being appointed chair of the Congressional Committee.Lunardini (1986). pp. 20-21. Up until this time, the woman's suffrage movement had relied on oratory and written arguments to keep the issue before the public. Paul believed that it was time to add a strong visual element to the campaign, even grander than what she had planned for the NAWSA 1912 conference.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 128. While her tactics were non-violent, Paul exploited elements of danger in her events.Adams and Keene (2008). pp. 98, 116. Her plan for using visual rhetoric was intended to have lasting impact.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 76. She felt it was time for women to stop begging for suffrage and demand it with political coercion instead.Kraditor (1965). pp. 231‚Äì232.Stevens (1920). p. 13. Though the suffragists had staged marches in many cities,Zahniser and Fry (2014). pp. 130-134. this would be a first for Washington, D.C. It would also be the first large political demonstration in the nation's capital. The only previous similar demonstration was made by a group of 500 men known as Coxey's Army, who had protested about unemployment in 1894. At the time Paul and Burns were assigned to lead the Congressional Committee of the NAWSA, it was merely a shadow committee headed by Elizabeth Kent, wife of a California congressman, with an annual budget of ten dollars that mostly went unspent.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 78. With Paul and Burns in charge, the committee revived the push for a national suffrage amendment.Wheeler, ed. (1995). p. 305. At the end of 1913, Paul reported to the NAWSA that the committee had raised and expended over $25,000 on the suffrage cause for the year.Stevens (1920). p. 28. Paul and Burns persuaded NAWSA to endorse an immense suffrage parade in Washington, D.C., to coincide with newly elected President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration the following March. The NAWSA leadership turned over the entire operation to the committee.Lunardini (1986). p.21-22. They organized volunteers, planned, and raised funds in preparation for the parade with little help from the NAWSA.Lunardini (1986). pp. 22-24.  Planning  Nina Allender; second from right is Hazel MacKaye; far right Elsie Hill. Front row (L to R): Glenna Tinnin, Helen Gardener, Alice Paul, Elizabeth Thatcher Kent, and Genevieve Stone.|alt=  Committees and recruiting  Once the board approved the parade in December 1912, it appointed Dora Lewis, Mary Ritter Beard, and Crystal Eastman to the committee, though they all worked outside of Washington. All money Paul collected had to be directed through the NAWSA, though she did not always comply.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 129. Paul arrived in Washington, D.C. in December 1912 to begin organizing the event. By the time the Congressional Committee had its first meeting on January 2, 1913, in its new Washington headquarters, more than 130 women showed up to start work. Using the list of former committee members, Paul found few still alive or in the city, but she did find assistance. Among local suffragists, she was aided by attorney Florence Etheridge and teacher Elsie Hill, daughter of a congressman. Kent, the former committee chair, was instrumental in opening doors in Washington to Paul and Burns. From the NAWSA, Paul recruited Emma Gillett and Helen Hamilton Gardener to be treasurer and publicity chair, respectively.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 127. Belva Lockwood, who had run for president in 1884, also attended the initial meeting.Lunardini (1986). p. 25. Paul recruited Hazel MacKaye to design professional floats and allegorical tableaux to be presented simultaneously with the procession.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 79. The parade was officially named the Woman Suffrage Procession, and the stated purpose per the event program was to \\"march in a spirit of protest against the present political organization of society, from which women are excluded.\\" Doris Stevens, who worked closely with Paul, stated that \\"...the procession was to dramatize in numbers and beauty the fact that women wanted to vote - that women were asking the Administration in power in the national government to speed the day.\\" The timing of the date for the procession, March 3, was important, because incoming president Woodrow Wilson, whose inauguration was to take place the following day, would be put on notice that this would be a key issue during his term, and Paul wanted to put pressure on him to support a national amendment. It also ensured that the procession would enjoy a large audience and publicity. Many factors deterred Paul regarding her selected date: District suffragists worried about the weather; the superintendent of police objected to the timing; even Paul herself was concerned about the need to attract a large number of marchers in a short time frame and get them organized. Fortunately, Washington had congressional delegations from all the states, and some of their wives could be counted on to represent those states. Likewise, the embassies could provide marchers from distant countries.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 133. In order to maximize the use of funds for publicity and building a national network, the Congressional Committee made it clear that participating organizations and delegations would need to fund their own travel, lodging, and other expenses.Lunardini (1986). p.26.  Parade route and security  Suffrage march line Just as the timing of the parade was tied to the inauguration, so too, was the route that Paul preferred in order to have the maximum impact on public perception. She requested a permit to march down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Peace Monument to the Treasury Building, then on to the White House before ending at Continental Hall.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 80. District superintendent of police, Major Richard H. Sylvester, offered a permit for Sixteenth Street, which would have taken the procession through a residential area, past several embassies.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 135. He later claimed he had thought the suffragists wished to hold the parade at night and the police could not have provided sufficient security if they marched from the Capitol. Sylvester pointed out the rough character of lower Pennsylvania Avenue and the type of people likely to attend the inauguration. Paul was not satisfied with his alternative route. She took her request to the District commissioners and the press. Eventually they relented and granted her request.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 136 Elsie Hill and her mother had also put some pressure on Sylvester by appealing to Elsie's father in Congress. Congress had the ultimate responsibility and funding control over the District police department. The presidential inauguration brought a huge influx of visitors from around the country. Media estimated crowds of a quarter to a half million people. Anticipating that most of these people would come to observe the suffrage parade, Paul was concerned about the ability of the local police force to handle the crowd; her disquiet proved to be justified by events. Sylvester had only volunteered a force of 100 officers, which Paul considered inadequate.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 142. She attempted to get intervention from President William Howard Taft, who referred her to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. The week before the parade, Congress passed a resolution directing district police to halt all traffic from the Peace Monument to 17th Street from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on the day of the parade and prevent any interference with the procession. Paul recruited a woman with political connections to intervene. Elizabeth Selden Rogers contacted her brother-in-law, Secretary Stimson, to request cavalry to provide additional security. He first claimed that it was prohibited to use the soldiers for that purpose, but later agreed to place troops on standby in case of emergency.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 143.  Countering anti-suffrage sentiments  Paul strategically chose to emphasize beauty, femininity, and traditional female roles in the procession. Her chosen theme for the procession was \\"Ideals and Virtues of American Womanhood\\".Adams and Keene (2008). p. 81. These characteristics were perceived by anti-suffragists as being most threatened by giving women the vote. She wanted to show that women could be all those things and still intelligent and competent to not only vote, but also to fill any other role in society. Attractiveness and professional talent were not mutually exclusive, and these ideals were embodied in the selection of the parade's herald, Inez Milholland, a labor lawyer from New York City who had been dubbed \\"the most beautiful suffragette\\".Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 145. Milholland had served in the same role in a suffrage march in the city the previous year.Adams (1967). p. 127. Anti-black racism The woman's suffrage movement, led in the nineteenth century by stalwart women such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, had its genesis in the abolitionist movement, but by the dawn of the twentieth century, Anthony's goal of universal suffrage was eclipsed by a near-universal racism in the United States.Kraditor (1965). footnote p. 164.Wheeler, ed. (1995). p. 147. While earlier suffragists had believed the two issues could be linked, the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and Fifteenth Amendment forced a division between African American rights and suffrage for women.Wheeler, ed. (1995). p. 31-32. In 1903, the NAWSA officially adopted a platform of states' rights that was intended to mollify and bring Southern U.S. suffrage groups into the fold. The statement's signers included Anthony, Carrie Chapman Catt and Anna Howard Shaw. This platform essentially nullified the issue of black rights and acknowledged that NAWSA considered (white) woman's suffrage to be the organization's primary goal.Kraditor (1965) pp. 163‚Äì166.Wheeler, ed. (1995). p. 148. With the prevalence of segregation throughout the country, and within organizations such as the NAWSA, blacks had formed their own activist groups to fight for their equal rights. Many were college educated and resented their exclusion from political power. The fiftieth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 also fell in 1913, giving them even further incentive to march in the suffrage parade.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 140. Two groups from Howard University, including the new Alpha chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, requested to join, and Paul assigned them to the college section of the parade, where she and Burns planned to march.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 141. The Howard University group included the former president from the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC), Mary Church Terrell.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 149. Ida B. Wells-Barnett marched with her state delegation despite being told to march with other blacks in another section. Paul, like many in the NAWSA, chose expedience over equal rights in planning the parade. She discussed participation with at least one local African American in the District and had reserved space in the parade for the NACWC and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).Adams and Keene (2008). p. 87. But the Virginia-born Gardener tried to persuade Paul that including blacks would be a bad idea. Paul took Gardener's concerns seriously and considered excluding blacks from the procession.Zahniser and Fry (2014). pp. 133‚Äì134, 138‚Äì139. Paul had attempted to keep news about black marchers out of the press, but when the Howard group announced they intended to participate, the public became aware of the conflict. A newspaper account indicated that Paul told some black suffragists that the NAWSA believed in equal rights for \\"colored women\\", but that some Southern women were likely to object to their presence. A source in the organization insisted that the official stance was to \\"permit negroes to march if they cared to\\". In a 1974 oral history interview, Paul recalled the \\"hurdle\\" of Terrell's plan to march, which upset the Southern delegations. She said the situation was resolved when a Quaker leading the men's section proposed the men march between the Southern groups and the Howard University group. While in Paul's memory, a compromise was reached to order the parade as southern women, then the men's section, and finally the Negro women's section, reports in the NAACP paper, The Crisis, depict events unfolding quite differently, with black women protesting the plan to segregate them. What is clear is that some groups attempted, on the day of the parade, to segregate their delegations.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 144. For example, a last-minute instruction by the chair of the state delegation section, Genevieve Stone, caused additional uproar when she asked the Illinois delegation's sole black member, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, to march with the segregated black group at the back of the parade. Some historians claim Paul made the request, though this seems unlikely after the official NAWSA decision. Wells-Barnett eventually rejoined the Illinois delegation as the procession moved down the avenue. In the end, black women marched in several state delegations, including New York and Michigan. Some joined in with their co-workers in the professional groups. There were also black men driving many of the floats. The spectators did not treat the black participants any differently.  The procession   The line-up of marchers  According to the media, the suffrage parade had become the primary draw over the inauguration itself. Special suffrage trains were hired to bring spectators from other cities, adding to the crowds in Washington. The novelty of the procession attracted enormous interest throughout the eastern U.S. As the parade participants gathered near the Peace Monument around noon, the police began roping off part of the parade route. Even before the parade began, the ropes were badly stretched and coming loose in places. The procession drew such a crowd that President-elect Wilson was mystified about why there were no people to be seen when he arrived in town that day.Stevens (1920). p. 21.alt=alt=Woman band in the Woman Suffrage Procession Jane Walker Burleson on horseback, accompanying a model of the Liberty Bell brought from Philadelphia, led the procession as Grand Marshal, immediately followed by the herald, Milholland, on a white horse. A pale-blue cape flowed over her white suit, held on by a Maltese cross.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 82. Her banner proclaimed \\"Forward into Light\\", a phrase originated by Pankhurst and later used by Blatch. Immediately behind the herald was a wagon that boldly stated \\"We Demand An Amendment To The Constitution Of The United States Enfranchising The Women Of This Country\\". Next was the national board of the NAWSA, headed by Shaw.Zahniser and Fry (2014). pp. 145‚Äì146. To add to the visual impact, Paul dictated a color scheme for each group of marchers. The rainbow of colors represented women coming into the light of the future out of the darkness of the past. To add drama between groups of marching women, \\"Paul recruited 26 floats, 6 golden chariots,10 bands, 45 captains, 200 marshals, 120 pages, 6 mounted heralds, and 6 mounted brigades\\", according to Adams and Keene. Estimates about the number of participants in the procession varied from 5,000 to 10,000.Flexner (1959). p. 272.Stevens (1920). p. 22. The first section had marchers and floats from countries where women already had the vote: Norway, Finland, Australia and New Zealand. The second section had floats depicting historic scenes from the suffrage movement in 1840, 1870, and 1890. Then came a float representing the state of the campaign in 1913 in a positive tableau of women inspiring a group of girls. A series of floats depicted men and women working side by side at home and in a variety of professions. They were followed by one with a man holding a representation of government on his shoulders while a woman with hands tied stood helpless at his side.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 86 A float depicted nurses, followed by a marching group of nurses. Groups of women representing traditional roles of motherhood and homemaking came next, in an effort to change the image of suffragists as being sexless working women.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 146. There followed a carefully orchestrated order of professional women, beginning with various nursing groups, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the PTA, before finally adding in non-traditional careers such as lawyers, artists, and businesswomen.Adams and Keene (2008). pp. 86‚Äì87. After a float depicting the Bill of Rights came a banner that showed the nine suffrage states in bright colors with the remaining states in black, a theme that was also graphically depicted using women dressed similarly. They carried a banner suggesting that vote-less women were slave to men with the vote, quoting Abraham Lincoln: \\"No Country Can Exist Half Slave and Half Free\\". Another Lincoln quote was featured at the top of the official program: \\"I go for all sharing the privilege of the government who assist in bearing its burdens, by no means excluding women.\\" Women from the suffrage states displayed their colorful organization banners on chariots that preceded each group.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 88. One prominent group featured in the procession was the pilgrims led by \\"General\\" Rosalie Jones. The brown-caped hikers covered more than from New York City to Washington in sixteen days. Their journey received considerable press coverage, and a large crowd assembled to greet them upon their arrival in the city on February 28.  Allegorical tableaux  Simultaneous with the procession, an allegorical tableaux unfolded on the Treasury Building's steps. The pageant was written by dramatist Hazel MacKaye and directed by Glenna Smith Tinnin.Woelfle, Gretchen (2009). \\"TAKING IT to the STREET.\\" Cobblestone. Retrieved 12 March 2015. These scenes were performed by silent actors to portray various attributes of patriotism and civic pride, ones that both men and women strove to emulate. The audience would recognize the presentation style from similar holiday events around the country. MacKaye set each scene using women clad in toga-style costumes and accompanied by symbolic parlor music that would also be familiar to the audience.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 89.German actress alt=The act began with a relay of trumpet calls from the Peace Monument to the Treasury Building. The first scene featured Columbia, who stepped forward on stage to the strains of \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\". She summoned Liberty, Charity, Justice, Hope and Peace to join her. In the final scene, Columbia placed herself as guardian over all these others and they assembled to watch the approaching procession of suffragists. By creating this stunning drama, Paul differentiated the American suffrage movement from Britain's \\"by fully appropriating the best possibilities of nonviolent visual rhetoric\\" per Adams and Keene.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 91.  Notable participants  Some of the women listed were well-known prior to the event, others became noteworthy later. Most names come from the official event program. * Dr. Nellie V.

Security failure  The parade and tableaux at the Treasury Building were scheduled to begin simultaneously at 3 p.m. However, the trumpet call starting the procession did not sound until 3:25 p.m. At the lead were several police escort vehicles and six mounted officers in a wedge formation. By the time the front of the parade reached 5th Street, the crowd had completely blocked the avenue. At that point, the police escort seemed to vanish into the throng. Milholland and others on horseback used the animals to help push back the crowds. Paul, Burns and other committee members brought a couple of automobiles to the front to help create a passage for the procession. The police had done little to open the parade route as they'd been ordered to do by Congress. Sylvester, who was at the train station awaiting Wilson's arrival, heard about the problem and put out the call to the cavalry unit on standby at Fort Myers. However, the mounted soldiers did not arrive on the scene until around 4:30 p.m. They were then able to usher the parade to its completion.Zanhniser and Fry (2014). p. 147. Male and female spectators surged into the street, though men were in the majority. There were both hecklers and supporters, but parade-marshal Burleson and other women in the procession were intimidated, particularly by the hostile chants. The Evening Star (Washington) published a review highlighting positive responses to the parade and pageant. The crush of people led to trampling: over 200 people were treated for injuries at local hospitals.The Washington Post, March 5, 1913; The New York Times, March 4‚Äì5, 1913. At one point, Paul sympathetically acknowledged that the police were overwhelmed and not enough of them had been assigned to the parade, but she soon changed her stance in order to maximize publicity for her cause.Adams and Keene (2008). p. 92. The police did actually arrest some spectators and fine them for crossing over the ropes. Prior to the cavalry's arrival, other people began helping with crowd control. At times the marchers had been forced to go single file in order to move forward. Boy Scouts with batons helped push back spectators. A group of soldiers linked arms to hold people back. Some of the black drivers from the floats also stepped in to help.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 148. The Massachusetts and the Pennsylvania national guards stepped in, too. Eventually, boys from the Maryland Agricultural College created a human barrier protecting the women from the angry crowd and helping them progress forward to their destination.Flexner (1959). p. 273.  Rally at Continental Hall  The final act was a meeting at the Memorial Continental Hall (later part of the expanded DAR Constitution Hall). Speakers were Anna Howard Shaw, Carrie Chapman Catt, Mary Johnston, and Helen Adams Keller. Shaw, reflecting on the failure of police protection, stated that she was ashamed of the national capital, but she praised the marchers. She also recognized that they could use publicity about police failures to the suffragists' advantage. Blatch had used a similar security failure in New York in 1912 to the suffragists' advantage. Aftermath  Alice Paul's response  Though at first she sympathized with the overwhelmed police force at the parade, Paul quickly capitalized on the verbal abuse the marchers had endured. She blamed the police for colluding with violent opposition to the non-violent demonstration. She asked participants to write affidavits about negative reactions they'd experienced, which Paul used to request Congressional action against Chief Sylvester. She also used these statements to generate press releases in Washington and around the country, garnering additional publicity for the suffrage procession. The resulting publicity also brought in additional donations that helped Paul cover the event's cost of $13,750.Lunardini (1986). p. 31. Paul's publicity campaign stressed that the marchers had demonstrated bravery and non-violent resistance to the hostile crowd. Several of the suffragists pointed out in the media that a government that couldn't protect its female citizens could not properly represent them. Paul's deft handling of the situation made woman's suffrage one of the most-discussed subjects in America.Adams and Keene (2008). pp. 95‚Äì96. Paul also orchestrated a meeting, primarily of political men who were suffrage supporters, at the Columbia Theater. The purpose was to add pressure on Congress to hold hearings about police misconduct. Key participants included activist attorney Louis Brandeis (who became a Supreme Court justice in 1916) and Minnesota senator Moses Edwin Clapp. She kept her role in organizing the event out of the spotlight.  Congressional response  March 8, 1913 front page of 220pxThe Senate Committee on the District of Columbia quickly organized a subcommittee hearing to determine why the crowds at the parade had gotten out of hand. They listened to testimony and read numerous affidavits. Hearings were held March 6‚Äì13, and April 16‚Äì17. Sylvester defended his own actions and blamed individual policemen for disobeying his orders. In the end, Sylvester was exonerated, but public opinion about him was unfavorable. When he was finally forced to resign in 1915 due to an unrelated incident, the mishandling of the 1913 parade was seen as instrumental in his ouster.Adams and Keene (2008). pp. 96‚Äì97.  President Wilson  Alice Paul and the Congressional Union asked President Wilson to push Congress for a federal amendment, beginning with a deputation to the White House shortly after the parade and in several additional visits. He responded initially by saying he had never considered the matter, though he told a Colorado delegation in 1911 that he was indeed pondering the subject. Though he assured the women he would consider it, he did not act on the issue; eventually he flatly remarked there was no room for suffrage on his agenda.Stevens (1920). pp. 22‚Äì23. The deputation wished for Wilson to press his party to support suffrage legislation. He asserted that he had no influence over his party's actions in Congress, but for issues he considered important, he did use his leverage in a partisan manner, such as with repealing the Panama Canal tolls act.Stevens (1920). pp. 29‚Äì30. When asked if it had been unwise for her to push Wilson for his stance on woman's suffrage, Paul responded that it was important to make the public aware of his position so they could use it against him when the time came to put pressure on the Democrats during an election.Stevens (1920). p. 15. It took until 1918 for Wilson to finally change his stance on the suffrage amendment.Wheeler, ed. (1995). p. 18.Lunardini (1986). p. xiii.  Impacts on the suffrage movement  Paul inaugurated her leadership in the American suffrage movement with the 1913 procession. This event revived the push for a federal woman's suffrage amendment, a cause that the NAWSA had allowed to languish.Zahniser and Fry (2014). p. 126. Little more than a month after the parade, the Susan B. Anthony amendment was re-introduced in both houses of Congress.Stevens (1920). p. 23. For the first time in decades it was debated on the floor.Stevens (1920). p. 24. The demonstration on Pennsylvania Avenue was the precursor to Paul's other high-profile events that, along with actions by the NAWSA, culminated in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution in 1919 and its ratification in 1920. Paul's focus on a federal amendment contrasted sharply with the NAWSA's state-by-state approach to suffrage, leading to a rift between the Constitutional Committee and the national board. The committee disassociated from the NAWSA and became the Congressional Union.Dodd (2008). pp. 377‚Äì379. The Congressional Union eventually became subsumed by the National Woman's Party, also led by Paul, in 1916.Adams (1967). pp. 131‚Äì132. Miscellaneous  In film  The Woman Suffrage Procession was featured in the 2004 film Iron Jawed Angels, which chronicles the strategies of Alice Paul, Lucy Burns, and the National Woman's Party as they lobby and demonstrate for the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would assure voting rights for all American women.  United States currency  On April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced plans for the back of the new $10 note to feature an image of the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession that passed the steps of the Treasury Department where the allegorical tableaux took place. It is planned also to honor many of the leaders of the suffrage movement, including Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Alice Paul. The front of the new $10 note is to retain the portrait of Alexander Hamilton. Designs for new $5, $10 and $20 bills were to be unveiled in 2020. Later, it was said that the new note would not be ready for circulation until 2026.

Symons argues that the female orgasm is not an adaptive trait and that women have the capacity for it only because orgasm is adaptive for men, and that differences between the sexual behavior of male and female homosexuals help to show underlying differences between male and female sexuality. In his view, homosexual men tend to be sexually promiscuous because of the tendency of men in general to desire sex with a large number of partners, a tendency that in heterosexual men is usually restrained by women's typical lack of interest in promiscuous sex. Symons also argues that rape can be explained in evolutionary terms and feminist claims that it is not sexually motivated are incorrect. The book received several positive reviews, as well as some criticism: it was described as the most important work on human sociobiology to date, but also dismissed as an impoverished work. It has been seen as a classic work on human sexual evolution and used as a textbook, though critics have questioned Symons's explanation of the female orgasm and his suggestion that eliminating rape \\"might well entail a cure worse than the disease\\". The work influenced the biologist Randy Thornhill and the anthropologist Craig T. Palmer's A Natural History of Rape (2000). Symons's arguments about homosexuality have received both criticism and support from commentators, and he has been both accused of supporting genetic determinism and defended against the charge. Summary Symons argues that women and men have different sexual natures, apparent in their typical \\"sexual behaviors, attitudes, and feelings\\", but partially concealed by moral injunctions and the compromises inherent in relations between the sexes. He attributes these differences to human evolutionary history, writing that during its hunting and gathering phase, the sexual desires and dispositions that were adaptive for men obstructed reproduction for women, while those that were adaptive for women obstructed reproduction for men. He writes that his discussion of sex differences in sexuality is not intended to affect social policy. He discusses evolutionary concepts and the difficulties involved in applying them to humans, the capacity for orgasm, the loss of human estrus, sexual selection and its components intrasexual competition and sexual choice, the desire for sexual variety, and the development of human ovulation. He argues that among all peoples, sex is typically understood to be a service that females render to males. In the introduction, Symons argues that modern understandings of \\"natural selection\\" and \\"fitness\\" are value free, the latter term measuring reproductive success rather than referring to human value judgments, that is necessary to distinguish between proximate and ultimate explanations of animal behavior, the former being concerned with how animals come to develop behavior patterns, and the latter with why they develop these patterns, that while a feature of structure or behavior may benefit an animal, only features that result from natural selection should be considered functions, that the persistence of the nature-nurture controversy is partly the result of failing to distinguish between proximate and ultimate causation, that learning abilities are more often concerned with specific problems than they are the expression of general capacities, and that the secondary sex differences that exist in animals of most species are the consequences the different reproductive behaviors of males and females. According to Symons, while orgasm in the human female has been proposed to be an adaptation resulting from selective forces, the available evidence, which shows that the female orgasm is far from being a universal result of heterosexual intercourse and that its frequency varies greatly between cultures and between individuals, does not support that conclusion. Symons suggested that the female orgasm may be possible for female mammals because it is adaptive for males. He notes that in most mammalian species the only known function of the clitoris is to generate sensation during copulation, but saw no evidence that \\"the female genitals of any mammalian species have been designed by natural selection for efficiency in orgasm production.\\" He criticizes Elizabeth Sherfey's view that the female orgasm is an adaptation, writing that her arguments are not supported by ethnographic or biological evidence. Symons proposes that male human ancestors lost the ability to detect ovulation in females by smell because females gained a reproductive advantage by concealing ovulation, and that estrus ceased to exist in humans at the same time. Observing that estrous female chimpanzees are more successful than nonestrous females in obtaining meat from males, Symons suggests that when hunting became a dominant male economic activity during human evolution, the benefits to females of receiving meat may have outweighed the costs to them of constant sexual activity, leading to women making sexual overtures to men in order to obtain meat. In his discussion of \\"the desire for sexual variety\\", Symons reviews literature on the \\"Coolidge effect\\", the \\"phenomenon of male rearousal by a new female\\". Discussing rape, Symons suggests that because males can \\"potentially sire offspring at almost no cost ... selection favors male attempts to copulate with fertile females whenever this potential can be realized.\\" He criticizes the feminist Susan Brownmiller's argument in Against Our Will (1975) that rape is not sexually motivated, writing that she inadequately documents her thesis and that all of the reasons that she and other authors have given for concluding that rapists are not motivated by sexual desire are open to criticism. Symons writes that Brownmiller's claim that the function of rape is to keep all women in a state of fear has been \\"vigorously contested\\", and that it is also an example of a na√Øve form of functionalism, which is unacceptable since no process that might generate such \\"functions\\" has been shown to exist. Symons argues that socialization towards a \\"more humane sexuality\\" requires the inhibition of impulses that are part of human nature because they have proved adaptive over millions of years, and concluded that while under the right rearing conditions, \\"males could be produced who would want only the kinds of sexual interactions that women want\\" this \\"might well entail a cure worse than the disease.\\" He considers the major contribution of feminist investigations of rape to be to document the perspective of its victims, showing, for example, that they do not want to be raped. Symons considers two different kinds of evidence especially important in supporting his claim that there are typical differences between the sexual desires and dispositions of men and women: hormone studies and the behavior of male and female homosexuals. Because homosexuals do not have to \\"compromise sexually with members of the opposite sex\\" their sex lives \\"should provide dramatic insight into male sexuality and female sexuality in their undiluted states.\\" According to Symons, fundamental differences between men and women are apparent from the fact that, while there is a substantial industry producing pornography for male homosexuals, no pornography is produced for lesbians, and that lesbians, as compared to male homosexuals, have much greater interest in forming stable and monogamous relationships and having sex with loving partners. He argues that the similarities between heterosexual and lesbian relationships, and the differences between both and the relations of male homosexuals, show that \\"the sexual proclivities of homosexual males are very rarely manifested in behavior.\\" He proposes that heterosexual men would be as promiscuous as homosexual men tend to be if most women were interested in engaging in promiscuous heterosexual sex, and that it is women's lack of interest that prevents this. He considers, but rejects, alternative explanations for the differences between male homosexual and lesbian behavior, such as the effects of socialization, finding them unsupported. He concludes that while the \\"existence of large numbers of exclusive homosexuals in contemporary Western societies attests to the importance of social experience in determining the objects that humans sexually desire\\", the fact that male homosexual behavior in some ways resembles an exaggerated version of male heterosexual behavior, and lesbian behavior in some ways resembles an exaggerated version of female heterosexual behavior, indicates that other aspects of human sexuality are not affected by social influences to the same extent. Background and publication history According to Symons, the ideas that he developed in The Evolution of Human Sexuality were partly inspired by a conversation he had with the ethologist Richard Dawkins in 1968. Symons, who had concluded that \\"men tend to want a variety of sexual partners and women tend not to because this desire always was adaptive for ancestral males and never was adaptive for ancestral females\\", found that Dawkins had independently reached the same conclusion. Symons presented an early draft of the book during a 1974 seminar on primate and human sexuality he co-taught with the anthropologist Donald Brown. Symons argued in the draft that there are universal human sex differences. Brown assisted Symons in writing the book. The book was first published in hardcover by Oxford University Press in 1979. A paperback edition followed in 1981. Reception Mainstream media The Evolution of Human Sexuality received a negative review from the anthropologist Clifford Geertz in The New York Review of Books. Subsequent discussions include those by the anthropologist Craig Stanford in American Scientist and the evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber in Psychology Today. Geertz wrote that \\"virtually none\\" of Symons's claims are based on research Symons conducted himself, and that Symons \\"made no direct inquiries into human sexuality\\", instead basing himself on anthropological reports and other material, resulting in a book that is \\"a pastiche more than a study\\". He accused Symons of supporting his views through selective use of evidence, such as an \\"extremely brief and fragmentary\\" review of the effects of hormones on human sexuality. He considered Symons's characterizations of male and female homosexuals to be on the level of national or ethnic stereotypes, and found it questionable whether Symons's observations support his claims about differences between male and female sexuality. He questioned whether Symons was correct to believe it possible to determine what natures and dispositions men and women have prior to the influence of human culture, and criticized Symons for viewing human sexuality as a biological fact with cultural implications rather than a cultural activity sustaining a biological process. He disagreed with the favorable views of The Evolution of Human Sexuality expressed by the biologists E. O. Wilson and George C. Williams, and the then president of the American Anthropological Association, calling the work impoverished. He wrote that if the book was the most important work on human sociobiology to date, this was unfortunate. Stanford described the book as \\"an early think piece rather than a thorough review of actual behavior.\\" He noted that the biologist Randy Thornhill and the anthropologist Craig T. Palmer cited The Evolution of Human Sexuality extensively in their work A Natural History of Rape (2000), but criticized them for relying on Symons as an \\"authority on human mating\\". Barber, writing in 2011, described The Evolution of Human Sexuality as the \\"classic rejoinder\\" to Brownmiller's argument that rape is not sexually motivated, and credited Symons with a \\"resounding defeat of Brownmiller\\". However, he wrote that since it was published, date rape has emerged as the most common type of sexual assault and that \\"College men do not fit the profile of rapists drawn by Symons because they have high social status rather than being underprivileged.\\" Scientific and academic journals, 1979‚Äì2000 The Evolution of Human Sexuality received positive reviews from the anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy in The Quarterly Review of Biology and the psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson in The Sciences, a mixed review from Elmer S. Miller in Social Science Quarterly, and a negative review from the anthropologist Judith Shapiro in Science. Subsequent discussions include those by Lisa Sanchez in Gender Issues. Hrdy credited Symons with being one of the first to apply evolutionary theory to human sexuality and described The Evolution of Human Sexuality as \\"an insightful, theoretically sophisticated, and delightfully literate examination of the sexual emotions of men and women\\" and \\"the best available study of human sexual emotions.\\" She predicted that many social scientists, but few zoologists, would disagree with Symons's conclusion that there are innate psychological differences between men and women. She found Symons's review of biological literature on the \\"Coolidge effect\\", and the sociobiological literature on adultery, valuable, and although she found his \\"extrapolating from the Coolidge effect to human philandering\\" open to question, considered his discussion of the relationship between nature and culture more sophisticated than that of most sociobiologists. She credited Symons with usefully drawing on both traditional anthropology and sociobiology. She found his treatment of female sexuality both more original and more controversial than his treatment of male sexuality, and argued against his view that many aspects of female sexuality, such as the female orgasm, were only accidental by-products of evolution. Daly and Wilson wrote that Symons brought an \\"even-handed, critical intelligence\\" to the discussion of the evolutionary basis of sex differences, and that he was willing to criticize the writings of sociobiologists where appropriate. However, they found Symons's discussion of the evolution of concealment of ovulation in humans less useful than that of several other authors, including Hrdy, and concluded that Symons was not fully successful in establishing criteria to determine whether a given feature of an animal is an adaptation. They observed that though \\"seemingly bizarre\\", Symons's argument that the sexual behavior of homosexuals helps to test hypotheses about sex differences in sexuality is logical. Miller described The Evolution of Human Sexuality as well-written and fascinating, but argued that Symons, with his focus on reproductive success, did not fully answer questions about \\"the relevance of nonhuman animal studies for an understanding of human social life.\\" He pointed to infanticide as an example of a phenomenon that was difficult to explain in terms of reproductive success arguments, especially since \\"killing is generally performed by the mother.\\" He also argued that \\"the epistemological foundation of research that assigns culture the status of epiphenomena\\" was open to debate, and that Symons limited the value of his contributions by ignoring the \\"question of cultural significance\\". Shapiro considered Symons's thesis about human sexuality unprovable, and argued that by outlining the relevant theoretical and methodological issues carefully and clearly he showed the difficulties to be greater than he realized. She maintained that his conclusions were only acceptable if one already agreed with sociobiology. She wrote that he attached too much importance to the idea that reproductive strategies explain relations between men and women, thereby connecting human sexuality too closely to reproduction, and accused him of showing no awareness of \\"the many meanings that sex can take on in different cultural settings.\\" She criticized his views on subjects such as the motivations for rape, marriage, and the female orgasm, and also faulted the quality of his \\"cross- cultural data on erotic activity.\\" She described his argument that \\"the innate sexual tendencies of men and women are mostly truly expressed in the behavior of homosexuals\\" as \\"ingenious\\". She also maintained that his work was unlikely to appeal to social scientists. Sanchez noted that Symons's view that rape is not an adaptation has been questioned by Thornhill and Palmer. However, she considered Symons correct to caution that the available data are insufficient to support the conclusion that rape is an adaptation. Scientific and academic journals, 2001‚Äìpresent The socialist feminist Lynne Segal argued in Psychology, Evolution & Gender that Symons mistakenly believed that women, by being \\"continuously copulable\\", cause men to desire to engage in promiscuous sexual relations with them. She saw Symons's endorsement of the \\"genetic determinism\\" of the biologist Randy Thornhill and the anthropologist Craig T. Palmer's A Natural History of Rape (2000) as following from the views he expressed in The Evolution of Human Sexuality. Palmer and Thornhill noted in the Journal of Sex Research that while Symons stated that did not \\"believe that available data are even close to sufficient to warrant the conclusion\\" that rape is a \\"facultative adaptation in the human male\\" and therefore concluded instead that rape is \\"a by-product of various different sexual adaptations in men and women\\", he failed to specify exactly how the available data were insufficient to support the conclusion that rape is a facultative adaptation or what kind of data might potentially demonstrate that rape is a facultative adaptation. They added that given Symons's failure to explain the shortcomings of the available data or explain how it could be improved upon, it was understandable that the question of whether rape is an adaptation was more thoroughly investigated by other researchers, including Thornhill himself. Jocelyn Bosley described The Evolution of Human Sexuality as an influential work in Signs. However, she criticized Symons for accepting at face value the idea that men are \\"more motivated than women to seek sex.\\" Bosley wrote that Symons argued that female orgasm is a byproduct of the existence of the male orgasm through an \\"infamous and widely cited\\" comparison of the female orgasm to male nipples. She questioned the idea that Symons's willingness to separate \\"female orgasm from female reproductive fitness\\" has feminist implications, writing that while Symons \\"lent scientific support to some feminists' claims for a primordial similarity between male and female sexuality\\", other feminists found his account of female orgasm \\"socially and politically regrettable\\". She concluded that Symons \\"thoroughly undercut the position of feminists who maintained that true sexual equality would be achieved only when peculiarly female sexual experiences were recognized and galvanized as the basis for a new, egalitarian sexuality.\\" David Puts, Khytam Dawood, and Lisa Welling argued in the Archives of Sexual Behavior that while Symons's proposal that the human female orgasm is a non-functional byproduct of orgasm in men is plausible, it is a hypothesis that \\"currently lacks empirical support\\", that there is some counter evidence, and that the issue remains unresolved. Dean Lee argued in Biology and Philosophy that Symons's account of the female orgasm has been misinterpreted in the scholarly literature. According to Lee, while Symons's case that the female orgasm is not an adaptation attracted controversy, little attention was given to the alternative explanation of the female orgasm Symons provided. He described this alternative explanation as \\"obscure, complicated, and frankly speculative\\". He maintained that Symons did not, as has been assumed, offer the same explanation of the female orgasm as that later put forward by the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, according to which the female orgasm is possible because of the clitoris, which is a byproduct of the embryological connection with the male penis. He identified Symons's alternative argument as being contained in the sentence in which Symons wrote that, \\"The female orgasm may be a byproduct of mammalian bisexual potential: orgasm may be possible for female mammals because it is adaptive for males.\\" He interpreted Symons as maintaining that orgasm is a typically male trait based on a mechanism in the brain that exists in individuals of both sexes: a woman who experiences an orgasm during heterosexual intercourse is exhibiting bisexual behavior because her mating response to a male is female behavior and her orgasm is a male behavior. He questioned whether Symons actually intended to make an analogy between the existence of the female orgasm and that of the male nipple, writing that Symons's comments on the issue had been taken out of context. Other evaluations, 1979‚Äì1992 Brian Easlea argued against Symons that desire for anonymous sex is actually typical only of sexist men and is not characteristic of men in general. He rejected Symons's view that socializing men to \\"want only the kinds of sexual interactions that women want...might well entail a cure worse than the disease\\". The feminist Susan Griffin considered Symons's view that the female orgasm is only a byproduct of selection for the male orgasm an example of the ideology of the \\"pornographic mind\\", which conceives of female sexuality as \\"an empty space which craves male presence, and which cannot exist without the male\\". Hrdy argued that for Symons, \\"women have sexual feelings for much the same reason that men have nipples: nature makes the two sexes as variations on the same basic model\\", a view of female sexuality she considered reminiscent of Aristotle and 19th century Victorianism. The biologists Richard Lewontin and Steven Rose, writing with the psychologist Leon Kamin, observed that, like some other sociobiologists, Symons maintains that \\"the manifest trait is not itself coded by genes, but that a potential is coded and the trait only arises when the appropriate environmental cue is given.\\" In their view, \\"Despite its superficial appearance of dependence on environment, this model is completely genetically determined, independent of the environment.\\" They concluded that Symons's arguments provide examples \\"of how sociobiological theory can explain anything, no matter how contradictory, by a little mental gymnastics\\". The biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling observed that while Symons believes that rape should be eliminated, he also states that the rearing conditions needed to eliminate rape \\"might well entail a cure worse than the disease.\\" She criticized his position. Daniel Rancour-Laferriere described The Evolution of Human Sexuality as an \\"important treatise\\". However, he argued that the evidence Symons cites about animal behavior actually suggests that the female orgasm is adaptive. The sociologist Jeffrey Weeks criticized Symons's view that differences between male and female sexual attitudes have a biological basis, arguing that it was not supported by Symons's evidence. The gay rights activist Dennis Altman argued that Symons wrongly maintained that gay men, due to their nature as men, are incapable of monogamy. The philosopher Michael Ruse concluded that while Symons's explanation of male homosexual promiscuity could be correct, it depends on controversial and disputable claims. The ethologist Iren√§us Eibl-Eibesfeldt questioned Symons's argument that the absence of visible female estrus developed so that women could \\"offer themselves to men\\" for rewards of food. He noted that prey is shared in chimpanzees without sexual rewards. He rejected Symons's argument that the infrequency of the female orgasm shows that it has no function. The ecologist Jared Diamond called The Evolution of Human Sexuality \\"outstanding\\". The economist Richard Posner called the work the \\"best single book on the sociobiology of sex\\". The anthropologist Helen Fisher criticized Symons's view that \\"homosexual behavior illustrates essential truths about male and female sexual natures\\". The psychologists Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom wrote that Symons's observation that \\"tribal chiefs are often both gifted orators and highly polygynous\\" helps to show \\"how linguistic skills could make a Darwinian difference.\\" Other evaluations, 1993‚Äì2004 The journalist Matt Ridley argued that Symons's ideas about the evolution of gender differences had revolutionary implications, since \\"the overwhelming majority of the research that social scientists had done on human sexuality was infused with the assumption that there are no mental differences\\" between the sexes. He endorsed Symons's explanation of male homosexual promiscuity. The psychologist David Buss called The Evolution of Human Sexuality \\"the most important treatise on the evolution of human sexuality in the twentieth century\\" and a \\"classic treatise\\". The journalist Robert Wright called the book \\"the first comprehensive anthropological survey of human sexual behavior from the new Darwinian perspective\\". He credited Symons with showing that the tendency for men to be more interested than women in having sex with multiple sexual partners holds good across many cultures and is not restricted to western society. The philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone observed that while The Evolution of Human Sexuality is \\"used as a textbook and is considered a major formulation of human sexuality\\", she sees as the work \\"a paradigm of the prevailing Western biological view\\" of female sexuality, a view she considers \\"essentially male\\". The critic Joseph Carroll described the book as a \\"standard work\\" on its subject. However, he criticized Symons's arguments about homosexuality. The sociologist Tim Megarry dismissed The Evolution of Human Sexuality as, \\"a projection of American dating culture onto prehistory\\". The anthropologist Meredith Small argued that the work of sex researchers Masters and Johnson, which shows that the female clitoris is made of the same tissue as the penis and responds sexually in a similar manner, suggests that the clitoris results from an embryonic connection with the male penis and supports Symons's view that it is not an adaptation. Williams called The Evolution of Human Sexuality one of the classic works on \\"the biology of human sexual attitudes\\", alongside the work of Hrdy. Alan F. Dixson described Symons's explanation of male homosexual promiscuity as \\"interesting\\". The biologist Paul R. Ehrlich described The Evolution of Human Sexuality as a \\"classic but controversial treatise on human sexual evolution\\". He identified Symons's study of the development of human ovulation as a landmark. Thornhill and Palmer identified Symons as the first author to propose that rape is by- product of evolutionary adaptations. They observed that Symons has falsely been accused of basing his arguments on the assumption that behavior is genetically determined, even though he explicitly rejects that assumption and criticizes it at length. They endorsed his explanation of male homosexual promiscuity, and his arguments against the idea that rape is not sexually motivated. Gould commented that the argument that the clitoris is not adaptive, put forward by Symons and subsequently by Gould himself, has been widely misunderstood as a denial of the adaptive value of the female orgasm in general, or even as a claim that female orgasms lack significance. The anthropologist Melvin Konner called The Evolution of Human Sexuality \\"the classic introduction to the evolutionary dimensions\\" of sex. Pinker called The Evolution of Human Sexuality \\"groundbreaking\\". He criticized what he considered personal abuse of Symons by Lewontin et al. in their discussion of the book. Other evaluations, 2005‚Äìpresent Buss called The Evolution of Human Sexuality the first \\"watershed in the study of human mating strategies\\" to follow evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers' 1972 paper \\"Parental Investment and Sexual Selection\\" and a \\"trenchant classic\\". He credited Symons with being \\"the first to articulate the theoretical foundations of a fully adaptationist view of male and female mating minds\\" and \\"the first social scientist to take the writings of George C. Williams ... to heart, applying rigorous standards for invoking the critical but challenging concept adaptation.\\" He described The Evolution of Human Sexuality as \\"the first major treatise on evolutionary psychology proper, highlighting the centrality of psychological mechanisms as adaptations and using human sexuality as a detailed vehicle for this more general argument.\\" Elizabeth Lloyd concluded that Symons proposes \\"the best available explanation for the evolution of the female orgasm\\", stating that while Symons's conclusions are not beyond dispute, and have been criticized on a number of different grounds, they are consistent with existing evidence, and help to explain \\"otherwise mysterious findings.\\" Thornhill and Steven W. Gangestad described The Evolution of Human Sexuality as \\"a landmark in the study of human sexuality\\" and \\"the first serious effort to investigate and inquire into the nature of human sexuality\\". They added that many of Symons's ideas have received support, including his view that women's sexuality includes \\"sexual adaptation that functions to gain access to nongenetic material benefits from males through its expression when women are not fertile within their menstrual cycles.\\" The anthropologists Anne Bolin and Patricia Whelehan identified as Symons one of two major participants in the debate over the reproductive role of the female orgasm, the other being Sherfey. They wrote that Symons's view of female sexuality \\"reflects western concepts of the passive female and overlooks the evidence of actual female sexual functioning, such as the capacity for multiple orgasms in women.\\" They considered the female orgasm more likely to be \\"an extension of the pleasurable sensations associated with coitus in primate females generally\\" than a by-product of the male orgasm, as proposed by Symons. They observed that while Lloyd endorsed Symons's view, her work has been \\"severely criticized\\" by the psychologist David P. Barash, and the relationship between female orgasm and reproduction remains a topic of ongoing debate. Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth√° called The Evolution of Human Sexuality a \\"classic\\". However, they also accused Symons of having a \\"bleak\\" vision of human sexuality. The anthropologist Peter B. Gray and Justin R. Garcia maintained that demographic data supports an evolutionary account of human mating psychology similar to that proposed by Symons.

He was a member of the First AIF, and was killed in action during the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, in Ottoman Turkey on 25 April 1915.Despite various suggestions given over time, related to particular individuals, it is clear that, because, at least, six former VFL footballers were killed during the chaos of the landing at Anzac Cove ‚Äî Rupert Balfe (University, Alan Cordner (Geelong and Collingwood), Claud Crowl (Geelong), Charlie Fincher (South Melbourne), Fen McDonald (Carlton and Melbourne), and Joe Pearce (Melbourne) ‚Äî it can never be definitively argued that one of these men was \\"the first VFL footballer killed in the First World War\\". Family The son of Richard Terrell Crowl (1851‚Äì1923) and Jane Crowl (1851‚Äì1918), n√©e Brown, he was born at Stratford, Victoria on 26 December 1892. He was the cousin of the Geelong footballer Captain Joseph Terrell Crowl who was killed in action at Gallipoli on 27 June 1915. Athlete He attended Caulfield Grammar School from 1903 to 1905;Main and Allen (2002), p.48. and, whilst there, he was an outstanding performer in under-age athletics.Main and Allen (2002), pp.47-48; Wilkinson (1997), pp.34-35. At the 1905 Caulfield Grammar School Sports, held on 27 October, he was declared the under-14 champion, having won the 100 yards and 220 yards, and come second in the 440 yards. He was awarded the \\"Under 14 Cup\\" having beaten another student, equal on points, in a \\"run off\\".Schools Sports, The Argus, (Tuesday, 31 October 1905), p.7. Running for the school, he came third in the under-14 100 yards race in the Fourth Annual Victorian School Athletic Championships two weeks later.Schools Championship Sports, The Age, (Saturday 11 November 1905), p.14; School Championship Sports, The Argus, (Saturday 11 November 1905), p.17; note: in both reports, his family name is mistakenly given as \\"Crowe\\" (there was no student named Crowe at CGS at that time). Footballer Although he had been training with Carlton, he played his first senior game for St Kilda, aged 18, against Carlton, at Princes Park on Saturday, 29 July 1911 (round fifteen). He was one of nine men who took the field for St Kilda for the first time on that day. The nine were Alby Bowtell, Roy Cazaly, Crowl, Peter Donnelly, Alf Hammond, Otto Opelt, Rowley Smith, Tom Soutar, and Bill Ward ‚Äî and, including that match, and ignoring Harrie Hattam (16 games), Bert Pierce (41 games), and Bill Woodcock (65 games), the very inexperienced team's remaining fifteen players had only played a total of 46 matches. They were required because many of the regular St Kilda First XVIII players were on strike. The fact that Crowl played the last of his three senior games in round seventeen, is simply explained: the strike was resolved before round eighteen, and the only player of the nine to keep his place was Cazaly. Crowl played well in his first match in the back pocket of a team that was thrashed by 114 points, 18.21 (129) to 2.3 (15).St. Kilda's New Team: Gardiner Scores 10 Goals, \\"The Argus\\", (Monday 31 July 1911), p.5. He played the next match, against Essendon, also in the back pocket; St Kilda lost by 125 points, 24.19 (163) to 5.8 (38).Essendon's Victory, The Argus, (Monday, 21 August 1911), p.4. In the last of his three senior matches, in round seventeen, against Richmond, he played at centre half-forward. It is not clear whether the selectors thought that his presence would strengthen the forward line, or that his absence would make the back-line less vulnerable; regardless, Richmond won by 87 points, 17.21 (123) to 5.6 (36).Demoralised St. Kilda, The Argus, (Monday, 28 August 1911), p.4. Soldier He enlisted in the First AIF on 25 August 1914, giving his occupation as a farmer at Poowong, Victoria.

Fen McDonald who had played his first game for Carlton on the same day that Crowl made his debut for St Kilda, also died in action at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. A special medal named in honour of both men was awarded to the best player on the ground in the match played between St Kilda and Carlton on the hundredth anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.

Some effects are harmful; others welcome. Many depend on circumstances. A major component of concrete is cement, which has its own environmental and social impacts and contributes largely to those of concrete. The cement industry is one of the main producers of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Concrete causes damage to the most fertile layer of the earth, the topsoil. Concrete is used to create hard surfaces which contribute to surface runoff that may cause soil erosion, water pollution and flooding. Conversely, concrete is one of the most powerful tools for proper flood control, by means of damming, diversion, and deflection of flood waters, mud flows, and the like. Light-colored concrete can reduce the urban heat island effect, due to its higher albedo. However, original vegetation results in even greater benefit. Concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution. The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns due to toxicity and (usually naturally occurring) radioactivity. Wet concrete is highly alkaline and should always be handled with proper protective equipment. Concrete recycling is increasing in response to improved environmental awareness, legislation, and economic considerations. Conversely, the use of concrete mitigates the use of alternative building materials such as wood, which is a natural form of carbon sequestering. Concrete structures also last much longer than wood structures. Carbon dioxide emissions and climate change The cement industry is one of the two largest producers of carbon dioxide (CO2), creating up to 8% of worldwide man- made emissions of this gas, of which 50% is from the chemical process and 40% from burning fuel. The Cement Sustainability Initiative: Our agenda for action, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, page 20, published 1 June 2002 https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2018-06-13-making- concrete-change-cement-lehne-preston.pdf The produced for the manufacture of structural concrete (using ~14% cement) is estimated at 410 kg/m3 (~180 kg/tonne @ density of 2.3 g/cm3) (reduced to 290 kg/m3 with 30% fly ash replacement of cement). The CO2 emission from the concrete production is directly proportional to the cement content used in the concrete mix; 900 kg of CO2 are emitted for the fabrication of every ton of cement, accounting for 88% of the emissions associated with the average concrete mix. Nisbet, M., Marceau, M., VanGeem, M. (2002). Environmental Life Cycle Inventory of Portland Cement Concrete. http://www.nrmca.org/taskforce/item_2_talkingpoints/sustainability/sustainability/sn2137a.pdf Cement manufacture contributes greenhouse gases both directly through the production of carbon dioxide when calcium carbonate is thermally decomposed, producing lime and carbon dioxide,EIA ‚Äì Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the U.S. 2006-Carbon Dioxide Emissions and also through the use of energy, particularly from the combustion of fossil fuels. One area of the concrete life cycle worth noting is the fact that concrete has a very low embodied energy per unit mass. This is primarily the result of the fact that the materials used in concrete construction, such as aggregates, pozzolans, and water, are relatively plentiful and can often be drawn from local sources.Building Green. (1993). Cement and Concrete: Environmental Considerations. Retrieved 2 November 2015.http://www.wbcsdcement.org/pdf/tf2/cementconc.pdf This means that transportation only accounts for 7% of the embodied energy of concrete, while the cement production accounts for 70%. With a total embodied energy of 1.69 GJ/tonne concrete is has lower embodied energy per unit mass than most common building material besides wood. However, concrete structures have high mass, so this comparison is not always directly relevant to decision making. It is worth noting that this value is based on mix proportions for concrete of no more than 20% fly ash. It is estimated that one percent replacement of cement with fly ash represents a .7% reduction in energy consumption. With some proposed mixes containing as much as 80% fly ash, this would represent a considerable energy savings. Design improvements There is a growing interest in reducing carbon emissions related to concrete from both the academic and industrial sectors, especially with the possibility of future carbon tax implementation. Several approaches to reducing emissions have been suggested.  Cement production and use  One reason why the carbon emissions are so high is because cement has to be heated to very high temperatures in order for clinker to form. A major culprit of this is alite (Ca3SiO5), a mineral in concrete that cures within hours of pouring and is therefore responsible for much of its initial strength. However, alite also has to be heated to 1,500 ¬∞C in the clinker-forming process. Some research suggests that alite can be replaced by a different mineral, such as belite (Ca2SiO4). Belite is also a mineral already used in concrete. It has a roasting temperature of 1,200 ¬∞C, which is significantly lower than that of alite. Furthermore, belite is actually stronger once concrete cures. However, belite takes on the order of days or months to set completely, which leaves concrete weak for longer. Current research is focusing on finding possible impurity additives, like magnesium, that might speed up the curing process. It is also worthwhile to consider that belite takes more energy to grind, which may make its full life of impact similar to or even higher than alite. Another approach has been the partial replacement of conventional clinker with such alternatives as fly ash, bottom ash, and slag, all of which are by-products of other industries that would otherwise end up in landfills. Fly ash and bottom ash come from thermoelectric power plants, while slag is a waste from blast furnaces in the ironworks industry. These materials are slowly gaining popularity as additives, especially since they can potentially increase strength, decrease density, and prolong durability of concrete. The main obstacle to wider implementation of fly ash and slag may be largely due to the risk of construction with new technology that has not been exposed to long field testing. Until a carbon tax is implemented, companies are unwilling to take the chance with new concrete mix recipes even if this reduces carbon emissions. However, there are some examples of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù concrete and its implementation. One instance is a concrete company called Ceratech that has started manufacturing concrete with 95% fly ash and 5% liquid additives. Another is the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge, which was constructed with a novel mixture of concrete that included different compositions of Portland cement, fly ash, and slag depending on the portion of the bridge and its material properties requirements. Furthermore, the production of concrete requires large amounts of water, and global production accounts for almost a tenth of worldwide industrial water use. This amounts to 1.7 percent of total global water withdrawal. A study that appeared in Nature Sustainability in 2018 predicts that concrete production will in the future increase pressure on water resources in regions susceptible to drought conditions: \\"In 2050, 75% of the water demand for concrete production will likely occur in regions that are expected to experience water stress.\\"  Carbon Concrete  Carbonatation in concrete is the formation of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) by chemical reaction . The Speed of carbonation depends primarily on the porosity of the concrete and the moisture content. Carbonation in concrete pores happens only at a Relative Humidity (RH) of 40-90%, when RH is higher than 90% carbon dioxide cannot enter the concrete pores, and also when RH is lower than 40% cannot be dissolved in water Pore structures in fresh concrete and air entrained concrete Concrete can be subjected for the most part by two types of carbonation: weathering carbonation and Early age carbonation. Weathering carbonation, occurs in concrete when calcium compounds react with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water H2O in the concrete pores. The reaction is as follows: First, through chemical weathering reacts with water in the concrete pores to form Carbonic acid: :CO2 + H2O <=> H2CO3 carbon dioxide + water ‚Üí carbonic acid Carbonic acid then reacts with calcium carbonate: :Ca(OH)2 \\\\+ H2CO3 ‚Üí CaCO3 \\\\+ 2H2O carbonic acid + calcium carbonate ‚Üí calcium bicarbonate Third Once the calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) has carbonated, the main component of Cement calcium silicate hydrate gel (also shown as C-S-H) can be decalcified, allowing the liberated CaO to carbonate: :H2CO3 \\\\+ CaO ‚Üí CaCO3 \\\\+ H2O Early age carbonation is when we introduce to the early stages of fresh premix concrete or upon initial curing, it can be both natural through exposure or accelerated by augmenting a direct intake of . Gaseous carbon dioxide is converted to solid carbonates and can be permanently stored in concrete for emission reduction, the general reaction of CO2 and calcium silicate hydrate in cement was described in 1974 as: C3S + 3 CO2 + H2O ‚Üí C-S-H + 3CaCO3 + 347 kJ/mol C2S + 2 CO2 + H2O ‚Üí C-S-H + 2CaCO3 + 184 KJ/mol A Canadian company patented and commercialized a novel technology that uses the early age type of carbonation to sequester . This is achieved by directly injecting recycled liquid carbon dioxide from third party industrial emitters, into the concrete wet mix stage during the manufacturing process. Whereby a chemical reaction becomes a mineral, sequestering the greenhouse gas pollutant in concrete infrastructures, buildings, roads, etc for long periods of time. Moreover in a study published in the journal of Cleaner Production authors preformed a model where they proved that improved the compressive strength of the concrete while reducing emissions as a result, in so allowing for a cement loading reduction while at the same time having a \\"4.6% reduction in the carbon footprint\\" Another proposed method of capturing emissions is to absorb CO2 in the curing process, by the use of an admixture (a dicalcium silicate y phase) as the concrete cures. The use of coal ash or another suitable substitute, could theoretically have CO2 emissions below 0 kg/m3, compared to portland cement concrete at 400 kg/m3. The most effective method of production of this concrete would use the exhaust gas of a power plant, where an isolated chamber could control temperature and humidity. In August 2019, reduced CO2 cement was announced which \\"reduces the overall carbon footprint in precast concrete by 70%.\\". The base of these cement being primarily of wollastonite (CaSiO3) and rankinite (3CaO¬∑2SiO2) in contrast to traditional portland cement alite (3CaO¬∑SiO2) belite (2 CaO ¬∑ SiO2). The patented process of concrete making begins with the bonding of particles through liquid phase sintering also referred to as hydrothermal liquid phase densification (rHLPD). A solution mixed of and penetrates the particles, in reaction with ambient conditions to create a bond which creates the reduced-lime, non-hydraulic calcium silicate cement (CSC). Moreover the difference between traditional portland concrete and these carbonated calcium silicate concrete (CSC-C) lies in the final curing process reaction between a water- solution and a family of calcium-silicate: \\"CSC-C curing is a mildly exothermic reaction in which the low-lime calcium silicates in the CSC react with carbon dioxide in the presence of water to produce calcite (CaCO3) and silica () as shown in Reactions II and III. II. CaO.SiO2 + CO2 ‚Üí H2O CaCO3 + SiO2 III: 3CaO.2SiO2 + 3CO2 ‚Üí H2O 3CaCO3 + 2SiO2\\" However as early age carbonation methods have gained recognition due to its substantial carbon sequestration proficiencies, some authors argue the effect of early-age carbonation curing under weathering carbonation for precast concrete \\"Experimental results suggest that early-age carbonated concretes with high w/c ratios (>0.65>0.65) are more likely to be affected by weathering carbonation\\" , and advise this may weaken its strength abilities in the corrosion stages during life service. Italian company Italcementi designed a kind of cement that is supposedly alleviating air pollution by breaking down pollutants that come in contact with the concrete, through the use of titanium dioxide absorbing ultraviolet light. Some environmental experts nevertheless remain skeptical and wonder if the special material can 'eat' enough pollutants to make it financially viable. Jubilee Church in Rome is built from this kind of concrete.The Smog Eating Church of Rome Another aspect to consider in carbon concrete is Surface scaling due to cold climatic conditions and exposure to de-icing salt and freeze-thaw cycle (Frost weathering). Concrete produced by carbonation curing also shows superior performance when subject to physical degradations, e.g., freeze-thaw damage, particularly due to the pore densification effect enabled by the precipitation of carbonation products Some studies link a reduction of CO2 to concrete production, but they are mostly written by authors associated with the proposed solution or the concrete industry . This should give concern that these solutions are Greenwashing. The CO2 emissions from concrete come from the cement in the mixture, methods to reduce the amount of the cement are the only proven methods to reduce the emissions.  Other improvements  There are many other improvements to concrete that do not deal directly with emissions. Recently, much research has gone into ‚Äúsmart‚Äù concretes: concretes that use electrical and mechanical signals to respond to changes in loading conditions. One variety uses carbon fiber reinforcement which provides an electrical response that can be used to measure strain . This allows for monitoring the structural integrity of the concrete without installing sensors.Chen, P.W.; Chung, D.D.L; (1996). Carbon Fiber Reinforced Concrete as an Intrinsically Smart Concrete for Damage Assessment during Static and Dynamic Loading. http://wings.buffalo.edu/academic/department/eng/mae/cmrl/Carbon%20fiber%20reinforced%20concrete%20as%20an%20intrinsically%20smart%20concrete%20for%20damage%20assessment%20during%20static%20and%20dynamic%20loading.pdf The road construction and maintenance industry consumes tonnes of carbon intensive concrete every day to secure road-side and urban infrastructure. As populations grow this infrastructure is becoming increasingly vulnerable to impact from vehicles, creating an ever increasing cycle of damage and waste and ever increasing consumption of concrete for repairs (roadworks are now seen around our cities on almost a daily basis). A major development in the infrastructure industry involves the use of recycled petroleum waste to protect the concrete from damage and enable infrastructure to become dynamic, able to be easily maintained and updated without disturbance to the existing foundations. This simple innovation preserves the foundations for the entire lifespan of a development. Another area of concrete research involves the creation of certain ‚Äúwaterless‚Äù concretes for use in extraplanetary colonization. Most commonly, these concretes use sulfur to act as a non- reactive binder, allowing for construction of concrete structures in environments with no or very little water. These concretes are in many ways indistinguishable from normal hydraulic concrete: they have similar densities, can be used with currently existing metal reinforcement, and they actually gain strength faster than normal concretePRODUCTION OF LUNAR CONCRETE USING MOLTEN SULFUR Final Research Report for JoVe NASA Grant NAG8 - 278 by Dr. Husam A. Omar This application has yet to be explored on Earth, but with concrete production representing as much as two-thirds of the total energy usage of some developing countries, any improvement is worth considering. Surface runoff Surface runoff, when water runs off impervious surfaces, such as non-porous concrete, can cause severe soil erosion and flooding. Urban runoff tends to pick up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, trash and other pollutants from sidewalks, roadways and parking lots.Water Environment Federation, Alexandria, VA; and American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA. \\"Urban Runoff Quality Management.\\" WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. . Chapter 1. Chapter 2. Without attenuation, the impervious cover in a typical urban area limits groundwater percolation and causes five times the amount of runoff generated by a typical woodland of the same size.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. \\"Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff.\\" Document No. EPA 841-F-03-003. February 2003. A 2008 report by the United States National Research Council identified urban runoff as a leading source of water quality problems.United States. National Research Council. Washington, DC. \\"Urban Stormwater Management in the United States.\\" 15 October 2008. pp. 18‚Äì20. In an attempt to counteract the negative effects of impervious concrete, many new paving projects have begun to use pervious concrete, which provides a level of automatic stormwater management. Pervious concrete is created by careful laying of concrete with specifically designed aggregate proportions, which allows for surface runoff to seep through and return to the groundwater. This both prevents flooding and contributes to groundwater replenishment. If designed and layered properly, pervious concrete and other discreetly paved areas can also function as an automatic water filter by preventing certain harmful substances like oils and other chemicals from passing through. Unfortunately there are still downsides to large scale applications of pervious concrete: its reduced strength relative to conventional concrete limits use to low-load areas, and it must be laid properly to reduce susceptibility to freeze-thaw damage and sediment buildup. Urban heat Both concrete and asphalt are the primary contributors to what is known as the urban heat island effect. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 55% of the world‚Äôs population reside in urban areas and 68% of the world‚Äôs population is projected to be urban by 2050; also, \\"the world is projected to add 230 billion m2 (2.5 trillion ft2) of buildings by 2060, or an area equal to the entire current global building stock. This is the equivalent of adding an entire New York City to the planet every 34 days for the next 40 years\\".. As a result, paved surfaces represent a major concern because of the additional energy consumption and air pollution they cause. The potential of energy saving within an area is also high. With lower temperatures, the demand for air conditioning theoretically decreases, saving energy. However, research into the interaction between reflective pavements and buildings has found that, unless the nearby buildings are fitted with reflective glass, solar radiation reflected off pavements can increase building temperatures, increasing air conditioning demands. Moreover, heat transfer from pavements, which cover about one-third of a typical U.S. city , can also influence local temperatures and air quality. Hot surfaces warm the city air through convection, so using materials that absorb less solar energy, such as high-albedo pavements, can reduce the flow of heat into the urban environment and moderate the UHIE . Albedos range from about 0.05 to about 0.35 for currently used pavement material surfaces. Over a typical life service, pavement materials that begin with high albedo tend to lose reflectance, while those with low initial albedo may gain reflectance The Design Trust for Public Space found that by slightly raising the albedo value in New York City, beneficial effects such as energy savings could be achieved., by replacement of black asphalt with light-colored concrete. However, in winter this may be a disadvantage as ice will form more easily and remain longer on light colored surfaces as they will be colder due to less energy absorbed from the reduced amount of sunlight in winter. Another aspect to consider is thermal comfort effect, as well as the need for more mitigation strategies, which don‚Äôt threat the health and wellbeing of pedestrians particularly during heat waves . A study that appeared in Building and Environment in 2019 preformed experiments to project the impact of heat waves and high albedo materials interactions in the northern Italian city of Milan. By calculating the \\"Mediterranean Outdoor Comfort Index\\" (MOCI) in presence of a heat wave, where high albedo materials was used in all surfaces. The study identified a deterioration of the microclimate where high amounts of high albedo materials were located. The use of the high albedo materials was found to \\"lead to the establishment of multiple inter-reflections and a consequent increase in micrometeorological variables such as average radiant temperatures and air temperatures. To be more detailed, these changes lead to an increase in the MOCI that in the afternoon hours can even reach 0.45 units\\". Overall urban configurations should remain of concern when making decisions as people are exposed to weather and thermal confort conditions. The use of high albedo materials within an urban environment can be of positive effect with proper combination of other technologies and strategies such as: vegetation, reflective materials, etc. Urban heat mitigation measures could minimize impacts on microclimate as well as human and wildlife habitats. Concrete dust Building demolition and natural disasters such as earthquakes often release a large amount of concrete dust into the local atmosphere. Concrete dust was concluded to be the major source of dangerous air pollution following the Great Hanshin earthquake. Toxic and radioactive contamination The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns. Natural radioactive elements (K, U, Th, and Rn) can be present in various concentration in concrete dwellings, depending on the source of the raw materials used. For example, some stones naturally emit Radon, and Uranium was once common in mine refuse. Toxic substances may also be unintentionally used as the result of contamination from a nuclear accident. Dust from rubble or broken concrete upon demolition or crumbling may cause serious health concerns depending also on what had been incorporated in the concrete. However, embedding harmful materials in concrete is not always dangerous and may in fact be beneficial. In some cases, incorporating certain compounds such as metals in the hydration process of cement immobilizes them in a harmless state and prevents them from being released freely elsewhere.P.K. Mehta: Concrete technology for sustainable development ‚Äì overview of essential elements, O.E. Gjorv, K. Sakai (Eds.), Concrete technology for a sustainable development in the 21st century, E&FN; Spon, London (2000), pp. 83‚Äì94 Handling precautions Handling of wet concrete must always be done with proper protective equipment. Contact with wet concrete can cause skin chemical burns due to the caustic nature of the mixture of cement and water. Indeed, the pH of fresh cement water is highly alkaline due to the presence of free potassium and sodium hydroxides in solution (pH ~ 13.5). Eyes, hands and feet must be correctly protected to avoid any direct contact with wet concrete and washed without delay if necessary. Concrete recycling Recycled crushed concrete being loaded into a semi-dump truck to be used as granular fill Concrete recycling is an increasingly common method of disposing of concrete structures. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to landfills for disposal, but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness, governmental laws and economic benefits. Concrete, which must be free of trash, wood, paper and other such materials, is collected from demolition sites and put through a crushing machine, often along with asphalt, bricks and rocks. Reinforced concrete contains rebar and other metallic reinforcements, which are removed with magnets and recycled elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may go through the crusher again. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. Aggregate base gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road, with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it. Crushed recycled concrete can sometimes be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants, though the use of recycled concrete limits strength and is not allowed in many jurisdictions. On 3 March 1983, a government-funded research team (the VIRL research.codep) approximated that almost 17% of worldwide landfill was by- products of concrete-based waste.

It involves putting a needle through the skin just above the pubic bone into the bladder. It is typically used as a method to collect urine in child less than 2 years of age who is not yet toilet trained in an effort to diagnose a urinary tract infection.  Indications  In infants or young children with fever, laboratory analysis of the child's urine is needed to diagnose urinary tract infection. Children often are asymptomatic other than fever, or cannot describe the typical symptoms of pain or burning with urination. In children that cannot urinate on command, transurethral bladder catheterization is most often used. However, this method has high rates of sample contamination. Suprapubic aspiration has the lowest rates of contamination, but is often viewed as too invasive by practitioners and parents. In some children, urethral catheterization is not appropriate. In uncircumcised boys with tight phimosis or girls with labial adhesions, suprapubic aspiration is safe, fast, and likely to yield an uncontaminated urine specimen. Since suprapubic aspiration is more invasive than transurethral catheterization, some medical professionals use suprapubic aspiration after a urine sample obtained with transurethral catheterization shows bacterial growth and there is concern for contamination.  Procedure  Male and female bladders, as indicated with arrows. Pathway of suprapubic aspiration is from the anterior abdominal wall (at left of each panel), just above the pubic symphysis. Note that a distended bladder will extend higher into the abdominal wall than the above image shows. Suprapubic aspiration is best performed if the child has not urinated recently, and thus has a full bladder. In infants, this can be ensured by checking that their diaper is dry. In all children, the bladder volume can be measured with ultrasound. In hospitals or clinics without access to ultrasound, the bladder can be palpated or percussed to verify location and estimate volume. The area about 1-2 centimeters above the pubic symphysis is cleansed with antiseptic solution, such as betadine or alcohol. Local anesthesia of the planned puncture site can be given either as an infiltration of lidocaine (or similar), or application of topical anesthesia. The patient is held still with gentle restraint. Since many children will be stimulated to urinate when the needle enters the bladder, the urethra is occluded, either by gently pitching the tip of the penis in boys, or with pressure on the urethral opening in girls. A thin needle (similar in gauge to one used for routine vein puncture) with a syringe is advanced until urine is withdrawn. Once adequate urine is collected, the needle is removed and any mild bleeding at the puncture site is stopped with gentle pressure. The urine sample is then sent to the laboratory for urinalysis and urine culture.  Complications  In children with full bladders verified by ultrasound, complications are rare. Small amounts of blood in the urine after the procedure is common and resolves quickly. Large amounts of blood in the urine or infection of the abdominal wall puncture site are rare. Puncture of the bowel with the needle can occur if a loop of intestine overlays the bladder, but peritonitis is rare with such a small puncture. This can be avoided with use of ultrasound.

The event is contested over a course that features 13 of the steepest hills in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. History The Dirty Dozen was founded in 1983 by brothers Tom and Danny Chew and their friend Bob Gottlieb, in an attempt to find and ride the steepest hills in Pittsburgh. Five riders participated in the first edition, though only three finished. The race has been held every year since 1983‚Äîexcept 1993. In 1984, the Dirty Dozen was contested twice: once in January and once in October. The 2016 edition of the race was the first in which co-founder and promoter Danny Chew did not participate. He broke his neck in a cycling crash in September 2016 and suffered permanent paralysis. Chew provided live commentary during the race via videolink, and the event itself served as a fundraiser for Chew's ongoing care and rehabilitation. Format Competitors ride between hills at a neutral pace, and a whistle signals the rolling start of each hill. The top male and female riders on each hill score points, with the first place male rider scoring 10 points and the tenth place receiving 1 point. Only the first five women score points, although the men and women ride together. The final standings are established by cumulative points throughout the event. In order to qualify as a finisher, riders must complete each hill in the event without losing forward progress or dismounting from the bicycle. If a rider fails to maintain forward progress, he or she must descend to the bottom of the hill and ride to the top under their own power. Route View from the top of one of the Dirty Dozen climbs, Canton Avenue The original Dirty Dozen route included 12 climbs, and there have been as many as 15, but since 1988 the race has typically featured the same baker's dozen of 13 hills.

Cromwell called him \\"the short man who would not bow.\\" He was theologically and politically aligned with Archibald Johnston, whose illuminating 3 volume diaries were lost until 1896, and not fully published until 1940. He was exempted from the general pardon at the restoration of the monarchy, tried on 6 charges, and hanged in Edinburgh. James Guthrie was born about 1612 and said to be son of Guthrie of that ilk. He graduated with an M.A. from St. Andrew's University. He subsequently became a regent in St Leonard's College, St Andrews. He was one of those whom the Assembly, 16 December 1638, found ready to supply vacancies. He was not ordained until a few year later when he was called to Lauder in 1642, where he stayed for 7 years. He was selected with three others to wait upon Charles I. at Newcastle in 1646 with a letter from the Assembly. He preached before Parliament on 10 January 1649, and was thanked by it. He was appointed a commissioner for visiting the Universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh that year. He was translated and admitted to the Church of the Holy Rude in Stirling in November 1650. He took an active and leading part in the business of the Church, and by a small majority in the Assembly got General, afterwards the Earl of Middleton, excommunicated, announcing the sentence from his own pulpit, notwithstanding an appeal by the King. He and Bennett, his colleague, were required by His Majesty and the Committee of Estates to repair to Perth, 19 February 1651, to answer for preaching against the Public Resolutions agreed to by Church and State in order to a levy, but they refused. He was deposed by the Assembly, 30 July following, for having joined in the Protestation against the lawfulness of that Assembly. He and others holding similar views thereupon formed a separate Church under the protection of Cromwell. Along with others of the Protesting brethren, having met in Edinburgh to draw up a congratulatory address and supplication to Charles II., he was seized and imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle 23 August 1660. His stipend was sequestrated 25 September, and he was removed to the prison of Dundee 20 October, from thence to Stirling and again to Edinburgh, where he wastried before Parliament, 25 May 1661, found guilty of treason, sentenced to death 28th, hanged at the Cross of Edinburgh on 1 June 1661. His head was placed on the Netherbow Port. The sentence of forfeiture was rescinded by Parliament 22 July 1690, and his skull, after being a public spectacle for about twenty-eight years, was removed by Alexander Hamilton, then a student at the University, who afterwards succeeded the Holy Rude Church in Stirling. From his determined support of Presbyterian principles, Guthrie was named sicker foot (the Scots term for a sure-footed person), the avowed leader of the Protesters, and their secretary and champion. He married Jane (buried in Greyfriars, 15th March 1673), who was the daughter of Ramsay of Sheilhill, and had issue ‚Äî William, died on the eve of being licensed at Edinburgh April 1674; Sophia, who, along with her mother, was in 1666 banished to a lonely prison in Shetland for having in their possession a copy of John Brown's Apologeticall Relation of the Particular Sufferings of the Faithful Ministers and Professors of the Church of Scotland. Early life and education James Guthrie from the Carslaw's easy-to-read book which has an account of his life and an appendix on his trial James Guthrie statue by Alexander Handyside Ritchie, Valley Cemetery, Stirling 1857 Guthrie, the eldest son of the laird of Guthrie, Forfarshire, was born about 1612. He was educated at St. Leonard's College, St. Andrews, where he graduated with an MA, and became one of the regents, distinguished for his lectures on philosophy. At this time Guthrie was an episcopalian, and is said to have been zealous for prelacy and the ceremonies. Yet on 16 December 1638 the strongly antiprelatic assembly at Glasgow put him in the list of those ready for ecclesiastical vacancies. In January 1639 Samuel Rutherford was made divinity professor at the University of St Andrews, and under his influence Guthrie became a Presbyterian. First charge at Lauder In 1642 he was ordained minister of Lauder, Berwickshire, and soon distinguished himself in the cause of the National Covenant. He was a member of the General Assembly from 1644 to 1651; in the first year he received (15 May) ¬£15 towards the expenses of his attendance from the Kirk session of Stow, Midlothian. In 1646 he was one of seven commissioners appointed by the Committee of Estates to wait on Charles I at Newcastle-on-Tyne with a letter from the general assembly whose purport was, according to Kilpatrick, to press on Charles Presbyterianism and the Solemn League and Covenant. He preached before the Scottish Parliament on 10 January 1649, and on 16 January before the parliamentary commission for the visitation of the University of St. Andrews. Next month a movement was made for his removal to Edinburgh. He preached on 13 July before the parliamentary commission for the visitation of the University of Edinburgh. In November he was translated to the Church of the Holy Rude in Stirling where he remained for ten years. Political background Engagers versus Remonstrants Carisbrooke Castle, where a secret agreement, or \\"Engagement\\", was signed to back Charles I with an army in return for implementing the Solemn League and Covenant albeit in a weakened, some would say a compromised, form. The origin of the dispute goes back to the year 1647, when, after difficult and intricate negotiations, Charles was delivered up to the English Parliament, and after an attempt to escape from Hampton Court was taken and committed as a prisoner to Carisbrooke Castle in the Isle of Wight. While there, a secret treaty was framed between him and representatives from Scotland, in which he agreed under certain conditions to accept the Solemn League and Covenant, and to establish Presbyterianism for three years in England. This treaty, known as the \\"Engagement,\\" though approved by the Scottish Parliament, was rejected and condemned by the Commission of Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which instructed every minister to preach against it, and to use his utmost influence to prevent the Marquis of Hamilton's expedition for the relief of the King from proving successful. The defeat of his army at Preston, while it extinguished the hopes of his party, widened the breach which had now been made in the once united ranks of the Covenanters. Two parties were formed, which regarded one another with unconcealed hostility: the Engagers, so called from the Engagement which Hamilton had made with the King; and the Remonstrants or strict Covenanters who were under the leadership of Warriston and Argyll. James Guthrie wanted the full force of the Covenants in national life in all parts of the kingdoms and opposed the Engagement and supporting the army which backed it; he became a Remonstrator. Resolutioners versus Protestors This breach was still further widened by an Act of the Scottish Parliament, known as the Act of Classes, which was passed on 23 January 1649, a week before Charles was beheaded. According to the act, the various ranks of Malignants or Engagers were declared incapable of holding any office of public trust or employment, whether in Church or in State. The first result of this Act was to throw the management of public affairs into the hands of those who were afterwards defeated by Cromwell at Dunbar in September 1650. Following Dunbar there was some soul-searching to determine what had gone wrong. This led to the Western Remonstrance which was read before the government on 22 October 1650 at Stirling. The Remonstrance was also considered by the Commission of Assembly starting on 25 November 1650. Essentially God was considered to have withdrawn his favour due to Achan-like sin at a personal and a national level. They did not shy away from listing even the king's sins. The proposed remedy was repentance and purification. Others took a different view and blamed the defeat at Dunbar on the purging of some 5000 able men from the army and therefore wanted the conditions for entry into the army relaxed. On 14 December 1650, the Commission of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at Perth replied to a question from the government as to who would be allowed to fight in the army. Following this reply the Parliament on 23 December 1650 passed its \\"Act of Levy\\" which in a contra-Gideon-like manner, expanded the list of those who would be allowed to fight. By and by, when the Engagers returned to power, the Act of Classes was repealed, and a new army was levied which, to a large extent, was officered and filled by men who were regarded as unfaithful to the Covenant. In favour of this proceeding, however, the Church, forsaking the higher sphere, issued certain Resolutions, which were strenuously protested against by a large and influential minority. Such was the origin of the controversy between the Resolutioners and Protesters, which raged with unabated animosity for many years. Those in favour of the loosening of the conditions for fighting were known as Resolutioners, a name derived from their approval of the resolutions of Commission and Parliament for the levy of 23rd December. The Church of Scotland was now unhappily split into two contending sections. Old friends who had fought side by side in earlier days became opponents, and there was much bitterness and occasionally misrepresentations, due in some cases to misunderstandings, exaggerated reports or false rumours. Of the Resolutioners, Robert Douglas was, by head and shoulders, the acknowledged leader. His ministerial supporters included David Dickson, Robert Baillie, and James Wood. Among the Protesters the most outstanding ministers were James Guthrie, Samuel Rutherfurd, Andrew Cant, Patrick Gillespie, and John Livingstone; and, of the elders, Wariston and Sir John Cheisly; the two most strenuous fighters being Guthrie and Wariston. Samuel Rutherford is known to have stayed with Guthrie in Stirling. Guthrie's political and theological views James Guthrie (Covenanter) From the first, Guthrie ranged himself amongst the Protesters, and, indeed, was generally regarded as one of their principal leaders. By this time he had been translated to Stirling, where he had, as his colleague, Mr. Bennett, a man of kindred spirit, with whom, on the questions of the day, he was generally in agreement. Hew Scott's later edition says Guthrie came to Stirling around November 1650 although Kilpatrick discusses 1649. Not satisfied with expressing in a letter to the Commission of Assembly their dissatisfaction with the aforesaid Resolutions, they continued to preach against them and to denounce them as involving the nation in sin. For this they were cited to appear before the Committee of Estates at Perth, where Charles II was now holding his Court, and, having done so, they refused to acknowledge the King's right to interfere with them in the discharge of their ministerial functions. :\\"This our protestation' they said, \\"we make, not from any disrespect to the King's Majesty or your Lordships' authority, nor from any purpose to decline or disobey the same in anything civil, but from the tender regard which we have and owe unto the liberties and privileges of the Church of Jesus Christ, which both the King's Majesty and your Lordships and we are in so solemn a way bound to maintain and preserve inviolable.\\" In 1650 Guthrie treated General John Middleton with a high-handedness which sealed his own fate. Middleton, who joined Charles II immediately on his landing on 23 June, took the lead in a project for a royalist army in the north. On 17 October Guthrie, by the \\"Western Remonstrance\\", withdrew from the royalist cause; on 14 December he sent a letter to the general assembly at Perth denouncing Middleton as an enemy of the Covenant, and proposing his excommunication. Guthrie was appointed to pronounce the sentence next Sunday, and, despite a letter from the assembly bidding him delay the act, carried out the original order. At the next meeting of the commission (2 January 1651) Middleton was loosed from the sentence after public penance. He never forgave the affront. The same meeting of commission which ordered Middleton's excommunication had passed a unanimous resolution authorising the acceptance of the military services of all but \\"obstinate\\" enemies of the covenant. Guthrie and his colleague, David Bennett, preached against this resolution. Summoned (19 February and 28 February) to Perth by the Committee of Estates to answer to the king for their conduct, they appeared, but, while acknowledging the king's civil authority, protested against his ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and declined to submit to what they called \\"a heighe prowoking the eiyes of the Lord's glorie\\". The attack on the resolution was led at the next meeting of the General Assembly at St. Andrews (16 July) by John Menzies, divinity professor in the Marischal College, Aberdeen, Guthrie strongly supported him. The assembly met by adjournment at Dundee (22 July), when a protestation against the action of the commission was read, those who had signed it absenting themselves, as from an unlawful assembly. The church was now divided into \\"resolutioners\\" and \\"protesters\\". Guthrie and two others were deposed by the assembly on 30 July; but for the alarm of Oliver Cromwell's approach, which dispersed the assembly, other \\"protesters\\" would have been similarly dealt with. A rupture took place in nearly every presbytery; the \\"protesters\\" met by themselves, and held their own synod in Edinburgh. They even turned for protection to Cromwell. On 8 August 1654 Guthrie was appointed by the English Privy Council one of the 'triers' and a visitor for the universities. A conference between \\"resolutioners\\" and \\"protesters\\" at Edinburgh was rendered abortive by the attitude of Guthrie and Warriston. At a riot in Stirling on the election (1656) of a successor to Bennett, Guthrie was attacked with stones by \\"resolutioners\\". Kirk Session records from the time still survive. Both parties appealed to Cromwell in London in 1656. The champion of the \\"resolutioners\\" was James Sharp, afterwards archbishop, whose arguments led Cromwell to refuse the plea of the \\"protesters\\" for a commission in their favour. Cromwell assured the \\"protesters\\" that he was \\"for monarchical government, and that in the person of the king\\"; yet there is no doubt that Guthrie's insistence on the king's rights injured his chances. The cause of the \\"protesters\\" was further weakened by the defection of some of them (including Menzies) to independency, a development which increased Guthrie's opposition to Cromwell's government.

The Restoration rendered the prospects of the \\"protesters\\" hopeless. Guthrie and nine others met in Edinburgh (23 August 1660) and drew up a \\"humble petition\\" to the king setting forth their loyalty, and reminding him of his obligations as a covenanter. The meeting was ordered to disperse, and as the warning was unheeded arrests were made. Guthrie was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. On 25 September his stipend was sequestrated. He was transferred to Dundee on 20 October, and thence to Stirling, where he remained till his trial. On 20 February 1661 he was arraigned for high treason before the parliament, Middleton presiding as commissioner. The indictment had six counts. The charges against Guthrie were six in number: (1) His contriving, consenting to, and exhibiting before the Committee of Estates the paper called The Western Remonstrance. (2) His contriving, writing, and publishing the abominable pamphlet called \\"The Causes of God's wrath.\\" (3) His contriving, writing and subscribing the paper called \\"The Humble Petition,\\" of the 23 of August last, when he was apprehended. (4) His convocating of the King's lieges at several times, without warrant or authority, to the disturbance of the peace of the State and of the Church. (5) His refusal, by appeal and protest presented at Perth, to acknowledge the King as judge in certain matters. (6) Some treasonable expressions alleged to have been used by him in a meeting, in 1650 or 1651. On 20 February 1651, his indictment being read, Guthrie delivered an excellent speech, which may be found in Wodrow's History. Expressing the hope that the Lord Commissioner (Middleton, who was known to have a grudge against him) would \\"patiently and without interruption\\" hear him, he reminded his judges that the law of God, referred to in the indictment, is the supreme law, not only of religion, but also of righteousness, and that all laws and Acts of Parliament are to be understood and expounded in the light of our solemn vows and covenants. The contriving of the \\"western remonstrance\\" and the rejection of the king's ecclesiastical authority were, from a legal point of view, the most formidable charges. In the preparation of his defence he surprised his counsel by the accuracy of his knowledge of Scots law. The trial was not concluded until 11 April. Guthrie's closing appeal made a strong impression. Several members withdrew; but only Tweeddale spoke in his favour, proposing banishment in place of the extreme penalty. On 28 May parliament ordered him to be hanged at the cross of Edinburgh on 1 June, in company with William Govan, an obscure deserter. Robert Traill, at the age of nineteen, stood beside Guthrie, his father's friend, on the scaffold. Guthrie's farewell letter (1 June 1661) to his wife shows great strength of character. At eleven o'clock the same day he signed a paper to dispose of the rumour that he was willing to retract. At dinner he called for cheese, saying his physicians had forbidden it, but he was beyond the need of such precautions. He spoke at the scaffold for about an hour, leaving a copy of his speech to be given to his son when he came of age. He is also reported to have left his ring with his niece. Opportunities of escape, he said, he had rejected, as flight might be taken as an admission of guilt. At the last moment he \\"raised the napkin from his eyes\\", and lifted up his voice for the covenants. His head was fixed on the Nether Bow port. : The legend runs that, a few weeks later, drops of blood fell from it on to Middleton's coach, making a new cover necessary, as \\"all the art of man could not wash out\\" the indelible stains. In 1688 Alexander Hamilton, a divinity student (died 29 January 1738, minister of Stirling), removed the head and buried it. The headless trunk was laid out by \\"ladies of quality\\", who dipped their handkerchiefs in the blood, George Stirling pouring \\"a phial of fragrant ointment\\" on the corpse; it was interred in the aisle of St. Giles' Church. Legacy James Guthrie's chair. This along with his portrait and ring are kept at the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum. Guthrie's ring also features in a modern painting called The Stirling Smith Girl. Guthrie's age at death was \\"about 49\\". cites Hew Scott He is celebrated as one of the first of the martyrs of the covenant, James Renwick being one of the last. The two are thus commemorated in the inscription upon the ‚Äòmartyrs' monument‚Äô in the Greyfriars' churchyard, Edinburgh, the Westminster Abbey of Scotland: :But as for them, no cause was to be found :Worthy of death but only they were found, :Constant and steadfast, zealous witnessing :For the Prerogatives of CHRIST their KING :Which Truths were seal'd by famous Guthrie's head, :And all along to Mr. Renwick's blood, :They did endure the wrath of enemies :Reproaches, torments, deaths and injuries :But yet they're those who from such troubles came :And now triumph in glory with the LAMB. The monument marks Renwick's burial-place, being fixed to the wall close to the spot where criminals were interred. The Scottish parliament reversed the attainder on 22 July 1690. His name (\\"famous Guthrie's head\\") is commemorated in the rude lines on the \\"martyrs' monument\\" in Greyfriars Churchyard, Edinburgh. By his party he was called \\"Sickerfoot\\" (\\"Sure-foot\\").

She was born in Hampden, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand in 1889. Her subsequent trial and conviction became a subject of contemporary controversy for New Zealand socialist and feminist campaigners due to the perceived severity of her sentence compared to male criminals. Early Life: 1889-1915 Parkinson was one of the children of George Parkinson, a farm labourer and Isabella Beazley. Her parents belonged to the Salvation Army of New Zealand. She left home at fourteen years of age (1903) and undertook a period of initial domestic service in Hastings in the Hawkes Bay area of New Zealand, until she moved to Napier and later became a pantrymaid at the Masonic and General Hotels in that same city, in 1909. At that time, she became involved with Walter West, a railway worker, and had a relationship with him, which lasted for six years. Parkinson became pregnant in 1914 but produced a stillbirth on 1 January 1915.Harry Holland: \\"A Plea for Alice Parkinson\\" Maoriland Worker: 28 July 1915: 4 Manslaughter and Trial (1915) Although Walter West had initially promised to wed Parkinson, he ultimately broke that promise. Resultantly, in March 1915, she travelled to Nelson Crescent in Napier, and shot him in the head and chest, thereafter trying to kill herself through a bullet wound to her temple. She was convicted of manslaughter due to the perceived provocation involved and Chief Justice Stout sentenced her to life imprisonment and hard labour at Christchurch's Addington Prison Holland, 1915:4 Imprisonment, Release and Death (1915-1921, 1949) However, her conviction and imprisonment did not prevent the emergence of a widespread leniency campaign. Harry Holland and his Social Democrat Party (New Zealand), as well as the New Zealand Truth newspaper all campaigned for her early release. The Release Alice Parkinson campaign rallies were well-attended publicly. Socialist and feminist organisations also mobilised and Parkinson was released in 1921, into the custody of her widowed mother in Tinokino. Thereafter, she married Charles O'Loughlin, a carpenter in 1924. They had several children together and O'Loughlin died in 1942.

Parkinson's supporters took the opportunity to call for female entry to professional occupations like the New Zealand Police, judiciary, jury trial composition reform, prison service and parliamentary representation.

History The company was founded as WeatherBill in 2006 by two former Google employees, David Friedberg and Siraj Khaliq. The company began as a startup focused on helping people and businesses manage and adapt to climate change, by providing weather insurance to ski resorts, large event venues, and farmers. In 2010 it decided to focus exclusively on agriculture, and launched the Total Weather Insurance Product in fall 2010 for corn and soybeans. On October 11, 2011, WeatherBill changed its name to The Climate Corporation. In June 2013 the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency authorized the Climate Corporation to administer federal crop insurance policies for the 2014 crop year. In October, 2013 Monsanto announced that it was acquiring the company for approximately $1.1 billion. In November 2013 the company launched Climate Basic and Climate Pro, a set of advisory tools for farmers utilizing data science to help farmers make optimal decisions. In February 2014 the company announced it merged with Monsanto‚Äôs Integrated Farming System and Precision Planting divisions. In February 2014 the company also acquired Solum, a soil-testing company based in Ames, Iowa. In December 2014 the company acquired 640 Labs, an agricultural technology startup based in Chicago. In July 2015 the company sold its crop insurance business to AmTrust Financial Services, enabling The Climate Corporation to focus exclusively on its digital agriculture platform. Details of the agreement were not disclosed. In September 2015 the company re- branded its Climate Basic and Climate Pro products as Climate FieldView. In November 2015 the company signed a definitive agreement with John Deere to acquire Precision Planting LLC. In March 2016, the company announced data connectivity agreements with several agronomic retailers and retailer software systems through the use of APIs. In May 2017 the agreement to sell Precision Planting LLC to John Deere was terminated. In August 2016 the U.S. Department of Justice had filed a lawsuit to block the sale, arguing the deal could make it more expensive for farmers to use fast, precise planting technology. Precision Planting CEO Michael Stern stated: \\"We just didn't see that there was a clear path going forward, that the DOJ was going to approve the transaction. We have a valuable business and people in limbo and it was just time to move on.\\" Products Formerly Climate Basic and Climate Pro, the Climate Corporation re-branded its product to Climate FieldView, making the announcement at the 2015 Farm Progress Show. The Climate FieldView Platform uses data science based on historical crop, field and weather data to provide farmers insights and data of their fields. Nitrogen Advisor provides farmers a look into nitrogen levels in soil based on historical weather data helping them to determine when to make applications. Field Health Advisor provides farmers satellite images of their fields depicting crop health and vegetation maps. Script Creator allows farmers to create variable-rate prescriptions before planting. Climate FieldView Drive is a Bluetooth enabled device that plugs into a tractor or combine and reads machine data during planting and harvest. The data is displayed in real-time to the Climate FieldView Cab app. Climate FieldView Prime includes weather and scouting. It allows farmers to see a weather forecast up to three hours in advance and the ability to scout potential issues in the field. Farmers can drop a pin on that location on the map to scout the precise location throughout the season.

Born in Wellington, New Zealand, Parkinson was commissioned as a lieutenant in the New Zealand Military Forces in 1916 and served in the First World War as part of the New Zealand Field Artillery. He remained in the military during the interwar period and served in a number of staff and training positions. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, he commanded an artillery regiment in the Western Desert Campaign and participated in the Battle of Greece. In late 1941 he returned to New Zealand to command newly raised formations, but returned to the Middle East in 1943. He commanded the 6th Infantry Brigade of the 2nd New Zealand Division during the Italian Campaign, at one stage taking over temporary command of the division itself. After the war he served as Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Military Forces. He finished his military career in command of the Southern Military District. After his retirement in 1952, he lived in Christchurch. In his later years he was involved with the St. John Ambulance Association. He died in 1979 at the age of 82. Early life Parkinson was born on 5 November 1896 in the Wellington suburb of Mount Cook. His parents were Henry Parkinson, a school teacher, and Ethel Constance Young. Parkinson was schooled at Greytown School and Newtown District High School. He also attended Wellington College for the final two years of his education. In 1913, he sat and passed the entrance examination for the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Australia, which set aside a limited number of enrolments for New Zealanders. He entered Duntroon the following year and graduated in April 1916. Military career Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal New Zealand Artillery, Parkinson was posted to Trentham Military Camp where he was an instructor. Nearly a year later, in June 1917, he joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and embarked for the Western Front. He acquitted himself well in his duties with the New Zealand Field Artillery (NZFA) and became known as a reliable officer. By the end of the war, he was brigade major of the NZFA. He returned to New Zealand in 1919 and took up a posting as adjutant to the Wellington Garrison Artillery Division. In 1920, Parkinson was part of the Fiji Expeditionary Force. This was raised following a request from the Fijian government for military forces to support local police dealing with striking labourers and farmers. The force, numbering about 55 men and under the command of the then Major Edward Puttick, was based on Fiji for two months before returning home. Promoted to captain the following year, he spent two years in Dunedin instructing the Territorial Force artillery, before being posted to Auckland. There, he was in charge of harbour defences. In 1925, he was sent to a gunnery course in England and, for the following two years, was seconded to the Royal Artillery. He returned to New Zealand in 1927, accompanied by his wife Barbara Waiohine Howe, who he had married in Birmingham on 30 August the previous year. A series of staff and instructional postings in Wellington, and then Auckland, followed. He was promoted to major in 1932. In 1937, Parkinson was made commander of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, having been made a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was demoted to major the following year; this reduction in rank was as a result of disciplinary action after using the workshop facilities at Trentham Military Camp for personal work. In 1939, he was returned to his temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. A lot of his work as commander of the artillery involved the implementing programs for the upskilling of gunners and non-commissioned officers to perform leadership roles normally the preserve of officers. Likewise, officers were expected to learn basic gunnery tasks. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Parkinson's rank was made substantive and was later seconded to the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). He was given command of the 4th Field Artillery Regiment and embarked with the First Echelon of the 2NZEF in early 1940. After serving in the initial stages of the Western Desert Campaign, for which he was mentioned in despatches, he led the regiment well during the Battle of Greece. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), gazetted on 14 April 1942, due in part to his service during the battle. Brigadier Graham Parkinson studies his map a few miles behind the lines of the Italian battlefront, November 1943 In late 1941, Parkinson, newly promoted to brigadier, returned to New Zealand to take over the recently formed 1st New Zealand Army Tank Brigade. After Japan's entry into the war, he became commander of the 7th Infantry Brigade, the army reserve in New Zealand, for several months before reverting to his previous command. The tank brigade was eventually disbanded when the 4th Infantry Brigade, based in Egypt, was converted to armour. Parkinson returned to the Middle East and took over command of the 6th Infantry Brigade. He led the brigade during the final stages of the war in North Africa before taking it to Italy. In early March 1944, Parkinson became temporary major general and commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division after its nominal commander, Howard Kippenberger, was wounded. At the time, the New Zealanders, as part of the New Zealand Corps, were participating in the Battle of Monte Cassino. An offensive, largely planned by Kippenberger and involving the division, began on 15 March. Parkinson, already doubting the chances of a successful outcome, failed to follow Kippenberger's directions for dispersion of his troops and did not allow sufficient infantry to enter Monte Cassino immediately following an intensive air bombardment. Although later criticised for being overly cautious during the battle, he was awarded a bar to his DSO for his leadership during this time. After Monte Cassino and the return of Lieutenant General Bernard Freyberg to command of the 2nd New Zealand Division, Parkinson went back to lead the 6th Infantry Brigade. From June to August 1944, he was appointed Commander, Royal Artillery, of the division's artillery, replacing Brigadier Stephen Weir, before returning to 6th Infantry Brigade. His brigade performed well in the later stages of the Italian Campaign. For his services during the fighting in Italy, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire and was also made an Officer of the United States Legion of Merit. Later life After a period in command of all 2NZEF troops in Egypt, Parkinson returned to New Zealand in late 1945 and was appointed Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Military Forces, based in Wellington. After serving in this capacity for nearly a year, he was posted to London for a three-year term as the New Zealand military liaison officer. In 1949, he took up command of the Southern Military District. He retired from the military in 1952 with the rank of major general. In his later years, Parkinson lived in Christchurch and was involved with the St John Ambulance Association for which he was appointed an Officer of the Order of St. John. He died on 10 July 1979, survived by his wife. The couple had no children. He is buried at Ruru Lawn Cemetery in Christchurch.

He was born in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1908; John was his twin brother. He designed airport terminal buildings for Christchurch International Airport (late 1950s), Wellington International Airport (late 1960s), and Rarotonga International Airport (early 1970s). He commenced architectural training and worked under Cecil Wood. In England, he worked for the Tecton Group. After returning to Christchurch, he went into partnership with Wood for just over a year but worked on his own from 1938. In 1945, he was joined by Humphrey Hall, and over the next ten years, they designed many domestic buildings. Shortly after dissolving the partnership in 1955, Pascoe won the commission to design the new terminal building for Christchurch Airport. By August 1955, Pascoe had developed sketch plans for a terminal building. By October, the design work was \\"well advanced\\". From December 1955 to March 1956, Pascoe went on a study tour and amongst other things, he studied airport buildings in Singapore (Paya Lebar Air Base), Z√ºrich (Z√ºrich Airport), Amsterdam (Amsterdam Airport Schiphol), Copenhagen (Copenhagen Airport), three terminals in the UK, and sixteen terminals in the USA. Upon his return, he reported on the need to significantly increase the size of the terminal based on what he had learned, but there were also some additional requests by the airport administration. The airport terminal was built by Fletcher Construction from late 1957, and it was opened on 10 June 1959. Two of Pascoe's designs are listed with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. One is the 1948 Pascoe House in 58 Colenso Street, Sumner, Christchurch, which was listed as Category II on 31 March 2000. The other is the design of the 1955 extension to the Christ's College Chapel. While the size of the chapel doubled, the Gothic Revival appearance of the school's quadrangle did not change. During his secondary school time, Peter Beaven had a conversation with Pascoe that led him to choose architecture as a career. Pascoe could be eccentric, and he would leave during important meetings because he always went to bed at 9pm. He died at his holiday home in Springfield on 11 September 1976.

John Pascoe received his education at Sumner School and Christ's College. He joined his father's law firm and studied the subject, but did not graduate. Career Pascoe was bored with legal work, so he enquired with Joe Heenan, the under-secretary for the Department of Internal Affairs, whether there were employment opportunities. Pascoe was put on a team working on the 1940 centennial publications, and he thus moved to Wellington. Pascoe was the founding secretary of the National Historic Places Trust in 1955. In 1960 he was controller of the Wildlife Branch. As National Archivist, he convinced the government statistician to keep the 1966 census forms for future research. Unlike most other countries, New Zealand had never kept its census forms, and upon Pascoe's initiative, the 1976 and 1986 forms were subsequently also kept and are in secure storage. Mountaineering Pascoe climbed extensively throughout the South Island of New Zealand conquering many previously unclimbed peaks. It is claimed he conquered over 100 peaks, of which some 23 were previously unclimbed. For his work on New Zealand mountaineering, literature, mapping and photography, he was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.

He was born in West Oxford, Canterbury, New Zealand in 1887. His parents, Josef Pawelka and Louise Konig, were Moravian immigrants to New Zealand. In 1900, thirteen-year-old Joseph was apprenticed to an uncle as a butcher. By 1908, he had made his way to the North Island city of Palmerston North, where he contracted typhoid fever and was hospitalised for five months. On 29 September 1909, he married Hannah Wilson, but made a suicide attempt in December 1909. Thereafter, Hannah made out a separation order against her husband. A daughter, Iris, was born in July 1910 to the estranged couple. Imprisonment and Escapes: February 1910- August 1911 On February 25, 1910, Pawelka and Hannah turned up at Palmerston North police station, where Hannah accused her estranged husband of breaching their separation order. Hannah sought police protection and during the police search of his house, Pawelka was found to have an unregistered firearm and stolen goods from several hitherto unsolved burglaries. Consequently, Pawelka was then arrested and charged with theft. He appeared in the Palmerston North Magistrates Court on March 7, 1910, but escaped from custody five days later, on 12 March 1910. He was apprehended at the neighbouring community of Awahuri on 14 March 1910 and transferred to Wellington's Terrace Gaol. On 23 March, Pawelka took advantage of a negligently unlocked door after a constable had transferred a cellmate out of his cell, and promptly escaped from custody again, making his way north. On April 2, he robbed a Palmerston North couple, Mr and Mrs. Kendall, and on April 5, 1910, Palmerston North High School and a shop were burnt down through arson. On April 9, 1910, Pawleka appeared at his wife and mother-in- law's residence and threatened both Sell, 2009: 169 On April 10, 1910, he made a burglary attempt on the home of a local butcher, and in the melee that resulted, Police Sargeant John McGuire was wounded by gunfire. He died of the injury on 14 April 1910 Sell, 2009: 171 On April 20, 1910, Constables James Thompson and John Gallagher finally recaptured Pawelka at a cowshed in Ashhurst, an outlying Palmerston North suburb. Over the next month, there were several Supreme Court cases, in which he was acquitted of the shooting of Constable McGuire and the robbery, but convicted of theft, arson and escape from police custody.Sell, 2009: 172 On June 8, 1910, Justice Theophilus Cooper sentenced Pawelka to twenty one years imprisonment, provoking a public outcry given the relative severity of the sentence. Subsequently, Pawelka made three more prison escape attempts, on 11, 14 and 17 August 1911. In the latter case, he remained free for an hour. Finally, on 27 August 1911, he removed a grille above his cell and was last seen absconding toward Wellington's Botanical Gardens Sell, 2009: 174 Pawelka was never recaptured and his ultimate fate remains a mystery, although his escapades have earned him occasional inclusion in New Zealand criminal history accounts Bronwyn Sell, Law Breakers and Mischief Makers: Fifty Notorious New Zealanders: Allen and Unwin: Crows Nest, NSW: 2009: Graham Hutchins: Bad: New Zealand Crooks, Cranks, Creeps and Killers: Auckland: Hodder Moa: 2010 References Category:1887 births Category:People from Oxford, New Zealand Category:New Zealand criminals Category:New Zealand people of Czech descent Category:1918 deaths ","title":"Joseph Pawelka"},{"id":"34355414","text":"Sree Ramu College of Arts & Science .http://www.sreeramucas.org/ also known as \\"SREE RAMU CAS\\" or simply \\"SRC\\", is a college situated in the outskirts of Pollachi.

Director Albert Rogell who had moved from shorts to B-films, had been interested in aviation having already helmed a similar feature, The Flying Marine (1929). In Air Hostess, the studio had attempted to merge flying and romance.

Knapp was being touted as a future star, with a starring role in Sinner's Holiday (1930), but eventually lost her A-status and was relegated to such B-fare as Air Hostess. Plot In World War I, pilot Bob King is shot and killed in France. His friends Ted \\"Lucky\\" Hunter (James Murray) and Pa Kearns (J.M. Kerrigan) pledge to look after his daughter, Kitty (Evalyn Knapp). Years later, after the war, Kearns, now blind, works at an airport as an engine expert while Kitty is a TWA stewardess. Her father's friends still look after her as meddling chaperones. A grandstanding Ted flies over the airport, meeting Kitty who is enamored with him. After a night on the town, he flies her back to the airport, but is met by angry mechanics and pilot Dick Miller (Arthur Pierson), who is in love with Kitty and ends up in a fight. Ted soon announces his marriage to Kitty and forces her to quit her job. Dick gets her her job back when Ted is unable to make a living. Rich, three-time divorcee Sylvia Carleton (Thelma Todd) offers Ted a chance to build a radical new aircraft that can fly across the Pacific. A t√™te-√†-t√™te between Ted and Sylvia in Albuquerque turns into a fiasco when Kitty and Dick arrive to find them both drunk. Kitty leaves angrily for home, boarding a train that Ted and Dick learn is headed for a collapsing bridge. Both men try to save Kitty by flying to warn the engineer. Ted crash-lands on the tracks and wrecks his aircraft, but stops the train in time. Dick flies him back to the hospital with Kitty, as the couple reunites.

Aerial scenes in Air Hostess were reprised from earlier films.Wynne 1987, p. 171. In 1933, the film industry became more safety-conscious, with screen air crashes largely replaced by the use of appropriate scenes clipped from earlier epics such as Wings (1927), Hell's Angels (1930) and The Dawn Patrol (1930).Farmer 1984, p. 4. Aircraft used in the film include: Reception Considered along with other aviation films of the era, Air Hostess is a modest, B-film but has some redeeming qualities that have stood the film well over the years. A contemporary review in The New York Times noted: \\"... is pleasantly acted by James Murray, Arthur Pierson and Evalyn Knapp. Thelma Todd interprets the seductive blonde so heavily as to flavor the whole picture with a tinge of burlesque. Some of the air sequences have their moments of excitement, but Air Hostess needs more than airplanes to conceal the antiquity of its plot.\\"\\"Movie Review:Air Hostess (1933), An Air Melodrama.\\" The New York Times, January 23, 1933. In reviewing Air Hostess in a historical sense, the extensive use of the aircraft of the period now provides a near-documentary look at North American civil aviation in 1933.

Early life  Pearse was born in Bowling, Dunbartonshire, Scotland in 1893. Her parents were George Weeks and Elizabeth (n√©e Stephenson). She was educated at the Glasgow School of Art and London Central School of Art and Design.  Career  Pearse was appointed Curator of the Dunedin Public Art Gallery in 1946, a position she held until retiring in 1964. She was the first woman to hold such a position in New Zealand. During her tenure, Pearse made a number of trips to Britain to acquire artworks for the gallery. Most notably, she secured the donation of Archdeacon F.H.D Smythe's extensive collection of British watercolours - 1,300 works painted between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries. She also formed relationships with other collectors such as Doris Monheimer, Dorothy Theomin and Eleanor Joachim, all of whom made bequests of art to the gallery on their deaths. One of her most outstanding acquisitions was Thomas Gainsborough and John Hoppner‚Äôs full-length portrait of Charlotte, Countess Talbot, purchased in 1958. Much of Pearse's success in acquisitions was due to her personal relationship with Sir Alec Martin, chair of the auction house Christie's from 1940 to 1958. She also developed an association with the National Art Collection Fund, an organisation dedicated to assisting art galleries in locating and acquiring art for display. In addition to expanding the collection, Pearse was responsible for improving the range of objects displayed in the gallery, and the quality of their presentation. The gallery's building was expanded and developed and the exhibition programme was improved. The main criticism of Pearse's curation of the gallery was that she largely ignored contemporary New Zealand art. In 1963, the gallery society commissioned a report on the collection ‚Äì Esmond de Beer concluded that the collection was deficient in this regard and recommended a focus on acquiring local art. Pearse retired to Alexandra, Central Otago, in 1964 and lived there til her death in 1981. On her retirement, the National Art Collection Fund presented her with a gift of an eighteenth-century French bust, in recognition of her services to art. The bust is in the collection of the Dunedin Public Art Gallery.  Personal life  In 1917, Pearse married Leonard George Pearse in Portsmouth, England. They had one daughter the following year, then in 1923 emigrated to New Zealand and farmed in Central Otago. Leonard Pearse died in Auckland in 1942. The Pearses' daughter, Fiona, published memoirs in 2010, which included stories about her parents' lives and careers.

Early life The son of Isaac Hodgson and Elizabeth, daughter of William Rawes, he was born at Swindale, in the parish of Shap, Westmoreland, on 4 November 1779; his father was a stonemason. Hodgson studied at the grammar school of Bampton from the age of seven to nineteen. He learned a good deal of classics, mathematics, chemistry, botany, and geology, and acquired an interest in natural history and local antiquities, through rambles in the countryside. His parents were too poor to make a university education possible, and at the age of twenty he started work as the master of the village school at Matterdale, near Ullswater. He soon moved to a school at Stainton, near Penrith. Early in 1801 he was appointed to the school of Sedgefield in County Durham, where the endowment was ¬£20. The rector of Sedgefield, George Barrington, was a nephew of Shute Barrington, the Bishop of Durham, and his curates supported Hodgson. Clergyman and antiquarian Hodgson was offered an appointment as director of some ironworks near Newcastle, with a salary of ¬£300 a year, but turned it down. In 1802, however, he failed an examination for Holy Orders. In poor health, he left Sedgefield in 1803, for the mastership of the school at Lanchester, County Durham. There in 1804, he succeeded in passing his examination for ordination, and became curate of the chapelries of Esh and Saltley, hamlets in the parish of Lanchester, where he still kept his school. In 1806, Hodgson left Lanchester for the curacy of Gateshead; in 1808 he was presented by a private patron, Mr. Ellison, with the living of Jarrow with Heworth.*St Mary's Church, Heworth The income barely amounted to ¬£100 a year; it was congenial to Hodgson's tastes to serve the church, which had been founded by Bede. In 1810 he married Jane Bridget, daughter of Richard Kell, a stone merchant, of his parish. In 1821, Hodgson visited London, and made an expedition to Oxford for the purposes of his researches. He was also busy in raising money for a new church at Heworth, which he designed himself. It replaced an older chapel,Tyne and Wear HER(511): Heworth chapel ‚Äì Details. was built for Hodgson by John Stokoe,Diocese of Durham document (PDF), p. 4. and was consecrated in May 1822. Conservation work in the graveyard gave Hodgson the topic for a paper, a biography of Richard Dawes.John Sykes, Local Records: or, Historical register of remarkable events, which have occurred in Northumberland and Durham, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Berwick upon Tweed Volume 1 (1833), p. 257; Google Books. A find of a coin hoard, with coins of Ecgfrith of Northumbria, however, turned out to consist of recent fakes when they were analysed in the 1980s, following doubts raised in 1956.Tyne and Wear HER(524): Heworth, supposed Anglo-Saxon coins in a pot ‚Äì Details.Philip Grierson, Mark Blackburn, Medieval European Coinage: The early Middle Ages (5th‚Äì10th centuries) (2007), p. 338; Google Books. Heworth Church. In 1823, Bishop Barrington presented Hodgson to the vicarage of Kirkwhelpington, a country parish in the centre of Northumberland. His obligation to the new church at Heworth, which had not yet been paid for, made it desirable that he should continue to hold the living of Jarrow until the parish of Heworth had been separated from it. This he continued to do, appointing two curates, till 1833, and had troubles in consequence. At Kirkwhelpington he was near two students of local antiquities, Sir John Edward Swinburne of Capheaton Hall, and Walter Calverley Trevelyan of Wallington, who gave him encouragement. Later life and death Hodgson's health was failing, and he lost three children. In 1833 he was appointed to the vicarage of the neighbouring parish of Hartburn, with a larger income. After much illness, he died on 12 June 1845, and was buried at Hartburn. Mining safety In May 1812 there was a colliery explosion, now called the Felling mine disaster, at the Felling pit in Hodgson's parish; it caused the death of 92 people. The owners were Brandling, Henderson & Grace.Durham Mining Museum page, Felling Colliery. Hodgson wrote about the accident in the Newcastle Courant, against the owners' wishes;NEIMME page , citing County Durham Industries ‚Äì Coal Mining from Comprehensive Guide to the County of Durham by John Roberts Boyle (1892). he appealed for help for the widows and orphans, and published his funeral sermon, to which he prefixed an account of the accident. This book, An Account of the Explosion at Felling (Newcastle, 1813), has an accurate account of the colliery, accompanied by a plan of the workings, and is one of the few trustworthy records of the old system of coal- mining; parts are reprinted in James Raine's Life of Hodgson. John James Wilkinson, a London barrister with a Durham background, saw Hodgson's pamphlet, and published his own Proposals for the establishment of a Society for the Prevention of Accidents in Coal Mines. Bishop Shute Barrington saw Wilkinson's work, and gave Robert Gray, then at Bishopwearmouth, a free hand in setting up a society. The Society for Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines first met on 1 October 1813, with Hodgson on the committee.Durham Mining Museum page, Society for Preventing Accidents In Coal Mines. For the next few years Hodgson was employed in making experiments and attending meetings of the Society. Another founder member was William Reid Clanny, a pioneer of the safety lamp.Durham Mining Museum page, William Reid Clanny, M.D., F.R.S. One of the first moves by the Society (commonly called the \\"Sunderland Society\\") was agitation for the calling of a coroner's inquest in the cases of mining deaths, something mine owners had resisted; and Sir John Bayley raised the topic at the 1814 Newcastle Assizes. In November, John Buddle, a colliery manager, engineer and viewer, published a report on the ventilation of mines.Robert Nelson Boyd, Coal Mines Inspection: its history and results (1879), pp. 26‚Äì7; archive.org. In 1815, Hodgson visited the Dudley coal-field, examining some of the means of preventing colliery accidents. These were not satisfactory. Robert Gray asked Sir Humphry Davy for assistance, and Davy visited Newcastle in August, meeting Hodgson and Buddle. Back in London Davy worked with Michael Faraday and identified \\"firedamp\\" as methane. The research led to the Davy lamp, and Hodgson's help was acknowledged.In Philosophical Transactions, New Researches on Flame, 1817. Hodgson himself was one of the first to venture into a mine with the new lamp and explain its principle to the colliers. The History of Northumberland In 1817 Hodgson began his major work, the History of Northumberland. It became a classic model, in terms of plan and completeness of execution. In 1819 Hodgson visited London to work in the British Museum, and announced his book to appear in six volumes, published by subscription, limited to three hundred copies. The plan of the work was that the first volume should contain the general history of the county, the next three volumes a detailed account of the towns and villages, and the last two records and papers relating to border history. After difficulties with printers and engravers the first volume of this series appeared in 1820. It was not till 1827 that Hodgson was able to publish the second volume of his original prospectus, dealing with the parochial history of Northumberland, towards which he was helped by a subscription of ¬£200 from Bishop Barrington. In 1828 was published the sixth volume, containing fresh documents and records. In 1832 another volume of the parochial history followed. The book met with little immediate success, and Hodgson suffered a loss on each volume. In 1835 he published an extra volume of his history, containing the Pipe rolls for Northumberland. In 1839 the third volume of the parochial history appeared, containing an account of the Roman wall; in it Hodgson first clearly established the claim of Emperor Hadrian to be considered as its builder. His health, however, gave way while this volume was passing through the press. Hodgson used, amongst other sources, notes of Thomas Bell of the Society of Antiquaries.Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, Manuscript collections at Woodhorn. He did much research in the library at Capheaton.National Archives, Swinburne (Capheaton) Estate Records. He left a hundred volumes of manuscript collectanea for the completion of his work. Later, the Antiquarian Society of Newcastle upon Tyne commissioned John Hodgson-Hinde to write an additional volume containing an introductory sketch of the history of the county, which was published in 1858. The parochial history, as Hodgson had planned it, remained unfinished; proposals were made in 1891 for securing its completion. The Northumberland County History Committee was set up, and produced over more than 30 years a 15-volume continuation. Other works The Roman camp of Longovicium at Lanchester attracted Hodgson's attention, and led him to study Roman antiquities. In 1807 he published Poems written at Lanchester; one of them is Langovicum, a Vision, is an account of the Roman camp. The volume was accompanied with antiquarian notes, which were used by Robert Surtees in his History of Durham. In 1810 he was employed to write the account of Northumberland for Edward Wedlake Brayley and John Britton's Beauties of England and Wales. It is generally thought that Hodgson's work is the best of that series of short county histories. In 1812 he wrote for a Newcastle publisher The Picture of Newcastle-on-Tyne, a guide- book to the town, including research about the Roman Wall and the early history of the coal trade. Hodgson was also involved in the foundation of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, which came into existence in 1813. The first three volumes of the Transactions of this society contain many papers by him. He collected materials for a history of his parish of Jarrow, which he never finished; his work on the subject is to be found in Arch√¶ologia √Üliana, i. 112, and Collectanea Topographica, i. 66, &c.; ii. 40, &c.; Besides the works already mentioned Hodgson published The Nativity of Jesus Christ, &c.; (Newcastle, 1810), and contributed papers to the Gentleman's Magazine from 1821 onwards, under the signature \\"Arch√¶us\\". A portrait of Hodgson, from a miniature by Miss Mackreth, was prefixed to vol. ii. part ii. of his History, and is reproduced in Raine's Memoir.

The company was founded in the late 1990s by Fraser Laing. Originally specialising in eyewear, Arckiv eventually became a menswear label in 2010 after its eyewear division became a separate company.  History  Arckiv began as an eyewear specialist in the late 1990s, producing its own original designs but being notable for its extensive library of museum grade, antique, prototype and vintage frames, quickly becoming a renowned specialist in eyewear. The company eventually moved into the design of clothing and accessories. After splitting in 2010 to form two distinct companies, Arckiv became solely focused on menswear, while General Eyewear became a stand-alone company and brand formed from the continuation of the original eyewear division. Arckiv as a label took much of its inspiration from military uniforms and labourer workwear, and its collections were categorised into three separate lines entitled Nomadic (military), Ceremonial (dress wear) and Protective (labourer and workwear). The Arckiv fashion house presents only autumn/winter collections rather than the more archetypical two collections a year, which include spring/summer. Arckiv presents its yearly collection on Menswear Day during London Fashion Week (September) and follows it in February with a curated exhibition of the brand in place of a spring/summer collection. Since its first runway collection in 2010, Arckiv has been featured in numerous magazines, including Dazed & Confused, Arena Homme+ and LOVE Magazine and has featured in a number of their fashion editorials.

It originally aired on Showtime on October 23, 2011. Carrie's surveillance warrant nears its expiration, making her more desperate. Brody increases his presence in the public eye, but finds more turmoil in his personal life. Plot Brody (Damian Lewis), now promoted to gunnery sergeant, is in the midst of a string of public appearances which have made him an extremely popular figure. The Vice President's chief advisor Elizabeth Gaines (Linda Purl) talks to David Estes (David Harewood). She is interested in possibly recruiting Brody to run for public office but has questions about his mental stability. Brody gets a ride home from Mike (Diego Klattenhoff) after a speech to a graduating class of troops. The conversation turns to Brody and his family. Brody turns hostile and sarcastically thanks Mike for \\"being there\\" for his family and for his wife, strongly implying he knows about Mike's affair with Jessica. Brody later starts making veiled comments to Jessica (Morena Baccarin) implying the same. Carrie (Claire Danes) has one day left before the FISA warrant expires, and she still has no solid evidence against Brody. She asks Saul (Mandy Patinkin) for an extension on the warrant, but Saul says to focus on the money trail instead and that the surveillance equipment in Brody's house must be removed the first chance she gets. The next day while the Brodys are at church, Carrie, Virgil (David Marciano), and Max (Maury Sterling) enter their house and remove all the cameras and microphones. Carrie takes the opportunity to search Brody's house, finding his Good Conduct Medal, and the garage, which had no cameras. She searches the entirety of the garage finding only the mat Brody uses for salat and the dish he uses for ritual purification before prayers. She thinks nothing of the two. At Langley, Carrie delivers a briefing where she explains that nine hours after Lynne's death, Latif Bin Walid was seen at a laundromat which is also a known front for a Hawala location. Since then, they have security camera footage of 51 customers entering the laundromat, any of whom could be the recipient of the money transfer via the sold necklace. Their job is to investigate those 51 people. Raqim Faisel (Omid Abtahi), the man who bought the house near the airport along with Aileen Morgan (Marin Ireland), is on the list. Carrie eventually turns her attention to Raqim when it is learned that he made three recent trips to Pakistan. Carrie, along with analyst Danny Galvez (Hrach Titizian), start looking into his past and agree to surveil him the next day. Carrie and Danny follow Raqim as he heads home from work. Aileen is home and receives a call from an unknown source saying \\"tell him traffic is bad on the Beltway.\\" Aileen immediately runs upstairs and posts an American flag in the window, which is a signal to Raqim to steer clear of the house. Raqim spots the flag and keeps driving. Carrie and Danny continue to follow him for a while, come up empty, and eventually take him off the list of suspects. The Brodys are hosting a party at their house. Gunshots are heard in the backyard. Everyone runs outside to find that Brody has killed a deer that had wandered into their yard, much to everyone's shock, especially his son Chris (Jackson Pace) who previously had taken a liking to the deer. Jessica finally unloads all her frustrations on Brody, taking him to task for his carelessly using a weapon and terrifying their children, along with his sexual dysfunctions and overall disturbing behavior since his return. She demands that he seek some kind of counseling. The next night, Brody tells a relieved Jessica that he has decided to go to a veteran's support group meeting. Carrie, after losing her camera feeds, has resorted to staking out Brody's house; she follows him to the meeting. She walks into the meeting and pretends to bump into him. Brody recognizes her from the CIA debriefing. Carrie acts embarrassed and says she is not supposed to be there. She leaves, but Brody follows her outside. The two have a brief, flirtatious conversation. They form a connection over their mutual wartime experience in the Middle East, and lament how hard it is to talk about with people who were not there. Production Series developers and executive producers Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa co-wrote the episode, and Jeffrey Nachmanoff directed. Reception Ratings The original broadcast had 1.1 million viewers which exceeded the rating of the pilot episode. Reviews Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, and praised the new story arcs and the fleshing out of some of the secondary characters.

He arrived with his family in Wellington from London via Nelson on 3 January 1843 on the Prince of Wales. He travelled with his wife, their two sons Walter Woods and Sydney and their daughter Agnes Mary who was born during the journey. He was a Freemason and of Presbyterian faith, but his children were brought up in their mother's Catholic faith.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History The Provincial Tramways Company was floated in July 1872 by means of a prospectus inviting public subscription for shares in a new company.'The Times (London, England), Tuesday, 16 July 1872; pg. 13; Issue 27430. The published prospectus stated an intention to set up horse tramway companies in various towns including Cardiff. Within a year those in Plymouth and Cardiff were in operation as reported to the half yearly meeting of the company in 1873.The Morning Post (London, England), Thursday, 3 April 1873; pg. 7; Issue 31437. Cardiff Tramways Company was a wholly owned subsidiary company of The Provincial Tramways Company and its first horse tramways were in operation by July 1872 from High Street in the city center to the Docks, and eventually 6 miles of route were operated. On 10 December 1877, the Council approved the operation of services on Christmas Day, subject to some improvements in the operation of the service in general and to the removal of the smell arising from the bad oil used in lighting the cars.'Council Minutes: 1876-80', Cardiff Records: volume 4 (1903), pp. 493-514 In 1887 after a protracted trading war with the horse bus operations of Solomon Andrews in Cardiff, Plymouth and Portsmouth a settlement was reached whereby The Provincial Tramways Company bought the operations of Solomon Andrews in those towns, full details of the settlement were reported at the companies 30th AGM.Western Mail (Cardiff, Wales), Wednesday, 30 November 1887; Issue 5785 1889 was a year marked by several industrial disputes between the tramway company and its staff reaching a climax at the end of June with serious disorder on the streets as strikers successfully stopped the trams operating.Western Mail (Cardiff, Wales), Monday, 1 July 1889; Issue 6278 In 1898, Cardiff County Borough Council obtained Parliamentary powers to take over all the tramways in the area and go ahead with the new electric trams, owning them from 1902, under the revised name Cardiff Corporation Tramways. The company was operating 52 horse tramcars at the beginning of 1902 when most of the tramways was purchased by the council.The Provincial Press, No14 September 2006 From 1902 the Cardiff Tramways Company continued to operate its horse buses in Cardiff until 1908, from 1907 it had started to operate motor buses and gradually developed a motor bus fleet of various types.

Later that year another route was opened from the High Street eastwards via The Hayes and Queen Street to Roath later in 1879 extended a further half mile eastwards. Also in 1879 a route westwards from the High Street to Canton was constructed. Another route was built from the High Street southwards to Clarence Road terminating near to the Pier Head line and finally a route was opened from the High Street north to Cathays via Salisbury Road.

It is part of the Peruvian segment of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the three volcanic belts of the Andes generated by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate. Peru's active volcanoes Ubinas, Sabancaya and El Misti are also part of the Central Volcanic Zone. Yucamane, together with the volcanoes Yucamane Chico and Calientes farther north, forms a Pleistocene volcanic group. Yucamane is constructed mainly by lava flows with subordinate pyroclastic deposits, and it has a well preserved summit crater with fumarolic activity. The volcanic group was active in the Pleistocene epoch, with several explosive eruptions occurring during the Holocene epoch at Yucamane proper. The last dated eruption of Yucamane occurred 1,320 BCE; whether there were historical eruptions is unclear as some eruptions attributed to Yucamane probably took place at Tutupaca.  Geography and geomorphology  Yucamane lies in the Tacna Region, Candarave Province, Candarave District of Peru, west of lake Vilacota. The town of Candarave lies southwest from the volcano and the city of Tacna south. A number of mostly agricultural towns exist on its slopes, such as Aricota, Cairani, Camilaca, Cucachi, Huanuara, Morjani, Pallata, Susapaya, Tarata, Ticaco, Totora and Yucamane Pampa, as well as irrigation infrastructure and major roads. Sulfur was mined on the volcano in the past. The area of Yucamane is accessible by a number of roads including the international Ilo-Desaguadero highway, and a road leads up the northwestern flank of Yucamane to a point close to the mountain pass between Yucamane and Calientes. The edifice of the volcano and surrounding region are part of the Vilacota-Maure protected area.  Regional  The Andes are the longest mountain range on Earth, extending from the Tierra del Fuego archipelago in southernmost South America to Venezuela in the north. In southern Peru, the Andes consist of several mountain chains including the Western Cordillera and the Eastern Cordillera, with elevations of up to , which are separated from each other by the Altiplano. More than 2,000 volcanoes exist in the Andes, mainly in the countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Among these is Nevado del Ruiz, which erupted in 1985 in Colombia. Seven volcanoes have been active in Peru since the arrival of the Spaniards, but volcanic activity is typically poorly recorded in Peru, owing to the remote nature of the region and the scarce population. Yucamane is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the three major volcanic belts in the Andes, which spans the countries of Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. In Peru about four hundred heavily eroded volcanoes make up the volcanically active area along with the active volcanoes El Misti, Sabancaya and Ubinas; the volcanoes Andagua volcanic field, Casiri, Chachani, Coropuna, Firura, Huaynaputina, Tutupaca and Yucamane may have been active in recent history. The largest historical eruption in Peru occurred in 1600 at Huaynaputina and caused 1,500 fatalities and severe economic damage. Another major eruption occurred 2,000 years before present at El Misti volcano. Finally, the three volcanoes Ampato, Chachani and Coropuna have heights exceeding .  Local  Yucamane is a mountain whose height is variously given as , or . It is a high compound volcano, with an about wide summit crater; this depression in turn has a smaller crater with a diameter of nested within. The summit crater has a young appearance, and due to the youth of the volcano there is little trace of glaciation. Yucamane has a conical shape and is formed primarily by lava flows with some block and ash flows and pyroclastic flows. Lava flows are thick and often show characteristic flow ridges. They are especially prevalent on the upper western and upper southern flanks of the volcano, while the eastern flank has a higher proportion of pyroclastic flows, as does the far southern flank. Based on slope angle, a \\"Yucamane I\\" volcano, which forms the lower part of the volcano and has a more gentle slope, has been distinguished from a \\"Yucamane II\\", which sits atop \\"Yucamane I\\" and has steeper slopes. On the southeastern flank a secondary volcanic centre, high Mal Paso, can be found. This cone is wide and has a partially destroyed crater. Several other volcanoes lie north of Yucamane, such as the or high Yucamane Chico and the or high Calientes, which form a long north-south volcanic chain with Yucamane. Other volcanoes in the area include San Pedro and the much older Nazaparco. Nazaparco consists of andesitic rocks and rhyolitic block and ash flows, while Yucamane Chico and Calientes are surrounded by radially extending lava flows like Yucamane proper. Calientes have a degraded summit crater. These older volcanoes are eroded and show evidence of sector collapses and glaciation, which has left moraines at elevations of about . This volcanic complex is part of the Cordillera del Barroso mountain chain in southern Peru. The Yucamane fault runs in a north-south direction across the volcanoes, and another fault that runs northwest-southeast is named the Yucamane Chico fault; the Yucamane Chico volcano roughly coincides with the intersection of these faults.  Hydrology  The slopes of the volcano drain westward, eastward and southward towards the Calientes and Callazas rivers in the east and west of Yucamane, respectively. Both rivers flow southward and ultimately join to form the Locumba river, which ends in the Pacific Ocean. The water in these rivers contains large quantities of arsenic derived from volcanic rocks, including Yucamane's volcanic rocks; arsenic in drinking water is linked to internal organ damage and cancer.  Geology  Off the western coast of South America, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate at a rate of about . This subduction process is responsible for the volcanic activity in the Andes. The subducting slab releases fluids which induce the formation of melts which are then erupted on the surface as volcanism. The subduction process is not uniform along the plate margin; variations in the dip of the subducting Nazca plate occur along its length, and volcanic activity is concentrated in three belts (Northern Volcanic Zone, Central Volcanic Zone and Southern Volcanic Zone) where the angle of subduction is steep enough. Volcanism in the region has been active since the Jurassic, with remnants of the oldest volcanic arc recognizable in the Peruvian Coastal Cordillera. During the Miocene epoch, volcanic activity occurred along the entire length of Peru; Pliocene- Pleistocene activity on the other hand is confined to southern Peru as part of the Central Volcanic Zone, with volcanic centres concentrated in the Western Cordillera. Volcanoes in Peru were first catalogued in 1962 and 1966, with a major compilation being published in 1991 by De Silva and Francis. These volcanoes include composite volcanoes, ignimbrites, lava domes and lava flow fields. Yucamane is constructed on a basement formed by the Paleozoic Tacaza Group (lavas of the lower Tacaza formation), the Jurassic Yura Group (sediments of the Hualhuani formation) and the Neogene volcanic Huaylillas formation; parts of this basement crop out on the southern side of Yucamane. This basement in turn consists of two major tectonic blocks, the southern Arequipa terrane and the northern Paracas massif; both are formed by igneous and metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and are covered by Mesozoic sedimentary and Cenozoic volcanic rocks.  Petrology  Yucamane has erupted andesite, basaltic andesite, trachyandesite and dacite, which define a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. The andesites make up the bulk of the outcropping edifice. These andesitic rocks contain phenocrysts of amphibole, biotite, hornblende, oxides, plagioclase and quartz.  Climate and natural features  The region has a dry tropical climate, with precipitation on Yucamane amounting to about . Most of it falls during the summer months, and the amount of precipitation decreases southwestward towards the coast and away from the mountains. After precipitation events the mountain is sometimes covered with snow. Average temperatures in the region vary between throughout the year. Vegetation around the volcano includes a humid tundra with overall low vegetation density on its upper slopes, and paramo and montane steppe vegetation east/west and south of the volcano on its lower slopes, respectively. Quenoa woods have been observed on its flanks, which are otherwise covered by pastures lower on the volcano. The scorpion species Brachistosternus ninapo is named after the volcano; the term ninapo is a portmanteau of the Quechua word for \\"fire-spitting mountain\\". This scorpion was discovered on the sides of the volcanoes Yucamane and El Misti.  Eruptive history  Yucamane Chico and Calientes are of possibly pre- Pleistocene epoch age while Yucamane is younger. The activity of Calientes and Yucamane, however, overlapped in time, and both have generated lava flows which lie above moraines. Nazaparco was dated to 6.23 ¬± 0.1 million years ago, while dates of 540,000 ¬± 270,000 and 126,000 ¬± 3,000 before present on an older stage are reported for Caliente. Yucamane itself has lava flows dated at 380,000 ¬± 300,000, 23,000 ¬± 1,000 and 3,000 ¬± 2,000 years before present. Tephrochronology has shown the occurrence of an eruption 44,000 ¬± 2,130/2,910 years ago; another one occurred 36,450 ¬± 250 years ago and generated a lateral blast. Yet another event occurred 3,270 ¬± 50/3,085 ¬± 35 years before present; during the course of this eruption Yucamane expelled at least of material in the form of pumice, lapilli and tephra. This eruption had a volcanic explosivity index of 5; fallout deposits reached the Quelccaya Ice Cap and influenced the chemistry of lakes close to the ice cap. Activity during the late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs was mainly explosive with Vulcanian eruptions and phreatomagmatic eruptions among others, which generated volcanic ash falls, block and ash flows, pyroclastic flows and pyroclastic surges. In total, about 4-5 explosive eruptions occurred in post-glacial time and left tephra deposits over the southern and southeastern flanks of the edifice.  Historical activity  Eruptions reported in 1787, 1802, 1862 and 1902 in the region have also been attributed to Yucamane, although some may actually have occurred at Tutupaca. The 1787 and 1902 events involved the emission of ash; an 1874 edition of the Arequipa-based El Deber newspaper states that Yucamane was \\"bursting\\" and \\"steaming\\" in 1787. There does not appear to be any volcanic material more recent than the 3,270 ¬± 50/3,085 ¬± 35 eruption, however. Overall, historical records are fragmentary and scarce, and the Global Volcanism Program recognizes the 1,320 BCE eruption as the most recent event. Yucamane is fumarolically active in its summit crater, the fumaroles are most recognizable after precipitation and are not very intense. Presently, Yucamane is considered to be a dormant volcano. Thermal anomalies of about of uncertain origin have been observed on Yucamane by satellite imagery. The Caliente geothermal field east of Yucamane, which includes geysers and hot springs, appears to be unrelated to Yucamane.  Hazards  The Peruvian geological agency INGEMMET has published ash fall, lava flow and pyroclastic flow hazard maps for Yucamane, and additional hazard maps are available on its website. According to these the western, eastern and southern flanks could be threatened by lava flows, whereas the older volcanoes protect much of the northern flank. Hazards from pyroclastic flows extend farther, down to the Laguna Aricota lake southwest of the volcano. Hazards from lava flows derive from their ability to bury land and to ignite flammable materials, as well as the possible creation of lava dams on rivers and outburst floods when they break, while the high speed and temperatures of pyroclastic flows threatens people with asphyxiation, burial and burns. More than 9,000 people live in the danger zone. Ash fall from an eruption could extend southeastward to the border with Chile]and affect the towns of Candarave, Ilabaya, Pachia, Palca and Tarata. Volcanic earthquakes like the 1999 Ticsani earthquakes at a volcano farther north and volcanic gases constitute additional dangers.

The following year it defoliated Buxus colchica in large quantities.http://www.dendrarium.ru/news-dendrariy/160-2013-10-17-11-38-53 It was recorded in Ontario, Canada in August 2018.  Description  Eggs are 1 mm in diameter, located under green unattacked leaves. First larvae just coming out from the egg are about 1‚Äì2 mm long. Larvae development brings them in four weeks to about 35‚Äì40 mm at maximum. There is some shrinkage at the beginning of the nymphosis, pupae are 25‚Äì30 mm long, first green with browning longitudinal lines, then more and more brownish. The wingspan of the adult form is 40‚Äì45 mm. Two variants are observed, the most common one is mostly white while the other is most entirely light brown.  Life cycle  There are two or three generations per year with adults on the wing from April/May to September.. In the warmest parts of the European importation area, with cold conditions coming late in the year, there might be sometimes four generations per year. The species overwinters as a juvenile cocooned larva (about 5‚Äì10 mm long), protected in an hibernarium made of two leaving Buxus leaves solidly joined by silk.  Host plant  Larval feeding damage - only the contour of the leaves and frass is left. The larvae feed on the leaves and shoots of Buxus species.Invasive caterpillar 'could spread in UK' Young larvae only eat the upper part of the leaf, leaving the hardest inside structure. The leaves are not destroyed completely but appear as \\"peeled\\" in small parallel beats lines, or almost completely. These peeled leaves eventually die. Old larvae are the most damaging: they massively and completely eat the leaves, sometimes leaving a thin part at the contour and centre of the leaf, however. Green ball-shaped frass can usually be seen on host plants.  Natural regulation or predation  Vespa velutina (Asian predatory wasp) in active search of Cydalima perspectalis larvae on an infested box-tree bush. In the area of origin (Asia) natural regulation occurs, as witnessed by the non-destructive behavior of C. perspectalis. In the area of Europe where the moth has been introduced, the damage is very serious because natural regulation does not occur at a significant level. However, in European areas where the Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) is present prior to the introduction of C. perspectalis, some degree of predation by the wasp is observed (not confirmed by scientific and clear results). This is namely in the south-west of France, the first place where V. velutina was introduced to Europe in 2004 (C. perspectalis invaded this area in 2012). V. velutina is able to capture small larvae, and larvae preparing for the nymphosis in their cocoon. Where V. velutina has been introduced this causes other problems as it preys on honey bees and European honey bees are more vulnerable than their Asian counterparts. Further research is conducted for the suitability of C. perspectalis for parasitoid species, such as the tachinid Exorista larvarum. Control measures Synthetic insecticides such as cypermethrin and deltamethrin are efficient, but must be thoroughly applied inside the bush and under leaves. Natural pyrethrin insecticides, extracted from Chrysanthemum and mixed with colza oil, can also be used. Spinosad, based on chemical compounds found in a bacterium, is also efficient. Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. kurstaki is a bacterium which produces an insect-specific endotoxin which perforates the caterpillars' gut lining, leading to paralysis and death. Nematodes also have an action on the digestive system of larvae (difficult to adopt on this moth). Pheromone traps (attracting adult males) are able to prevent impregnation of adult females and therefore control the severity of the damage. A more important proportion of sterile eggs is deposited by adult females. The selectivity of the pheromone is very good and useful indigenous species are not attracted. Pheromone traps must be in place from March‚ÄìApril to October‚ÄìNovember. Insecticide, Bacillus and nematode treatments must be repeated three times at an interval of about ten days, because they mostly affect young larvae. The species has become widespread in London and surrounding areas and has been ranked the top garden pest in Great Britain. Royal Horticultural Society provides an on-line survey to keep track of the pest.

In the meantime Bharathan invents a gadget that could be used to clean and sweep the courtyard and also to pluck coconuts and fruits from palms and trees. One day, on the way to take classes, Bharathan notices a paper rocket-flown by some children-staying midair for an unusually long period of time. This and a few other experiences lead him to a very spectacular discovery relating to gravity. But people around him brand him a lunatic and that leads to many problems in his life. But Bharathan does discover the reason behind the phenomenon is antigravity and claims that he can make flying objects that can be used by man to reach any destination without any fuel, and he suddenly gets famous. But due to over concentration, Bharathan loses his memory about the project. The government brings a psychiatrist to cure him. He finds that with some seemingly fatal interventions, Bharathan could be cured and he could make antigravity workable.

Most of the reviewers criticised the lack of research in the screenplay and questioned the scientific accuracy of the film.

Plot In the year X-L-1-1-1 B.C., Julius Caesar (sounding a lot like Hercules Grytpype-Thynne) lands on the British shore and is greeted by Ecclus. Caesar asks his second-in-command, Brutus Moriartus, to seize Ecclus and prepare him for a life of slavery. The next \\"Charlie Britannicus\\" to come along is Neddie Seagoon. Caesar remarks \\"Gad, he's up early. He must be one of the Early Britons.\\" Moriartus finally has to explain that they're here to conquer Britain, and the natives must prepare themselves for \\"combattus\\", but they think he means a soccer game and arrive attired in blue jerseys and a football. For ten years Caesar rules with an iron hand‚Äîthen with a wooden foot, and finally with a piece of string.

With Bluebottlus and Ecclus, he is bought by a promoter for the Games. When he learns he is not scheduled to sing, but to be strangled by a gorilla, Seagoon conspires with his fellow prisoners to escape. They are met by Willium Hannibal and Little Jim, who lead them to the hideout of Sprartacus from Prortigal. Sprartacus turns out to be Bloodnok. He tells them they're perfectly safe because the hideout is inside the extinct volcano, Vesumruverus. The volcano promptly explodes, leaving Greenslade reminding listeners to tune in next week.

It is located in a small nature reserve that contains a number of rare plant species, on the high Tomberg hill. The Tomberg is a relic of the Tertiary. Liquid lava rose up in a volcano; erosion has since removed the outer layers and left a basalt dome.  History  The earliest traces of settlement on the Tomberg date to the 4th century and point to its use by the Romans. The hill castle was constructed around the year 900 and was expanded in later centuries. Around 1000, Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia and his wife Matilda, a sister of Emperor Otto III, resided at the Tomburg. Their daughter Richeza became Queen of Poland. Her brother Otto inherited the Palatinate. He became Duke of Swabia in 1045 and died at the Tomburg in 1047. Ownership changed to the Duke of Cleves in 1090 and to the Lords of M√ºllenark in 1230. From that point onwards, they called themselves von Tomburg. After a turbulent history, the castle lost its military importance beginning from the 14th century, due to the introduction of black powder in the artillery. It was still used as a fall-back position by the von Tomburgs who by that time acted as mere robber barons, like many former noble families during the decline of the Middle Ages. After an inheritance division in 1420, the castle had several owners. It was conquered by Duke Gerhard VII of J√ºlich after a fight with Frederick of Tomburg and Landskron. It was almost totally destroyed by shellfire on 7 September 1473 and never rebuilt.  Current situation  Until modern times, the castle ruins and Tomberg hill were used as a basalt quarry. Nevertheless, about 70% of the hill and some elements of the castle's bergfried have been preserved. The 46-metre-deep castle well still exists; it was excavated in 1883 by a local society. Many archeological finds were made, such as stone cannon balls. A stylized Tomberg is depicted on the packaging of the sugar beet syrup produced by a factory in nearby Meckenheim. A Bundeswehr barracks in Rheinbach was named after the Tomburg, as was a local secondary school.

The name of the novel is a reference to the John Steinbeck novella Of Mice and Men. Plot Protagonist Dan Starkey is tasked with writing a book about \\"Bobby Fat Boy McMaster\\", the current heavyweight champion of Ireland, in his upcoming championship fight with Mike Tyson on St. Patrick's Day. When McMaster's wife is kidnapped, Starkey must figure out who's behind it before the varied and numerous factions that McMaster has offended, in his short time in New York, catch up with them. Reception The novel received generally positive acclaim, with reviewers praising the novels humour while noting that it is not of the same quality as the previous Starkey novel, Divorcing Jack. Publishers Weekly stated that the novel is \\"not as tight and focused as Bateman's previous work\\" and notes that the novel \\"reflects a distinct political and religious bias, which will surprise readers who appreciated Starkey's earlier, more tongue-in-cheek approach to Northern Ireland sectarianism\\". They did, however, also state that: \\"nevertheless, Bateman delivers the kind of humour and sense of the ridiculous that his fans will relish\\". Kirkus Reviews took a similar stance, stating that the novel is \\"more relaxed and less wildly funny than Divorcing Jack or Cycle of Violence ‚Äî but then that's what you'd expect when the brutality is only a game\\".

Perret on 16 October 1909 Frank Alvord Perret (2 August 1867 in Hartford, Connecticut - January 12, 1943 in New York City) was an American entrepreneur, inventor, and volcanologist, who was particularly well known for his studies of eruptions of Vesuvius, Kilauea and Mount Pel√©e. He studied physics at Polytechnic Institute of New York University and was then employed in the laboratories of Thomas Edison in the Lower East Side, where he worked on the development of engines and dynamos. In 1886, he founded the Elektron Manufacturing Company, together with John A. Barrett, a small company that designed and produced electronic devices. Frank A. Perret became involved in the development of the theory of EMF (s:.Counter-electromotive force, CEMF), and invented the Perret electric motor. In 1889, Perret appointed Elihu H. Cutler to oversee the expansion of the company, and with it a new factory in Springfield in Massachusetts. Among other things, Perret's company built elevators, and was later acquired in 1906 by the Otis Elevator Company. In 1902, Perret fell ill having suffered 'nervous prostration caused by overwork' https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/volcano-watch-who-frank-alvord-perret-and- what-his-connection-hawaiian-volcanoes. Accessed 20 June 2020. In 1903, Perret went to Italy to recuperate, and it was there in Naples, that he had his first encounter with Vesuvius. He soon made the acquaintance of the Director of the Vesuvius Volcano Observatory, Prof. Raffaele V. Matteucci, and by 1906 had become Prof. Matteucci's honorary assistant at the Observatory. During April 1906, Perret and Matteucci observed a major eruption of Vesuvius, during which Perret took numerous photographs and made many observations of eruptive phenomena, including St Elmo's Fire. Perret eventually published a major monograph on this eruption in 1924F A Perret, The Vesuvius eruption of 1906, Carnegie Inst., Washington https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Vesuvius_Eruption_of_1906.html?id=x_EUAAAAIAAJ&redir;_esc=y. In her obituary of PerretGiblin, Frank Alvord Perret (1867 ‚Äì 1943), Bulletin Volcanologique, 10, 191‚Äì196(1950), https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02596088, Mildred Giblin wrote that Perret's monograph on the Vesuvius was \\"the clearest and most comprehensive report ever on a volcanic eruption and its aftermath published\\". By the end of the first decade of the 20th century Perret had also visited the volcanoes of Kilauea, Stromboli, Etna, Mount Teide and Sakurajima. In 1909 Perret suggested to the geophysicists Thomas Jaggar from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Reginald A. Daly of Harvard University to establish a continuous monitoring station at Kilauea. Perret spent four months on Kilauea in 1911, where he began to make the first long-term observations of activity from the edge of the crater Halema ªuma ªu. The station was the forerunner of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, which was built by Thomas Jaggar the following year. When Mount Pel√©e on the French Caribbean island of Martinique became active again in 1929, some years after the devastating eruption of 1902 Perret was one of the first scientists on site. During the three years of volcanic activity, from 1929-1932, he conducted numerous investigations and in 1931 he built a small observation hut on the Morne Lenard above the valley of the Riviere Blanch as the first permanent station on the mountain. Perret published a monograph on the Pelee eruptions in 1936. During his extended stay on Martinique, Perret raised funds to establish a volcanological museum in St Pierre, to 'tell the story of the Modern Pompeii'. The founders of this enterprise included a local rum merchant, Victor Depaz, and philanthropists Vincent Astor, William L Mellon and George F Baker. The Mus√©e Franck A.

Life Shaw was born in Ravensworth in the North Riding of Yorkshire; his father Cuthbert Shaw was a shoemaker. He attended the local grammar school at Kirby Hill where he paid his way by serving as an usher. He then was usher at then at Darlington grammar school. Shaw joined a company of actors in the eastern counties. In 1760, under the name of Smith, he appeared in Samuel Foote's comedy of The Minor, relying on his good looks, which were prematurely dulled by his excesses. On 19 October 1761 he was Osman in Zara at Covent Garden, and on 14 May 1762 Pierre in Venice Preserv'd, for his own benefit. This seems to have been his last appearance on the stage. Shaw puffed a quack medicine, the Beaume de Vie, in which he was made a partner. He married, and was next, for a short time, tutor to the young Philip Stanhope in succession to the notorious William Dodd. His young wife died in 1768. He himself died, amid many troubles, at his house in Titchfield Street, Oxford Market, on 1 September 1771. Works Shaw published his first poem, Liberty, inscribed to the Earl of Darlington (1756). In 1760 at Bury St. Edmunds he published, under the pseudonym of W. Seymour, Odes on the Four Seasons. Shaw made a verbal assault on the satirist Charles Churchill, by whose work he was influenced, with Robert Lloyd, George Colman and William Shirley, in The Four Farthing Candles (London, 1762). It was followed by The Race. By Mercurius Spur, esq. (1766), in which living poets contend for pre-eminence in fame by running, with a portrait of Samuel Johnson (republished in The Repository, 1790, ii. 227; and quoted in James Boswell's Life of Johnson). He published a Monody to the Memory of a Young Lady who died in Childbed, with a poetical dedication to Lord Lyttelton, (1768) after his wife's death. It caught the taste of the day, and of which a fourth edition appeared (London, 1779). Next year he found utterance in Corruption, a Satire, inscribed to Richard Grenville, Earl Temple, and subsequently (1770) in An Elegy on the Death of Charles Yorke, the Lord Chancellor, which was generally tho thought have been suppressed by the family making a payment to the author. During the final years of his life Shaw contributed to The Freeholder's Magazine and other periodicals, with caustic comments on persons and current events. A selection of his work was printed in Robert Anderson's British Poets (1794, xi. 557), and in Thomas Park's British Poets (1808, xxxiii.), Charles Whittingham's British Poets (1822, lxiv. 47, with memoir by Richard Alfred Davenport), and Ezekiel Sandford's British Poets (1822, xxxi. 233).

It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the program, particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user is disconnected.  Features  A terminal multiplexer can be thought of as a text version of graphical window managers, or as a way of putting attach virtual terminals to any login session. It is a wrapper that allows multiple text programs to run at the same time, and provides features that allow the user to use the programs within a single interface productively. ; Persistence: Similar to VNC, many terminal multiplexers allow the user to start applications from one computer, and then reconnect from a different computer and continue using the same application without having to restart it. This makes accessing the same session between different locations like work and home simple. These multiplexers generally provide terminal-agnostic functionality so that users can disconnect and reconnect using different terminal types, allowing applications to continue running without being aware of the change in terminals. :Concretely, the multiplexer starts a session (with associated processes), and then either does not attach a terminal to it, or attaches a terminal but can subsequently detach it (for example if the network connection is dropped). Since the session does not end, the processes are not sent a \\"hangup\\" signal (SIGHUP) and are not terminated, so they continue running, and one can subsequently (re)attach a terminal to the session and continue interacting, or simply leave the session unattached. ; Multiple windows: Multiple terminal sessions can be created, each of which usually runs a single application. The windows are numbered, and the user can use the keyboard to switch between them. Some GUI terminal emulators provide tabs or otherwise similar functionality to this. Each window has its own scroll-back buffer, so that output is captured even when the window isn't actively displayed, and that history can be saved even when migrating to another computer. Windows can be split-screened. While some text applications have this functionality built in, a terminal multiplexer allows any application to be split-screened alongside any number of other applications. ; Session Sharing: Terminal multiplexers allow multiple computers to connect to the same session at once, enabling collaboration between multiple users. The same computer can also be used to make multiple simultaneous connections, providing alternative functionality to screen-splitting, particularly for computers with multiple monitors.  Implementations  * Byobu: A profile and configuration utility for GNU Screen and tmux. * dvtm: Tiling window management for the console. * GNU Screen: the prototypical terminal multiplexer, first released in 1987 * mtm: billed as \\"perhaps the smallest useful terminal multiplexer in the world\\" *neercs: neercs (\\"screen\\" spelled backwards) is a GNU screen workalike. It supports window thumbnailing and graphical animated screensavers. It also supports 3D console switching (switching between consoles mapped to the faces of a cube) via the libcaca ASCII art library. * splitvt: split terminal utility. * TD/SMP: introduced by DEC on their VT330/340 terminals, TD/SMP was proprietary and only widely supported by their own terminal servers * tmux: A modern GNU Screen workalike, released in 2007; it is BSD-licensed, allows multiple panes (with optional Xterm mouse support), and has a scriptable command interface. tmux aimed to allow the sharing of a single window between multiple terminals, while keeping the other windows in the same session entirely separate. tmux has been part of the OpenBSD base system since 2009's version 4.6. * Twin (\\"Text mode WINdow environment\\"): a full-fledged window manager for text windows.

He was Governor of the Gulf Province from 2007 to 2017 as a member of the People's National Congress. He briefly lost office in 2010 following a June attempt by opponents in the provincial assembly to oust him; the National Court recognised Pitom Bombom as interim governor in July before reinstating Kavo in August. Professional career and election to parliament Kavo was educated at Murua Primary School and Malalaua High School. He trained as a laboratory technician for two years in Rabaul before returning to work at Kerema Provincial Hospital. He won two scholarships to study internationally: in 1989 to study genetics in New Zealand and in 1994 to study microbiology in Melbourne, Australia. He subsequently studied medicine at the University of Papua New Guinea, where he was president of the medical students' association. He graduated in 1994 and returned to Gulf Province, working as a pathologist at Kerema. He was the unsuccessful PNC candidate for Gulf Governor at the 2002 election, having become frustrated at the poor facilities around him in his health work. Following his defeat, he became the provincial overseer for the Christian Life Church and a chicken and vegetable farmer. Kavo won the Gulf governorship at his second attempt at the 2007 election. He pledged to achieve improved development in Gulf Province and to gain more benefit for residents from oil and gas projects in the province. In January 2009, he sought to have K51 million of the K220 funding for major projects in his province paid to the Gulf Engineering and Construction company, of which he was the sole director. In May 2009, the landowners of Kikori approved Kavo as their representative in negotiations around their equity participation in liquefied natural gas projects. He refused to sign the Benefit Sharing Agreement for PNG Gas that year after the rejection of several proposals for benefit sharing in Gulf Province, and suggested that the pipeline should be diverted around Gulf Province if benefit for its residents were not provided. In December 2009, he won a long-running court battle over his suspension of provincial administrator Miai Larelake. In March 2010, he announced that the provincial government would sue ExxonMobil over environmental concerns relating to the LNG project; however, it was dismissed in June. Power struggle and first misappropriation arrest In June 2010, the Gulf Provincial Assembly sought to oust Kavo with a vote of no-confidence, raising concerns about his refusal to swear in LLG presidents, failure to conduct meetings and to provide opportunities for budget debate, failure to comply with a number of formal processes and allegations that he had made a number of controversial payments to himself. The motion was successful, but Kavo disputed the outcome and filed a court challenge, claiming that his removal, as well as the meeting it occurred at, was illegal. The National Court initially in July refused Kavo's request for an injunction and held his opponent, MP Pitom Bombom, to be the interim governor. However, in August, the Supreme Court reinstated Kavo as interim governor pending a final resolution of the dispute. A vocal dispute with Bombom and Mark Maipaikai continued throughout the term, although Kavo was eventually confirmed as governor in September 2011. In April 2011, Kavo was arrested and charged for the alleged misappropriation of over PGK131,000 in public funds from the Gulf administration between January and February 2010. The payments were authorised by then acting Gulf provincial administrator, Simon Peter who was also arrested for his alleged role. Kavo claimed that there had been political interference, citing his rival Maipaikai's position as Minister for Internal Security; when Peter died following his arrest, Kavo claimed that the police had been responsible for the death. Kavo subsequently claimed there was a plot to re-arrest him on the same charges if he were cleared by the committal court, and that the provincial police commander had been heard making statements to that effect. He was subsequently acquitted by the committal court. Second term Kavo was re-elected at the 2012 election. In October 2012, the misappropriation allegations re-emerged when the Office of the Public Prosecutor referred the matter for trial as an ex-officio indictment, despite their failure to win a committal the previous year. In December 2012, the provincial assembly called for Kavo to return to the province and operate from Kerema rather than his office in Port Moresby. In the same month, Kavo signed a deal to develop the Pala Inlet Port Project, providing a deepwater point in East Kikori. In August 2013, as discussions around the Elk and Antelope gas fields at Baimuru progressed, Kavo insisted that all gas resources from the fields must be processed in the province. In November 2013, he officiated at launching ceremonies for a water supply scheme for Kerema township and a major upgrade for Kerema High School. In December, he witnessed the signing of a partnership between Total S.A. and InterOil to develop the Elk-Antelope gas fields. Kavo's misappropriation trial began in April 2014. In September, he was found guilty of misappropriating K131,338 from a trust fund belonging to Gulf Province, with Deputy Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika holding that Kavo's application of the funds for personal use had been \\"dishonest\\". He was sentenced to three years in jail in December 2014, with eighteen months suspended due to Kavo having repaid the money. He appealed and was released on bail, while landowners expressed concerns about missing out on promised benefits due to his jailing. Several politicians called for him to step down pending his appeal and Attorney-General Ano Pala wrote that he could not perform the duties of governor, suggesting the provincial assembly appoint an interim governor, while Kavo insisted that he remained the validly-elected Governor. In June 2015, Kavo was again arrested while on bail and charged with misappropriating K783,195 in separate proceedings to those he was already on bail for. In August 2015, he won his Supreme Court appeal, which quashed the September 2014 conviction. In February 2016, Kavo called for the national government to honour its commitments regarding local benefits from the PNG Gas project, including the Piam Inlet Port, completion of the Gulf-Southern Highlands Highway and the construction of ten satellite towns, claiming that nine years and passed and his \\"people were still waiting\\". In April 2016, he was committed for trial in the National Court over the June 2015 misappropriation charges. In November 2016, Kavo raised concerns about reports that ExxonMobil wished to purchase InterOil shares, raising fears of an LNG monopoly in Papua New Guinea. He lost his seat at the 2017 election to former Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta, who he had defeated when he won the governorship in 2007.

Description The line links Eglisau in the Swiss canton of Zurich with the city of Schaffhausen in the Swiss canton of Schaffhausen, crossing some of the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in between. It thus crosses the Germany‚ÄìSwitzerland border twice. The line is long, standard gauge and electrified at supplied by overhead line. The section between H√ºntwangen- Wil and Rafz is double track, whilst the rest of the line is single track. Schaffhausen was first connected to the Swiss railway system in 1857 with the opening of the Rheinfall Railway. Whilst this line was entirely on Swiss soil, and provided a direct link to the city of Winterthur, it only provided a rather indirect route to the rest of Switzerland and the Gotthard Railway. The Swiss Northeastern Railway therefore constructed the Eglisau to Neuhausen line, which opened in 1897. The construction of the line involved the building of several civil engineering structures, including the Eglisau railway bridge across the Rhine at the southern end of the line. At the northern end of the line, two tunnels were necessary, with lengths of and . The whole line, including the section in Germany, now belongs to the Swiss Federal Railways, and is subject to Swiss rail regulations and Swiss domestic rail fares. Besides the junction stations of Eglisau and Neuhausen, there are five intermediate stations, of which three are in Switzerland and two in Germany. A sixth intermediate station, at Altenburg-Rheinau, was closed in 2011, whilst the Neuhausen Rheinfall station was opened in 2015. The line carries an hourly service of long-distance passenger trains between Zurich and Schaffhausen, with some trains operating as far as Frankfurt and Bern. Trains on the Zurich S-Bahn line S9 operate half-hourly from Zurich as far as Rafz (just before the German border), with alternate trains continuing to Schaffhausen. Schaffhausen S-Bahn line S22 provides a local service from Jestetten to Schaffhausen. Freight trains also use the line between Germany and the Gotthard route.

She was particularly popular in Australia in the 1910s and 1920s. She appeared in one film, Within the Law (1916), an adaptation of her stage success. She was also known for the plays East of Suez, Birds of Paradise and Madame X.  Australia  Starr was a favorite of Australian audiences, and at one time considered settling there. In 1913‚Äì1915 she toured Within the Law for J. C. Williamson, followed by Mid-Channel, Madame X, The Yellow Ticket, Bought and Paid For, Under Cover and The Law of the Land in which she could play strong emotion. She was less successful in comedies The Chorus Lady and especially Sunday She returned in December 1917 for Hugh J. Ward with Richard Walton Tully's The Bird of Paradise, followed by The Easiest Way, The Man Who Came Back, Nobody's Widow, The Great Divide, Common Clay, Silent Witness and her famous pieces Within the Law and Bought and Paid For. A cousin, Norma Mitchell, accompanied her, and played support roles. Her male lead, Louis Kimball (1889‚Äì1936), received good notices. Before leaving, she married W. Hartwell Johnston at the Registry Office in Sydney. Her cousin and mother, Mrs O'Loughlin, also cited as Mrs Hughie MacIver, were present at the ceremony. Mr Johnston was managing director of the Wrigley Company in Australia. Her third season in Australia began in April 1924 and brought new plays: Robert Hichens' The Garden of Allah, East of Suez, The Pelican, The Skin Game, and Secrets, and revivals of Silent Witness, Bought and Paid For, and Madame X, possibly her greatest role. In Melbourne she tried a revival of The Silver King when Within the Law failed to draw the usual crowds. While in Sydney she swerved her car onto the wrong side of the road to avoid a stationary vehicle, mounting the footpath and crushing a pedestrian, causing serious injuries. She was charged with dangerous driving but found not guilty. Her farewell performances in regional centres included French Leave, The Sign on the Door, and Outcast In 1927 she reprised a string of her starring roles at the Palace Theatre, Sydney, and momentarily saved it from conversion to a movie theatre. Harvey Adams, her leading man in many plays from 1925, now also serving as producer. New plays included The House of Glass, Cornered; Robert H. McLaughlin's The Eternal Magdalene, The Goldfish, The Donovan Affair, Whispering Wires, The Last Warning, Nice People, Sweeney Todd, The Hole in the Wall and Shooting Shadows. This last was reviewed scathingly in Adelaide and not attempted elsewhere. In May 1930 she declared herself bankrupt, owing ¬£3,427 (perhaps a million dollars in today's money), mostly to J. C. Williamson. The judge granted her an unconditional discharge, on the grounds that her creditors knew the risks inherent in show business, and so she was able legally to return to America.

In an interview, Nichtern stated: \\"Her and her new manager came in and said, 'We want to get this off the market. We‚Äôre going for a completely new deal. We‚Äôll buy you out of the deal'.

Lizzy was crying and her Gramma has such a sweet smile on her face, in the sun at the beach. \\"I don't want to think I'm bad, Gramma, just for feelin' pretty...\\".  Release  Del Rey and producer David Kahne recorded 13 tracks for the album in 2008. Instead of releasing the material, her label put out the EP Kill Kill on October 21, 2008 under the name Lizzy Grant. The standard album was digitally released on January 24, 2010 but pulled three months after. A small number of promo CDs were pressed but the album never saw a physical release.

It first aired on CBS in the United States on February 8, 2011. The episode is written by Gary Glasberg and directed by James Whitmore, Jr., and was seen by 20.35 million viewers. In the episode, a naval commander is found dead in his rack aboard ship, apparently murdered. The NCIS team investigates while having to deal with mandatory psychological evaluations conducted by Dr. Rachel Cranston, who is eventually revealed to be the elder sister of their late colleague and friend, Agent Caitlin Todd. The title refers to the first line of the \\"bar joke\\". Plot The episode begins with the death of Navy Commander Vincent Reynolds, resulting in an investigation led by Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs' team. While working on the case, a mandatory psychological evaluation is conducted on each team member by Dr. Rachel Cranston. Ziva identifies the shell casing as one used mostly by Koreans and Russians, leading the investigation to a South Korean journalist aboard the vessel named Min Ho Kwon. The Commander's best friend, Navy Admiral Wayne Hargrove, is notified about the death, and he says he and his wife were like a family to Commander Reynolds. Interrogated by Gibbs and DiNozzo, Kwon reveals he's a spy from North Korea taking pictures of the weapon system on the vessel. The timestamps on the pictures confirm his innocence. While the team struggles to find a motive for the death of the Commander, Abby gets a match on the weapon using the shell casing found at the crime scene, a Russian TT-30. Only one owner of the pistol is connected to Commander Reynolds; Navy Seaman Marcus Leonard. McGee visits Leonard, but the pistol is missing from Leonard's collection, supposedly given to a friend. Commander Reynolds' brother, Peter Reynolds, informs McGee about a long-term relationship with a married woman named Nancy. Gibbs then contact Admiral Hargrove's wife, Nancy, about Commander Reynolds. She confirms the relationship. Abby only finds Commander Reynolds' DNA on the evidence, which makes Gibbs believe Reynolds' death wasn't a murder. The two sailors who reported the death are interrogated by DiNozzo and Gibbs, and reveal that they made the suicide look like a murder in order to protect Commander Reynolds' honor. The Commander killed himself because he was about to lose everything he cared about. During the investigation, Dr. Cranston talks to each team member about their personal and professional lives, going through different moments in their histories. Ziva expresses a yearning for stability in her life, saying, \\"I want something permanent. Something that can't be taken away. Is that too much to ask?\\" McGee is dismayed at his lack of success with relationships, while Abby states that she misses the deceased NCIS Special Agent Caitlin \\"Kate\\" Todd. DiNozzo admits to being afraid of living his life with nothing but his career. It's later revealed that Dr. Cranston is Kate's elder sister. In an effort to help her find closure, Gibbs tells her that Ziva had fatally shot her own half-brother, Kate's killer, as shown in the season 3 episode \\"Kill Ari (Part II)\\". Production The death of Sasha Alexander's character Kate Todd was a big part of the episode. The episode was written by Gary Glasberg and directed by James Whitmore, Jr. Glasberg wanted \\"to tell an emotional story for the characters\\" while at the same time \\"recap the last 8 seasons of the show\\", featured by old scenes using flashbacks from previous episodes. \\"The idea was to go back over eight seasons of television and pull bits and pieces\\", and \\"one of the trick with this episode was to find moments and opportunities for these sort of flashes to happen\\". For Mark Harmon, \\"this is [his] favourite kind of episode [because] it's everybody's story at the same time, and it all pushes all, including the crew, to do special things\\". The flashbacks were used to \\"get into the characters' souls\\", and would \\"have some emotional impact\\". \\"We had to go deep and tight\\" to get the right view. One big part of the episode is about the death of Special Agent Caitlin Todd back in the season 2 episode \\"Twilight\\", who was killed off following Sasha Alexander's decision to leave the show. Both McGee, DiNozzo, Abby and Gibbs have flashbacks of their former friend and colleague. \\"It was a lovely valentine to Sasha\\", and \\"after all these years to finally say thanks\\", commented director Whitmore. Sasha Alexander voiced her own character Caitlin Todd during the conversation between Kate and her sister Rachel. These characters appear as a flashback: Jimmy Palmer, Eli David, Ari Haswari, Director Shepard and Caitlin Todd. New and alternative scenes from earlier episodes were used to show key moments in the characters' lives, back to the very first episode \\"Yankee White\\". One scene has never been shown before, with Tony and Kate up on a roof, and is taken from the episode \\"An Eye for an Eye\\". It had been removed due to an editor cut before the episode aired. Michael Weatherly remembered the scene from the episode, and thought it could work for the episode. Inspired by an old M*A*S*H episode where the unit talks to a psychiatrist \\"to make sure they all haven't lost their minds\\", Glasberg got the idea of introducing Dr. Cranston as \\"an interesting approach on the show\\". This is the first episode to feature clips of all the main characters (except Emily Wickersham's character Ellie Bishop, who joined the cast in season 11) in the series, and it introduces Dr. Rachel Cranston as a new recurring character on the show. The title of the episode refer to the joke about a man who walks into a bar, and the response from the bartender. \\"Responses\\" in different situations is another big part of this episode, shown in flashbacks from the characters' own history of the show. Reception \\"A Man Walks Into a Bar...\\" was seen by 20.35 million live viewers following its broadcast on February 8, 2011, with a 12.1/19 share among all households, and a 4.2/12 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"A Man Walks Into a Bar...\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night, while the spin- off NCIS: Los Angeles drew second and was seen by 17.16 million viewers. It also became the fourth largest ratings for the week it aired. CBS had a \\"lost scene\\"-competition about an unseen scene between Tony and Kate up on a roof, taken from the episode \\"An Eye for an Eye\\" in season 2. The episode received positive reviews from critics and fans. Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic stated that \\"I had my doubts about the premise of this episode from the get-go, but the writers again deserve credit for turning what could have been clich√©d filler into excellent TV\\".

Formed in 2010 by Tom Dickins, (vocals, piano, ukulele) and Jen Kingwell (piano, vocals, ukulele), the band considers themselves an \\"indie cabaret duo with overtones of anti-folk and punk love\\". The duo has had a great amount of support by friend and fellow artist Amanda Palmer, and have supported her on her Goes Down Under Tour of 2011 as well as featured on her compilation record of the same name. Their debut album Somewhere Under The Rainbow was released through Bandcamp on 2 March 2012.  Career   Formation and Naming  Dickins and Kingwell met in 2009, during a cigarette break whilst working at a student union discovering mutual interests such as Regina Spektor and Nick Cave. Dickins at the time was planning a cabaret show, but was in need of a pianist, whereas Kingwell, a skilled pianist, was in need of a partner. The two began playing together in 2009, and in 2010 decided to make their musical partnership official. After initial difficulty settling on a name, the pair decided on The Jane Austen Argument, in reference to a long- running difference of opinion over the works of Jane Austen. Tom and Jen perform at The Spaces Between show (Photo by Ange Devery)  Early Performances  Prior to the release of their first EP, the duo performed at numerous music festivals within Australia, performing at Midsumma Festival and MONA FOMA. In 2010, they won the title of Best Cabaret Performance for their performance of Where Was I? at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, a title they won again in 2011, as well as being Highly Commended for the Best Cabaret award for their performance of The Spaces Between at Melbourne Fringe Festival.  The Birthing Pyre & Amanda Palmer Goes Down Under  Amanda Palmer, a long- time friend of Tom Dickins, promoted the band, often having them open for her at her own shows and performing alongside them. A recording of Dickins and Palmer performing a duet of Bad Wine and Lemon Cake at The Adelaide Fringe Festival was included in Palmer's 2011 album Amanda Palmer Goes Down Under. In January 2011, the duo supported the Amanda Palmer Goes Down Under tour, launching their debut EP The Birthing Pyre at Palmer's Australia Day Spectacular show at The Sydney Opera House on 26 January 2011. When recording the last track of the EP, The Debt Collectors, Dickins and Kingwell used social networking websites to advertise a need for backing vocals. Several fans recorded themselves singing and harmonising the parts described by Dickins, and sent the audio to the band. These fans are credited in the EP liner notes as the \\"Twitter Choir\\".  The Plan Behind (The Beautiful Mess We Made)  In May 2011, Dickins played his solo Fuck Plan B show at Revolt Melbourne. Named from an email from Amanda Palmer, in which she told him: \\"Jettison the job. Fuck Plan B. I'll support you in any way I can\\", Tom announced on 20 May at a show at Revolt Melbourne that he had quit his job and was dedicated to pursuing his musical career full-time. This gig was recorded, and released as the band's second EP, The Plan Behind (The Beautiful Mess We Made), which itself launched on 28 July 2011. Jen Kingwell recording vocals for Somewhere Under the Rainbow at London Bridge Studios (Photo by Ange Devery Tom Dickins recording vocals for Somewhere Under the Rainbow at London Bridge Studios (Photo by Ange Devery)  Pozible Fundraiser, Seattle, and Dickins- In-Exile  On 21 July 2011, the band announced their intentions to record their debut album, Somewhere Under The Rainbow, in Seattle. However, at that point they had not yet accumulated the finances to do this, so simultaneously, they announced a fundraiser, hosted by Australian crowdfunding website Pozible. Although the band required an additional $10 000 for their fund, they set their target donation total at $5 000, offering fans special gifts in exchange for donations. Rewards were conditional to the amount donated, and included a vast amount of goods, from a free digital download of Somewhere Under The Rainbow for $5, to appearances in future music videos for donations over $1000. As a result of their efforts of the band, and that of their fans, the band earned a total of $9063, 181% of their initial goal of $5 000. After performing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the band did a brief tour of Europe before setting in Seattle to record their album at London Bridge Studio. During this period, they also recorded a music video for a track on their upcoming album. The band released the first single, Holes, for order online on 3 November. The lyrics to the titular song were written by friend and famed author Neil Gaiman. After recording the tracks for Somewhere Under the Rainbow, the band accompanied Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman on a tour of North America on the Evening with Neil Gaiman & Amanda Palmer tour. After travelling to Canada for a show in Vancouver, Dickins was not permitted re- entry into the United States. This period became referred to by Dickins, and fans, as \\"Dickins-In-Exile\\". Shortly after, the band returned to Australia. In January 2012, The Jane Austen Argument supported The Dresden Dolls as an opening act on their tour of Australia.  Somewhere Under The Rainbow  On 24 February 2012, the Jane Austen Argument's debut album, Somewhere Under the Rainbow, was made available for pre-release download for those who donated to the Pozible fund. On 27 February 2012, Somewhere Under The Rainbow was made available for pre-order. Pre-ordering the album allowed buyers to download the first three tracks of the album prior to the release. The pre-order peaked at Number 1 on Bandcamp on the same day. The duo launched their album to the public on 2 March 2012 during a round of performances at Adelaide Fringe Festival. The Jane Austen Argument frequently perform \\"Twitnics\\" for their fans (Photo by Ange Devery)  Arrangement, Theatrics, and \\"Twitnics\\"  Both Tom Dickins and Jen Kingwell play piano and ukulele, as well as contribute vocals to their songs. Dickins can also play guitar. The arrangement of instruments and singing varies, though Kingwell generally plays the piano more often than Dickins, each contributing vocals equally. The band have adopted a unique style of dress when performing. Feathers, glitter, and make-up feature heavily in their costumes during their performances. Dickins has become well known for wearing a pair of upside-down black wings at his live performances. The duo also frequently include humour as part of their live performances. During the Amanda Palmer Goes Down Under Tour, the band began doing meets with fans, and small, free public performances. These soon became known as \\"Twitnics\\", a portmanteau referring to the use of social networking to plan and promote these small performances, as well as their picnic-like nature.

It was the first magazine to be published in Nepal Bhasa. It was published from Kolkata, India by Dharmaditya Dharmacharya.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal. Harvard University Press. . Pages 27-28. Retrieved 14 June 2011. Magazines Newar, Newari, or Nepal Bhasa, is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken by the Newar people, the indigenous inhabitants of Nepal Mandala, the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding regions in Nepal. Although \\"Nepal Bhasa\\" literally means \\"Nepalese language\\", the language is not the same as Nepali (DevanƒÅgarƒ´: ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä), the country's current official language. Dharmacharya (1902-1963) was the first Nepal Bhasa journalist. He served as editor and also wrote many of the articles in Buddha Dharma wo Nepal Bhasa. It was published in India instead of Nepal as the Rana dynasty disapproved of any attempt to promote either the religion or the language. Page 10. Originally named Buddha Dharma, the magazine's editorial policy later expanded from publicizing Theravada Buddhism to developing Nepal Bhasa. In 1927, its name was changed to Buddha Dharma wo Nepal Bhasa (Buddha Dharma and Nepal Bhasa), and it began including creative works in Nepal Bhasa too. The magazine folded in 1930. Dharmacharya was born Jagat Man Vaidya in Lalitpur.Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Page 96. Dharmodaya was a monthly magazine which launched in October 1947 in Kalimpong. It was published by Maniharsha Jyoti for Dharmodaya Sabha, an organization formed by Buddhist monks who had been expelled from Nepal in 1944 for promoting Theravada Buddhism.Joshi, Bhuwan Lal and Rose, Leo E. (1966) Democratic innovations in Nepal: A case study of political acculturation. University of California Press. Page 244. Pages 306-307. The first editors were monks Aniruddha and Mahanam Kobid. Dharmodaya had a major effect on standardizing the language. From 1949 to 1960, it was published from Kolkata. In 1977, the magazine was again published from Kalimpong with Bhaichand Pradhan as editor and Tara Upasak as publisher on behalf of Kalimpong Dharmodaya Sabha. In 1951, Thaunkanhe () (meaning \\"Nowadays\\"), the first Nepal Bhasa magazine to be published in Nepal, was launched. The monthly began publication on 21 May 1951 in Kathmandu and is still in print. The founding editor, deputy editor and publisher were Purna Kaji Tamrakar, Pushpa Ratna Sagar and Ratna Man Singh Tuladhar respectively. Page 81. In 1952, a literary quarterly Nepal appeared, published by Nepal Bhasa Parisad (Nepal Bhasa Council). The first editor was Hridaya Chandra Singh Pradhan. It is one of the major publications that emerged during the post-democracy period. Another early literary magazine was Jhee (Devanagari: ‡§ù‡•Ä) (meaning \\"We\\") which ran from 1958 to 1985.

It was edited by Prem Bahadur Kansakar and published by Chwasa Pasa. Situ helped to launch a host of new writers. Newspapers Scan of Biswabhumi daily dated 2 June 1999. The first daily newspaper in Nepal Bhasa was Nepal Bhasa Patrika which was published from Kathmandu on 28 September 1955. The first editor was Phatte Bahadur Singh. The daily ceased publication in 1983. In 1953, a weekly named Pasa (Devanagari: ‡§™‡§æ‡§∏‡§æ) (meaning \\"Friend\\") appeared. It was published by Chwasa Pasa (\\"Pen Friend\\"), a literary organization. Chwasa Pasa was formed in Kolkata in 1950 by exiled writers Prem Bahadur Kansakar and Madan Lochan Singh. After the Rana regime was pulled down and democracy established in 1951, the organization relocated to Kathmandu. In 1957, Pasa was published daily for three months when Krishna Chandra Singh Pradhan was the editor.Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Page 129. In 1983, a weekly newspaper Rajamati (Devanagari: ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø) was published from Lalitpur. It was brought out by Dharma Ratna Shakya and was originally published in the Nepali language. Inap (Devanagari: ‡§á‡§®‡§æ‡§™) appeared the same year, edited and published by Krishna Sundar Malla (Malla K. Sundar). It helped to create a new generation of journalists and was influential in arousing language awareness among Nepal Bhasa speakers. Page 449. Inap (meaning \\"Appeal\\") was in publication from 1983 till 1996. Biswabhumi, an eveninger formerly published in the Nepali language, began publication in Nepal Bhasa in 1987. Edited by Ashok Shrestha, it was the first evening daily in Nepal. During the 1990 People's Movement for democracy, it gained massive popularity for its coverage of breaking news. The daily remained in publication till 1999. Shrestha left Biswabhumi and brought out another eveninger named Nhugu Biswabhumi (meaning \\"New Biswabhumi\\") in 1992. Page 452.

The 15-minute program was dedicated to music, literature, and culture. Following the abolition of the parliamentary system and establishment of the Panchayat system and its \\"one country, one language\\" policy, the daily news bulletin was stopped on 13 April 1965.

He was a founding member of the National Bloc and served as 11th Prime Minister of Syria in 1939. Early career Al-Haffar was born into the wealthy merchant Damascene family of al-Haffar. His early career was mostly devoted to his family's business in trade. He joined the Damascus Chamber of Commerce in 1922, and became its deputy president in 1924. In 1923 in response to the water shortages in Damascus, al-Haffar established the Ayn al-Fijeh Waterworks Company, which pumped water from the Ayn al-Fijeh spring in the Ghouta area to the city of Damascus and constructed the first modern public water system in the city. The project was an immediate success, and allowed the water from the Barada river to be used for other purposes like irrigation. Political career French mandate Al-Haffar's involvement in politics came through his alliance with nationalist leader Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar. Shahbandar and Haffar founded the People's Party, which was the first political party in Syria under the French Mandate. The party advocated the unity of Greater Syria, and the abolition of the French Mandate. The party was banned shortly thereafter by French authorities because of suspected links to the 1925 uprising in Jabal al-Druze. After the French bombardment of Damascus following the revolt, al-Haffar spearheaded a call to end armed resistance to the French in favor of political struggle. Al-Haffar joined Ahmad Nami's cabinet as minister of public works and economy in April 1926, but resigned two months later in protest of French interference. He was arrested by the mandate authorities and detained until 1928. National Bloc In 1928 al-Haffar, along with a number of nationalist leaders, founded the National Bloc in Beirut. The Bloc, under the leadership of Hashim al-Atassi, became the central umbrella group for political resistance against the French occupation. Al-Haffar was elected to the national constitutional assembly in 1928, which was tasked with drafting Syria's first republican constitution. Al-Haffar was an active participant and organizer in the 1936 Syrian general strike. The strike lasted sixty-days, and al-Haffar was arrested during a demonstration against the French-appointed prime minister, Taj al-Din al-Hasani. To end the protests, France invited the Bloc to Paris for negotiations which eventually resulted in the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence. In July, parliamentary elections were held and the National Bloc was elected with an overwhelming majority. Al-Atassi was elected president, and Jamil Mardam Bey prime minister. Al-Haffar served as minister of finance in Mardam Bey's cabinet until July 1938. On 24 February 1939, al-Haffar was appointed prime minister by President al-Atassi. The cabinet, in which he also headed the education portfolio, lasted less than two months and was faced with a growing opposition under the leadership of al-Haffar's former ally, al- Shahbandar. In 1940 al-Shahbandar was assassinated and al-Haffar, along with three other leaders in the National Bloc, was tried before a French military tribunal. Al-Haffar escaped to Baghdad, and remained there until he was acquitted by the courts. During the presidency of Shukri al-Quwatli between 1943 and 1946, al-Haffar served as minister of interior in three different cabinets under Prime Ministers Saadallah al-Jabiri and Faris al-Khoury. Independence In 1947 the National Bloc split into two competing parties, the National Party and the People's Party. Al-Haffar joined the National Party and became its secretary-general. He served as deputy to Prime Minister Mardam Bey until the military coup of Chief of Staff Husni al-Za'im overthrew the Quwatli administration. Al-Haffar was arrested along with most of Quwatli's allies. He was released after direct interference by former Lebanese Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Karami.  Later years  Lutfi al-Haffar's role in Syrian politics diminished in later years, and he held no official posts in the 1950s. He opposed the 1958 union between Egypt and Syria and signed the secession declaration supporting the military coup which ended the union in 1961. He retired from politics after the March 1963 Baath-led coup d'√©tat.

Premiered in 2010, it combines elements from the music of China with composition techniques of Western classical music. Similar to the children's game, phrases change as they pass from part to part. The work was awarded the \\"BCMS Composition Prize\\" of the Birmingham Chamber Music Society in 2011.  History  The impetus for the composition came from a European family living in Shanghai. They wanted music combining aspects of Eastern and Western culture for their two eldest children to play with two Chinese musicians.  Movements  # Lento ‚Äì Adagio e maestoso ‚Äì Moderato # Allegro (pizzicato) # Vivace  Music  The work uses Chinese elements such as the pentatonic scale, seen from the perspective of a classically trained European composer. The title refers to the children's game in which a message is whispered from one child to the next and slowly changes. This process, a phrase changing almost imperceptibly as it passes from part to part, is a compositional procedure of the piece. The composer describes the work: \\"The first movement opens with the stylized chiming of a great imaginary temple bell, as if calling to attention.\\" The themes in the following \\"Moderato\\" occasionally use pentatonic scale in modes shown to the composer by the Chinese Jinghu player. Different from Chinese music, the thematic material is developed. The second movement is like a Scherzo and Trio in ambiguous triple/duple time. Played almost entirely pizzicato with the exception of ten bars in the centre of the movement, it is \\"a study in texture and voice- leading, combining the brittle pizzicato of the E-string of the violin with the resonant lower strings of the cello\\". The last movement recalls the Rondo- form, but \\"the main theme is forever changing and re-inventing itself. A short violin cadenza \\"seems to caricature the perpetual forward momentum of the work, deceiving the listener with speed changes and abrupt changes of rhythmic direction\\".  Selected performances  The work was first tried in the opening concert of the National Chamber Music Course, a summer course in Preston, UK, where the composer has worked as an instructor. The first professional performance was played at the Gasteig in Munich on 14 November 2011, combined with the composer's Piccolo Quintet. It appeared in a concert in Gilching of chamber music by Beethoven and Waterhouse, together with Rhapsodie Macabre for piano and string quartet, played by Valentina Babor. A review in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung noted its diverse colours, from delicate translucency to dashing folklore.  Award  The work received the chamber music prize of the Birmingham Chamber Music Society (BCMS), the \\"BCMS Composition Prize\\", in the society's 60th anniversary season. It was performed on 18 February 2012 by the Poggi String Quartet in the Adrian Boult Hall of the Birmingham Conservatoire, together with works of Schubert (Trout Quintet), Britten (Lachrymae) and the premiere of Berceuse by John McCabe, a commission of the BCMS. The review noted: \\"A totally accessible work depicting the mysterious East, very oriental ‚Äì smiling music\\".

It is a coprophagous fly that feeds on dung.Rohner, P. T., B√§chli, G. , Pollini Paltrinieri, L. , Duelli, P. , Obrist, M. K., Jochmann, R. and Blanckenhorn, W. U. (2015), Distribution, diversity gradients and Rapoport's elevational rule in the black scavenger flies of the Swiss Alps (Diptera: Sepsidae). Insect Conserv Divers, 8: 367-376. doi:10.1111/icad.12114 These flies are most commonly found around freshly laid cattle dung where they eat and reproduce. Due to human agricultural practices involving cows, these flies are now common in other areas of the world. Sepsis cynipsea has been studied extensively due to its sexual selection and reproductive practices. They exhibit sexual conflict: males compete for females and mount females to guard them for reproductive purposes. The females have been observed attempting to shake the males off. Description These dung flies are black in color, and approximately 4‚Äì5 mm long. They have two translucent wings that contain one dark spot near the tip of each. They look like ants, and often are difficult to identify without a microscope due to their appearance. Distribution Typical habitat of S. cynipsea Sepsis cynipsea dung flies are most commonly found in Europe. They prefer warm temperatures and can be more easily found from May to October in lower altitudes, and June to September in higher altitudes where the temperature is typically cooler. In higher altitudes, female flies have shorter lifespans, are smaller, and lay fewer clutches of eggs. They require fresh dung, primarily from cows and sheep, for reproduction. They also eat nectar which is a source of sugar. Altitude effects Sepsis cynipsea dung flies are often found in regions with varying altitudes, such as the Swiss Alps. Out of the many different Sepsidae species that are found in these regions, Sepsis cynipsea flies prefer intermediate altitudes but are found at all altitudes where other species of dung flies are found. In the areas where these fly species are prevalent, there is more species diversity at higher altitudes. Higher altitude environments tend to be more variable, so species found at higher altitudes have to be better at adapting to environmental changes. However, S. cynpisea flies at different altitudes enter Diapause at the same time and stop producing eggs at the same time in the season.Blanckenhorn, W. U. (1998). Altitudinal differentiation in the diapause response of two species of dung flies. Ecological Entomology 23, 1-8. Temperature effects Temperature during the larval phase of development impacts growth rates and final body size of Sepsis cynipsea. S. cynipsea grow the best at intermediate temperatures compared to similar species. However, in colder temperatures, S. cynipsea growth rates may increase so that they can reach adulthood before a cold season. Their growth rate also increases with warmer temperatures. At , it takes approximately 7 days for S. cynipsea flies to mature from eggs to adults. Resource availability, which can vary based on environmental conditions and competition with other species, also has an impact on the size of an adult body. S. cynipsea primarily uses temperature to determine when to enter Diapause. Competition Because Sepsidae flies are often found in the same regions, there can be competition between species, like from S. neocynipsea which also prefers fresh cow dung for reproduction. However, some fly species, like S. duplicata prefer dry and old cow dung; this is known as niche differentiation. Mating Reproduction Sepsis cynipsea flies are most known for their mating practices that involve sexual conflict. Their mating habits have been extensively studied to better understand sexual selection, female choice, and reluctance in mating. Sepsis cynipsea flies require fresh dung to mate,Teuschl, Y; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U (2007). The reluctant fly: what makes Sepsis cynipsea females willing to copulate? Animal Behaviour, 73(1):85-97. and they prefer dung that is less than one hour old.Parker, G..A. (1972). Reproductive Behaviour of Sepsis Cynipsea (L.) (Diptera: Sepsidae) I. a Preliminary Analysis of the Reproductive Strategy and Its Associated Behaviour Patterns, Behaviour, 41(1-2), 172-205. doi: https://doi.org/10.1163/156853972X00257 Females land on the fresh dung, where large numbers of males are already waiting,Blanckenhorn, W. U., M√ºhlh√§user, C. , Morf, C. , Reusch, T. and Reuter, M. (2000), Female Choice, Female Reluctance to Mate and Sexual Selection on Body Size in the Dung Fly Sepsis cynipsea. Ethology, 106: 577-593. doi:10.1046/j.1439-0310.2000.00573.x and ingest fresh dung. The females lay their eggs on the dung, and while they are laying their eggs, a male gets on top of the female and guards her. Males are not selective for females; they tend to mount the first female they encounter on the dung. However, this is not copulation. The eggs she is laying are fertilized from a previous mate. After she lays her eggs on the fresh dung, she and the male move to the grass that surrounds the dung pile, where they have the opportunity to mate, although most pairs do not, as the female successfully shakes the male off. If they do make genital contact and mate, the next eggs she lays will probably be his. When the eggs hatch and the larvae emerge, the larvae eat the dung and then leave. S. cynipsea flies have evolved to develop quickly so they avoid competition with other coprophagous organisms and before the dung dries up.Blanckenhorn, W. U. (1999). Different growth responses to temperature and resource limitation in three fly species with similar life histories. Evolutionary Ecology 13: 395-409 Sexual conflict Female Sepsis cynipsea flies are larger than the males, and because of this, a male cannot force a female to copulate with him. However, there is a lot of male competition. There are usually far more males than females on a dung pile, which leads to the ability for females to be selective. If a female does not want to mate with a male, she begins to shake her body, which either indicates to males that she does not want to mate or functions shake the male off of her body.Wolf U. Blanckenhorn, David J. Hosken, Oliver Y. Martin, Constanze Reim, Yvonne Teuschl, Paul I. Ward, The costs of copulating in the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea, Behavioral Ecology, Volume 13, Issue 3, May 2002, Pages 353‚Äì358, https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/13.3.353  Mate choice  Larger males are more successful at mounting and mating with females, and larger females lay larger clutches of eggs. In populations with greater mean body sizes, sexual selection is stronger compared to populations with smaller body sizes. Once the male and female move into the grass after she lays her eggs, only about 40% of the pairs actually copulate. And when they do, there is evidence to suggest that females get physically injured in the process. The male reproductive organ is spiney, and females are left with scars and have a higher mortality after mating. This genital organ is most likely so armored to make it hard for the females to shake the males off; the male has to spin 180 degrees to get his genital organ out of the female. If a female does not shake the male off, they copulate. The flies then find another dung site 2‚Äì4 days later to repeat the process. This results in approximately six generations to progress during each breeding season. Evolution Sexual dimorphisms In the family Sepsidae, there is clear sexual dimorphism. The male foreleg, for example, differs greatly from a female foreleg, and differs in between Sepsidae species, as well.Puniamoorthy, N., Su, K., & Meier, R. (2008). Bending for love: losses and gains of sexual dimorphisms are strictly correlated with changes in the mounting position of sepsid flies (Sepsidae: Diptera). BMC Evolutionary Biology, 8(1), 155. https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-155 The Morphology (biology) of the male foreleg evolved to aid the male in mounting the female and staying on her during her characteristic body shaking. The male foreleg has evolved to have bristles, indentations, or bumps, which attach to the wing veins and cells on the female's wings. In response to this, the female can bend her abdomen to prevent genital contact with the male. In some Sepsidae species without adapted forelegs, the males have adapted an abdomen that bends to make contact with the female genitalia. These sexually dimorphic characteristics can be very different between closely related species, so sexually dimorphic characteristics evolve quickly and are involved in speciation in the family Sepsidae. Taxonomy The family Sepsidae contains more than 320 species and 37 genera, which are globally widespread.Zhao, L., Annie, A. S. H., Amrita, S., Yi, S. K. F., & Rudolf, M. (2013). Does better taxon sampling help? A new phylogenetic hypothesis for Sepsidae (Diptera: Cyclorrhapha) based on 50 new taxa and the same old mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 69(1), 153‚Äì164. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2013.05.011 The sister species S. neocynipsea and S. cynipsea are found on different continents: S. neocynipsea in North America and S. cynipsea in Europe primarily. Sepsis has more species than other genera of the family Sepsidae. Sepsidae is monophyletic, with many different clades, including the Neotropical sepsids, the African clade, and the higher sepsids. The sexually dimorphic traits, such as the moveable abdomens, evolved independently multiple times. Sister species Sepsis neocynipsea is only recently diverged from Sepsis cynipsea.Giesen, A, Sch√§fer, MA, Blanckenhorn, WU. Geographic patterns of postzygotic isolation between two closely related widespread dung fly species (Sepsis cynipsea and Sepsis neocynipsea; Diptera: Sepsidae). J Zool Syst Evol Res. 2019; 57: 80‚Äì 90. https://doi.org/10.1111/jzs.12239 Even though both species are widespread, overlap geographically, and have similar mitochondrial gene sequences, they have different behaviors and morphologies. While S. neocynipsea is most commonly found in North America, it is also present in some of the same geographic locations that S. cynipsea is found in, like the Swiss Alps. While S. cynipsea and S. neocynipsea cross-breeding events can produce hybrid offspring, these offspring are typically infertile or have low fertility. Pre- and post-zygotic barriers between the species are still forming, so they are recently diverged. In S. cynipsea, female shaking during mating events is more visible than in S. neocynipsea.Giesen, A., Blanckenhorn, W. U., & Sch√§fer, M. A. (2017). Behavioural mechanisms of reproductive isolation between two hybridizing dung fly species. Animal Behaviour, 132, 155‚Äì166. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.08.008 S. cynipsea flies also have higher rates of successful matings per mating attempts than S. neocynipsea do. Genetics There are high levels of genetic variability between flies, especially related to form. The heritability of these morphological traits ranges between 0.33-0.90 for males, but is lower for females.Reusch, T., & Blanckenhorn, W. U. (1998). Quantitative genetics of the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea: Cheverud‚Äôs conjecture revisited. Heredity, 81(1), 111‚Äì119. https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2540.1998.00368.x Male Sepsis cynipsea flies are smaller than females for all traits except for the width of the fore femur. Body size and male leg features are selected for, so evolution works on these traits and contributes to sexual dimorphism.

Speech consists of an organized set of sounds or phonemes that are used to convey meaning while language is an arbitrary association of symbols used according to prescribed rules to convey meaning.Bernthal, J.E., Bankson, N.W., & Flipsen, P. (2009) Articulation and Phonological Disorders: Speech Sound Disorders in Children. (6th edition). Boston, MA: Pearson. While grammatical and syntactic learning can be seen as a part of language acquisition, speech acquisition focuses on the development of speech perception and speech production over the first years of a child's lifetime. There are several models to explain the norms of speech sound or phoneme acquisition in children.  Development of speech perception  Sensory learning concerning acoustic speech signals already starts during pregnancy. Hepper and Shahidullah (1992) described the progression of fetal response to different pure tone frequencies. They suggested fetuses respond to 500 Hertz (Hz) at 19 weeks gestation, 250 Hz and 500 Hz at 27 weeks gestation and finally respond to 250, 500, 1000, 3000 Hz between 33 and 35 weeks gestation.Hepper, P. G., & Shahidullah, B. S. (1994). Development of fetal hearing. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition, 71(2), F81‚ÄìF87. Lanky and Williams (2005)Lasky, R.E. & Trickey, A.W. (2005). The Development of the Auditory System from Conception to Term. NeoReviews 6(3). DOI: 10.1542/neo.6-3-e141. suggested that fetuses could respond to pure tone stimuli of 500 Hz as early as 16 weeks. The newborn is already capable of discerning many phonetic contrasts. This capability may be innate. Speech perception becomes language- specific for vowels at around 6 months, for sound combinations at around 9 months and for language-specific consonants at around 11 months. It is also important that a newborn is already capable of detecting typical word stress patterns around the age of 8 months. As an infant grows into a child their ability to discriminate between speech sounds should increase. Rvachew (2007)Rvachew, S. (2007). Phonological Processing and Reading in Children With Speech Sound Disorders. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology. 16. 260-270. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9b7e/1674775fc3775c9c1a1da4b57c1e0ed2e821.pdf described three developmental stages in which a child recognizes or discerns adult-like, phonological and articulatory representations of sounds. In the first stage, the child is generally unaware of phonological contrast and can produce sounds that are acoustically and perceptually similar. In the second stage the child is aware of phonological contrasts and can produce acoustically different variations imperceptible to adult listeners. Finally, in the third stage, children become aware of phonological contrasts and produce different sounds that are perceptually and acoustically accurate to an adult production. It is suggested that a child's perceptual capabilities continue to develop for many years. Hazan and Barrett (2000)Hazan, V. & Barrett, S.(2000) Development of phonemic categorization in children aged 6-12. Journal of Phonetics 28(4):377-396 ¬∑ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222834995_The_development_of_phonemic_categorization_in_children_aged_6-12 suggest that this development can cotton into late childhood; 6 to 12 year old children showed increasing mastery of discriminating synthesized differences in place, manner, and voicing of speech sounds with out yet achieving adult- like accuracy in their own production.  Typologies of infant vocalization Infants are born with the ability to vocalize, most notably through crying. As they grow and develop, infants add more sounds to their inventory. There are two primary typologies of infant vocalizations. Typology 1: Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development consists of 5 phases. #Reflexive (0 to 2 months of age) consisting of crying, fussing, and vegetative sounds #Control of phonation (1 to 4 months of age) consonant-like sounds, clicks, and raspberry sound #Expansion (3 to 8 months of age) isolated vowels, two or more vowels in a row, and squeals #Basic canonical syllables (5 to 10 months of age) ‚Äì a consonant vowel (CV) combination, often repeated (e.g. ba ba ba ba). #Advanced forms (9 to 18 months of age) complex combinations of differing constant-vowel combinations (CVC) and jargon. Typology 2: Oller's typology of infant phonations consists primarily of 2 phases with several substages. The 2 primary phases include Non-speech-like vocalizations and Speech-like vocalizations. Non-speech-like vocalizations include a. vegetative sounds such as burping and b. fixed vocal signals like crying or laughing. Speech-like vocalizations consist of a. quasi-vowels, b. primitive articulation, c. expansion stage and d. canonical babbling.  Speech sound normative data  Knowing when a speech sound should be accurately produced helps parents and professionals determine when child may have an articulation disorder. There have been two traditional methods used to compare a child's articulation of speech sounds to chronological age. The first is comparing the number of correct responses on a standardized articulation test with the normative data for a given age on the same test. This allows evaluators to see how well a child is producing sounds compared to their same aged peers. The second method consists of comparing an individual sound a child produces with developmental norms for that individual sound. The second method can be difficult when considering the differing normative data and other factors that affect typical speech development. Many norms are based on age expectations in which a majority of children of a certain age are accurately producing a sound (75% or 90% depending on the study).

In preparation for the new tramway, the corporation opened a new power station in the town in December 1900.The Light Railways of Darlington, G.S. Hearse, Tramway Review, Vol. 2, Issue 9, 1953. The corporation bought out the Stockton and Darlington Steam Tramway Company which (despite its name) had been operating horse-drawn trams in Darlington since 1880. The price paid for this was ¬£7,600. The lines were leased to C.J. O'Dowd who continued to operate them until 18 August 1903, when the service was withdrawn for reconstruction. Kennedy and Jenkins were appointed consulting engineers, and the contractor for the permanent way was Messrs J.G. White and Company. The overhead wires were erected by Brush Electrical Equipment Company. A depot was erected in Haughton Road. On 25 May 1904, the system was inspected by the Board of Trade and passed fit for public use. It was opened by the Mayoress Mrs A Henderson, who drove the first car on 1 June 1904. Fleet Model of a Darlington Corporation Light Railways tramcar at the National Tramway Museum The company purchased 16 single deck cars from G.F. Milnes & Co. By 1912, the traffic had increased to such an extent that 2 double deck 56-seater cars were purchased from the United Electric Car Company of Preston. In 1918, 8 cars were obtained second hand from the Sheerness and District Tramways, which had closed the previous year. Six of these were put into service, and the remainder were used for spare parts. They were originally built by Brush Electrical Machines. Closure The system closed on 10 April 1926. The services were replaced by the Darlington trolleybus system. The 24 tramcars were offered for sale, the two double deck cars were sold to the Dover Corporation Tramways for ¬£350 the pair.

Amongst its members were editors, journalists, publishers and businesspeople who were involved in declared conservative newspapers. The activity in the association faded out concurrently with the discontinuance of party newspapers in Norway. History Founding and heyday Christian Friele was honorary member of the association, despite not attending any of its meetings. The Conservative Press Association was established on 29 August 1892 in the headquarters of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons, with Nils Vogt and Amandus Schibsted as initiators. It was not the first press association in Norway; the Norwegian Journalist Association had erstwhile been established on 24 January 1883. Vogt was elected the first chairman, and served in this position until 1906, apart from an interruption from 1898 to 1906. The editor of Morgenbladet, Christian Friele, was an honorary member of the association, despite not attending any of its meetings. In 1894, the Liberal Press Association () was established. Despite their irreconcilable political positions, the two press associations cooperated extensively; in 1899 they issued a leaflet on Norway's political position in the dissolution of the personal union with Sweden in 1905. The association championed the Riksm√•l standard of written Norwegian and opposed the Samnorsk line. The chairman Thorstein Diesen was, however, ambivalent towards this approach; he maintained that the endeavour for the Riksm√•l standard ought not to become a conservative cause. At the Conservative Party's national convention in 1893, it was decided that the press association could send its own delegation to future national conventions. At the 1908 convention, Amandus Schibsted suggested to the central board of the party that it grant all chief editors of the press association access to the party's national conventions. This suggestion was adopted; the editors could thereupon access the national conventions on the same conditions as members of parliament. In the 1930s, it was called for a unification of the conservative newspapers in the country. Rolv Werner Erichsen, an ardent conservative, established an office for the administration of the Conservative Party's newspapers in 1935. It was located in the editorial office of the Morgenbladet newspaper and distributed news material to newspapers that subscribed to the office's deliveries. In the late 1930s, the association remained sceptical towards fascism and nazism, and argued against creating affinities between the conservative newspapers, Nasjonal Samling and the Fatherland League. It also opposed proposals to encroach free speech. Post-war years and decline The editor Johs. Nesse of Aftenposten summoned the first meeting in the association after the war, on 19 October 1945. Chief editor Harald Torp was elected chairman, despite not attending the meeting. The association experienced increasing number of members after the war; in 1945 it had 55, whilst it in the following year had 65 members. The efforts to unite the conservative press were resumed after the war; in 1945 the joint body Norsk H√∏yrepresse (\\"Norwegian Conservative Press\\") was established, comprising DKPF and H√∏yres Bladeierforening (\\"The Conservative Party's Newspaper Owner Association\\"). The joint body organised the merger of H√∏irepressens Propaganda- og Organisasjonskontor and H√∏irepressens Oslokontor; together they formed H√∏ires Pressekontor, which eventually was renamed H√∏yres Pressebyr√•.Translations of the names are as follows: \\"The Conservative Press's Propaganda and Organisation Office\\", \\"The Conservative Press Office in Oslo\\", \\"The Conservative Party's Press Office\\" and \\"The Conservative Party's Press Agency\\". DKPF lost political influence in the 1960s and beyond, despite its heavy representation in the organs of the Conservative Party. In the early 1970s, the conservative newspapers in the country became subject of criticism, and their representation in the organs of the party was called into question. Towards the end of the 1980s, the chairman Fredrik Th. Bolin urged the conservative newspapers in the country to cease using the description \\"right- wing press\\", as the newspapers were neither owned, edited nor organised by the Conservative Party. In 2002, the remaining activity in the association vanished.

He killed V√≠ctor R√≠os Acevedo (a.k.a. Ni√±o Viejo/Old Boy) on Saturday January 7, 2012 in an apparent act of self-defense near the intersection of Tacna Avenue and Colmena Avenue, in Lima, Peru. According to Mansilla, two muggers approached him armed with switchblades and demanded his phone and backpack. Mansilla, who had a valid concealed weapons permit at the time of the attack, drew his .38 caliber pistol and during a scuffle fired at point blank range, killing Acevedo. Acevedo's accomplice, Christian Arenas Perona, attempted to flee, but was immediately detained by police. According to Mansilla's attorney, an eyewitness corroborates Mr. Mansilla's story. Mansilla was arrested and charged with second degree murder and/or violation of the Peruvian Law of Proportionality, a law that had been repealed in 2003. Under the terms of this law, self-defense must be conducted only with a weapon similar to that employed by an attacker. In this case the assailants were armed with knives. The Third Penal Court's decision to keep Mansilla in jail during the investigation was immediately objected to by his family and friends who staged a demonstration calling for his immediate release. Education Faculty dean Manuel Asmat and Congressman Juan D√≠az Dios presented a writ of habeas corpus on Mansilla's behalf. Classmate Marco Vargas Romero labeled the judge's decision, \\"unbelievable\\" \\"surprising\\" and \\"arbitrary\\". Several other Congressmen also spoke in Mansilla's defense, including Renzo Reggiardo, who criticized Judge Asunci√≥n Puma Le√≥n's decision to order Mansilla's arrest, and V√≠ctor Andr√©s Garc√≠a Bela√∫nde, who said the court's decision to imprison Mansilla is an \\"abuse\\" that must be sanctioned by the Office of the Control of the Magistrate (OCMA). Congressman D√≠az indicated that he would send a report to OCMA and to the president of the Justice System. On 12 January 2012, Jos√© Luis P√©rez, head of the Instituto Nacional Penitenciario (INPE), received a judicial order for Mansilla's release issued by Juan Carlos Aranda Giraldo, who presides over the second penal court, revoking the detention order. Mansilla was liberated on 13 January 2012. On 13 January 2012 OCMA suspended Puma while the disciplinary process against her is resolved. On 13 January the judge appeared on the TV Program 90 seconds to defend her actions. \\"I am not inept,\\" she declared. \\"I have no reason to regret making an appealable jurisdictional decision.\\" She denied that the decision to jail Mansilla pending the investigation was prompted by the Law of Proportionality. The judge turned in her letter of resignation at that time, but this did not end the disciplinary investigation against her.

See for instance: Carlo Lottieri, The Opening of the Chinese Market and Individual Rights , IBL Briefing Paper, June 25, 2005. Lottieri's research develops a radical libertarianism combining a strong emphasis on the inviolability of other people (marked by the influence of Emmanuel L√©vinas) and a realistic approach to the modern State, largely influenced by Italian elitist school, Carl Schmitt's scholarship and Public Choice and Austrian School economists. Following Raimondo Cubeddu and Alberto Mingardi, in his work Lottieri \\"argues for the legitimacy of many so-called 'monopolistic practices' (cartels, monopolization, mergers, predatory pricing‚Ä¶), and for the legitimacy of conglomerates, and big business at large, vis-√†-vis those governmental agencies built to thoroughly implement 'competition' from top to bottom\\".Raimondo Cubeddu - Alberto Mingardi, \\"Preface\\", Ethics & Politics, 2003, 2, p. 2.

Background  The village of Galimpur was located on the northern banks of the Kushiara river in the jurisdiction of Balaganj police station in the district of Sylhet. On 18 May 1971, the villagers of Galimpur had an altercation with the villagers of nearby Ballabhpur regarding the harvesting of crop. The two parties were called to a village court where the matter was settled. On the morning of 19 May, Madrichh Ali of nearby Fazilpur arrived at Galimpur along with his associates. He explained to the villagers that the captain of the Pakistani army camping at Sherpur had come to know of the dispute. The village of Galimpur can only be saved from attack by the army only if they pay enough money. The villagers of Galimpur were extorted of two thousand five hundred rupees in this manner.  Killings  On the afternoon of 20 May, at around 2 P.M., the Pakistani occupation army entered Galimpur through Ballabhpur by the way of Goalabazar. They were led by local Razakar Abdul Ahad Chowdhury and Kala Maulavi, a madrassa teacher from Sherpur. On entering they rounded up six villagers and shot them dead. They were later buried beside the flood control embankment on the Kushiara. When the villagers began running for their lives, the Pakistani soldiers fired indiscriminately killing 26 villagers including four teenagers. then they looted the village of gold, jewellery, cash and other valuables. Finally they set the village on fire. They took hostage two women from the village. More than hundred houses in the village was burnt to ashes within two to three hours.  Aftermath  After the Liberation War, M.A.G. Osmani visited Galimpur. He provided a relief of two thousand rupees and 14 corrugated iron sheets to each affected family. He himself distributed food among the villagers. He also made plans for the permanent rehabilitation of the victims through setting up a hand loom industry. He arranged for two hand looms and a capital of ten thousand rupees to found a co-operative. He also promised to build up a memorial in the memory of the victims. In 2000, the memorial was built with funding from M.P. Shah Azizur Rahman.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Lancaster and Morecambe, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with those of Christ Church, Over Wyresdale, and St Peter, Quernmore. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St Mark's was built between 1897 and 1898 to a design by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. The church was built to replace an older church erected some 60 years earlier for the use of local mill workers. The new church cost ¬£3,300 (), and provided seating for 497 people. It was consecrated on 25 January 1899. Architecture The church is constructed in sandstone rubble, with a green slate roof. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave, a north aisle, a north porch, and a chancel. At the crossing is a tower, with a north transept, and a lean-to extension to the south. At the southwest corner of the tower is a stair turret. There are buttresses on the east and west sides of the tower, and a three-light window on the south side. At the summit is a plain parapet, and a pyramidal roof with a weathervane. Along the wall of the aisle are four two-light windows. The porch contains a pointed doorway under a gable with a cross finial. The north and south sides of the chancel each contain a two- light window. The east window has five lights. Along the south wall of the nave are three windows, two with three lights, the other with two lights. To the west of these is a doorway with a pointed head. Inside the church is a three-bay arcade carried on octagonal piers. The chancel contains a piscina with a trefoil head. The font has a cover dated 1910. The stained glass dates from the 20th century, and depicts Saint Mark and Saint Peter. The two-manual organ was built in 1927 by R. G. Phillips of Preston. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner wrote that \\"one would have to search far and search long in England to find village churches to vie with\\" this and two other Austin and Paley churches, Torver and Finsthwaite.

He was the father of architect Knud Arne Petersen. Biography Vilhelm Petersen was born in Copenhagen in 1830. He was admitted to the Art Academy in 1843, when just 13 years old, where he initially studied decorative arts. Later he turned to architecture and became a student of Gustav Friedrich Hetsch for whom he also worked as an assistant and draughtsman. For a few years he also apprenticed as a mason to acquire practical knowledge of the building trade. In 1856, he won the Academy's Honorary Medal and in 1860 its large gold medal which was accompanied by a four-year travel scholarship which brought him to Germany, the Netherlands, France and Italy. Back in Denmark, he became a member of the Art Academy in 1866 and he served as Building Inspector in Copenhagen from 1869 until 1874. He became a titular professor at the Art Academy and from 1887 until 1911 was a member of the Academy Council. In 1892 he received appointment as Royal Building Inspector, an office he held until his death.  Works Vilhelm Petersen's earliest independent works include a new Custom House and a building for the Royal Nautical Charts Archive and Meteorological Institute, both completed at Nordre Toldbod in Copenhagen in 1873. Another early work was a large residential development, S√∏torvet, which he designed for the Copenhagen Building Company in collaboration with Ferdinand Vilhelm Jensen and under supervision of Ferdinand Meldahl. It was built on a prominent location overlooking The Copenhagen Lakes between 1873 and 1876 and relied on inspiration from Paris. His new Town Hall and Jailhouse in Roskilde was completed in 1878. His building for the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters at Dantes Plads in Copenhagen, built between 1894 and 1898 in Renaissance Revival style, is considered his most successful work.

Name The Hebrew name, Nahal Tekoa (\\"Tekoa Stream\\"), and the English name used in some Christian contexts, Tekoa Valley, is derived from the ancient Judahite town of Tekoa. The Arabic name, Wadi Khureitun, comes from the early Christian hermit, Saint Chariton the Confessor, who founded his third lavra in this valley.. Description, history, archaeology A hiking path on the west of the wadi passes a number of prehistoric caves on its way south to the Chariton Monastery ruins. The archaeological Stone Age (Mesolithic and Neolithic) site of El Khiam is located in this area. Saint Chariton the Confessor (end of 3rd century-ca. 350) founded here the Lavra of Souka, later called the Old Lavra, and today popularly known as the Chariton Monastery. Existing karstic caves from the chalk stone of the wadi were expanded and used as hermit abodes by monks from the lavras of Saint Chariton and of a later desert monk and saint, Euthymius the Great. Modern Tekoa's former chief rabbi Menachem Froman's son, Tzuri, lived in the desert canyon wadi behind the town, in a cave.

This became the North Shields and District Tramways Company Limited in 1884, the North Shields and Tynemouth District Tramways Limited in 1890, and British Electric Traction Company in 1897. The horse tramway was closed in 1900 for electrification. The reconstruction of the line cost ¬£58,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) and eleven tramcars were purchased at a cost of ¬£700 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) each. One and a half miles of additional track was laid giving three and three-quarter route miles. The official inspection of the newly electrified line took place on 13 February 1901 when two double cars and a pilot car was run to convey the Board of Trade Inspector, the Mayor of Tynemouth (Mr. Jacob Dalglish), the Borough Surveyor (Mr. Smillie), with several alderman and councillors. Electric services started on 1 March 1901. The new electric line ran from the New Quay, North Shields to terminate at the Victoria Hotel, Whitley.

He was the first editor of the English criminal law textbook Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, which is still routinely used in court today. Life He was the second son of John Archbold of Co. Dublin. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 3 May 1809, and was called to the bar on 5 May 1814. From the beginning of his career Archbold devoted himself to compiling legal treatises. In 1811 he brought out an annotated edition of Blackstone's \\"Commentaries\\" (London, 4 vols. 8vo), with an analysis and an epitome of the work. In 1813, he issued the first volume of \\"A Digest of Pleas of the Crown\\" (London, 8vo), a compilation of all the statutes, adjudged cases, and other authorities upon the subject. This was one of three volumes of \\"A Digest of Criminal Law\\", which Archbold had prepared for the press, but as several books on the subject appeared about the same time he did not issue the other two volumes. In 1819, he published the first edition of what was perhaps his most notable work, \\"The Practice of the Court of King's Bench in Personal Actions and Ejectments\\" (London, 2 vols. 12mo). Previous to its appearance, \\"The Practice of the Court of King's Bench in Personal Actions\\" by William Tidd, was the leading work on the subject; but, while it maintained its place in the United States, it was largely superseded in England by Archbold's book, which was more explicit in regard to forms of procedure. Archbold's \\"Practice\\" went through fourteen editions. The third edition was edited by Thomas Chitty, who added to it the \\"Practice of the Courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer\\", and the ninth edition, which appeared in 1855-6, was edited by Samuel Prentice. The fourteenth edition, published in 1885, was revised by Thomas Willes Chitty and John William St. Lawrence Leslie. About 1824, Archbold published his \\"Summary of the Law relative to Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases\\", in which he incorporated the greater part of the two unpublished volumes of his \\"Digest of Criminal Law\\". The fourth (1831) and four succeeding editions were edited by (Sir) John Jervis, the tenth (1846) to the fifteenth (1862) by William Newland Welsby, and the sixteenth (1867) to the twenty-first (1893) by William Bruce. The twenty-second edition, by William Feilden Craies and Guy Stephenson, appeared in 1900. The work has gone through a number of editions in the United States. In 1829, Archbold published a work upon the \\"Practice of the Court of Common Pleas\\". Afterwards the practice of all courts of common law at Westminster was assimilated and much altered by the statutes and new rules of law on the subject between 1831 and 1834. To meet the altered conditions he published his \\"New Practice of Attornies in the Courts of Law at Westminster\\", which appeared in 1838, was remodelled in 1844, and reached a third edition in 1846-7 (London, 2 vols. 8vo). On the passage of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852, he prepared \\"The New Rules of Practice in the Courts of Law\\" (London, 1853, 8vo), and \\"The New Practice, Pleadings, and Evidence in the Courts of Common Law at Westminster\\" (London, 1853, 12mo), which received a supplement in 1854, and attained a second edition in 1855 (London, 8vo). Archbold's treatises on parish law were among his most important elucidations of English law. In 1828, he published \\"The Law relative to the Commitments and Convictions by Justices of the Peace\\" (London, 12mo). This was the foundation of his \\"Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer\\" (London, 1840, 3 vols. 12mo), a work intended as a practical guide for county magistrates. The similar treatise by Richard Burn had become, through the editions of successive editors, rather a work of reference for lawyers than a guide for magistrates. A seventh edition of Archbold's work by James Paterson appeared in 1876 (London, 2 vols. 8vo). The third volume of the original edition, which dealt with \\"The Poor Law\\", was in especial demand, and developed into a separate treatise, which was still a standard authority on the subject in 1901; the twelfth (1873), thirteenth (1878), and fourteenth (1885) editions of the volume on \\"The Poor Law\\" were prepared by William Cunningham Glen, and the fifteenth (1898) by James Brooks Little. Archbold's last contribution to parish law was \\"The Parish Officer\\" (London, 1852, 12mo); a second edition by Glen appeared in 1855. With the fourth edition (1864) the editor, James Paterson, incorporated Shaw's \\"Parish Law\\", by Joseph Shaw. The eighth edition by John Theodore Dodd, appeared in 1895. Archbold died on 28 November 1870, at 15 Gloucester Street, Regent's Park, London. He is said to have been known as \\"pretty Archbold\\" (cf. An Appeal to the People of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from James Wharton, York, 1836).

(2012.) Schizophrenic Speech: Making Sense of Bathroots and Ponds that Fall in Doorways, Cambridge University Press, is communication characterized by situationally-inappropriate formality. This formality can be expressed both through abnormal prosody as well as speech content that is \\"inappropriately pompous, legalistic, philosophical, or quaint\\".Peter F. Liddle, Royal College of Psychiatrists Disordered mind and brain: the neural basis of mental symptoms, 301 pages RCPsych Publications, 2001 Retrieved 2012-01-12 Often, such speech can act as evidence for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or a thought disorder,Victor Peralta, Manuel J.

To diagnose stilted speech, researchers have previously looked for the following characteristics: * speech conveying more information than necessary * vocabulary and grammar expected from formal writing rather than conversational speech * unneeded repetition or corrections While literal and long-winded word content is often the most identifiable feature of stilted speech, such speech often displays irregular prosody, especially in resonance. Often, the loudness, pitch, rate, and nasality of pedantic speech vary from normal speech, resulting in the perception of pedantic or stilted speaking. For example, overly loud or high-pitched speech can come across to listeners as overly forceful while slow or nasal speech creates an impression of condescension. These attributions, which are commonly found in patients with ASD, partially account for why stilted speech has been considered a diagnostic criterion for the disorder. Stilted speech, along with atypical intonation, semantic drift, terseness, and perseveration, are all qualities known to be commonly impaired during conversation with adolescents on the autistic spectrum. Often, stilted speech found in children with ASD will also be especially stereotypic or rehearsed. Patients with schizophrenia are also known to experience stilted speech. This symptom is attributed to both an inability to access more commonly used words and a difficulty understanding pragmatics‚Äîthe relationship between language and context. However, stilted speech appears as a less common symptom compared to a certain number of other symptoms of the psychosis (Adler et al 1999).Jeffrey A. Lieberman, T. Scott Stroup, Diana O.

The course was non-calculus-based, utilizing algebra and basic trigonometry to solve various physics problems. AP Physics B was divided into five different sections: Newtonian mechanics, fluid mechanics and thermal physics, electricity and magnetism, waves and optics, and atomic and nuclear physics. AP Physics B was replaced in 2014 by AP Physics 1 and 2. AP Physics 1 and 2 AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 were introduced for the 2015 exam administration. The courses were designed to emphasize critical thinking and reasoning as well as learning through inquiry. They remain as algebra-based courses that do not require students to have taken calculus. AP Physics 1 covers the same Newtonian mechanics as AP Physics B plus rotational mechanics, as well as an introduction to electricity (Coulomb's Law and simple DC circuits), and mechanical waves and sound. AP Physics 2 covers the remaining subjects from AP Physics B: thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity and magnetism, and modern physics. AP Physics C The College Board split AP Physics C into two different tests in 2006, each equivalent to a semester-length calculus-based college course for majors in physical science or engineering: * AP Physics C: Mechanics studies Newtonian mechanics, with units on kinematics; Newton's laws of motion; work, energy, and power; systems of particles and linear momentum; circular motion and rotation; and oscillations and gravitation. * AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism studies electricity and magnetism, covering electrostatics; conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics; electric circuits; magnetic fields; and electromagnetism.

Written by the German historian Wolfgang Behringer, himself a specialist in the Early Modern witch trials of Germany, Shaman of Oberstdorf was initially published in German as Chonrad Stoekhlin und die Nachtschar: Eine Geschichte aus der fr√ºhen Neuzeit by R. Piper GmbH & Co. in 1994. It was subsequently translated into English by H.C. Erik Midelfort and published in 1998 by the University of Virginia Press. The reviews published in specialist academic journals were largely positive, with several reviewers remarking that Behringer had presented a more believable case than Ginzburg for the existence of visionary traditions in Early Modern Europe. Background Shamanistic traditions in Early Modern Europe From the 1960s onward, various historians studying the witch trials on continental Europe had begun arguing that in some areas, the image of the witch had been influenced by underlying local folklore about visionary journeys. Poc's book on Hungarian witchcraft and magic appeared in her native language in 1997, before being published in an English translation in 1999 as Between the Living and the Dead. Behringer and his research Synopsis Arguments Reviews and reception Academic reviews Writing in Church History, the journal of the American Society of Church History, the historian Brian P. Levack of the University of Texas (2000) described Shaman of Oberstdorf as a \\"fascinating study of popular witch beliefs in late-sixteenth-century Germany\\", relating that the \\"most valuable part of Behringer's investigation lies in his exploration\\" of these popular beliefs and how they \\"served as a prelude to the massive regional witch hunt that took place in southern Germany from 1587 until 1592.\\" Ultimately, he felt that the book was \\"a carefully constructed, judicious, and gracefully translated work of original scholarship that illuminates some of the most important issues in the history of witchcraft and the history of popular culture. It deserves a wide audience.\\" Georg Modestin of the University of Fribourg (2000) reviewed Behringer's book for The Sixteenth Century Journal, in which he remarked that it was \\"obvious that the issue of this particular book is not social history\\", instead focusing in on \\"Stoeckhlin's depositions\\". In this respect, Modestin felt that Shaman of Oberstdorf was exploring a form of \\"mythical archaeology\\" which \\"may at times remind one of Carlo Ginzburg's attempts in Ecstasies\\"; however Modestin recognised that \\"Behringer is well aware of all the pitfalls related to the subject\\", thereby not expanding his search for the origins of the shamanistic visionary traditions into prehistory as Ginzburg had done. Although predominantly positive about the book, Modestin did criticise the choice of title chosen for the English translation, believing that \\"Shaman of Oberstdorf\\" was \\"unnecessarily spectacular\\" considering the fact that in the book, \\"Behringer only very tentatively speaks of shamanism.\\"Modestin 2000. The American History Review published a review written by Trevor Johnson (2001) of the University of the West of England, Bristol, in which he described Behringer's work in a positive manner. Johnson noted that Behringer \\"deftly unpacks the nuances of Alpine legend-motifs from the often careless and na√Øve, if not designing, assumptions of nineteenth and twentieth-century nationalist folklorists.\\" He goes on to note that Behringer's \\"patient dissection of [the folklorists'] sleights of hand is one of the many delights of the book, but another is his vivid and moving evocation of the social, economic, and political realities of the early modern Alpine world and his tone of solidarity with the victims and their class (for example, automatically supplying the birth and death dates of even the humblest bit-players in his story).\\" Jonhson notes that Shamans of Oberstdorf inevitably \\"invites comparison with the modern classics of Carlo Ginzburg, particularly The Night Battles (1983) and Ecstasies (1990)\\", with the two historians dealing with a clear \\"material overlap\\", but nonetheless Johnson believes that the two \\"employ radically different methodoligies.\\" Praising Midelfort's English language translation, Johnson believed that it was a \\"tribute to Behringer's fascinating book\\" that it left the reader yearning \\"to know more\\", particularly about \\"how the social, economic, political and religious tensions evident in this region, as elsewhere, in the post-Reformation period affected relationships between the living and the dead generally.\\"Johnson 2001 Wider influence The French Medievalist Claude Lecouteux highlighted Behringer's book in the preface to the 1996 edition of his book Witches, Werewolves and Fairies: Shapeshifters and Astral Doubles in the Middle Ages. Arguing that Behringer's findings supported his own theories regarding the concept of the double, he lamented however that Behringer seemed \\"completely unfamiliar\\" with such a theory.Lecouteux 2003 [1996]. p. xvii.

The film was first shown in 2010 at single locations in the United States. It was released on Video on demand (VOD) on 26 December 2011, and on general theatrical release in January 2012. The film was made in upper New York state by 5 Minutes Productions, and distributed by Tribeca Film. Plot A band, consisting of leader Nick (Matt Sbeglia), Anton (Casey Smith), Johnny (Soomin Lee), Carlo (Jorgen Jorgensen) and the blind Robbie (Nick Thorp) decide to go camping in the woods to write five new songs. Upon arriving, they discover a sign reading (Don't Go in the Woods), however they ignore it and set up camp in a nearby clearing. While Nick and Carlo are collecting firewood, they find a hunting cabin that is full of weapons including a sledgehammer, however they ignore it and decide to break the group's cellphones to help with the creative process. Meanwhile, the band's manager Carson (Bo Boddie) arrives at the woods. While he tries to find the campsite he is attacked and killed. As night falls, the group begin to, successfully, write new songs for their album. Nick tells the legend of a group of warriors who became stranded in the woods and resorted to cannibalism, with ultimately only one surviving. Soon after the band are joined by a group of their female friends including Nick's ex-girlfriend Ashley (Cassandra Lee Walker), Johnny's girlfriend Callie (Kate O'Malley), Melinda (Ali Tobia) and her foreign friend Sophie (Nuriya Aimaya) who speaks little English, Felicity (Gwynn Galitzen) and best friends Charlotte (Kira Gorelick) and Georgia (Alyssa Jang). While the rest of the band are happy to be joined, Nick is upset, knowing the group will become distracted from their songwriting. As the group drink and enjoy themselves, Charlotte becomes upset with Carlo's flirting and angrily leaves to go and stay in a motel. Georgia follows Charlotte and the pair wander back to the cars. As Charlotte gets in the driving seat, a sledgehammer begins to smash through the windscreen, with Georgia's severed arm being flung onto the hood. As Charlotte attempts to drive away, the window is smashed open and she is attacked. The following morning, Nick wakes everyone up early, determined to get the girls to leave. Anton offers to walk the girls to the van, however upon arriving they find the battery dead and are forced to return to the camp. During the day, Nick and Ashley briefly reconcile after their recent break-up, but Nick decides to spend the day writing alone, annoyed at the band's lack of focus. At night, the band continue to write new music. Nick takes all of the girls cellphones and breaks them, despite their protests. While Anton is performing a song he wrote he becomes upset and leaves, angering Nick. Felicity decides to search for Anton, but she is brutally hit and killed with a sledgehammer. Johnny and Callie also leave the campsite to make out, and are beaten to death. The following day Melinda and Sophie go on a walk by the river. As Melinda helps Sophie improve her English, the killer arrives and drags Melinda away, eventually killing her. Sophie rushes back to the campsite to warn the others, but can not due to the language barrier, only confusing the others. The killer arrives again and kills Sophie, Carlo and Robbie. Meanwhile, Ashley runs into Nick as she is trying to escape the woods. However, Nick begins to play a song with his guitar instead of running. Ashley then notices blood all over Nick's hands, and realizes he is the killer. Ashley runs away and discovers Anton impaled through the neck. Nick catches up with her and cuts her back open, leaving her to die. As the movie ends, a record producer (Eric Bogosian) congratulates Nick on his album, titled Don't Go in the Woods, telling him it was a good idea to \\"get rid of the band\\". Cast Production The film was shot on two cameras in woods on D'Onofrio's land in Woodstock, New York state. D'Onofrio decided to make the film during a waiting period for another project to go ahead; he said \\"My friends and I were in the middle of another project, waiting for the rights for that, and it was taking too long.\\" Filming started two months after the initial idea, took twelve days to shoot, and was completed for a budget of $100,000. The film is D'Onofrio's feature length directorial debut. During an interview with Patrick McDonald of hollywoodchicago.com, he was asked how directors he had worked with influenced him; D'Onofrio said that great directors stuck with their original idea and were not sidetracked. McDonald asked him \\"How did you honor those impressions,\\" to which he replied, \\"I don‚Äôt know if I actually did that on my set. I used the script as a blueprint, we purposely wrote this 'B-movie' structure, and made it into a musical. Basically that was the plan, and that is what we achieved.\\" In an interview with Edward Douglas of Shocktillyoudrop.net, D'Onofrio spoke of how the film's genre was intended as a slasher musical, and that he had wanted to \\"make an absurd slasher musical\\". He went on to discuss how the casting was done \\"off the street [...] some of the girls worked in a coffee shop around the corner from my house\\". He did say that \\"three of the guys were in a band, the Dirty Dirty\\" and had recorded music together prior to the film. He also talked about how it was \\"difficult to keep tension [of a horror film] going\\" while interspersing it with musical numbers, \\"as singing releases on-screen tension.\\" D'Onofrio also said that the film's title was not a reference to the same-named 1981 film. Reception Critical reception has been mostly negative. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 13% with 7 of the 8 reviews being negative.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dont_go_in_the_woods_2011 Kristen McCracken of Huffington Post Entertainment, described it as \\"a fun ride, with the loose feel of a campy B-horror-movie from decades past (the difference here is that Bisbee‚Äôs music is good), with twists and turns and jumps galore\\". Dustin Putman said that, although it \\"probably shouldn't work‚Äîor, at least, what ought to come off as campy‚Äîavoids such pitfalls\\", the film \\"is made in grand spirits and with undeniable know-how. It's conventional and truly one- of-a-kind all at once. There's nothing else out there like it.\\" Michelle Orange of Movieline.com said \\"Though obviously aware of the potential and prepared to really go for it, D‚ÄôOnofrio came up with something that feels unfinished -- an interesting harmony that needs a better bridge.\\" Most critical was Nick Pinkerton, of the Village Voice, who said that the cast are \\"no great shakes as actors\\", going on to say that the film \\"is cozily resigned to its novelty niche but an affront to fans of the genres it bowdlerizes.\\" References External links * Don't Go in the Woods page on the Tribeca Films website * Interview with D'Onofrio for Shocktillyoudrop.com  Category:2010 films Category:2010 horror films Category:2010s musical films Category:American slasher films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:American musical films Category:Backwoods slasher films ","title":"Don't Go in the Woods (2010 film)"},{"id":"34358043","text":"Mariyannapalya is a village near Hebbal in northern Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

Chew Your Own Brooch In 1998 Noten developed an ongoing project called Chew Your Own Brooch. It was first explored at the Rotterdam art museum Boijmans van Beuningen. Appr. 800 visitors, including many children, were given a piece of chewing gum and asked to \\"chew their own brooch\\". Once they were satisfied with the shape they had produced, the piece was put in a little box, marked, and judged by a panel. First, second and third-place winners were then presented with their brooches, made of their own piece of chewing gum cast respectively in 24K gold, silver and bronze. For many years now Noten has provided clients with their own chewing kit. When the client is satisfied with the shape they produced the piece of gum is returned and a replica brooch is made cast in silver or gold. Wearable Gold Wearable Gold a.k.a. Object (2001) consists of a pair of inconspicuous black and white sling back shoes with 24K gold insoles, allowing the wearer to walk on gold without attracting too much attention, as well as providing security in less fortunate times. Noten got inspired when he met a stranger on a train, a Jewish man who spoke of the horrors of being in Auschwitz during the Second World War, and about money, poverty and death. The man explained that gold and diamonds were the only real currency and that he still carried gold inside his shoes for security against the next rainy day. Wearable Gold 2 are 24K gold glazed porcelain pendants that are much less inconspicuous and only serve to impress the onlooker as the real value in gold is limited. A similar concept, but now in silver, is Noten's N.T. 2011, a 5 kg 999/1000 silver bar one can carry around by its handle and shoulder strap. In a limited edition of 3 pieces. I Am Being Nice to My Colleagues Noten's design I Am Being Nice to My Colleagues (2001) consists of an A4 silver plate that is blank except for two indented concentric circles. This first ring is ready to wear. When the buyer wishes to have a new ring made, they can commission another designer to create another ring from the plate. Eventually only the silhouettes of previous rings will be left. Noten invites other designers to share his concept and create their own work within the concept's parameters. Mercedes Brooch The Mercedes Brooch is made from steel parts cut from the body of a Mercedes-Benz E-Class 210 model luxury car. Noten started this project in 2001 with his work 100 Pieces in which he took a section of a new car and divided it into 100 fragments, each unique in size and form. That way the brooch wearer could become part owner of a new Mercedes-Benz. Noten followed it up in 2003 with a different car. In 2007 and 2008 he just used the hood. The 2001 brooches are white, the 2003 red. Priced at ‚Ç¨200.00 a piece. A Tiara for Maxima In 2002, Noten participated among 40 (21 in final) Dutch artists and designers in a tiara design competition honouring the marriage between Maxima Zorreguieta and the Dutch crown prince Willem-Alexander. Noten's design of a shiny chromed polo helmet with a clip-on tiara won first prize. The jury referred to it as a 'cheeky' design. Noten intended the tiara, with small portraits of all Dutch queens positioned as guardian angels on top, to be used in church during the wedding ceremony. Afterwards the princess could combine the tiara with the helmet to protect herself against paparazzi when she ventured into the city of Amsterdam (or if she felt confident enough her husband might want to wear the helmet). The Pistol Saints The use of guns in Noten's work came about by chance. In the past Noten had felt uneasy about the large number of people in his neighbourhood that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection and he thought he might just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art. Noten's work The Pistol Saints (2003) is part of the Design Against Crime project. Whenever Noten asked people why they carried a gun they said it made them feel more secure, although most of them never actually used their gun. This inspired him to copy what he called the soul of the gun in pieces of jewellery the owner could wear instead of the gun. The Pistol Saints consists of twelve golden brooches with imprints of a gun. On the brooches the gun markings can be clearly distinguished. The Pistol Saints received wide public attention when it was displayed at the 2004 exhibition on contemporary jewellery Geel metalliek: Goud voor Robert Smit at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. This was because Noten not only then displayed the golden brooches but also, as part of the artwork, the gun he used to make the imprints with. As he had no official licence for this gun it was confiscated by the police and destroyed. Though unintended, the police action of removing the gun from the exhibition but leaving the brooches with the gun markings, contributed to the meaning of the work. Mr Claw At art exhibitions the visitor usually is not allowed to touch the displayed objects, not even when they clearly have a functional background like an artistic chair or jewellery. Therefore, Noten used a funfair machine he called Mr Claw to offer visitors the opportunity to actually touch works of art. Mr Claw contains plastic bubbles with small pieces of jewellery inside the visitor can attempt to grab by using the machine's remote-controlled grabber. As a special attraction Noten put a 1 kg silver bar inside as well (unfortunately this item is too heavy to be lifted by the grabber). Mr Claw was used at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam Geel metalliek: Goud voor Robert Smit exhibition on contemporary jewellery in 2004, and at the Icon Experiment 2008 exhibition in London, UK. Unstaged At a 2004 exhibition at the Amsterdam art society Arti & Amicitiae Noten used an installation with an industrial robot to show his Paperheadring that contained a tiny paper hat cast in acrylic. In the 2011 project Lady Killer Vol. 1 the concept of an automated jewellery box was further explored. Golden Piles In 2004, Noten collected a large amount of low-price earthenware crockery from a Dutch budget store. He arranged the crockery in piles, fixed the design and had it gold-plated as a contrast. These unique objects he called Golden Piles or Festive Table Centers. Golden Pile 9 (2004) is a stack of plates that is in the Rotterdam Museum Boijmans van Beuningen collection. Global Tactile Pieces Vol. II On Noten's 2004 trip from Tokyo to Amsterdam he purchased, found or swapped objects that he afterwards transformed into jewelry designs that represented cities he visited, experiences he had, and people he met. In total 16 different works, i.e. the Chinese city of Tianjin is represented by a necklace with a large red drill. The Mongolian city of Erenhot is represented by a pendant that is now in the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art collection. St. James Cross Revisited In 2005, visitors to the National Museum of Ancient Art in Lisbon, Portugal, which houses ancient art treasures from around the world, would receive a special brooch Noten designed by using the emblem of the Order of Saint James of the Sword, a famous Portuguese Order of Chivalry. Then the visitors were invited to make a picture or portrait with the brooch in their hometown and place this image on a dedicated website. That way a special bond would be created between the worldwide visitors' community and the museum. The Real Love Bracelet In 2005, Noten commented on Cartier's iconic Love Bracelet, that can only be unlocked by the partner, by producing The Real Love Bracelet, a silver bracelet attached to a blown glass bubble with a pair of rings inside. That way the wearer always has a pair of rings handy and only needs to break the bubble when the right moment has arrived. Wedding Pills As an alternative to traditional wedding rings, Noten designed a pair of golden Wedding Pills (2007). These are micro- inscribed with the names of the couple and the date of their wedding, and are to be swallowed during the marriage ceremony. Later they can be recovered from their journey through the body, and reused as a recurring ritual to strengthen the couple's bond after a marriage crisis. Be nice to a girl, buy her a ring In 2008 the city of Amsterdam started a project to improve the red light district in the old city centre. Noten participated with a street vending machine that sold red rings with a wide variety of designs for only ‚Ç¨2.50. The rings were intended to be bought for the neighbourhood prostitutes by their clients. Noten called the project Be nice to a girl, buy her a ring and hoped it would improve the mutual respect between prostitutes and clients, and that it might even introduce a more romantic atmosphere in the red light district. Afterwards he offered the red rings, cased and numbered in a limited edition of 250 pieces, as true art objects for ‚Ç¨310.00 each. Messin' around with Willy For the 2008 exhibition LINGAM - 121 contemporary fertility symbols artists, designers and jewellery makers from 24 countries were asked to create new lingam objects based on the ancient fertility symbol. Noten contributed with a series of porcelain dildos with miniature objects attached, i.e. a car pulling a caravan and a highway lamppost. A white porcelain dildo with miniature Delftware attached is priced at ‚Ç¨3,000.00. Periscope In 2008 Atelier Ted Noten provided the renovated Rotterdam art museum Boijmans van Beuningen with a multimedia installation. It consists of a golden mobile, called Periscope, positioned in the museum's lobby. The museum's new entrance ticket is a letter that the visitor can use to display an image of an item from the museum's collection on one of the walls of the lobby. The letter changes daily, the text and images projected from Periscope change equally. TEDWALK On November 23, 2008, Noten was awarded with the Francoise van den Bosch award, an international prize for innovative jewellery makers, and he combined the award ceremony with a catwalk presentation of highlights from his work since 1995 for the opening of a solo-exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum 's-Hertogenbosch. The Revenge of the Pearl Necklace In 2009, during the fashion exhibition Gejaagd door de wind (Gone with the wind) at the Zuiderzeemuseum in Enkhuizen, Noten showed his work The Revenge of the Pearl Necklace consisting of the decomposing body of a pike that gradually exposed a pearl necklace Noten had put inside the stomach of the fish. Visitors were overwhelmed by the smell. Later during the exhibition Noten showed a video of the decomposing process together with the pike's cleaned skeleton and the necklace itself. With The Revenge Noten is referring to the Zuiderzee fishermen's loathing of pearls as these were very popular with the nobility. Haunted by 36 Women In 2009, Noten started, inspired by a card of Japanese artist Hokusai Katsushika (1760‚Äì1849), his ongoing Haunted by 36 Women project. Like Hokusai who created 36 drawings from the mountain he loved, Noten chose 36 archetypes of women to design jewellery for. First, a life-size sculpture is constructed, which is then transformed into a wearable art object, made out of different materials like nylon, stainless steel, titanium, silver or gold. So far Noten has created, among others, Career Woman (a limited edition of three pieces 18K gold-plated ring decorated with a miniature office chair combined with the saddle of a racing bicycle), Iron Lady (a ring with an iPod), Femme Fatale (a ring with a miniature fencing foil attached, flexible by the use of rubber-filled nylon and priced at ‚Ç¨225.00, also in the Stedelijk Museum 's-Hertogenbosch collection), Macha (a ring with a machinegun), Ice-cream girl (a ring and a bracelet with a pair of pointed stiletto shoes on a car tire), Chocolate Hooker (a ring with a serving dish filled with chocolates and priced at ‚Ç¨150.00) and Kenau (a ring with a purse and a pair of boxing gloves). Fashionista necklace in green (2009). The limited edition of eight pieces of the Fashionista 3D-printed glass-filled nylon necklace with miniature stiletto shoes is part of the project. The nylon necklace is priced at ‚Ç¨1,400.00. Noten also produced a limited edition of ten unique pieces, each with a different gold element, called Fashionista Golden Girl. In addition a single edition necklace with all gold elements was made and a single edition all gold piece. Noten also produced the lacquered nylon Suffragette ring, priced at ‚Ç¨950.00, and the 18K gold Muse ring priced at ‚Ç¨18,500.00. The Mom brooch, of laser sintered nylon, is priced at ‚Ç¨175.00. A special design is Avondvlinder (translated Evening butterfly, another expression for prostitute) a.k.a. Miss Piggy (a ring with on top a piglet with a pearl necklace) that is produced in gold and titanium, as well as in nylon. It is based on Noten's 2008 Pig Bracelet made of sintered nylon. The Pig Bracelet is priced at ‚Ç¨1,800.00 and the Avondvlinder (Miss Piggy) ring at appr. ‚Ç¨13,000.00 (18K gold and depending on gold price), or ‚Ç¨925.00 (titanium), or ‚Ç¨80.00 (glassfiber-filled nylon). Last Cigarette Since 2010 Ted Noten offers people who have quit smoking a reminder as well as moral support by making a brooch from their last cigarette. These unique brooches are 18K gold-plated and priced at ‚Ç¨850.00. Vertical Rainbow In 2010, Atelier Ted Noten participated in the exhibition Contemplating the Void that marked the 50th anniversary of the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. The museum asked for designs that would provide the visitor with an inspiring view of the large central atrium of the Guggenheim building. ATN suggested an installation design that made use of a sparkling curtain of Swarovski crystals falling from the ceiling. A special projector light on the crystals would then generate a vertical rainbow of colours across the atrium. Three Stars Bomb ! At first glance the Three Stars Bomb! looks like a classic bomb with long wick. But once ignited it appears to be a candle that gradually displays three bronze stars that can be worn as brooches (i.e. to imitate a three-star rank). Comes with the Swedish Three Stars Safety Matches that inspired Noten to make this design. Displayed during Milan Design Week 2010 and now in the Centraal Museum Utrecht collection. Priced at ‚Ç¨39.95. The Temptation In 2010, Noten designed a life-size apple with a golden stem, topped with a small black diamond, called De Verleiding (The Temptation). The golden stem with diamond is in fact a brooch and the apple serves as a decorative stand for when the brooch is not worn. In a yellow and a black 3D-printed limited edition of ten pieces it is priced at ‚Ç¨1,200.00. Wanna Swap Your Ring ? During the Tokyo Design Week of September 2010 Noten participated in the exhibition Catalysis for Life - New Language of Dutch Art & Design at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo (MOT) in Japan. He arranged 500 of his Miss Piggy rings in the shape of his gun icon on a wall to offer the visitors an interactive art installation he called Wanna Swap Your Ring ?. Many visitors then used the opportunity to swap their own ring for a Noten ring, leaving a genuine jungle of rings behind. Noten commented he did not know what to do with these visitors' rings yet but that he would surely find a purpose for them. Given the success he plans to use the Wanna Swap Your Ring installation at art exhibitions worldwide. SLOW - Eleven Women and 400 Daisies To celebrate the opening of the Mint Museum Uptown, the Mint Museum of Craft+Design, Charlotte, US, launched Project Ten Ten Ten on October 1, 2010. Ten innovative international artists in the fields of glass, jewelry, furniture and fiber art where commissioned, including Ted Noten, to create exclusive works for the permanent collection of the museum. Noten developed an interactive piece called SLOW - Eleven Women and 400 Daisies as an homage to the Mint Museum's Auxiliary women, as well as to all American women. SLOW consists of a golden buste, with the features of ten famous American women, that is completely covered with white 3D-printed nylon daisies. The daisies double as brooches and every new Auxiliary member will be given one to wear. That way it will take appr. 18 years before the entire buste is revealed (hence the title SLOW). Pig Head Trophy Each year the Design Academy Eindhoven commissions an artist to design a trophy for the academy's graduates. For the 2010 edition Noten worked with Amsterdam-based 3D-printing company Freedom Of Creation (FOC) to create his Pig Head Trophy, consisting of a sliced pig head with one slice per graduate. Not only was each and every slice different, they were also customized to show which course the student took. Dutch Fashion Awards In 2010 and 2011 Atelier Ted Noten teamed up with Amsterdam-based 3D-printing company Freedom Of Creation (FOC) to create the Dutch Fashion Awards. These designs consist of 3D-printed necklaces that represent each of the six prize categories. Matching badges for jury officials were also made. Special attention was given to the Mercedes sponsored award that incorporates the Mercedes star. The 2010 awards are yellow, the 2011 are red. Art Rehab In 2011, Noten used the large taxi driver community of the UK industrial city of Middlesbrough to promote the exhibition The Modern Jewel - In time and the mind of others at MIMA, the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art. He thought of working with taxi drivers after seeing the landmark bridge in the area, the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge, that was celebrating its centenary. The transporter bridge operates very much like a ferry and during the lengthy crossing taxi drivers usually have nothing much else to do than to talk to their passenger(s). Noten started the project with interviews, asking the taxi drivers how they felt about art, what they knew about MIMA and what they would like him, as an artist, to create for their cars. He received answers like 'I used to wear a ring for good luck', 'would like a girl on the hood', and 'I'm too busy for art'. These, sometimes puzzling, quotes were used on posters announcing the exhibition throughout the city. Then Noten provided 300 taxi drivers with a little brooch and a slightly larger object, both the shape of a wing (referring to the godly messenger Hermes). The winged brooch was attached to the driver's jacket and the larger wing to the dashboard, functioning as a conversation piece to trigger the curiosity of customers. If the driver felt no inclination to talk about MIMA, he could use a CD to inform an inquisitive customer during the drive. Finally, the taxi driver would provide the customer with a flyer about the exhibition with a Post-it sticker in the shape of a wing. The flyer invited the customer to write down their opinion of the exhibition on the sticker and paste it to a wall at MIMA. This wall eventually became an artwork itself, with the stickers positioned as feathers within the contours of a drawing of a large wing. The Hermes-flyers were also available at other places in town, such as waiting rooms of doctors, libraries, the town hall, etcetera. The flyer also entitled a visitor of the exhibition to a 40% discount on a winged Noten ring. Lady Killer Vol. 1 In 2011, Atelier Ted Noten and UK creative company Laikingland designed a modern-day jewellery box called Lady Killer Vol. 1. It is made by 3D printing techniques and comprises a robotic arm that grabs and presents a single piece of stored jewellery. The gold-plated Lady Killer ring designed for this project has on top a miniature gun with a white and a black diamond. Chanel 001 gun bag in black (2011). 7 Necessities for a Woman In 2011, Noten also designed a white Dior 001 gun and a black Chanel 001 gun with hand-tooled 18-karat gold details, as part of a larger series entitled 7 Necessities for a Woman (to feel like a woman through the eyes of a man). The two 3D-printed nylon guns double as make-up bags with lip gloss and wand in the muzzle, the loading chamber serves as a pill compartment (complete with pills, including Viagra), 100 grams of certified silver bullion in the Dior gun clip, 50 grams of 24-karat gold in the Chanel, a toothpick and, in some models, a hairpin and a small vial of perfume. The guns also conceal a 4-gigabyte USB memory stick. Priced at US$11,500.00 (Dior gun) and over US$17,000.00 (Chanel gun) respectively. Smartphone Jewels Noten developed his Smartphone Jewels project as part of the contemporary jewelry exhibition Unleashed! held at the Dutch Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem (MMKA) in Arnhem from November 4, 2011 until February 6, 2012. The exhibition is advertised throughout the Arnhem city center with posters that each carry a different QR-tag to be scanned by a smartphone. Each tag provides the smartphone user with additional information on jewelry related topics, i.e. the price of gold or political commentary on blood diamonds or a story about miners. When all tags are scanned the smartphone user receives an individual code that can be exchanged for a 3D-printed Noten gunring at the exhibition. Noten also designed a special 3D-printed glassfiber-filled nylon smartphone (iPhone) cover with daisies and a bicolor ring to match priced at ‚Ç¨395.00. Monograph In 2006, Rotterdam- based 010 publishers published Noten's 328-page monograph titled CH2=C(CH3)C(=O)CH3 enclosures and other TN's (). The title refers to the chemical formula of the PMMA material, much used by Noten. Created out of a pile of thousands of photographs, combined with informational as well as poetic text, the book offers compositions, associations, and narratives to illustrate Noten's work. It achieved the Best Dutch Book Design 2006 award. Documentaries In 2007, a half-hour radio interview was aired in which Noten discusses his monograph with Brett Littman, the director of The Drawing Center art museum in New York City. A short video interview was recorded at the Design Miami 2008 exhibition. Noten explains how some of his most famous works came about and that his intuition plays an important role in the creative process. In 2009, the Dutch Design Fashion and Architecture (DutchDFA) group commissioned a short documentary film about Noten as part of their Dutch Profiles series on contemporary architects and graphic, product and fashion designers in the Netherlands. These documentaries are meant to be spread freely over the web and as part of lectures, exhibitions and business presentations. In 2010, a one-hour documentary film called Goud, Zweet & Parels (Gold, Sweat & Pearls) was produced by Dutch director Simone de Vries and broadcast on Dutch television. It portrays Ted Noten, his work and his philosophy: Exhibitions and collections Noten has participated in numerous exhibitions around the world and he is represented by galleries and museum collections worldwide. In 2006, Noten was a keynote speaker at the Society of North American Goldsmiths (SNAG) conference in Chicago. In 2011, Atelier Ted Noten participated in the Glasstress exhibition. Awards In 1998, Noten was awarded the German Herbert Hoffmann Preis. Every year this award is granted to three outstanding jewelry designers who show their work at the Schmuck exhibition in Munich, Germany. Schmuck was established in 1959 by Dr. Herbert Hoffmann and is the eldest exhibition of contemporary jewellery work in the world. Noten's tiara design for Dutch crown princess Maxima won the first prize in 2002. In 2006 his monograph CH2=C(CH3)C(=O)OCH3 and other TN's published by Rotterdam-based publisher 010 won Best Dutch Book Designs. In 2008, Noten received the Dutch Fran√ßoise van den Bosch award, which recognizes an international jeweler whose work embodies exceptional quality and innovation. In 2011 Ted Noten won the Dutch Artist of the Year award.

It was founded by Johan van der Meer and conducted by him until 1984.  History  Johan van der Meer founded the choir in 1945 on a suggestion by Gerardus van der Leeuw. The choir was formed by professional and semi-professional singers. While the great oratorios of Bach were performed by more than 40 singers, only three voices per part sang the six-part St John Passion by Johann Christoph Demantius in 1981. During the first quarter century, the Groningse Bachvereniging presented music of any style and period from the 15th to the 20th century. However, the works of Bach prevailed. In 1947, Bach's motets were performed not a cappella, but with instrumental accompaniment, in Baroque performance tradition. In 1955, the choir received the culture prize of Groningen province.Record liner notes, Bachverenigung zu den Sweelinck-Psalmen (1974). The year 1970 was milestone in the choir's history, when van der Meer devoted himself entirely to Baroque music in historical performance. When the regular orchestra Noordelijk Philharmonic Orchestra was not available for a performance of Bach's Magnificat, van der Meer invited Nikolaus Harnoncourt and his Concentus Musicus Wien to the Netherlands for the first time. In 1973, the choir offered the first historically informed performance in the Netherlands of Bach's St Matthew Passion. The Evangelist was Marius van Altena, the vox Christi was Max van Egmond, the other soloists were three boys from the T√∂lzer Knabenchor, Ren√© Jacobs, Harry Geraerts, Michiel ten Houte de Lange, Frits van Erven Dorens and Harry van der Kamp. Ton Koopman and Bob van Asperen played the organs. The performance was recorded live. In 1975, the choir performed and recorded Bach's Mass in B minor at the Holland Festival; the orchestra was La Petite Bande with concert master Sigiswald Kuijken). In 1979, they performed and recorded Bach's St John Passion in Groningen, again with van Altena as the Evangelist and van Egmond as the vox Christi. The choir also performed vocal compositions of Josquin Desprez, Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck and George Frideric Handel. Van der Meers farewell concert was in 1984, a performance of Handel's Israel in Egypt, with the Fiori Musicali and three trombonists from the Musicalische Compagney. After directing the choir for almost 40 years, van der Meer was succeeded by Rein de Vries. In 1989, the Groningse Bachvereniging became the Capella Groningen.Obituary / discography viertakt.radio4.nl (26 April 2011). Retrieved 27 January 2012.

Near Cottonwood, Idaho the Nez Perce, led by Chief Joseph, brushed aside the soldiers and continued their fighting retreat to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to reach safety in Canada.  Background  After their victory at the Battle of White Bird Canyon the Nez Perce crossed the Salmon River to escape General O. O. Howard, who was advancing on them with 400 soldiers. With difficulty Howard crossed the river to confront the Indians, but the outnumbered Nez Perce then recrossed the Salmon, stranding the less mobile U.S. soldiers for several days on the opposite side of the river. The Nez Perce numbered about 600, of whom 150 were warriors. With them were more than 2,000 livestock, mostly horses.Jacoby, 632. Looking Glass with his band of 100-plus Nez Perce had not joined Joseph as yet. Joseph's Nez Perce would later number about 750. With the guns and ammunition the Nez Perce had captured at White Bird Canyon, they were fairly well-armed. Their objective in the Battle of Cottonwood was \\"to engage the whites only long enough allow the safe passage of their families.\\" The location of the Battle of Cottonwood in Idaho  Battle  After recrossing the Salmon and leaving Howard behind, the Nez Perce headed east across the Camas Prairie, having made the decision to flee into the Bitterroot Mountains. In their path, stationed at Norton's Ranch (future Cottonwood) was Captain Stephen Whipple with 65 soldiers and several civilian volunteers. On July 3, two of Whipple's civilian scouts stumbled across the Nez Perce horse herd. The Nez Perce killed one man but the other escaped and reported that the Nez Perce were nearby. Whipple sent out Lieutenant Sevier Rains with 10 soldiers and two civilians to investigate. The Nez Perce ambushed the Rains group and killed them all.Jacoby, pp. 537-538 Whipple dug in around Norton's ranch with his remaining soldiers. He was reinforced on July 4 by Captain David Perry with 20 soldiers and six civilian volunteers.Jacoby, p. 538 Perry, who had led the soldiers in the White Bird Canyon battle two weeks earlier took command of the soldiers and volunteers, now numbering about 85. For the remainder of the day the soldiers stayed in their rifle pits while the Nez Perce sniped at them from long distance. The next day, July 5, the Nez Perce undertook to bypass the entrenched soldiers, detailing 14 young men to keep the soldiers pinned down in the rifle pits, while the remainder of the Nez Perce and their livestock, screened by warriors, passed by a mile away heading eastward. The soldiers did not contest their passage. A group of 17 civilian volunteers appeared near Cottonwood at this time. They attempted to reach the soldiers by breaking through the Nez Perce screen, but they had to take up a defensive position on a hilltop about one and west of Cottonwood. Three of the volunteers were killed and two wounded. One elderly Nez Perce warrior was killed ‚Äì the first to die in the war ‚Äì and one wounded. Although Captain Perry could see from his fortifications the plight of the volunteers he declined to send help until the Nez Perce had withdrawn. That evening 50 civilian volunteers arrived to reinforce Perry, but the Nez Perce were gone. Casualties for the engagements totaled eleven soldiers and six civilian volunteers dead and several wounded. The Nez Perce suffered one dead and one wounded.Jacoby, pp. 537‚Äì540  Aftermath  Captain Perry was severely criticized for his tardiness in rescuing the civilian volunteers. He requested a Court of Inquiry, which declared that his delay was not \\"excessive under the circumstances.\\"Hampton, p. 103 The civilian volunteers acquired a place in Idaho history as the \\"Brave Seventeen.\\" The Nez Perce continued their journey east unmolested for 25 miles, before pausing to rest at the Clearwater River. The band of Looking Glass and other Nez Perce joined the main group there and brought their strength up to about 800 with about 200 fighting men. A few days later General Howard and a force of more than 500 men caught up with the Nez Perce and the Battle of the Clearwater ensued.Hampton, pp. 125-126 Ten members of Company E and L of the 1st Cavalry killed in this battle are buried at the Fort Walla Walla Cemetery.Payne, James and Schultz, Laura, 2011, An Illustrated History of Fort Walla Walla, Walla Walla, Washington, Fort Walla Walla Museum, p. 19  References  Category:1877 in the United States Cottonwood Category:Idaho Territory Category:1877 in Idaho Territory Category:July 1877 events Cottonwood ","title":"Battle of Cottonwood"},{"id":"34358333","text":"Turbulent Priests is the third novel of the Dan Starkey series by Northern Irish author, Colin Bateman, released on 6 December 1999 through Harper Collins.

She goes on to say that \\"despite its unlikely premise, the book is an engaging, swiftly paced fusion of murder, sex, and religious fundamentalism, loaded with wry one-liners\\". Isobel Montgomery, reviewing for The Guardian, stated that \\"Bateman is an engaging comic writer who has created another snappy adventure for Starkey\\".

It was painted between 1766 and 1770, and is now in the Louvre in Paris. This work is one of a series of twelve paintings representing the Solennit√† dogali (The Doge's Solemnities), in which the artist has faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Giovanni Antonio Canal and engraved by Giambattista Brustolon to commemorate the festivities at the coronation of the Doge Alvise Giovanni Mocenigo in 1763. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, though their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi.C.

Subject This painting and another in the series represent the Festa della Sensa, the most sumptuous of all Venetian festivals. It took place each year on Ascension Day, the anniversary of the setting out of Doge Pietro II Orseolo's expedition which achieved the conquest of Dalmatia in c. 1000. It was also a celebration of the Treaty of Venice of 1177 between the Doge Sebastiano Ziani, Pope Alexander III and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa. In a magnificent state barge known as the Bucentaur (in Italian, Bucintoro), the Doge visited the Lido and celebrated the Marriage of the Sea ceremony of Venice with the Adriatic Sea, by casting a ring into the waters.F.

Another in the series represents the Doge going to hear Mass at San Nicol√≤ al Lido. History This painting entered the Louvre as a result of a confiscation in 1797 of the Count Joseph Fran√ßois Xavier de Pestre de Seneffe 1797's collection. It was selected by the Louvre, with eleven other paintings in the same series, at the H√¥tel de Nesle; it was then sent to the Mus√©um de Toulouse (now a museum of natural history), which subsequently handed it back to the Louvre in exchange for a portrait by Ingres and another painting by Guardi, in 1952.Cf. \\"Francesco Guardi and England\\", The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 82, No. 478 (Jan., 1943), pp. 2‚Äì5 Under the First French Empire, the series was unfortunately broken up: seven remained in the Louvre, one was sent to Brussels, two to Nantes, one to Toulouse and one to Grenoble. The return in 1952 of the Toulouse painting to the Louvre, through the aforementioned exchange, has been the first step in an attempt to reassemble the set and display them in a special room.Henri Loyrette, The Louvre: All the Paintings, Black Dog & Leventhal (2011), s.v. \\"Guardi\\" Today ten paintings of the series are exhibited in the Louvre.Louvre: The Doge on the Bucentaur at San Niccol√≤ del LidoLouvre Atlas database: The Doge on the Bucintoro near the Riva di Sant'Elena Footnotes References *Short Guardi biography in the Web Gallery of Art *G.

Design and development The Hercules was designed as a lightweight single-seat aircraft, with a second seat available to carry an instructor or passenger when required. Because it was intended to be flown solo most of the time it came factory-supplied with a relatively low powered engine, to reduce both the aircraft's cost and weight. Higher powered engines were available if the aircraft was to be used in the training role on a regular basis. In writing about the Hercules, reviewer Andre Cliche explained the engine choice, \\"Because most people usually fly alone in their two-seater, it makes for a well balanced single seater with peppy performance, low fuel burn and longer range. However, when comes the time to carry an occasional passenger, its two-seater capacity far outweighs its anemic performance with two people aboard. This is a smart compromise that gives the best of both worlds.\\" The Hercules was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules when flown as a single-seater, including the category's maximum empty weight of .

Since 2005, Pittet is also the External Lead of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Patient Safety Challenge \\"Clean Care is Safer Care\\" and African Partnerships for Patient Safety. In the 2007 New Year Honours List, Didier Pittet was awarded the Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in recognition of his services related to the prevention of healthcare-associated infections in the UK. Career Pittet graduated in 1976 from the Coll√®ge Calvin secondary school in Geneva, Switzerland. Following a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Community Health at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, he graduated as M.D. in 1983 from the same institution, and received a master's degree (MS) in Epidemiology and Public Health from the University of Iowa, Iowa City, US, in 1992. Pittet began his career as an infectious diseases expert with a special interest in the intensive care setting and device-associated and yeast infections, but this rapidly expanded to include research in overall hospital epidemiology and infection prevention and control. In 1992, he was appointed as Director of the Infection Control Programme at the University Hospital of Geneva and named Professor of Medicine in 2000 by the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine.  Academic and other posts (selected) Pittet is Visiting Professor, Division of Investigative Science and School of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK; Honorary Professor, 1st Medical School of the Fu, Shanghai, China; Honorary Professor, Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, SAR, China. Since 2002, Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) Planning Committee member Since 2011, Co-Chair, 1st International Conference on Prevention and Infection Control (ICPIC)  Landmark research  Initial observation studies in Geneva by Pittet's team showed a low compliance with basic hand hygiene practices and a lack of awareness by healthcare workers that the main cause of cross-transmission of microorganisms is by hands. Time constraint was identified as the major determinant for poor compliance. The challenge was to facilitate hand hygiene for staff and to find an innovative idea to do so. Under Pittet's leadership, the team investigated concepts from the social sciences to help understand the determinants driving healthcare worker behaviour, which led to the creation of a multimodal strategy based on education, recognition of opportunities for hand hygiene, and feedback on performance where the key component was the introduction of alcohol-based hand rub at the point of care to replace handwashing at the sink (\\"system change\\"), thus bypassing the time constraint of the latter method.  \\"The Geneva Hand Hygiene Model\\": a breakthrough intervention  The first multimodal intervention ran from 1995 to 2000 at the University of Geneva Hospitals with a spectacular decrease of almost 50% in hospital-associated infections and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission in parallel with a sustained improvement in compliance with hand hygiene. The methodology and results were published in The Lancet in 2000 and the strategy became known in as \\"The Geneva Hand Hygiene Model\\". During 1995‚Äì1997, Pittet had applied the same multimodal concept to a prevention strategy targeted at vascular access care and showed that it can decrease these infections and substantially impact on the overall incidence of all intensive care unit-acquired infections. Similarly, interventions to reduce urinary tract infections were successfully applied. Pittet's team also proved the cost-effectiveness of their interventions and long-term sustainability. Pittet's vision is that to advance infection prevention and control strategies, it is essential to seek insight and innovation through other specialty fields, such as anthropology or sociology, or even engineering, computer science, mathematical modelling, and systems thinking.  Going global  In 2004, Pittet was approached by the WHO World Alliance of Patient Safety to lead the First Global Patient Safety Challenge under the banner \\"Clean Care is Safer Care\\". The mandate was to galvanise global commitment to tackle health-care associated infection, which had been identified as a significant area of risk for patients in all United Nations Member States. Hand hygiene was to be the cornerstone of the Challenge. As co-author of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for Hand Hygiene, Pittet proposed that WHO Guidelines for Hand Hygiene in Health Care be developed under his leadership in consultation with other international experts. The final version of the Guidelines was published in 2009. In 2008, the infection control programme of the University of Geneva Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine was designated as the first WHO Collaborating Centre for Patient Safety (Infection Control and Improving Practices) in Europe. The \\"Geneva Hand Hygiene Model\\" was used as the basis for the recommended implementation strategy for the global promotion of hand hygiene. As of December 2011, \\"Clean Care is Safer Care\\" has been endorsed by ministers of health in over 120 countries worldwide‚Äïrepresenting a coverage of more than 90% of the world population. Forty-two countries/networks have already started hand hygiene initiatives using the proposed strategy. Alcohol-based hand rub is promoted actively as the new standard of care, including in resource-poor countries. Pittet's team developed the \\"Five Moments\\" concept to explain to healthcare workers the critical moments when hand hygiene must be carried out and this model is currently used worldwide. Save Lives: Clean Your Hands is the Challenge's annual campaign with almost 15,000 hospitals registered from more than 150 countries at the end of December 2011.

He designed and supervised the construction of dozens of bridges, railway lines, ports and other objects in Central and Eastern Europe. He served in the Imperial Russian Army with the rank of Lieutenant General.  Early years  Stanis≈Çaw Kierbed≈∫ was born on 10 March 1810 into a Polish-LithuanianThe Great Encyclopedia of Lithuanians; Stanislovas Kerbedis landowning family (≈ölepowron coat of arms) on the estate of near Panevƒó≈æys. He was a piarist student in Panevƒó≈æys, and in 1826 he graduated from high school in Kaunas. Then, from 1826 to 1828, he studied mathematics and physics at the Imperial University of Vilnius.  Teaching activities  After graduating, he went to Saint Petersburg and in 1831 graduated from the Institute of the Corps of Engineers Communications, where he later lectured in construction and practical mechanics as an assistant professor from 1837 to 1849. From 1834 he lectured on those subjects to classes of officers of the Main School of Engineering. From June 1837 to September 1838 he traveled with Professor Pavel Petrovich Melnikov to many European universities. He visited Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France (including in Paris at the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees), England (with classes at the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Newcastle upon Tyne), Belgium and the Netherlands. After his return he continued his activities as a lecturer at the Institute of Mining, the Warsaw School of Engineers in the Field, and in the School of the Marine Corps. From 1841 to 1843 he taught general mechanics at the University of St. Petersburg. As a result, he had more and more involvement in the practical use of this knowledge, and mainly stopped teaching in 1849.  Practical activities  Under his leadership, work on the St. Stanislaus's Catholic Church in St. Petersburg was performed. Kierbed≈∫ also worked at the time as an assistant to Professor Melnikov, who was Director of Railways. The construction of the Kierbed≈∫ Bridge in Warsaw in 1862 The cast iron bridge over the Neva river in 1900 In 1842 he came up with the idea to build an iron bridge over the Neva River. The project was risky because of the construction conditions: a 12 meter deep river, with a strong current, ice floes in the winter, tidal waters, as well as the need to keep the river available for ships. Experts doubted at the time whether it is possible to build any bridge over the capricious river. The decision to entrust its construction to Kierbed≈∫ was taken by Tsar Nicholas I directly. Construction took 8 years and St. Petersburg gained a bridge 342 meters long, 20 meters wide, made of cast-iron with seven fixed spans and one drawbridge. It was named the Blagoveshchensky Bridge (later renamed Nikolaevsky Bridge after Tsar Nicolas's death).St. Petersburg Encyclopedia (online), entry \\"Kerbedz S.V.\\" http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804007625?lc=en On the opening day of the bridge, on 6 (18) November 1850, Kierbed≈∫ was awarded a specially stamped medal and promoted General-Mayor (Major-General). In 1852 he became deputy chief of construction of the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìWarsaw Railway and went abroad in order to familiarize himself with new technologies and ways of building iron bridges, to help build the new railway. He visited England, Germany, Austria and Belgium. He soon made use of this knowledge, building his first truss bridge with a span length of 55 meters over the Luga River from 1853-1857. Kierbed≈∫ was chief of construction in 1856-57 of the St. Petersburg-Peterhof Railway, which was opened for service on 15 (21) July 1857. He was awarded the Order of St. Stanislav, 1st Class, in 1855 and the order of the Red Eagle, 2nd Class, in December 1857. From 1858 Kierbed≈∫ was a member of the Head Council of Railways and Public Buildings Direction. On 17 (29) December 1858 he was made an honorary member of the Imperial St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In 1859 he started the construction of a permanent iron bridge (the first) over the Vistula River in Warsaw. Stanislaw Kierbed≈∫ was deputy head of technical matters on the Bridge Construction Board along with General-Adjutant Count Paul Demetrius Kotzebue. The bridge was completed in 1864 and officially given the name \\"Alexander Bridge\\" (after the reigning Tsar), but was commonly known as the Kierbedzia Bridge. Caissons were used to build the pillars for the bridge which was an unusual construction technique at the time. In recognition of his achievement, he was decorated with the Order of St. Vladimir, 2nd Class, on 18 (30) December 1864. Senior engineer Kierbed≈∫ was promoted General-Leytenant (Lieutenant-General) in 1868 and given the civil rank of Privy Councillor (equivalent to German Geheimrat). In 1872 he was chief engineer of port construction in Kronstadt, including the ship channel to St. Petersburg. The tomb of Stanis≈Çaw Kierbed≈∫, daughter Eugenia and son-in-law Stanislaw in PowƒÖzki Cemetery, Warsaw In 1881 he was appointed to the civil rank of Active Privy Councillor. He was named chairman of the Administration Department of the Ministry of Transport in July 1884, and his civil rank allowed him to substitute repeatedly as Minister of Transport (from 1886 to 1887) during the absences of Konstantin Posyet from the capital. In October 1887 he was transferred to the chairmanship of the Technical Department of the Ministry of Transport. After many years of work, in 1889 he was decorated with the Order of St. Vladimir, 1st Class, and awarded honorary memberships in: * The Institute of Communications Engineers in St. Petersburg, which also funded three scholarships in his name * The Communication Engineers Association, which established the prize named after him, awarded every three years for the best technical articles A scholarship in his name was also funded by the Warsaw University of Technology. He retired due to ill health on 28 July (9 August) 1891. Kierbed≈∫ settled permanently in Warsaw, where he died on 7 (19) April 1899. He is buried in the PowƒÖzki Cemetery.

The comic was launched on 7 January 2012 with a preview issue which was released in late 2011. The comic is often considered a successor to The DFC: both are published by the same people and many of The Phoenix's creators had worked on The DFC. Content of the comic Unlike other British children's comics, such as The Beano and The Dandy, the comic does not exclusively feature humour strips. It also features serialise adventure stories such as \\"The Lost Boy\\" and \\"Pirates of Pangaea\\", as well as humour strips such as \\"Star Cat\\", \\"Evil Emperor Penguin\\", \\"Looshkin\\" and \\"Bunny vs Monkey\\". The comic has also featured text stories (such as extracts from books like \\"Charlie Small\\" and \\"Julius Zebra\\") and puzzles (which are also present in both the modern Beano and Dandy). This makes the comic more similar to the older Beano and Dandy than the modern ones as they once had a mixture of adventure and humour strips as well as text stories. There is also a non-fiction strip called \\"Corpse Talk\\" where the creator Adam Murphy digs up a famous dead person and interviews them about their life. Strips Like a number of comics (2000AD has Tharg the Mighty and Sparky had the Sparky People), The Phoenix features a fictional editorial team, a group of cartoon animals led by feline editor-in-chief Tabitha Inkspot. The main news reporters that are Bruno Barker, Ellie Waggins, Scoop Yapski and Iris Hasselblad, who have a big news page where they report on new comics and other information of note. The other strips include: *Bunny Vs Monkey - A strip about the adventures of anthropomorphic woodland animals, centred around a long- suffering bunny and a mischievous monkey. *Tamsin And The Days - A recurring strip starring Tamsin, an unknowingly magical girl who is the last pellar, a chosen one to save the world from darkness. *Troy Trailblazer (Now Trailblazers) - A recurring sci-fi adventure comic strip starring a team of space heroes led by Troy, their cocky but brave captain. *'Gary's Ga - A strip about a garden and the whimsical animals and plants in it. *Star Cat - A sci- fi strip about a spaceship crew who live inside an interstellar cat. *Corpse Talk - A spoof talk show comic by Adam Murphy looking at influential historical people such as Einstein, Boudicca, etc. by digging up their skeletons. *Evil Emperor Penguin - A comic about a penguin and his plans for world domination. *Mega Robo Bros - A comic by Neill Cameron about two robot brothers on a distant future Earth. *Squid Squad - An underwater adventure strip featuring a team of 3 squids protecting the ocean. *Squid Bits - A simple strip of unrelated short cartoons. *Looshkin - The adventures of \\"the maddest cat in the world.

Conceptualization Sometimes referred to as the Fisher‚ÄìOrr model, Fisher's model addresses the problem of adaptation (and, to some extent, complexity), and continues to be a point of reference in contemporary research on the genetic and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy. The model has two forms, a geometric formalism, and a microscope analogy. A microscope which has many knobs to adjust the lenses to obtain a sharp image has little chance of obtaining an optimally functioning image by randomly turning the knobs. The chances of a clear image are not so bad if the number of knobs is low, but the chances will decrease dramatically if the number of adjustable parameters (knobs) is larger than two or three. Fisher introduced a geometric metaphor, which eventually became known as Fisher's geometric model. In his model, Fisher argues that the functioning of the microscope is analogous to the fitness of an organism. The performance of the microscope depends on the state of various knobs that can be manipulated, corresponding to distances and orientations of various lenses, whereas the fitness of an organism depends on the state of various phenotypic character such as body size and beak length and depth. The increase in the fitness of an organism by random changes is then analogous to the attempt to improve the performance of a microscope through randomly changing the positions of the knobs on the microscope. The analogy between the microscope and an evolving organism can be formalized by representing the phenotype of an organism as a point in a high-dimensional data space, where the dimensions of that space correspond to the traits of the organism. The more independent dimensions of variation the phenotype has, the more difficult is improvement resulting from random changes. If there are many different ways to change a phenotype it becomes very unlikely that a random change affects the right combination of traits in the right way to improve fitness. Fisher noted that the smaller the effect, the higher the chance that a change is beneficial. At one extreme, changes with infinitesimally small effect have a 50% chance of improving fitness. This argument led to the widely held position that evolution proceeds by small mutations. Furthermore, Orr discovered that both the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation and the fitness gain that is conferred by the fixation of the beneficial mutation decrease with organismal complexity. Thus, the predicted rate of adaptation decreases quickly with the rise in organismal complexity, a theoretical finding known as the ‚Äòcost of complexity‚Äô.

Section 4 allows courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility where it is impossible to use section 3 to interpret primary or subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which are also part of the Human Rights Act. In these cases, interpretation to comply may conflict with legislative intent. It is considered a measure of last resort. A range of superior courts can issue a declaration of incompatibility. A declaration of incompatibility is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made, nor can a declaration invalidate legislation. Section 4 therefore achieves its aim through political rather than legal means, including through Section 10 which allows the government to amend legislation without full legislative approval. A remedial order can only be made after a declaration of incompatibility or a similar finding of a European court with all appeals must have been complete or expressly renounced. Parliament has used Section 10 to make small adjustments where possible to bring legislation into line with Convention rights although entirely new pieces of legislation are sometimes necessary.  Context  Human rights are rights taken to be universal, of considerable importance, and relate to the individual and not collectively; among other things, they can grant freedoms, claims, immunities and powers. The European Convention on Human Rights was drawn up in the wake of the Second World War to uphold such rights. The United Kingdom ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1951, and accepted the right of individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg, in 1966. The Human Rights Act 1998 made most Convention rights directly enforceable in a British court for the first time. Excluded are Articles 1 and 13, which the government argued were fulfilled by the Act itself, and therefore were not relevant to rights enforced under it. The Human Rights Act has had a considerable effect on British law, and remains an Act of \\"fundamental constitutional importance\\".  Provisions  Section 4 allows a court to make a \\"declaration of incompatibility\\" if it is \\"satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right\\". Section 3 requires that courts interpret legislation as compatible with Convention rights wherever possible. Lord Steyn has described a declaration of incompatibility was a \\"measure of last resort\\". However, In re S established that there may be cases where interpretation can go too far; that the court can assume an administrative power it would not ordinarily have, with practical consequences that it is not best placed to consider: \\"a meaning which departs substantially from a fundamental feature of an Act of Parliament is likely to have crossed the boundary between interpretation and amendment.\\" The \\"thrust\\" of a statute is important; going against the \\"thrust\\" requires legislative power that the courts do not have. As in R (Anderson) v Home Secretary, a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Act may be the only appropriate remedy. The United Kingdom recognises parliamentary sovereignty. The legislature is above the courts, and the courts cannot therefore declare legislation invalid. Section 4 reflects this, and states that courts must continue to apply legislation, even if incompatible with Convention rights. Section 4(6)(a) notes that a declaration of incompatibility \\"does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it is given\\", which is similar to Section 3(2)(b). R v Lyons confirmed that evidence could be used, even where incompatible with Convention rights, if it was expressly allowed under statute. A declaration of incompatibility is merely a flag that alerts Parliament that people's human rights are being infringed. Accordingly, it has no more legal effect than the fact of incompatible. Section 4(4) allows the court to issue a declaration of incompatibility if altering secondary legislation is impossible because it would necessarily conflict with a statute. Following amendment by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the Armed Forces Act 2006 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005, courts which are entitled to issue a declaration of incompatibility are the Supreme Court, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the Courts Martial Appeal Court, the High Court and Court of Appeal (England and Wales and Northern Ireland), and the High Court of Justiciary (Scotland) and Court of Protection in particular roles.  Application and section 10  In A v Home Secretary, the detention of foreign nationals under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 was ruled to be in contravention of Article 14 of the convention. They could be detained in circumstances British nationals could not, discriminating on the grounds of nationality. This discrimination was explicit and could not be interpreted to follow the Convention using Section 3. Accordingly, a declaration of incompatibility was made. In Bellinger v Bellinger, the court followed a European case, Goodwin v United Kingdom, in deciding that the failure to allow persons who had undergone gender reassignment to marry under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 was incompatible with Article 8 of the convention. Altering this would involve a \\"fundamental change in the traditional concept of marriage\\", which was the domain of the legislature and not the courts; accordingly, a declaration of incompatibility was issued. In R (Anderson) v Home Secretary, the court found that assigning the decision over the tariff of a mandatory life sentence to the Home Secretary was in breach of Article 6 of the Convention - however, he was explicitly given it under the statute, and it could not be removed merely by interpretation. Under Section 4(6)(b), a declaration of incompatibility is not even \\"binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made\\". Since a declaration cannot invalidate or disapply legislation, it achieves its aim through political rather than legal means - it is for Parliament to correct the law, or continue to be in contravention of the convention. Section 10 provides one route for correction: \\"If a Minister of the Crown considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section, he may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility\\" (section 10(2)). It is designed to be a quick method; although it must be put before parliament, a remedial order does not require full legislative approval. This summary process was controversial, as it ignored the possibility for debate. However, the time required for this could not be provided in reality. In any case, approval is still required before the order comes into force, or, in the case of urgent legislation, within 120 days of it coming into force. A remedial order can only be made after a declaration of incompatibility or a similar finding of a European court, which will have been justified and discussed before being made. Under Section 10(1), all appeals must have been complete or expressly renounced. Parliament has used Section 10 to make small adjustments where possible to bring legislation into line with Convention rights. In the Anderson and Bellinger cases, entirely new pieces of legislation were drafted and passed in the normal process, since they changed the law more considerably than the Section 10 process would allow.

Global public support for energy sources, based on a survey by Ipsos (2011).. Survey website: Ipsos MORI: Poll: Strong global opposition towards nuclear power . Public opinion on nuclear issues is the aggregate of attitudes or beliefs held by the adult population concerning nuclear power, nuclear weapons and uranium mining. According to environmentalist Stewart Brand and James Lovelock, the debate on nuclear power is far from being evidence-based and rational, with a number of anti-nuclear organizations trying to pull it into an \\"absolute evil\\" category and focusing on risks while ignoring the benefits such as zero emissions. Surveys about nuclear power use have been conducted internationally for four decades. Surveys originally examined public opinion on building new nuclear power plants. In the U.S., support has declined over the period from the mid-1970s through 2000. The Japanese were more supportive of nuclear power expansion during this time. 2005 In 2005, the International Atomic Energy Agency presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues report. The majority of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of terrorist acts involving radioactive materials at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down. Stressing the climate change benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.International Atomic Energy Agency (2005). Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues and the IAEA: Final Report from 18 Countries p. 6. A poll in the European Union for Feb-Mar 2005 showed 37% in favor of nuclear energy and 55% opposed, leaving 8% undecided. The same agency ran another poll in Oct-Nov 2006 that showed 14% favoured building new nuclear plants, 34% favored maintaining the same number, and 39% favored reducing the number of operating plants, leaving 13% undecided. This poll showed that the approval of nuclear power rose with the education level of respondents and was lower for women.Europeans and Nuclear Safety , February 2007. 2007 In the United States, the Nuclear Energy Institute has run polls since the 1980s. A poll in conducted March 30 to April 1, 2007 chose solar as the most likely largest source for electricity in the US in 15 years (27% of those polled) followed by nuclear, 24% and coal, 14%. Those who were favorable of nuclear being used dropped to 63% from a historic high of 70% in 2005 and 68% in September, 2006.Survey Reveals Gap in Public‚Äôs Awareness A CBS News/New York Times poll in 2007 showed that a majority of Americans would not like to have a nuclear plant built in their community, although an increasing percentage would like to see more nuclear power. The two fuel sources that attracted the highest levels of support in the 2007 MIT Energy Survey are solar power and wind power. Outright majorities would choose to ‚Äúincrease a lot‚Äù use of these two fuels, and better than three out of four Americans would like to increase these fuels in the U. S. energy portfolio. Fourteen per cent of respondents would like to see nuclear power \\"increase a lot\\".Stephen Ansolabehere.

Majority (over 62%) also appreciated nuclear power as means to prevent climate change. 2010 According to a 2010 Soka Gakkai International survey of youth attitudes in Japan, Korea, the Philippines, New Zealand and the USA, 67.3% reject the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Of the respondents 59.1% said that they would feel safer if nuclear weapons no longer existed in the world. Identified as most needed measures toward nuclear abolition were political and diplomatic negotiations (59.9%), peace education (56.3%) and strengthened measures within the UN framework (53.7%). While 37.4% said that nuclear abolition is possible, 40.7% said that nuclear arms reduction not abolition is possible.\\"A Survey on Public Awareness of Nuclear Weapons in Six Countries\\", published April 28, 2010. See also \\"Young people want nuclear disarmament: survey\\", Toronto Sun (April 29, 2010) Prominent environmentalist Stewart Brand published a Whole Earth Discipline book which was one of the first significant reversals of traditional anti-nuclear policy in the environmental movement. Director of Greenpeace UK (2001-2007) Stephen Tindale also expressed his support for nuclear power as effective means to prevent climate change. A number of polls on environmental websites (Grist.org, Treehugger.com) showed 59% and 54% respectively in \\"conditional support\\" for nuclear power. Both Eurobarometer 2008 and OECD poll (2010) indicated a \\"clear correlation between knowledge and support\\", where respondents who were more aware of the greenhouse gas emissions from energy sector were more likely to support low-emission nuclear power. 2011 A 2011 poll suggests that skepticism over nuclear power is growing in Sweden following Japan's nuclear crisis. 36 percent of respondents want to phase-out nuclear power, up from 15 percent in a similar survey two years ago. 2012 According to a 2012 Pew Research Center poll, 44% of Americans favor and 49% oppose the promotion of increased use of nuclear power, while 69% favor increasing federal funding for research on wind power, solar power, and hydrogen energy technology. Gallup poll found that 57% of American still favored nuclear energy. A meta-analysis also confirmed positive correlation between support for nuclear power and understanding of nuclear power operations, with a significant effect of people living closer to nuclear power plant showing higher levels of support in general. 2013 In 2013, Soka Gakkai International released the results of its international survey in which 91.2% of respondents believe that nuclear arms are inhumane and 80.6% favor a comprehensive treaty banning all weapons of mass destruction. The 2,840 survey respondents were men and women of ages 15 to 45 from Australia, Brazil, Britain, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea and the USA‚Äîthe official and unofficial nuclear weapon states, states under the US nuclear umbrella and states in nuclear-weapons-free zones (NWFZs). 2015 A Pew Research Survey conducted in 2015 found that Americans have shifted their view on the use of the atomic bomb to defeat the Japanese. 56% believe that the use of nuclear weapons was justified, with 34% saying it was not. Immediately after the bombings that figure was at 84% in favor of the bombing, according to a Gallup poll. 2016 A 2016 Gallup poll of the American public revealed that public support for nuclear energy in the United States was at a record low of 44%, with the majority (54%) of respondents saying that they oppose nuclear energy. This was the first time that public opposition to nuclear power in the United States had achieved a majority in the 23 years of Gallup polling on the subject. 2017 According to The Guardian, \\"A September poll by ReachTel found 73% of Australians support the ban on nuclear weapons and believe nuclear weapons pose a threat to global security.\\"  2019  In polls performed as part of preparation for a new nuclear power plant in Poland in the locations designated as possible plant locations 71% of the local residents supported the plan. In the USA support and opposition to nuclear power plants per Gallup survey is split almost equally, 49% opposing and 49% supporting them, while 47% believed they are safe.  2020  A Carnegie Mellon University study indicated strong \\"perception barrier and the regulatory cost\\" which makes it likely that existing nuclear power plants, under the current regulatory framework in the US, are more likely to be replaced by fossil fuel power plants which are perceived as \\"safer\\". This is even though an average nuclear power plant prevents emission of 2'000'000 metric tons of CO2, 5'200 metric tons of SO2 and 2'200 metric tons of NOx in a year.

ARS Germplasm Resources Information Network‚àíGRIN, Global Web v 1.9.6.2: Taxonomy of Holodiscus dumosus, with distribution data. Distribution The plant is native to western North America, where it occurs in northern Mexico and the Western United States.Fryer, Janet L. 2010. U.S. Forest Service, Fire Effects Information System: Holodiscus dumosus, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory [Online]. It grows in many types of forest and shrubland habitats, and plant communities. For example, it is characteristic of and sometimes dominant in the understory of Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, and Arizona pine forests and oak woodlands. It grows from in elevation, depending on latitude and climate. In Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Idaho it occurs in the Rocky Mountains. It has been called \\"nearly ubiquitous\\" in many plant communities in Utah. In Arizona it occurs in the mountain wilderness of the Madrean Sky Islands such as the Chiricahua Mountains, sometimes in scree with Douglas-fir, and is a common plant in the Grand Canyon. In Nevada it is a component of quaking aspen and willow communities and sagebrush of the Great Basin region. In Mexico it is native to the states of Chihuahua and Baja California. It is also native to northern California and Texas. The shrub tolerates a variety of soil types, as well as bare rock and rock fragments, such as crevices in cliffs and scree. It is drought-tolerant and survives in dry habitat, but it thrives in more moist locations, and can be found in wetter environments than its relative, Holodiscus discolor (creambush oceanspray). It can be found in cool, moist mountain forests in the central part of its range. It prefers sheltered locations that have less direct sunlight and wind. It anchors easily on steep slopes, and can grow on vertical topography, such as cliffs. Description Holodiscus dumosus is a deciduous spreading shrub, which grows from in height and in width.

It was founded by Brendon Chung in 2010 and is primarily a one-person effort. Blendo Games gained more widespread exposure with the short form stand alone title Gravity Bone; the following games Flotilla and Atom Zombie Smasher were met with critical praise. The studio has also released several other games in several genres. Background Brendon Chung at the 2017 Game Developers Choice Awards Chung had done hobbyist programming, such as modding for games like Quake 2 and Half-Life, for about a decade before being hired as a designer at Pandemic Studios. While there, he worked on The Lord of the Rings: Conquest and Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers, although he continued to work on personal projects including an episodic Citizen Abel series that toyed with traditional mechanics of first- person shooters. Chung considered his first officially released game to be the espionage game Gravity Bone in 2008. In November 2009, Electronic Arts shut down Pandemic Studios and Chung began development on Flotilla, a space combat game that takes cues from an abandoned personal project Chung had worked on previously. Flotilla was released in 2010. Later that same year, Blendo Games released Air Forte, an edutainment game in which the player indicates their knowledge about math, geography, and vocabulary by flying a plane in response to prompts. In 2011, Chung released real-time strategy game Atom Zombie Smasher, which received critical praise from several outlets and was featured at the 2011 Penny Arcade Expo, as well as being part of the 3rd Humble Indie Bundle charity drive. A sequel to Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, was developed to support a Kickstarter project for the Idle Thumbs podcast, and released in 2012.Blendo Games. Retrieved March 7, 2012.Meer, Alec (February 28, 2012). \\"Gravity Bone‚Äôs Sequel: Thirty Flights Of Loving\\". Rock Paper Shotgun. Retrieved March 7, 2012. Following Thirty Flights of Loving, Chung began what would become over four years of development on Quadrilateral Cowboy, which released in 2016. Flotilla 2, a virtual reality sequel to Flotilla, was released in August 2018. In October 2018, a new project titled Skin Deep was revealed to be in development at Blendo Games although no release date has yet been announced.  Culture  Blendo Games remains a one- man studio, though according to a 2016 feature in Gamasutra, Chung spends some time working in a shared office space called Glitch City. He has also directly collaborated with several individuals on several projects. The musical score of Thirty Flights of Loving was composed by Chris Remo, and the design of Quadrilateral Cowboy was a joint effort between Chung and Tynan Wales. The Mac and Linux ports of Quadrilateral Cowboy were done by Aaron Melcher, and the game's art book was ported to those same platforms by Ethan Lee. Chung has also indicated he gets play testing help from his friends and family. Barista Barista is a series of four first-person games for Microsoft Windows by Brendon Chung. All of the games involve the player character waking up. The first game is a modification for Doom II: Hell on Earth. In an interview, Chung stated that his inspirations for the first game included the Doom Bible and Bungie's Marathon. Chung has indicated the second game was an independent study project developed while he was in college. It centers on a nameless spaceship pilot, and features a disjointed story line. There are several characters featured, including a talking skull and an unidentified woman. The skull mentions a person named Hannah, though when an interviewer suggested the unidentified woman was Hannah, Chung said \\"she's not Hanna. You never meet Hanna.\\" The third game is a modification for Doom 3. The fourth game is a modification for Half-Life 2. Chung has indicated he developed the game so he could learn the constraints of the Id Tech 4 engine before using it on a larger project.

He was Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried and Hesse-Rheinfels from 1731 until his death.  Early life  As a younger son from his father's second marriage in a Catholic cadet line of the House of Hesse, Christian was originally meant to become a canon in Strasbourg. However, in 1710, at the age of 21, he opted for a career in the military. He served in the army of Hesse-Kassel, most recently as Brigadier.  Inheritance dispute  After his father's death in 1711 he took up government in Hesse-Wanfried. His older half-brother, William II, however, appeared in Wanfried in the same year to put forward his own claim to this part of the inheritance. The dispute had to be settled by the Emperor. Christian had to give up the landgraviate. Instead, he received an annual pension of 7500 guilders. He also received Eschwege Castle in Eschwege in 1713, after Hesse-Kassel had repaid its debt to the Duke of Brunswick-Bevern. Christian renovated and expanded the neglected castle and added a Catholic chapel. He began calling himself Christian of Hesse-Eschwege. He continued using this name even after he inherited Hesse-Wanfried and Hesse-Rheinfels in 1731 from his childless half-brother William II.  Reign  After the death of his childless half-brother William in 1731, Christian succeeded him as Landgrave in 1732 and moved into the residence at Wanfried. He concluded a treaty with his cousin, Landgrave Ernest Leopold of Hesse-Rotenburg to have both parts of the Rotenburg Quarter administered jointly by the chancellery in Rotenburg. He gradually moved his residence back to Eschwege, where he constructed his Princely Stables in 1735. Also in 1735, he sold Rheinfels Castle back to Hesse-Kassel. He was described as \\"agreeable and well-educated and was very popular in Eschwege, where he usually resided, and in Wanfried. Although he spent most of his later years in Eschwege, he still frequently visited Wanfried to support the local artisans. In both Eschwege and Wanfried, he commissioned numerous works of art for himself and his court.  Death  Christian died of a stroke on 21 October 1755 on the steps of the church in Eschwege. He was buried in the family crypt in the H√ºlfensberg. His widow moved to Frankfurt, where she died on 11 December 1757. With his death, the Hesse-Wanfried line died out after 88 years. His territory fell to Hesse- Rotenburg.  Marriage  He was engaged to Maria Augusta, the daughter of Prince Anselm Francis of Thurn und Taxis. However, Emperor Charles VI requested a cancellation of the betrothal for political reasons, so that she could marry Duke Charles Alexander of W√ºrttemberg, the governor of Serbia, which she did in May 1727. Christian mourned his great love for a long time. He finally married at the age of 42 with his niece, Maria Franziska of Hohenlohe-Bartenstein, the daughter of his sister Sophie Leopoldine. The marriage remained childless.  References  * Reinhold Strau√ü: Chronik der Stadt Wanfried, Braun, Wanfried, 1908. * Chronik von Wanfried 2006 (unpublished) * Eckhart G. Franz: Das Haus Hessen.

The institution was founded on September 4, 1942 and is mostly known for its football team, which played in the Primera D Metropolitana. Although Pira√±a has not participated in any AFA tournament since, the club still has its headquarters in Parque de los Patricios, where social and sports activities are hosted. Sports currently hosted by Pira√±a are youth football, female football and taekwondo. History The beginning Club's founder and first president, Alcides Sol√©, was friend of Jaime Sarlanga who had gained reputation as a great forward, having scored 42 goals in Boca Juniors (where he was playing after his runs on Tigre and Ferro Carril Oeste)). In fact, Sarlanga is currently ranked 5th amongst Boca Juniors' all-time top scorers, with 122 goals. Sarlanga was also known by the nickname \\"Pira√±a\\" (\\"Piranhe\\" in English, due to his \\"appetite\\" for goals) and this denomination was taken by Sol√© to found Club Atl√©tico Pira√±a on September 12, 1942, as a tribute to his friend Sarlanga.\\"Pira√±a, la cuna del gol\\", Clar√≠n, 2009-04-18 Pira√±a affiliated to Argentine Football Association in 1961 and played its first official match against Arsenal de Sarand√≠, with finished in a 1-1 draw. The golden years Club headquarters in Buenos Aires H√©ctor Yazalde had been rejected from Los Andes and Racing Club, due to his scrawny body which did not convince football clubs to hire him. In 1965, when he was only 18, Yazalde went to a practise of Pira√±a and he was offered to play for a while. His outstanding performance convinced club's managers to hire him immediately. The other notable player for Pira√±a was Delf√≠n Ben√≠tez, who was nephew of great 1930s scorer Delf√≠n Ben√≠tez C√°ceres. Both Yazalde and Ben√≠tez were the most influential players of Pira√±a during that season. The team that won the Primera D title in 1978 In the first stage, Pira√±a lost only one match (at the hands of Trist√°n Su√°rez) having scored 64 goals within 20 games. \\"Both Yazalde and I made about 70 goals, I scored 45 and he did 25\\", said Ben√≠tez, who did not play the last few matches because of his job. At the end of the season, Pira√±a, General Mitre and Centro Espa√±ol shared the first place so a mini- tournament had to be played in order to proclaim a champion. Mitre defeated Pira√±a 3-2 in Atlanta's stadium. After that match, Independiente hired Yazalde for $ 1,800,000. Yazalde debuted for the Rojo in 1967 scoring 72 goals in 113 matches, before being traded to Sporting Lisboa where he had a successful career.

The team (which also conceded 115 goals) was relegated to Primera D. Pira√±a did another bad campaign in the lowest division, where only won 3 games and lost 17, with only 14 goals scored. That same year Pira√±a disaffiliated from the Football Association. In successive years, club's facilities were almost abandoned and it was about to be closed in 2015.

Life He was the son of John Shaw of London. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 10 June 1687, and in 1695 entered the Middle Temple. About 1700 he made a tour through Holland, Flanders, and part of France, and embodied his observations in a series of letters to Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury, whose friendship and patronage he enjoyed. The letters were published in 1709. They contain details on those countries during the interval of peace which followed the Treaty of Ryswick. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1703 In later life Shaw settled at Epsom in Surrey, and devoted himself to legal study. In 1728 he published The Practical Justice of the Peace, which attained its sixth edition in 1756. Shortly before his death he published a companion volume entitled Parish Law, dedicated to his personal friend, Sir John Fortescue Aland, justice of common pleas, which remained a standard work on the subject. In the 19th century it was published with J. F. Archbold's Parish Officer. The last edition was published in 1895. In Nobell v Durell (1789) 3 T.R 271 Lord Kenyon, chief justice of the Court of Kings Bench, in response to a reference to Shaw by counsel, observed 'that Shaw was but an ordinary writer', at p. 271 note(c).

The core of its funding comes from the HSE, the Republic of Ireland's public health sector. Background Enable Ireland was founded in 1948 originally as Cerebral Palsy Ireland. Its founder, Dr Robert Collis, used a ¬£100 donation from the Marrowbone Fund to establish an assessment clinic for children with disabilities. Initially, assessment and treatment services were provided on a voluntary basis. The National Association of Cerebral Palsy was then established in 1951 and worked in conjunction with the Irish government, mostly through County Councils, Regional Health Boards and the Department of Education, in order to provide a range of services for children with physical disabilities and their families. In the 1980s a branch network was created by families throughout Ireland to meet the need for assessment and treatment. These volunteers carried out roles as advocates and fundraisers which contributed to the growth of Enable Ireland and its notability. By the 1980s, Enable Ireland had also established an innovative fundraising strategy. A retail chain was founded to supplement the running costs and build a capital fund to boost State provisions. The profits generated have enhanced Enable Ireland's capacity to work in partnership with the State in the expansion of services and facilities.

Kennedy Human Rights Award and Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize 2011 for his activism. Mugisha is one of the most prominent advocates for LGBT rights in Uganda. Biography Mugisha was born in a suburb of Kampala, Uganda. Raised in a strict Catholic family, he came out to his brother at age 14. Although his coming out estranged him from some family members, other friends and family have continued to support him. While still at university in 2004, he founded Icebreakers Uganda, an organization created as a support network for LGBT Ugandans who are out or in the process of coming out to family and friends. Mugisha is now the executive director of SMUG, an umbrella organization that consists of eighteen groups, including Icebreakers Uganda. Mugisha has been honored by the UN - Secretary General. Listed in the Advocate Magazine, The Independent, honored by Black Entertainment Television - BET and Mugisha was named by #POWER10: among most Influential Black LGBTQ people in 2014. Mugisha was close friends with fellow advocate and SMUG founder David Kato, who was murdered in January 2011 after successfully suing a tabloid named Rolling Stone for publishing the names of 100 LGBT Ugandans with an encouragement to \\"hang them\\". Mugisha is one of the plaintiffs from SMUG represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights using the Alien Tort Statute to sue American evangelist Scott Lively for crimes against humanity for his work on the Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Bill, work described as inciting the persecution of gay men and lesbians and as \\"conduct ... actively trying to harm and deprive other people of their rights [which] is the definition of persecution\\". In August 2013, Federal U.S. District Court Judge Michael A. Ponsor ruled that the plaintiffs were on solid ground under international and federal law in rejecting a jurisdictional challenge to the suit; he also ruled that First Amendment defenses for Lively's conduct were premature. Writing in The Guardian in 2014, Mugisha argued that homophobia and the hatred behind the Anti-Homosexuality Bill were from western influences: \\"I am a gay man. I am also Ugandan. There is nothing un-African about me. Uganda is where I was born, grew up and call my home. It is also a country in which I have become little more than an unapprehended criminal because of whom I love. I want my fellow Ugandans to understand that homosexuality is not a western import and our friends in the developed world to recognise that the current trend of homophobia is.\\" Recognition Mugisha was awarded the 2011 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award and the 2011 Rafto Prize, whose previous laureates include Aung San Suu Kyi, Jose Ramos-Horta, Kim Dae-jung and Shirin Ebadi, for his work pursuing LGBT rights in Uganda. He also received an honorary doctorate of the University of Ghent. Mugisha is 2014 nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2017, Mugisha was included in Fortune Magazine's list of world's greatest leaders.

Retrieved 2011-06-29. The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project . This definition, argued by Muzellec and McDonagh refers to the brand as a single reality or focus on only one-way addressable interaction partners that in many way are not current with customer communications.Muzellec, Laurent and Pierre McDonagh \\"Post-Modern Brand Management: The Virtual Case of Red Apple Cigarettes‚Äù in Halld√≥r √ñrn Engilbertsson (Ed.), Proceedings of the 36th European Marketing Academy Conference, Reykjavik University, Reykjavik. As a result, many companies are rapidly changing the way they manage the created names, terms, designs, symbols and other marketing material on behalf of the brand. The significance here is not only focusing on and tracking the organizational created material, but also identifying, monitoring and tracking the material created or suggested by the enthusiast, loyalist, defectors and the like. In order to properly engage within the postmodern world of marketing a brand will need to adapt of set of new systems that that give great insights. Newly developed systems are in need for a brand to be more nimble and personal with their customers. Although this is an ever-evolving time it bears witness that there are new rules to the ‚Äúnew now‚Äù or ‚Äúnew new now‚Äù of marketing. And although an organization employs any platforms and processes the brand manager should realize that the brand they are managing is still just a participant in the community they wish to create. With that said, the organization should come to grips with the idea that they may not own the very brand they created.Massi, Marta and Paul Harrison \\"Re-Imagining the Cultural Brand: Postmodernism and Next Wave\\", Academy of Marketing Conference (2008) Influential postmodern brands Coke Coke is one of the more influential brands within the carbonated beverage industries. Although they have experienced an ongoing soda war with Pepsi dating back to the 1960s, they have emerged recently with an approach, Wendy White implies as agnostic and focused on telling engaging stories no matter where the consumer is. Additionally, this approach allows the user to take part in the brand, identify with the story being told and engage in the way he or she feels fit. As a result of the approach the brand has seen great success in capturing the number two beverage position in terms of units sold while defending their legacy position as number one. Starbucks Although Starbucks has had minor setbacks in navigating the ‚Äúnew now‚Äù, postmodern marketing landscape (53% drop in profits in 2009), they are still seen to be a leader in the space. At the current writing of this document, the brand has over 25M likes on Facebook with 279 people talking about their brand online. Additionally the brand has also ushered in a sea of change by creating one of the most intuitive and innovative mobile apps in the market. In partnership with mFoundry, Starbucks created a mobile payment application that is in current use nationwide and within the first two months of the application being live over 3M customers downloaded and used it. If these two examples are not enough to illustrate the brands commitment to the postmodern model of consumer engagement the use and execution of the branded social network, ‚ÄúMyStarbucksIdea.com‚Äù does. MyStarbucksIdea is a perfect example of giving up control of the brand to consumers. The social network allows consumers and loyalists to suggest ideas based on their personal experience with the company. Based on these suggest and the recommendations for the community Starbucks is able to more efficiently plan strategic roadmaps around consumer interactions. To date the brand has received over 120k ideas ranging from ordering, atmosphere, coffee and drinks to new technology.

These two elements are often created in a two-step process where the future image is created first (envisioning) followed by an exploration of the alternative pathways available to reach the future goal (backcasting). Both these processes can use participatory techniques (Raskin et al., 2002Raskin, P., T. Banuri, G. Gallop√≠n, P. Gutman, A. Hammond, R. Kates, and R. Swart. (2002). The Great Transition: The Promise and the Lure of the Times Ahead. Boston, MA: Tellus Institute.) where participants of varying backgrounds and interests are provided with an open and supportive group environment to discuss different contributing elements and actions. Transition scenarios are unique in type not only in terms of how they are created (process) but also their content. Their requirements are guided by transition management concepts and consider the \\"fundamental and irreversible change in the culture, structure and practices of a system\\" (Sondeijker, 2009:52,Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Transition scenarios are emerging as a scenario type which is more applicable to the context of sustainable development based on their abilities to capture the complexities of system structure and innovation (Loorbach, 2007; Rotmans, 2005,Loorbach, D.A. (2007), Transition Management: new mode of governance for sustainable development, DRIFT, RotterdamRotmans, J. (2005) Societal Innovation: Between Dream and Reality Lies Complexity, Inaugural Speech, Rotterdam, Erasmus Research Institute of Management). Scenario types There are various types of scenarios that can be used for a range of purposes and are predominantly split between first, second and third generation scenarios. First generation First generation scenarios are intended to predict the future as accurately as possible, for instance by extrapolating trends. Examples of these scenarios are weather predictions, forecasts for a wide range of topics such as economic growth, population, building volume etc. They are predominantly based on the quantitative / econometric extrapolation of trends. Another part is based on qualitative \\"trend watching methods\\" (e.g. fashion). Second generation Second generation scenarios have a more explorative character. Scenarios can be intended to explore possibilities for the future, without pronouncing upon their probability or desirability. Scenarios can then be defined as \\"a tool for ordering alternative future environments in which one's decision may be played out\\" (Peter Schwartz, 1991,Schwartz, P. (1991). The art of the long view. Doubleday. New York, USA). These scenarios are based on the presumption that nobody can predict, and therefore should not try to predict the future. \\"The only relevant discussions about the future are those where we succeed from shifting from the question \\"whether something will happen\\" to the question \\"what will we do IF something happens\\" (Arie de Geus, 1998,De Geus, A. (1997). The living company. Longview Publishing Limited, USA.). An example of this type of scenario was developed by Shell (The Shell scenario method). Third generation Third generation scenarios focus on long time spans and preferred societal systems which are normative and explorative in nature and reflective of the structural and societal changes required in pursuing sustainability (Sondeijker, 2009; Edquist 2005,Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The NetherlandsEdquist, C. (2005). Systems of innovation: Perspectives and challenges. In J. Fagerberg, D. C. Mowery & R. R. Nelson (Eds.), The Oxford handbook of innovation (pp. 181-208). Oxford: Oxford University Press.). These scenarios are intended to produce a picture of the future we want. The question then is: \\"what do we actually want the future to look like?\\", examples of these scenarios are based, amongst others, on the European Awareness method and include the use of energy in urban environments, sustainable production and consumption, and normative \\"factor 4\\" studies. These scenarios were devised based on the claim that scenarios active in first and second generation scenario methods cannot live up to the challenge of imagining, contributing and preparing for the dynamic processes of transformative change. Transitions are complex interactions which need system approaches to define paths towards a sustainable future and transition scenarios are set to address these concerns by providing a method to handle these issues. Content and process The creation of transition scenarios has two basic objectives. To ensure that the scenario created is relevant to the concepts of transition management to allow the system to be systematically analysed and to contribute to social learning. These objectives are encapsulated in the content and process, respectively, of transition scenario creation. Content Transition scenarios are informed by transition management concepts and theories which it uses as a basis for its contents. In particular, transition scenarios consider long time frames and are both normative and explorative in nature. Their contents are predominantly centred on the following elements (Sondeijker 2009; Geels, F. W, 2002, Kemp et al. 1998,Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The NetherlandsGeels, F. W. (2002), Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: A multi-level perspective and a case-study, Research Policy 31(8/9), 1257-1274.Kemp, R., Schot, J., Hoogma, R. (1998), Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: the approach of strategic niche management, In: Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 10(2): 175-195.): Multi-level criteria Multi-level criteria relate to elements of change (weak signals) that can be identified in present structures occurring at different levels of the system. These provide the opportunity to recognise and investigate levers than can be used for long run transitions. Weak signals combined with uncertain developments can produce the appropriate climate for structural change. Anticipation of weak signals is essential if the development of scenarios beyond the scope of current developments is to be reached. Multi-pattern criteria Multi-pattern criteria describe the interaction between actors and structure of the system being analysed. This includes action derived from bottom-up initiatives which are built up from actor groups which are involved in niche-based innovation activities which infiltrate and eventually change the dominant regimes. Equally important are actors across and between levels which can support and further accelerate change. This ensures that practices and habits in the system are transformed through the replacement of the old dominant regime with the new desired future state. Multi-phase criteria Multi-phase criteria refer to the different timings of the alternating stages involved in transition management: predevelopment phase, take-off phase, acceleration phase and the stabilisation phase. The nature and speeds of these phases inform the character of the transition highlighting the importance of the barriers and drivers identified. In the take-off phase the point of no return is reached followed by the acceleration phase where cultural, structural and practice changes occur most visibly. Process Transition scenarios are also process orientated focusing on the ability of different stakeholders and participants to communicate and imagine their desired future within the discussion groups. Through this participatory process participants are encouraged to change mind set and attitude to think from a long-term perspective. Specific focus on various feasible topics will increase participants' knowledge of the topic area and the alternatives available in its context. These lessons may eventually be internalised within participants resulting in a social learning process (Social Learning Group, 2001,Social Learning Group (2001). Learning to manage global environmental risks. Edited by S.L.Group, Vol 1&2, Cambridge Massachusetts: The MIT Press.). Sustainable low-carbon futures Europe, along with the rest of the world, is facing the challenge of climate change and its impacts on the environment, economy and society. In order to address these concerns and to adopt a proactive approach in finding solutions, the European Commission launched its Europe 2020 Strategy in 2010 followed by its Roadmap for 2050. The 2020 strategy puts forward a vision of a Europe which has increased employment, invests in research and development, ensures more young people finish school and obtain university degrees, has fewer people threatened by poverty, has a reduced greenhouse gas level of 20% compared with 1990 level, has an increased contribution of renewable energy to reach 20% of total energy consumption and has increased efficiency by 20%. The 2050 Roadmap sets forward possibilities to reaching the more stringent 80% reduction target of greenhouse gases in 2050 by considering various scenarios and setting milestones for a 40% reduction by 2030 and 60% by 2040. It is clear from this strategy and roadmap that Europe needs to transition to a future which is quite different from the one which follows a \\"business as usual\\" trajectory. This need formed the basis from which the EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) under its call \\"Foresight to enhance behavioural and societal changes enabling the transition towards sustainable paths in Europe\\" was created. Three projects focusing on transition scenarios and management were selected to provide range in application and context. These projects are as follows: * CRISP (CReating Innovative Sustainability Pathways) aims to identify sustainable low carbon futures and pathways. This intent will allow the project to recommend new policy mixes and innovative cooperation mechanisms that will support and promote transitions. In order to achieve these objectives, it employs transition scenarios and participatory approaches to ensure people of all ages and backgrounds are actively involved in the discourse on sustainable development. * INCONTEXT (Individuals in Context: Supportive Environments for Sustainable Living) studies both the internal and external contexts in which change occurs. Through the use of multi-disciplinary approaches insights into the role played by social norms, policies and infrastructure (external context) and needs, values and priorities (internal context) can be gauged within the agency-structure debate. The project‚Äôs main output is to help inform policies that can support internal changes required for sustainable action. * LOCAW (Low Carbon at Work: Modelling agents and organisations to achieve transition to a low carbon Europe) aims to gain insight into the drivers and barriers of sustainability practices within the work place across different organizations within the EU. The multi-disciplinary approach is used to create the desirable low-carbon futures, map the alternative pathways and gain insight into how cooperative interaction needs to be supported to encourage sustainable development. This latter point is predominantly investigated through the use of agent based modelling.

COPA, is a leading case of the Supreme Court of Canada on determining the applicability of the doctrines of interjurisdictional immunity and federal paramountcy in Canadian constitutional law. The facts An aerodrome, registered under the federal Aeronautics Act, was constructed on land zoned as agricultural in the province of Quebec. Section 26 of the Quebec Act respecting the preservation of agricultural land and agricultural activities (‚ÄúARPALAA‚Äù) prohibited the use of lots in a designated agricultural region for any purpose other than agriculture, subject to prior authorization by the Commission de protection du territoire agricole du Qu√©bec. Since the Commission‚Äôs permission was not obtained prior to constructing the aerodrome, the Commission ordered the return of the land to its original state pursuant to the ARPALAA. The Commission‚Äôs decision was challenged on the ground that aeronautics is within federal jurisdiction. The courts below The Administrative Tribunal of Quebec, the Court of Quebec and the Superior Court of Quebec all upheld the Commission's decision, but the Quebec Court of Appeal found that interjurisdictional immunity precluded the Commission from ordering the dismantling of the aerodrome. Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada The appeal was dismissed. Interjurisdictional immunity was held to apply in the matter, under a two-part test that was stated by McLachlin CJ: While ARPALAA is valid provincial legislation, it is inapplicable to the extent that it impacts the federal power over aeronautics. The federal aeronautics jurisdiction encompasses not only the regulation of the operation of aircraft and airports, but also the power to determine the location of airports and aerodromes. This power is an essential and indivisible part of aeronautics and, as such, lies within the protected core of the federal aeronautics power.COPA, par. 34 In prohibiting the building of aerodromes on designated agricultural land unless prior authorization has been obtained from the Commission, the ARPALAA effectively removed the total area of the designated agricultural regions from the territory that Parliament may designate for aeronautical uses. This is not an insignificant amount of land, and much of it is strategically located.COPA, par. 48 * Although s. 26 does not sterilize Parliament‚Äôs power to legislate on aeronautics the doctrine of paramountcy would permit Parliament to legislatively override provincial zoning legislation for the purpose of establishing aerodromes , it nevertheless seriously affected the manner in which the power can be exercised. * If s. 26 applied, it would force the federal Parliament to choose between accepting that the province can forbid the placement of aerodromes on the one hand, or specifically legislating to override the provincial law on the other hand. This would seriously impair the federal power over aviation, effectively forcing the federal Parliament to adopt a different and more burdensome scheme for establishing aerodromes than it has in fact chosen to do. In the appeal, it had been argued by Quebec that interjurisdictional immunity did not apply where a law raises a double aspect. Although it was not necessary to decide that question, it was stated that the argument misapprehended the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity: The doctrine of federal paramountcy would not apply in this case.COPA, par. 6364 * Paramountcy may flow either from the impossibility of complying with both federal and provincial laws or from the frustration of a federal purpose. Here, there was no operational conflict, since the federal legislation did not require the construction of an aerodrome and it is possible to comply with both the provincial and federal legislation by demolishing the aerodrome. * There was also no evidence establishing that a federal purpose regarding the location of aerodromes was frustrated by the provincial legislation. The federal regulations provide that the Minister responsible may determine that the location of each registered aerodrome is in the public interest, but they do not disclose any federal purpose with respect to the location of aerodromes. Dissent Deschamps J declared that the only difference between the present case and Quebec (Attorney General) v. Lacombe (which was released on the same day) was that Lacombe was concerned with municipal zoning and COPA with a provincial agricultural zoning scheme. She concluded that there was no evidence of an incidental effect that would amount to an impairment of the core of the federal aeronautics power.COPA, par. 7992 Impact This case, together with the concurrent case of Lacombe, has further added to the Court's jurisprudence on Canadian federalism in a significant manner. There has been discussion as to the consistency of these rulings in comparison to previous jurisprudence, but the Court's tests for paramountcy and interjurisdictional immunity in COPA have been cited in subsequent constitutional jurisprudence, especially in: :* :* :*  See also  * Quebec (Attorney General) v.

Peter Lorre plays a harmless, half-addled aircraft enthusiast who is actually a ruthless spy desperate to get his hands on the blueprints for an experimental aircraft. He faces off against Ace Martin, played by Brian Donlevy, the pilot of the aircraft, whose motives are spurred by feeling cheated by his own company. The supporting cast includes Helen Wood, Ralph Morgan and Thomas Beck. Plot Although shot on a sound stage, the dangerous repair of the \\"Wild Goose\\" used a full-size mock-up of an airliner. At the christening of the \\"Wild Goose,\\" an experimental aircraft designed for transatlantic flights, a number of significant industry figures from the Fleming-Grant Airways Corporation are present. President John R. Fleming (Ralph Morgan) introduces the test pilots, Ace Martin (Brian Donlevy) and Joe Randall (Thomas Beck), along with Joe's fianc√©e, Ruth Franklin (Helen Wood). The eccentric Colonel Gimpy (Peter Lorre) convinces company people that he loves aviation and joins the group. He is really Baron Rudolph Maximilian Tagger, the head of a foreign spy ring, who plans to steal plans for the company's new secret \\"D.O.X.\\" bomber design. Gimpy seeks out a disgruntled Ace Martin and offers him money to betray his employer. Ace uses Joe, his young prot√©g√©, to obtain the plans, telling him he had made the blueprints. The Baron's Operative #77 (J. Carrol Naish), secretly working for another spy organization, attempts to get the plans, offering Ace three times more money. The meeting between the two is watched by the baron, forcing Ace to kill the spy and keep the plans to bargain directly with the baron. On the maiden flight of the \\"Wild Goose\\", Ace and Joe are flying to Berlin with the company president on board. When they are in the air, Colonel Gimpy reveals that he has stowed away to accompany them. A gas cap comes loose, jeopardizing the flight. Ace volunteers to climb out onto the wing and secure the gas cap. At the War Department, officials tell Ruth that Joe has been unwittingly drawn into a spy operation. She radios the aircraft, now far off course over the Atlantic Ocean, convincing Joe to turn Ace in. Reacting angrily, he tries to shake Ace off the wing, but is restrained by the others. When Ace returns, a struggle over the controls leads to a burst of steam spraying over Ace's face, blinding him and the aircraft being forced to ditch in the ocean. With death imminent, as water fills the cabin, Ace shoots the baron and gives Joe the only life jacket, along with the bomber blueprints, so that he will be rescued by a nearby steamer. The three doomed men left on board smoke a last cigarette as the \\"Wild Goose\\" sinks.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82318 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Herron in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Scheina, p 72 Design and construction details Point Herron was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was the first in class to be powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Herron included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History After delivery in 1961, Point Herron was assigned a homeport of Lewes, Delaware, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat until 1964. In 1965 she was reassigned to Cape May, New Jersey. The following year she was transferred to Bay Shore, New York where she served from 1966 through 1981. From 1982 until decommissioning she was homeported at Babylon, New York.Scheina, p 74 On 27 July 1991 Point Herron was decommissioned and transferred to Mexico.

Biography Early life Runyon was born on a farm near Catlettsburg, Kentucky, to Floyd and Elizabeth Runyon. Runyon received a limited formal education and was largely self-taught. He married Nora Young in 1901 and worked as an insurance salesman in Ashland, Kentucky. Nora's death in 1908 led him to travel to New Orleans and Houston in search of employment. The Gulf Coast News and Hotel Company hired him to sell fruit, candy, sandwiches, and cigarettes to St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway passengers in early 1909. Several months later he was promoted to manager of Gulf Coast's lunchroom and curio shop in the Brownsville train station. Photography Runyon opened a commercial photography studio in 1910. He initially photographed urban life Brownsville and Matamoros, Tamaulipas and the surrounding terrain of the Rio Grande Valley. In 1913, Runyon began recording the events of the Mexican Revolution, starting with the takeover of the Matamoros garrison by the Constitutional Army under General Lucio Blanco on June 3. He traveled with Blanco's forces to Ciudad Victoria and later Monterrey. In 1915, Runyon was the only professional to photograph two skirmishes by Mexican bandits on American soil, the Norias Ranch Raid and a train derailment near Olmito, Texas. He took more than 2,000 pictures of Fort Brown, which captured troop buildup and mechanization in preparation for World War I. Runyon returned to more traditional subjects in the border region, as well as portraits and postcards, following the end of the war. Merchant He closed the studio in 1926 to become a partner in a Matamoros curio shop alongside his brother-in-law, Jos√© Medrano, whom he bought out three years later. He ran this store until 1938 and also operated a similar one in Brownsville. Botany Beginning in the late 1920s, Runyon became a successful amateur botanist, discovering several new species and accumulating a massive private herbarium. He wrote Texas Cacti: A Popular and Scientific Account of the Cacti Native of Texas with Ellen Schulz Quillin (1930) and Vernacular Names of Plants Indigenous to the Lower Rio Grande Valley in (1947). A third book, An Annotated List of the Flora of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, went unpublished due to his death. Runyon was a charter member of the Cactus and Succulent Society of America and served as its regional vice president in 1942 and fellow in 1945. He was also involved in the Texas Academy of Science, the Botanical Society of America, the Torrey Botanical Club, the American Society of Plant Taxonomists, the International Association for Plant Taxonomy, and the Phi Sigma chapter at the University of Texas at Austin. Politics Runyon became active as a politician starting in the late 1930s and was appointed Brownsville city manager in 1937. On November 4, 1941, he was elected to a two-year term as mayor of the city. Runyon was appointed as the aide-de-camp of Kentucky Governor Earle C. Clements's staff in 1949 and received a commission as a colonel. He chaired the Cameron County Democratic Executive Committee from 1950 to 1952. Runyon unsuccessfully ran for the Texas House of Representatives in 1952. He served as a member and later chairman of the Brownsville Planning and Zoning Board between 1959 and 1961. Later life Runyon died at the age of 86 on March 9, 1968 and was buried in Buena Vista Cemetery. Personal life Runyon married Nora Young on September 16, 1901 and had a single son with her, William. His second wife, Amelia Lenor Medrano, was the daughter of a respected Matamoros family. They married on July 4, 1913 and had five children together between 1914 and 1926: Lillian, Amali, Virginia, Robert, and Delbert. Legacy and namesakes Following his death, Runyon's herbarium was donated to the University of Texas at Austin, while Texas A&I; University received his botanical library.

Kerry, Ireland. Adapted from: W.F. Butler; \\"Pedigree and Succession of the House of MacCarthy M√≥r, With a Map'\\"; Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland\\"; Vol. 51, May 1920. The Lordship of Coshmaing is an historic honorific title associated with the Gaelic nobility of Ireland. The title was created in the 14th century when the then King of Desmond, granted an appanage (estate and title) to one of his sons. As with other such titles in Ireland, it no-longer has any recognition under the law, and has not been used for several hundred years. Background As a republic, the Constitution of Ireland prohibits the conferring of \\"titles of nobility\\" by the state. While some titles had obtained \\"courtesy recognition\\" by the Chief Herald of Ireland, this practice was discontinued by 2003 when the Attorney General noted that such recognitions were unconstitutional and without basis in law. As \\"incorporeal hereditaments\\", any lands which may have historically related to such a title and long since disassociated from these (now) honorific titles - and such titles no longer attach to any territories. History The Lordship of Coshmaing (also spelled variously as \\"Cosmaigne,\\" \\"Coshmang,\\" \\"Cois Mainge,\\" etc.) was created in the 14th century when the King of Desmond, Cormac MacCarthy M√≥r (d. 1359), granted an appanageAppanage ‚Äì the grant of an estate, titles, offices, or other things of value to the younger (non- successor) male children of a sovereign to his third son, Eoghan. (His second son, Diarmud, was granted the appanage of the Lordship of Muskerry.) Thus established the family/sept of Sliocht Eoghan (Owen) M√≥r of Coshmaing, which was located in today's County Kerry, Ireland, Barony of Magunihy, Province of Munster. Butler described the inception of Coshmaing thusly: \\"Eoghan was given the lordship of Coshmaing. This district stretched from the modern boundary of Cork across the northern and western parts of the barony of Magunihy to close to Castlemaine\\"; and, \\"The area of Coshmaing according to the Lambeth Survey was twenty-three quarters and a half and a third of a quarter.... Sir William Herbert estimates the area of Coshmaing at 88 ploughlands, and an inquisition of 1634 gives it as 105 ploughlands\\". \\"Coshmaing was a frontier district, forming a barrier between the lands of the Geraldines and the rest of the Kerry lands of the MacCarthys. In the same way Muskerry formed a frontier barrier to the east, and Duhallow to the north-east against the foreigner\\". Sub-lordships As a \\"frontier\\" district, Coshmaing served as a buffer between the MacCarthy territories of Desmond (MacCarthys M√≥r, MacCarthy Reaghs of Carbery, and MacCarthys of Muskerry). It was the northernmost line of MacCarthy defence in the almost-constant conflict with the Norman-Irish family of the Earls of Desmond, the FitzGeralds (Geraldines). The MacCarthys and FitzGeralds, at least once, combined their defences against \\"new\\" invaders: the town of Castlemaine (although not technically within the territory of Coshmaing) \\"takes its name from a castle erected on a bridge over the river Maine by McCarthy More and the Earl of Desmond, as a defence to their frontiers\\". The Lordship of Coshmaing is a Paramount lordship, of comital (Count) rank (Gaelic: Ard Tiarna na Cois Mainge). The original Lord of Coshmaing, Eoghan M√≥r MacCarthy, head of Sliocht Eoghan of Coshmaing, granted sub-lordships to his two sons: Cormac (West Coshmaing), and Donal (East Coshmaing, known as the Lordship of Molahiffe [tiarnas/baronial-rank]). In turn, Cormac's two sons also received grants of sub-lordships (tiarnas) ‚Äì Donal (Lord of Clonmeallane), and Eoghan/Owen (Lord of Fieries ‚Äì in Gaelic, foithre, meaning \\"woods\\"). The lordships of Molahiffe, Fieries and Clonmeallane each had castles that survived for various tenures up until the Cromwellian Confisacations (ca. 1649‚Äì53). Devolution of the title In The MacCarthys of Munster, Samuel Trant MacCarthy (M√≥r) describes the end of the original main line of Coshmaing as follows: \\"The Calendar of Patent Rolls of Elizabeth A.D. 1588, mentions Teige MacDermod MacCormac as apparently the last Lord of Coshmang.... slain in a skirmish near Aghadoe (ca. 1581).\\" Among the cadet lines of the original Sliocht Eoghan of Coshmaing, only the male line of what is believed to be the Molahiffe branch descended into the 19th century. The last known possible claimant to the Coshmaing title was Brig. Gen. Sir Charles MacCarthy, who died (without issue) in an 1824 battle with the Ashantis, in Sierra Leone, Africa. Under Gaelic-Irish Brehon law, a title granted by a royal/noble house re-vests in the house of the overlordship when the male line of the title-holder becomes extinct. Thus, the title of the Lord (Ard Tiarna) of Coshmaing re-vested with the Royal House of MacCarthy M√≥r as of 1581, and was never claimed by any of the Coshmaing cadet line descendants of Molahiffe, Fieries, or Clonmeallane. Similarly, as those cadet lines became extinct, their baronial-rank lordship titles re-vested in the overlordship of Coshmaing. When that house became extinct, all of the sub-lordship titles also re-vested in the overlordship of MacCarthy M√≥r.

He was the founder and president of Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company  Early life  Inglis Moore Uppercu was born on September 17, 1877 in North Evanston, IL to Jesse Wheat Uppercu and Laura Isabella (Hildebrant) Uppercu. His family moved to New York City in 1888. Uppercu went to the Polytechnic School of Brooklyn and Columbia University Law School.  Automotive career  Starting in 1896, Uppercu was involved in the automotive industry in the New York and New Jersey area. Working initially for the Duryea Motor Wagon Company and the Neostyle Co., in 1902, he established the Motor Car Co. of New Jersey. Through this company, Uppercu sold Autocar, Cadillac and Packard automobiles in the New York-New Jersey area. In 1908, he acquired the New York City Cadillac dealership and reorganized his automotive operations as the Detroit Cadillac Motor Car Co. Uppercu formed a relationship with the custom coach builder Healey & Co. and by the mid-teens, the Detroit Cadillac Motor Car Co was Healey's largest customer. Many of Healey's custom coaches for Cadillac chassis were designed by Uppercu's manager of his custom body department, J.R. McLauchlen. Healey also built bus bodies for Uppercu's Aeromarine Airways for Cadillac and Packard chassis that were used to shuttle passengers from the city to seaplane bases of the airline. When William Mansfield Healey retired in 1923, Uppercu took over his business and moved it to his Aeromarine aircraft factory in Keyport, NJ, renaming it Healey-Aeromarine Bus Company, which continued bus and automobile coach building until 1926. Uppercu found, rehabilitated and, in 1920, donated an 1893 Duryea automobile to the Smithsonian where it is still on exhibit. In 1931, Uppercu sold his automotive operations to General Motors' Cadillac Motor Car Division.  Aeronautical career  Uppercu's interest in aviation dates to 1908 when he was taken for a flight with Frank Boland in one of his innovative tailless biplanes. Impressed, Uppercu invested in, and was the primary financial backer, of the Boland Airplane and Motor Company. After Frank Boland's death in 1913, Uppercu bought out Boland's widow and Boland's brother Joseph's interest in the Borland Aeroplane and Motor Company and, in 1914, renamed it to Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company.Angelucci, Enzo, The American Fighter: The Definitive Guide to American Fighter Aircraft From 1917 to the Present, New York: Orion Books, 1987, p. 37. In 1917, Aeromarine was one of the few companies in the country capable of mass-producing aircraft. The United States Navy, anticipating possible involvement in World War I, and the need for trained pilots, issued one of the first major contracts for 250 aircraft to Aeromarine for its Aeromarine 39 trainer. After the war, the sell off of cheap military surplus aircraft made it very difficult for aircraft manufacturers and, in 1924, Aeromarine ceased production of aircraft and aircraft engines In 1924, Uppercu formed the Uppercu-Burnelli Airplane Co to develop lifting body aircraft designed by Vincent Burnelli. The Aeromarine aircraft patents and designs were transferred to this company. Aeromarine continued as a manufacturer of aircraft instruments and engine starters for the remainder of the 1920s. In 1928, Uppercu and Joseph Boland restarted aircraft production as Aeromarine-Klemm, producing a licensed built version of the Klemm lightweight monoplanes. In 1919, Uppercu formed the genesis of what was to become Aeromarine Airways, by flying sightseeing tours of New York harbor in Aeromarine designed flying boats. Aeromarine Airways became one of the first successful scheduled airline in the United States, using flying boats for regular service from southern Florida to the Bahamas and the Caribbean, and from Cleveland to Detroit Uppercu was actively involved in the promotion and development of aircraft in the post-war years. He was a founding member of both the Manufacturers Aircraft Association and the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce. Uppercu left the aviation business in 1936 and retired from all business operations in 1938.  Personal life  In 1906, he sold a vehicle to Judge Gottfried Krueger, and married his daughter, Ella Krueger, whom he taught to drive in the vehicle. Together, they had 5 daughters. Uppercu was an avid yachtsman. His personal yacht, the clipper rigged Seven Seas, was kept moored on the Hudson River. Uppercu passed away in New York City on April 7, 1944.

It carried the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk & Pontypool Railway line across the River Wye at Monmouth, Wales. A further river crossing by the Ross and Monmouth Railway was later built nearby. The Coleford, Monmouth, Usk & Pontypool Railway was opened in 1857, running from Pontypool to Monmouth Troy. The single-track line was extended in 1861 to Wyesham Halt on the east side of the viaduct. The bridge which was originally planned to carry the line onwards to Coleford. However, the line terminated at Wyesham and was not extended to Coleford as the Great Western Railway and West Midland Railway did not pursue the extension. The bridge was not heavily used until 1876 when the Wye Valley Railway completed its line from Chepstow and south Wales. In 1883 the Coleford Railway was constructed from Wyesham Junction to Coleford but was closed as being uneconomical in 1916.Alan Crow, Bridges on the River Wye, Lapridge Publications, 1995, , Page 138-140 The viaduct was originally planned to be constructed of wood, but the 1852 floods influenced the engineers to change to stone. The building of the viaduct took exactly ten months. It contains 9,000 cubic yards of masonry and 3,000 cubic yards of concrete. Two arches form the 20m long eastern element of the structure. The bridge was designed by Christopher Firbank and built by Kennards of Crumlin. It was about 50 feet above the water and lay on two 150-foot girders resting on the stone arches. Large crowds assembled to watch the bridge being put into place in 1861.Keith Kissack, Victorian Monmouth, The Monmouth Historical and Educational trust, , page 169 Only the stone parts of the viaduct are extant today. Duke of Beaufort Bridge The Ross and Monmouth Railway line opened in 1873 terminating at Monmouth Mayhill railway station. A further single line and three-span bridge of almost 300 feet was constructed to join the two Monmouth railway stations, opening on 1 May 1874. It consists of 3 spans of steel- lattice girders on paired steel tubular piers with squared rubble abutments. The main span is 46 metres long and the shorter spans are 18 metres each. It was built by Edward Finch of Chepstow. The line between Monmouth Troy and Mayhill was closed on 6 January 1964. The R&MR; Duke of Beaufort Bridge remains in use as a footpath. A Sustrans project aims to restore and redeck the bridge as part of improving local cycle connectivity.

He was the tenth Fulani emir, as well as the third emir from the Sullubawa dynasty. He succeeded his father Usman Nagogo, and was succeeded by his son, the current emir Abdulmumini Kabir Usman. Early life and education Kabir was born in January 1928 to the then emir's son Usman Nagogo and his wife Ummulkhair. He was named by Sherif Gudid, an Arab cleric, who was a friend of Nagogo. At an early age, Kabir was enrolled into a Qur'anic school situated within the palace, which was then headed by an Arab scholar, Mohammed Abdullahi, believed to have been hired purposely for that by his grandfather, Emir Muhammadu Dikko. A little later, Kabir moved to further his Quranic studies at Tsamiya, a place in Katsina near the palace. In 1942, at the age of 14, Kabir was admitted into the Katsina Middle School, with 52 others, from across the then Katsina Province. On completion in 1947, he joined the Katsina Native Authority Police and was sent to the Nigeria Police College, Kaduna for a one- year training. Career and Politics Kabir was promoted to Lance Corporal and appointed Wakilin Doka, the Katsina native authority Police chief in 1951 by his father, who had become emir in 1944. In 1953, Kabir went to Lagos for a Criminal Investigation course, and later went to the Police College, London for a similar course. In 1957, he was made the native authority councilor in charge of police, prison and the department of urban water supply. Kabir worked effectively as Police chief, handling one of the delicate police work that arose as a result of a Northern elements progressive union (NEPU) inspired revolt of Sambon Barka in the southern part of the Katsina emirate. He was also made acting Magajin Gari in 1957. He served a member of the boards of many schools and the Gaskiya Corporation, based in Zaria. In 1963, Kabir was confirmed as Magajin Gari, the district head of Katsina metropolis, a title held previously by his father when his grandfather was emir. The same year, Kabir was elected as a member of the House of Assembly, Kaduna. He became a parliamentary secretary in the premier Ahmadu Bello's office in Kaduna in 1965. After the Military coup in 1966, Kabir returned to Katsina and continued to serve as Magajin Gari. Being the Magajin Gari made Kabir very close to his father, he accompanied Nagogo to national conferences and meetings, and sometimes representing him in functions. Kabir also accompanied his father on international visits. Succession as Emir On 18 March 1981, Usman Nagogo died, and the Katsina king-makers chose Kabir to succeed him, being close to his father as magajin Gari, and being his second eldest son (the eldest, Ibrahim Ladan-fari having predeceased Nagogo). The then Governor of Kaduna State, which Katsina was part of then, Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa, refused to approve the choice. This led to a deadlock that lasted until the Governor was impeached by the State house of assembly in June 1981. Balarabe Musa's successor, Abba Musa Rimi, later approved and Kabir was Turbaned at Katsina's Kangiwa square. His official installation was done on the 20th February, 1982 at Katsina Polo Ground. Reign Kabir's reign was characterized by his down to earth nature. Kabir was well educated and knew the Qur'an well, he was therefore considered both as an emir and an Islamic scholar, and was known to have written whole copies of the Qur'an with his hand. Kabir was known by the epithet \\"Limamin Sarakuna dan Shehu\\" (The imam of emirs, the son of Shehu). Kabir also created new districts in the emirate during his reign. One of the highlights of Kabir's reign was the creation of Katsina State, comprising Katsina and Daura emirates, out of the then Kaduna State. Kabir also demolished the famous Masallacin Dutsi, which was built by his grandfather Muhammadu Dikko in 1935, and constructed the Katsina central mosque which is still in use today. Like his father and grandfather, Kabir was a Polo enthusiast, having started playing when he was a teenager, and playing well into his sixties. He became the life President of the Nigerian Polo association, and the Emir of Katsina charity shield tournament was held in his honor. Kabir preached peace and tolerance, and always preached to his subjects to live in peace, he also always tried to remind them of life after death, and God's final judgement. He also received honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Benin, and the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-ife, where he served as Chancellor. Death and Succession As he advanced in age, Kabir became frequently ill, and was often flown out of Nigeria for medical check- ups and treatments. His illness rendered him unable to perform the customary traditional Durbar on the two Eid festivals of 2007. Kabir's illness intensified and he died on 8 March 2008 at the age of eighty, he was survived by 3 wives and many children. Kabir was succeeded that same month by his eldest son, Abdulmumin who had served as Magajin Gari.

Its early influences were from bands such as Celtic Frost and Trouble. History The beginnings of the band date back to early 1985, but it did not stabilize until 1988, after countless member changes. By then, Enrique Zuniga was on the guitar, Patricio \\"Patomic\\" Leiva on drums, Alejandro Diaz on vocals and bass and Jaime Moya on the second guitar. With these members it had its debut on November 26, 1988 in an outdoor show in the center of the city of Santiago de Chile, where it appeared next to Massacre, Darkness, Squad, Nimrod and Anark√≠a. The following year the band recorded their first demo, Bloody Ceremonial, which is considered to be one of the best underground works of the country. This production, which sold over a thousand copies, consisted of four sections (Beyond Reality, Bleed In The Altar, Bloody Ceremonial, and The Session) and enhanced the reputation of the band in both the Chilean national scene and internationally. This success opened the doors for them to participate in numerous concerts including Necro Metal, a typical underground concert of that period held at Villa Alemana, Chile, and the concert of Concepci√≥n in 1989 where they shared the stage with Death Yell, Cerberus and Hades. In 1990, they recorded a promo tape with four songs called Rehearsal. After this recording, the drummer, Patricio Leiva, left the band and was replaced initially by Cristian Gonzalez and then definitively by Pablo Clares. In 1991, after a tour which they undertook with Sadism in northern Chile, they recorded their second demo \\"Resurrection\\". However, in 1992, unable to bounce back from losing their drummer and other internal problems, the band separated, playing for the last time on May 9, 1992, in Valpara√≠so, Chile. Fifteen years later, in 2007, they got back together with Enrique Zuniga on guitar, Alejandro Diaz on vocals and on bass, Pablo Clares on drums and Julio Borquez on second guitar. With this membership, they recorded \\"Rise of the old ones\\". A major presentation took place in June 2011, when they performed, with great success, at the concert of the American Slayer. Atomic Aggressor are still playing together. In February 2015 they performed at the \\"Natales Metal Fest\\" in Puerto Natales with Exanimatvm a death metal band from Punta Arenas, Attaker Bloody Axe from Valdivia and Blasfematorio from Puerto Montt among other bands. So far, this is the southernmost band presentation.

When Otto IV died in 1495, the Waldeck-Landau line died out and its land reverted to Waldeck. Henry VIII and Philip II disputed the Waldeck-Landau inheritance from 1496. Despite the Eternal Landfrieden, which Emperor Maximilian I had declared in 1495, this dispute was initially fought at gunpoint. It was not until 1498 that the two counts agreed to stop fighting and present their case to the newly created Reichskammergericht. In 1507, they settled out of court. The towns of Korbach, Niederwildungen, Sachsenhausen, Sachsenberg and Freienhagen remained shared property, as did the castle, city and districts of Waldeck and Rhoden and the Lordship of Itter. Henry received the city, castle and district of Altwildungen. In all, Henry owned about a third of the family possessions. in 1504, Henry VIII and Philip II with their armies joined Landgrave William II of Hesse in a campaign to implement the imperial ban against the Electorate of the Palatinate. In 1505, they were present at the Diet of Cologne, as part of the Landgrave's entourage. In 1509 some noblemen attacked Henry and his asked the Landgrave in vain for support. In 1512, the Counts of Waldeck joined a newly founded association of counts. Henry died in 1513 and was buried in the Marienthal monastery in Netze (today part of Waldeck).

In 1892, he became principal of a San Bernardino grammar school. The next year he went to study at Harvard University, where he obtained his bachelor's (1896) and masters (1897). Among the professors who influenced him were William James, Nathaniel Shaler, Charles Eliot Norton, and William Gilson Farlow. After graduation, Sargent taught school in Cambridge, and did graduate research on neurology, publishing 10 scientific papers, but quitting before he received his doctorate. For a decade beginning in 1904, Sargent ran a travel school for boys, in which he led tours to Europe and other parts of the world. Publishing and educational criticism In 1915, Sargent began publishing the Handbook of Private Schools.Handbook of Private Schools, book series, 1915‚Äì, Archives from portersargent.com Moehlman wrote that Sargent's \\"annual Forewords to the Handbook of Private Schools gradually evolved into the most comprehensive critiques of education published anywhere.

He has previously played college basketball and was a head coach for Ireland's Super League with the Shamrock Rovers Hoops and the NBA Development League's Utah Flash, Iowa Energy, and Delaware 87ers. He was also an assistant coach for the Utah Valley State College, Oxford College, and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. Early Career Young's own basketball career started in Marietta, Georgia, where he played high school basketball at Sprayberry High School under Coach Roger Kvam. After high school, Young attended Middle Georgia College, a NJCAA establishment. After 2 years, he transferred to Clayton State University, a Division II university, where he was considered a standout guard there. He is still an all-time leader for field goals, assists and three-point shooting at Clayton State. Coaching Experience After finishing his collegiate career, he made his professional head coaching debut at age 23 in Dublin, Ireland with the Shamrock Rovers Hoops in the Super League. Returning to the states after one season, he served as assistant coach at Utah Valley State College, where he helped lead the team to its second most wins in a season. Young also served as an assistant coach for a season at Oxford College of Emory University. After those stints, Young moved on to the NBA D-League, being an assistant coach for the Utah Flash for a season under coach Brad Jones. In 2010, Young was promoted to head coach of the Utah Flash. In that season, he led the team to a 28‚Äì22, including a 9-game winning streak, before losing to the eventual champion Iowa Energy 2‚Äì1 in the first round of that series. After Nick Nurse left the Energy, Iowa decided to name Young their new head coach for 2011. Young then coached the Energy for the next two seasons, having an average record the first season and losing in the first round to the Los Angeles D-Fenders, before having a worse record the second season and being subsequently fired after starting with a 6‚Äì17 record. Young was then named an assistant coach for the Delaware 87ers, the re-branded team name of the Utah Flash, for a season. He was later meant to be a player development coach for the 87ers before the promotion of head coach Rod Baker to scout for the Philadelphia 76ers lead to Young being promoted back to head coach for the newly re-branded franchise. For the next three seasons, he would see incremental improvements with the 87ers, going from 20 wins to 21 wins to 26 wins throughout his second coaching tenure with the franchise. However, he was also instrumental for not just helping Thanasis Antetokounmpo get drafted in the 2014 NBA draft, but also seeing four different players scoring season- highs of at least 45 points throughout his second season, with Christian Wood and Jordan McRae growing to be capable NBA players in their careers not long after. On August 4, 2016, Young was promoted to the role of assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers.https://www.nba.com/sixers/sixers-announce- coaching-staff-updates-2016-17-season/ Outside of an injury plagued first season with the 76ers, in each season afterward, he helped get the 76ers into the playoffs for at least the first round, with highlight appearances in the second round for 2018 and 2019. After Brett Brown was fired in 2020, Young interviewed for the open head coach position before it was ultimately filled by Doc Rivers.https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/report-doc-rivers-named- philadelphia-76ers-next-head-coach/ar-BB19CvDa On October 9, 2020, Young was named assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns, reuniting with head coach Monty Williams there after a season together as assistant coaches with the 76ers.

Its members were previously included in P. japonicus, although it may be more closely related to P. femoristriga. It has been fished for more than 150 years by Japanese fishermen, who call the species aka-ebi. It differs from related species by the lack of banding along the flagella of the first pair of antennae. Distribution The Ogasawara Group, or Bonin Islands, are an outlying archipelago of Japan in the western Pacific Ocean, on the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc. They lie around south of Tokyo, and north of Saipan in the Mariana Islands. P. brunneiflagellum is the dominant Panulirus species around the southern islands in the group, but has also been recorded from Hachijo Island, at the north end of the Izu Ridge, from the Japanese mainland. Description Panulirus brunneiflagellum is a typical spiny lobster. Adults vary in carapace length in the range . The chief distinction between P. brunneiflagellum and related species of spiny lobster is in the colouration of the antennules (first antennae). In P. brunneiflagellum, the bases of the antennules are blackish purple, with white spots around the joints. The flagella are brownish, with no bands of colour. P. longipes bispinosus has paler antennules, and the flagella have four white bands across them. Taxonomy In 1991, Hideo Sekiguchi reported the presence of two distinct forms of Panulirus femoristriga in Japanese waters. These were known to native fishermen as aka-ebi (literally \\"brown whisker\\") and shirahige-ebi (literally \\"white-banded whisker\\"). A third form is known as shironuke-ebi. In 2005, Ray W. George assigned P. brunneiflagellum to an Indo-Pacific group within the genus Panulirus, which also contained P. japonicus, P. cygnus, P. marginatus and P. pascuensis. It was thought to have split from P. japonicus as a result of volcanic activity, either during the formation of the West Mariana fore-arc () or during the extension of the Ogasawara Chain (). Subsequent molecular analyses have suggested that its sister species may instead by P. femoristriga. Ecology Panulirus brunneiflagellum lives in clear, tropical waters at depths of up to , where temperatures are in the range . It lives in open caves, sometimes in association with P. longipes bispinosus, but usually near the entrance, whereas P. l. bispinosus shelters in the depths of the caves. Fishery Japanese settlers colonised the Ogasawara Group in the 1860s, and began fishing P. brunneiflagellum soon after arriving. The fishery uses rectangular steel lobster traps covered in plastic mesh, roughly 1.0 √ó 0.5 √ó 0.5 metres in size. The traps are set daily at depths of , and baited with fresh fish. Up to 24 boats are involved, 20 from Chichi-jima and up to four from Haha-jima. Between them, they catch per year, of which 98% is P. brunneiflagellum (the remainder being P. longipes bispinosus and occasional P. penicillatus); Most of the catch is frozen and dispatched to Tokyo. A closed season is in force in June, July and August, to protect ovigerous (egg- bearing) females. In the absence of any detailed information, P. brunneiflagellum is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.

Mascarenhas and Jose Cosme Costa. These roots are probably the same as those of the Saint Thomas Christians or Nasranis of Kerala. The work of H.O. Mascarenhas H.O. Mascarenhas proposed the theory of pre-Portuguese Christianity in Goa.H.O. Mascarenhas, Konkannachem Apostolik Kristanvponn. In an interview, Mascarenhas reports hearing from his grandmother about pre- Portuguese Christianity in Goa. His grandmother was from Aldona, Goa, where the parish church is dedicated to St. Thomas. She spoke of the equal-armed crosses (still found all over Goa today) without the image of Jesus which is common among Saint Thomas Christians. Mascarenhas himself recalls that the Hindus in Goa used to celebrate 3 July (the feast of Thomas the Apostle) as Dukrana, which he later realized as somehow similar to the Syriac 'Dukrana' which is the feast of the martyrdom of Thomas. He also reports the existence of Christian and Hindu 'Thomses' in Kalyanpuram near Mangalore, probably people who fled or migrated from Goa. Again, in a letter from Goa dated 20 September 1542, four months after his arrival, Francis Xavier writes that the people of the land were greatly devoted to St. Thomas. According to Mascarenhas, this could not have come from the Portuguese, who had no great devotion to Thomas the Apostle. Yet another argument is that Francis Xavier suggests that the Pope be petitioned for a plenary indulgence for the feast of St. Thomas. However, at that time the Latin church celebrated the feast of St. Thomas on 21 December and not on 3 July, which was the date on which Syrian Christians celebrated the feat. Mascarenhas suggests therefore that Francis Xavier had witnessed the celebration of the feast on 3 July; he could not have witnessed a celebration on 21 December, since he had just arrived in Goa in May 1542.Also Hubert O Mascarenhas, interview with the Editor of New Leader which appeared in the Silver Jubilee Souvenir of the Archdiocese of Tellicherry, 1970, see http://thenazrani.org/feasts9.htm Jose Cosme Costa reports that Mascarenhas even proposed that there were Christian temples dedicated to the persons of the Trinity: Abanath / Bhutnath (Father Lord), Ravalnath (from Rabboni - Rabulna - Rabulnath) / Bhai rav (Brother Lord), and Atman / Bhavka Devta, Santeri, Ajadevi (Spirit).H.O. Mascarenhas, Konkannachem Apostolik Kristanvponn, cited by J. Cosme Costa, Apostolic Christianity in Goa and in the West Coast (Pilar, Goa: Xavierian Publication Society, 2009) 67-68. The work of Cosme Jose Costa An archaeological discovery (on 27 April 2001 by Jose Cosme Costa, SFX) of a 'Thomas Cross' hidden in a smallish monument, surmounted by a Latin Cross, near the old Goa harbour (now on the Zuari river, near Aga√ßaim) lends support to this thesis.See the report in Navhind Times (Goa), 13 May 2001. Cosme Jose Costa, historian at Pilar, Goa, has dedicated a recent work to the implications of this discovery: Apostolic Christianity in Goa and in the West Coast. The Cross bears an inscription in Pahlavi, which, Costa reports, was the liturgical language of the church associated with the Metropolitan of Fars.Costa 35.

Also http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/Goa- Goans/message/2222. Cosme Costa speaks of Goa as a trading centre with the Middle East and with Rome. He speaks of the Apostle Thomas making his way over land to Kerala - and it is not implausible that he passed through Goa and the Konkan coast. He also examines the evidence of the Apostle Bartholomew having done more or less the same thing. Cosme Costa's book contains a ch. 6 dedicated to the examination of Pre-Portuguese references to Christianity in Goa. Ch. 7 examines the vestiges of Pre-Portuguese Christian Customs in Goa and the Konkan. Costa also suggests that the 'Betal' worshipped quite commonly in Goa is a corruption of 'Bartholomew'. Ch. 8, finally, is dedicated to the discovery of the 'Thomas Cross' hidden in a smallish monument, surmounted by a Latin Cross, near the old Goa harbour. A storm seems to have split open the structure, revealing the Thomas Cross within. What then happened to this early Christianity, if it did exist? Costa proposes that the Portuguese destroyed the vestiges and forcibly assimilated these Christians to their own (Latin) form of Christianity. Those who resisted were among those who fled Goa.

It came to national prominence when its bonds were the subject of a scandal involving Republican presidential candidate James G. Blaine in 1876. Operations The original shareholders of the Little Rock and Fort Smith wished to create a mode of transit not tied to the level of the Arkansas River and saw an opportunity to do so when they received a federal land grant in 1853.Thompson, p. 4 Although the road was, as the name suggests, initially intended to connect the cities of Little Rock and Fort Smith, Arkansas, the railroad's president, Jesse Turner, and chief engineer, J.H. Haney, hoped to one day use the road to build a network as far as the Atlantic Ocean. Financial conditions following the Panic of 1857 meant that progress was delayed and by 1860 the railroad was out of money.Thompson, p. 5 The Arkansas General Assembly advanced them $38,000 that year, but the outbreak of the American Civil War effectively halted construction the next year. After the war, the state legislature passed a railroad aid bill in 1867, but Turner believed it would be inadequate to their needs, and sought aid from Northern capitalists. Turner resigned in 1868, but the new president, Charles G. Scott, managed to secure some investors' interest the following year.Thompson, p. 6 After replacing some directors to accommodate the investors' demands, the railroad prepared to, at last, begin construction.Thompson, p. 7 Construction had been so long delayed that the federal land grant was set to expire, but Arkansas Congressman Logan H. Roots convinced Speaker James G. Blaine to help him to pass a bill extending the deadline to April 28, 1870. The railroad was then re-incorporated and granted $1.5 million in state bonds to aid the construction efforts. To facilitate construction, Haney hired Asa P. Robinson, a Connecticut-born civil engineer.Thompson, p. 9 Robinson effectively took over the construction process and reorganized the labor force, bringing in white laborers from Illinois to replace the black laborers the railroad had already hired.Thompson, p. 9 Ironically, the variable flows of the Arkansas River delayed construction further when the river was too low to transport heavy equipment, but by February 1870 the first 20 miles were nearly complete. By April 23, enough track was laid to secure the land grant.Thompson, p. 11 By September 29 of that year, thirty-seven miles of track were complete.Thompson, p. 12 Regular passenger service from Little Rock to Lewisburg began on November 21, 1870, a distance of 50 miles.Thompson, p. 13 By 1871, the Little Rock and Fort Smith was once again in financial trouble and Robinson resigned as engineer.Thompson, pp. 14‚Äì15 The company was re-organized again in 1872 and issued new bonds.Thompson, pp. 18‚Äì19 The tracks extended as far as Clarksville in June 1873, but the railroad was bankrupt by November 1874. Blaine and the Mulligan letters Among the Northern investors in the Little Rock and Fort Smith was James G. Blaine, and his alleged sale of the bonds to the Union Pacific Railroad became the subject of a scandal when he was running for President in 1876.Crapol, p. 44; Muzzey, pp. 83‚Äì84; Thompson, pp. 3, 19 Rumors began to spread in February of that year that Blaine had been involved in a transaction with the Union Pacific in which the railroad had paid Blaine $64,000 for some Little Rock and Fort Smith bonds, even though the railroad's financial state rendered the bonds almost worthless; in essence, the alleged transaction was a sham designed to bribe Blaine. Blaine denied the charges, as did the Union Pacific's directors.Muzzey, pp. 84‚Äì86 Blaine claimed he never had any dealings with the Little Rock and Fort Smith except to purchase bonds at market price, and that he had lost money on the transaction. Democrats in the House of Representatives nevertheless demanded a Congressional investigation.Muzzey, pp. 87‚Äì93; Crapol, p. 44; Summers, pp. 62‚Äì63 The testimony appeared to favor Blaine's version of events until May 31, when James Mulligan, a Boston clerk formerly employed by Blaine's brother-in-law, testified that the allegations were true, that he had arranged the transaction, and that he had letters to prove it. When the investigating committee recessed, Blaine met with Mulligan in his hotel room; what transpired between the men is unknown, but Blaine left with the letters and refused to turn them over to the committee. Blaine emerged from the scandal tarnished, and was unable to secure the Republican nomination in 1876.Crapol, p. 45 When he ran again in 1884, the scandal reemerged and harmed his campaign once more.Summers, pp. 62‚Äì63 Notes Sources   Category:Defunct Arkansas railroads Category:Railway companies established in 1853 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1875 ","title":"Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad"},{"id":"34360134","text":"Cham-e Divan (, also Romanized as Cham-e Dƒ´vƒÅn) is a village in Veysian Rural District, Veysian District, Dowreh County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

The group came in second place in the third season of the NBC musical competition The Sing-Off, losing to international a cappella sensations Pentatonix. History Dartmouth College's oldest a cappella singing group, the Aires were originally formed as the Injunaires in 1946 as an offshoot of the college Glee Club; the Dartmouth Aires broke with the Glee Club in the late 1970s.The Dartmouth Aires: A Little History Although the Aires usually have about eighteen members, group numbers vary on a term-to-term basis. Auditions are held at the beginning of every fall term. Members of the Aires pick what songs to arrange based on the group's tastes. Because the Aires are such a diverse group of people, they end up singing a lot of different styles. Currently, much of their repertoire consists of popular songs from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, but it also includes many traditional Dartmouth songs, a few 1950s and 1960s tunes, selected hip hop tracks, and the occasional musical theater piece. Most of the arrangements consist of a soloist, a dozen or so background singers, and a vocal percussionist. The background of arrangements consists of a series of complex \\"instrument-like\\" syllables that, when sung together, resemble the background of the original song. Traditionally, each group member receives a nickname consisting of two syllables and ending in \\"o\\" that reflects that member's personality. The Aires perform an average of two or three times a term at Dartmouth. They frequently take weekend road-trips, singing and reveling at other colleges, performing for high school music festivals, and entertaining at Dartmouth alumni clubs. Every winter break, the Aires tour the Eastern Seaboard, while traveling further afield every spring. Recent spring tours have taken them to Aruba, Costa Rica, Paris, Italy, Colorado, a few of the Hawaiian Islands, Florida, California, and Hong Kong. Recent Aires accolades include winning the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Award (CARA) for Best All-Male Collegiate Album for both their 2003 (\\"Black Tie Affaire\\") and 2005 (\\"Impaired\\") album releases, as well as selection for Varsity Vocals' Best Of Collegiate A Cappella compilation CD in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2012, and 2015 and selection for the Voices Only compilation CD in 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2011. Their most recent album, On Aire, was released in December 2017. In 2011, they competed in season 3 of The Sing Off, a national reality show. The group performing on the show included 16 of the group's members from the classes of 2010 through 2014. Out of 16 original contestants, they made it to the top three and finished as first runner-up.The Sing Off- Official Site The Sing- Off Performances  The Dartmouth Aires made the following performances.

It was heard in the Cape Provincial Division by Foxcroft J, Moosa J and Selikowitz J on 20 September 2002, with judgment delivered on 27 September. Counsel was the appellant was NM Arendse SC (with him Anton Katz); for the first respondent appeared SP Rosenberg and for the second MA Albertus SC.  Facts  The instant appeal concerned the right of the court to order specific performance of a contract for personal services. Gordon Igesund, a football coach, had entered into a coaching contract with Santos, the appellant club. The contract provided that a breach by either of the parties would entitle the other either to cancel the contract and claim damages, or to claim specific performance. Before the expiry of his contract, Igesund was made a more lucrative offer by Ajax Cape Town, the second respondent, and proceeded to give Santos notice of termination. Santos elected to enforce the contract and sought # a declarator that the contract was binding on the parties; # an order compelling Igesund to continue serving as Santos head coach; and # an order restraining Ajax from taking any action designed to induce Igesund to breach the contract.  Judgment  The court deemed it clear that Igesund's principal reason for leaving Santos was that he had secured a better contract. This was relevant because there is an important distinction between a wrongfully dismissed employee and one who resiles unlawfully from his contract of employment.77G.78I/J - J. Igesund, furthermore, was no ordinary servant of the type in respect of whom the English courts refuse to order specific performance; he was a party contracting on equal terms with his employer and able to command a high sum of money in doing so. The court was also not being asked to order specific performance against an employer, but to declare that a contract was binding and to allow Santos to proceed to enforce its contract against an unwilling employee who wished to earn more money elsewhere.79D - E/F. It is generally accepted that it is an injured plaintiff's right to elect whether to hold a defendant to his contract or to claim damages for breach. Igesund had no right to prescribe how Santos would make the election provided by law.81E/F - H. The English common law regards specific performance as supplementary to the remedy of damages; it is never granted where damages provide adequate relief. This rule is based on public policy and the sense that it is improper to make a person serve another against his will. South African law, in contrast, regards specific performance as a primary remedy, not a supplementary one.84E - I/J. While Igesund might not want to go back to coach Santos, an order of specific performance would not amount to compelling him to do something against his will. The fact that relations between Santos and Igesund had soured did not detract from the basic fact that Igesund had chosen to break the contract. He had thereby brought all subsequent unpleasantness between him and Santos upon himself.84I/J - 85B. There was no inequity, the court held, in obliging Igesund to adhere to his contract. Only Santos, which had chosen to take the risk of bringing an application for an order of specific performance, would be prejudiced if Igesund did not perform properly. In that event, the club had several remedies at hand, the most obvious of which was to stop paying him.85H - J. As to the view that it would not be possible to determine whether Igesund was functioning optimally, the court found that it had a discretion and could refuse specific performance only if it would operate \\"unreasonably hardly on the defendant, or where the agreement giving rise to the claim [was] unreasonable, or where the decree would produce injustice, or would be inequitable under all the circumstances.\\"Haynes v King William's Town Municipality 1951 (2) SA 371 (A) at 378H - 379A. Santos could not be denied its ordinary remedy simply because of the possibility that Igesund might not perform properly, which was a factual issue that would arise only in the future.86B - D/E. It was clear to the court, from Brisley v Drotsky,2002 (4) SA 1 (SCA).Para 94. that courts should be slow in striking down contracts or in declining to enforce them, and should, in specific-performance situations, refuse performance only where a recognised hardship to the defaulting party has been proved. Practical considerations, such as the impossibility of measuring Igesund's performance, did not meet the proper test.86F - I. The court held that the court a quo had failed to apply the principle of election and the primary right to specific performance. It also had not appreciated the import of the remark in Brisley in favour of upholding contracts as opposed to striking them down. These failures amounted to misdirections and an approach on the wrong principles.87A/B - D/E. As to the relief sought against Ajax, the court found nothing to prove that it had induced Igesund to break his contract. The fact that Ajax had made an offer did not in itself prove an inducement. The court a quo therefore had quite correctly refused to make an order against Ajax.87H - I/J. The appeal against Igesund, accordingly, had to succeed, and that against Ajax to fail. There existed a binding agreement between Santos and Igesund, who would have to continue serving as head coach of Santos as dictated by the agreement.88E - G/H. The decision by the single judge in Santos v Igesund2002 (5) SA 697 (C). was thus reversed in part and confirmed in part.  References   Textbooks  * Du Plessis, Jacques, et al.

She was Vice Chair on the House Committee of Human Services. Jordan has a TV show on ‚Äò≈ålelo Community Television called Jordan's Journal.

It is believed that Jordan is the first openly gay legislator in the US to vote against same-sex marriage. In 2014, Jo Jordan was re-elected with 60.7% of the vote in the general election against Cedric Gates (23%) of the Green Party and Allen \\"Al\\" Frenzel (16.2%) of the Libertarian Party.

Life Charles Steffen was born into a family of eight children in Chicago. He studied drawing, art history, and photography at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s. Around 1950, while still in school, he suffered a mental breakdown and was institutionalized at Elgin State Hospital from 1952‚Äì63, undergoing treatments and electroshock therapy for schizophrenia.Stillman, Nick. \\"Charles Steffen,\\" Artforum, Summer 2007 He continued to make art while institutionalized. After leaving the hospital, unable to take a job, Steffen moved into his childhood home with his sister, Rita. Steffen spent most of his time drawing, mainly on brown wrapping paper, with graphite and colored-pencils. When the family house was sold upon his mother‚Äôs death in 1994, Steffen moved into a small room in a men‚Äôs retirement home in northern Chicago. Previously, Rita had instructed him to destroy his piles of drawings now and then, believing them to be a fire hazard. Resource Library Upon his move, Steffen was prepared to throw away a vast body of drawings but instead gave pieces to his nephew, Christopher Preissing, who had shown interest in his work. When they were discovered in storage around 2006 they became a significant part of the newly increased public awareness of Outsider art. Forty years of drawing and smoking had gnarled his body and given his voice a gravelly quality. Before he died, this voice was captured in a recording was made of him reading ‚ÄúJabberwocky‚Äù from Lewis Carroll‚Äôs Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1872), a book both dear and inspirational to him. Work As art, Steffen created drawings for his own personal pleasure, working with brown paper bags and colored pencils, and at the rate of one to three drawings a day. Russell Bowman Art Advisory All of the work that the artist created before 1989 has been destroyed.Stillman, Nick. \\"Charles Steffen,\\" Artforum, Summer 2007 His drawings derive mostly from memory, his brief art school education, and from within his limited sphere of existence (when not drawing, Steffen spent his time pacing the house while smoking or drinking). His personal, more quotidian subject matter included: the bank teller, neighbors, plants from the yard, etc. Beyond this immediate sphere, Steffen‚Äôs subject matter extended to the past and the general: his mother, her wheelchair and bed; showgirls from the bar he frequented during his school days; scenes from Elgin, Illinois; a woman he had loved before his hospitalization; female nudes and crucifixions. Steffen experimented with his repeated subject matter; he began to merge the human form with plants or with the abstract tobacco stains and tar splotches he saw on neighborhood sidewalks. His human figures began to merge as well, encompassing both male and female characteristics. In his later years, Steffen wrote notes in the margins of the drawings. His notes varied from thanks to God, to recollections and observations, to the mundane (what he had just eaten, how much he paid for art supplies, etc.). The following is an excerpt from the text on Alisha Nude from 1994: \\"I'm an art school drop out stoped [sic] going to classes, became mentally ill, spent foreteen [sic] years in elgin state hos, made crayon drawing of the men on the ward, good, small, nice, I wish I had them, I wish I was dead, chas.\\" Exhibitions *2006: Russell Bowman Art Advisory, Chicago, IL *2008: Galerie Objet Trouv√©, Paris; Russell Bowman Art Advisory, Chicago, IL *2010: Life Lines: The Drawings of Charles Steffen, Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, Chicago *2012: Galerie Christian Berst, Paris *2013: Collection de L‚ÄôArt Brut, Lausanne, Switzerland References Sources * Information page on artnet.com * Bonesteel, Michael.

The book is the eighth historical detective novel featuring the fictional character Erast Fandorin. Plot A naive young woman, Masha Mironova, travels from provincial Russia to Moscow, where she changes her name to Columbine and joins the Lovers of Death, a small group of bohemian poets, each of them eagerly waiting their turn to die a romantic fin de si√®cle death by suicide. Once one member dies, their replacement is found by the leader of the group, the Doge. Another newcomer to the society appears to be a Japanese prince, although this turns out to be Erast Fandorin acting undercover. Fandorin is not the only person to have connected the suicides and the group: a newspaper reporter, Zhemailo, has also done so and he also dies a mysterious death. Fandorin uncovers that many of the suicides are murders, all committed by the Doge: in the process of his investigation Columbine also falls in love with Fandorin and becomes his mistress. Release and reception She Lover of Death was published in the UK in October 2009 by Weidenfeld & Nicolson; the hardback copy was 272 pages. In September 2010 Weidenfeld & Nicolson published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which also ran to 272 pages. She Lover of Death achieved generally favourable reviews. Marcel Berlins, writing in The Times noted that \\" Akunin is not out to achieve verisimilitude. What he delivers is an absurdly imaginative story, surreal and comic. His characters are outrageous and thoroughly unbelievable. Fandorin is an impossibly heroic figure. The combination is irresistible.\\" John Thornhill, reviewing the novel in the Financial Times thought the book to be \\"conventional and self- indulgently enjoyable\\" Thornhill considers that the story is \\"steeped in the classics of Russian literature\\", whilst he considers that Akunin \\"toys with the styles and conventions of Russia‚Äôs illustrious late-19th-century writers.\\" Overall, Thornhill saw She Lover of Death to be an \\"artfully constructed novel [which] also nods in the direction of Arthur Conan Doyle\\". The Reviewer for The Sunday Times wrote that the Fandorin was an \\"engagingly original series\\" which was \\"a fascinating mixture of pathos and pastiche; his characters are larger than life but never absurd.\\" they went on to say that She Lover of Death \\"is as ingenious as the earlier Fandorin novels, and full of clever and unexpected twists.\\" Reviewing for the Australian newspaper The Courier-Mail, Cheryl Jorgensen considered that, with Akunin has a \\"tone throughout is light, as though he doesn't take himself too seriously and this gives the tale its appeal\\"; overall she considered the book to be \\"an absorbing tale from Imperial Russia that is sure to delight\\".

The club was founded in 1912 and competes in Auckland Rugby League competitions. Its premier team competes in the Sharman cup. The club celebrated its centenary Queen's Birthday weekend, 2012. History The club was formed as the Ellerslie Wanderers at a meeting in April 1912 at the Ellerslie Hotel. However, with the outbreak of World War I in 1914 the club went into temporary recess for four years.History ellerslieleague.co.nz The club was reestablished on 26 July 1919 as the Ellerslie United Rugby League Club. With its reestablishment, the club adopted the Red, Blue and White colours that it still currently uses. In 1931, at request of the Auckland Rugby League, an amalgamation of the Ellerslie, Otahuhu and Mangere clubs took place, but all plans of this merger were abandoned before the year ended. The club had a golden period in the 1950s, claiming the 1955 Roope Rooster and Stormont Shield, the 1956 Roope Rooster, the 1957 Fox Memorial and Rukutai Shield and the 1959 Roope Rooster and Stormont Shield. The club also played against three clubs from the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, losing to the Balmain Tigers 35‚Äì7 in 1956, defeating the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 16‚Äì15 in 1958 and losing to the St. George Dragons 10‚Äì11 in 1959. During the 1960s the Auckland Rugby League instituted a districts programme and Ellerslie, City Newton and Eastern Suburbs combined to form Eastern Districts. The combination won almost every trophy between 1960 and 1963 before the clubs regained their separate identities. In 1968 the Pakuranga club was formed as a feeder club to Ellerslie. Former New Zealand national rugby league team representative Maurie Robertson was appointed as coach in 1970. The club officially adopted the Eagles name in 1971. During the 1980s the club bounced between the first and second divisions, with Sharman Cup (second division) wins in 1981 and 1986. They again lifted the Sharman Cup in 1991 and 1992. The club was affiliated to the Auckland City Vulcans during the 1994 Lion Red Cup and joined the Eastern Tornadoes side with the advent of the Bartercard Cup in 2000. In 2004 the club left the Tornadoes to become part of the Otahuhu- Ellerslie Leopards side in the Bartercard Cup.

It was released worldwide on January 12, 2012. The game was announced two days prior to its release, and is the second release from 5th Cell for the iOS platform. The game's plot revolves around a mother kangaroo in search of her captured joey. The game takes place in Australia, where Roo travels from Perth to Sydney. Run Roo Run is unique in its gameplay for modern platform games in that it is not a side-scrolling video game. Each level is a single screen that introduces a new element of complexity. For this reason, 5th Cell refers to the game's genre as \\"micro-platformer\\". It features Game Center integration, but is a single-player title. Gameplay Gameplay in Run Roo Run is simplistic in control. Since the game employs auto-run, the player controls Roo only in the character's jumping movements. While a platform game, Run Roo Run is unique in that it is not a side-scrolling video game. Each level is a single screen that introduces new elements of complexity. Each chapter of the game consists of several levels, in which different grades can be achieved depending on the time a player takes to complete each level. A completed chapter represents a move East on the map, and an \\"Extreme\\" set of levels are unlocked for each chapter. Development After playing the game Flash Space is Key by independent developer Chris Jeff, director Jeremiah Slaczka gained inspiration for creating a new video game. Slaczka conceived of the game's basic concept several months prior to game development. Development for Run Roo Run began in September 2011. It was originally meant to be a much smaller project for 5th Cell, with only six weeks of projected development time. However, an additional three months was necessary to complete the game as it became larger-scale. The game was released worldwide on January 12, 2012 for iOS. The game marks 5th Cell's first new game series since Scribblenauts was released, and is 5th Cell's first self-published title. Reception IGN's Justin Davis praised Run Roo Runs gameplay, noting that \\"the bite-sized nature of each stage is genius.\\" When discussing the overall game, he stated that \\"Run Roo Run looks, sounds and plays great.\\" However, video game magazine Edge gave the game a mixed review; \\"It's becoming a 5th Cell tradition: strong ideas compromised by erratic level design and structural weaknesses. One day, the developer will find the right balance to support its undeniable creativity, but sadly, it hasn't found it here.\\" 1UP.com's Chris Pereira stated \\"the music does become grating as you play (if you play for long enough in one sitting), and the standard levels can be too easy and ask too little of you at times. But the game is made so well for the platform -- you can pick it up, play a level, and go back to what you were doing 30 seconds later, or sit there for an hour -- that it's not difficult to look past those issues.\\" References External links *Run Roo Run official website Category:2012 video games Category:5th Cell games Category:IOS games Category:GameClub games Category:IOS-only games Category:Platform games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Fictional kangaroos and wallabies Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Run Roo Run"},{"id":"34360448","text":"Leovigildo Briones Banaag (December 31, 1943 ‚Äì January 6, 2011) was a lawyer and a Congressman in the Philippine House of Representatives for 3 consecutive terms from 1998 to 2007.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History Opening in 1916, the Northwestern Hotel was built to serve the needs of railroad employees and passengers from the nearby Chicago and North Western depot, and other people of modest means. It was particularly popular with people during the Iowa State Fair. with The hotel also had an arrangement with the railroad to accommodate its employees in their rooms. This building replaced a previous hotel with the same name in the same location. It was built by Otto Starzinger, whose parents Frank and Anna built and ran the hotel before him. Other businesses housed on the first floor included a restaurant, cigar stand, and a drug store. Eventually, the building went into a slow period of decline before Polk County officials forced it to close in 1982. A group of lawyers remodeled the building for office use in 1983. The building currently houses retail space on the first floor. Architecture The building was designed by the prominent Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson. It is a three-story structure with a decorative cornice at the roofline. Most of the building's decorations were limited to the lobby of the hotel when it was constructed. The first floor housed retail space in addition to the hotel's lobby. A ballroom, with its own skylight, and guest rooms were on the second floor. The guest rooms of the second and third floor were generally small and were arranged around spaces with skylights. Some of the larger suites, which had a view of the capitol building, had their own bathrooms. The other guest rooms shared bathrooms. The building was originally designed to be six stories high, but it had to be scaled back to three. However, the underpinnings of the building exist to support additional stories, and cast concrete supports and a fourth- floor fireplace are located in the attic.

History Wallasey Corporation Tramways Wallasey Corporation Tramways was a direct successor of the Wallasey United Tramway and Omnibus Company, which had provided horse-drawn tramway services in Wallasey since 1879. The Wallasey Tramways and Improvements Act, 1899, gave the Corporation the power to obtain the tramway company, which it did on 1 April 1901 for the price of ¬£20,500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ).. This included seven 34-seater double deck tramcars, and 78 horses. The Corporation relaid the track and on 17 March 1902, the first line was opened, from Seacombe Ferry to New Brighton Ferry via Wheatland. Two days later the direct route from Seacombe to New Brighton via Seabank Road was opened, replacing a horse bus service. On 17 May 1902 a third line was opened from Seacombe to New Brighton via Brighton Drive, Church Street, Liscard Road, Seaview Road and Warren Drive. The depot was in Seaview Road. The contractor for the system was R.W. Blackwell and Co. Fleet Car 78 The Wallasey tramway rolling stock consisted at maximum of 78 cars which were delivered at intervals between 1902 and 1920.

In April 2011, an anonymous group of Wall Street bankers who lost friends in the 9/11 attacks commissioned a large, tall version. It was dedicated on Veteran's Day, November 11, 2011, in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lt. Gen. John Mulholland, commander of Task Force Dagger and U.S. Army Special Operations Command during Operation Enduring Freedom. The statue commemorates the service members of America's Special Operations forces and their response to 9/11, including those who fought during the first stages of the Afghanistan war. This operation led to the initial defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Background  The Special Operations team was inserted into Afghanistan at night aboard two MH-47 Chinook helicopters. The artist, sculptor Douwe Blumberg, had been a horse trainer for 18 years and is a military history buff. He has completed more than 200 private and public commissions and has received numerous awards. He was inspired to begin the sculpture by a photo that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld displayed at a press conference at the Naval Training Center Great Lakes, Illinois, on 16 November 2001, shortly after U.S. forces entered Afghanistan. As part of Operation Enduring Freedom, President George W. Bush sent covert forces into Afghanistan to help the Northern Alliance defeat the Taliban. The group, named Task Force Dagger, was a joint Special Operations team consisting of Green Berets from the 5th Special Forces Group, aircrew members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (\\"Nightstalkers\\"), and Air Force Combat Controllers.  Flight into Afghanistan  The 12-man Operational Detachment Alpha 595 (ODA 595) team, along with two Air Force combat controllers, were the second group of Task Force Dagger to enter Afghanistan. In the first operation of its kind, they were flown from a former Soviet airbase, now named the Karshi-Khanabad Air Base, in Uzbekistan more than across the Hindu Kush mountains in zero-visibility conditions by a SOAR MH-47E Chinook helicopter. They were dropped onto a farmer's field at 0200 on October 19, 2001, about south of Mazar-i-Sharif in the Dari-a-Souf Valley, south of Mazar-e-Sharif. The team arrived only 39 days after the Al-Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center for what they thought would be a year-long stay. page 127ff They linked up with the Northern Alliance led by General Dostum.  Horseback transportation  Once they arrived in-country, they needed transportation suitable to the difficult mountainous terrain of Northern Afghanistan. The Afghan tribes offered the men the only transportation available: small Afghan horses. Only two men had any experience on horseback. Capt. Mark Nutsch, commander of ODA-595, who grew up on a ranch riding horses, gave quick lessons to the others. Capt. Will Summers, Special Forces team leader, said \\"It was as if The Jetsons had met The Flintstones.\\" The mostly inexperienced riders soon requested replacements for the traditional small, hard, wooden saddles used by the Afghanistan soldiers. A supply of lightweight, Australian-style saddles was air-dropped in mid- November. The last U.S. Army unit to fight on horseback was the U.S. Army's 26th Cavalry Regiment. On January 16, 1942, Troop G encountered Japanese forces at the village of Morong and Lieutenant Edwin P. Ramsey ordered a cavalry charge. The last troops to receive training on riding horseback was the 28th Cavalry in 1943.  Initial attack against Taliban  On October 21, the Northern Alliance led by General Dostum prepared to attack the fortified village of Bishqab, defended by Taliban equipped with several T-54/55 tanks, a number of BMPs (armored personnel carriers) armed with cannons and machine guns, and several ZSU-23 anti-aircraft artillery. The Northern Alliance totaled about 1,500 cavalry and 1,500 light infantry. They were assisted by the 12-member U.S. Special Forces team and American air power. To reach the enemy, they crossed a mile-wide open plain cut by seven ridges that would leave them completely exposed to enemy fire. To the U.S. Special Forces, it looked like the Charge of the Light Brigade, Battle of Fredericksburg, and Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg, all at the same time. Supported by American air power and precision-guided munitions, they successfully attacked the Taliban, many of whom threw away their weapons and ran. The next day, the Northern Alliance prepared to attack C≈çbaki, Balkh Province, south of Mazar-i-Sharif. The U.S. Special Ops teams used SOFLAM Laser Target Designators to identify targets for air strikes on the enemy armor and artillery. The Northern Alliance followed this with a horse cavalry charge. When it looked like Dostum's cavalry charge would fail, several members of ODA 595 rode into action and helped win the battle. \\"It was like out of the Old Testament,\\" commented Lt. Col. Max Bowers, former commander of three Special Forces horseback teams. \\"You expected Cecil B. DeMille to be filming and Charlton Heston to walk out.\\"  Soldier photo  U.S. Special Operations, members of ODA 595 and Force Dagger, and Afghan forces on horseback in northern Afghanistan during October 2001. This photo inspired Blumberg to create the sculpture. During a news conference on November 15, 2001 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld displayed a photo of ODA 595 riding across a field on Afghan horses. When sculptor Blumberg saw that image, he said he was \\"riveted\\" and felt impressed that he had to do something. \\"The visual irony of a 21st-century, high-tech trooper mounted on a ragged Afghan mountain horse, unchanged for centuries, fascinated me.\\" Despite the array of high-tech military gear they carried into battle, it was the trusty Afghanistan stallions that were essential to the campaign's success. The mounted US troops became known as the \\"horse soldiers\\".  Production   Initial design  Air Force combat controller Staff Sgt. Bart Decker on an Afghan horse was a model for Blumberg when he began to design the statue. Decker rode with the U.S. Special Ops teams and Northern Alliance forces during the opening days of Operation Enduring Freedom. After seeing the photo of the modern soldiers on horseback, Blumberg decided to create a statue to commemorate the actions of the service members of America's Special Operations who responded to the 9/11 attacks, including the Special Operations forces who fought in the early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom. On his own initiative and expense, Blumberg took three months to complete a 1:6 scale, tall bronze sculpture of a Green Beret riding an Afghan horse. In 2002, while at a show in Louisville, Kentucky, he brought the work in progress with him. A Vietnam-era Green Beret saw the work and told Lt. Col. Frank Hudson from the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell about the statue, who called Blumberg. Blumberg sent him pictures of the work. Hudson saw a number of inconsistencies in the statue with the reality of what happened in the field.  First version produced  Blumberg was invited to Fort Campbell where he met members of the team who had only recently returned from Afghanistan. Capt. Mark Nutsch, commander of ODA-595, who grew up on a ranch riding horses, helped critique the statue for Blumberg. Blumberg soon learned that the statue he thought was finished was extremely inaccurate and needed considerable additional work. The soldiers showed Blumberg the indigenous horse tack made out of dried sinew that they had brought back from the war. Blumberg got the men's phone numbers and began collaborating with them to produce a highly accurate representation of a member of their team on horseback. Blumberg invited some of them to his studio where they worked closely with him.  Small version made  Blumberg took another three months to re-sculpt the piece until he was sure he got the horse and soldier precisely correct. \\"This job is something I'm emotional about,\\" Blumberg said. \\"This allows me to honor soldiers, capture a unique aspect of their service and then have the opportunity to put it in New York. I couldn't have scripted it better. This is super powerful for me.\\" Blumberg cast 120 pieces for public sale and another 120 for sale at cost to members of the special forces. On March 5, 2004, he presented a copy of his completed work to the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Museum, the regimental museum for the U.S. Army Special Forces at Fort Bragg. In 2003, the non-profit Foundation for US Historical Monuments was formed to help build a monumental version, but their efforts came to nothing.  Wall Street backers  Eight years later, in March 2011, he received a call from a group of New York City Wall Street bankers who lost friends and co-workers in the 9/11 attacks. Two of the individual Wall Street supporters said they were asked by families and friends if there was a place that individuals could go to remember the U.S. troops overseas who daily combat potential terrorist threats. \\"We wanted to do something for the special operations community and all military service branches, because every day since 9/11, we've had to look at that hole in the ground,\\" one of the private backers says. \\"What everyone needs to know is: There are people out there like this team, like the Green Berets, that are willing to sacrifice at all costs for them.\\"  Large-scale version cast  The bankers wanted a large-scale version to lead the Veterans Day parade only six months later. They commissioned Blumberg to build a monument to be placed near Ground Zero, paying $500,000 for the work. The Gary Sinese Foundation and the Green Beret Foundation supported the effort to build the monument. No public funds were used. Blumberg lives in DeMossville, Kentucky. However, much of the work on the bronze monument was done by the Crucible Foundry in Norman, Oklahoma, a full-service foundry specializing in monumental bronze. To get the work completed in time for the November 11 parade, Blumberg spent many weeks on-site at the foundry.  Description  Blumberg puts the finishing touches on the full-size clay model of the horse soldier sculpture before the bronze work is begun. The life-and-a-half scale, bronze statue is tall including a tall granite plinth. The base bears the sculpture's title, \\"America's Response Monument.\\" The statue is sub-titled De Oppresso Liber, which is Latin for 'to liberate the oppressed', the motto of the Green Berets. It depicts a Special Forces Green Beret on horseback leading the invasion into Afghanistan. He is holding field glasses in one hand. An M4A1 equipped with picatinny rails around the gun barrel with the upper receiver, an ACOG 4x rifle sight at the upper receiver, an AN/PEQ-2 laser sight at the right side of the barrel, a 30 round STANAG magazine and an attached M203 grenade launcher under the barrel is slung under his right shoulder. An outline of a wedding band is visible under the glove of the soldier's left hand. Blumberg said, \\"That's my way of tipping my hat to wives, marriages and strain on families. It's to acknowledge the stresses caused by multiple deployments.\\" Blumberg created the sculpture's face without using a model or photos. It does not represent the face of a specific individual. The small, Afghan \\"Lokai\\" horse shows \\"Tersk\\" breeding, indicating a horse of Eastern European heritage descended from horses brought in by the Soviets in the 1980s. In the Afghan culture, the soldiers only ride stallions into battle. The horses could be difficult to control, and the statue depicts the horse rearing back. The horse tack depicted by Blumberg is traditional to the Aghani people. A tasseled breast collar helps keep the flies off the chest and legs. The statue's base reflects the steep, precipitous slopes the soldiers often traveled on horseback.  World Trade Center steel  During the battle against the Taliban, each Green Beret ODA team carried a piece of steel recovered from the rubble of the World Trade Center in honor of the 9/11 victims. Later during the war, they each buried their piece of steel at a significant point in the battle. Bowers chose Mazar-i-Sharif as the location to bury his piece of the World Trade Center. This was the location of one of their toughest battles and where CIA officer Mike Spann became the first American killed in action in Afghanistan. Like the soldiers it honors, the statue carries a piece of steel from the World Trade Center. It is visible under the plinth, embedded in the base. The monument's inscription states that the steel \\"symbolizes the connection between the events of 9/11 and the actions of the special operations heroes this monument honors.\\"  Dedication  The statue was introduced to the public during the Veteran's Day Parade in New York City on November 11, 2011. The statue was displayed on a float which led the parade along Fifth Avenue from 23rd Street north to 56th Street. It was dedicated the same day in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lt. Gen. John Mulholland, commander of Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan. New York City ironworkers who had helped build the World Trade Center were among those who helped transport, move, and install the statue temporarily in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero. It is the first publicly accessible monument to United States special forces. The Special Warfare Memorial Statue, commemorating the actions of Green Beret forces in the Vietnam War, was placed on Meadows Memorial Field at Fort Bragg, North Carolina on November 19, 1969, but all visitors must pass through base security.Howlett, D. Roger, The Sculpture of Donald De Lue: Gods, Prophets, and Heroes, David R. Godine, Publisher, Boston 1990 p. 143 The land at One World Trade Center for the monument was donated by a private Wall Street firm.  Rededication at One World Trade Center  The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye over the World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony. At its rededication, the statue's entire cost of over $750,000 had been paid by hundreds of private citizens.  Moved to Liberty Park  On September 13, 2016, the statue was rededicated once again at a permanent site on an elevated space on the south side of Ground Zero in Liberty Park, a park in Lower Manhattan. The park was built on top of the World Trade Center's Vehicular Security Center and overlooks the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.  In popular culture  In 2009, Disney bought the movie rights to Doug Stanton's book Horse Soldiers and Jerry Bruckheimer began seeking financing in December 2011. The 2018 war drama film 12 Strong, directed by Nicolai Fuglsig and written by Ted Tally and Peter Craig, was released on January 19, 2018. The statue is featured in the final few moments of the film before the credits are shown.

It was first isolated from Vi√ßosa, Minas Gerais (Atlantic Forest), on Camponotus balzani. This species was formerly thought to be Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, which has subsequently been divided into four species. O. camponoti-balzani infects ants, and eventually kills the hosts after they move to an ideal location for the fungus to spread its spores. This has earned the species names such as ‚Äúzombie fungus‚Äù, given the fungus has been observed to cause its hosts to bite hard into the substrate it stands on, so that the fungus can then stably grow. Description This species mycelium is a chocolate brown colour, and forms aggregations around the insects' joints, especially on legs and antennae. Its stromatal morphology is similar to O. camponoti-rufipedis, but its fertile region is dark brown when mature. Its ascomata are semi-erumpent and flask- shaped, measuring up to , and possessing a pronounced neck. Its asci are 8-spored, hyaline and cylindrical, while its ascospores are multiserriate, thin-walled and rounded at their base.

History The eastern two commercial blocks were built by Duane DeVotie and George R. Baker. Baker opened his grocery store in the commercial space of at least the corner block, but it probably took up both. DeVotie, who owned the land the building was constructed on, built the third commercial block in 1883 at the same time as the Hollingsworth Brothers Block to the west was built. The buildings housed a variety of business over the years. At the end of the 19th century, it housed drug and grocery stores. After that, it housed funeral parlors and furniture stores. The Spring Hub Bicycle Manufacturing Company occupied the western storefronts from 1912 to 1967. It was the only Des Moines company that manufactured bicycles. The upper floor of the corner block housed professional offices, and apartments were located on the upper floor of the Devotie Block. In 1922 the exterior was faced with cement and scored to look like stone. It was at this time that the original window hoods were lost. with Restoration to its original appearance began in 1976.

History Before the Belgians arrived in the region the local Banyali people used gold to make jewellery, but otherwise did not see the metal as commercially valuable. The Belgians found gold about from Mongbwalu in 1903 and began commercial exploitation of Kilo-Moto gold resources in 1905. From 1926 to 1966, mining operations were controlled by the Societe des Mines d'Or de Kilo-Moto (SOKIMO). During the colonial era about 1.3 million ounces of gold were extracted from the Mongbwalu area. Soon after independence, in 1967 the government nationalized SOKIMO. Production quickly declined due to lack of investment and exploration, dropping to under 15,000 ounces per year. In 1981, mining in the region was opened to private enterprise, causing rapid growth in artisanal mining as well as formal commercial mining by foreign companies. Gold mining resumed its decline in the 1980s and 1990s. Industrial gold production was affected by the First Congo War from October 1996 to May 1997 and halted by the Second Congo War from August 1998 to May 2003. In 2002 and 2003 there were a series battles between rival armed groups over Mongbwalu in which 2,000 civilians died. In some cases civilians were killed because they were Hema or Lendu people. The town changed hands five times. The Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) Lendu militia emerged the winner. The FNI controlled Mongbwalu and its gold mines until the middle of 2005, using the gold to pay its troops and to buy supplies and weapons. Concession 40 covers surrounding Mongbwalu, and includes the underground Adidi, Makala and Senzere mines. AngloGold Ashanti Kilo, a joint venture between AngloGold Ashanti and the government-owned OKIMO, gained the rights to concession 40, starting exploration in November 2003 and expanding its activities as the UN and DRC government regained and consolidated control over the region. In a major 2005 report, Human Rights Watch accused AngloGold Ashanti Kilo of providing assistance to the FNI during the 2003-2005 period in exchange for gold concessions. The company denies any wrongdoing. The company has provided assistance to the local hospital and schools, and has helped with road repair and drainage works. After further negotiations with OKIMO, in 2010 AngloGold Ashanti began a feasibility study for a proposed mine near Mongbwalu. Demographics Mongbwalu lies within the Kilo-Moto region and has long been a center of gold mining, with three nearby underground industrial mines: Adidi, Senzere and Makala. As of 2008 the town had a population of about 50,000, mostly Banyali and Lendu, but with people from many other ethnic groups who have been attracted by the gold mining opportunities. Around 25,000 to 30,000 men, women and children in the region around Mongbwalu were engaged in gold mining, transport and processing. Much of the gold extracted in Mongbwalu is traded across the border to Uganda. Economy Mining operations Gold is found in river beds and topsoils as flecks or small nuggets of 90-95% pure gold, and is also extracted from crushed rocks obtained from underground and open-pit mines. The Adidi underground mine directly or indirectly employed about 5,000 people in various jobs. In December 2007 these people were thrown out of work when the Orientale Province governor Medard Autsai Asenga ordered the mine to close. The abandoned Senzere and Makala underground mines are still being worked informally in extremely difficult and dangerous conditions. In 2007 there were about 33 pit mining sites near Mongbwalu, each with several pits, some with several thousand miners. The pits may be up to deep. Mud slides and flooding are commonplace. Alluvial mining is also practiced in rivers and riparian areas, although productivity is declining. Many of the rivers have been diverted to form mudflats where men, women and children can sift the mud to look for flecks of gold. Primitive dredging machines are also used to suck up mud from the river bottoms to be sifted for gold. Most miners earn a precarious living working long hours in dangerous and unhealthy conditions.

The game was also scheduled for release on Windows Phone 8 as part of a deal with Nokia that saw several EA games released exclusively on Nokia branded Windows Phones, but it was cancelled prior to release. Within the Dead Space series, the game is set after the events of original Dead Space and prior to the events of Dead Space 2 and shows how the Necromorph outbreak spread from the government to public sectors. Gameplay A necromorph attacks Vandal. Note the touchscreen specific control method whereby the player must swipe down and to the right to fight back. The gameplay is similar to that of the original Dead Space game, with most changes centering on adapting the game to play with touchscreen controls. Players slide their thumbs on either side of the screen to simulate the dual analog movement scheme of the original; movement on the left of the screen moves the character, movement on the right moves the camera. Players tilt the device to rotate the weapon's alignment. Players can move and explore freely, interact with objects, collect items and currency, and buy upgrades in much the same fashion as the original game. To reload, the player taps the weapon, and contextual swipes upwards or downwards are occasionally necessary. To fire, the player taps the screen to aim, and taps the screen again to shoot. The Xperia Play version has slightly different controls insofar as it utilizes the slide-out game pad, complete with \\"touch- pad\\" controls, with the left and right triggers used for aiming and firing respectively. Plot In Dead Space, the player controls \\"Vandal\\", a newly converted Unitologist on a mission in the mines of Titan Station, orbiting Saturn. Vandal is directed over a headset to destroy a series of power boxes, cutting off communications to certain parts of the station. After doing so, Vandal is attacked by a group of Necromorphs and forced to flee towards a tram system. On the way there, the head of Unitology, Daina Le Guin, tells Vandal that destroying the power boxes has released a Necromorph infestation onto the station and that Vandal's death, and the deaths of all the miners, will be a glorious event. Disgusted, Vandal decides to reveal the Unitologists' plans to the government. Meanwhile, the station's director Hans Tiedemann contacts Vandal and orders the restoration of all quarantine seals. After doing so, Vandal is contacted by Tyler Radikov, a Unitologist contact, who swears that Le Guin duped him too, and that he had no idea what Vandal's real mission was. Radikov promises to guide Vandal in escaping. Under the direction of Tiedemann and Radikov, Vandal sets out to lock down the doors to the Public Sector. Radikov says that in order to do so Vandal must shut off the power to the seals, as this will trigger all emergency seals to engage. Vandal does so, but discovers that Radikov has been lying, and in fact has provided instructions that result in the opening of all Public Sector doors, leaving the section without any defense against the Necromorphs. A furious Tiedemann demands that Vandal try to shut down the core of the station, as it is overheating, and is in danger of destroying the entire station. When Vandal reaches the core, it becomes apparent that a large Necromorph is \\"suffocating\\" it. Vandal defeats the creature, but falls into the core with it. A badly injured Vandal manages to crawl out of the core, at which point it is revealed that Vandal is female named Karrie Norton. She tries to radio Director Tiedemann for help, leaving an audio log relating what has happened. The game ends with Radikov telling Le Guin that the Necromorph outbreak was a success. Back at the core, a trail of blood leads off-screen, with only Vandal's helmet remaining; her fate is unknown. Reception Upon release, Dead Space received very positive reviews. The iOS version holds aggregate scores of 88 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty-two reviews, and 91.67% on GameRankings, based on six reviews. The game won \\"Best Mobile Game\\" (2011) at the Meffy Awards and \\"iPad Game of the Year\\" (2011) at the App Store Rewind. Reviews emphasized the extent to which the title replicated the look and feel of the Dead Space series within the limitations of a mobile touchscreen device, whilst also praising the fact that the game was a new story, not simply a port of the original Dead Space game. AppSpy's Andrew Nesvadba was extremely impressed, scoring it 5 out of 5 and writing, \\"Dead Space is a chilling experience that goes well beyond the normal expectations for mobile gaming.\\" TouchArcade's Brad Nicholson also scored it 5 out of 5. He was critical of the controls and the combat system, but concluded that \\"Dead Space is worth a download based on its production values alone. The team has successfully created a very, very dark title bolstered by a rich atmosphere that oozes everything you want out of a solid horror game.\\" TouchGen's Matt Dunn also scored it 5 out of 5. He was slightly critical of the controls, but commented that \\"literally the only negative aspect of the game involves some control inaccuracy.\\" He praised the sound design and graphics and concluded that \\"Dead Space is the best action game I've ever played on an iOS device. It's the first time I've felt like a mobile version of a game has had as much developer love put into it as its console counterpart. We've seen decent ports, and good mobile counterparts to console games, but never a game that looks and feels this close to the original [...] This isn't a cash grab or a cheap port, this is a brand new Dead Space experience.\\" Blake Grundman of 148Apps was equally impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out of 5, and writing \\"it is staggering to imagine that such a huge experience could be contained within the constraints of the iPhone, but not only does it succeed, it sets a benchmark that could be nigh impossible to match any time soon,\\" and referring to the control scheme as \\"shockingly well constructed.\\" He concluded, \\"To say that Dead Space is one of the best games that we have seen in 2011 doesn't do it justice. This is one of the most immersive experiences available on the platform. You owe it to yourself to discover that an iOS game can in fact make you shudder in fear and want to jump out of your skin. It isn't merely a game, it is an experience that all iOS gamers should partake in.\\" IGN's Levi Buchanan, scoring the game 8.5 out of 10, made a similar point; \\"Dead Space is not a cop-out, shoehorned experience ‚Äì it's a real-deal chapter in the Dead Space franchise that fits right in with the console games even though it takes a slightly different tack by de-emphasizing shock-jumps and laying on action scene after action scene. But that just means EA understands the differences (and, yes, limitations) of the iDevices. Dead Space has good controls, great visuals, and a fun story. It may repeat itself a little too much, but the blood-soaked ride never feels bloated.\\" Destructoid's Jim Sterling scored the game 8 out of 10. Although he was somewhat critical of the controls, he was impressed with how genuine a Dead Space experience the game offered; \\"Dead Space for the iDevices is no mere cash-in. Rather than go the easy route with an on-rails shooter or a selection of banal minigames, Electronic Arts and IronMonkey Studios have instead opted to cram a genuine third-person Dead Space experience into your iPhone. The weird thing is it more or less works [...] it really is impressive just how authentic a Dead Space experience has been crafted, and the generally high caliber of the game could at least justify an XBLA/PSN port.\\" Eurogamer's Kritan Reed also scored the game 8 out of 10, writing \\"This all-new Dead Space is surprisingly faithful to the full-fat versions in every sense. Before you recoil in horror at the thought of another borked touch-screen attempt at twin-stick action-adventuring, Dead Space is far more entertaining than it has any right to be. It not only captures the intricate, moody visual signature of Visceral's originals with stunning efficiency, but manages to faithfully translate the gameplay.\\" Pocket Gamer's Tracy Erickson also scored it 8 out of 10, giving it a \\"Silver Award\\". He was critical of the controls but concluded that \\"its presentation, well-constructed levels, and tense combat situations are enough to see you through, even if the controls won't.\\" Notes References Category:2011 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:BlackBerry games Category:Dead Space games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:IOS games Category:Single-player video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video games developed in Australia ","title":"Dead Space (mobile game)"},{"id":"34360858","text":"Mankivka () is an urban-type settlement located in Cherkasy Oblast (province) in central Ukraine.

It is distributed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. ProcessWire is built around an API with usage and naming conventions similar to the JavaScript framework jQuery. The stated goal behind the API is to provide the level of accessibility and control to pages in a website that jQuery provides to the DOM. Content is managed either via the API or the web- based admin control panel. ProcessWire is largely used for development of web sites, web applications, services, content feeds and related applications. Features * jQuery-styled API with comprehensive documentation * Graphical web-based installer * All fields are custom fields, indexed for find operations in the API * Can be bootstrapped from other PHP applications or command-line scripts * Interactive and API-based image manipulation functions * Drag-and-drop tree-based page list * Drag-and-drop file and image uploads and editing functions * Support for larger scale (100k+ page) installations * Use of string-based selectors for API calls * Role-based access control system * Core development emphasis on security * Markup agnostic output, leaving all output to the developer * Template files are PHP-based, with no template engine used by default * Output caching of entire pages or individual parts * Multi-language support with multi-language text fields and URLs * Modular plugin architecture and available 3rd party modules * Field and input types are themselves plugin modules * Hook system enabling most core functions to be hooked and altered * Fields and groups of fields are repeatable using built-in Repeater field types * Support for rich text editing using CKEditor Audience Before and during development of a website or application, the audience for ProcessWire consists largely of web developers and web designers. Within this audience, ProcessWire is used as both a development tool and a CMS. Post-development the audience changes to individuals that manage content for web sites and applications, who typically are not web designer/developers. This audience uses ProcessWire primarily as a CMS to manage content. History ProcessWire has been in active development since 2003. From 2003 to 2007 it was developed under the name Dictator CMS. From 2007‚Äì2010 it was developed as ProcessWire 1.x. ProcessWire became an open source community project in 2010 and it is currently developed as ProcessWire 2.x and 3.x. ProcessWire has had 8 significant version releases, and more than 100 minor version releases since the first open source release. Version 3.0 released in September 2016 is the second major version release. Translations and community ProcessWire has active, global end-user and developer communities. These communities have translated ProcessWire from English into their native languages, including: Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese. The central hub of the ProcessWire communities are found in the developer support forums. Awards and publications In November 2016 ProcessWire was awarded as CMS Critic's Best Small Business CMS. In July 2016 Smashing Magazine published A Beginners Guide to ProcessWire. Since January 2016 Envato Tuts+ has published several articles and tutorials on ProcessWire. In January 2015 ProcessWire was awarded as CMS Critic's Best Free PHP CMS. In December 2014 PHP Architect published ProcessWire: Flexibility, Power, and a Generous Dose of Pure Fun. In December 2012 ProcessWire was awarded as CMS Critic's Best Free CMS. Architecture ProcessWire is built around a page content tree (as opposed to a bucket system). The URL or path of each page is always reflective of its place in the hierarchy. One uses this same path to reference the page in the API. As a result, this connection of the path to the internal tree hierarchy defines the architecture of ProcessWire. Beyond the parent-child relationship implied by a content tree, ProcessWire supports relational one-to-one and one-to-many references between pages in the tree. Template architecture Templates in ProcessWire are a content type that contains one or more custom fields representing the definition of the content type. Every page in ProcessWire is assigned to a template which then represents the type of page. A template is typically shared among multiple pages. Templates also define access control, caching and other settings shared among pages using the template. Templates optionally have an associated PHP file, referred to as the template-file. This file is executed whenever the URL for a page using the template is accessed. As a result, template-files are typically used for output purposes. The template-file is provided with several API variables, the most notable being the \`$page\` API variable, which contains all the fields and content of the current page being viewed. Template-files serve multiple contexts, depending on the application. ProcessWire's default web site profiles use template-files primarily for output of direct and dynamically generated HTML markup. Template-files may also be used as intermediate controllers between a model and a separate view. Because template-files are regular PHP files, they are able to call upon other web services or PHP applications where appropriate, without a separate parsing layer. Field architecture All fields in ProcessWire are custom fields defined by the user. A given field may be assigned to multiple templates, which in turn hold individual chunks of content for each page using that template. Every field has a type, referred to as the ‚Äúfieldtype‚Äù (1 word), a type of plugin module. ProcessWire includes several fieldtype modules including those that support text, numbers, files, images, page references, URLs, email addresses, dates and comments. Additional fieldtype modules are installed as 3rd party modules. Distribution and requirements ProcessWire's source code is hosted on GitHub and is also distributed on Softaculous, Bitnami and Composer/Packagist. ProcessWire runs in the AMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) platform used by many hosting providers and web development environments. ProcessWire requires PHP version 5.3.8 or newer, and MySQL 5.0.15 or newer.

Ince and George Loane Tucker. It starred Mary Pickford and her husband Owen Moore after they left working at the Biograph Company. This film is preserved at the Library of Congress, a rare survivor from Pickford's IMP period. It appears on the Milestone Films DVD of Pickford's 1918 feature Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley.The Dream at silentera.com Plot The film opens in a fancy restaurant where the husband and a woman who is not his wife are polishing off a bottle of wine. Cut to home, where a dejected wife sits at the dining room table waiting for her husband. She briefly nods off before rousing and checking the wall clock indicating that it's getting late. Cut back to the fancy restaurant, where the husband settles the check with a large wad of bills. The waiter obliges by helping the husband and his lady companion with their hats and coats. The other woman kicks the husbands hat out of his hand. Six hours later, the husband strides through the door awakening his wife who is still sitting by the dining room table. He rebuffs her attempt to take his hat, whereupon she points to the wall clock. She draws his attention to dinner, which still sits on the dining table. He upends a few dishes then overturns a chair before collapsing on the sofa, cigarette in hand. Upset, the wife walks off camera and the scene fades to black. In the next scene, introduced by a title card stating \\"HIS DREAM\\", the wife returns, clad in a form-fitting dress and a plumed hat. She awakens the husband by jostling his head. Talking animatedly, she downs a couple of glasses of wine from a decanter on the sideboard and tosses the wineglass on the floor. She drop-kicks a plate, lights up a cigarette, flicks the match at her husband, and blows smoke in his face. She pelts him with a pillow that has been lying on the floor, slings her coat over her arm, pulls down the curtains covering the door, and blows the husband a kiss goodbye. A well-appointed gentleman arrives at the front steps to their house a second or two before the wife steps out the front door and they leave together. Confounded by what he has just witnessed, the husband grabs his hat and coat and leaves. The wife and her gentleman caller arrive by taxi at the fancy restaurant where they are shown to the same table the husband had occupied earlier. The husband arrives hot on their heels, briefly considers confronting them, but then flees, distressed by the whole affair. He stumbles out into the street before returning home. There he rants wildly, repeatedly grasping his forehead before settling down to compose a letter which reads in part \\"You're not the woman I supposed you were.\\" Stumbling to the sideboard, he pulls out a small revolver from a drawer, points it at his abdomen, pulls the trigger, and collapses spasmodically on the sofa. In the next scene, introduced by a title card stating \\"HIS AWAKENING\\", he falls off the sofa and stands up, clutching his abdomen. His wife enters the scene, this time reclad in her modest attire, and startles him. He recounts his vivid experience, she comforts him and helps him realize it was all just a dream. While she turns her attention to preparing dessert on the dining room table, he pulls his address book from his suitcoat pocket and shreds it. Reconciled, they embrace and then settle down to eat the confection.

History The property on which the building stands was originally owned by one of the first settlers in Polk County, Conrad Dietz. with Dietz was a German farmer who settled in the area in 1847. He sold one of the lots in 1876 to the proprietors of a hardware store, Entwistle & O‚ÄôDea. The rest of the land was leased to shopkeepers and craftsmen. By 1883 there was a row of small wood-frame buildings on the property near the intersection of Fifth and Locust Streets that had the appearance of a small town Main Street. This three-story brick structure was built by a group of East Side businessmen in 1883 three blocks from the Iowa State Capitol, and it reflects its Renaissance Revival style.

Gorovets was a performer renowned for several hits, including \\"–ö–æ—Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–æ—Ç—ã\\" (meaning Beauty Queen) from Arno Babajanian, \\"–î—Ä–æ–∑–¥—ã\\" by Vladimir Shainsky, \\"–ì–æ–ª—É–±—ã–µ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞\\" (meaning Blue city) and \\"–Ø —à–∞–≥–∞—é –ø–æ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ\\" (meaning I walk around Moscow) both by Andrey Petrov, \\"I Walk around Moscow\\" became the soundtrack of a famous film that came out after release of the single. Besides Babajanian, Shainsky, and Petrov, many more composers and songwriters wrote songs for him including Yan Frenkel, Vano Muradeli, Modest Tabachnikov, Eddie Rosner and others. In 1963, Radio Yunost, the primary youth radio in the Soviet Union broadcast his 45-minute concert throughout the Soviet Union, making him famous.List of songs by Emil Gorovets In the early 1970s, the Jewish song repertoire on Soviet radio and television came under an unofficial but well-known ban. Gorovets' songs were included in the ban because of his Jewish origin. In 1972, Gorovets and his wife, the actress Margarita Polonskaya (in Russian –ú–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–∞ –ü–æ–ª–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è), his partner and assistant, applied to emigrate to Israel, where they arrived in 1973. But his work did not develop that well in Israel, particularly Yiddish and Russian culture that was Gorovets' niche. He moved to the United States upon the invitation of New York mayor Edward Koch and a 7-year offer from the \\"Arbeiter-Ring\\" (–ê—Ä–±–∞–π—Ç–µ—Ä-–†–∏–Ω–≥). Gorovets also made a point of coming back to Israel, made an all-Israel tour of 22 concerts in the span of one month before returning to the United States. He also worked as a singing teacher and gave many concerts mainly at Manhattan's best known Russian restaurant the \\"Balalaika\\" as main soloist of the venue. However it was a big step back from his star status in the Soviet Union. He also worked at a Jewish radio station, that aired three times a week. He gradually built up new audiences through self-penned new songs. He also made Russian covers of well-known Yiddish- language classics. He also promoted Yiddish (\\"Mameloshn\\" - Yiddish for \\"native language\\", literally \\"mother's tongue\\") on the radio WMNB, and on the radio –ù–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞ (\\"Hope\\"). Through the emigration of Soviet Yiddish population, he gained great popularity in Israel through pop tunes that spanned from Israel to Jewish communities in America and Western Europe, thus introducing to them the Yiddish culture from the Soviet era. Living in a high-rise complex in Manhattan's East River on the shore, he turned one of the three rooms into a studio, where he recorded a significant number of old song remakes and some new songs in many languages, even some operatic arias. In 1989, he made a comeback in Moscow, where he received goog-enough promotion and his songs were broadcast on Russian all-union radios. After the death of his wife, he dedicated a song lyric to her. Then he met Irina who had just immigrated from Moscow. She became his third wife. He spent the rest of his life releasing some records, arranging for concerts associated with Jewish performers, and even wrote songs for others. Gorovets died in 2001 in New York at the age of 79 and was buried in a cemetery in New Jersey alongside his earlier wife Margaret Polonsky.

Linnaeus described the species in 1758. He considered that it was a serpulid worm and named it Serpula arenaria, a name which in 1767 he changed to Serpula polythalamia. There was some confusion as to precisely which taxon he was describing, but S. polythalamius became the type species of the genus Serpula, a genus of polychaete worms. In 1770, Guettard introduced the name Kuphus for the genus, realising that the animal was not a worm but a mollusc.

Food drives are operated in order to stock food banks that distribute food to homeless people, soup kitchens, vulnerable seniors, orphanages, refugees, and victims of disasters. There are also food drives to help people hold feasts on Christmas and Thanksgiving. Many are organized by community organizations, nonprofits, churches, and even individuals.

Since then, analysis of tooth specimens, dated to 7.2 million years ago, has led to suggestions that Graecopithecus may have been the oldest direct ancestor of humans excluding the chimpanzee lineage, or alternatively the last common ancestor of both humans and chimpanzees, though other scientists are skeptical of these claims. The creature was nicknamed 'El Graeco' by scientists. Discovery Graecopithecus tooth (Azmaka, Bulgaria) The original Graecopithecus specimen mandible was found in 1944, \\"reportedly unearthed as the occupying German forces were building a wartime bunker\\". The mandible with a third molar that is very worn, the root of a second molar, and a fragment of a premolar is from a site called Pyrgos Vassilissis, northwest of Athens and is dated from the late Miocene. Excavation of the site is not possible (as of 1986) due to the owner having built a swimming pool on the location. Classification G. freybergi is considered to be possibly the same taxon as Ouranopithecus macedoniensis. The hominid is the least well known of those found within Europe. The Trachilos footprints discovered in Crete in 2002 and researched in 2010 may be related to Graecopithecus.http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/evolution/footprint- find-on-crete-may-push-back-date-humans-began-to-walk-upright/news- story/2e60cbd7386573dd2a45c5cc9d79297d An examination of the detailed morphology of molar teeth from two fossils of G. freybergi published in 2017 suggests that it was a homininan, sharing ancestry with Homo but not with the chimpanzees (Pan). If this classification is correct, Graecopithecus would be the oldest known representative of the human lineage after the human- chimpanzee split, in 19th-century terminology, the \\"missing link\\" between human and non-human primates. The species was found to be some two hundred thousand years older than the oldest known hominid found in Africa (not necessarily ancestral to the human lineage), Sahelanthropus tchadensis. The emergence of Homo itself is dated to close to 4 million years later than Graecopithecus, so that the appearance of Graecopithecus in Europe does not preclude the development of Homo proper in East Africa (as suggested by Homo habilis being found in Tanzania); however, the popular press reporting on the 2017 study did cast its result in terms of determining the \\"birthplace of mankind\\". Graecopithecus lived in southeast Europe 7.2 million years ago, and if the premise of the study is correct, Graecopithecus, after evolving in Europe, would have migrated back to Africa about 7 million years ago where its descendants would eventually evolve into the genus Homo. David Begun, one of the co-authors of the study, was quoted as saying that \\"[t]his dating allows us to move the human-chimpanzee split into the Mediterranean area.\\" This was set against a quote by an uninvolved anthropologist saying that \\"[i]t is possible that the human lineage originated in Europe, but very substantial fossil evidence places the origin in Africa [...] I would be hesitant about using a single character from an isolated fossil to set against the evidence from Africa.\\" It has also been proposed the Graecopithecus may not be a direct ancestor of the human lineage, but instead may have evolved its hominin-like traits independently; it is noted that, \\"not all anthropologists agree with Begun and his team's conclusions. As noted by New Scientist, it is possible that the Nikiti ape is not related to hominins at all. It may have evolved similar features independently, developing teeth to eat similar foods or chew in a similar manner as early hominins.\\" Other scientists have also expressed skepticism of Begun's classification. Bernard Wood at George Washington University described the hypothesis as \\"relatively weak\\" and Sergio Alm√©cija, also at George Washington University, says it is important to bear in mind that primates seem particularly prone to evolving similar features independently. \\"Single characters are not reliable to make big evolutionary [claims].\\" See also    *  Notes   References       * Category:Miocene primates of Europe Category:Hominin fossils Category:Prehistoric Greece ‚Ä†Graecopithecus Category:Prehistoric primate genera Category:Neogene fossil record Category:Fossil taxa described in 1972 Category:Fossils of Serbia ","title":"Graecopithecus"},{"id":"34360945","text":"Tsvitkove () is an urban-type settlement located in Horodyshche Raion (district) of Cherkasy Oblast (province) in central Ukraine.

A film adaptation was released in 1986. The song has become relevant enough that the refrain \\"joga pedra na Geni\\" has been referenced in situations where people are victims of moral patrolling.  Composition  The lyrics are hepta-syllabic rhyming verses with strict meter, and are about Geni, a prostitute who was ostracized by the townspeople. After a zeppelin approaches the town and its pilot threatens to attack it, the ship's pilot demands Geni to sleep with him so he will spare the town, which she does. The populace temporarily treat Geni differently. The day after, she returns home and is immediately persecuted just as she was before.  Inspiration  Some sources suggest Geni could have been inspired by the homonymous character from Nelson Rodrigues's 1965 play Toda Nudez Ser√° Castigada.  Meaning  Various sources believe the song to be critical of colonialism, imperialism and capitalism, and that Geni is a personification of the oppressed groups and peoples.

He was highly praised by his contemporaries for his ability and integrity, but his reputation has suffered as a result of his conduct as a judge at the trial for treason of William Orr, which is widely regarded as a grave miscarriage of justice. Personal life Chamberlain was born in Dublin, the son of Michael Chamberlain, counsellor-at-law, and his wife Deborah Roberts, an heiress who was described as \\"charming and accomplished\\". He attended St.Bees School in West Cumbria, matriculated from the University of Dublin in 1769 and took his degree of Bachelor of Arts there in 1774. He entered the Middle Temple in 1775 and was called to the Bar in 1779.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.2 p.227 Wife and children He married Lucy Boyd, eldest daughter of Higatt Boyd of Rosslare House, Rosslare Harbour, and his wife Amy Phillips, and had at least six children: *Higatt, who died in infancy, *Michael, an army officer. *William junior (died 1821). *Charles, a diplomat who spent part of his career in South America and part in Spain.

Career To advance his career Chamberlain joined the well-known political club, the Order of St. Patrick or the Screw, whose members called themselves The Monks of the Screw. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Clonmines, but though he was noted for his wit and talent, he did not have much reputation as a politician.Ball, p.181 He was appointed a justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1793 and was transferred to the Court of King's Bench the following year. He sat on the Special Commission to deal with the Rebellion of 1798. Last years His health was poor: he called himself \\"a martyr to the gout\\".Ball, p.242 He died in 1802, aged only 51. He was buried in St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street. His widow moved to England: she died at Bath in 1831. State trials As he was generally agreed to be an able and conscientious judge, it was natural that Chamberlain should play a large part in the political trials of the mid-1790s, which culminated in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. That he should be attacked by United Irishmen and nationalists generally was understandable; but one notable trial, that of William Orr, damaged his reputation even among his admirers.Ball, p.183 He sat on a commission to try cases of treason in 1795-6, but most of the accused were acquitted.Ball, p.184 At the summer assizes in Armagh in 1797, where more than 150 people were tried for sedition, Chamberlain had \\"the awful and unexampled duty\\" of sentencing 20 men to death at one sitting.Ball, p. 184 After the 1798 Rebellion he sat on the special commission to try the rebels, but the verdicts do not suggest that he displayed any great degree of severity: only five people were put on trial and only one was hanged.Ball, p.185 Another state trial, that of Patrick Finney in 1798, shows Chamberlain as a judge at his best. Finney, a Dublin tobacconist, was charged with treason, largely on the word of one James O'Brien.Speeches of John Philpot Curran New York 1811 Vol.1 p.252 He was defended by John Philpot Curran, who in one of his most famous speeches destroyed O'Brien's credit. Chamberlain conducted the trial with notable fairness: in his summing up he cast doubt on the evidence of O'Brien, and virtually directed an acquittal.Speeches of John Philpot Curran pp.276‚Äì7 The jury found Finney not guilty. Notwithstanding his conduct in the case of William Orr, there is little evidence overall that Chamberlain was a political time-server. William Orr William Orr, a popular and respected farmer from County Antrim, was charged with administering the United Irishman oath to a soldier called Hugh Wheately: this had recently been made a capital offence, and, in a departure from the normal rules of evidence, only one witness was required to swear to the commission of the offence. Orr was tried at the summer assizes in 1797 before Lord Avonmore, the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and Chamberlain.Ball, p. 183 John Philpot Curran, defending, exposed Wheately as a liar and man of bad character and argued that the jury had no choice but to acquit. His argument that the judges had misstated the law led to angry exchanges between counsel and the Bench. The circumstances which led to the guilty verdict later caused much comment, two of the jury claiming that they had been made drunk, and two others claiming that they had been threatened. It may be that the judges themselves had doubts about Orr's guilt as Avonmore is said to have shed tears as he pronounced the death sentence. Despite numerous pleas for a reprieve, Orr was hanged at Carrickfergus on 14 October. Wheatley, the crucial witness against him, died soon afterwards, probably by his own hand. Shortly before his death he is said to have confessed that he had perjured himself at Orr's trial. As it is generally accepted now that Orr was innocent,Ball, p.183 Chamberlain clearly shares the responsibility for the miscarriage of justice; however, Avonmore was very much the senior judge and seems to have dominated the proceedings. The Government, aware of the hostile public reaction, praised both judges for \\"integrity and humanity\\". On the other hand, a Dublin newspaper, The Press, was sufficiently concerned by the trial to attack the conduct of both judges, and the editor, Peter Finnerty was prosecuted and convicted for seditious libel as a result.Ball, p.183 Character Chamberlain was praised as an able and upright judge and a sound lawyer; even his conduct of the Orr trial had its defenders.Ball, p.183 When he died in 1802, the newly appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Lord Redesdale, was warned that it would not be easy to find a suitable replacement.Ball, p.242 He had a great gift for friendship: his colleague, later Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Lord Downes, when he died in 1826 asked to be buried in St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street, beside Chamberlain, his inseparable friend for many years: \\"their union and friendship was complete....and now they lie together in the same tomb\\". Like most judges of the time he was notably extravagant: judges were expected to live and entertain on a scale beyond their salaries, and Chamberlain, who had a wife and six children to support, is said to have died almost penniless.Ball, p.250 References Category:1751 births Category:1802 deaths Category:Lawyers from Dublin (city) Category:Irish MPs 1790‚Äì1797 Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Members of the Middle Temple Category:Justices of the Irish Common Pleas Category:Justices of the Irish King's Bench Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Wexford constituencies ","title":"William Tankerville Chamberlain"},{"id":"34361244","text":"William Francis Bailey (June 20, 1842 ‚Äì April 5, 1915) was a politician and jurist in Wisconsin.

Life Of Armenian descent, Agemian was originally from Bursa, Turkey, and graduated from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia with a Gold Medal Award from the Associazione Artistica in 1926. During the Armenian Genocide, Agemian witnessed his father get killed. He was then separated from his family and sent to Venice for study. Up to 1931, he worked and taught in Italy and from 1931 to 1938 in Paris. Agemian was a representative of the school of academic realism and a skillful master of composition. He has painted national themes reflecting the ancient as well as the contemporary history of the Armenian people, frequently inspired by the distinct decorative-allegorical paintings of the Italian Renaissance. Agemian was also a portraitist and a landscapist. He has painted murals with spiritual as well as secular themes. They can be found in Armenian Catholic and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches in France, Italy, Turkey, and in America in New York City, Belmont, and Indian Orchard, Massachusetts. In addition to those works, there are paintings in the Mekhitarist College in Venice, the Monastery on the Island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni and also several homes of friends in the United States. Career in art His artistic career started in France. During the period 1931 to 1938, his paintings were widely exhibited in Paris, Vienna, Venice, and Milan. He was primarily concerned with religious art and profane subjects. He began to paint prolifically after resigning as art professor at the College Moorat in S√®vres, France. Agemian's mural technique reflected the influence of Old Masters such as Titian. As time went on, he showed himself to be versatile, equally at home with small compositions as well as monumental murals. Subjects included portraits, still life, landscapes, nudes, figures and battle scenes. His portraits were of dignitaries from the political, religious, and entertainment world. They included Giovanni Martinelli, Akim Tamiroff's wife, Louis Martin, Minister of the French Navy, Pope Pius XI, and Cardinal Gr√©goire-Pierre Agagianian. He is most well known for the \\"Face of Christ\\" painted in 1935 and based on the negative of the Shroud of Turin. Agemian, who was a religious man, was still nourishing the seed of a priestly vocation. He also wanted to spend some time in America and study the American people for a series of tableaux on democracy. Thus his decision to spend several months in the United States. This move in 1938 signaled the start of a new era for the young artist. An art exhibit in 1939 in New York was described as one of the most extraordinary assemblages to be seen on art gallery row in a long time. Critics proclaimed that ‚Äúthe artist reveals a diversifying talent with the ability to deal with formal organization; a nice color sense; and a generally romantic approach‚Äù and that he was \\"obviously trained in European traditions of sound craftsmanship\\". Shortly after Ariel Agemian arrived in America, he set up a studio in New York City where he taught art to now famous artists, Erik Schmidt and Richard Mantia while he continued to paint. He perfected the use of pastels on construction and working with the dark to light concept with the Chiaroscuro effect. On black construction he used white chalk and brought life from the black background. Ariel married Maria Roxas in June, 1939. They had a son, Stefan, and a daughter, Annig. In 1943 Agemian became an American citizen and began to work for Msgr. Joseph F. Stedman and then Msgr. Frey who were directors of the Confraternity of the Precious Blood, a publishing house for Catholic literature in Brooklyn, New York. Agemian painted over 500 illustrations. They are in the books, My Daily Psalms, Christ in the Gospel, The Imitation of Christ, My Meditation on the Gospel and My Mass. His reproduction of Christ, from the Shroud of Turin, is considered the most exact by experts in the scientific research field. After coming to America, the artist's technique and subject matter noticeably changed to purely religious. Only a few portraits of dear friends were painted during the next twenty years. He sketched daily, lived somewhat the life of a recluse and his works were not displayed publicly again after 1939. In 1958, Ariel Agemian was given the highest honor bestowed upon a layman by the Catholic Church. He was awarded a Gold Medal from Pope Pius XII and knighted into the Order of Saint Gregory the Great. On March 10, 2012, Ariel Agemian was posthumously awarded a distinguished alumni honor as an artist given by the Mekhatarian Alumni Association in Toronto, Canada. Legacy His legacy lives on in his works. There have been several showings in the Grand Junction and Glenwood Springs area in Colorado. Some religious works have been donated to museums in New York City, Holy Cross Armenian Catholic Church in Belmont, MA; St. Mark's in Wynnewood, PA; St. Bernard's Church in New Broomfield, PA; Collegio Armeno in Rome; and Yerevan, Armenia. In 2011, the painting Christ in the Temple, dedicated to the \\"Son of God coming into the Temple\\" feast in the Armenian Apostolic Church and Eastern Catholic Church, was donated to Anna Maria College in Paxton, Massachusetts, also his daughter's alma mater. The majority of works done in America have been in the private collection of Howard and Annig Agemian Raley in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. The latest exhibition was in January 2014 at the new Glenwood Springs Library in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Just recently another of Agemian's portraits have been located in Ruben Sevak Museum, an art museum located in Vagharshapat, Armenia. Opened on 10 September 2013.

Cave & Sons is a London-based leather luxury goods company founded in 1839 and regarded by some as the inventor of the luxury leather handbag. History The Original Company was established in 1839 as a sole trader, the company is famous for making the Osilite trunk, a strong and light trunk used on the 1933 Everest Expedition and several other adventures. The case won several major prizes in the 19th Century including first prize in Paris in 1867, beating rivals Asprey. The trunk was popular as an early flight case. It is also thought that they could have been earliest pioneers of the modern purse or handbag. it is known that Samuel Parkinson; an industrialist, purchased a handbag in the mid to late 1800s, made of the same leather as the luggage for his wife to use on the train. This is the first record of a designer handbag or purse as in modern use. It is known that Cave inspired both Louis Vuitton (1857) and a young Guccio Gucci (circa 1910). Gucci, as an immigrant in London, was impressed with the luxurious luggage he saw hotel guests brought with them and Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite trunk could be easily stacked. The H.J. Cave's tote was large enough to hold a baby, thus conferring one of theatre's all-time classic lines on Lady Bracknell in The Importance of Being Earnest. The company held a British Royal Warrant of appointment until the 1940s and counts among its customers Ruth Vincent, T. E.

It is classified as part of the Mosasaurini tribe (within the Mosasaurinae) and is exclusively known from the Maastrichtian phosphates of the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. Eremiasaurus means \\"desert lizard\\", referring to the arid climate of present-day Morocco where its fossils were recovered. One species is known, E. heterodontus, whose specific name refers to high degree of heterodonty exhibited compared to other species of mosasaur.  Description  Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, Paris|220x220px Eremiasaurus is known from two specimens, both designated as syntype specimens. The syntype specimen UALVP 51744 consists of a nearly complete skull, vertebral column and isolated pieces of the appendicular skeleton, whilst the syntype specimen OCP DEK/GE 112 also includes a nearly complete skull as well as a nearly complete vertebral column. Based on observations of these specimens, several distinguishing features can be established that clearly support Eremiasaurus as a distinct genus. The most prominent of these is the high degree of heterodonty and the unusually large number of pygal vertebrae, only Plotosaurus is known to have possessed more pygal vertebrae. \\"Liodon\\" mosasauroides Gaudry, 1892 is apparently a species of Eremiasaurus based on unpublished morphological comparisons reported in an SVP abstract by Mohr et al. (2019).Mohr, LeBlanc, Caldwell, 2019. REDESCRIPTION AND REASSIGNMENT OF ‚ÄúLIODON‚Äù MOSASAUROIDES TO THE GENUS EREMIASAURUS (SQUAMATA, MOSASAURIDAE). SVP 2019, Annual Meeting, Program and Abstracts, 79A: 155.  Classification  An analysis carried out at the time of its description featuring a data matrix of 135 characters and 32 terminal taxa recovered Eremiasaurus heterodontus as a sister taxon to the Plotosaurini, a tribe now seen as synonymous with the Mosasaurini. A close relation to (or even inclusion within) the Mosasaurini is supported by the presence of an internarial bar keel, the exclusion of the prefrontals from the narial borders, narial embayments in the frontal and the presence of a quadrate ala groove. Eremiasaurus differs from the closely related Mosasaurus and Plotosaurus in having the infrastapedial and suprastapedial processes of the quadrate fused, possessing a very large and rounded stapedial pit, large pterygoid teeth and the glenoid condyle of the humerus being gently domed.

The album was recorded during the 2011 Popes of Pendarvia World Tour to promote the album The King Is Dead at venues across the United States. The album was released as a double Compact Disc and a triple vinyl LP set. The title comes from a line in the track \\"The Infanta\\", from the album Picaresque. Reception The album received a largely positive reception from critics and holds a 77 at Metacritic with 13 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Drowned in Sound's David Edwards has called the album \\"remarkably feisty live record which manages to capture the carnival of their live show with admirable aplomb\\" noting that The Decemberists are a \\"band best appreciated live\\" who embrace vaudeville-type skits and audience participation. Writing for Consequence of Sound, Jake Cohen agrees that the spontaneous banter and theatrics of the album are a strength, but both reviewers lament a lack of visuals to accompany the recording. In a positive review, PopMatters editor Zachary Houle called the album \\"a sterling document of a band at the peak of their powers showcasing just how good they really are\\" also praising the between-track banter. Andy Gill of The Independent calls the album a mix of \\"intelligence and drive\\" and gave it four out of five stars, comparing the anthemic content to Arcade Fire and R.E.M. A mixed review came from Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media. Granting that the band's \\"heady concepts, genre nods, and oddball experiments... gel fairly well\\", he still found the onstage antics of the band \\"too precocious, too juvenile\\" and opines that a DVD of their performance would only enhance the silliness of their live performance. Pastes Doug Heselgrave called the album \\"respectable\\", noting that the musicians were talented, but the mix was too focused on percussion and the performances don't add much to the previously- released studio versions of these songs. Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club disagreed with the sentiment, calling the songs \\"different enough\\" and compares the engaging performances with a heavy metal band.

The genus etymology comes from Bawiti, the principal settlement of the Bahariya Oasis in Egypt. It is known from several ectopterygoid bones and some sparse scales. Morphology Compared to modern polypterids, Bawitius was enormous: the Bawitius holotype ectopterygoid is five times larger than the one of Polypterus and the scales are unusually large, too: these remains suggest the living animal may have been up to 300 centimeters (9.8 feet) in length. The morphology of Bawitius is different enough to justify its assignment to a new genus. Unique features of the genus are, for example, an anterioposteriorly elongated contact between the lateral process and the maxilla, a high, narrow ectopterygoid and the presence of 14 teeth in the main tooth row. The scales are different, too, apart from size, from those of modern polypterids: they feature a discontinuous ganoine layer, a rectilinear shape, and small articular processes. Ecological relevance The existence of drastically different polypterids such as Bawitius and Serenoichthys corroborates the existence of a variety of polypterid fishes in the ecosystems of Late Cretaceous of North Africa.

At the right, the museum The Stirling Pavilion of the museum allow the public to better understand the evolution of the Stirling House as an Anglican mission, as well as the region. The Stirling House is a prefab structure, planned and made of cast iron by the Iron Works of Mr. Hemming & Co., Old Ford, in 1869 for ¬£265,00. on behalf of the South American Mission Society (SAMS). The overall size of the house was . The house had cellar (bricks), a firm roof with steel trusses, and walls covered with sheets of zinc. It was the first building erected by Europeans in Tierra del Fuego and was named for the missionary Waite Stirling, who had set up a mission at Ushuaia, living in a hut. Towards the end of 1870 the house arrived (unassembled) in Port Stanley. It was transported to and built in Ushuaia in 1871. It was used as a residence by the missionaries Thomas Bridges and James Lewis and their families. To extend their influence over the outer islands by a more central location, SAMS moved the house to the Baily Island in 1888. Leonard Burgleigh and his wife lived there as missionaries. In 1894 the house was reinstalled at Tekenika Bay, on the southeast coast of Hoste Island. The missionaries were trying to set up a center in a location away from the abuses and crimes caused by the recent arrival of miners in Ushuaia. The Yahgan continued to suffer high fatalities due to infectious disease. The land was poor and they were being encroached on by gold diggers. In 1907 the mission decided to move to the Douglas Bay area on the Navarino Island. The station in Ushuaia was closed and the remaining materials were sent to Douglas Bay. It became the center of all missionary work in the region. After the mission in Douglas Bay was finally closed in 1916, the house was used by a variety of residents. In 2003 Casa Stirling was declared a Chilean National Monument.Casa Stirling , Monumentoes, Chile, retrieved on 27 August 2013 In 2004 it was moved by sea from Douglas Bay (at the Murray Channel) to Puerto Williams on the lands of the anthropological museum.
