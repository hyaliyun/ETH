This site is located at a distance of 41 km east from English Bazar town. The most significant findings from this site include a copper-plate inscription of Pala emperor Mahendrapaladeva and the structural remains of a 9th-century Buddhist Vihara: Nandadirghika-Udranga Mahavihara. The importance of this site was first indicated by the chance discovery of a copper plate inscription of the Pala emperor Mahendrapala on 13 March 1987 who was not known from any other sources till the date of this discovery. Later, the excavation by a team of the Directorate of Archaeology & Museums, West Bengal Government led by Sudhin De began in 1992 at Tulabhita mound, followed by an extensive excavation at the same site in 1995-96 under the direction of Amal Ray of the same directorate.Chakrabarti, D. K. (2001). Archaeological Geography of the Ganga Plain: the Lower and the Middle Ganga, New Delhi: Permanent Black, , pp. 75-6 The excavations resulted in discovery of a part of the brick built Vihara, stupas, cells with corbelled niches, verandah and many antiquities, which include terracotta plaques, terracotta seals and sealings, an inscribed potsherd, beads and other objects for daily use. Site The site comprises a number of mounds, most impressive of them is the 5 m high Tulabhita or Salaidanga. other significant mounds are: Akhridanga, Nimdanga, Rajar Mayer Dhipi and Nandagarh. Another significant feature of the site is a large tank, Nandadighi (Nandadirghika of Maehndrapala's inscription) which still covers a large area. Tulabhita mound covers an area of 9432 m¬≤. Total 262 trenches ( 6 m x 6 m) were laid, of which 78 trenches have been excavated so far. Excavations and findings The excavation has revealed six distinct layers of deposit, of which second to fourth are the most significant in terms of activities. Two phases of construction work can be identified. The first phase was probably abandoned due to the flood, the second period of construction started over it without any substantial chronological gap. The excavation at the central part of the Tulabhita mound has revealed the eastern part of a burnt brick-built Vihara. A number of sizes of bricks (32 cm x 18 cm x 6 cm, 28 cm x 26 cm x 5 cm, 23 cm x 17 cm x 8 cm, 28 cm x 15 cm x 6 cm and 17 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm) and mud morter were used to construct the 1 m wide wall of the Vihara. The northeast and the southwest corners of the Vihara have been exposed. The exposed 1.7 m wide inner courtyard of the Vihara is made of rammed bricks with a tiled pathway. The post-holes have been traced along the pathway at a regular distance of 2.5 m. It probably indicates the existence of a shed over the pathway for circumambulation during the rainy season. A 3 m wide staircase with three steps at the eastern part of the courtyard attached to the verandah has been exposed. A brick stupa, having a circumference of 6 m and diameter of 2.25 m has also been identified. A part of the eastern verandah with rammed-floor of the Vihara has also been found. The excavation at the southeast corner of the Tulabhita mound has exposed two monastic cells of 2.6 m x 2.6 m dimension with corbelled 1.05 m high niches on the southern wall of each cell. The height of the cells is 3 m. from the floor level. Originally an opening of 130 m x 1.28 m was provided on the partition wall between the cells, which was blocked later. Four distinct layers of deposit were excavated to reach the floor level of these cells. A huge brick-built stupta along with a wall adjacent to its southern part has been exposed at the northwestern corner of the mound. Most probably this stupta is hollow inside. The excavation, which was carried out up to the depth of 1.5 m has exposed a niche on the southern side with a blocked opening indicative of the activities during the second phase. A few fragmentary gray colored potsherds were discovered at the core of the stupa. The extant height of this stupa is about 3.5 m and its circumference is 19.63 m. Artifacts A significant number of artifacts were found from the site, which include the copper plate inscription of Mahendrapala (presently preserved in the Malda Museum), a 175 cm high bronze image of Marichi, more than a hundred terracotta seals and sealings, many terracotta plaques and decorated bricks. Before the commencement of the excavations, a small bronze seated image of Buddha in bhumisparshamudra (earth-touching gesture) was found from a local resident. Most of this artifacts are preserved at present in the Jagjivanpur gallery of the State Archaeological Museum at Behala, Kolkata along with a scaled model of the site. The copper plate inscription of Mahendrapala The copper plate is inscribed on the both sides (40 lines on the obverse and 32 lines on the reverse) in Siddhamatrika script prevalent in the 9th century in Sanskrit language. A royal seal is attached to the top of the plate, which comprises within a lotus, a dharmachakra at the centre, flanked by deers on either side and the legend Shri Mahendrapaladeva below. The weight of the copper plate is 11.85 kg and it measures 52 cm x 37.5 cm. The copper plate was issued by the emperor Mahendrapala on the 2nd day of Vaisakha month of his seventh regnal year (854) from Kuddalakhataka jayaskandhavara (camp of victory) in the Pundravardhana bhukti. It states that the emperor Mahendrapala, the son and successor of Devapala, announced before the body of the officers and other persons assembled on the occasion of a land grant ceremony that his mahasenapati (general) Vajradeva had intended to donate the land adjacent to the Nandadirghika Udranga Mahavihara, erected by him for attainment of religious merits for his parents and all people on earth for the worship of the Buddhist deities and maintenance and performance of religious rites which include copying (manuscripts) by the monks residing in the Vihara. The terracotta seals The terracotta seals found from the site are circular in shape and inscribed with legends, varying from one to three lines. Most of these seals and sealings are monastic, though some of these are personal and votive in nature. Most notable discovery was a monastic seal depicting the dharmachakra and deer motif, which bears the name of the Vihara in two lines. Inscribed in Siddhamatrika script in Sanskrit language, the seal reads (as read by Debala Mitra): Shri Vajradeva Karita Nanda Dirghi Vihariya Arya Bhikshu Sam(ghasya) (of the venerable community of monks residing in the Nanda Dirghi Vihara which was caused to be built by Shri Vajradeva). The terracotta plaques More than 250 terracotta plaques have been discovered during the excavations from the collapsed debris of the stupa complex at the northwestern corner of the mound. Made of fine, levigated clay, often with a micaceous compound, the plaques are normally red in colour and rectangular in shape. These plaques were probably used to decorate the outer surface of the stupa as at Paharpur and Mainamati. The plaques are of different sizes, the most common size is 28 cm x 24 cm x 7 cm. Some of these are intact and in good state of preservation. These plaques depict Shiva, Surya, Avalokiteshvara, Vidyadharas, Gandharvas, Garuda, Kinnaras and Kinnaris, warriors, man with parasol, a devotee, boar, lion, deer, peacock and swan. A unique plaque depicts a sacred manuscript (most probably the prajnaparamita) on a lotus and a kneeling devotee. The decorated bricks and other artifacts A number of decorated tiled-bricks have been found from the site of sizes 28 cm x 23 cm x 8 cm, 32 cm x 24 cm x 6 cm and 33.5 cm x 23 cm x 6 cm. These bricks depict various motifs like scroll motif, lotus petal motif and diamond shaped chain motif. Some of these also depict mat design and geometrical shapes. The excavations also yielded beads of semi-precious stones of varying sizes, terracotta lamps, bangles of iron and terracotta, a small terracotta elephant, and many red and gray potshreds.

Refuge facts  The San Bernardino Valley once supported permanently flowing creeks, springs, and marshy wetlands.

While the extensive wetlands here once provided historic habitat for eight different kinds of native fish, the lowering water table led to severe changes in the habitat and the eventual local extinctions of many species. The San Bernandino National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1982 as part of a novel approach of rescuing these species; manmade artesian wells connected to the aquifer that could host the endangered fish being threatened by the draining of their habitats.  Ecology  The refuge protects several endangered species of fish endemic to the Yaqui River's watershed that reach their northernmost limits at the refuge. As the Yaqui River primarily flows through Mexico, the refuge is also the only area in the United States where these fish are found. The fish include the Yaqui chub (Gila purpurea), beautiful shiner (Cyprinella formosa), Yaqui catfish (Ictalurus pricei), Yaqui topminnow (Poeciliopsis sonoriensis), Yaqui longfin dace (Agosia chrysogaster sp 1), and Mexican stoneroller (Campostoma ornatum). The former four species are considered federally endangered within the United States and are protected by the Endangered Species Act. Other rare, range-limited species known from the refuge include the Cochise pincushion cactus (Escobaria robbinsiorum) Huachuca water umbel (Lilaeopsis schaffneriana), San Bernandino springsnail (Pyrgulopsis bernandina), and Chiricahua leopard frog (Lithobates chiricahuensis). Threats San Bernardino is close to the Trump wall, and since the wall cuts through a migration corridor for the jaguar between Mexico and the US, it will likely stop the migration of Mexican jaguars to the US, besides other animals. From late 2019 onwards, massive amounts of water have been pumped from the aquifer for the wall's construction, causing likely permanent damage to the natural water flow in the area. Declassified emails released in mid 2020, dating back to the beginning of the wall's construction in fall 2019, found that water extraction for the wall drained several of the refuge's crucial artesian wells, forcing evacuations of the endangered fish in them. Large- capacity water pumps had to be purchased and installed in order to mimic the natural pond outflow lost by the water extraction. Refuge manager Bill Radke has referred to the wall's construction as the ‚Äúcurrent greatest threat to endangered species in the southwest region‚Äù.

During that time, he played for the Muncie Flyers, Chicago Staleys and the Dayton Triangles. He was a member of the Staleys' 1921 Championship team. The Staleys were renamed the Chicago Bears in 1922. Ken also played with the independent Fort Wayne Friars in 1920, alongside the legendary Jim Thorpe. Prior to playing football professionally, Ken played college football at Purdue University. He was a three-time letterman with the Boilermakers in 1916, 1917 and 1919. Rough first game Ken also played in one of the first NFL games as Muncie played the Rock Island Independents on October 3, 1920. While serving as the team's punter, Huffine had three of his punts blocked during the game. The Independents used each blocked punt to score three touchdowns in the first quarter. Rock Island's Ed Shaw blocked Huffine's first attempt and Arnie Wyman picked it up to run 35 yards for the score. Later Huffine got off a successful punt, however the Islanders drove to the Muncie two-yard line, only to fumble. But, when Huffine went into the end zone for yet another punt attempt, Walt Buland broke through to block, and Wyman scored again by falling on the ball in the end zone. As soon as Huffine was called upon to punt again, Shaw and Oke Smith blocked another one. This time Dewey Lyle recovered but stepped out of bounds on the 15-yard line. Rube Ursella then scored for Rock Island shortly after. Personality and traits According to Henry E. Beck's book Growin' Up With Men And Machines, Ken is described as a \\"soft spoken man with a hand like a catcher's mitt\\". He was an educated person as people like being around him.

It has a metallic green body and at rest it holds its wings away from its body. Its common name in English is the eastern willow spreadwing. Taxonomy The genus Chalcolestes is separated from Lestes because of differences in their larvae. C. parvidens is closely related to C. viridis and used to be considered a subspecies of C. viridis, however there are small morphological differences between the two species both as adults and larvae and analysis of proteins from the two species, by electrophoresis, also supports their separation into two species, but they are hard to tell apart in the field. Distribution and habitat C. parvidens is found in eastern and central Europe, in Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Turkey. It is found on islands in the eastern Mediterranean; on Cyprus, Corsica, Crete and Sicily. In Italy and the Balkans both C. parvidens and C. viridis occur together. It is only in the last 20 years that odonaterists have been separating C. parvidens from C. viridis so some of the older records for C. viridis will probably be for C. parvidens. Identification In the field it is not possible to reliably distinguish C. viridis from C. parvidens. Both species are mainly metallic green, like the Lestes damselflies, but larger and darker but they do not have a powder blue pruinescence which is common in Lestes. The pterostigma is pale brown and outlined in black. The thorax has thin yellow antehumerals and broader yellow stripe above a thin black line on each side; the upper edge of the stripe is irregular. Both C. viridis and C. parvidens have a prominent spur-like marking on the side of the thorax. Behaviour Flight period is from May to November. Behaviour is similar to that described in C. viridis. Mature males defend vertical territories in marginal shrubs and small trees where they find and mate with females in the normal damselfly manner forming the wheel position. Egg laying occurs with the pair in tandem, the eggs being laid into incisions in the bark of overhanging branches, not into submerged vegetation as is the case in many damselflies. Egg laying can result in distinct oval galls forming in the shrub's bark. The eggs develop rapidly for a few weeks and then enter a diapause state. In this state the eggs development is very slow and it is in this state that the eggs overwinter. The following spring the eggs hatch, the larvae drop into the water and start to develop. Growth is rapid and adults can emerge in a couple of months. After emerging the adults move away from water to mature. In this stage of their life-cycle which in C. parvidens is quite long, the immature adults cannot breed. The adults need a period of time for their reproductive organs to develop and this non-breeding period also stops the adults breeding too early in the season. If the females lay eggs early in the year the eggs will develop when it is to warm to for them to enter diapause. They might hatch out before winter and the resultant larva will die when winter temperatures occur. When fully mature the adults return to water and start breeding.

It focuses on the rivalry between Sir Clive Sinclair (played by Alexander Armstrong), who developed the ZX Spectrum, and Chris Curry (played by Martin Freeman), the man behind the BBC Micro.  Plot  The drama is centred on two of the leading players and their respective companies in the home computer market of the late 1970s and early 1980s focusing on the race to win a grant from the BBC to become the provider of a home computer for the BBC's programming for schools. Certain parts of the drama are based on historical fact while others are dramatisation and a version of events at the time. The main characters are ZX Spectrum creator Clive Sinclair and BBC Micro creators Chris Curry, Sophie Wilson, Steve Furber and Hermann Hauser. (The real-life Wilson also makes a brief cameo as a barmaid.)  Cast  * Alexander Armstrong as Clive Sinclair * Martin Freeman as Chris Curry * Edward Baker-Duly as Hermann Hauser * Sam Phillips as Steve Furber * Derek Riddell as Nigel Searle * Colin Michael Carmichael as Jim Westwood Cameo * Chris Serle and Ian McNaught-Davis also appear through the incorporation of stock footage from The Computer Programme. *Sophie Wilson plays a pub landlady while the younger Wilson is played by Stefan Butler.  Production   Development  The programme was created by independent production company Darlow Smithson and was written by Tony Saint, directed by Saul Metzstein and produced by Andrea Cornwell. It was produced as a BBC Drama, shot in the UK, with some scenes shot in and around the colleges of Cambridge on 15 July 2009. Computers were supplied by The Centre for Computing History, then in Haverhill. They also supplied other technical props, including the , and Jason Fitzpatrick, director of the museum, played the part of David Johnson-Davies. The programme's working title was Syntax Era.

Return to the Black Country At eighteen he returned to his family's large house in Tettenhall, The Woodhouse. He joined his father's manufacturing firm, but at twenty-seven he had left to pursue his artistic ambitions. He painted works inspired by scenes from both his father's iron foundry and the steel works of Sir Alfred Hickman, 1st Baronet, who was a friend of his father's. Work Edwin was originally self-taught, he seems to have no formal art training except for learning basic techniques by his friend and fellow artist, Joseph Vickers de Ville.

It also provides invaluable habitat for 250 species of migrant and wintering birds and contains archaeological sites representing the remains of human occupation from 13,000 years ago. In addition to protecting the San Pedro River's rare ecosystem for future generations, the BLM also works to stabilize and preserve several historic buildings and structures located throughout much of the San Pedro Riparian NCA, including those of the Fairbank Historic Townsite, the Little Boquillas Ranch and the San Pedro House.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Ca√ßarelhos e Angueira. The population in 2011 was 116,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 22.18 km¬≤.Eurostat It is situated near the north- west corner of the district of Bragan√ßa. History Until 1853, Angueira was part of the extinct municipality of Outeiro. This early history is marked by a community of several chapels, the one to S√£o Miguel, as legend suggests, was founded by a former general, who turned hermit (and was later buried at the door of the temple). Geography The river Angueira crossing the causeway between either margin Angueira is located near the Portuguese frontier with Spain, in the northwest corner of the municipality of Vimioso, bordered in the north by the parishes of Avelanoso, west by Vale de Frades, south by Ca√ßarelhos, and east by the municipality of Miranda do Douro. The parish is connected with its neighbours by main roads that intersect in the village, and link it to S√£o Joanico, Ca√ßarelhos, Avelanoso and Spain, by the asphalted Tr√™s Marras roadway. Crossed by the river of the same name, the main settlement of Angueira is located in the centre of this parish, occupying a small portion in pasturelands and forests, on the right margin of the Angueira River, in a shallow valley. The river is Angueira's ex-libris central attraction, a meandering course that bisects the parish, yet attracts locals and tourists throughout the year. Economy A rural community, the residents are primarily involved in agricultural activities (supporting the raising of cattle, sheep and goats, owing to the rich pasturelands), although commercial businesses are located in the centre. Included in these activities is apiculture, fishing (mainly threadfin) and civil construction, in addition to hunting. The local Associa√ß√£o de Ca√ßadores () has promoted hunting in this region; known for its natural ecosystem that supports rabbit, partridge and quail, the Association, has in the past helped stock species for game hunting. At one time the waters of the Angueira River were popular destinations for fisherman hoping to catch abundant langoustine, principally from Spain. Architecture Civic * Fountain of Pio () Religious * Chapel of Santo Cristo () * Chapel of S√£o Sebasti√£o () * Chapel of S√£o Miguel () * Church of S√£o Cipriano () In addition to the religious architecture, Angueira still preserves examples of the castro culture, which at one time supported the Moors, or pre-dates their period. In addition, springs, such as the Fonte Santa, known for local healing properties or \\"miracles\\" that may have occurred from the fresh waters. The local government has gone so far as to requalify the area around Fonta Santa, in order to attract further eco-friendly investments in the area. Related to these changes has also been the attempted preservation of local grist mills; yet, issues associated with local property rights have made attempts for full conservation complicated. Culture Much like other villages in the Tr√°s-os-Montas, Agueira is richly associated with festival, both religious and secular. Celebrations mark Christmas, the Epiphany, Carnival, Easter and traditional Dia do folar (first Monday of Easter), All Saints Day and summer festival.

It produces Melodyne, a popular audio pitch modification tool similar to Auto-Tune, although the program itself is a manual tuning software.  History  Celemony was founded in October 2000 by Peter Neub√§cker, Prof. Dr. Hildegard Sourgens and Carsten Gehle. It is based in Munich, Germany. In 2009, Melodyne won an MIPA Award for Most innovative product. In 2011, Celemony released Capstan, a stand-alone audio restoration software that eliminates wow and flutter from digital recordings. In October 2011, Celemony and PreSonus introduced Audio Random Access (ARA), an extension for audio plug-in formats like AU and VST that permits to exchange data between them which is supported by several DAWs.  Melodyne  Melodyne logo. Three years before Celemony was founded, Peter Neub√§cker was working on a research experiment with sound. This experiment later turned into the Melodyne pitch correction product. Melodyne has become a tool which is used by a large number of professional record producers worldwide to tune and manipulate audio signals, typically a singer's vocals. Melodyne also has facilities for time-stretching, rebuilding melodies. It can also be used to aid the creation of backing vocals from an existing lead vocal. The first public viewing of Melodyne was at the Winter NAMM Show in 2001 and it has since won various awards. As of May 2020, the current release is Melodyne 5. The most important new features of Version 5 relate to the correction of intonation on vocal tracks. The algorithm now detects the presence and extent of the unpitched (noise-like) components of the vocal sound as well as breaths, which it then processes separately from the pitched components. The volume balance between the pitched and unpitched components can be adjusted. New possibilities for dynamic contouring are afforded by the Fade Tool and the Leveling Macro, as they too work on a per-note basis, even with polyphonic audio material. With the Chord Track (and the Pitch Grid configured accordingly), recordings and samples can be adapted to the harmonic structure and chords of songs. Artists who use the software include Herbie Hancock, Bj√∂rk, Coldplay, Peter Gabriel, Eka Gustiwana Putra (alongside with Presonus StudioOne), and Thomas Newman. It is also used in classical music for the pitch analysis of speech. Composer Jonathan Harvey and IRCAM engineers used Melodyne to extract melodic material for his composition Speakings.  Direct Note Access  Schematic of polyphonic note separation & manipulation Direct Note Access (DNA) allows independent manipulation of individual notes within chords and polyphonic recordings. Originally announced at Musikmesse Frankfurt 2008 to be released at the end of that year, it was later postponed to Q1 2009, then finally released on 16 November 2009 as part of Melodyne editor. On 14 January 2016, Celemony integrated DNA into their multitrack software Melodyne studio (version 4).

Etymology The name Chittampara or Chittanpara is derived from Sidhan‚Äôs Para (Sage‚Äôs rock), which seems to refer to a Sage doing penance in the area. Sri Siddhi Vinayakar Temple This temple located 1 km South West of Sulthankada is dedicated to Lord Vinayaka is 21 years old. Although located near the public cemetery of native Tamils, the temple attracts young people in the area. During 1978, an elderly person who works as a Cardamom estate employee dreamt of an elephant calf running around near the area where the temple is currently located. But the other people did not take it seriously and ignored the same. Later a native of the area found an elephant shaped stone and installed the same on an erected place (Peettham). This murthy is worshipped as Yoga Ganapathi. The temple did not attract many gatherings of devotees, but there were few devotees who used to visit the area frequently. In the Year 1989, a small Shrine was constructed and the deity of Sidhi Vinayakar installed. Although the Lord is Grihastha (supposed to be with His wife Sidhi), the deity of the Goddess is not installed. A beautiful deity of Ngarja is installed at His right and Karthikeya at His left side (in the form of Vel or Spear). The grand Kumbhabhishekam was performed in the year 1991 by Vishveshwara Iyer from Chinnamannur. The main festivals in this temple are during Vinayaka jayanthi and Sabari Mala pooja days. All the deity faces towards East. The Main Deity is Sidhi Vinayakar and other Deities are Yoga Ganapathi, Nagaraja, Bhavani Devi, Sri Sasthavu and many of the devotees feel the presence of Siva & Parvathi here.

The houses are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The historical importance of the houses, in addition to their listing, is that they were designed by the Chester architect John Douglas, who lived in No. 33 for 20 years. Location The houses stand on the east side of Dee Banks in Great Boughton, Chester, about from the city centre, in an elevated position overlooking the River Dee, with views over meadowland towards the city. History The land on which the houses were constructed was owned by John Douglas; one of the houses (No. 33) was built for his own use and the other was probably an investment. From the time he moved to Chester in either 1855 or 1860, Douglas and his family lived in Abbey Square in the centre of the city, initially above his office at No. 6 and later next door at No. 4. Although the houses are dated 1869, the family did not move there until about 1876. Douglas' wife, Elizabeth, died in 1878, and Douglas continued to live with his family in 33 Dee Banks for a further 18 years until he built a large mansion, Walmoor Hill, for himself nearby in 1896. An oriel window was added to the upper storey of No. 31 in about 1945. Architecture Other than the oriel window, the building is symmetrical and it has two storeys; each house is a mirror-image of the other. It is constructed in brown brick with diapering in blue brick and some stone dressings; the roof is of grey-green slate. The building has six bays, three to each house. The central two bays project forwards and each is gabled; there are smaller gables over the outer bays. In each angle outside the central bays is a timber-framed porch and a small conservatory with a hipped roof. The lower storey has sash windows in both central and outer bays. Between the storeys is diapered brickwork. In the upper storey, No. 31 has a five-faced oriel window in its outer bay, while the corresponding window of No. 33 has a double-arched window. Above each porch is a triple-sash window. In each central bay is a pair of arched sash windows and over each of these is an inscribed circular panel. The inscription in the panel on No. 31 reads \\"JD\\" (for John Douglas), and that on No. 33 \\"V&A;\\" (for Victoria and Albert). Above the upper-storey windows in the outer bays is a small one-pane window and above the windows in the central bays is a pair of small arched windows. The roof is ridged. A pair of substantial brick chimneys rises from the centre of the building and another more slender chimney is at the lateral end of each ridge. The sandstone garden walls and gate piers are included in the listing. Douglas' biographer, Edward Hubbard, commented on the \\"quality of massiveness\\" of the houses in their \\"prominent site\\" above the river but notes that internally they were \\"quite modest in their scale and their fittings\\". He stated that originally on the garden walls were railings that consisted of widely spaced uprights with forked bases. Hubbard considered that the most characteristic features of Douglas on the houses are the timber-framed porches, the polychromic brickwork, and the ribbed brick chimneystacks.

The magazine was based in Sydney. History The Lone Hand was founded in 1907 by J. F. Archibald and Frank Fox as a monthly Australian magazine of literature and poetry as a sister magazine to The Bulletin. It was modelled on The London Strand.The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature William H Wilde, Joy Hooton and Barry Andrews Oxford University Press 2nd ed. 1994 Originally, Archibald had wanted the name Lone Hand for what became The Bulletin. Once the magazine was established, Archibald had little to do with its running. It tended to echo the themes of The Bulletin; Australian individuality and mateship, and support for the White Australia Policy. In common with The Bulletin, contributions from the public were solicited and paid for at the 'going rate'. A remarkable innovation was a prize offered to readers who found errors (including typo's) in advertisements and contributions. It also sponsored the first Australian beauty contest in 1908 (after a challenge by the Chicago Tribune), and featured columns by celebrities. The Lone Hand was an initial success. The first issue in May 1907 sold out its print run of 50,000 copies in three days; the second issue sold out in one. But two years later, faced with falling circulation and advertising revenue - mostly due to competition from overseas magazines, Fox instituted radical changes, adding a women's section and fashion photography. The price of the magazine was also dropped from 1 shilling to 6 pence, and the language used in its editorials was softened to engage a broader audience. In 1914 links with The Bulletin were cut. By 1919 the magazine was being published in a larger format, with more articles on higher quality paper. However, when the price was adjusted again to 9 pence, circulation dropped and continuing the production became unsustainable. February 1928 was the last issue published.

This includes remotely controlling how an incident electromagnetic wave (EM wave) interacts with a metamaterial. This means the capability to determine whether the EM wave is transmitted, reflected, or absorbed. In general, the lattice structure of the tunable metamaterial is adjustable in real time, making it possible to reconfigure a metamaterial device during operation. It encompasses developments beyond the bandwidth limitations in left-handed materials by constructing various types of metamaterials. The ongoing research in this domain includes electromagnetic materials that are very meta which mean good and has a band gap metamaterials (EBG), also known as photonic band gap (PBG), and negative refractive index material (NIM). \\"Tunable metamaterials imply the ability to continuously change their properties through an external influence or signal with the intrinsic mechanism of tunability.\\" * Free PDF download. *Self published version here Overview Since natural materials exhibit very weak coupling through the magnetic component of the electromagnetic wave, artificial materials that exhibit a strong magnetic coupling are being researched and fabricated. These artificial materials are known as metamaterials. The first of these were fabricated (in the lab) with an inherent, limited, response to only a narrow frequency band at any given time. Its main purpose was to practically demonstrate metamaterials. The resonant nature of metamaterials results in frequency dispersion and narrow bandwidth operation where the center frequency is fixed by the geometry and dimensions of the rudimentary elements comprising the metamaterial composite. These were followed by demonstrations of metamaterials that were tunable only by changing the geometry and/or position of their components. These have been followed by metamaterials that are tunable in wider frequency ranges along with strategies for varying the frequencies of a single medium (metamaterial). This is in contrast to the fixed frequency metamaterial, which is determined by the imbued parameters during fabrication. Tuning strategies for split ring resonators Metamaterial-based devices could come to include filters, modulators, amplifiers, transistors, and resonators, among others. The usefulness of such a device could be extended tremendously if the metamaterial‚Äôs response characteristics can be dynamically tuned. Control of the effective electromagnetic parameters of a metamaterial is possible through externally tunable components. Single element control Studies have examined the ability to control the response of individual particles using tunable devices such as varactor diodes, semiconductor materials, and barium strontium titanate (BST) thin films. For example, H. T. Chen, in 2008, were able to fabricate a repeating split-ring resonator (SRR) cell with semiconductor material aligning the gaps. This initial step in metamaterial research expanded the spectral range of operation for a given, specific, metamaterial device. Also this opened the door for implementing new device concepts. The importance of incorporating the semiconductor material this way is noted because of the higher frequency ranges at which this metamaterial operates. It is suitable at terahertz (THz) and higher frequencies, where the entire metamaterial composite may have more than 104 unit cells, along with bulk-vertical integration of the tuning elements. Strategies employed for tuning at lower frequencies would not be possible because of the number of unit cells involved. The semiconductor material, such as silicon, is controlled by photoexcitation. This in turn controls, or alters, the effective size of the capacitor and tunes the capacitance. The whole structure is not just semiconductor material. This was termed a 'hybrid', because the semiconductor material was fused with dielectric material; a silicon-on- sapphire (SOS) wafer. Wafers were then stacked - fabricating a whole structure. A. Degiron et al., appear to have used a similar strategy in 2007. A. Degiron, J. J. Mock, and D. R. Smith, Opt. Express 15, 3 (2007).

The negative permeability behavior appears to be dependent on the location and bandwidth of the ferrimagnetic resonance, a break from wholly non-magnetic materials, which produces a notable negative index band. A coil or permanent magnetic is needed to supply the magnetic field bias for tuning. Electrical tuning Electrical tuning for tunable metamaterials. Magnetostatic control Magnetostatic control for tunable metamaterials. Optical pumping Optical pumping for tunable metamaterials. Tunable NIMs using ferrite material Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films allow for a continuously tunable negative permeability, which results in a tunable frequency range over the higher frequency side of the ferromagnetic resonance of the YIG. Complementary negative permittivity is achieved using a single periodic array of copper wires. Eight wires were spaced 1 mm apart and a ferromagnetic film of a multi- layered YIG at 400 mm thickness was placed in a K band waveguide. The YIG film was applied to both sides of a gadolinium gallium garnet substrate of 0.5 mm thickness. Ferromagnetic resonance was induced when the external H magnetic field was applied along the X axis. The external magnetic field was generated with an electromagnet. Pairs of E‚ÄìH tuners were connected before and after the waveguide containing the NIM composite. The tunability was demonstrated from 18 to 23 GHz. Theoretical analysis, which followed, closely matched the experimental results. An air gap was built into the structure between the array of copper wires and the YIG. This reduces coupling with the ferrite, YIG material. When negative permeability is achieved across a range of frequencies, the interaction of the ferrite with the wires in close proximity, reduces the net current flow in the wires. This is the same as moving toward positive permittivity. This would be an undesired result as the material would no longer be a NIM. The separation also reduces the effective loss of the dielectric, induced by the interaction of the wire's self-field with permeability. Furthermore, there are two sources of conduction in the copper wire. First, the electric field in a (microwave) waveguide creates a current in the wire. Second, any arbitrary magnetic field created by the ferrite when it moves into a perpendicular configuration induces a current. Additionally, at frequencies where ¬µ is negative, the induced microwave magnetic field is opposite to the field excited in a TE10 mode of propagation in a waveguide. Hence, the induced current is opposite to the current resulting from the electric field in a waveguide. Metamaterial phase shifter In aerospace applications (for example) negative index metamaterials are likely candidates for tunable, compact and lightweight phase shifters. Because the designated metamaterials can handle the appropriate power levels, have strong dispersion characteristics, and are tunable in the microwave range these show potential to be desirable phase shifters. The YIG negative index metamaterial is a composite which actually utilizes ferrite material. As a metamaterial, the ferrite produces a resonant, (real) magnetic permeability Œº' that is large enough to be comparable to the conventional ferrite phase shifter. The advantage of using a ferrite NIM material for phase shifter application is that it allows use of a ferrite in the negative magnetic permeability region near the FMR (ferromagnetic resonance frequency) when is relatively high and still maintains low losses. Near the FMR frequency, the magnitude of Œº' is larger than that at frequencies away from it. Assuming the loss factor to be about the same for the NIM and the conventional ferrite phase shifter, we would expect a much improved performance using the NIM composite, since the phase shifts would be significantly higher owing to higher differential Œº'. Liquid crystal tuning for metamaterials Liquid crystal metamaterial tunable in the near-infrared Tuning in the near infrared range is accomplished by adjusting the permittivity of an attached nematic liquid crystal. The liquid crystal material appears to be used as both a substrate and a jacket for a negative index metamaterial. The metamaterial can be tuned from negative index values, to zero index, to positive index values. In addition, negative index values can be increased or decreased by this method. Tunability of wire-grid metamaterial immersed into nematic liquid crystal Sub-wavelength metal arrays, essentially another form of metamaterial, usually operate in the microwave and optical frequencies. A liquid crystal is both transparent and anisotropic at those frequencies. In addition, a liquid crystal has the inherent properties to be both intrinsically tunable and provide tuning for the metal arrays. This method of tuning a type of metamaterial can be readily used as electrodes for applying switching voltages. Tuning NIMs with liquid crystals Areas of active research in optical materials are metamaterials that are capable of negative values for index of refraction (NIMs), and metamaterials that are capable of zero index of refraction (ZIMs). Complicated steps required to fabricate these nano-scale metamaterials have led to the desire for fabricated, tunable structures capable of the prescribed spectral ranges or resonances. The most commonly applied scheme to achieve these effects is electro-optical tuning. Here the change in refractive index is proportional to either the applied electric field, or is proportional to the square modulus of the electric field. These are the Pockels effect and Kerr effect, respectively. However, to achieve these effects electrodes must be built-in during the fabrication process. This introduces problematic complexity into material formation techniques. Another alternative is to employ a nonlinear optical material as one of the constituents of this system, and depend on the optical field intensity to modify the refractive index, or magnetic parameters. Liquid crystal tuning of silicon-on-ring-resonators Ring resonators are optical devices designed to show resonance for specific wavelengths. In silicon-on- insulator layered structures, they can be very small, exhibit a high Q factor and have low losses that make them efficient wavelength-filters. The goal is to achieve a tunable refractive index over a larger bandwidth. Structural tunability in metamaterials A novel approach is proposed for efficient tuning of the transmission characteristics of metamaterials through a continuous adjustment of the lattice structure, and is confirmed experimentally in the microwave range. Hybrid metamaterial composites Metamaterials were originally researched as a passive response material. The passive response was and still is determined by the patterning of the metamaterial elements. In other words, the majority of research has focused on the passive properties of the novel transmission, e.g., the size and shape of the inclusions, the effects of metal film thickness, hole geometry, periodicity, with passive responses such as a negative electric response, negative index or gradient index etc. In addition, the resonant response can be significantly affected by depositing a dielectric layer on metal hole arrays and by doping a semiconductor substrate. The result is significant shifting of the resonance frequency. However, even these last two methods are part of the passive material research. Electromagnetic metamaterials can be viewed as structured composites with patterned metallic subwavelength inclusions. As mesoscopic physical systems, these are built starting from the unit cell level. These unit cells are designed to yield prescribed electromagnetic properties. A characteristic of this type of metamaterial is that the individual components have a resonant (coupling) response to the electric, magnetic or both components of the electromagnetic radiation of the source. The EM metamaterial as an artificially designed transmission medium, has so far delivered desired responses at frequencies from the microwave through to the near visible. The introduction of a natural semiconductor material within or as part of each metamaterial cell results in a new design flexibility. The incorporation, application, and location of semiconductor material is strategically planned so as to be strongly coupled at the resonance frequency of the metamaterial elements. The hybrid metamaterial composite is still a passive material. However, the coupling with the semiconductor material then allows for external stimulus and control of the hybrid system as a whole, which produces alterations in the passive metamaterial response. External excitation is produced in the form, for example, photoconductivity, nonlinearity, or gain in the semiconductor material. Tunable spectral range via electric field control Terahertz (THz) metamaterials can show a tunable spectral range, where the magnetic permeability reaches negative values. These values were established both theoretically and experimentally. The demonstrated principle represents a step forward toward a metamaterial with negative refractive index capable of covering continuously a broad range of THz frequencies and opens a path for the active manipulation of millimeter and submillimeter beams. Frequency selective surface based metamaterials Frequency selective surfaces (FSS) has become an alternative to the fixed frequency metamaterial where static geometries and spacings of unit cells determine the frequency response of a given metamaterial. Because arrayed unit cells maintain static positions throughout operation, a new set of geometrical shapes and spacings would have to be embedded in a newly fabricated material for each different radiated frequency and response. Instead, FSS based metamaterials allow for optional changes of frequencies in a single medium (metamaterial) rather than a restriction to a fixed frequency response. Frequency selective surfaces can be fabricated as planar 2-dimensional periodic arrays of metallic elements with specific geometrical shapes, or can be periodic apertures in a metallic screen. The transmission and reflection coefficients for these surfaces are dependent on the frequency of operation and may also depend on the polarization and the angle of the transmitted electromagnetic wave striking the material or angle of incidence. The versatility of these structures are shown when having frequency bands at which a given FSS is completely opaque (stop-bands) and other bands at which the same surface allows wave transmission. An example of where this alternative is highly advantageous is in deep space or with a satellite or telescope in orbit. The expense of regular space missions to access a single piece of equipment for tuning and maintenance would be prohibitive. Remote tuning, in this case, is advantageous. FSS was first developed to control the transmission and reflection characteristics of an incident radiation wave. This has resulted in smaller cell size along with increases in bandwidth and the capability to shift frequencies in real time for artificial materials. This type of structure can be used to create a metamaterial surface with the intended application of artificial magnetic conductors or applications for boundary conditions. Another application is as stop band device for surface wave propagation along the interface. This is because surface waves are a created as a consequence of an interface between two media having dissimilar refractive indices. Depending on the application of the system that includes the two media, there may be a need to attenuate surface waves or utilize them. An FSS based metamaterial employs a (miniature) model of equivalent LC circuitry. At low frequencies the physics of the interactions is essentially defined by the LC model analysis and numerical simulation. This is also known as the static LC model. At higher frequencies the static LC concepts become unavailable. This is due to dependence on phasing. When the FSS is engineered for electromagnetic band gap (EBG) characteristics, the FSS is designed to enlarge its stop band properties in relation to dispersive, surface wave (SW) frequencies (microwave and radio frequencies). Furthermore, as an EBG it is designed to reduce its dependence on the propagating direction of the surface wave traveling across the surface (interface). Artificial magnetic conductors and High impedance surfaces A type of FSS based metamaterial has the interchangeable nomenclature Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) or High Impedance Surface (HIS). The HIS, or AMC, is an artificial, metallic, electromagnetic structure. The structure is designed to be selective in supporting surface wave currents, different from conventional metallic conductors. It has applications for microwave circuits and antennas. As an antenna ground plane it suppresses the propagation of surface waves, and deployed as an improvement over the flat metal sheet as a ground plane, or reflector. Hence, this strategy tends to upgrade the performance of the selected antenna. Strong surface waves of sufficient strength, which propagate on the metal ground plane will reach the edge and propagate into free space. This creates a multi-path interference. In contrast the HIS surface suppresses the propagation of surface waves. Furthermore, control of the radio frequency or microwave radiation pattern is efficiently increased, and mutual coupling between antennas is also reduced. When employing conventional ground planes as the experimental control, the HIS surface exhibits a smoother radiation pattern, an increase in the gain of the main lobe, a decrease in undesirable return radiation, and a decrease in mutual coupling. See: \\"Application of High Impedance Electromagnetic Surface to Archimedean Planner Spiral Antenna,\\" Microwave and Optical Technology Letters, January 2007, p. 129. Description An HIS, or AMC, can be described as a type of electromagnetic band gap (EBG) material or a type of synthetic composite that is intentionally structured with a magnetic conductor surface for an allotted, but defined range of frequencies. AMC, or HIS structures often emerge from an engineered periodic dielectric base along with metallization patterns designed for microwave and radio frequencies. The metalization pattern is usually determined by the intended application of the AMC or HIS structure. Furthermore, two inherent notable properties, which cannot be found in natural materials, have led to a significant number of microwave circuit applications. First, AMC or HIS surfaces are designed to have an allotted set of frequencies over which electromagnetic surface waves and currents will not be allowed to propagate. These materials are then both beneficial and practical as antenna ground planes, small flat signal processing filters, or filters as part of waveguide structures. For example, AMC surfaces as antenna ground planes are able to effectively attenuate undesirable wave fluctuations, or undulations, while producing good radiation patterns. This is because the material can suppress surface wave propagation within the prescribed range of forbidden frequencies. Second, AMC surfaces have very high surface impedance within a specific frequency range, where the tangential magnetic field is small, even with a large electric field along the surface. Therefore, an AMC surface can have a reflection coefficient of +1. In addition, the reflection phase of incident light is part of the AMC and HIS tool box.When light goes from one medium (n-1) to another (n-2), the reflected light at that interface undergoes a phase change as follows: if n-1 < n-2 there is a 180 degree phase change. However, if n-1 > n-2: no phase change. The phase of the reflected electric field has normal incidence the same phase of the electric field impinging at the interface of the reflecting surface. The variation of the reflection phase is continuous between +180‚ó¶ to ‚àí180‚ó¶ relative to the frequency. Zero is crossed at one frequency, where resonance occurs. A notable characteristic is that the useful bandwidth of an AMC is generally defined as +90‚ó¶ to ‚àí90‚ó¶ on either side of the central frequency. Thus, due to this unusual boundary condition, in contrast to the case of a conventional metal ground plane, an AMC surface can function as a new type of ground plane for low-profile wire antennas (wireless communication systems). For example, even though a horizontal wire antenna is extremely close to an AMC surface, the current on the antenna and its image current on the ground plane are in-phase, rather than out-of phase, thereby strengthening the radiation.

The configuration creates a capacitive and inductive surface. It can be utilized as band gap material at prescribed frequencies. It is also designed to enhance antenna operation as a novel periodic material. Frequency selective surfaces (FSS) materials can be utilized as band gap material in the surface wave domain, at microwave and radio frequency wavelengths. Support of surface waves is a given property of metals. These are propagating electromagnetic waves that are bound to the interface between the metal surface and the air. Surface plasmons occur at optical frequencies, but at microwave frequencies, they are the normal currents that occur on any electrical conductor. At radio frequencies, the fields associated with surface waves can extend thousands of wavelengths into the surrounding space, and they are often best described as surface currents. They can be modeled from the viewpoint of an effective dielectric constant, or an effective surface impedance. For example, a flat metal sheet always has low surface impedance. However, by incorporating a special texture on a conducting surface, a specially designed geometry, it is possible to engineer a high surface impedance and alter its electromagnetic-radio-frequency properties. The protrusions are arranged in a two dimensional lattice structure, and can be visualized as thumbtacks protruding from the surface. Because the protrusions are fractionally smaller than the operating wavelength, the structure can be described using an effective medium model, and the electromagnetic properties can be described using lumped-circuit elements (capacitors and inductors). They behave as a network of parallel resonant LC circuits, which act as a two- dimensional electric filter to block the flow of currents along the sheet. This structure can then serve as an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC), because of its high surface impedance within a certain frequency range. In addition, as an artificial magnetic conductor it has a forbidden frequency band, over which surface waves and currents cannot propagate. Therefore, AMC surfaces have good radiation patterns without unwanted ripples based on suppressing the surface wave propagation within the band gap frequency range. The surface impedance is derived from the ratio of the electric field at the surface to the magnetic field at the surface, which extends far into the metal beyond the skin depth. When a texture is applied to the metal surface, the surface impedance is altered, and its surface wave properties are changed. At low frequencies, it is inductive, and supports transverse-magnetic (TM) waves. At high frequencies, it is capacitive, and supports transverse electric (TE) waves. Near the LC resonance frequency, the surface impedance is very high. In this region, waves are not bound to the surface. Instead, they radiate into the surrounding space. A high-impedance surface was fabricated as a printed circuit board. The structure consists of a triangular lattice of hexagonal metal plates, connected to a solid metal sheet by vertical conducting vias. Uniplanar compact photonic-bandgap The uniplanar compact photonic-bandgap (UC-PBG) is proposed, simulated, and then constructed in the lab to overcome elucidated limitations of planar circuit technology. Like photonic bandgap structures it is etched into the ground plane of the microstrip line. The geometry is square metal pads. Each metal pad has four connecting branches forming a distributed LC circuit.

Life Born on 1 November 1671, he was son of Richard Hare of Leigh, Essex. His mother, his father's second wife, was Sarah, daughter of Thomas Naylor. He was educated at Eton College, and admitted in 1688 to King's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1692, M.A. in 1696, and D.D. in 1708. At Cambridge he was tutor of Robert Walpole and the Marquis of Blandford, son of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who died in his college on 20 February 1703. In 1704 Hare was appointed chaplain-general to the army in Flanders. He described the campaign of 1704 in a series of letters to his cousin, George Naylor of Herstmonceux Castle, and in a journal preserved by William Coxe. In 1710 he again joined the camp at Douai. Hare received a royal chaplaincy under Queen Anne, and he was elected fellow of Eton in October 1712. He was rector of Barnes, Surrey, 1713 to 1723, and held a prebend in St Paul's Cathedral from 1707 till his death. In 1715 he was appointed dean of Worcester, and in 1722 Henry Pelham, younger brother of his sister-in-law, Lady Grace Naylor, being two of the children of Thomas Pelham, 1st Baron Pelham, made him usher to the exchequer. In October 1726 he exchanged Worcester for the deanery of St Paul's, which he held till his death, and on 19 December 1727 was consecrated bishop of St Asaph. He had been dismissed from his chaplaincy about 1718, in consequence of his share in the Bangorian controversy, when he joined the assailants of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly. On the accession of George II, he was in favour with Queen Caroline. She intended him for the see of Bath and Wells, but the ministry was against giving the best preferments to newly consecrated bishops. Hare's fame as a preacher at this time is shown by a complimentary allusion in the Dunciad. In 1731 Hare was translated from the see of St Asaph to that of Chichester. In 1736 Sir Robert Walpole, godfather of his son Robert, proposed him as successor to Archbishop William Wake, then rapidly failing. But Hare had recently opposed the government in some measures for the relief of dissenters; and John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, who had encountered him on that occasion, lobbied successfully against the appointment, pointing out truly that the sharp-tongued and isolated Hare was unpopular. On 26 April 1740 Hare died at the Vache, and was buried in a mausoleum which he had built for his family adjoining the nearby church of Chalfont St Giles. Works Hare was a prolific author. Feud with Bentley He had been an old friend of Richard Bentley, to whom he addressed in 1713 The clergyman's thanks to Phileleutherus (Bentley's pseudonym in the controversy with Anthony Collins). They were estranged in part by Hare's support of John Colbatch. In 1724 Hare published an edition of Terence based upon that of Fa√´rnius (Gabriel Faerne), and with notes founded partly on previous communications from Bentley, who had intended to publish an edition himself. The vexed Bentley published his own edition with notes, bitterly attacking Hare, and soon after issued an edition of Phaedrus, in order to anticipate a proposed edition by Hare. Hare retaliated in an Epistola Critica in 1727, addressed to Henry Bland, head- master of Eton, claiming many errors in his rival's edition. Hare's Latin scholarship was praised by Samuel Parr and by James Henry Monk. Psalms In 1736 Hare published an edition of the Psalms in Hebrew. Dr. Richard Grey, in the preface to his Hebrew Grammar declared that it restored the text in several places to its original beauty. But Hare's theory of Hebrew versification was confuted by Robert Lowth in 1766, and feebly defended by Thomas Edwards. Controversies Hare was involved in various controversies. He defended Marlborough and the War of the Spanish Succession in pamphlets, publishing * in 1711 The Allies and the Late Ministry defended against France in 4 parts,archive.org: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4 a rejoinder to Jonathan Swift's Conduct of the Allies; * Management of the War 1711; * Conduct of the Duke of Marlborough during the present War 1712; * and other tracts in defence of the negotiations of 1719 and the Barrier treaty. A thanksgiving sermon on the taking of Bouchain (preached by Hare 9 September 1711) was ridiculed by Swift in A Learned Comment. A sermon on King Charles's martyrdom (preached 1731) produced six pamphlets in its defence. A tract published in 1714, entitled Difficulties and Discouragements which attend the Study of the Scriptures in the way of Private Judgement was censured by convocation. It was taken to be ironical; but it is not very clear whether or not he meant to defend Samuel Clarke and William Whiston. It was often reprinted. Hare contributed to the Bangorian controversy Church Authority Vindicated in 1719 (a sermon which went through five editions), and was answered by Hoadly. Hare retorted in Scripture vindicated from the misrepresentations of the Bishop of Bangor 1721, and an ironical 'new defence' of the bishop's sermon. These are all collected in his works in four volumes (1746 and 1755), where the complimentary letter of 1713 to Bentley is omitted as inconsistent with the later attack on his Phaedrus. Patronage Among other learned men, Hare was the patron of Jeremiah Markland, who dedicated his edition of Statius to him. He also made efforts to advance the career of William Warburton. Family In the autumn of 1709 he married his first cousin, Bethaia Naylor, who became the heiress of Herstmonceux on the death of her brother's only daughter, Grace. While visiting his paternal estates near Faversham, Hare became acquainted with Joseph Alston of Edwardstone, Suffolk, whose eldest daughter, Mary Margaret, became his second wife in April 1728, and brought him a large fortune in the estates of Newhouse, Suffolk, the ancient manor of Hos-Tendis, near Skulthorpe in Norfolk, and The Vache, an estate near Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire. At the Vache they always resided during the latter years of his life, and there the seven children of his second marriage were born. The estates of Hurstmonceaux came to his first son Francis, by Bethaia, who took the name of Hare-Naylor. Hare brought up his son strictly, obliging him to speak Greek in the family. Francis gave the bishop trouble by a wild life, and then by engaging himself to his stepmother's sister, Carlotta Alston. The bishop prevented this marriage in his lifetime, but it took place after his death. Another son, Robert, was father of Francis Hare-Naylor.

This list of American saints and beatified people includes not only saints of the Catholic Church but also those who are not yet recognized as saints but as beati, venerabili, servants of God or candidates for sainthood and who are significantly associated with what was either at the time, or subsequently became, the United States of America. Roman Catholicism in the United States started at the country's earliest history. Indeed, Columbus's expedition of 1492 included Catholic priests among the crew. Catholic missionaries were some of the first explorers in French North America and British North America in the east, and Spanish North America in the Southwestern United States.

The charity assists those facing capital trial and punishment around the world, particularly in the United States, by providing proper legal representation and raising awareness of potential abuses of defendants' rights. Amicus was founded in 1992, in memory of Andrew Lee Jones - the Lifelines penpal of Jane Officer. Andrew was executed in the state of Louisiana in 1991. Mission statement The charity's objectives are: > \\"To assist in the provision of legal representation for those awaiting > capital trial and punishment in the US, or any other country, and to raise > awareness of potential abuses of defendants‚Äô rights.\\"  Main activities  Amicus focuses on a number of areas of activity: Internships, Training and Legal Education, Casework, Events, Membership and a Journal. In addition, the charity also hosts frequent charity social events including wine-tastings and academic panel discussions, often featuring prominent speakers. Internships For application details, visit the Amicus website. US Internships: Amicus places legal interns in pre-trial, appellate and research offices of capital defence attorneys throughout the US - it currently has 18 affiliate offices across 11 different states (including Florida, Texas and Georgia). Many US defender offices operate within severe funding constraints. As capital defenders face severe funding constraints, Amicus interns provide vital support and carry out work that simply would not be done without them. UK Internships Occasionally, Amicus have volunteer internship opportunities in our London office. All positions require a minimum time commitment of 14 hours per week for three months. Do note that unfortunately they are currently unable to offer expenses. Amicus looks for individuals that are responsible, motivated and able to work on their own initiative. The ideal candidates will also be flexible, able to work as part of a small team and committed to human rights. Keep an eye out on their website for vacancies. Training and legal education A US Death Penalty training course, based in London, runs twice a year in March and October. These focus on drafting amicus curiae briefs, motions and international legal applications and training for conducting research on behalf of defence attorneys. The course is accredited for 21 Continuing Professional Development (CPD) points with the Law Society and the Bar Council. Speakers at previous include Sunny Jacobs and Peter Pringle (death row exonerees), Russell Stetler (National Mitigation Coordinator for the federal death penalty projects), George Kendall (U.S. Counsel specialising in capital, criminal and civil rights cases), Jennifer Merrigan (Capital Attorney and Mitigation Specialist), Raoul Schonemann and Jim Marcus (both clinical professors and co-directors of the Capital Punishment Clinic, University of Texas). In order to be eligible for Amicus internships in the US, individuals must have completed the training course within 3 years of their application. Amicus collaborates with the Middle Temple Library to ensure that the public has access to US constitutional and capital punishment criminal texts. The Capital Punishment Collection, a collection of historical material, textbooks, reports and personal accounts from countries around the world that still retain the death penalty is housed alongside the Library's existing American Collection - the largest collection of US legal materials in London (founded in the 1920s), both of which can be found on the third floor of the library. Casework At the request of capital defence attorneys, Amicus has drafted amicus curiae briefs for a number of American courts, including the United States Supreme Court. Amicus case-workers also draft motions for use before and during trials and appeals, such as motions against the use of gruesome photographs. They also assist with drafting clemency statements and petitions in a number of states. In addition, Amicus provides experienced lawyers to argue before international courts. The jurisdiction of the Privy Council in London means that they have argued many of the issues that relate to the death penalty in the US. Amicus lawyers have, in the past, argued cases before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and drafted applications to the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights , headquartered in Washington DC. Amicus also provides trial observers to monitor the legal process in various jurisdictions around the world. During 2011 Amicus had approximately 200 volunteers working on eight individual cases. Events Amicus holds events to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the application of the death penalty in the US. Since 2004, the charity has built on its existing events programme in London and Birmingham, holding a variety of regional events and activities in Manchester, Oxford, Newcastle and Leeds. In November 2016, the charity held 'Art for Amicus' at Temple Church. It was both an exhibition and auction of paintings created by prisoners currently on death row in the U.S. There was also a performance from contemporary artist and performer Bob and Roberta Smith and a Q&A; with prominent comedian Reginald D. Hunter. Currently, Amicus is running a series of yoga sessions, 'Yoga for Ommmicus' in Middle Temple Lane run by yoga instructor and barrister Laura Phillips. The sessions are inspired by Sunny Jacobs, an exoneree who practised yoga whilst on death row. Membership  A popular way of supporting the charities is to become a member. Both regular and student memberships are available on their website and, in return, members receive the following: * Priority booking and reduced rates for Amicus events and training * Subscription to our monthly e-newsletter with the opportunity to contribute * Access to the Capital Punishment Collection in Middle Temple Library * Subscription to the Amicus journal (e-copies for student members, e-copies and hardcopies for regular members) Journal The Amicus Journal is the leading reporter on the significant issues affecting capital punishment worldwide.

Thanedar was a candidate in the Democratic Party primary for Governor of Michigan in the 2018 election. Thanedar won the City of Detroit and earned 200,645 total votes but finished in 3rd place statewide behind current Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer and former Health Director of Detroit Abdul El-Sayed. Following the 2018 election, Thanedar moved to Detroit and started a 2020 election campaign for the 3rd District of Michigan House of Representatives. Early life and education Thanedar grew up in a lower-income family in Belgaum, India. When his father was forced to retire at age 55, a 14-year-old Thanedar worked odd jobs to support his family of eight. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry at 18 and then attended a masters program at University of Bombay. He came to the United States in 1979 to pursue a PhD at the University of Akron, which he earned in 1982. Thanedar became a US citizen in 1988. Business career Thanedar did post-doctoral work at the University of Michigan before taking a job in 1984 as a researcher at Petrolite Corp.  Chemir  In 1990, Thanedar took a job working nights and weekends for $15/hour at Chemir/Polytech Laboratories to learn the business. Thanedar took out a loan to buy Chemir in 1991 for $75,000. Sales in the first year were $150,000 and the business had three employees. By 2005, Chemir's revenues were $16 million and it employed 160 people, including 40 PhD chemists. Thanedar borrowed $24 million from Bank of America to finance seven acquisitions, offering the bank a personal guarantee to back the debt. One acquisition, Azopharma, grew rapidly from $1 million in 2003 to $55 million in 2008. Thanedar's group of companies employed 500 people in 2008. During the 2007‚Äì10 recession in the United States, Azopharma's revenue fell by 70 percent, triggering bankruptcy proceedings by Bank of America. Azopharma was closed and its assets were sold for $2 million. During the bankruptcy proceedings, AniClin, one of Azopharma's research facilities of which Thanedar was the sole owner, was abruptly closed; a 2010 USA Today article claimed that laboratory animals were abandoned at the facility after the company was placed in receivership. Later reports state that animal welfare organizations successfully facilitated the adoption of all animals in the facility and Thanedar denied claims that any animals were abandoned. Chemir remained profitable throughout the legal proceedings and was sold on March 31, 2011, for $23 million.Chemir auctioned off for $23 million That sale plus the combined assets in the firm covered Thanedar's debt to Bank of America.  Avomeen  Thanedar briefly retired in 2010, then came out of retirement later that year to launch Avomeen Analytical Services, an Ann Arbor-based chemical testing laboratory, with his son Neil. Avomeen was named to the INC 5000 list of fastest-growing companies in the United States in 2015 (#673) and 2016 (#1365). In 2016 Thanedar sold a majority stake in the business to private equity firm High Street Capital. Thanedar shared $1.5 million of his sale proceeds with his 50 employees. Thanedar was named the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year for the Central Midwest Region (Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska) in 1999, 2007, and 2016.2007 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award, for the Central Midwest Region Lawsuit In November 2017, a buyer of Avomeen Holdings LLC filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Detroit, claiming Thanedar made \\"fraudulent and misleading representations\\" of his company's finances in order to sell the majority stake in November 2016. Thanedar denies the allegations, stating that revenues \\"are anticipated to significantly exceed\\" those of past periods. Thanedar maintains 40 percent ownership of Avomeen. Political career Shri Thanedar entered politics when he chose to run in the 2018 Michigan gubernatorial election as a Democrat. Thanedar's political platform includes a $15 minimum wage, public education reform, infrastructure improvements, and increased government transparency. 2018 gubernatorial campaign On April 5, 2017, Shri Thanedar submitted paperwork to raise funds for a potential gubernatorial campaign in Michigan. On June 8, 2017, Thanedar officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Michigan in the 2018 Democratic Party primary. Thanedar pledged not to accept any corporate political action committee donations. Thanedar contributed $10.6 million of his own money to his campaign. Early polling in 2017 showed Thanedar in last place at 2% to 3%. After running a statewide Super Bowl ad in February 2018, Thanedar quickly became the best-known Democratic candidate running for Governor of Michigan. Thanedar won statewide Democratic polls in March (21% to 18%) and April (30% to 26%) versus Gretchen Whitmer, the presumed Democratic front-runner. As Thanedar's campaign gained public traction in early 2018, reporters at The Intercept and HuffPost began investigating Thanedar's history. Thanedar had not held elective office before running for Governor of Michigan in 2017, so he did not have an official record as a Democrat. Campaign finance records show that Thanedar made 18 donations to Democratic campaigns and 1 donation to a Republican campaign prior to running for office. However, that one Republican donation, $2,300 to the Republican presidential campaign of John McCain, led to controversy that Thanedar may not be as progressive as he claimed. Political strategists who met with Thanedar before his 2018 campaign also claimed that Thanedar initially questioned whether he wanted to run as a Democrat or Republican in the gubernatorial race. Thanedar denied the claims, stating that he was being criticized by these strategists because he did not hire their firms. Thanedar also faced accusations that laboratory animals were abandoned at one of his former research facilities after that business was placed into receivership by Bank of America in 2010, claims that were denied by Thanedar and later reports. These controversies hurt Thanedar's campaign and he failed to poll over 30% again. On August 7, 2018, Thanedar received 200,645 votes in the Democratic Party primary (17.7%), placing him in third behind Gretchen Whitmer's 588,436 votes (52.0%) and Abdul El-Sayed's 342,179 votes (30.2%). Thanedar's support was heavily concentrated in cities like Detroit, Flint, Inkster, and Pontiac with high African American populations. Thanedar's campaign had spent more money than any other candidate running in either the Democratic or Republican gubernatorial primaries. The roughly $10.3 million his campaign spent accounted for nearly one third of the cumulative spending of all candidates in the primaries.  2020 State Representative Campaign  In August 2019, Shri Thanedar submitted paperwork to run for State Representative in Michigan's 3rd District which represents a portion of North Detroit. On August 4, 2020, Thanedar won the Democratic primary for the state house seat. Autobiographies Thanedar has written two autobiographies. ‡§π‡•Ä '‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä' ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§á‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ !

It was filmed from March to May 2009, and stars Jacky Cheung and Tang Wei. It is a remake of Crossing Delancey (1988). It is a return to film both for Cheung, who has not appeared in a film for several years, and for Tang, who was banned from acting in mainland China after appearing in Ang Lee's 2007 Lust, Caution. It is the second film directed by Ho (who began her career as a screenwriter). Other actors in the film include Danny Lee Sau-Yin, Paw Hee-Ching, Maggie Cheung Ho-yee, and Andy On. The story mainly takes place around Hennessy Road, in Hong Kong Island's Causeway Bay and Wan Chai districts. In May 2009 it was announced that the film would be shown at the Cannes Film Festival. It will also be shown at the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival alongside Clara Law's \\"Like a Dream\\" as a kick start for the opening event.  Music and soundtrack  The soundtrack album for Crossing Hennessy was composed by Anthony Chue. The end credit song, \\"‰∏çÂè™ÊúâÁ∑£ (Lucky in Love)\\", was written by Roxanne Seeman and Daniel Nitt. Plot Loy (Jacky Cheung) is a 41-year-old bachelor who lives with his widowed mother (Paw Hee-Ching) and aunt (Chu Mi- Mi) in Wan Chai. Loy's mother, disappointed by his bachelorhood, often sets up match-making lunches for him with various girls. On the other side of Hennessy, orphaned Oi Lin (Tang Wei) lives with and works for her uncle and aunt in a bathroom appliances store on Lockhart Road. She is in a relationship with Xu (Andy On), who is in prison. Her uncle, who disapproves of Xu, sets up a match-making lunch for her and Loy. Neither Loy or Oi Lin are attracted to one another, but the families continue to set up meetings for the two. After a few meetings and dates, the two eventually strike up a friendship after discovering a mutual interest in detective stories. Both Loy and Oi Lin's families misunderstand the newfound friendship as romance and begin discussing wedding banquet arrangements. Loy explains to his mother this is not the case, and that Oi Lin has a boyfriend. Annoyed, Loy's mother calls Oi Lin's aunt and yells at her, calling her and her husband cheats. Oi Lin becomes upset with Loy, and breaks off their friendship. During this time she shares a flat with her boyfriend Xu, who has just been released from prison, and Loy gets back together with his ex-girlfriend Man Yu (Maggie Cheung Ho-yee). As time passes, Loy and Oi Lin grow increasingly uneasy about their relationships with Man Yu and Xu respectively. Loy tells Man Yu that he is finally in love with someone, but does not know if he is good enough for her. In the meantime, Oi Lin breaks up with Xu. Furious, Xu tracks down Loy and beats him up. Loy, though severely injured and no match for Xu, claims he is the better man because he can make Oi Lin smile. Xu finally understands, and leaves Oi Lin to get on with her life. Loy's mother finally marries her accountant at the Cotton Tree Drive Marriage Registry to everyone's delight. After the wedding, Loy goes to the Cha Chaan Teng (where he'd previously had a date with Oi Lin) and finds Oi Lin. He joins her there, and the two enjoy the afternoon together. Reception Critics gave generally positive reviews, and Tang Wei in particularly received praise for her work. Perry Lam of Muse Magazine, for example, comments that Tang 'exudes charisma and star appeal, even in jeans and sneakers, but I have no doubt that she could have stretched her role a lot further if the script had allowed her.'

Only two prototypes were built before the USMC scrapped the idea of glider use in 1943. Development Inspired by the use of gliders by Germany, the United States Navy and USMC initiated a glider program in May 1941. Two glider types were envisioned, a 12-seat and a 24 seat-type. The Naval Aircraft Factory was requested to undertake preliminary design of the gliders, which were to be constructed of wood or composite materials. The idea was to have enough gliders to transport one battalion of Marines (715 men) with equipment. Consolidated PBYs should be used to tow the gliders. The Marines requested a glider capable of landing and take off from both land and water, be capable of static line parachute jumping and have exterior machine guns. In 1942, the USMC established Marine Glider Group 71 at Page Field, Parris Island, South Carolina (USA), using the Schweizer LNS-1 and Pratt-Read LNE-1, later also Aeronca LNR-1 gliders for training. For towing the unit used N3N Canary biplane trainers and J2F Duck amphibians. Design For the 12-seat type the beach assault role in mind, the U.S. Navy ordered prototypes, the Allied Aviation Corporation XLRA-1 and the Bristol Aeronautical Corporation XLRQ-1. Technically, the gliders were successful designs, and 100 of each were ordered. Also a licence production by the Naval Aircraft Factory as the LRN-1 was envisioned. Although the U.S. Navy ordered four XLRQ-1 prototypes, only two were built (BuNos 11561 and 11562). The glider had a retractable landing gear and the wing roots provided lateral stability on the water. However, glider assault was not tactically feasible against small, heavily defended islands in the Pacific, not enough gliders were arriving from factories and too many pilots were being assigned to the glider program.pp. 15-16 Grim, J.

He was the longest-serving chaplain to the University of Cambridge, England. He has been described as the best-known Roman Catholic priest in England during the last quarter of the 20th century. Early life (1901‚Äì1932) Gilbey was born at Mark Hall, near Harlow, Essex, on 13 July 1901, fifth son of Newman Gilbey, JP and Mar√≠a Victorina de Ysasi. Newman Gilbey's father, Alfred, of Wooburn House, Wooburn, Buckinghamshire, had founded a successful wine business with his brother, Sir Walter Gilbey, 1st Baronet.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-monsignor- alfred-gilbey-1152936.htmlBurke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 2, ed. Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 1549 A maternal great-grandfather was Don Manuel Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez y Angel, founder of wine and sherry bodega Gonz√°lez Byass. Educated by Jesuits at Beaumont College, he went on to study modern history at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1920, during which time he became chairman of the Fisher Society at the chaplaincy; he was also a member the University Pitt Club. He funded his own training as a priest at the Pontifical Beda College in Rome, being ordained \\"under his own patrimony\\" by Bishop Doubleday of Brentwood in 1929. Fisher House and retirement (1932‚Äì1998) In 1932, Gilbey became Catholic chaplain to the University of Cambridge, residing at Fisher House. Gilbey exerted a quiet but considerable influence around the university, maintaining links with the colleges and overseeing many converts to Catholicism. He was instrumental in defending Fisher House, as from 1949 the Cambridge City Council planned to demolish the buildings in the area to make way for the Lion Yard development. After petitioning led by Gilbey, who maintained that the chaplaincy would be demolished \\"over his dead body\\", Fisher House was spared from the compulsory purchase order and remains standing to this day. Gilbey retired from the chaplaincy in 1965, the final year of the Second Vatican Council. Unhappy with the Fisher Society's decision to admit women to the chaplaincy, who had been allowed to be full members of the university in 1947, Gilbey decided to leave rather than compromise his traditionalist beliefs. He took up permanent residence at the Travellers Club in London, remaining active into his nineties. During this time he wrote the catechetical book, We Believe (1983), making a trip to the United States in 1995 to promote it. Death and legacy In early 1998, Gilbey moved to Nazareth House in Hammersmith, London, a nursing home. He died two months later, on 26 March 1998. His funeral was held in the Brompton Oratory on 6 April with a Tridentine Solemn Mass. He is buried in the courtyard of Fisher House in Cambridge. A Requiem Mass for the repose of his soul is sung, again in the Tridentine form, annually at Trinity College.

Vacancy The election was triggered by the resignation of the sitting Conservative MP, Andrew Murray. Murray held the post of Secretary of State for Scotland with a seat in the Cabinet. In January 1905, Murray was appointed Lord Justice General and Lord President of the Court of Session and was given a seat in the House of Lords.The Times, 31 January 1905 p9 At the previous General Election, he had withstood the Liberal challenge: Candidates Unionists The Conservative Party selected Edward Theodore Salvesen, the Solicitor General for Scotland, as their candidate. Salvesen had fought the Leith Burghs seat as a Unionist at the general election of 1900.The Times, 17 August 1900 p6 Liberals The Liberals re-selected their candidate from the 1900 general election Norman Lamont. Lamont came from a prominent and wealthy local family with lands in Argyll and a plantation in Trinidad. His father had been Liberal MP for Buteshire from 1865‚Äì1868.A G E Jones, Sir James Lamont in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; OUP 2004‚Äì09 Tariff Reform candidate It was reported that at one time it looked likely there would be a three-cornered contest. A Mr. Sinclair, a convinced tariff reformer had issued an address to the electors as soon it had become known there was a Parliamentary vacancy. However Sinclair decided not to stand. It soon became clear that his supporters were content with the selection of Salvesen by the Tories as he was a member of the Tariff Reform League and had stated that if necessary he would be prepared to see the policy of Joseph Chamberlain on Imperial Preference adopted in full measure.The Times, 24 February 1905 p10 Issues Tariff Reform Salvesen took advantage of his position as a Tariff Reformer to consolidate his support among the Unionist voters. A significant number of Buteshire electors were middle-class merchants and others doing business in Glasgow but who had villa residences in towns in the constituency like Rothesay and Millport and good number were Unionist supporters who were generally favourable to tariff reform. Conservative efforts to win the election was particularly focused on these voters as it was felt that apathy in this key part of the electorate had been responsible for the narrowness of Graham's win over Lamont at the 1900 general election. Lamont campaigned as a traditional Liberal free trader, although he was challenged on his previous support for a form of retaliatory duty to protect West Indian sugar producers from unfair foreign competition, which policy he now renounced.The Times, 1 March 1905 p10 Chinese labour After the Boer War the government of Arthur Balfour had agreed to let the owners of the South African gold mines bring in thousands of indentured labourers of Chinese ethnicity to work in the mines. They lived under harsh conditions, in compounds they were not allowed to leave, worked long hours for little reward and were subject to corporal punishment. The issue was taken up by the Liberal Party under the slogan of 'Chinese slavery' both as a crusade for humanitarianism but also to exploit fear amongst British workers that the Conservative government might allow similar immigration to Britain, threatening British jobs.Colin Cross, The Liberals in Power:1905‚Äì1914; Barrie & Rockcliffe, 1963 pp. 18‚Äì19 The issue was raised in Buteshire but was given an added salience because it was alleged against Lamont that the Coolie labour (as it was referred to in Edwardian times) on his West Indian property were similarly indentured and that it was hypocritical of him to object to the practice in the Transvaal. Lamont was able to deflect this attack by showing he had removed the indenture system when he succeeded to the property and that the workers were now retained in an arrangement akin to being tenant farmers. His supporters also made political capital from the fact that Lamont had been the subject of what they chose to characterise as an unwarranted and brutal assault. Home Rule The question of Irish Home Rule was an ever-present in the election. The letter of support which Balfour sent to Salvesen for publication highlighted the difference between the parties on this issue. Lamont seemed to think Balfour's intervention on Home Rule strengthened the Liberal vote however. He was said to have received the votes of the Irish catholic electors, who numbered around 200.The Times, 6 March 1905 p11 Other issues Apart from the specific points of conflict mentioned above, the by-election was fought principally on the basis of the government candidate defending the government record and the opposition candidate promoting the need for change. Result The result of the by-election was a gain for the Liberals, albeit by a narrow margin. Lamont turned a Unionist majority of 195 at the previous general election into a Liberal majority of 34.The Times House of Commons 1910, Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2004, p99 In this context Lamont's collection of the Irish vote seems particularly significant and perhaps the resolve of this constituency to come out and vote on the issue of Home Rule was stiffened by Balfour's focussing on it in his letter of support to Salvesen. However, Salvesen stated after the election that the Unionist vote had polled at its full strength and Buteshire should be seen in the context of the general political trend of the time which since 1902 had been decidedly against the government. Buteshire was the fifteenth by-election gain by the Liberals from the Conservatives since 1902. The government, which had been in office since 1895, was widely seen as tired and divided and the Liberal opposition was united around key policies on free trade and education, as well as being sustained by a new approach to questions of social reform, the New Liberalism of thinkers such as Thomas Hill Green, Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and J A Hobson as well as by dynamic, radical politicians such as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill who had defected from the Tories in 1904.

K. Shand.Red Jacket Fire Station, 300 Block of Sixth Street, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-414, Kevin Hattington, 1975. Although the station was built by the village of Calumet (then \\"Red Jacket\\"), the lot on which it sits was leased from the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company until 1910, when the company deeded it to the village. The total cost of the building at the time was just over $20,000, including architectural work, stonework, and carpentry. In 1964, the fire department moved to the town hall building. The building was used in various ways, including rooms for summer repertory performers at the nearby Calumet Theatre. It now houses the Upper Peninsula Fire Fighters Memorial Museum.  Description  The Calumet Fire Station is a two-story Richardsonian Romanesque building, rectangular in plan and measuring fifty-four feet by eighty-three feet. It is constructed of red sandstone. Three fire engine entrances with wooden doors are in the center of the front facade. The doors are topped by a stepped gable which is flanked by a smaller gable on one side and an open bell tower with a pyramidal roof sits the other. The roof of the structure is flat. Small doors are in each of the other three sides. The building was originally constructed with the first floor housing fire engines and horses, with other equipment in the basement. The second floor primarily housed the fire fighters, but also held hay for the horses. The firemen's quarters included a bunk room, locker room, and a larger hall for social affairs.

They were originally built in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota, around 1890 and were moved to neighboring Stillwater in 2012 to make way for construction of the St. Croix Crossing bridge. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 for having local significance in the themes of industry and social history. They were nominated as a rare surviving embodiment of Minnesota's early Jewish immigrants and their frequent participation in the waste materials trade. History The owners, Moritz and Bertha Bergstein, settled in Oak Park Heights (then known as Oak Park) in 1890. They were in the business of recycling waste material. The shoddy mill, a rubble stone building, was used to recycle waste fabric into material to stuff mattresses. Moritz Bergstein was known as the \\"junk man\\" in Stillwater, and in addition to making mattresses he also operated a salvage business. He recycled waste paper, rags, scrap metal, and wood shavings, and he built a machine that tore up the rags. He employed several women to fabricate the mattresses. Later Bergstein entered into a partnership with his brother, Ignatz, to form a mattress-making firm. Although Moritz eventually discontinued making mattresses in Oak Park Heights, he continued to buy and sell waste materials, mostly scrap metal. When he died in 1923 he left behind \\"about 500 tons of iron and old junk\\", valued at about $3000. The Stillwater Daily Gazette called him \\"one of the best known men in Stillwater\\" and noted that he was \\"always honest and straight forward in his dealings.\\" There were few Jewish settlers in Minnesota in its pioneer days, so the story of the Bergsteins provides insight into early Jewish life in Minnesota. The Bergsteins emigrated from Europe in 1880, during a time when many Jews were emigrating from eastern Europe, but Moritz was born in Germany and Bertha was born in Bohemia. While many Jewish immigrants dealt in used goods and recycled materials, the Bergsteins were atypical because they lived in a town distant from other Jews, engaged in light manufacturing, owned property soon after they moved to Minnesota, and hired non-Jewish workers. Relocation The buildings in their original location in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota At the end of the 20th century the Bergstein Mill complex stood near the intersection of Minnesota State Highway 36 and State Highway 95, a location being eyed for a new bridge across the St. Croix River. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) acquired and removed 66 houses in 1996, but the lone holdout was the owner of the Bergstein property, who operated an auto repair business out of them. Mn/DOT funded a historical resource study which determined that the mill and warehouse were worth saving if a new location could be found. A new site at the south end of Stillwater with similar qualities to the old setting was agreed to in 2005. The Bergstein Mill and Warehouse were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. By the following year the buildings' owner had reached retirement age and accepted a new offer to vacate. Across the road the Bergsteins' original house, barn, and two outbuildings were demolished, while the two preserved buildings were moved in November 2012. The new site is being developed as Bridgeview Park, and an adjacent railroad track is slated to become part of a bicycle trail that will loop between Stillwater and the Wisconsin shore utilizing a pedestrianized Stillwater Lift Bridge. The city is still studying potential uses for the mill and warehouse, such as a bicycle repair shop, caf√©, kayak outfitter, or visitor center.

Its plot focuses on the silent film era and five pioneers of American cinema - actresses Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish, directors D. W. Griffith and Mack Sennett, and Paramount Pictures founder Adolph Zukor. Plot Programme from the 1980 West End production When Mary Gish and her daughters Lillian and Dorothy recognize their friend Gladys Smith in a film made by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, they search for her at the studio headquarters in New York City. There they discover she has been rechristened Mary Pickford and is known as the Biograph Girl. Before long Lillian and Dorothy are acting in films directed by D.W. Griffith, and when he decides to relocate to Hollywood, he brings the girls and their mother with him. Lillian is cast in Birth of a Nation, while Mary decides to leave Griffith in order to work for Adolph Zukor at a substantially higher salary. Eventually she finds herself forced to suppress her growing sophistication in order to maintain the image of innocence her fans have embraced. Shocked by the negative public and industry reaction to Birth of a Nation, Griffith vows to make an epic film advocating peace and tolerance. Intolerance proves to be an artistic success but a commercial flop. Griffith's financial woes threaten to end his career until Mary joins him, Charles Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks to form United Artists. When Griffith's monetary situation fails to improve, he urges Lillian to accept an offer from another studio, and she reluctantly does. With the arrival of sound films in 1927, the industry's pioneers are forced to re-evaluate their careers and make plans for the future.

Built for the Arran service, she spent her first 14 years there. Thereafter, she had a versatile career on the west coast of Scotland, lasting over 32 years, including providing cruises between 1977 and 1982. In 1989, she was sold for service on the Red Sea. She ran aground south of Jeddah and lay in a sunken condition from 2000. History MV Glen Sannox was built for the Arran route, replacing the pioneering \\"A B C ferries\\", which were struggling to keep up with the demand created by their own success. She bears the name of two of the most illustrious predecessors on that station. Launched on 30 April 1957, she ran trials on 27 June 1957 and took a VIP cruise the following day. After her maiden voyage on 29 June 1957, Greenock Fair Saturday, she spent a few more days receiving finishing touches at Gourock and took up the Arran route on 5 July.New Vessel in Service to Arram Railway Gazette 12 July 1957 page 59 Her introduction allowed retirement of Kildonan (the glorified 1933 puffer, originally Arran and the last of the Clyde and Campbeltown Shipping Co. fleet), Marchioness of Graham (the 1936 turbine, built primarily for the Arran service) and the 1937 . In June 1964, she became the first unit of the fleet to receive the lion Emblem on her funnel which is now a well-recognized symbol of the modern fleet. Glen Sannox was not fully roll-on/roll-off, it used a lift to get vehicles down to the car deck. This meant that loading and unloading the ship could be a time-consuming procedure when it was in heavy use in the summer, which meant it would sometimes run late. By 1969, when the Scottish Transport Group acquired the Caledonian Steam Packet Company, the Arran service was under serious pressure. Linkspans were installed at Ardrossan and Brodick in 1970 and Glen Sannox was replaced by . Soon after she had a stern ramp added. At the 1971-72 refit, the crane was removed, longer side-ramps were fitted and a bow thruster replaced her bow-rudder. Between October 1976 and March 1977, she underwent a further refit at Hall, Russell & Company, Aberdeen in preparation for a new cruising role. Two Norwegian-built, Wichmann diesel engines were installed, following favourable experience of these engines on the Norwegian built of 1974. Rated for a maximum of each at 415 rpm, they were of 7-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-charged type, and physically much smaller than her original Sulzers. As the original engines had been direct-reversing type, a gearbox was also required. The passenger spaces were gutted, with the tearoom converted into the \\"Tartan Bar\\" and a \\"teabar\\" installed in the forward lounge. The original bar, below the car deck, became a self-service cafeteria. Much new seating was fitted, with extensive redecoration. She served the company for over 32 years, and was superseded by full roll-on/roll-off ferries, the first of which on the Arran route was the . In July 1989, she was sold to Arab interests, renamed Knooz and registered in Panama. She left the James Watt Dock for the last time on 9 August 1989. She was massively rebuilt at Perama, Greece for further service on the Red Sea Muslim pilgrim-trade. She had various names, Nadia, Al Marwah and Al Basmalah 1 and is believed to have run aground on a reef south of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 2000. Layout Her appearance was strange in 1957, with forward superstructure and an open main deck at the stern with a 7-ton crane behind the hoist and side-ramps. The lift was required to get vehicles to the car deck. Below the car deck were a bar and crew cabins. On her upper deck were a combined tea-room and bar aft, seating sixty, with a lounge for 218, forward. The entrance hall, between lounge and tea-room, had the Caley lion emblazoned on the linoleum. There was open and semi-enclosed deck space on this upper deck and on the promenade deck, with an abundance of wooden sparred seats. The superstructure was topped by a tripod mainmast and a handsome, modern funnel. Forward on the promenade deck, below the bridge, was a spacious observation lounge and the clubhouse containing officers' quarters. There was also an exclusive lounge for Arran landlords, the house of Montrose. Glen Sannox was originally fitted with two Sulzer M diesel engines, built in Switzerland. Each was an 8-cylinder 2-stroke type of 2200 BHP at 360 rpm. She had a bow-rudder and a hydraulically powered hoist. The lift was very slow, especially when fully laden. During her life, a stern ramp was added to allow linkspan operation, the crane was removed and the side-ramps were remodelled as well as numerous changes of livery. Service MV Glen Sannox was the main ferry on the Ardrossan - Brodick - Fairlie Arran route for several years. On introduction, she increased the service from two daily return trips to four, lying overnight at Brodick and using Ardrossan as the principal mainland port. On Saturdays, until 1964 she was assisted, for passengers, by the Ayr excursion steamer, . MV Caledonia took over the Arran service on 29 May 1970, and Glen Sannox moved to Wemyss Bay. After two years, she moved again, to use the new linkspan at Gourock, until the arrival of the new in March 1974. She spent the 1974 season as the Oban - Craignure ferry, but was increasingly bothered with mechanical trouble, requiring a specially manufactured replacement piston. Back in the Clyde, she spent two years on contract between Wemyss Bay and the McAlpine oil-rig yard at Ardyne. Destined for Clyde cruising, in place of , she underwent a massive refit in 1976/77, but introduction was delayed by service needs. While awaiting a new ferry, for Rothesay, Glen Sannox took up the Wemyss Bay roster and inaugurated new linkspans there in May and June 1977. She returned to Mull for the 1977-78 winter, proving very popular. A varied programme of cruising was introduced in 1977: *Sundays - full down-the-water sails from Glasgow to the Kyles of Bute; moving to Gourock *Mondays - Tighnabruaich *Tuesdays - Loch Goil *Wednesdays - Arran *Thursdays - Round Bute *Fridays - Assorted outings *Saturdays - service as a car ferry, usually at Rothesay, with a non-return positioning cruise to Glasgow Changes were made in subsequent schedules, with Glasgow dropped in 1980. She continued to provide service at Brodick. Clyde cruising made a loss of ¬£232,000 in 1980. Poor weather and competition from were blamed. For 1981, Glen Sannox offered a programme of short weekday afternoon excursions between Rothesay, Largs, Brodick and Tighnabruaich, fitted between morning and evening service as the Gourock-Dunoon ferry and Saturdays as Brodick or Rothesay relief. In June/July, she also took MV Columbas duties from Oban, when both and were out of commission. CalMac abandoned Clyde cruising in 1982. Glen Sannox appeared on many of the CalMac's Clyde and West Highland routes, but never sailed to any of the Outer Hebrides, or even to Skye. Never fitted with stabilisers, she could be lively in exposed conditions. She spent her final summers as Clyde spare, with winters at Oban. Despite speculation about redeployment to Oban, she remained essential on the Clyde, as the only suitable alternative to the elderly .

Ireland On 12 July 2010, the High Court granted leave to Sinn F√©in Senator Pearse Doherty for a judicial review into why a by-election was not being held in Donegal South- West. The seat was vacant since June 2009, following the resignation of Fianna F√°il TD Pat \\"the Cope\\" Gallagher on his election to the European Parliament.

It was written, directed, edited and produced by Tony Stone who also plays one of the lead characters. The story is told in near-documentary film fashion, using only natural light, with an initial shaky camera technique that eventually slows down into smoother cinematography. It has very little dialog and a soundtrack featuring anachronistic heavy metal music. Though unrated, the film shows human-to-human violence, animal killing, defecation, and sex. It is a remake of the 1978 film The Norseman. The film received mixed reviews, with critics commenting on aspects of poor production quality and on Stone's innovative use of the camera. Plot Two Viking men are stranded in Newfoundland, Canada when their party of explorers loses a battle with Skraelings (indigenous peoples). The two men move northward, hoping to link up with an expedition led by Leif Ericson. They deal differently with the grim situation, one turning inward spiritually and the other reverting to a primal state, but both men are beset with memories of their earlier lives. Orn (Tony Stone) remembers his wife (Gaby Hoffmann), and Volnard (Fiore Tedesco) flashes back to his childhood home and his Christian sister (Clare Amory) who committed suicide after Volnard killed the man who converted her to Christianity. Traveling, they encounter two Irish monks who have escaped from another Viking party‚Äîone monk (Sean Dooley) is murdered at first, and a makeshift Christian church is burned down. The other monk (David Perry) joins the journey. The Viking men disagree about the monk and they separate. On his own, Orn meets a beautiful native Abenaki woman (Noelle Bailey) who drugs and rapes him. Volnard bonds with the surviving Christian monk who washes his feet. An Abenaki man trails Volnard, intending to kill him. Orn finds Volnard and the monk and kills the monk, enraging Volnard. The two Vikings fight, but spare each other. The next day, the Abenaki man kills Volnard and is then killed by Orn, who builds a funeral pyre for his dead countryman. The strange cold land ultimately prevails over Orn. Cast *Tony Stone as Orn *Fiore Tedesco as Volnard *Gaby Hoffmann as Orn's wife *Clare Amory as Volnard's sister *David Perry as an Irish monk *Sean Dooley as the second monk *Noelle Bailey as an Abenaki woman *Nathan Corbin as a Viking thrall *James Fuentes as an Abenaki man Theme The film's setting was inspired by the story of Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic explorer who followed Leif Ericson to Vinland (North America) hoping to establish a colony at the beginning of the 11th century. Production Establishing shots for Severed Ways were made in Maine and Newfoundland, including L'Anse aux Meadows, an early Viking encampment site. Most of the scenes of human interaction were filmed in rural Vermont over several years (ending in autumn 2006) on wooded land owned by Tony Stone's family. Stone, a resident of New York City, was familiar with this land from spending \\"three or four months a year\\" there in his youth. He wanted a location where he could do whatever he wished, free of big city limitations. He said, \\"I've always had this dichotomy between being super rural and super urban.\\" With very little budget but aiming for a \\"grand scale\\", Stone used two lightweight HD PRO digital video cameras for a sense of immediacy, capturing the action only in natural light. Stone said he employed shaky camera techniques at the beginning of the film to convey an off-balance feeling similar to that of the two main characters lost in a new land. As the story developed, Stone slowed the camera movements. He wished to give a sense that the natural environment would eventually close in over the lost men; to show the story \\"from the point of view of the trees and the woods\\". The film is unrated, having never been submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system for review. Stone is shown defecating in the film, and he slaughters and butchers a chicken. Scenes of brutal violence‚Äîmurder and rape‚Äîare part of the story. The characters speak very little in the film. The speech is subtitled in English on the film's theatrical print; the DVD offers English or Spanish subtitles. The English subtitles are in idiomatic Modern English, for instance, one of the characters says, \\"We're toast if we stay here.\\" Another piece of dialog, spoken during a meal, is \\"This fish is really killer.\\" The film also appropriates a scene from Quest for Fire in which a burning stick is tossed at wolves. Music The film's score, primarily heavy metal music of the black metal and death metal subgenres, consists of previously released tunes by Old Man's Child, Melissa Auf der Maur, Dimmu Borgir, Morbid Angel, Brian Eno, Judas Priest, Popol Vuh and Queens of the Stone Age. Stone chose anachronistic music that would reinforce \\"the belief system of these vikings ...the warrior spirit, the harshness, the visuals of battle, the pagan side.\\" Parts of two different songs by Burzum are played as the Vikings encounter a North American native. Varg Vikernes, whose solo musical project is known as Burzum, was convicted in 1994 of murdering √òystein Aarseth (aka Euronymous), a Norwegian musician and occasional business partner of Vikernes, and he was convicted of four counts of arson‚Äîburning down historic wooden Christian churches in Norway. Like Vikernes, Stone's film character Orn expresses distaste for Christianity and an unyielding faith in Odin and Thor. Release Severed Ways was shown on June 8, 2007, in the 43-seat Wilshire Screening Room as a competitor in the Los Angeles Film Festival. The film opened theatrically in New York City on March 13, 2009, at one theater: the Angelika Film Center. It remained open for two weeks, grossing $18,728 at the box office. It was released on DVD by Magnet Releasing and Magnolia Home Entertainment on July 28, 2009. The DVD offers subtitles in English or Spanish. Extra features include six minutes of two deleted scenes, ambient footage of nature and Newfoundland, and the church-burning scene. In Australia, the DVD was released with a Restricted MA15+ rating, warning those under 15 years of age against its \\"Strong themes and violence.\\" Netflix and Amazon offer the film as \\"Not Rated\\", but Walmart lists it as having an R rating. Critical response The film received mixed criticism. Regarding viewer reactions, Stone said, \\"It seems like a love or hate thing.\\" The New York Times noted Stone's adroit use of the beautiful natural scenery but criticized his lack of a \\"coherent tone\\" and described the grittier parts of the film as undermining \\"the moments of grandeur.\\" Stone was compared favorably to filmmaker Werner Herzog for some of the film but in other scenes \\"his characters are running around like costumed geeks at a comic-book convention.\\" Variety criticized the poor production, beginning with \\"still- breathing corpses‚Äîan early warning of the semi-amateur production values to come.\\" Variety ridiculed the slangy language of the subtitles: \\"really killer\\" and \\"we're toast\\". The magazine praised Stone for his ability \\"to disappear into the wilderness‚Äîand his character‚Äîwith minimal crew.\\" The Village Voice was sharply critical, saying Stone should have been stopped from making the film. The Voice wrote that \\"the spectacle of two dudes mucking about in the primal forest becomes tedious as Stone embraces a '70s dippiness\\". The Boston Globe wrote that the most of the scenes \\"look like a homemade educational reenactment\\", and that the film was \\"Part Werner Herzog wilderness trial, part epic music video, part religious commentary, part jest\\". Otherwise, the Globe praised Stone's competence, his \\"refreshingly open eye\\", and how the camera \\"swoops and lopes and circles.\\" See also *List of historical drama films Notes External links * Official website * Category:2007 films Category:2000s adventure drama films Category:2007 independent films Category:Films set in the Viking Age Category:Films set in the 11th century Category:Films set in Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Films set in pre- Columbian America Category:Films shot in Maine Category:Films shot in Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Films shot in Vermont Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Severed Ways"},{"id":"24632174","text":"\\"Precious Angel\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan that first appeared on his 1979 album Slow Train Coming. It was also released as a single in the Netherlands. \\"Precious Angel'\\" is a religious love song and is amongst the stronger songs he released during his \\"born-again Christian\\" period. Music critic Michael Gray considers it one of the standout tracks on Slow Train Coming. It has been included on a number of Bob Dylan compilation albums, including Dylan and Playlist: The Very Best of Bob Dylan '70s. It was included in most shows during Dylan's Gospel Tour in 1979 and 1980 but he has not played it in concert since then. It was also covered by World Wide Message Tribe on the 1998 album Heatseeker.  Composition  Musically, \\"Precious Angel\\" has a light reggae sound. Authors Oliver Keys and John Nogowski particularly praise the guitar playing of Mark Knopfler on the song.  Themes  At a concert in Seattle on January 14, 1980, Dylan claimed that the song is addressed to the woman who brought him to Christianity. This is consistent with the lyrics, particularly in the final verse where Dylan refers to his delivering angel as the torch that led him to the greater light of Jesus. The chorus might be addressed to either the precious angel or to Jesus: :Shine your light, shine your light on me :Ya know I couldn't make it by myself :I'm a little too blind to see The lyrics contain many biblical references. The theme of the song seems to be taken from 2 Corinthians 4:4 to 4:6, in which the light of Christ is contrasted with the darkness faced by those deluded by the devil. The line \\"Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down\\" appears to be a reflection of another verse from 2 Corinthians (10:3) which states \\"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh.\\" The line in the chorus about blindness appears to be influenced by a passage from the Gospel of John in which the blind man healed by Jesus proclaims that \\"Whereas I was blind, now I can see.\\" The opening line of the chorus may be taken from the Book of Isaiah 9:1, which states \\"The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelled in the land of the shadow of death, light has dawned.\\" It also recalls the chorus from Dylan's earlier song \\"I Shall Be Released.\\" in which Dylan sang about redemption through a \\"light come shining from the west down to the east.\\" A line from the song continues the theme of the previous song on Slow Train Coming, \\"Gotta Serve Somebody,\\" stating that \\"You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.\\" In an echo of earlier songs such as \\"Positively 4th Street,\\" Dylan later addresses his \\"so-called friends\\" who have \\"fallen under a spell\\" while thinking \\"all is well.\\" their cluelessness further echoing Mr. Jones from 1965's \\"Ballad of a Thin Man.\\" Dylan asks: :Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high :When men will beg God to kill them and they won‚Äôt be able to die? The notion of a fate worse than death has yet another biblical source, this time Book of Revelation 9:2 which states \\"In those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them.\\" The fourth verse of the song is directed at a \\"sister\\" who spoke of Buddha and Muhammad but not Jesus. Music critic Paul Williams suggests that this is a dig at Dylan's ex-wife Sara for keeping him from learning of Jesus sooner.  Identity of the woman  There has been much speculation over the exact identity of the precious angel the song is about. There are hints that she is black, particularly the phrase that he and the angel are \\"covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves,\\" referencing the slavery in Egypt of Dylan's Jewish ancestors and slavery of blacks in the United States before the American Civil War. Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin has suggested that the identity of the woman is Mary Alice Artes, who had been converted by the Vineyard Movement and subsequently helped Dylan on his path to Christianity, albeit after Dylan began the journey on his own.

Beginning in 1857, long before Henri Becquerel's famous serendipitous discovery of radioactivity in 1896, Ni√©pce de Saint-Victor observed that, even in complete darkness, certain salts could expose photographic emulsions.Rothman, Tony, Everything's Relative: And Other Fables from Science and Technology (New York, New York: Wiley, 2003) Chapter 5 \\"Invisible light: The discovery of radioactivity,\\" pages 46-52.

He soon realized that uranium salts were responsible for this anomalous phenomenon.Ni√©pce de Saint-Victor (1858) \\"Deuxi√®me m√©moire sur une nouvelle action de la lumi√®re\\" (Second memoir on a new action of light), Comptes rendus ‚Ä¶ , 46 : 448‚Äì452.

When one wants to experiment, one recovers it with a plate; one exposes it to the sun for about a quarter of an hour, one returns it to the dark; one treats it with a solution of silver nitrate, and one sees instantly appear a very strong positive image, ‚Ä¶ ) On p. 450, Niepce notes that if a solution of a uranium salt is used to paint a design on sheet of cardboard and if the cardboard is then pressed against a sheet that was treated with silver chloride, an image of the design will be reproduced in the silver chloride. On the same page, he states that if a sheet containing a design that was painted with a solution of a uranium salt is held near a sheet that was treated with silver chloride, \\" ‚Ä¶ il se reproduira √† 2 ou 3 centim√®tres de distance du papier sensible, ‚Ä¶ \\" (it [i.e., the design] will reproduce itself at 2‚Äì3 centimeters distance from the sensitive paper). (Photographers in France, England, and Germany soon confirmed Niepce's findings regarding uranium.See, for example: * Mr. Peligot showed, to the French Society of Photography, prints made from uranium nitrate by Mr. Victor Plumier in: Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie, 4 : 92 (1858).

Ni√©pce recognized that the \\"light\\" that was exposing his photographic plates was neither conventional phosphorescence nor fluorescence: the salts could expose photographic plates long after the salts had last been exposed to sunlight. Ni√©pce's superior, Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul, recognized the phenomenon as a fundamental discovery (\\"une d√©couverte capitale\\"), pointing out that uranium salts retained their power to expose photographic plates even after six months in the dark (\\"encore actif six mois apr√®s son insolation\\").M.E.

Indeed, in 1868, Edmond Becquerel published a book, La lumi√®re: ses causes et ses effets (Light: its causes and its effects), in which he mentioned Ni√©pce's findings; specifically, that objects that were coated with uranium nitrate could expose photographic plates in the dark.Edmond Becquerel, La lumi√®re: ses causes et ses effets (Paris, France: F.

Background She was born Anne Norton on 5 January 1576, one of ten children to Thomas and Margaret Norton of Hinxton, Cambridgeshire. Later, as her reputation came in question, rumours spread that she was an illegitimate child of the disreputable London apothecary and astrologer named Simon Forman. Also considered to be a \\"beautiful\\" woman, she married a physician, Dr. George Turner, who died in 1610, and became the mistress of Sir Arthur Mainwaring. At some point she had become a \\"waiting woman\\" or \\"companion\\" of Frances Howard. It seems that at this time that Howard had fallen in love with the king's favourite, Robert Carr and they soon began an exchange of romantic correspondence. Unfortunately for Howard she was married at the time to the Earl of Essex and at his instance was obliged to travel back with him after his return from France to his house at Chartley in Staffordshire. There she persisted in a stubborn refusal to sleep with her husband, thereby hoping no doubt to have the marriage annulled on the grounds on non-consummation. Whilst Carr may have been satisfied with this state of affairs, Frances wished to marry him. There was one person who stood in her way, Carr's mentor, Sir Thomas Overbury who disapproved of the match. Fortunately for Howard help was at hand both in her uncle, Sir Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton and in friend and ally Mrs Turner. The Overbury murder After Northampton had persuaded the king to have Overbury thrown in the Tower of London on trumped up charges, it was now Frances Howard's wish that he be murdered. Although a widow and outwardly respectable, Mrs Turner was in fact an independent businesswoman who ran her own \\"houses of ill-repute\\" at Paternoster Row and Hammersmith, where couples could indulge themselves together in secrecy. She was also running a lucrative monopoly in the supply of a saffron based starch which provided the yellow colouring to collars and ruffs which was then in vogue. Mrs Turner was therefore well connected with both the court and the less savoury sections of London society. She was thus able to put Howard in touch with Forman to provide love potions for Carr and a range of poisons, including arsenic, cantharidesSpanish fly and sublimate of mercury for Overbury from another apothecary named Franklin. These poisons were then included in a selection of \\"tarts\\" and \\"jellies\\" which were delivered to gaoler Richard Weston. They were then left with the Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir Gervase Helwys, before they were eaten by Overbury, who died as a result in September 1613. A few weeks later Howard's marriage was annulled and she was able to marry Carr. Trial and execution Two years later, after Overbury's murder came to light, Turner, Helwys and all the other accomplices in the crime were put on trial, the hearings being overseen by Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and the king's Attorney General, Sir Francis Bacon. With overwhelming evidence mounted against her, Turner confessed to her role in the crime. In passing sentence Chief Justice Coke referred to her as \\"a whore, a bawd, a sorcerer, a witch, a papist, a felon and a murderer\\". He also ordered her to be hanged in the fashionable starched ruffles she had invented \\"so that the same might end in shame and detestation.\\" Turner was hanged at Tyburn on 15 November 1615. Her hangman, not by coincidence, also wore \\"bands and cuffs of the same colour.\\" Yellow starch then went out of fashion.Sir Simon d'Ewes, vol. 1, p. 79\\"Notices of the historic persons buried in the chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula\\" by Doyne Courtenay Bell Turner reportedly left behind three illegitimate children she had with Mainwaring. In fiction Anne Turner is a character in Thomas Costain's 1942 historical novel For My Great Folly. Jean Plaidy's novel, The Murder In The Tower, published in 1964, mentions Anne Turner as one of the characters involved in the Overbury Murder. Anne Turner is mentioned in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter as an \\"especial friend\\" of Mistress Hibbins, a suspected witch. The novel mentions the yellow ruffs, which Turner had supposedly taught Hibbins how to make. Anne Turner is a character in the novel The King's Minion (also known as The Minion) by Rafael Sabatini, which is about the Overbury murder.

In 1583, Andrew Hoppringill carried out much improvement and extended the house as his family home. Further expansion took place in 1611, before Andrew returned to live at the family seat of Smailholm Tower in 1635, when his daughter, Jean, married Hugh Scott. A ceiling painting was rediscovered in 1952 celebrating that marriage. Hugh Scott, the new laird, carried out more improvements and extended the house. Further extensions were carried out in the 17th and 18th centuries, completing the edifice we see today. The five bay, U-shaped house is built of rubblestone and is embraced on three sides by gardens complete with water features. In 1872, Hugh Scott 9th of Gala commissioned David Bryce, an eminent Scottish architect, to design and build a new house. On completion the family moved to New Gala House, abandoning the old house. New Gala House was demolished in 1985 around the time the Scottish Borders Council renovated the old house and converted it to a venue. As well as being a museum and conference centre, the house plays a role in the graduation ceremonies of the local university and also caters for all forms of meetings including marriages.

A yellowish green mushroom with pink gills and spores, it is found in wet forests of Tasmania. Taxonomy First named as Leptonia rodwayi by British mycologist George Edward Massee in 1898, it was transferred to the genus Entoloma in a 1980 publication by German mycologist Egon Horak. It was named after Tasmanian botanist Leonard Rodway. The genus Entoloma is well represented in Australia, particularly Tasmania, and E. rodwayi is one of many unusually coloured members, others being shades of blue and purple as well as green. Description The cap is up to 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter, and is conical or convex, before flattening out as the mushroom ages. The centre is sometimes depressed. When dried, the mushroom transforms from yellow-green to a vivid blue-green. It can be confused with some other green mushrooms such as the larger and more solid Cortinarius austrovenetus and several species of Hygrocybe, which have slimy caps. It can also be distinguished by its pink gills; the edges of the gills are the same color as the sides. Viewed in deposit, such as with a spore print, the spores are pink; viewed microscopically, they are angular, with dimensions of 10 by 7 Œºm. Habitat and distribution Entoloma rodwayi is found in temperate rainforest and wet mixed forest, but is somewhat rare.

TST focuses on the child's emotional and behavioral needs as well as the environments where the child lives (home, school, community). The treatment model includes four components (skill-based psychotherapy, home and community based care, advocacy, and psychopharmacology) that are fully described in a published manual. A clinical trial showed that TST is effective in improving the mental health and well-being of children who have been traumatized. TST has also been successfully replicated. Trauma Systems Therapy treatment is not just for the victims. It also educates the victims significant others in order for them to support the victims in their recovery and help them control their emotions during future stressful events. When referring to TST, therapists are looking at four categories: the reason a child may need TST, the signs and symptoms expressed by the child, the management and treatment methods and the results of children who have gone through TST. A look at what causes emotional trauma, the families involved, and how therapy can heal the child as well as the adult are also important factors. Reasons for Treatment Traumatic events that affect children are seen in households where sexual, mental, or physical abuse is present. The inability to regulate self-emotions either directly or indirectly is a clinical sign that a traumatic event has affected the child. According to child psychiatrist Dr. Glenn Saxe, ‚ÄúTST is a comprehensive model for treating traumatic stress in children and adolescents that adds to individually based approaches by specifically addressing the child‚Äôs social environment and/or systems of care‚Äù. This may include children or adolescents having social problems in school or in their home secondary to rape, physical abuse, neglect, death of a caregiver and/or any significant life altering emotion trauma. Sexual, physical, or mental traumatic events can affect present, past memory, and the anticipated future. Saxe's theory in ‚ÄúThe March of the Moments: Traumatic Stress in the Past, Present, and Future,‚Äù begins with ‚Äúsurvival-in-the-moment‚Äù which causes severe emotions, unexplained personality changes, erratic behavior due to a sudden trigger that reminds the child of the event. Second, ‚ÄúPast memory‚Äù refers to ‚Äúlaying down of the present, conscious moments in the brain so that they can be accessible if we need them‚Äù. This causes significant long-term trauma because if a child is not able to understand what has happened to him or her in the past, then he or she will go through life with a band-aid on this wound instead of healing mentally and physically. Finally, ‚Äúmarching into the future‚Äù refers to one of the most detrimental causes of traumatic stress, its effect on the child's ability to think into the future. Saxe states, ‚ÄúIf consciousness is about the present, and memory is about the past, then planning and anticipation are about the future‚Äù. One's ability to see into the future is part of the human cognition, when a child starts to ‚Äúcalculate survival-related risk‚Äù; this causes significant stress by continuously reliving the trauma. When a child or adolescent plans their future around what might happen, this never allows the cause of the problem to be resolved, insuring they will never mentally or emotional heal. In addition to the black and white causes of Traumatic Stress, there are also secondary causes that are directly related to these events. So TST not only addresses the event at hand but also the associated problems that come along with it. Diagnosis/ Signs and Symptoms The treatment for TST is based on professional finding. PTSD is an umbrella diagnosis that includes many children and adolescents who show the basic problem of the inability to regulate their emotions. When evaluating a child for TST, therapists look for awareness, affects, and actions when faced with a stressful event or unfamiliar situation. Children who have been exposed to traumatic events show secondary symptoms such as the following: self modulation, self-destructive behavior, disassociation, feeling shameful, sadness, anger, hostility, social withdrawal, poor relationship skills, or changes in personality. In many children, these symptoms can show up long after the event has occurred, during puberty or even the transition into adulthood. There are three main groups used to categorize a child's trauma, starting with Awareness (elements of attention, sense of self, orientation); Affect (mood disorders, personality disorders); and Action (conduct disorders, personality, mood disorders, eating disorders, or substance abuse). The disorders listed are usually first seen by family members, teachers, counselors, or other adults in the child's life. Children who show signs of depression may also be affected by some sort of PTSD and would benefit from TST. Once children are clinically depressed, they tend to show changes in their thinking about themselves, their view of the world and how they see the future. We see the signs and symptom associated with the event spill over into the home life, social life, academics and extracurricular activities. Unfortunately, children haven't learned coping skills to deal with traumatic events. Instead, they act out or start the downward spiral to self-destruction. Understanding what to look for and recognizing this behavior in a child or adolescent is key to early detection and success. Management Management of such intense emotional stress has to include the child affected, as well as his or her social surroundings. TST treats the home and proved community based care, provides a service advocacy, helps with emotional regulation skills training and uses psychopharmacology to treat patients. Knowledge of the child's trauma, what stage he or she is at in the recovery phase, and willingness to seek treatment is all part of the healing process for the child and his or her family. Therapy starts with the home environment. The caregiver has to understand the core problem by addressing if his or her child is sad a lot, destructive, or maybe the school keeps calling CPS (child protective services). Understanding why the child is acting in such a manner is crucial in the healing process. Treatment for family, teachers and social workers is done so all the adults are on the same page with the problem at hand; they understand the course for treatment and can all be tools for the child to use during TST. Next, everyone in the child's life must become a service advocacy, which means holding ‚ÄúFamily Collaborative Meetings‚Äù. This offers education and information to the adults so they know what to expect from TST. Dedication from the adults to meet at the scheduled times, have adequate transportation to therapy, ability to overcome language barriers, and put their children's needs before their own are all essential to success. Emotional regulation skills training is very important to therapy. The process starts with assessment, and then going through the course of treatment. Coping skills are stable and healthy ways to overcome stress and manage a child's emotions and emotional identification, giving the child tools so he or she can better deal with the strategies, and communication about feelings, emotions, fears and concerns. This is especially important as children who experience trauma face a loss of emotional and mental control because of emotional numbing, flashbacks, and a higher probability for many mental health issues. An example of a coping technique that could be used is therapy through creating music. Music helps stimulate feel-good hormones in the brain, and could help re-establish a sense of balance and mental tranquility. Finally, psychopharmacology is medication used to help a person's emotional state. To reach the best therapeutic effect for a child, all of these concepts have to be integrated. The medication approach starts with SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors); these help with anxiety, depression and impulsivity. The second-line medications are Benzodiazepines, Tricyclic antidepressants and Antipsychotic medication. These are very strong and are used as a last-ditch effort to prevent a child from having severe emotional problems. Occasionally, sleeping medication is prescribed but all are under careful supervision for harmful side effects. TST is an ongoing process that attempts to heal the child, not band-aid the problem; thus, medication is used sparingly and patients are weaned to lower therapeutic doses over time. Results TST patients showed a much longer committed enrollment time versus the patient in basic therapy by almost 90%. The key to success is preventing dropout; this is a long process and significant evidence-based treatment needs at least eight sessions. Children with emotional trauma tend to come from substance abuse families and lower income. This makes it hard for parents to be committed to TST, particularly if they struggle with addiction or abuse themselves. Children have shown significant progress just by the one-on-one attention during TST; a child's social environment is crucial to his or her success in treatment. Results vary in different social levels of the country, different families and what each child has experienced and its severity.

Described as new to science in 2007, it is found in Tasmania, where it fruits on the ground of wet sclerophyll forests in late spring to early winter (usually between January and March). The fruit bodies (mushrooms) have reddish-purple caps measuring up to in diameter supported by whitish stipes measuring long by thick. On the cap underside, the crowded gills are initially white before turning pink as the spores mature. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 2007 by Australian mycologist Genevieve Gates and Dutch mycologist Machiel Noordeloos, from collections made in Tasmania, Australia. The specific epithet austroprunicolor is derived from the Latin prefix austro-, meaning \\"southern\\", and the Latin word prunicolor, meaning \\"plum-coloured\\". The type collection was made in January 2002 at Kermandie Falls, near Geeveston in southern Tasmania. The species was discovered as a result of intensive field research, conducted by Gates and David Ratkowsky, which began in 1998. Realizing that many Tasmanian Entolomataceae species were undescribed, they and their collaborators published a series of papers documenting the new fungi. Within the genus Entoloma, the fungus is classified in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant granules of pigment. Noordeloos and Gates place it in the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous pink or blue cap that contrasts with a pallid, whitish, polished stipe. Description The cap measures 1 to 5 cm (0.4‚Äì2 in) in diameter, and is convex or umbonate (having a central rounded elevation resembling a nipple). It is bluish-purple when young before reddening to a reddish-purple and eventually fading to a more purplish-grey colour. The cap surface texture is initially fibrillose (made of loose fibers) to velutinous (made of short, fine \\"hairs\\" that form a velvety surface), and then breaks up into small radially arranged fibrillose squamules (small scales) as it matures. The cap margin curves downward. Gills are closely crowded together, up to 6 mm broad, and have an adnate attachment to the stipe. They are white initially before becoming tinged with pink from the developing spores. The thin cylindrical stipe measures long and wide with a slightly thicker base. It is dry and brittle, hollow, and white or nearly white. The flesh is purple in the cap, and white in the stipe. The smell and taste are indistinct, although the latter has been described as peppery or radish-like. Its edibility is unknown. The spore print is pink, and the spores measure 10‚Äì13 by 6‚Äì9 Œºm. They are heterodiametric (with different diameters in different directions), possessing between 6 and 8 pronounced angles. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- spored, lack clamps, and measure 33‚Äì40 by 9‚Äì14 Œºm. Located on the gill edge, the thin-walled, inconspicuous cheilocystidia measure 20‚Äì30 by 5‚Äì9 Œºm and have shapes ranging from irregular cylinders to narrow clubs to flasks. The cap cuticle is arranged in the form of a cutis (with bent-over hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, perpendicular to the cap surface), comprising cylindrical to inflated hyphae that are up to 20 Œºm wide. The cap tissue is made of narrow cylindrical hyphae that are 4.5‚Äì9 Œºm in diameter. They contain granules that have a purple-brown pigment. The stipe cuticle is made of loosely arranged, cylindrical hyphae measuring 2‚Äì7 Œºm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae. Similar species Entoloma queletii Entoloma austroprunicolor resembles the European species E. queletii, but the cap of the latter species fades to an ochre colour, and it has a white fibrillose stipe. Microscopically, its gill edges have well-differentiated cheilocystidia. Habitat and distribution Entoloma austroprunicolor is a commonly occurring mushroom of wet sclerophyll forests in Tasmania. Fruiting occurs from late spring to early winter, with most fruit bodies recorded between the months of January to March. In a study of the distribution of mushroom species in this area, it was found to occur only in mature or uncut forests.

The Cambridge University Catholic Chaplaincy, known as Fisher House after its patron, English martyr and Cambridge chancellor St John Fisher, is the Catholic chaplaincy for members of the University of Cambridge in England. Founded in 1896, it is now located on the site of a former inn on Guildhall Street in the centre of Cambridge. From September 2013, the chaplain is Mgr Mark Langham (a priest of the Archdiocese of Westminster and former Administrator of Westminster Cathedral); the assistant chaplains are Sr Ann Swailes OP and Fr Chase Pepper CSC. Operation Garden of Fisher House from the upper floor of the Central Library Plaque by the entrance The chaplaincy is open to all Catholic members of the University, from undergraduates to fellows. Approximately 500 people attend the three Sunday Masses (a said English vigil Mass, sung Latin Mass and sung English Mass), with 20‚Äì30 people attending daily. During the exam period, Lauds is also celebrated. The finances of the chaplaincy, including building upkeep, are handled by the Cambridge University Catholic Association (CUCA), while the chaplains are appointed by the Oxford and Cambridge Catholic Education Board (OCCEB). Day-to-day running of the chaplaincy is handled by the chaplain and the student-run Fisher Society. Regular events include the annual Fisher Mass (in recent years celebrated at Great St Mary's) and the Gilbey requiem (at Trinity College), as well as the Fisher Society dinner, barbecue, and garden party at the nearby Dominican priory. Lunches are organised daily (excepting Sundays when tea is provided), as well as many parties and events throughout the term. The chaplaincy provides weekly courses and discussion groups on bible study, theology, ethics, poetry, philosophy and others, as well as an annual series of Fisher Lectures. History The chaplaincy borrows the arms of its patron, St John Fisher. Foundation and Early Years (1871-1924) Oxford and Cambridge universities opened their doors to Catholics in 1871 after the repeal of the Test Acts. However, the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith had decreed that it would be next to impossible for the ancient English universities to be frequented without mortal sin, stressing the dangers of an increasing atmosphere of liberalism and scepticism. This decision was met with public outcry from the wealthy laity, who wished for their sons to attend Oxbridge colleges. After a petition led by the Catholic Cambridge fellow Baron Anatole von H√ºgel, this ban was lifted in 1895 with the condition that a chaplaincy be established to provide teaching on philosophy, history and religion. As a result of this, the Universities Catholic Education Board (later OCCEB) was founded and Fr Edmund Nolan was appointed chaplain. At the same time, the Fisher Society was founded by Cambridge students as a literary and debating society. Henry Fitzalan- Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk purchased property in Cambridge and the chaplaincy was established there at St Edmund's House in November 1886. The very first lectures were given by Cuthbert Butler, OSB, entitled \\"Questions of the Day\\". In 1899, CUCA was founded in order to purchase rooms for the chaplaincy at 2 Green Street. From here, the chaplaincy would then move to Llandaff House, near Downing College, under Monsignor Arthur Barnes. After a brief closure during the war, Fr Bernard Marshall became chaplain at 50 Bridge Street, and then 2 Round Church Street, next to the Union. Fisher House (1924-present) Cimabue's crucifix. In 1924, a Grade II listed pub called the Black Swan was purchased by CUCA for ¬£10,000. The chaplaincy was moved there and named Fisher House. An interesting cluster of buildings, two old houses, joined at right angles to each other. One (housing library incl. student bar and kitchen, studies) overhangs the street and is 16th century. The other (housing dining room, kitchens, great chamber, living quarters) is reached via alleyways and is early 17th century with medieval cellars. The Great Chamber on the first floor, well lit with oak beams and antique furniture, paintings and tapestry, is one of the most pleasant rooms in Cambridge. In 1998, Alfred Gilbey, a previous chaplain who had worked to prevent Fisher House being demolished for development, was interred in the courtyard. Fisher House was officially opened on 4 May 1925, the then feast of Blessed John Fisher. In 1937 the women's chaplaincy was founded at Lady Margaret House, but was not merged into Fisher House until 1966. Originally Mass was held in a chapel in an upper room, but in 1967 work was started on a new hall and side chapel. The hall was originally rented out to market traders to provide income, but in 2008, after a successful appeal to raise ¬£2 million, it became a permanent place of worship. This endowment fund included a personal donation of ‚Ç¨3000 from Pope Benedict XVI, who had previously visited Fisher House to give a lecture in 1988 as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. In 2005, a reconstruction of a Cimabue crucifix was commissioned from the Hamilton Kerr Institute by the then chaplain, Fr Alban McCoy. This 2 m artwork was constructed according to contemporary medieval Italian methods, in particular those documented in Cennino Cennini‚Äôs work Libro dell‚ÄôArte. The crucifix was completed in March 2008, installed at Fisher House and consecrated by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor.

Born in Monroe, South Carolina, Hatchett was the son of a United Methodist minister. In December 1946‚Äîwhile studying at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina‚Äîhe received his Episcopalian confirmation. He went from Wofford College to the University of the South, where he graduated from in 1951 with a Bachelor of Divinity. He was ordained deacon in the Diocese of Upper South Carolina in 1951, and then a priest in 1952. He served as a curate at the Church of the Advent, Spartanburg; deacon-in-charge of Incarnation, Gaffney, and Atonement, Blacksburg. Thereafter he took on the role of St. Peter's, Charleston's rector, where he also served as chaplain to The Citadel. Desiring to further his education, he moved from Charlestown back to Sewanee, Tennessee in 1965 in order to pursue a Master of Sacred Theology, which he received in 1967. In 1969 he began serving on the faculty of The School of Theology of the University of the South. While serving there he did work on his doctoral studies through General Theological Seminary, receiving a Doctor of Theology in 1972. In the early 1970s‚Äîas work on the proposed \\"new Prayer Book\\" was underway‚ÄîHatchett's work (along with that of Massey Shepherd) deeply shaped the final version. In 1973, he was appointed to the Episcopal Church's Standing Commission on Church Music, serving as the chairperson of that text committee for The Hymnal 1982. In 1976, Hatchett was appointed a member of the Standing Liturgical Commission. He served as chairman of the committee which produced The Book of Occasional Services, 1979 as well as a member of the Episcopal Church's General Board of Examining Chaplains (1988‚Äì1994). After publication of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, Hatchett authored the exhaustive Commentary on the American Prayer Book (1981), still the definitive resource on the history and theology of the Episcopal Church's current Prayer Book. He is also the author of Sancitfying Life, Time and Space: An Introduction to Liturgical Study (1976), A Manual for Clergy and Church Musicians (1980), The Making of the First American Book of Common Prayer (1982), and several journal articles. In addition to his work with the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, Hymnal 1982 and Book of Occasional Services, he taught liturgical and church music at The School of Theology of the University of the South from February 1, 1969, until his retirement on May 16, 1999. On January 15, 1991, he was named the Cleveland Keith Benedict Professor of Pastoral Theology. Believing a seminary education involved more than information, Hatchett was known for opening his home to students throughout his 30 years as a professor. Even after his retirement he remained in Sewanee, playing an active role at The School of Theology, continuing to teach at an adjunct level and open his home to students. When the current professor of liturgy at The School of Theology went on sabbatical in the first semester of the 2007‚Äì2008 academic year, Hatchett, then 80 years old, returned to teach the senior liturgy course to another generation of priests. In 2008 General Theological Seminary awarded him their distinguished alumni award. The same year the School of Theology awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity. Hatchett died of natural causes at Emerald-Hodgson Hospital in Sewanee, Tennessee in August 2009.

The scale of the pattern can be selected to range from several nanometers to micrometres. The pattern can be produced on any arbitrary magnetic film or interface and hence the method is applicable to metal multi-layers produced using ultra high vacuum or MBE. The use of this method to produce a working Giant Magneto Resistance device is demonstrated. Developers: Richard J.

Reported as a new species in 1995, it is known predominantly from Southern Australia. The saprobic fungus produces mushrooms that grow on well-decayed wood, often on the underside of wood lying in litter. The dark chestnut-coloured caps are covered with white, easily removed scales, and reach diameters of up to wide. The pale, slender stems are up to long and have white scales at the base. On the underside of the cap, the cream-coloured gills are widely spaced and bluntly attached to the stem. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown. Taxonomy, naming, and classification The species was first discovered in 1992 in Kuitpo Forest, South Australia, and reported as new to science in a 1995 Australian Systematic Botany publication. The species name refers to the nargan or nargun, a mythical aboriginal being ‚Äì originally the mycologists Tom May and Bruce Fuhrer had called it \\"nargan\\", as its white speckles glistened in the dark like the eyes of the nargan, and Cheryl Grgurinovic incorporated this into its specific epithet. It is commonly known as \\"Nargan's bonnet\\", but has also been referred to as the \\"spotted pixie cap\\". With respect to infrageneric classification (i.e., taxonomic ranking below the level of genus) in Mycena, several characteristics suggest the mushroom fits best in Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus' section Fragilipedes: the ellipsoidal, amyloid spores; dextrinoid spore-bearing tissue; smooth cheilocystidia; gills with the edge the same colour as the face; and the non- slimy, distinctly coloured cap. According to the 1986 infrageneric classification proposed by Rolf Singer, the mushroom would be classified in subgenus Mycena, subsection Ciliatae, stirps Alcalina (roughly equivalent to section Fragilipedes of Maas Geesteranus) because of the amyloid spores, smooth, elongated cheilocystidia, dull-coloured pigment, and stem without either latex or a slimy sheath. Grgurinovic erected the new section Nargan to accommodate M. nargan, because its scales, lack of coarse fibrils at the base of the stem, and lack of pruinose coating meant it was not a good fit for section Fragilipedes. Description Young specimens have white scales covering the cap and base of the stem. The caps of young mushrooms are initially egg-shaped to conical, expanding to become bell-shaped and up to 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter. Initially, the margin of the cap is rolled inwards; it typically assumes a lighter color than the centre of the cap surface. Dark brown in color, the mushroom is distinguished by the presence of white speckles or scales on the cap and stem; these scales may disappear when they become sloughed off or washed away by rain, which can make the species hard to recognise. The thick gills have an adnate attachment to the stem (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem), and are white to light grey in colour, paler toward the edge. There are about 24‚Äì28 gills extending completely from the cap margin to the stem, and one or two tiers of lamellulae (shorter gills does do not extend fully from the margin to the stem). The thin stem is up to 4 cm (1.6 in) high and 0.3 cm (0.12 in) wide, and does not have a ring. Young specimens will typically have whitish scales at the base; later, these will slough off and a felt-like whitish mycelium may be apparent. The mushroom have no distinctive odour. The spore print is white or cream. The edibility of the mushroom has not been reported. Microscopic characteristics The spores of M. nargan are roughly ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline, and measure 7.4‚Äì10.4 by 4.8‚Äì7.1 Œºm. They have a small, oblique apiculus, and lack oil droplets. In terms of staining reactions, they are acyanophilous (not absorbing methyl blue dye), and amyloid (turning blue-black in Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, have clamp connections at their bases, and measure 29.6‚Äì36.4 by 8.2‚Äì10.7 Œºm. They are four-spored, and the spores are attached to the basidia by long slender sterigmata that are up to 7.2 Œºm long. The gill edge is sterile (without basidia), and has abundant cystidia. These thin-walled cheilocystidia range in shape from swollen in the middle with a beak-like point, to spindle-shaped (fusiform) to club-shaped. They are smooth, hyaline, and inamyloid, with dimensions of 20.8‚Äì38.4 by 4.8‚Äì10.4 Œºm. They have a clamp connection at base. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not present in this species. The gill tissue is made of smooth, thin-walled cylindrical to egg-shaped cells, up to 30.4 Œºm in diameter. The cells are dextrinoid (producing a black to blue-black positive reaction with Melzer's reagent), and reddish brown. The surface of the cap (the pileipellis) is made of a layer of bent-over filamentous hyphae measuring 1.8‚Äì4.8 Œºm. These loosely arranged hyphae are slightly gelatinised, smooth, thin-walled, hyaline, inamyloid, and have clamp connections. The tissue layer directly under the pileipellis (the hypodermium) has cells containing brown pigment. The cap tissue consists of smooth, thin-walled, cylindrical to broadly cylindrical or ovoid cells, up to 37.0 Œºm in diameter, with clamp connections. These cells are dextrinoid and reddish orange-brown in colour. The surface of the stem is made of filamentous hyphae, 2.2‚Äì4.0 Œºm in diameter, either smooth or with sparse to moderately dense short, rod-like to cylindrical projections. The cells are thin-walled to very slightly thick- walled, hyaline, inamyloid, and have clamp connections. Caulocystidia (cystidia on the cap surface) are not present. The stem tissue consists of short, cylindrical cells, up to 28.0 Œºm in diameter that are smooth, thin- walled, and with or without brown pigment in the cytoplasm. The cells contain clamp connections and are reddish orange-brown. Similar species Mycena nargan has a very distinct appearance, and is unlikely to be mistaken for other Mycenas. However, one noted unintentional misidentification occurred when the M. nargan on the cover photograph of Bruce A. Fuhrer's 2005 book A Field Guide to Australian Fungi was labelled as Mycena nivalis, a species with a white cap. Habitat and distribution A common mushroom, Mycena nargan is found growing singly or in clusters on the underside of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is much more likely to be found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.

The county takes its name from the shape of the mountain range in this region, which resembles a phoenix spreading its wings. The county is situated on a variety of geological formations, including karst, which is a landscape formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks‚Äîincluding limestone, dolomite and gypsum‚Äîand is characterized by sinkholes, caves and underground drainage systems. Karst is a rare formation seen in only a few locations worldwide. Geographic features Fengshan County lies on the eastern fringe of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and the terrain follows a northwest to southeast direction. 70% of the area, , is covered by karst and arable land. The area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average yearly temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. Mineral resources Fengshan County possesses mineral resources such as gold, pyrite, sulphur, limonite and copper. The pyrite reserves are estimated to be about 7,083 tons with an average grade of 17%. Karst resources Fengshan has been described as the \\"kingdom of karst and the city of caves.\\" There are more than 20 karst land formations such as huge caves, underground rivers, depressions, karst poljes, and sinkholes. According to statistics, there are 50 caves with chambers having an area of more than 2000 square meters and 19 caves with chambers that have an area that exceeds 10,000 square meters. The largest caves are the Jiangzhou Underground Corridor, Mawangdong Cave and Gatundong Cave. Jiangzhou Underground Corridor consists of many smaller caves, shafts and underground rivers. The corridor is and has an average slope gradient of 9¬∞. The cave was developed in the Permian Period. Jiangzhou Underground Corridor is rich in curly crystals, vast sparkling terraces, and colossal stalactites and stalagmites. It has 25 caverns, each having an area of between 4000-18500 square meters. Landforms  Mawangdong Cave Mawangdong Cave (, ) consists of three layers. The upper and middle layers are dry with a length, height and width of , and respectively. The lower layer is an underground river channel. The cave's entrance is above the foothills and its mouth measures 94√ó138 m. A karst sinkhole known as a \\"Tiankeng\\" lies at the southern section of the cave. Its mouth has a tri-corner shape with rounded corners measuring 225 m√ó180 m. The depth of this sinkhole is and an accumulation of collapsed rocks and clay lies at the bottom of the sinkhole. The vegetation there is verdurous. The cave is named \\"Mawangdong\\", which literally means \\"Horse King Cave\\", since the cave entrance resembles a horse's mouth.http://www.naturalarches.org/files/LeyeFengshanGeoparkChina.pdf This cave is a neighbor to Sanmenhai Cave (, ) and the two are connected by an underground river. Xixili Cave Xixili Cave is long and has three layers. The two upper layers each have a chamber with an area of and , respectively. This cave contains flowstones, cave flags, hanging curtains, and cave crystals. Jiangzhou Natural Bridge Jiangzhou Natural Bridge is a karst formation spanning around , ¬±, and connecting the two mountains. Its height is , with an arch height of and width of . It is located about east of the township of Jiangzhou in Guangxi, which is about south of Fengshan. Yuanyang Springs In the name \\"Yuan-yang\\" (), the words yuan and yang stand for male and female Mandarin Ducks, respectively. In symbolic representations, Mandarin Ducks always appear as a male and female pair and are seen to represent fidelity. The Yuanyang Springs consist of two springs; the water of each spring has a distinctive color: one is a clear green, the other is turbid blue. Chemical analysis of their waters has shown that the composition is the same. The springs are approximately the same size. The surface pool is a rounded three-corner shape with a baseline of 21 meters and height of 30 meters. At certain times of the year, the water backflows. Peak-cluster depressions The term \\"Karst Fengcong\\" or karst peak cluster is a term created by Chinese scholars to classify karst by the hill or peak density. The term \\"Peak-cluster depression\\" describes the land form that combines peak-clusters and closed depressions, which are the two basic features of Fengcong. The beauty of Fengshan's sublime, unique, and precipitous valleys is created by towering, imposing peaks and low-lying depressions.

Geography  The mountain is located close to the main chain of the Alps where it marks the Dora-Durance water divide, on the eastern side of it. The Col du Chaberton (2.674 m) connects the Cahberton with the Pointe Rochers Charniers and the main ridge. Chaberton is in the municipality of Montgen√®vre in the Brian√ßonnais region. It is easily recognisable by its pyramidal shape and flat top.  History  Ruined artillery batteries with people sitting on top of turret #4 of a total of 8 Drone view of the 8 artillery batteries ruins in 2018 Until 1947 Mont Chaberton was in Italy, located in the municipality of Cesana Torinese. In 1883 Italy joined the Triple Alliance and started strengthening its defences against France. Between 1898 and 1910 Italian troops built an artillery battery on the summit that pointed towards France, in particular at the town of Brian√ßon, and the pass to Italy over the Col de Montgen√®vre. A road was built to the summit from the village of F√©nils in the Susa Valley by soldiers and engineers led by Major Engineer Luigi Pollari Maglietta. They flattened the summit by about 6 metres to provide a surface for the eight towers. Their height of 12 metres was designed to overcome the highest snowfall recorded. Each emplacement was manned by seven men, who were protected by a relatively lightly armoured dome because the battery was thought to be out of reach of conventional artillery. Eight 149mm guns were mounted in the individual masonry towers. The fort was dubbed the \\"Fort of the Clouds\\" because it was often hidden in the clouds. During the First World War, when Italy entered the war alongside the Triple Entente, the guns were removed to be used on the front against the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under the Benito Mussolini's regime, Chaberton was rearmed again to threaten Brian√ßon. In 1940, the garrison had about 340 men under the command of Captain Spartaco Bevilacqua. The French army installed four 280mm mortars dating back to the battle of Verdun in the First World War, divided into two batteries and camouflaged: one on Eyrette, the other at Po√´t Morand below Fort de l'. Both sites were outside the view of the Italians. These two sections manned by the 6th Battery of the 154th R√©giment d'Artillerie de Position (154th RAP). Because of the altitude of the mortars and their target, special artillery tables had to be calculated. When Italy entered the Second World War, they bombarded the French positions around Brian√ßon on 20 June, but Italian troops did not advance. Little damage was inflicted. Because of cloud on the peak, the French could not respond. On 21 June 1940 the 154th Artillery Regiment destroyed six of the eight turrets using their mortars. They were guided by observers on the nearby Mont Janus. Nine Italians were killed and 50 were wounded. Turrets 7 and 8 continued to fire over the next three days, until the cease-fire of 24 June 1940. The fort was abandoned 8 September 1943. It was briefly re-occupied in autumn 1944 by paratroopers of the Italian Social Republic. At the end of the war France acquired the mountain, and the border was moved to the edge of the Italian village of Claviere. In 1957 all the remains of the guns and armour were removed. The masonry that supported the turrets is still visible. The remaining underground structures are in a dangerous condition.  Geology  The portion closest to the peak is composed of white and yellowish dolomite dating back to the upper Late Triassic ; moving away from the summit there are formations of limestone and compact dolomite and grey limestone shale, limestone of the Jurassic in a structure syncline. On the ridge between the summit and the nearby are outcrops of mica schist with quartz, crystalline limestones and porphyritic rocks.

The first three branches (Chashan Ëå∂Â±±, Ao Âù≥, Hualan Ëä±Ëìù) were considered the owners of the lands, as the dates of their first arrivals are estimated at around 1,000 years ago. They lived in settled villages and enjoyed some economic stability. The Pan Áõò and Shanzi Â±±Â≠ê are more recent arrivals, and they lived as tenants of the other established Yao people, living a nomadic life that did not allow them to accumulate many material possessions.

It was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Center City became the county seat of Chisago County in the 1870s, during a time of Swedish migration and settlement in the county. The buildings in the historic district include the Chisago Lake Evangelical Lutheran Church, which was the main Swedish Lutheran parish in the area, as well as a number of residences built between 1888 and 1910. The homes have moderate ornamentation and attention to architectural styling details of their period. The Center City Historic District is significant as a link to the Swedish Lutheran population of the Chisago Lakes region during the area's most important period of development and as the county's finest concentration of late nineteenth and early twentieth century residences. When the railroad arrived in the Chisago Lakes region in 1881, the area witnessed significant growth. The residences within the Center City Historic District, housed merchants, tradesmen, professionals, politicians, and retired farmers. They are reflective of the growing prosperity of the region. The Chisago Lake Evangelical Lutheran Church is the second-oldest Lutheran congregation in Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by Eric Norelius, who founded several other Lutheran churches in Minnesota. Norelius was a divinity student and served for three months before returning to the seminary. A permanent pastor arrived in 1855, and a wood- frame church was built in 1856. A brick church was built in 1881‚Äì1883, but it was struck by lightning and burned in 1888. The congregation rebuilt the church immediately, using the masonry contractors as before. The bell was installed in the steeple in 1890, and a clock was installed in 1907.

Silverman is an American entrepreneur and private equity investor. Silverman is best known for his role in building Cendant Corporation into a multibillion-dollar business services company that provided car rentals, travel reservation services as well as real estate brokerage services and was also the largest franchisor of hotels globally. Among the brands that Silverman controlled included hotels and motels such as AmeriHost Inn, Days Inn, Howard Johnson's, Ramada, Super 8 and Travelodge; car rental operators such as Avis Rent a Car System and Budget Rent a Car; real estate brokerages such as Coldwell Banker, Century 21 Real Estate and Sotheby's International Realty; as well as Orbitz Worldwide. Early life and education Born to a Jewish family,Silbiger, Steve The Jewish Phenomenon: Seven Keys to the Enduring Wealth of a People p. 91 in Brooklyn, the son of the chief executive of commercial finance firm James Talcott Inc.BusinessWeek: \\"HENRY SILVERMAN: THE REAL ARTIST OF THE DEAL? - This empire builder is riding high, but investors are jittery\\" By Joseph Weber June 14, 1997 Silverman graduated with a B.A. from Williams College and then a J.D. from University of Pennsylvania Law School. He served in the United States Navy Reserves and then practiced tax law. Career Early career (1965-1990) Silverman began his career in business as an assistant to Steve Ross, who was then assembling the future Warner Communications. Silverman had graduated from Williams College with a BA in Art History in 1961 and spent the following three years earning a JD from the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1964. Silverman left the job with Ross, which had been secured by Silverman's father, a well known businessman himself, to join White, Weld & Company an investment banking firm. After a short stint in investment banking, Silverman pursued a number of entrepreneurial ventures in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. In 1984, Silverman joined Reliance Group Holdings, which was run by corporate raider Saul Steinberg. Silverman then served as president and CEO of Telemundo, the Spanish-language television network from 1986 through 1990. While at Reliance, Silverman acquired Days Inn, the US hotel chain in a $590 million deal. Silverman is estimated to have made a $125 million profit on the sale of Days Inn.. In 1990, Silverman accepted a position as partner at Blackstone Group, a private equity firm. However his tenure at Blackstone was cut short because of litigation between Prudential Insurance, one of Blackstone's largest investors, over a Steinberg deal in which Silverman had been involved.David Carey and John E. Morris, King of Capital: The Remarkable Rise, Fall and Rise Again of Steve Schwarzman and Blackstone (Crown 2010), pp. 120-21. In 1991, he left to head Hospitality Franchise Systems, an investment of Blackstone's that Silverman had overseen. He later build HFS into Cendant Corporation. Creating Cendant Corporation (1991-2006) Building on his experience with Days Inn, while at Blackstone Silverman created Hospitality Franchise Systems (HFS) which would acquire a number of hotel franchises. Among Silverman's purchases were such brands as Ramada and Howard Johnson's as well as Days Inn, which he was able to buy for $290 million (almost half what he had sold it for) after the company had filed for bankruptcy in 1991.King of Capital, pp. 112-15, 116-17. Hospitality Franchise Systems went public in a 1992 IPO. HFS was among the fastest growing companies of its size in the 1990s and the company's stock had risen from its IPO price of $4 per share to $77 per share by 1998. However, in 1998, Silverman led Cendant into what would prove a disastrous merger with CUC, a direct marketing company that operated Shoppers Advantage and Travelers Advantage (now part of Affinion Group. The $14 billion merger of HFS and CUC resulted in Cendant Corporation, which was formed in December 1997. Also, as part of the merger, Silverman announced he would reduce his day-to-day involvement with the company and assume the company's chairmanship in preference of CUC's founder and CEO Walter Forbes. Just months after the merger, in April 1998 Cendant uncovered massive accounting improprieties at CUC and resulted in one of the largest financial scandals of the 1990s. After the accounting scandal was uncovered, Silverman and the Cendant board forced Forbes‚Äô resignation and Silverman assumed the CEO post. Under Silverman, Cendant bounced back from the accounting scandal far outperforming the markets in the early 2000s. Silverman's compensation was the subject of scrutiny in 2004. In 2002, on the back of strong performance at Cendant, Silverman signed a 10-year contract that provided for medical benefits, office space as well as travel perks including a corporate airplane and a company car and driver. Of greater attention was the compensation Silverman received in 2003. Silverman's 2003 compensation was estimated at $60 million, which included $14 million in cash salary and bonus, $37 million in stock options and $4.6 million paid as premiums on a company funded life insurance policy. In September 2006, Silverman championed the separation of Cendant Corporation into four independent companies. Cendant spun off its real estate brokerage division, Realogy which was sold to Apollo Global Management and sold its travel distribution services division, Travelport, to The Blackstone Group. Cendant's hospitality services division, is now a separate company Wyndham Worldwide.

Plot  Love sparks when Adam, back visiting Cairo from University of California, Los Angeles, meets Haname, native journalist from a smaller town of Egypt in seek of a juicy story to expose the gritty truth about corruption running rampant in the country. A sappy romance between the two youth ensues, and the two quickly get married in the breathtaking deserts of Egypt. Adam's mother, Margaret, very much Americanized and obsessed with Western culture, expresses much displeasure with her son's rash decision to marry a girl such as Haname, when it would be better to marry a wealthy Western woman, believing \\"money is the only thing that binds.\\" Out of an unhealthy attachment with her son, she stalks information on Haname based on what he told her (something she has done before), and finds that her son's newlywed is related to a terrorist in another conflict-ridden part of the Middle East. Hoping to get Adam to divorce Haname, she tells him about her findings but it backfires, costing her his trust. Still, Haname and Adam come to butt heads when he finds out Haname has been trying to find dirt on the corrupted, wealthy Americans that his father has been in connection with in Cairo, and demands that she stop what she's doing.

Biography Eleonora Luisa Gonzaga married Francesco Maria de' Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro (titles inherited from his mother) on 14 July 1709. Her husband was 48 years old and morbidly obese.

Eleonora Luisa was repulsed by her husband, refusing to fulfil her marital duties.

Life  Joint rule with Otto III William was born around the year 1300 as the fourth child of Otto the Strict and his wife, Matilda of Bavaria. On his father's death, William took over the reins of state jointly with his brother Otto III. This was against his father's will because Otto II had wanted the state to be divided after his death. The focus of the brothers' reign in the early years was the territorial consolidation of the principality. For example, they succeeded in expanding their estate in the area of Gifhorn considerably through the acquisition of the village of Fallersleben and the counties of Papenheim and Wettmarshagen. Another focus of attention was their political support of economically growing towns. For example, L√ºneburg trade flourished as a result of work to make the Ilmenau navigable between L√ºneburg and Uelzen as well as trade agreements between the L√ºneburg princes and the dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg. Selecting the successor Following the death of his brother, Otto III, William increasingly turned his attention to the question of succession in the state of L√ºneburg. Because his brother had lost his only son as a child and he himself had no eligible daughters, he selected his grandson, Albert of Saxe- Wittenberg, the son of his daughter Elizabeth, as his successor. In fact he had previously asked Emperor Charles IV for the eventual enfeoffment of the state to his grandson, but backed away again in the years that followed, because he feared the influence of Albert's uncles, Wenceslas and Rudolf. A further reason may be found in the terms of the Brunswick-L√ºneburg investiture agreement of 1235 as well as the succession treaties agreed by William's father with the Brunswick line of the House of Welf, according to which the principality had to be passed to any male heir within the entire Welf house if there were one. In order to satisfy his desire for one of his descendants to inherit the state, he married off his younger daughter, Matilda, to Louis of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Because the latter was heir to the Brunswick region the divided estate of the ducal house would once again be united under one ruler. Unaware of this, Emperor Charles IV had meanwhile authorised the enfeoffment of Albert of Saxe-Wittenberg and his two uncles and, with that, laid the foundation stone for the L√ºneburg War of Succession that began on William's death. Other problems were added by William's niece, Matilda, the daughter of his brother, Otto III. Her husband, Otto II of Waldeck, made claims against William. The imperial court awarded Otto 100,000 marks which amounted to about half the principality. In response to William's refusal to pay this, an imperial ban was imposed at first and, after a further vain attempt at mediation, the Emperor pronounced that he should be made an outlaw and tasked the Bishop of Minden to carry this out personally. Whether this actually happened is not known. Facing death, he finally handed rule of the principality to Magnus of Brunswick-L√ºneburg who, after the death of his brother, Louis, had been named as heir to the principality. William died on 23 November 1369 in L√ºneburg. Marriages and issue  William had a daughter by each of his four wives. From his 1st marriage to Hedwig of Ravensberg (d. after 1387), daughter of Otto IV, Count of Ravensberg: # Elizabeth (d. 1384) m.

A fifth adventure, originally performed on stage in 1997, was edited and released as a movie in 2010.http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/08/28/kultur/film/brodrene_dal/trond_kirkvaag/knut_lystad/7844016/ The series bears many similarities to Monty Python's Flying Circus, as the three actors play nearly all the different roles in the series, often multiple roles in each episode. Usually, the series would have a main plot keeping the story and episodes together, but most of the content being semi-related or unrelated sketches. This is especially true for the first series Professor Dr√∏vels Hemmelighet (1979), where the story frequently diverges from the main plot for entire episodes, only to jump back to the plot in the last minute. In the other series, the story is more centered on the actual plot. The name \\"Dal\\" literally means \\"valley\\", and is a common Norwegian surname. The names of the characters are based on locations in Norway with the word \\"dal\\" in them (confer Gausdal, Romsdal and Brumunddal) and are not themselves common first names. The names of the brother's parents, Halling and Mari, is similarly an obvious reference to Hallingdal and Maridalen.  Characters   Main Characters  * Gaus Dal (born late 1940s).Mentioned in episode 11 of \\"Spektralsteinene\\" The oldest of the three brothers, and the brain of the three. Always sports a hat similar to that of Indiana Jones. Played by Lars Mj√∏en. * Roms Dal (born late 1940s). The middle brother, and the more humorous and silly of the three. Always sports a brimmed Australian hat. Played by Knut Lystad. * Brumund Dal (born late 1940s). The youngest brother, and the outside-the-box thinker. Always sports a propeller hat. Played by Trond Kirkvaag. * The Narrator (Fortelleren) ‚Äì while originally just a voice-over narrator whose main task it was to sum up the events of the previous episodes and make various absurd predictions about the next episode (as well as absurd comments and interjections during the actual events transpiring), but in Spektralsteinene he began developing into a character in his own right, making on-screen appearances and finally officially met the main characters. From then on, the three brothers would often interact with him, reacting and responding to his narration, often resulting in comical situations breaking the fourth wall. He was played by comedian Tom Mathisen.  Secondary Characters  * Halling Dal (died before 1979), was the father of the three brothers, and leader of the fictional resistance group MILORD during World War II. He encountered his three sons during their time travels in Spektralsteinene, but they used false last names to avoid suspicion. He later promised to name his three sons after they helped him, meaning that the brothers are named after themselves. He was married to Mari Dal, and they both died some time prior to the first series, probably in the early 1970s based on comments made by the brothers when encountering them in Spektralsteinene. * Snerting, Joste and Mette-Mari Dal are the teenaged nephews and niece of the three brothers, though it's deliberately left unclear who their parents are. They appear only in Karl XIIs Gamasjer. Snerting is played by Mads Buer, Joste by Martin Lotherington and Mette-Mari by Agnes Kittelsen. * Prof. Kurt Dr√∏vel ‚Äì scientist and professor who disappeared during an expedition in the 1950s, with several rescue attempts in the following decades all failing. The Dal brothers set out to find him in 1979, eventually discovering his secret: a giant egg, but no signs of the professor. However, it turns out that the Professor was inside the egg, but with the experience having made him cluck like a chicken. He reappeared in cameos during the later series. He was played by Helge Reiss. *Prof. Ledwin Slatters ‚Äì scientist and professor who hopes to find a cure for the common cold using substances from an old meteorite. It is whilst helping prof. Slatters dig for a piece of the meteorite that the brothers accidentally find the first spectral stone, triggering the Spectral Stones adventure. He was played by Arne Bang-Hansen.  Villains and helpers  *  Adventures   Prof. Dr√∏vel's Secret (Professor Dr√∏vels Hemmelighet)  Originally aired in 1979 with 13 episodes (15 minutes each, except the first and last episode, 25 minutes) The main plot of this adventure takes place on the fictional unexplored river Overfloden, where the brothers are searching for the long-lost professor Dr√∏vel, who mysteriously disappeared while exploring the river 25 years earlier. However, the episodes frequently diverge from the main plot into unrelated sketches.  The Spectral Stones (Spektralsteinene)  Originally aired in 1982 with 13 episodes (15 minutes each, except the first and last episode, which are 25 minutes long). In this adventure, the brothers (with the help of a blueprint delivered by an alien spaceship) build a machine that travels through time and space, powered by the mysterious spectral stones, the source of incredible power. At each destination (which includes the Viking Age, the Old West, ancient Egypt, 18th century France, and a desert island) the brothers must find a new spectral stone in order to eventually get back to their own time.  The Legend of Atlant-Ice (Legenden om Atlant-Is)  Originally aired in 1994, with 12 episodes (20 minutes each). This adventure focus on the brothers' search for the lost sacred Saami city of Atlant-Is (Atlant-Ice), whilst investigating strange activities nearby. This was the first series to feature main characters other than the three brothers and narrator, and was originally planned to be the final series about the brothers.  The Mystery of Charles XII's spats (Mysteriet om Karl XIIs gamasjer)  Originally aired in 2005 with ten 30 minute episodes. With the 100th anniversary of the union dissolution approaching, the brothers must travel back in time to find King Charles XII's long-lost spats that disappeared some 300 years ago. If they do not recover the spats before the anniversary, Norway will be forced to re- enter a union with Sweden. This is the last series about the brothers, following Kirkvaag's death in 2007.  Planned fifth series  Following the success of the latest series, production was commissioned in 2006 for a fifth series, but Kirkvaag's illness delayed the project, ultimately bringing it to a halt as he began treatment. When it became clear that he was in no condition to film a full, new series, the project was scrapped in favor of a re-editing of their 1997 stage performance (See below).  The Curse of the Viking Sword (Vikingssverdets forbannelse)  Originally performed on stage in 1997, this adventure was edited and released as a feature film in 2010. Gaus and Roms are accidentally sent back in time to the Viking Age, while Brumund is left behind in the present, and must help his brothers get back to their own time via video link. After the failure to produce a fifth series, the two remaining members of the trio began working on the project in 2007, and it was released in theaters on 10 September 2010. Trond Kirkvaag's parts were recorded separately before his death from colorectal cancer, whilst the rest of the movie was edited from the 1997 recordings. Editing was completed in 2009, and it was released in 2010.  Theme music  All the series have had different opening themes, but they all had the same trademark closing theme, the overture of The Eye of Wendor by Mandalaband. In the first three series the recording with Mandalaband was used, but for the fourth one a new recording was made by the Norwegian Radio Orchestra (Kringkastingsorkestret).  Home media  In addition to several reruns since first being aired, the first two series were released on VHS in 1988. The third series were released on VHS in 1995, before all three series were re-released on DVD in 2000, albeit in non- restored forms, using the VHS masters. In 2010, all four series of the show were released on remastered DVDs both individually and as a box set. No plans have been announced regarding a Blu-ray release. The first two series were shot on 35 mm film, whilst the third and fourth were shot digitally.

The entire length has been designated as part of the Provo Canyon Scenic Byway. Route description US‚Äë189, April 2016 SR‚Äë113 begins at the intersection of South 3600 West/Charleston Road and US‚Äë189 on the northeast shore of Deer Creek Reservoir on the southwestern corner of Charleston. From its southern terminus, the route heads north as a two-lane road along South 3600 West/Charleston Road to pass through the length of the west side of Charleston. Along the way it connects with the west end of West 3600 South before passing by the west side of the Charleston City Park. On the north edge of the park, the route connects with the west end of West 3400 South, and then the west ends of West 3300 South, West 3150 South, and West 3000 South. The route then connects with a gravel road that heads west to the Deer Creek State Park Charleston Day Use Area, followed by a connection with the west end of West 2400 South on the northwest edge of town. Immediately after leaving Charleston, the route enters the northeastern part of Deer Creek State Park and makes its first crossing over the Provo River. The route then connects with a Rest Area (on the east side of the road) before a level crossing over the single set of tracks for the Heber Valley Railroad (formerly known as the Heber Creeper), just west of the Charleston station. Immediately after crossing the tracks, the route connects with the east end of Tate Lane (formerly Utah State Route 220), the road to the Soldier Hollow area of the Wasatch Mountain State Park. (Tate Lane also provides access to the Cascade Springs area in the Uinta National Forest.) The route also begins running along the border of Midway (to the east), until it fully enters the city, about north of the railroad tracks. Just after entering Midway, SR‚Äë113 crosses over the small Snake Creek, as it passes by some recently constructed residential developments to the west. Continuing north (again along the border of Midway, but with the city now to the west) the route connects with the east end of West 970 South and the west end of East 850 South (which leads to the Midway Fish Hatchery). Passing briefly back into an unincorporated area of Wasatch County, the route connects with the southeast end of South Appenzell Lane, before re-entering Midway. Continuing north through Midway, SR‚Äë113 (signed as South Center Street) connects with the west end of East 500 South, the west end of East 450 South, and the east end of West 350 South. After crossing 300 South and 100 South (passing through a residential area), the route reaches Main Street at a junction with the southern end of Utah State Route 222 (SR‚Äë222). At this intersection, the route turns east along East Main Street, while North Center Street continues north, and West Main Street continues west as SR‚Äë222 towards the Homestead Resort, the Zermatt Resort, and the main part of Wasatch Mountain State Park. Looking east along Main Street toward the junction of SR‚Äë113 and Utah State Route 222, April 2016 Heading east along the three-lane East Main Street, SR‚Äë113 passes through the east end of Midway's business district. (In addition to the center turn lane, Main Street has bicycle lanes on both sides of the road between 200 West and 300 East.) After crossing 100 East, the area becomes mix of residences and businesses as it crosses 200 East and connects with the south end of North 300 East and reaching 400 East/River Road. (While South 400 East only continues south to just beyond East 100 South, North 400 East continues north as North River Road to East 1050 North, before heading northeasterly to Midway Junction, where it connects with US‚Äë40/US‚Äë189 and the southern end of Utah State Route 32.) Shortly after connecting with the northern ends of South 500 East (Fox Den Lane), South 580 East, and South 700, SR‚Äë113 curves southeast (becoming West Midway Lane) and runs along the eastern border of Midway (connecting with the south end of Johnson Mill Road) until it reaches its connection with the north end of South 950 East (Michie Lane). Looking southwest across SR‚Äë113 at the Legacy Bridge over the Provo River, April 2016 The route then leaves Midway, and begins curving back to an eastern direction, before reaching the north end of South 1000. The route then promptly makes its second crossing over the Provo River. Just south of the bridge over the Provo River is the Legacy Bridge. (An urban jogging/biking trail that runs along the south side of SR‚Äë113 from South 700 East in Midway to South 600 East in Heber City crosses that bridge.) East of the river, the route completes it curve to the east and connects with the south end of South Ryan Lane. Heading east, SR‚Äë113 connects with the south end of South 1750 West before crossing over Spring Creek and then (through open fields) continues east to connect with the north end of South 1140 West (Southfield Road). East of South 1140 West SR‚Äë113 runs along the border of Heber City (with city and its Southfield Park to the south) until it crosses the Sagebrush and Spring Creek Canal. East of the canal the route fully enters Heber City and runs along East 100 South for the remainder of its course. Shortly after connecting with the north end of South 780 West, the route begins a slight jog to the south and then crosses South 600 East. (Prior to being removed in the 1970s, the rail tracks that were part of what is now the Heber Valley Railroad crossed the route, immediately west of South 600 East, and continued north to the Heber Depot. The former depot is still located on at the east end of West Center Street. The current depot building for, and northern terminus for, the historic railroad is located south on South 600 East at 450 South.) Just after crossing South 500 East, the route completes its slight jog to the south, crosses South 400 East, and begins passing through three blocks of residential areas. After crossing South 300 East, South 200 East, and South 100 East, the route passes through a block of the business district before reaching its northern terminus at South Main Street (US‚Äë40/US‚Äë189). East 100 South continues east to end at South 5000 East, while South Main Street continues south to the Provo Canyon Junction on the south end of town and north past the east side of the Jordanelle Reservoir to Silver Creek Junction, where it connects with Interstate 80. History The route was first defined by the Utah State Legislature in 1931 and has not seen any significant changes since then. In 1935, the legislature designated State Route 169, which began on US-40 one block north of the eastern terminus of SR-113. From there, that route ran east along Center Street and Lake Creek Road to Lake Creek. It was decommissioned in 1953.

It is released under the Apache License version 2.0. Architecture Its classes are divided in the following categories:Platform Overview Apache Pivot * Core classes that enable the classes in the other categories to function * WTK classes that provide user interface elements such as buttons and lists. These are built according to the model-view-controller architecture. Most of Pivot's classes are included in the WTK category. * Web classes that enable communication with remote computers * Charts that allow the software engineer to build interactive charts * Tools that provide utility functionality WTK WTK or widgets toolkit are the graphical components of Apache Pivot. There are more widgets than in other Java GUI libraries like JFC/Swing, SWT or JavaFX. The components are based on Java2D and are completely skinnable and support color schemes. The demos \\"Kitchen Sink\\" and \\"Component Explorer\\" give a complete overview and show the possibilities of interaction. Additionally, it is easy to add and use self-made components because of the open structure. Also part of WTK are the so-called decorators which add graphical effects and even animations to the components. BXML In Apache Pivot, the GUI usually is designed using BXML files. BXML is an XML-based markup language for simplifying the construction of Java object hierarchies. While it is most often used to define the user interface of an Apache Pivot application, it is not limited to user interface construction, and can actually be used to create hierarchies of any object type. In the case of Apache Pivot the designer can place the WTK-components and set their properties without writing a single line of Java code. In more complex projects there usually is one class file for each BXML file to hold the logic, though there are other possibilities. Scripting Apache Pivot supports all JSR 223 scripting languages to script the BXML files. It is even possible to create an entire Pivot application without any compiled code at all. The script fragments can either be placed inside certain tags directly inside a BXML file, or in external files which get included during runtime. Non-GUI features The WTK is just one part of Pivot, but it is a complete RIA framework. Pivot has its own Collection API (to ease synchronizing the contents to the GUI) and APIs for accessing REST web services and parsing RSS, JSON and XML.

The term is used in the context of narratology and refers to a theory of narration and literary presentation. Huntley and Phillips have taught the theory at the University of California at Los Angeles, where it was part of a twelve-week \\"for credit\\" course for several years. The two also released a book entitled Dramatica ‚Äì A New Theory of Story via Write Brothers Press, the publishing arm of Write Brothers, which was founded by Stephen Greenfield and Chris Huntley.Dramatica ‚Äì A New Theory of Story, online version. There are two different versions of the Dramatica software. The first, Dramatica Pro, was released in the 1990s and supports both Windows and OS X. The second and more recently released version, Dramatica Story Expert, is OS X-only. The software guides users through the writing process by giving them a step-by-step guide that focuses on plot and theme creation as well as story structure. The software is based upon Huntley and Phillips's quad theory, which is described as \\"[dividing] a story unit into four pieces and [creating] relationships between those parts\\". The four quads, which makes up the Dramatic Table of Story Elements, are the Universe (representing situations), Mind (attitudes), Physics (activities) and Psychology (manners of thinking). The theory was originated in 1994 as a diagnostic modelling tool built around a concept called ‚ÄúThe Story Mind\\", which describes each story as having a mind of its own with its psychology built by the story‚Äôs structure and its personality is determined by the storytelling. In later years, the ongoing development of Dramatica was split into two branches. First is ongoing exploration into using the model to understand the workings of the human mind itself ‚Äì an area of research called (by the theory creators) Mental Relativity. The second area of development is the implementation of the model as a patented computer program called ‚ÄúThe Story Engine‚Äù which can be used to analyze story structures to find holes and inconsistencies and also used to interactively suggest how to fix and fill them.

The screenplay by Alvin Sargent is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1964 play of the same title by Paul Zindel. Newman cast his wife, Joanne Woodward, and one of their daughters, Nell Potts, in two of the lead roles. Roberta Wallach, daughter of Eli Wallach, played the third lead. Plot Middle-aged widow Beatrice Hunsdorfer (Joanne Woodward) and her daughters Ruth (Roberta Wallach) and Matilda (Nell Potts) are struggling to survive in a society they barely understand. Beatrice dreams of opening an elegant tea room but does not have the wherewithal to achieve her lofty goal. Epileptic Ruth is a rebellious adolescent, while shy but highly intelligent and idealistic Matilda seeks solace in her pets and school projects, including one which gives the film its title. Matilda's science experiment is designed to show how small amounts of gamma radiation from cobalt-60 affect marigolds; some die, but others transform into strange but beautiful mutations completely unlike the original plants. Similarly, Matilda has managed to muddle through a grim existence in a dilapidated, debris-ridden house in a lower middle class neighborhood, learning to deal with her embarrassing mother while managing to avoid becoming anything like her, a future for which her sister seems fated.

Critical reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times observed, \\"The Effect of Gamma Rays is not a stupid film. The talents of everyone connected with it are unmistakable, including those of Mr. Newman, a director of plain, straight style. It's just that the basic material calls for a kind of second- rate bravura performance from everyone, from the production designer to the actors. There's no way to underplay it. At times I had the feeling that Miss Woodward was auditioning for the role of Sadie Thompson, and that Miss Wallach was occasionally in competition. Only Nell Potts (in private life, the daughter of Miss Woodward and Mr. Newman) is allowed to perform at something like a reasonable pace. It's a lovely, solemn performance in a film that otherwise succeeds in being simultaneously too barren and too busy, like Beatrice herself.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film \\"is hard-edged enough to be less depressing than it sounds\\" and noted \\"Joanne Woodward's performance is not like anything she's ever done before . . . It serves notice that she is capable of experimenting with roles that are against type and making them work.\\" He added, \\"Paul Newman's direction is unobtrusive; he directs as we expect an actor might, looking for the dramatic content of a scene rather than its visual style . . . And the performance by Nell Potts is extraordinary. She glows.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Variety commented, \\"Newman has gotten it all together here as a director, letting the story and the players unfold with simplicity, restraint and discernment.\\"Variety review Time Out London called the film \\"an engaging adaptation\\" of the play \\"which sees Paul Newman's cool, lucid direction transforming what could have been a pretentious domestic drama into a touching account of small joys in sad and stunted lives ...

According to a 2006 survey of patent owners at the European Patent Office, about half of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) take patents for monetary reasons. Working paper on SSRN Some of these owners try to make money from patents on inventions they develop, manufacture or market. Others attempt to generate revenue by buying and enforcing patents against one or more alleged infringers in a manner considered by the target or observers as unduly aggressive or opportunistic, often with no intention to further develop, manufacture or market the patented invention. The latter group is pejoratively called patent trolls by their critics. History Texas Instruments is believed to be the first company to monetize in the 1990s its portfolio of patents (more than 38,000 in total) when the company was losing market share to competitors. After the Texas Instruments example, IBM was another company who used the same technique in the 1990s to monetize its own patents to make more than $1 billion annually in revenue. Microsoft use its patents to make deals with the major Android vendors, which amount to more than 70% of Android's market share. Eastman Kodak is an example of a struggling company which use its patents portfolio to make additional revenue. For example, it is said that Kodaks' licensing programs have generated more than $3 billion in revenue since 2004. Nokia generated ‚Ç¨500 million from patents in 2013.

Crump was the first individual to perform a long-term ecological study on a community of tropical amphibians, and did pioneering work in the classification of variability in amphibian egg size as a function of habitat predictability. She has co-authoried one of the most popular modern herpetology textbooks, Herpetology (1997-2015) as well as the memoir In Search of the Golden Frog (2000) and a number of other books for both adults and children. In 1997, she received the Distinguished Herpetologist Award from The Herpetologists‚Äô League. Childhood Martha L. \\"Marty\\" Crump was born in Madison, Wisconsin, and her interest in ecology and the environment were spurred by her childhood spent in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York. Education and Research While an undergraduate at the University of Kansas, she worked in the herpetology division of the Museum of Natural History, and after graduation, she participated in a faunal survey of amphibians and reptiles in a remote area of the upper Amazon Basin, Ecuador. She received her Masters at the University of Kansas for her research in Brazil concerning amphibians and reptiles, and did her doctorate research in Ecuador on frogs‚Äô reproductive behavior. After receiving her Ph.D. from the University of Kansas, she became a professor of zoology at the University of Florida, where she continued her research in Ecuador, and also performed research in Costa Rica and Argentina, focusing on amphibian parental care, cannibalism, and reproduction. Crump was the first individual to perform a long-term ecological study on a community of tropical amphibians. She studied reproductive strategies in the neotropical anuran community at Santa Cecilia, Ecuador and recognized ten different modes of reproduction. These categories were later modified and adapted for all anuran reproductive patterns that scientists are currently aware of. Crump was also a pioneer in classifying variability in amphibian egg size as a function of habitat predictability. Her research, focusing on tropical tree frogs, shows that in species that breed in temporary ponds, individual females produce clutches that have a greater range of egg sizes while those breeding in permanent ponds have a very concentrated distribution, rarely deviating from the mean. She has also been involved in several conservation activities, including acting as a board member of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as part of the DAPTF (Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force) from 2000 to 2010. She has held several editorial positions including Associate Editor of Herpetological Natural History from 2000 to 2006 and has served as an officer in several professional organizations including the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, and The Herpetologists‚Äô League. She is currently the Program Officer for the annual scientific conference Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (JMIH). Crump co-authored all four editions of one of the two most popular modern herpetology textbooks, Herpetology (1997-2015). Her other books include a memoir, In Search of the Golden Frog (2000). In addition to books for adults, she has written several books for children, including Amphibians and Reptiles: An Introduction to Their Natural History and Conservation (2011) and The Mystery of Darwin's Frog (2013). In 1997, Crump received the Distinguished Herpetologist Award from The Herpetologists‚Äô League.

Through her mother's second marriage she was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty and through her marriage to Pyrrhus she was queen of Epirus. Antigone was the daughter and the second child of Berenice, a noblewoman from Eordeaea, and her first husband Philip. She had an elder brother called Magas and a younger sister called Theoxena. Antigone's father, Philip was the son of Amyntas by an unnamed mother.Ancient Library article: Philippus no. 5 Based on Plutarch (Pyrrhus 4.4), her father was previously married and had children, including daughters. He served as a military officer in the service of the Macedonian King Alexander the Great and commanded one of the Phalanx divisions in Alexander's wars. Berenice's mother was the niece of the powerful regent AntipaterHeckel, Who‚Äôs who in the age of Alexander the Great: prosopography of Alexander‚Äôs empire, p.71 and was related to members of the Argead dynasty. About 318 BC, Antigone's father died of natural causes. After Philip's death, Antigone's mother took her and her siblings to Egypt where they were a part of the entourage of her mother's cousin Eurydice. Eurydice was then the wife of Ptolemy I Soter, the first ruler and founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty. By 317 BC, Ptolemy I had fallen in love with Berenice and divorced Eurydice to marry her. Through her mother's marriage to Ptolemy I, Antigone was a stepdaughter to Ptolemy I and lived in her stepfather's court. Her mother bore Ptolemy I three children: two daughters, Arsinoe II, Philotera and the future Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus. In 300 BC or 299 BC, Pyrrhus of Epirus was sent as a hostage to Egypt by Demetrius I of Macedon as part of a short-lived rapprochement between Demetrius I and Ptolemy I. In 299 BC/298 BC, Ptolemy I arranged for Pyrrhus to marry Antigone.Plutarch, Pyrrhus 4.4Pausanias, 1.11.5 Pyrrhus obtained a fleet of ships and funding from Ptolemy I and set sail with Antigone for his kingdom in Epirus.Ussher, The Annals of the World, p.344 Pyrrhus came into an agreement with his relative Neoptolemus II of Epirus, who had usurped the kingdom, to jointly rule Epirus. Antigone bore Pyrrhus two children: a daughter called Olympias and a son called Ptolemy. Antigone possibly died in childbirth, as she seems to have died the same year as her son was born. As a posthumous honour to his first wife, Pyrrhus founded a colony called Antigonia, which he named after her. References Sources * G.

Holton is the winner of the K.W. Irmisch 'Arts Person of the Year' Award in 2016 from the City of Burlington. In 2018, she received the Alumni of Influence award by University College, University of Toronto and was nominated for the Premier of Ontario Arts Award. Biography Early life and education Originally from the rural district of north Burlington Ontario, Holton attended primary school at Hillfield Strathallan College in Hamilton, and public high school at M. M. Robinson High School in Burlington, before completing a 4 year English Literature Major/Philosophy Minor B.A at the University of Toronto. Her third year at university was spent at the University of Edinburgh, where she focused on the history of the English Language. While in Scotland, she traveled to the Outer Hebrides on a walk-study tour of the islands. She traveled through northern Ireland and stayed at a rented croft cottage on the west coast. She also traveled through eastern Russia, exploring the cities of Leningrad and Moscow. After this third year of study, she toured western Europe. Returning to Toronto, Canada, Holton began a succession of jobs in the Canadian publishing and film industry, including: Assistant Editor at Andrew Marshall's FM GUIDE Magazine; proof-reader and typesetter at Typesettra-Fotocomp under type designer, Les Usherwood; sales rep of T.H.Best Book Binding & Printing and Production Assistant at Roseanne McWaters Vin Lint and Associates, a commercial film production house in downtown Toronto. Career In 1978, Holton registered her design business, MLH Productions, under which she has undertaken a number of artistic ventures. Holton is a designer of Canadian fine furniture and typefaces. She is also the author of eleven book works of poetry, prose, social history & photography. She has produced and performed for two musical CDs - Summer Haze (2014) (jazz piano) and CANADADA: TAKE TWO (2017) (spoken word & electro-pop). In 2015, she produced, directed and wrote a classic Canadian WW1 film, The Frozen Goose. Holton is a pinhole and photo- collage photographer. Holton makes all of her own pinhole cameras from found cardboard boxes and tins. She hand-processes the negatives and prints in editions of one to five. All authentic MLH prints are signed, numbered and dated by her. She began pinholing in 2001 after taking a two-hour pinhole course with pinholer, Di Bos. Her pinhole works have been exhibited at the Homer Watson Public Art Gallery of Kitchener, Ontario, and Art Gallery of Burlington, Ontario, and the Sovereign House Museum of Oakville (managed by the Bronte Historical Society). In August 2010. The Art Gallery of Burlington published an exhibition monograph to the exhibition with an essay by Canadian author, David Macfarlane. Canadian documentarian, Peter Wintonick, wrote the foreword for the exhibition companion hard-cover book, Memory's Shadow: Pinhole & Photo-Collage Photography by Margaret Lindsay Holton. The title was reviewed by Jeff Mahoney, art critic for The Hamilton Spectator, who wrote, \\"Memory's Shadow confirms our impression of Holton as an important mixed-media practitioner, with a genuine artist's eye and a probing intellect.\\"Jeff Mahoney, \\"Memory's Shadow,\\" The Hamilton Spectator, Summer, 2010.  Painting  Holton‚Äôs paintings are \\"naive-surreal-folk-abstracts\\", a descriptive moniker that demonstrates how her work falls outside of traditional and current 'art schools'. Nature, environmental themes and planet Earth predominate in her work. Canadada: A Painter's Nature, published by Acorn Press Canada, accurately describes and illustrates her 40 year career of painting in oils and acrylics. She has participated in over one hundred group exhibitions in Canada, the US and Europe and participated in solo and studio tours over the past two decades. Holton is a former member of the Women's Art Association of Canada, a current member of the Women's Art Association of Hamilton, the Fine Arts Society of Milton, and The Arts & Culture Collective of Burlington. Holton continues to exhibit regularly throughout the Golden Horseshoe region of southern Ontario, Canada.  Type Design  In 1979, Holton designed the 'Lindsay' (TM) typeface. Hand-drawn pencil templates were supplied to Letraset England in a license for the dry transfer 'letter' market. \\"Lindsay' was one of the first typeface designs to be digitized using Peter Karow's innovative IKARUS system. The 'Lindsay' typeface was used in collaboration by both Letraset and URW++ of Hamburg, Germany as a 'demo font' to demonstrate IKARUS's capabilities in the early 1980s. 'Lindsay' was also used as the defining font for the popular board game, Carcassone. Holton has completed two other typeface designs, Gato and CANADA. Neither of these designs has been released to the public. They remain as 'pencil drawings' within her oeuvre of work.  Writing  Holton studied English literature at the University of Toronto, and produced her first written works in the 1980s. She began her first novel, Economic Sex, while working as an English tutor in Spain in 1984. This literary work was published by Coach House Press of Toronto, under pen-name, Ali Janna Whyte, in 1985. She produced and edited 'The Spirit of Toronto: 1934-1984', a compendium of essays by religious leaders of 45 different faiths highlighting multiculturalism in Toronto. Launched at Fort York, a hard copy was presented to the Pope's personal secretary. Holton registered her artist's press, Acorn Press Canada, in Ontario, in 1997. As a writing artist, she published her second novel, The Gilded Beaver by Anonymous, (1999), as well as two books of poetry, On Top of Mount Nemo (2002), and Bush Chord, (2006, with an e-edition in 2012) under her artists' imprint. The Gilded Beaver by Anonymous novel won the Hamilton Arts Council 'Best Fiction Award' in 1999. Her third novel, TRILLIUM, was self- published and released in October of 2018  Fine Furniture Design & Construction  Holton apprenticed with her father, the late Luther Janna Holton (1922-2002), cabinetmaker and sole-proprietor of Holton Fine Furniture of Hamilton before going into business for herself in 1986 as a Canadian fine furniture designer in Toronto under 'MLH Productions'. Her furniture works can be found in national public and international private collections, including the Royal Ontario Museum, (curio box & display cabinets), the Canadian Film Centre, (library reception), Stanley Ho of Hong Kong (bedroom & dining room suite), David C.W. MacDonald of Toronto ('Temagami' pedestals, 'Wolf Settee Courting Bench' & 'Thee Mirror), Rosamond Ivey of Toronto (bedroom suite) and Elizabeth Hanson of Toronto (children beds). The Hanson commission of 'three children's beds designed by MLH' was published in 'Furniture: Architects & Designers Originals' by Carol Soucek King, MFA, PhD in 1994. Holton and Frank Gehry were the only Canadians honoured in this publication about international furniture designers. One commission, 'The Four Canadian Fireside Chairs' was the subject of her second novel, The Gilded Beaver by Anonymous.  Filmmaking  Holton began working in film with Jane Walker Manchee, as co- producer, director, writer and sound recordist for their first 54 min documentary, In the Eye of the Hunter (1984-1986). The film was broadcast on Cable 10, Toronto, for six months in a late night spot. Over the last 20 years, Holton has created over forty additional short documentary films, under 15 minutes each. In 2015, Holton's film & photographic works were shown in The World's Shortest Film Fest, as part of the Niagara Film Festival and Oakville Film Festival. Her 14-minute documentary, 'Harold Dickert: Burlington Luthier', was shown at the Hamilton Music & Film Festival in September 2015. Her documentary, 'David Lambert: Fastest Knot-Tyer in Canada', was shown at the 10th Annual Hamilton Film Festival in November 2015. Her first dramatic narrative short film (25 minutes), The Frozen Goose, was based on her published short story of the same name, included as the end story in the WW1 anthology, Engraved: Canadian Stories of WW1, published by Seriphim Editions in 2014. Shot in February 2016, with a cast of five, at Westfield Heritage Centre in Rockton and other rural historic locations, the world premier of this period film was held at the Art Gallery of Burlington, on September 11, 2016. It screened twice during the 11th Annual Hamilton Film Festival. After a brief local theatrical release, it was broadcast on COGECO Halton during Remembrance Week and on CABLE 14 Hamilton as a Christmas Special on December 16 in 2017. The film has since been licensed to educational distributor, McIntyre Media, for the domestic market.

In fact in his two-year-old season he raced three times. Not only did he not win but he did not even finish in-the-money in any of those three races. His record as a two-year-old was (3): 0-0-0 with annual earnings of $2,758 in 2004. That earnings figure would not even cover his feed bill for the year. The next year was even worse, he injured himself and only raced once as a three-year-old and the results were no different. Student Council did not even hit the board. His record as a three-year-old was (1): 0-0-0 with annual earnings of only $2,500 in 2005. As a four-year-old Student Council began to improve and learn from his defeats. He ran in a race in ten straight months from February through November. As the summer ended Student Council began to pick up pieces of the purse finishing third twice and then second. He finally broke his maiden and won his first race after 26 months and ten attempts. His maiden win came at Churchill Downs' Autumn Meet at eight and a half furlongs. He followed that score with another win at Keeneland again at eight and a half furlongs in an allowance race in 1:44.10. In his final race of the year he reeled off another allowance win in November at Turfway Park at an even mile in 1:37.62 on the all-whether track. He finished a successful year with three wins in his last four starts and a record of (10): 3-1-2 with annual earnings of $105,718. Thoroughbred Times Stallion Directory; Five- year-old season At age five, Student Council began to fill out and started taking on graded stakes company. In that company he not only fared well but he won prize money in some very impressive stakes races. He started the year with a second-place finish in the $150,000 grade three Razorback Handicap at Oaklawn Park. He lost that race to Magna Graduate on the first Saturday in March. Student Council raced again in March and won the $100,000 Maxxam Gold Cup Handicap at Sam Houston Park at nine furlongs by 3-1/4 lengths. On the first Saturday in May, Student Council placed third in the $115,000 grade three Alysheba Stakes at Churchill Downs on the Derby undercard. He lost that race to up and coming Wanderin Boy. In the summer of 2007, Student Council won two of the best races of his career. As a 23-1 longshot, he stunned the field of 12 in the $1,100,000 grade one Pacific Classic Stakes at Del Mar. Under jockey Richard Migliore he beat runners-up Awesome Gem and Hello Sunday as well as favorite Lava Man that August day at a mile and a quarter in 2:07.29. In September, he won his second straight graded race by winning the $500,000 grade two Hawthorne Gold Cup Handicap outside Chicago's Hawthorne Race Course. He beat Jonesboro and A. P. Arrow at ten furlongs in 2:05.00. The victory puts Student Council in the Breeders' Cup Classic through the 'Win and You're In' program. He finished the year as a millionaire with a record of (9): 4-2-1 and annual earnings of $1,041,755. Six-year-old season In his six-year-old season in 2008, Student Council fell back to his losing ways, failing to place in four straight races. His owner Ro Parra said Student Council struggled to recover from an eighth-place finish in the Japan Cup Dirt on November 24 at Nakayama racecourse. He finished fifth in the grade two San Antonio Handicap and sixth in the grade one Santa Anita Handicap both at Santa Anita Park. He came into the \\"Special\\" off a seventh-place finish in the grade three John B. Connally Turf Handicap at Sam Houston Race Park on April 5. He was moved from the barn of Vladimir Cerin and moved to Eclipse Award winning trainer Steve Asmussen. Student Council fought back like a Rocky story and won perhaps the most memorable race of his career in the $500,000 grade one Pimlico Special on the day before the Preakness Stakes. Dismissed at odds of 7.50-to-1, he was only one of two grade one winners in the field of seven. The victory was especially significant for owner Ro Parra because he grew up in Lexington Park, Maryland, and attended, by his estimate, at least 15 editions of the Preakness. Ridden for the first time by jockey Shaun Bridgmohan, Student Council rated in last as they passed the stands for the first time. Gotta Gold and Exchanger led the race and set a moderate early pace with fractions of :23.8, :47.4, and 1:11.3 in the first 3/4 of a mile. On the far turn Grasshopper, Sir Whimsey and Student Council rushed at the leaders. Gotta Gold was still leading at the top of the stretch clocking one mile at a time of 1:36. Down the lane, Student Council gradually reeled in Gottcha Gold, beating him by a neck at the wire in 1:54.8 on a muddy track. The top two cleared third-place finisher Sir Whimsey by 5-3/4 lengths. Mineshaft Handicap winner Grasshopper finished fifth as the 2-to-1 favorite. Later that year in July, he finished second in the $750,000 grade one Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Race Course to Commentator. In August he finished third in the $750,000 grade one Hollywood Gold Cup to Mast Track and Go Between. He record as a six-year-old was (7): 1-1-1 with annual earnings of $415,000. Retirement Student Council was retired following the Breeders' Cup World Championships in November, 2008. He entered stud duty in 2009 at Millennium Farms in Kentucky.

Paradigm Talent Agency has more than 200 agents representing clients in television, music performances, motion picture, theatre, book publishing, digital, commercial/voiceover, content finance, media rights, brand partnerships and beyond. Paradigm's clients included author Stephen King, actors Laurence Fishburne and Henry Golding, directors James Wan and Malcolm D. Lee, and musicians Coldplay, Tiffany Young, Halsey, and Ed Sheeran, as of 2018. Paradigm has won the Pollstar Award for Booking Agency of the Year four times, in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  Background  Sam Gores, Chairman and CEO, opened his first agency, SGA Representation, Inc. in 1986. SGA acquired The Jack Fields Agency and changed its name to Gores/Fields. The agency expanded further the following year, bringing ATM & Associates into the fold. During the years 1992 and 1993 Gores forged pacts with STE Representations; Robinson, Weintraub, Gross & Associates, and Shorr, Stille & Associates to create Paradigm Talent Agency. The agency's original Beverly Hills office was located on the old MCA Inc. campus built in 1932 where conference rooms honor Jules Stein and Lew Wasserman, who occupied the space. In 2018 the agency moved to the 82,000-square-foot Wilshire LaPeer building on Wilshire Blvd, where ICM was once headquartered.  Agency Growth  In 2004, Paradigm acquired the literary firm Genesis and the Writers & Artists Agency. The acquisition added a dozen agents and also brought a potent TV client list including 24 creator/executive producer Joel Surnow and Two and a Half Men co-creator/exec producer Lee Aronsohn to Paradigm. Paradigm made a major strategic move in 2004 by acquiring independent music agency Monterey Peninsula Artists, and followed up on that gain in 2006 by acquiring New York based music booking agency Little Big Man. Expanding their footprint in the music industry, in 2008, Paradigm acquired Ellis Industries, a leading independent music agency based in New York, and in 2009 acquired Third Coast Artists Agency, the largest independent Christian Music agency, which was headquartered in Nashville. Paradigm Chairman and CEO Sam Gores on what makes a good acquisition or partnership target when looking to expand: \\"It starts with who‚Äôs in charge, who‚Äôs at the base or foundation. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever make a deal with people who lack integrity or are not revered by the community in general, or who have a trail of bad history behind them. If it‚Äôs a good cultural fit, or if you think you can help them grow by having them be part of a bigger infrastructure and more access in areas of branding, film and television, then how does that complement the rest of our business in that area? For instance, Little Big Man and Monterey complemented each other -- Monterey had all the legacy artists and big bands and [LBM founder] Marty [Diamond] had all the cool stuff that was up-and-coming. That really rounded out our business.\\" In 2012, Paradigm expanded into the burgeoning electronic dance music business by forming a joint venture partnership with AM Only, a leading Electronic Dance Music agency whose client list includes genre superstars David Guetta, Skrillex and Ti√´sto. In January 2014, Paradigm acquired a 50% stake in the London-based Coda Agency. Strategically, the alliance planted a flag for Paradigm in London and, by extension, Europe and other international markets. The combination of Paradigm Talent Agency's Music Division, AM Only, and Coda Music Agency made Paradigm one of the top music agencies in the world, with clients including Coldplay, Dave Matthews Band, Ed Sheeran, Fun., Bon Iver, Janelle Mon√°e, Jason Mraz, The Lumineers and Phish, among others. Paradigm further expanded its European presence by partnering with London-based X-ray Touring in 2017. In January 2017, music agencies AM Only and The Windish Agency formally became known as Paradigm Talent Agency, after partnerships since 2012 and 2015, respectively. On 13 June 2018, Tiffany Young signed to the agency, almost a year after she left SM Entertainment in South Korea. On 18 April 2019, Paradigm named Marty Diamond as its new Head of Global Music.

She is a regular columnist for Al Jazeera English, writes for Global Voices Online, and is the author of Morocco - Culture Smart!: the essential guide to customs & culture. Career From 2004 to 2007, York spent considerable time in Morocco. In 2006, York authored MoroccoCulture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs & Culture, a travel book on Morocco. In an article written in 2011, York wrote about the function of blogs and social media sites such as Facebook providing Moroccans a forum for discussions and information deprived by the mainstream Moroccan media. In 2008, she joined the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, a research center at Harvard University that focuses on the study of cyberspace, where she worked on the OpenNet Initiative, a joint project whose goal is to monitor and report on internet filtering and surveillance practices by nations, and Herdict, and conducted research on distributed denial-of-service attacks. In 2011, she moved to the EFF, where she is the director of international freedom of expression. She is a founding member of the feminist collective Deep Lab with Addie Wagenknecht. York has been called \\"one of the leading scholars on Internet control and censorship\\" and a specialist on free expression and social media in the Arab world. Her research\\"Policing Content in the Quasi-Public Sphere\\". OpenNet Initiative. on the role of social media in the Arab Spring has been widely cited. In June 2011, Foreign Policy named her one of the top-100 intellectuals discussing foreign policy on Twitter. Free expression York's writing on free expression has also been published in The Guardian, Bloomberg and Foreign Policy. She is a regular columnist for Al Jazeera English and writes for Global Voices Online, where she is also on its board of directors as of 2011. She also co-founded Talk Morocco, which won the 2010 Deutsche Welle Best of Blogs Award for Best English-language blog. In May 2014, she gave a talk with Jacob Appelbaum suggesting the safer sex and harm reduction movements could show advocates of liberty and privacy how their work can better reach mainstream audiences. York's commentary and opinions include statements against censorship by corporations and social media organizations at the request of state governments. She holds the view that free speech should trump business interests York and EFF opposed the Philippines Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 because of provisions limiting online criticism in favor of a crowd sourced alternative, the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom which supports free expression and has less stringent limits on free expression online. Women in technology In 2013, when Wired included few women in its first batch of Wired's 101 Signals, a list of best writers and thinkers on the internet, York was among critics who noted the lack of women on the list. York thinks that women are sometimes given less recognition as technology intellectuals because they focus on topics less covered by popular tech magazines while in popular topics men can crowd out popular discourse with active self-promotion.

Art and Outrage: Provocation, Controversy and the Avant-garde. , London: Pluto, 1999 page 83 Kelly has contributed extensively to the discourse of feminism and postmodernism through her large-scale narrative installations and theoretical writings. Kelly's work mediates between conceptual art and the more intimate interests of artists of the 1980s. Her work has been exhibited internationally and she is considered among the most influential contemporary artists working today. Kelly is Judge Widney Professor at the USC Roski School of Art and Design of the University of Southern California. She was previously Professor of Art at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she was Head of Interdisciplinary Studio, an area she initiated for artists engaged in site-specific, collective, and project based work. She was interviewed about her experience teaching at UCLA in Sarah Thornton's Seven Days in the Art World. Work Mary Kelly is known for her project-based work in the form of large-scale narrative installations. Her projects constructed in the 1970s are preoccupied with her experiences of pregnancy and child raising. Antepartum (1973), a single shot of the artist stroking her abdomen as her unborn baby moves, and Post-Partum Document (1973‚Äì79), a six part project using both personal and theoretical elements to document the mother-child relationship, were created in the same year. First shown at the ICA in London 1976, Post-Partum Document was made up of six sections and 135 smaller units ‚Äî accompanied by a number of essays and footnotes ‚Äî consisting of different objects from Kelly's new born son's life. The work tracks in detail everything that her son did, from eating to expelling and maintains a diary of the artist's thoughts. Post-Partum Document collected used liners from the inside of his cloth diapers, feeding charts, and speech events documented by Kelly. Each documentation is made out of distinct and carefully thought-out materials. Documentation I, for example, incorporated six used liners from Kelly's son's cloth diapers paired with her written text. This unusual subject matter caused outrage and controversy at the debut exhibition because some viewers believed that displaying excrement on used diapers at an art gallery was not appropriate. Documentation III is a transcription of conversations with her child, her internal speech as a mother, and locating the conversation within a specific time interval. Her child's drawing on top of the careful, meticulous documentation emphasizes the interactive nature of the series and the fact that the relationship between a child and their mother can be \\"difficult and complex\\" instead of solely sentimental. In this series, Kelly adapts over time as a mother along with her child. Documentation VI is a Rosetta Stone-like tablet with text recording the process of Kelly's son learning to write and other milestone life events that were seemingly mundane, but important to the development of the relationship between Kelly and her son. According to art historian Lucy Lippard, Post- Partum Document \\"outlines social interference into the 'ideal' relationship of mother and child (or artist and object) in terms of desire, presence and absence.\\" For Lippard, and other art historians, this project must be considered within a feminist discourse of consciousness-raising, collaborative work, and discussions about sexual division of labor. Kelly created this work during the second-wave of feminism that focused on ways women worked in the home. Post-Partum Document is a notable work of feminist art because it is a relevant depiction of the meaning of motherhood for contemporary women. Additionally, Post-Partum Document deploys a distanced and seemingly objective look at being a mother and discusses the creation of subjectivity, something many of the male artists during Kelly's time avoided. Throughout the 1980s and into the present day, Kelly's projects continue to engage with questions posed by theoretical practice and subjectivity. In her monumental work, Interim (1984‚Äì89), Kelly deals with collective memories of women. Its object is to specify the discourses that define and regulate feminine identities.Sandler, Irving. Art of the Post Modern Era, New York: Harper Collins, 1996, p 400. Despite the absence of female bodies in this project, Emily Apter writes that clothing in Interim, as well as Kelly's other projects, shows that \\"representation and exemplarity are guaranteed by the jackets in bondage.\\" Another project Gloria Patri (1992), draws on an archive of found material from the first Gulf War to question how the violence of international events affects or is affected by individual lives.Bonham, Charlotte, and David Hodge.The Contemporary Art Book, London: Goodman, an imprint of Carlton Publishing Group, 2009. Page 129 In the Ballad of Kastriot Rexhepi (2001), panels of lint, formed in a domestic dryer, are joined together to form undulating waves that tell the story of a child abandoned during the war in Kosovo. Art historian Griselda Pollock wrote that this \\"pattern of repeat and inversion evokes both a visual register of sound waves and images of pulse and flow as well as recalling the structure of biological life, the helix.\\" Ultimately, Pollock situates this project as an intersection between the material as both virtual and indexical. The Ballad of Kastriot Rechepi then \\"evokes the photographic visual effect while yet bearing no image, and staging no sight again performs a constant Kelly move: to stage in a created art work a commentary on the modes of seeing and knowledge typical of our cultures and media, one face of our creation through the interface with these signifying systems as social subjects.\\" As part of this work, Kelly commissioned the composer, Michael Nyman to create a score for the ballad that was performed by soprano Sarah Leonard and the Nyman Quartet at the opening of the exhibition at the Santa Monica Museum of Art.Kraus,Chris, Jan Tumlir, and Jans McFadden. LA Artland, London: Black Dog Publishing, 2005, p 103. In 2004, Kelly created a piece called Circa 1968. This set of works brings back the movement of the 1968 demonstration by university students in Paris. Similar to the Ballad of Kastriot Rexhepi, the piece is composed of dryer lint and required over 10,000 loads of laundry to acquire enough lint to produce. The installation is projected onto the wall to bring about questions of the reoccurring past, the future and the legacy that these events will hold. For Love Songs (2005), Kelly enlisted the help of young women interested in the philosophies and legacies of the women's movement to restage historical photographs of protests some thirty years after they were taken. Her ‚Äúremixes‚Äù are just approximate enough to allow for real differences between versions, but similar enough to suggest literal and metaphorical continuities.Burton,Johanna.

He joined Saxony's Infantry Regiment Nr. 2 just before World War I. In 1913, he learned to fly at Anthony Fokker's flying school. As one of the very few experienced pilots about, he was serving in Flieger-Abteilung (Flier Detachment) 64 when the war began. He then moved on to service in FA 23 and then to artillery direction with Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie) 221. On 10 August 1916, he transferred to fighter aviation with his assignment to KEK Bertincourt. When Jagdstaffel 1 was founded as one of the original dedicated German fighter squadrons later in August, Hahn joined them. On 10 November, he would both succeed to acting squadron commander and score his first aerial victory. On 29 November 1916, he transferred to command of Jagdstaffel 19. Having already won both classes of the Iron Cross, he accepted the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Saint Henry on 29 December 1916. Hahn was the first fighter pilot to receive the Saint Henry. He would not score again until April, when he downed three enemy airplanes and two observation balloons. Notable among these wins was his fourth victory, when he downed French ace Ren√© Doumer. On 1 May, Erich Hahn was awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. After these six confirmed victories, Hahn led his squadron until 1935 hours 4 September 1917. At that time, French ace, Lieutenant Georges Madon shot him down over Beine, France and killed him.

It was part of a branch of the Great Eastern Railway which ran from March to Watlington. The line closed in the 1960s, but a recent idea by the Wisbech and March Bramley Line to restore the line between Wisbech and March may see trains return to route in some form. However, the organisation would need to raise ¬£10,000 to acquire the lease of the line and then set about repairing it to the required railways inspectorate standard. Additional funds to build this and other stations would then need to be raised by the small number of volunteers. No detailed costings for the additional work are available. Elm Road has never had a station before, and this would be the southern terminus to begin with. It is the intention in years to come, to try to get Heritage services into the disused platforms at March Station.

The site was first excavated by Waldo Wedel of the US National Museum in 1937. He discovered decorated pottery styles typical of Hopewell pottery. It was excavated for a second time in 1954 by the Kansas City Archaeological Society and a third time by Gary Brenner from 1980 to 1993. During the summer of 2009 the site was the subject of local controversy over the building of a new playground at the location. The city council of Riverside listened to testimony from archaeologists and local residents and decided to pay for rescue excavations at the site.

Woese Institute for Genomic Biology and National Academy of Sciences member. He pioneered the application of genomics to the study of social behavior and led the effort to sequence the honey bee genome. On February 10, 2009, his research was famously featured in an episode of The Colbert Report whose eponymous host referred to the honey Dr. Robinson sent him as \\"pharmaceutical-grade hive jive\\". Life and education After acquiring his bachelor's in biology from Cornell University, Robinson went on to earn his Ph.D in entomology from Cornell in 1986. He joined the faculty of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1989. Currently, Robinson is the Director of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the University of Illinois and a Swanlund and Center for Advanced Study Professor of Entomology, with affiliate appointments in the Neuroscience Program, the Department of Cell & Developmental Biology, the Program in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology, and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. Work and discoveries Authoring or co-authoring over 250 publications, Robinson has made a wide range of fundamental advances in understanding the endocrine, neural, and genetic regulation of behavior at the individual and colony levels in honey bees. His discoveries have significantly advanced the understanding of the role of genes, hormones, and neurochemicals in the mechanisms and evolution of social behavior. Robinson‚Äôs lab discovered the first gene known to be involved in regulating the bee colony‚Äôs famous division of labor, and in 2002 published this in Science. (reported in NY Times, Washington Post, German Public Radio, South African Public Radio, Genome News Network; included in Perspectives of Animal Behavior 3rd ed., Goodenough et al.; Animal Behavior, Alcock) The very next year, Robinson‚Äôs lab was the first to show that social information causes mass changes in brain gene expression, also publishing this in Science. (reported in Reuters, CNN.com, St. Louis Dispatch, Wall Street Journal, Belgium De Standaard; included in Perspectives of Animal Behavior 3rd ed., Goodenough et al.; Animal Behavior, Alcock) Robinson‚Äôs discovery on social regulation of brain gene expression has had a profound effect on understanding the roots of behavior. He developed a new paradigm to address the age-old ‚Äúnature-nurture‚Äù problem, which was published in 2004 in an essay in Science and an Op-Ed in the New York Times.Robinson, G.E. 2004. The behavior of genes. New York Times Op-Ed, 13 December In October 2006, a collection of biologists, led by Robinson, successfully published the sequence of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, together with the Baylor Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC). This discovery spurred an explosion of new bee research in molecular biology and genomics. More recently, Robinson was part of a team that has discovered a plausible cause of colony collapse disorder, a malady that in 2007-2008 killed off more than one third of commercial honey bees in the U.S. By analyzing differences in gene expression between healthy and infected honey bees, researchers learned that bees in CCD hives have unusually high levels of fragmented ribosomal RNA, a symptom of infection with multiple viruses.

A Buddhist, he was noted for his immense work in building monasteries, palaces and shrines in Ladakh and is known as the \\"Lion King\\". Biography Sengge was born to Jamyang Namgyal and a Muslim mother. He was a devout Buddhist. In 1610, during the reign of his father, Jamyang Namgyal, Sengge and his father built the Basgo Monastery and erected a 24-foot statue of Maitreya within it and a 32-foot Buddha statue which is reportedly the second largest Buddhist statue in Ladakh after the statue in Shey Palace. In his youth, he showed great martial skill and a flair for command. Talents which got him the command of the army. In 1614, he captured the mining town of Rudok followed by Spurangs, another important gold mining town, in 1615. The plunder and the output from these towns financed the building projects he would later commission as the King. In 1616, on the death of his father, Jamyang Namgyal, he ascended to the throne. He completed the conquests of Kingdom of Ngaris after a brief siege of Guge castle in 1619. Trade flourished under Namgyal along the Silk Road and he generated much wealth through trade with Kashmir to the west, and with Tibet to the east. However, he occasionally fell into dispute with the Muslim rulers of Kashmir. Hanle Gompa, built by Sengge and Stag-tsang-ras-pa, soon after his conversion to the Drugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism During his reign, Sengge was responsible for building or renovating some of the most notable buildings in the region such as the Leh Palace, which he built after moving from Shey Palace/Monastery, and he built the Hemis monastery in 1630. With the assistance of the eminent Tibetan priest, Stag-tsang-ras-pa, he built the Hanle Monastery and was the first to be associated with the Drugpa school that Stag-tsang-ras-pa belonged to and which, under the patronage of the Namgyal family, became very important in Ladakh, seriously rivaling the reformed (\\"Yellow Hat\\") Gelug sect.Ladakh: Crossroads of High Asia. Second Edition. (1996), pp. 67-68. Janet Rizvi. Oxford University Press, New Delhi. . Sengge was also responsible for renovating the Golden Temple of Tabo Monastery in the Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh which was said to have been once covered with gold. The walls and ceilings are covered with murals today. Death and legacy Sengge remained devoted to the Ralung lineage of the Drukpa Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism after meeting the Tibetan priest for the remainder of his life. He died in 1642 at Hanle on his return from an expedition against the Mongols who had occupied the Tibetan province of Tsang and were threatening Ladakh.Ladakh: Crossroads of High Asia.

The motel's building is one of the few remaining examples of post-World War II motel architecture in Miami and the only example in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood. The property has been featured as an architecturally significant structure in the book on MiMo architecture MiMo: Miami Modern Revealed. History and design The Creek South Beach (originally named The Ankara Motel) was built in 1954 by the architecture firm of Reiff & Feldman. Designed in a classic motel or googie-style \\"L\\" shape, \\"the central element is a radically cantilevered-raked delta-wing roof, perched lightly as a paper airplane atop a triangular glass lobby.\\" The lobby design sets the tone for architectural elements throughout ‚Äì zigzagged lines, floating staircases encased in brick and a central pylon overlooking the waterway. The popularity of the property rose and fell with Miami Beach's economic tides changing hands and names many times over. By the turn of the 21st century, the motel was operated as a youth hostel under the name of Banana Bungalow and suffered from severe neglect and poor maintenance. In 2003, the property was purchased by Ken Fields, who renamed it The Creek South Beach and turned the motel into the first art hotel on Miami Beach. Young artists from across the country were invited to design individual rooms, re-christened The Creek: Signature Series. The project managers for the Signature Series were Bo Sundius of Bunch Design and Tim Ronan of SBK Global, with curatorial input and coordinator of artists' installations from artist Ellen Jong.

Over these few weeks, armies of the competing archbishops of Cologne burned the southernmost villages, cloisters, and small towns. It the Cologne War (1583‚Äì1589) two men competed for control of the Electorate of Cologne and sought to control one of the wealthiest Electorates in the Holy Roman Empire. Their contest lasted until 1589, when Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg renounced his claim and moved to Strassbourg; Ernst of Bavaria became uncontested Prince elector of Cologne, the first Wittelsbach to hold the position; his family maintained their hold on it until 1761. Under his direction, Jesuits introduced the Counter- Reformation to the north-western German states and under the leadership of his successors, these territories remained a Catholic stronghold until the late eighteenth century. Context In this phase of the war, it was a localized feud between supporters of Gebhard, and supporters of the Catholic core of the Cathedral chapter. In the initial outburst after Gebhard's conversion, several of the key men of the Electorate had taken sides. Salentin von Isenburg and his son in law, Count Arenberg, and the Duke Frederick of Saxe-Lauenburg stood against the supporters of Gebhard Truchsess. Gebhard had three primary supporters: his brother, Karl, Truchsess von Waldburg (1548‚Äì1593), who had married Eleonore, Countess of Hohenzollern (1551‚Äìafter 1598); his longtime ally and supporter Count Adolph Neuenar and Herman Neuenar, a member of the Cathedral chapter, and Neuenar's brother-in-law, Count Bentheim.

Campaign for the Upper Electorate Karl Truchsess, the Elector's brother, burned the Dietkirchen cloister to the ground.Hennes, p. 64. Initially, in the Oberstift, Salentin von Isenburg took the cities of Linz (Linz am Rhein) and Ahrweiler and the district of Altenrath for the Catholic faction. The count Werner von of Reifferscheid, who was the hereditary marshal of the Archdiocese, took command of the Catholic faction's troops. He occupied Bonn, and the castle at Alfter. All the villages and cloisters that lay there, he plundered and set to the torch. Reifferscheid overran Bonn and then took the village of Mehlem, from there he went to a powder supply that Karl Truchsess had established in the vicinity of the city, and took it, and then burned the facility. In the night, overran Bonn by the village of Mehlem. After that, in the middle of the night, he overcame the sentries, and overcame the enemy in deep sleep.Hennes, p. 65. There passed a dreadful carnage. On both sides were the deaths enough. All of the villages by the Rhine were burned. There were dreadful crackling and glow in the deep night. Everything was destroyed, what the one side didn't burn, the other side did. The victor moved toward Bonn and took it in Triumph. Attack on Neuwied and Onckel Siege of Poppelsdorf In November 1583, Ernst's brother laid siege to the Elector's palace at Poppelsdorf. A gothic water fortress had been built in 1341 and was expanded the following year into a double-fortress. Despite its relatively low walls, it held out for two weeks, and Ernst's troops breached the gates on 18 November. Ernst's troops enter the double fortress at Poppelsdorf November 1583.

The church was plundered and the priests abused and mishandled.  Consequences  At this point, on 22 March, in Rome, Pope Gregory XIII excommunicated Gebhard. He declared him alienated from all his possessions, funds, and everything to which he was entitled, including services of people who had promised loyalty to him.Hennes, p. 74. During this early part of the war, the two factions became more clearly defined and from either side, the lines became clearer: if you are not for us, you are against us. It was not possible to remain neutral.

Marriages and issue Although it is likely that Donal IV was Catholic, as he was a member of the House of Commons of the James II Parliament in 1689 and subsequently outlawed, neither of his wives was Gaelic. This may have contributed to his success in avoiding confiscation of his remaining lands. From his tenure his branch made a massive shift to anglicize and conform, inevitably ruining their reputation (which was already low due to his grandfather's surrender and re-grant of clan lands) but which facilitated their retention of property during the Penal Laws. He was first married to Victoria Copinger, daughter of Captain Walter Copinger of Cloghan, by whom he had a daughter, Helena, who married her 2nd cousin Conn (Cornelius) O'Donovan of Montpellier, ancestor of the present O'Donovan, Lord of Clancahill.

Biography Hall was born in Grangemouth, the youngest son of William Hall of Helensburgh. He was educated at the Hermitage School, Dunoon Grammar School, and Hillhead High School, Glasgow, after which he worked in the office of the chartered accountants Paterson & Benzie. In October 1914 he enlisted into the 17th (Glasgow Commercials) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, as a private. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 9th (The Dumbartonshire) Battalion of the Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) regiment on 17 April 1915, and was sent to France in July. Hall was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps with the rank of lieutenant on 1 December 1916. After completing his pilot training he was posted to No. 57 Squadron in France, flying the DH.4 two-seater day bomber. He was appointed a flight commander with the acting- rank of captain on 18 June 1917. On 27 July he and observer/gunner 2nd Lieutenant N. M. Pizey drove down an Albatros D.V out of control over Houthulst Forest, though Pizey was killed in the action. Hall was then paired with Lieutenant Britton, who was wounded by \\"friendly fire\\" from a French SPAD over Ypres on 20 August. On 2 October, Hall, with 2nd Lieutenant Edward Patrick Hartigan, led a flight of five DH.4s on a bombing attack on the enemy aerodrome at Abeele. On their return they were attacked by Albatros D.V fighters over Roeselare. In the \\"confused\\" action that followed Hall and Hartigan claimed four D.Vs shot down, and probable hits on at least six others. Two DH.4s were shot down and their crews killed, and a third crash- landed in enemy territory, killing the observer, while the pilot was captured. On 26 November, following this action, Hall was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: :Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) David Sidney Hall, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. While leading back his formation of five machines from a bombing raid he was attacked on eight different occasions by numerous enemy scouts. He himself shot down one in flames and another out of control, while his observer shot down two in flames. He has at all times, completed the task allotted to him, and set a splendid example.\\" Hall and Hartigan drove down another D.V on 28 October, west of Roeselare. On the morning of 20 November, the first day of the battle of Cambrai, they set off alone on a weather reconnaissance mission, but did not return. The wreckage of their aircraft was discovered later in the day near Les Alleux, Ardennes. Hall and Hartigan are buried together in the Longuenesse Souvenir Cemetery at Saint-Omer, France.

She is well known for her work on the cultural ecology of Panama, and more recently in the Casamance region of Southern Senegal. She is also concerned with the social organization of agrarian systems as well as the relationship between \\"ecology, political economy, migration and the changing dynamics of food production among rural peoples living in tropical regions\\".Smithsonian Family Olga Linares was born November 10, 1936 in the city of David, Panama,International Who's Who of Women (Sleeman 2001: 333) the daughter of Francisco (Frank) Esteban Linares and Olga Tribaldos de Linares.,Linares 1968b: viii She married her second husband Martin Moynihan, founding director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) and animal behaviorist, in 1973. Moynihan passed away on December 3, 1996. After having been widowed for many years, Linares married Fenwick ‚ÄúFen‚Äù C. Riley in 2006 and lived in Panama until their deaths a few months apart in 2014. Educational background and training Basic education Linares received her B.A. in Anthropology from Vassar College in 1958 and later completed her Ph.D. in anthropology from Harvard University in 1964. Career related Linares served as an instructor of anthropology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1964 and a lecturer of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia from 1966 to 1971. She also was a visiting associate professor at the University of Texas, Austin in 1974. Linares worked as a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study at Stanford University in California, from 1979 to 1980 and as a visiting professor in 1982. Later she was a fellow at St. John's overseas at Cambridge University in England from 1986 to 1987. In 2002 she was a trustee for the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute in Rome in 2002. Linares retired in 2008 as senior research scientist at STRI, after an association at the institute lasting some 35 years. She retained status as scientist emerita with the STRI scientific faculty.Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute 2008: 2 Principal archaeological research projects Lower Central America Linares began her career as an archaeologist mainly focused on studying lower Central America, in particular Panama. In part, her research was an effort to bring to light the validity or invalidity of popular assumptions that this region served solely as a corridor between Mesoamerica and South America. She deduced that historically, there were populations that lived, hunted and farmed in these regions, and that it was not merely a pathway connecting Central America to South America.Linares 1979: 21-22 One of Linares' earliest ventures was exploring occupation sequences in the Gulf of Chiriqui in central Panama from AD 300 to the 'Classic' Chiriqu√≠ Province culture. This was the first effort to establish a chronology of the Chiriqui based on stratified refuge deposits. She did this by studying changing ceramic techniques of four excavation sites in the region which presented a sequence of occupation which she then related to other central Panamanian provinces and in Costa Rica.Linares 1968a: 216 Linares later studied 'adaptive radiation' in prehistoric populations in Western Panama. To do this, she looked at the archaeological evidence of two differing environments present at the same time, one humid while the other was more seasonal, to explain the divergence of a people with a single origin. Related to the different environments was the emergence of different agricultural practices: vegeculture versus seed culture. By looking at what may have happened when an ancient population migrated and colonized a new territory, Linares is essentially developing theories of patterns of the peopling of the Americas.Linares 1977: 304 Linares also examined \\"Ecology and the arts in ancient Panama.\\" During this research she studied the culture and art of ancient populations of the central provinces of Panama. Much of her research was done at Sitio Conte where she collected artifacts in order to better understand the 'meaning and function' of the arts. This included a study of trade practices and social structures of power during the 16th century of the Cocle and Cuna cultures.Linares 1977 Senegal From the 1980s until present, Linares began extensive research in the Casamance region of Southern Senegal, the region located below the Gambia. More specifically, this research focused on social organizations and food production of the Jola people (also spelled Diola.) She looks at the varying techniques of wet rice production and compares them with different modes of cultivation in the region. She also examines how social organization shapes these differing methods.Linares 1981: 557 One example of this is the role gender plays in the production of cash crops versus subsistence crops. Here, she looks at the effects of colonial influence on the practices of the Jola, and how traditional cultivation differs from modern cultivation of crops purely for export.Linares 1985: 83-84 In addition to rural food cultivation practices, Linares explores a new form that she refers to as \\"urban farming\\" that has developed in the age of post-colonialism. With much migration to larger cities, traditional practices of subsistence growing have led to backyard farming in urban areas, providing not only another source of food, but also a way to maintain and strengthen friendship, \\"inter-ethnic\\" cooperation, as well as to enrich the environment.Linares 1996: 104 Furthermore, she discusses the role the government has played in agricultural failures due to drought in the Basse Casamance region. According to Linares, drought and other uncontrollable factors are not the sole reason for subpar agricultural performance, but also the state's inability to respond effectively and appropriately to these environmental stresses.Linares 2005: 230-231 Awards and memberships Grantee National Science Foundation, 1965, 1970‚Äî73 Fellow: American Association for the Advancement of Science; mem.: National Academy of Sciences, Royal Anthropology Institute, Am.

In January 2010 the Campaign participated in a protest at CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, against drone attacks. After the disastrous floods in Pakistan in August 2010, CPD circulated an appeal by the Sindh Labour Relief Committee, including 14 Pakistani unions and progressive organizations, for financial aid to the flood victims.CPD website, \\"Urgent Pakistani Labor Appeal for Emergency Flood Support.\\" The Campaign also posted a statement on the floods' political context by the Labour Party Pakistan and the National Trade Union Federation.The Campaign also posted a statement on the floods' political context by the Labour Party Pakistan and the National Trade Union Federation. In October 2010 CPD issued a sign-on statement, \\"End the War Threats and Sanctions Program Against Iran: Support the Struggle for Democracy Inside Iran.\\" In December 2010 the Campaign declared its support for the work of Wikileaks,Julian Assange, and Bradley (later Chelsea) Manning, which revealed the cynical manipulation of other countries by the U.S. government. CPD enthusiastically welcomed the beginning of Arab Spring with the statement, \\"We Support the Democratic Revolution in Tunisia\\" on Jan. 16, 2011. A month later, CPD hailed the Egyptian uprising in the statement \\"Egypt After Mubarak\\" (Feb. 14), which also warned against the continuing power of the Egyptian military and elements of the old regime and called for the completion of the democratic revolution. As part of its ongoing work on behalf of the democratic movement in Iran, the Campaign led a delegation of peace and human rights activists in a visit to the U.S. and Iranian missions to the UN on Feb. 24, arguing with officials there that both U.S. war threats and sanctions program and Iranian repression should be ended. CPD opposed NATO intervention in Libya (\\"We support the Libyan Democratic Revolution and Oppose Western Intervention and Domination,\\" April 16, 2011) and played an active role in building solidarity with the democratic opposition in Bahrain. The CPD statement, \\"End U.S. Support for Bahrain's Oppressive Government,\\" which included hundreds of Bahraini signatures, was published in The Nation (June 6) and the New York Review of Books online (June 9). After Israeli soldiers on the Syrian border fired on Palestinian demonstrators in May, CPD issued a statement condemning \\"Israel's Murderous Attack on Unarmed Palestinians\\" (June 9). As the Arab Spring continued, the Campaign declared its ardent support for Syrian democrats: \\"CPD Salutes Syria's Courageous Democratic Movement\\" (June 9). In response to the savage violence of the Assad regime, CPD released both a \\"Message of Condolence and Solidarity From U.S. Peace Activists to the Syrian People\\" and an \\"Open Letter to the Syrian Government in Protest Against the Death of Non-Violent Activist Ghayath Mattar and Brutal Repression of Syrian Democratic Activists\\" (Sept. 16, 2011).  Founding  The group was founded in 1982 as the Campaign for Peace and Democracy/East and West (CPD/EW) by Joanne Landy and Gail Daneker. Its initial inspiration was the emergence of the independent Polish trade union movement Solidarnosc (Solidarity), and the massive upsurge of opposition to nuclear weapons represented by the nuclear freeze movement in the United States and the European Nuclear Disarmament (END) movement, which protested NATO deployment of cruise and Pershing missiles. CPD/EW was formed around a perspective of independence from both Cold War blocs; it dedicated itself to helping build a third alternative based on popular struggles for peace, human rights and social justice.‚ÄúWelcome to our Readers,‚Äù Peace and Democracy News, Vol. I No. 1 (Spring 1984)  D√©tente From Below  Embracing the idea of ‚Äúd√©tente from below,\\" first articulated by British historian and peace activist E.P. Thompson, the Campaign insisted that lasting peace could not be achieved by relying on existing governments, with their own elite realpolitik agendas, but only by alliances of grassroots movements working across frontiers. In particular, CPD/EW strove to forge links among the Western anti-missile movements of the early 1980s, the U.S. anti-intervention movements then opposing the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, and Soviet bloc dissidents. CPD became widely known for its direct contacts with East-bloc activists, and provided many U.S. peace groups with the opportunity to meet them and support their democratic struggles.  Peace and Democracy News  In the spring of 1984, CPD/EW published the first issue of its magazine, Peace and Democracy News; it printed a speech by Daniel Singer, the European correspondent for The Nation and author of books on Polish Solidarity, \\"A Plague on Both Their Houses\\",Peace and Democracy News, Vol. I No. 1 (Spring 1984) which had been delivered at a CPD/EW forum entitled \\"In Solidarity With the Right to Rebel: Spotlight on Chile and Poland\\"; the forum had also featured the Chilean playwright and novelist Ariel Dorfman.

Core Principles  Until 1995, when Peace and Democracy ceased publication and a decline in funding and popular support for a peace movement forced the organization into temporary dormancy, the Campaign (which changed its name to the Campaign for Peace and Democracy in 1990 to reflect the end of the Cold War) continued to mount campaigns, organize conferences and issue statements based on its core principles: opposition to nuclear weapons and military intervention, withdrawal of U.S. troops and bases from all foreign countries, an end to U.S. support for authoritarian states, and international economic policies to combat poverty based on aid and development aimed at popular rather than corporate needs.  1980s  Throughout the 1980s CPD insisted that independent peace and human rights groups in the Soviet bloc, not government-controlled \\"peace councils,\\" were the genuine allies of Western peace movements.Landy, Joanne, ‚ÄúOfficial Peace Councils and the Non-Aligned Peace Movement, Peace and Democracy News, Vol.III No.1 (Winter-Spring 1988) It drew up joint statements by peace and human rights activists from both sides of the Cold War divide condemning the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile,‚ÄúEast- West Declaration Calls for an End to U.S.-Backed Loans to Pinochet‚Äôs Chile,‚Äù Peace and Democracy News, Vol.III No.1 (Winter-Spring 1988).

Andrew's Church is the Church of England parish church of Tarring, West Sussex, England. Founded in the 11th century in a then rural parish which had earlier been granted to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the church remained a peculier of Canterbury for many centuries thereafter. It served nearby parishes when their churches fell into disrepair, John Selden was baptised here, and the church became a base for smuggling. The present building is mostly 13th-century, and its tall spire is a landmark in the area. The church is a Grade II* Listed Building. History The parish of West Tarring is now part of the Borough of Worthing, but has ancient origins as a South Downs strip parish of about . It ran for about from its northern extremity at Bost Hill, on the track to Findon (now the A24 road), to the English Channel coast in the south, and was much narrower apart from a thin strip of land extending westwards. Many coastal parishes in Sussex were this shape: many different soils and varieties of land would be included within the boundaries, from chalky downland in the north to marshy grassland near the coast. Two settlements developed, of which West Tarring was the larger and more central. (The name \\"Tarring\\" was, and still is, also used, but the \\"West\\" prefix was often used to prevent confusion with Tarring Neville near Lewes.) Salvington, the other settlement in the parish, is high on the slopes of the South Downs. The first documented description of West Tarring was in about AD 939, when King Athelstan granted the manor of Tarring to Christ Church in Canterbury (now Canterbury Cathedral). At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 it was still held by the archbishop and had 41 inhabitants. A church is known to have existed at that time; it is likely to have been a wooden building. The present flint and stone building began to take shape in the mid-13th century. At that time, the rector, Simon of Tarring, provided sanctuary for Richard of Wych (later St Richard of Chichester), the new Bishop of Chichester. He had been barred from his own palace there by King Henry III, who had been angered by the election of Richard as bishop in place of Robert Passelewe. While he was based at the church, Richard travelled throughout Sussex, taking services and reputedly performing miracles; he was canonised in 1262. The dedication to Saint Andrew was first mentioned in 1372. In the 15th century the chancel and tower were rebuilt, apparently under the influence of Canterbury. The rood screen also dates from that time. The church only had modest wealth ‚Äî its internal fittings were valued at ¬£6.13s.4d. (¬£ as of ) in 1561 ‚Äî and unusual fundraising activities were popular. Church ales ‚Äî drinking sessions held in the church, at which the churchwardens sold beer to raise funds for its upkeep ‚Äî were popular throughout the 16th century, and often proved to be uproarious occasions at which large quantities of luxurious food were eaten and various entertainers performed. An organ was installed in the late 16th century. Bells were hung in the tower by 1518, and there were five in 1533. These had been cast at the Tapsel (or Topsell) family's bell foundry near the church; the Tapsels cast many bells in West Tarring, for churches across Sussex, for about 200 years, and also invented the Tapsel gate used in some Sussex churchyards. The nearby parishes of Durrington and Heene had been linked to West Tarring since the Middle Ages. Their tithes were combined, and they were administered for ecclesiastical purposes by the incumbents of St Andrew's: for example, burials and baptisms were carried out at West Tarring. By the 17th century, in common with many churches in the area, Durrington and Heene's churches had declined and fallen into ruin. By 1680 both were in such poor condition that their parishioners were allowed to travel to worship at St Andrew's instead, and services were no longer held at Durrington or Heene. The early 20th- century lychgate, with the spire of the church behind Major changes were made in the mid-19th century. In 1845 the church ceased to be a peculier of Canterbury and instead was placed under the Diocese of Chichester, in conformity with other Church of England churches in the area. In 1853 the vicar instigated a restoration of the church, raising most of the ¬£2,200 (¬£ as of ) himself. Changes included the removal of the timber west gallery, the addition of a vestry, the stripping of previous interior alterations and a complete overhaul of the interior (although certain fittings were retained and reinstalled), and the replacement of the organ. Also in 1853 Charles and George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast four of the bells into a new ring of six. The restoration took seven months and was completed in time for Holy Week 1854. In 1885 mosaics designed by the Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield were installed by Italian craftsmen in the aisles and around the tower arch. The church roof partly collapsed around the same time and had to be repaired. In the 20th century a lychgate was erected at the churchyard entrance, the reredos was replaced, the organ was replaced again, the roof of the chancel was renewed and some stained glass was added. The font was replaced with a Victorian one: the main section of its medieval predecessor was removed and taken to Australia by the Henty family when they emigrated. The Hentys were successful farmers, especially of merino sheep, and lived in one of West Tarring's largest houses. Thomas Henty, the patriarch, sent three of his sons and 150 sheep to Western Australia in 1829. Eventually the whole family moved to Australia: the pioneers settled in Tasmania, while Edward Henty, another son, became the first settler in Victoria and was instrumental in developing the sheep-rearing industry there. They gave the font they had taken with them to a cathedral in Melbourne, which some sources state is St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne while the Sussex Parish Churches website states this was at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, the architect of which, William Butterfield had previously worked at St Andrew's Church. Smuggling was popular in the Worthing area between the early 18th and early 19th centuries ‚Äî sometimes out of necessity, such as during a period of economic hardship in the 1820s which caused the developing town to stagnate. One of the leading smugglers at that time, William Cowerson, was employed at St Andrew's Church on restoration work; he regularly used the table tombs in the churchyard to store smuggled alcohol and other contraband. Building St Andrew's Church is an Early English Gothic building with some Perpendicular Gothic elements. It is a knapped flint structure with stone dressings, and is relatively large in comparison with others in the area‚Äîprobably because of the influence of Canterbury. The nave survives in its entirety from the 13th century. It has five bays with aisles, a clerestory, a vestry on the south side and porches on the north and south sides. The aisles and clerestory have lancet windows, and the whole composition is in the Early English style. The chancel and tower were rebuilt in the 15th century in the Perpendicular style, and the tall octagonal shingled spire was added in the 16th century. The chancel has Perpendicular-style windows with two lights; some of the tower windows more closely resemble the earlier Decorated Gothic style. The east window of the chancel is more ornate than usual: paired shorter lights flank a much taller central light which is surrounded at the top by sexfoils (six- lobed circular openings). The tower and chancel have buttresses with quoins and dressings of ashlar. The tower also has an interior stair-turret in one corner. Its west door, in the Perpendicular style with a hood mould, is not original: it was inserted in the late 15th century. The windows above it have elaborate tracery. Paul Chapman of Hove-based stained glass designers Cox & Barnard made windows for the west ends of the north and south aisles. They were installed in 1958 and depict Saint Thomas of Canterbury and Saint Richard of Chichester respectively. Inside, there are five pointed arches on each side of the nave, with round columns topped by capitals. The mosaic decoration, depicting the Twelve Apostles, runs between and above them, and extends to the tower arch with its octagonal columns. The chancel arch was restored in the mid-19th century, but the 15th-century chancel screen was retained during the renovations of 1853. Also in the chancel are six misericords, two with carved heads. There are several memorials in the church. The Henty family is commemorated by a tablet and a 19th-century window near the altar; there is also a window for Robert Southey, the poet, who was the father-in-law of the vicar (Reverend J. Warter) who had restored the church in the mid-19th century. The most famous man associated with St Andrew's Church, John Selden, was baptised here in 1584 and has a memorial and a plaque. The church today St Andrew's Parish Church has been a Grade II* Listed Building since 11 October 1949. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important\\" and \\"of more than special interest\\". As of February 2001 it was one of eight Grade II* listed buildings in the borough of Worthing. Today the ecclesiastical parish is smaller than the ancient parish, but the northern part up to Salvington is retained. The other boundaries are the railway line to the south, The Boulevard in the west and a line west of Loxwood Avenue to the east.

He disappeared while attempting the first non-stop east-west flight across the Atlantic Ocean. His Fokker F.VIIa, named St. Raphael, was last seen over the mid-Atlantic by oil tanker SS Josiah Macy. World War I service Hamilton was commissioned into the Corps of Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant on 12 June 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant on 12 December 1917, and having transferred to the Royal Flying Corps to train as a pilot, was appointed a flying officer on 17 January 1918. Hamilton was posted to No. 17 Squadron stationed in Salonika, Greece, flying a SE.5a. His first victory was on 21 April and was shared with fellow ace Acheson Goulding. After No. 17 Squadron was merged with No. 47 Squadron to form No. 150 Squadron, Hamilton scored five more wins. The four triumphs he notched between 4 May and 4 September were shared with other aces, such as Gerald Gibbs, Frederick Travers, and Gerald Gordon Bell. Hamilton's sixth and last win, on 18 September 1918, was a solo one.Shores et.al. (1990). He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted in February 1919. His citation read: :Lieutenant Leslie Hamilton. (Salonika) ::A gallant and skilful scout pilot who never hesitates to attack enemy formations, however superior in numbers. During recent operations he has rendered exceptional service. He has himself brought down, or assisted to bring down, six enemy machines. Post war RAF career Hamilton was granted a short-service commission in the RAF on 24 October 1919, but relinquished both his temporary and short service commissions at his own request on 28 November, and was transferred to unemployed list. However, he soon returned to RAF service, being granted another short service commission on 14 July 1920 with the rank of flying officer. On 2 July 1921 he married Barbara Webber of Maidenhead, Berkshire. In 1922 he was serving in No. 24 Squadron, based at Kenley, and in June he took part in the 3rd RAF Aerial Pageant at Hendon Aerodrome, coming second in a race between Avro 504s, and with the rest his squadron giving a demonstration of formation flying in Bristol Fighters. In September the same year he took part in the first King's Cup Race, flying an Airco DH.9C belonging to Lady Anne Savile (Princess Loewenstein-Wertheim), who flew with him as a passenger. They came sixth. In the June 1923 King's Birthday Honours he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire. In July he took part in the Fourth RAF Aerial Pageant, again taking part in the Avro 504 race, and again coming second. He was granted a permanent commission in the RAF on 5 September. In July 1924 he took part on the Fifth RAF Aerial Pageant, as part of team representing Kenley in an aerial relay race. Each team consisted of an Avro 504, a Bristol Fighter and a Sopwith Snipe, with Hamilton flying the Avro in the winning team. No. 24 Squadron mounted another Aerial Pageant at Kenley in a week later organised by the Air Ministry and the Empire Press Union for the benefit of 170 members of the Canadian Weekly Newspaper Association. Hamilton, flying an Avro 504, gave a demonstration of stunt flying. Hamilton was posted to the Inland Area Aircraft Depot at Henlow on 17 September 1924, and on 3 December was placed on half-pay. He was restored to full pay on 15 September 1925, only to resign his commission for good on 19 September. Commercial career Hamilton acquired a Martinsyde F.6 (G-EBDK) from F. P. Raynham, and on 29 January 1925 he flew from London to St. Moritz, Switzerland, via Paris, Zurich, and Chur, a total distance of 450 miles, being airborne for eight hours. In August he competed in two events at the Royal Aero Club Meeting at Lympne Aerodrome, Kent. Hamilton, along with Geoffrey de Havilland, Hubert Broad and others, was a founder member of the British Private Aircraft Owners' Club on 17 February 1926. During the General Strike in May Hamilton was one of the pilots taking part a scheme organised by the Royal Aero Club to deliver newspapers by air. Hamilton also entered the 1926 King's Cup Race, but was obliged to withdraw as his engine was not ready in time. In 1926‚Äì27 Hamilton operated a private flying taxi service in Switzerland and the South of France flying a Vickers Viking IV amphibious aircraft (G-EBED). (A replica of G-EBED can be seen at Brooklands Museum.) Atlantic flight and disappearance A Fokker VIIa, similar to St. Raphael Hamilton was then involved in an attempt to make the first flight across the Atlantic from east to west, flying from England to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Princess Lowenstein-Wertheim, a widowed aircraft enthusiast, provided the finance and the aircraft, a Fokker F.VIIa (G-EBTQ) fitted with a 500 hp Bristol Jupiter engine, and named St. Raphael. The aircraft, flown by Hamilton and Frederick F. Minchin from Imperial Airways, with Princess Lowenstein- Wertheim as passenger, took off from Upavon Aerodrome, Wiltshire, on 31 August 1927 at 7:15a.m. They flew along the south coast of Wales, across to Ireland, making their departure over the Aran Islands. The last confirmed sighting was made by the oil tanker SS Josiah Macy at 9:44p.m. in the mid-Atlantic. Around 6a.m. the next morning the Dutch steamer SS Blijdendijik reported seeing a white light travelling eastward in the sky when about 420 miles east-south- east of New York, which, if it were St. Raphael, was far to the south of its intended route, suggesting that they were lost. The aircraft was never seen again.

They are known primarily for their instructional works for headphones where the audience perform the piece themselves for each other. The term Autoteatro was coined by Hampton and Mercuriali to describe this approach to their performance practice. Rotozaza pieces include Etiquette, GuruGuru, Wondermart and Romcom. Rotozaza's international work is supported by the British Council.http://www.britishcouncil.org/arts- performanceinprofile-2009-british_council-rotozaza.htm Background Following several years work involving different performers for each event (who would agree to follow instructions given to them live, via different means), they began making shows where the audience, following instructions via headphones, would end up performing the show themselves, for each other. Their first show to function like this, Etiquette, was originally conceived of in 2001 as a proposal for the London International Festival of Theatre, but the idea was shelved until late 2006. Etiquette continues to tour worldwide, having been re-edited in twelve languages. The name comes from a series of kinetic sculptures and performances by Jean Tinguely. Hampton chose the name due to the multidisciplinary nature of Tinguely's Rotozaza series and for how the word sounds. Tinguely and Hampton also share a birthplace (Fribourg, Switzerland).

It depicts the Pope as a paranoid, drug-addled idiot and the Vatican as corrupt. Fo, an Italian actor-playwright awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature, is known for aiming his sarcasm and slapstick comedy at authority, and in The Pope and the Witch he takes dead aim at the highest levels of the Roman Catholic Church. Plot summary At the outset, the nameless pope, with 100,000 orphans waiting in St. Peter's Square and the world's press assembled for a news conference in the Vatican, is in the throes of paranoia, believing that the appearance of the children is sponsored by manufacturers of condoms in a plot to embarrass the Church. The witch, in nun's habit, turns up as an aide to the doctor summoned to treat the pope, and before long the Holy Father is seized with a paralytic affliction that, among other names, is known as a crucifixion stroke, leaving him with his arms outstretched. 2006 U.S. incident In October 2006, top Catholic leaders in the Midwestern U.S. state of Minnesota took the rare step of collectively calling on University of Minnesota president, Robert Bruininks, to reconsider the university's plan to stage a controversial play which they viewed as anti-Catholic. Archbishop Harry Flynn of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, along with bishops from Crookston to Winona, wrote to Bruininks calling the play offensive to the state's 1.6 million Catholics. They urged Bruininks to rethink the staging of the play in March 2007. Translations Ed Emery has carried out an authorised English translation.Fo, Dario. The Pope and the Witch, trans.

Kiessling's \\"Temptation Sensation\\" is the theme song for the long-running American sitcom It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Life and career  Kiessling studied piano, composition and conducting after World War II at the Nuremberg Conservatory in 1949, and started his career in 1949 as a pianist and played in different concerts around the world. Soon after, he started working on recording music for television. In 1950, he began composing music in the jazz, dance and light music genres. At times, he also led his own orchestra, and also worked many years for the RIAS Big Band in Berlin. Together with the pianist Werner Tautz (December 9, 1922 ‚Äì May 19, 2014) he established in 1964 the label \\"Brilliant\\" through which he managed numerous national and international big bands. Kiessling worked with many national and international stars, including Chet Baker, Luis Bonfa, Wenche Myhre, and Caterina Valente. For over two decades, he accompanied the shows of Peter Alexander. In addition, Kiessling composed the songs and scene music for numerous films and television productions, including ', Zwei himmlische T√∂chter, Dingsda, Das Traumschiff and Aktenzeichen XY... ungel√∂st. In total he produced over 1200 tunes and also published some of his own recordings which made him become one of the most successful German \\"easy listening\\" composers of the post-war period.  Notable Works  In 1969, Kiessling wrote \\"In The Shadow of the Moon\\" for Reprise, which later on became the theme song for Frank Sinatra's daughter Tina Sinatra TV mini-series Romeo und Julia 70. His piece \\"Temptation Sensation\\" is used as the theme song for the FX and FXX TV show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Always Sunny cast member Charlie Day told Entertainment Weekly that the original pilot of the show took place in Los Angeles and the theme song used to be a cha-cha version of \\"Hooray for Hollywood.\\" \\"FX loved the show, but wanted to take it out of the entertainment industry,\\" Day explained. \\"We had a music supervisor called Ray Espinola and we said, 'Give us everything you have in a sort of Leave It to Beaver with a big band-swing kind of feel,‚Äô and the majority of the songs are from what he sent over.

He is currently working in an advisory capacity in the private sector. Education and career He graduated from the London School of Economics (LSE). He later obtained a Master of Arts in Economics from New York University and a PhD in Economics from LSE. After his studies, he worked as a senior economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris from 1988 to 1998. In 1998, Papakonstantinou returned to Greece and was appointed an adviser to then-Prime Minister Costas Simitis on \\"information society\\" issues. Two years later, he was appointed Special Secretary for the \\"Information Society\\" at the Ministry of Economy and Finance (2000‚Äì2002). Between 2002 and 2004 he served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, as a board member of OTE (Hellenic Telecommunication Organization), and as the Greek representative to the European Union's Economic Policy Committee (EPC). In 2003 he coordinated the \\"Lisbon Strategy\\" for economic and social reforms during the Greek Presidency of the EU. Between 2004 and 2007, Papakonstantinou served as economic advisor to George Papandreou, the president of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). He was also a board member of the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies, PASOK's think tank, from 2005 to 2008. Between 2003 and 2007, Papakonstantinou also taught economics at Department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business and advised the European Commission on research and information society issues, participating in various international research projects. Political career In May 2005, Papakonstantinou was elected a member of the National Council of PASOK. In September 2007, he was elected member of the Hellenic Parliament to represent the district of Kozani, and was subsequently appointed PASOK's Press Spokesman in March 2008. Papakonstantinou headed PASOK's list of candidates for the European Parliament in the 2009 European elections and was elected MEP in June 2009. In October 2009 he was appointed Finance Minister in the government formed by Papandreou, the former prime minister, after the national elections. As Finance Minister, he revealed that the Greek deficit was much larger than what was reported by the previous government, and when Greece was shut out of international markets, he negotiated a ‚Ç¨110bn loan agreement for Greece with the EU and the International Monetary Fund, together with a programme of severe fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. During his tenure, he overhauled the budget process, instituting a medium-term fiscal framework with expenditure monitoring and assessment mechanisms, and an independent statistical authority; embarked on tax reform, with legislative and organizational changes to combat tax evasion; implemented a wide-ranging program of structural reforms in product, service and financial markets; and designed a large-scale and wide-ranging privatization strategy. When he left office, the public deficit was more than 6 percentage points of GDP lower than upon his appointment, while Greece had recovered half the competitiveness lost since Eurozone entry and was named the OECD country with the fastest pace of structural reforms. In June 2011, Prime Minister George Papandreou reshuffled the government and appointed him Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, a post he kept in the government of Lucas Papademos until he handed over to a caretaker Minister in May 2012. In the field of environment, he accelerated the closure of uncontrolled landfills; revamped the waste management and recycling systems; helped implement a large number of water management projects co-funded by EU Structural Funds; advanced the completion of land and urban planning and of the national cadastre. In energy, he brought legislation to liberalize the energy market; oversaw a large increase of Greece's renewable energy capacity and presented a road map for energy policies to 2050; spearheaded ambitious renewable energy projects, such as Project Helios for exporting solar energy; pursued Greek participation in international gas routes; and brought forward the exploration of Greece's hydrocarbon potential. He was one of a number of Papademos' cabinet who failed to be re-elected in the May 6, 2012 General election that saw PASOK lose almost 120 seats in the house. Following the elections, Papakonstantinou has faced a parliamentary investigation into the handling of the so-called Lagarde list, containing information on the deposits of roughly 2,000 Greek citizens at HSBC bank's Geneva branch, which he asked for and received from French authorities in 2010. While Papakonstantinou asked the Greek tax authorities to investigate the list, they failed to do so. In late 2012, prosecutors asked for a fresh copy of the Greek list and compared it to the one they had, they found that three names were missing from the list, all relatives of Papakonstantinou. Those allegations resulted in his expulsion from the PASOK political party. He has consistently denied all charges and claims he is being made a scapegoat for the inaction of others on this issue as well as for the public's need to punish politicians for the austerity policies in Greece. In 2015, a Special Court convened for this case and composed of 13 judges drawn from the two highest Greek courts unanimously cleared him of the breach of faith charge, concluding that there had been no damage to the State from his actions. At the same time, with an 8 to 5 majority by the court, he received a suspended misdemeanour conviction for the tampering charge. In 2016 he published a book in which he told his story as finance minister of Greece when the debt crisis unfolded. Personal life Papakonstantinou is married to travel writer . They have two sons, Nicolas and Stefanos.

During that time, McKay was responsible for the daily firing of the One O'Clock Gun at Edinburgh Castle, becoming the longest- serving holder of the post. McKay was born in Lochgelly, Fife, and grew up in Musselburgh. He joined 529 Company Royal Army Service Corps, part of the Territorial Army. The One O'clock Gun is a time signal, given at 1.00pm Monday to Saturday, and has been operating since 1861. McKay began firing the gun in July 1979, and during his long service became a recognisable Edinburgh character. At that time, the gun was a 25-pound Howitzer, although this was replaced with a L118 Light Gun, brought into service on 30 November 2001, with \\"Tam the Gun\\" firing the first round. In 1999, Sergeant McKay was awarded the MBE by the Queen, for his services to the Territorial Army. Sergeant McKay was instrumental in setting up the One O'Clock Gun exhibition within the castle, obtaining funding from the National Lottery and Historic Scotland. The exhibition, initially temporary but now permanent, explains the origins of Edinburgh's time signals, first established in the 1840s by Charles Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland. McKay also floated the idea of sponsorship of the One O'clock Gun, in order to secure its future. He undertook fundraising work for the Army Benevolent Fund, and in 2002 published a book of anecdotes and history relating to the gun, entitled, What Time Does Edinburgh's One O'clock Gun Fire?, the proceeds of which went towards the fund. McKay also appeared on BBC Scotland's Hogmanay Live programme, firing the gun to mark the New Year. He continued to fire the gun until his retirement on 27 January 2005. He died at his home in Dunfermline at the age of 60. The name Tam the Gun was given to a GNER Class 91 locomotive, No.91122, in June 2006 in honour of Sergeant McKay. The locomotive was named by his widow in an official ceremony at Edinburgh Waverley. The name formerly carried on the locomotive was Double Trigger, and along with the rest of the class, lost the name when National Express East Coast took over the franchise.

Megaleas was entirely under the influence of the advisor Apelles, and readily entered into his treasonable designs (218 BC), to baffle the operations of Philip in his war against the Aetolians. Their treachery, however, was counteracted by Aratus of Sicyon, and the latter accordingly was assailed with personal violence by the royal friends (philoi) Megaleas, Leontius, and Crinon, at Limnaea, in Acarnania, when Philip had returned thither from his successful campaign in Aetolia. For this offence Megaleas and Crinon were thrown into prison 'till they should find security for a fine twenty talents, but Megaleas was released on the bail of Leontius, who had contrived to escape in the tumult for which his accomplices were punished. In the same year (218) Megaleas and Leontius excited a mutiny at Corinth among the troops of Philip. It was soon quelled; and, though the king knew who had been the authors of it, he dissembled his knowledge, and Megaleas and his chief accomplices were still holding high military rank when Apelles returned to court from Chalcis. The reception, however, of the latter proved that he had quite lost his master's confidence, and Megaleas fled in alarm to Athens; and being refused refugee there, betook himself to Thebes. Here he continued his impotent and rancorous course of treason by writing letters to the Aetolians, filled with abuse of Philip, and with strong exhortations to them to persevere in the war against him, as his finances were exhausted. The letters were intercepted and brought to the king, who thereupon despatched Alexander to Thebes, to sue Megaleas for the amount of his fine; and the traitor, not venturing to abide the issue of the trial, put an end to his own life.

A form of medical home, the model has been developed and tested by a multidisciplinary team of experts at the Roger C. Lipitz Center for Integrated Health Care in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Guided Care is provided by physician-nurse teams in primary care practices to the physicians' most complex patients, mainly older adults with chronic conditions and complicated health needs. It is designed to increase patients' quality of care and quality of life, while improving the efficiency of their use of health care resources, thus reducing their overall health care costs. In Guided Care, a registered nurse based in a primary care office works closely with three to four physicians to provide state-of-the-art chronic care for 50‚Äì60 chronically ill patients. Following a comprehensive assessment and an evidence-based care planning process, the Guided Care nurse monitors patients, promotes self-management, smooths transitions between sites of care, educates and supports family caregivers, facilitates access to community resources, and coordinates the efforts of health care professionals, hospitals and community agencies to avoid duplication and conflicting advice.

Epub 2009 Sep 30. Specific utilization results indicate that, on average, Guided Care decreased total health care costs by 11 percent, with an average net annual savings of $1,364 per patient for health insurers. Savings were achieved by reducing hospital admissions and days, emergency department visits, home healthcare episodes, and days in skilled nursing facilities. Based on these early results, two of the managed care organizations that participated in the RCT, including Kaiser Permanente Mid- Atlantic States Region, have decided to pay for the costs of Guided Care for at least a year following the conclusion of the RCT. How it works In Guided Care, a team of health care professionals, including a registered nurse, two to five physicians, and other members of the office staff, works together for the benefit of each patient to: *Perform a comprehensive assessment at home *Create an evidence-based Care Guide and a patient-friendly Action Plan *Promote patient self-management *Monitor and coach the patient monthly *Coordinate the efforts of all the patient's health care providers *Smooth the patient's transition between sites of care *Educate and support family caregivers *Facilitate access to appropriate community resources The Guided Care nurse plays a central role in coordinating care for patients.The New York Times New Old Age blog March 31, 2009. Anne Underwood. \\"Care Coordination: Too Expensive for Medicare?\\" Nurses assess, plan, monitor, educate, coordinate, empower, and work with community agencies to ensure that the patient's goals for healthcare are met, providing personal support to each patient individually.Giddens JF, Tanner E, Frey K, Reider L, Boult C, \\"Expanding the Gerontological Nursing Role in Guided Care,\\" Geriatric Nursing, 2009 The end result is the establishment of a \\"patient-centered medical home\\" for high-risk patients with complex health care needs; a health care practice that provides comprehensive, coordinated and continuous care to some of its most challenging and vulnerable patients. Rationale According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic disease accounts for seven out of 10 deaths among Americans each year. By the year 2025, more than 25 percent of the population will be living with multiple chronic conditions, and the cost for managing their care is expected to reach $1.07 trillion.Gerard Anderson, \\"Chronic Conditions,\\" Expert Voices, National Institute for Health Care Management 2002 Guided Care has been developed as a solution to the chronic disease problem currently facing millions of Americans. Within the last few years, Guided Care has been recognized as a leading model of health care for older adults with multiple chronic conditions. Guided Care has received the 2009 Medical Economics Award for Innovation in Practice Improvement cosponsored by the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and Medical Economics magazine. In 2008, Guided Care won the American Public Health Association's 2008 Archstone Foundation Award for Excellence in Program Innovation, which recognizes one innovative model of health care for older Americans each year. Resources for adoption There are several tools and resources available for the adoption of Guided Care and other medical home programs. These tools are available online at MedHomeInfo, and include an implementation manual and accredited online courses for nurses, physicians and practice leaders.

Carlton Weddington is a former member of the Ohio House of Representatives for the 27th District. He resigned his Ohio House seat after his indictment on bribery and ethics charges in March 2012, the first sitting state legislator in Ohio indicted for bribery in 100 years. Weddington was convicted of the charges and sentenced in June 2012 to three years in prison. Early life and education Wilburn Carlton Weddington was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 4, 1970 to Dr. Wilburn Harold Weddington, a family physician (and later professor emeritus of family medicine at the Ohio State University College of Medicine),http://columbusbicentennial.blogspot.com/2012/01/dr-wilburn-h- weddington-family-practice.html and Rose Carline (Howard) Weddington. He was one of five children.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dispatch/obituary.aspx?pid=145036896 He attended Hampton University and graduated with a B.A. in political science. Career Weddington worked as an Ohio Department of Job and Family Services liaison, a member of the Columbus, Ohio School Board from 2006 to 2009, and as an Ohio School Board Association (OSBA) Trustee and OSBA president before election to the Ohio House of Representatives. Ohio House of Representatives With Minority Leader Joyce Beatty term limited in 2008, four vied to replace her in the House.

He was also a member of the Correctional Institution Inspection Committee and the Ohio Commission on Fatherhood. Initiatives and positions Weddington was quoted as being critical of Ohio Governor John Kasich's lack of cabinet diversity. A contributor to the biennial transportation budget, Weddington criticized a measure to allow county clerks of court to act as deputy registrars, stating that it put small businesses at an unfair advantage. The measure ended up passing the Ohio House anyway. Weddington stated that Republicans were \\"trying to put some of us all in the back of the bus\\" by allowing the passage of a bill that requires photo ID to cast a ballot. He believed the bill disenfranchised African American voters. Conviction for bribery FBI Special Agents conducted an investigation concerning possible legislative misconduct after information came to the agency's attention in connection with payday loan legislation being considered at the Ohio Statehouse. Information later cited by an FBI spokesman as a trigger of the investigation was a 2009 email in which Weddington demanded that a lobbyist for the payday loan industry come through with some \\"serious cheese\\" or provide him with a suite to an upcoming Cleveland Cavaliers game. The FBI also cited an email Weddington sent in September 2009 in which he asked which lobbyists and associations could be approached for money because of his work on a DNA-testing bill. Undercover FBI agents mounted an elaborate sting operation, creating a fake California wine company. In 2011, they spent more than $10,000 on fine dining and lavish trips to California and Miami for Weddington and his girlfriend, successfully persuading Weddington to draft a state budget amendment, and later a stand- alone bill, to help the company sell wine in Ohio. None of the bogus company's gifts were reported on Weddington's financial-disclosure statements for 2011. On March 13, 2012, Weddington was indicted by a Franklin County grand jury for bribery, a third degree felony, election falsification, a fifth degree felony, and filing a false Ethics Disclosure statement, a first degree misdemeanor. The charges carried a maximum penalty of 4¬Ω years in prison. The bribery count alleged that Weddington received cash and all-expense-paid trips to South Beach Miami, Florida and Napa Valley, California during 2011, as well as checks and cash for campaign contributions, in order to corrupt or influence him in the performance of his official duties as a State Representative. One count in the indictment charged that Weddington made false statements in the \\"Committee to Elect Weddington\\" 2011 annual campaign finance report filed with the Ohio Secretary of State. It was alleged that the report falsely stated the contributions and expenditures that were received by him and the committee, as well as the total figures for that campaign finance report. The indictment also charged Weddington with filing a false 2011 Ethics Financial Disclosure report with the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee, a report that all members of the Ohio General Assembly must file. Weddington failed to disclose gifts, travel, and lodging expenses that are required by law to be listed on that financial disclosure form. FBI agents approached Representative Weddington after the false financial disclosure report was filed in February 2012. Following consultation with counsel, Weddington agreed to cooperate with the FBI and Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien's office. The first step in that cooperation was an agreement to resign his elected position in the Ohio General Assembly, which he did on March 13, 2012. Also, Weddington withdrew his candidacy for re-election and requested that his name be removed from the November ballot. Prosecutor O'Brien commended the efforts of the FBI Special Agents involved for their work during the investigation and said that his research found no case of an Ohio General Assembly member being indicted for bribery in almost a century. On June 18, 2012, Weddington was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty in Franklin County Common Pleas Court to one count each of bribery and election falsification, both felonies, and one misdemeanor ethics violation. Weddington began serving his sentence in mid-August 2012; the sentencing judge was quoted at that time as being willing to consider granting Weddington judicial release after two years provided he had a good prison record. On June 13, 2014, the Columbus Dispatch reported that Weddington's attorneys filed a motion seeking his early release in Franklin County Common Pleas Court. Attorney Karl Schneider wrote in the motion that Weddington was \\"humbled and rehabilitated\\" and had been a model inmate, providing literacy training to other inmates, completing several classes and participating in community service programs at the prison. If granted, it would have made Weddington eligible for release on August 17, 2014. On July 21, the Dispatch reported that the motion had been denied by Franklin County Judge Mark Serrott without further comment. Weddington was granted early release from prison on October 30, 2014, ten months before the completion of his original three-year sentence.

Kiplinger was a Washington correspondent (1970‚Äì73) and bureau manager (1976‚Äì78) at the Griffin-Larrabee News Bureau, which provided daily Washington coverage to more than 20 newspapers throughout the country, from Maine to Alaska, including all the community dailies of the Ottaway Newspapers subsidiary of Dow Jones & Co. One of Kiplinger's stories revealed that a Pocono Mountains (Pa.) vacation home development, whose deceptive sales practices had been cited by the federal government, was owned by a U.S. senator who sat on the committee that oversaw the regulation of interstate land sales; the senator soon sold the project.p. 150, Inside the Wall Street Journal, by Jerry M. Rosenberg (1982, Macmillan Publishing Co.) For six years (1978‚Äì1983) Kiplinger was chief of Ottaway News Service, overseeing coverage from the chain's bureaus in Washington, Albany, Boston, and Harrisburg. Also acting as Washington bureau chief, Kiplinger wrote columns and features for the Ottaway papers. In 1983 Kiplinger moved to the Kiplinger publishing organization (founded in 1920 by his grandfather, reporter W. M. Kiplinger) in the position of vice president for publications. In 1985 he became editor in chief of Kiplinger's Changing Times magazine (renamed Kiplinger's Personal Finance in 1991). He succeeded his father, Austin H.

Kiplinger is a member of the National Press Club, the Society of Professional Journalists, and the Society of American Business Editors and Writers. Kiplinger believes that young adults should not go into their families‚Äô businesses too early, until they have accomplished something on their own; otherwise they will not get an honest assessment of their abilities. ‚ÄúI spent the first 13 years of my journalism career in the employ of others, as a Washington correspondent and bureau chief, making my mistakes on their dime, learning reporting, editing and management before coming to Kiplinger,‚Äù he said in a 2001 interview.Profile of Kiplinger company and KAK‚Äôs new directions, ‚ÄúBuilding on Kiplinger‚Äôs Traditions: Venerable Publishing Company Explores a High-Tech Future,‚Äù The Washington Post, ‚ÄúWashington Business‚Äù section, p. 1, June 14, 1993 ‚ÄúWhen second- and third-generation leaders eventually come into a family business, there‚Äôs often a presumption of incompetence,‚Äù he quipped, ‚Äúso they benefit from low expectations.

He contributed numerous articles, stories and poems to The Bulletin from 1901 and The Lone Hand, often under the pseudonym \\"Kodak\\". He commenced writing as a young single man, working in a bicycle shop then for the International Harvester Company, and living in a series of boarding-houses, which formed the basis of many of his stories. His stories were mostly ridiculous comic observations of working- class city life, though he could write tenderly and observantly, especially on Irish subjects. Unlike contemporaries such as Henry Lawson, he seldom wrote of bush life or of romance. His most famous story is The Lobster and the Lioness of a drunken boarding-house lodger who mistakes a runaway lioness for a large shaggy dog. An admirer of his writing was Nettie Palmer, who arranged for The Melbourne Pioneer Players, with which she was associated, to stage a play he wrote. His most famous poem was Chunda Loo of A Kim Foo, illustrated by Norman Lindsay and used in advertisements for \\"Cobra\\" boot polish.

The Ashepoo Combahee Edisto Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve (often shortened to ACE Basin NERR) is a reserve area located in the ACE Basin, one of the largest undeveloped estuaries on the Atlantic coast of the United States. It is named for the Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto Rivers, which flow past cypress swamps, historic plantation houses, old rice fields and tidal marshes to meet at South Carolina's biologically rich St. Helena Sound. The ACE Basin NERR is intended to protect the natural environment, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area. The reserve also preserves the habitat of a number of endangered or threatened species, such as shortnose sturgeon, wood storks, loggerhead sea turtles and bald eagles. Commercial fisherman harvest supplies of shrimp, crab, oyster, clam and finfish each year in the ACE Basin. Recreational fishermen ply the mudflats for spottail bass, flounder and shrimp, while paddlers visit the salt marsh creeks and the black waters of the rivers. Research conducted at the ACE Basin NERR enhance the protection of these commercial and recreational uses by monitoring water quality, providing information on the number and types of plant and animal species, and evaluating the overall health of the ACE Basin ecosystem. Through a number of educational programs, the reserve provides information to coastal decision makers, lawmakers, teachers, students and the general public. The reserve sponsors a summer lecture series, develops curriculum materials for teachers, offers a touch tank program for children and conducts educational cruises where students and teachers learn about estuaries and their values to marine, avian and human life.

Life He was educated at All Souls' College, Oxford, where he was admitted B.A. 19 December 1534, and commenced M.A. 31 March 1539. He was elected a fellow of his college, and after taking orders became rector of Fladbury, Worcestershire, and chaplain to Richard Pate, sharing in his 1542 act of attainder.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=76639 Later, on leaving Rome for England in 1554, he became chaplain to Cardinal Pole.John Allen, The English Hospice in Rome (2005), p. 207. In 1555 he was chosen Warden of All Souls' College, and on 26 April in that year he was installed as prebendary of Worcester. On 12 August 1557 he was installed Dean of Worcester in the place of Philip Hawford, the last Abbot of Evesham, and about the same time he was instituted to the rectory of Bishop Cleeve, Gloucestershire. Shortly before Mary's death, Cardinal Pole, then lying on his deathbed, sent Holland to the Princess Elizabeth, with a letter in which he dwelt on his fidelity, and begged her 'to give credit to whatever he shall say on my behalf'.http://www.godrules.net/library/strype/96strype_a2.htm gives this from John Strype; Thompson Cooper in the Dictionary of National Biography here confuses Mary and Elizabeth. As Holland refused to comply with the religious changes introduced after Elizabeth's accession, he was removed from the wardenship of All Souls, and in October 1559 he was deprived of the deanery of Worcester. He was committed prisoner to the Marshalsea, and, dying in confinement, was buried on 6 March 1561 in St. George's parish, Southwark, brought to the church by about threescore gentlemen of the Inns of Court and Oxford.

The printed text consists of 874 pages of the Hebrew Bible, two pages setting forth both appearances of the Ten Commandments (one from Exodus 20 and the other from Deuteronomy 5) each showing the two different cantillations - for private and for public recitation, 23 pages briefly describing the research background and listing alternative readings (mostly from the Leningrad Codex, and almost all very slight differences in spelling or even pointing, which do not change the meaning), a page of the blessings - the Ashkenazic, Sefardic and Yemenite versions - used before and after reading the Haftarah (the selection from the Prophets), a 9-page list of the annual schedule of the Haftarot readings according to the three traditions. The text has been recognized as the official Bible of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Israeli parliament (the Knesset) since 2001. Since its publication, it has been used to administer the oath of office to new presidents of the State of Israel. The text was edited according to the method of Mordechai Breuer under the supervision of Yosef Ofer, with additional proofreading and refinements since the Horev edition. The Aleppo Crown The Jerusalem Crown is a printed edition of the Aleppo Codex, known in Hebrew as the ◊õ◊™◊® ◊ê◊®◊ù ◊¶◊ï◊ë◊î (Keter Aram Tsovah -- \\"Crown of Aleppo\\"), a Masoretic codex worked up circa 929 CE and claimed to have been proofread and provided with vowel points and accents by the great Masoretic master, Aaron ben Moses ben Asher. The Wikipedia article on the Aleppo Codex provides further details and history of this important manuscript. During the pogrom on December 1, 1947 (two days after the United Nations voted to recommend partition of Mandatory Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state) the Syrian Army firebombed the Great Synagogue of Aleppo and the Codex was originally reported as completely destroyed. In fact, more than two-thirds of the Codex survived and was later (ca. 1957) smuggled into Israel. At that time only 294 pages were gotten (later one more page was turned in) from an original total whose estimates run from 380 to 491 pages (possibly the lowest estimate is for the Bible text alone and the higher estimates include appendices such as Masoretic notes, treatises on grammar, etc., such as are part of the Leningrad Codex).Yawil, Hayim & Schneider, Bernard, Crown of Aleppo: The Mystery of the Oldest Hebrew Bible Codex (2010, Philadelphia, Jewish Publ'n Soc.) pages 110-111. In general, most of the Torah was missing (the surviving text started at Deuteronomy 28:17), some pages were missing from the Prophets, and a substantial portion of the Ketuvim was missing (the surviving text ended at Song of Songs 3:11; completely lost were Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah‚Äîas well as some pages in the midst of surviving books).Ben-Zvi, Izhak, The Codex of Ben Asher, Textus vol. 1, pages 2-3 (1960), revised and enlarged from an article in Hebrew in Sinai vol. 23 (1957), reprinted in Leiman, Sid Z., ed., The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible: An Introductory Reader (1974, NY, Ktav Publ'g Co.) pages 758-759; Ofer, Yosef, The History and Authority of the Aleppo Codex, in Glazer, Mordechai, ed., Companion Volume to Keter Yerushalam (2002, Jerusalem, N.

Starting in 1986, the Israel Museum took ten years to remove a thousand years' accumulation of dirt, and even fungus, from the manuscript, and do other restorative work.Mendel, Malky, Book Review: Jerusalem Crown and Companion Volume, Hakirah, vol. 2 (Fall 2005), pages 170-173, summarizes the history of the manuscript. The Bible scholar Mordechai Breuer made a point of finding and collecting known every pre-1947 description of the Aleppo Codex (most of these were unpublished), including some surreptitious photographs, and used the descriptions of the surviving parts to verify the authenticity of the Codex and the descriptions of the missing parts to provide insights into the readings.Ofer, Yosef, The History and Authority of the Aleppo Codex, in Glazer, Mordechai, ed., Companion Volume to Keter Yerushalam (2002, Jerusalem, N. Ben-Zvi Printing Enterprises) pages 40-42; these included a copy of a printed Torah with handwritten notes by Yishai ben Amram ha-Cohen Amadi (end of the 16th century), a note written by a mid-19th century Aleppo rabbi listing eleven significant readings of the Codex which was found by Umberto Cassuto in the pages of the Codex (ca. 1943), a long list of notes by the same 19th-century rabbi answering questions submitted to him by mail, and a printed Bible thoroughly marked up with notes by a late 19th-century rabbi who examined the Codex - this Bible was not publicized and was almost discarded in 1987 when it was fortuitously identified. Also see: http://www.aleppocodex.org/links/9.html . To fill in remaining gaps he used the text of the Leningrad Codex, which was almost as distinguished and authoritative. He produced an edition of this reconstructed Bible for the Mossad Harav Kook, in Jerusalem, in 1989 and again (slightly revised) in 1998. Additionally, a photo-facsimile edition of the surviving pages of the Aleppo Codex was published by Nahum Ben-Zvi in 1976. The pages smuggled into Israel were verified as the authentic Aleppo Codex, which owed its high reputation partly to the praise heaped upon it by Maimonides in the late 12th century, and partly also to its claim to have been personally proofread and marked with the vowel points and accents by the last of the great family of Masoretes, Aaron ben Moshe ben Asher, not only by matching the various descriptions which had been published, but also by matching descriptions by Maimonides in documents which had not yet been published.Goshen-Gottstein, Moshe, The Authenticity of the Aleppo Codex, Textus, vol. 1 (1960), pages 17-58, reprinted in Leiman, Sid Z., The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible: An Introductory Reader (1974, NY, Ktav Publ'g House) pages 773-814. As might be expected, the handwritten notes made by scholars who had been privileged to handle the Codex could not be as completely reliable as the manuscript itself. For example, a number of them had, on different occasions, copied down, supposedly word-for-word, the dedicatory colophon of the Codex (on a page now missing), which included some details of the manuscript's provenance‚Äîyet their different copies disagreed with each other.Harvianen, Tarpani, Abraham Firkovich, the Aleppo Codex, and Its Dedication, in Borr√°s, Judit T., and S√°enz-Badillos, Angel, edd., Jewish Studies at the Turn of the 20th Century: Proceedings of the 6th EAJS [European Assn. of Judiac Studies] Congress, Toledo [Spain], July 1998 (1999, Leiden, Holland, K. Brill) pages 131-132; maybe this is not important because there is evidence that this colophon was added centuries after the manuscript was worked up. Ben-Zvi, Izhak, The Codex of Ben Asher, Textus vol. 1, pages 12-13 (1960), revised and enlarged from an article in Hebrew in Sinai vol. 23 (1957), reprinted in Leiman, Sid Z., ed., The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible: An Introductory Reader (1974, NY, Ktav Publ'g Co.) pages 768-769. However, the Aleppo Codex has many virtues. In its text of the Prophets (where it is nearly complete) it has fewer spelling errors than either the Leningrad Codex or the Cairo Codex.Mendel, Malky, Book Review: Jerusalem Crown and Companion Volume, Hakirah, vol. 2 (Fall 2005), page 173. It has long been known that there are nine spelling differences (insignificant to meaning) between manuscripts of either Ashkenaz or Sefardic origin and manuscripts of Yemenite origin‚Äîand the Aleppo Codex sides with the Yemenite manuscripts on those differences.Mendel, Malky, Book Review: Jerusalem Crown and Companion Volume, Hakirah, vol. 2 (Fall 2005), page 177. The Aleppo Codex conforms consistently to Maimonides's quotations of Scripture, which the Leningrad Codex does not.Goshen-Gottstein, Moshe, The Authenticity of the Aleppo Codex, Textus, vol. 1 (1960), page 27, reprinted in Leiman, Sid Z., The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible: An Introductory Reader (1974, NY, Ktav Publ'g House) page 783. Layout Nahum Ben-Zvi, who conceived the idea of publishing the Jerusalem Crown, prepared the text of the Aleppo Codex for the press in a three-column layout, thus preserving the original layout of many of the most important Jewish manuscripts. The Jerusalem Crown was the first publication to return to this layout since the invention of the printing press. The project was made possible by the availability of computerized typesetting. The poetic passages in the Pentateuch and the Prophets are printed in the traditional layout (‚Äúhalf-bricks set over whole bricks‚Äù). The Song at the Sea (Exodus chapter 15) is presented as a single unit, on a separate page. The books of Job, Proverbs, and Psalms have been printed in a different layout; each verse of these books being presented in a single line and divided into two hemistichs (according to their poetic meter);Ben-Zvi, Nahum, The Making of a Book: Producing the Jerusalem Crown, in Glazer, Mordechai, ed., Companion Volume to Keter Yerushalam (2002, Jerusalem, N. Ben- Zvi Printing Enterprises), especially pages 16-18; Sanders, James A., Review of Jerusalem Crown, Review of Biblical Literature (March 2004), http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/4090_3973.pdf . this layout enables even readers unfamiliar with the biblical accentuation marks to read the text correctly. However, it also dictated a change in the typography of the pages compared with the rest of the Bible. The majority of the text, which is prose, is printed in three columns to the page. Psalms, Proverbs, and most of Job is printed in two columns to the page. Chapter and verse numbers are added throughout, using Hebrew letters for the numerals. Font A new typeface, called Jerusalem Crown, was designed especially for this Bible by Zvi Narkiss. The typeface was modeled on the original lettering of the Aleppo Codex. Considerable thought went into the design of this clear, very legible lettering.Ben-Zvi, Nahum, The Making of a Book: Producing the Jerusalem Crown, in Glazer, Mordechai, ed., Companion Volume to Keter Yerushalam (2002, Jerusalem, N. Ben-Zvi Printing Enterprises) pages 9-24. Published in the spring of 2001 as an act in behalf the Aleppo Codex, in a large exhibit edition, and the next year in a general trade edition with a companion volume. The edition is based on the latest scholarship concerning the biblical text and on the last version edited by Mordechai Breuer, the recipient of the 1999 Israel Prize in Bible Scholarship. The book was entirely set in print by computer, using a new computer program called \\"Tag\\", that could handle the letters, vowel points, accents, and the special characters. In previous editions around the world, only the majority of the text could be typeset by machine but the special characters had to be positioned by hand. The new font had to be designed by Zvi Narkiss with a repertory of 138 characters - letters, vowel points, accents, - and then special characters (certain letters are uncommonly large or small or superscript or inverted according to Masoretic tradition), many of them used only once. As with all printed Hebrew Bibles, there were about three million characters - letters, vowels, accents, and other marks - to be typeset.Ben-Zvi, Nahum, The Making of a Book: Producing the Jerusalem Crown, in Glazer, Mordechai, ed., Companion Volume to Keter Yerushalam (2002, Jerusalem, N. Ben-Zvi Printing Enterprises) pages 9-24. Editorial considerations Although the text of this edition was closely based on Breuer's edition, there were a very few departures where conscientious examination of the Codex itself indicated that Breuer had departed from the Aleppo text.Ofer, Yosef, The Jerusalem Crown and its Editorial Principles, in Glazer, Mordechai, ed., Companion Volume to Keter Yerushalam (2002, Jerusalem, N. Ben-Zvi Printing Enterprises), pages 51-59; Sanders, James A., Review of Jerusalem Crown, Review of Biblical Literature (March 2004), http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/4090_3973.pdf . This edition was published in a popular edition, with a Companion Volume in Hebrew and English, in 2002 to great praise. However, there was also a smattering of scholarly criticism. For example, that the Masoretic notes were almost totally omitted and the printed edition showed only some of the original Codex's qere and ketiv notes and incompletely indicated the Codex's sedarim divisions, the printed edition lacked the rafe cantillation mark and the ornamentation that marks the beginning of each parsha.Hobbins, J.F., The Crown of Jerusalem: A Review of an Edition of the Codex Aleppo (June 9, 2009), http://ancienthebrewpoetry.typepad.com/ancient_hebrew_poetry/2009/06/the- crown-of-jerusalem-a-review-of-an-edition-of-codex-aleppo.html ; Mendel, Malky, Book Review: Jerusalem Crown and Companion Volume, Hakirah, vol. 2 (Fall 2005), page 179. Certain bits of text had to be compared with the Codex itself, which was on display in the Israel Museum, because the photographs of the manuscript left some doubts.Ben-Zvi, Nahum, The Making of a Book: Producing the Jerusalem Crown, in Glazer, Mordechai, ed., Companion Volume to Keter Yerushalam (2002, Jerusalem, N. Ben-Zvi Printing Enterprises) page 19. Certain changes were actively introduced to bring the Aleppo text more into conformity with modern printed Bibles; for example, half-vowels are rather frequently used in the Aleppo Codex but were omitted from the printed edition because contrary to the modern pronunciation of the text; a stress mark called a ga'ayot was rarely used in the Aleppo Codex but is more common in modern editions - so the Aleppo appearances of this mark are shown slightly differently than the many added to make the edition conform to modern usage.Ofer, Yosef, The Jerusalem Crown and Its Editorial Principles, in Glazer, Mordechai, ed., Companion Volume to Keter Yerushalam (2002, Jerusalem, N. Ben-Zvi Printing Enterprises) pages 51-60. Additionally, the relatively few qere and ketiv notes that remain are put at the very bottom of a column, without any indication of the verse to which they are related, a style which becomes more confusing when a column has more than one such note. However these defects are considered microscopic in contrast to the overall high quality of this edition.

If measured by weight, organic (biodegradable) residue constitutes at least 50% of waste in developing countries. Labour costs are relatively low but waste management is generally a higher proportion of municipal expenditure. As urbanization continues, municipal solid waste grows faster than urban populations because of increasing consumption and shortening product life spans. Transboundary issues with waste Waste is shipped between countries for disposal and this can create problems in the target country. Electronic waste is commonly shipped to developing countries for recycling, reuse or disposal.

The securities and investment banking company was integrated into Charles Schwab in 2003. The business was relaunched in 2005 by former research director Ken Tuttle, who finally obtained SoundView's trademarks in 2011. Prior to 2003, Soundview was unique in that it combined accepted Wall Street research and distribution methods, with the intimate (albeit \\"arms length\\") relationship with Gartner analysts, and arguably became the leading technology research boutique on Wall Street. SoundView was based in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, and is now in Boston, Massachusetts. History In 1977, Gideon Gartner initiated a financial service for Gartner Group via a partnership with Dillon, Read & Co., which distributed its reports and personal services to Dillon, Read & Co. investment client organizations. Gartner Group severed the Dillon Read relationship and became an independent broker-dealer, Gartner Securities Corp., in 1984. Gartner Securities was spun off to its shareholders just before its first public offering in 1986, providing analysis, investment advice, and investment banking services, to institutional investors. The firm changed its name in 1988 to Soundview Technology, when Gartner was acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi. From 1988 to 1991 the firm remained a small focused brokerage operation with the bulk of their clients being small institutions and hedge funds. Expansion In 1991 the firm hired a senior investment banking executive, Brian Bristol, to begin to build an investment banking practice. Additional analysts were added to grow coverage as the technology sector continued to perform well.

This new, expanded Southern Command, with geographical responsibility across the old Eastern and Southern command areas, was itself merged into HQ UK Land Forces (HQ UKLF) in 1972. Formation sign variants During the Second World War and after, Southern Command, in common with other UK Commands, used its formation sign as a badge, (or flash) on uniforms. The HQ sign itself (see top of this article) with its horizontal red, black, red background colouring indicated an army level command, on which were five stars of the Southern Cross. Uniquely in Southern Command the background colour of the shield, and occasionally the stars, was changed to show the colours of the service corps of the personnel, other commands used their formation sign with an arm of service stripe ( thick) below it.

Meijer, who is distinguished professor of Molecular Sciences at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and Academy Professor of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, is considered one of the founders of the field of supramolecular polymer chemistry. Meijer is a prolific author, sought-after academic lecturer and recipient of multiple awards in the fields of organic and polymer chemistry.  Education  After attending secondary school in Appingedam where he graduated in 1972, Meijer received his education in Organic Chemistry at the University of Groningen. He obtained his MSc degree in 1978, and subsequently his PhD degree under supervision of Professor Hans Wijnberg in 1982. Meijer graduated summa cum laude with his thesis on 'Chemiluminescence in action: syntheses, properties, and applications of 1,2-dioxetanes'.  Career  Meijer started his career in 1982 at the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven as a research scientist in Molecular Materials. In 1989 he moved to DSM Research in Geleen to become head of the department for New Materials. In 1991 Meijer was installed as full professor of Organic Chemistry at the department for Chemistry & Chemical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and in 1999 at the department for Biomedical Engineering at the same university. Since 2004 Bert Meijer is a distinguished university professor of Molecular Sciences at TU/e, where he founded the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems and served as its Scientific Director from 2008 until 2018. Meijer is adjunct professor of Macromolecular Chemistry at Radboud University Nijmegen since 1994 and distinguished visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara since 2008. In 2014 Bert Meijer was inducted as Academy Professor of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Contributions to research  Meijer's research focuses on supramolecular systems with special properties and functions. It's founded on the principles of synthetic and organic chemistry to find solutions to challenges in materials science and life sciences. Meijer is recognized as a pioneer in the field of supramolecular materials, being one of the first chemists to explore and develop functional supramolecular polymers as a new class of materials. Via advanced molecular design and synthesis he has realized systems in which monomeric units self-assemble into long supramolecular polymeric chains, resulting in materials displaying unique dynamic properties that were thought to be exclusively reserved for macromolecules. His new class of supramolecular structures thus led to an adjusted definition of Staudinger‚Äôs description of what polymers are. Meijer's career took off with breakthrough results in dendrimer chemistry including a dendritic box and super-amphiphiles (being the first examples of polymersomes). He synthesized poly(propylene imine) dendrimers that are now produced at commercially relevant quantities (at multiple kilogram scale) worldwide. His dendrimers form the basic compound of a phosphate binder currently used in the clinic. Meijer also developed novel semiconducting polymers with high electron mobilities. His exploration of the combination of chirality and mesoscopic morphology in these polymers led to the fabrication of an LED that emits circularly polarized light. Many years later the insights into chiral semiconductors were used to optimize the water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell. Meijer's discovery of ureidopyrimidinone-based supramolecular polymers is a landmark in supramolecular chemistry. He designed a simple quadruple hydrogen-bonded building block that is self-complementary and exhibits a very large association constant. Bringing two of these units together with a spacer resulted in a supramolecular polymer with unprecedented properties. Depending on the conditions applied it on the one hand it possess all the properties of macromolecules, both in solution and solid state, while on the other hand it displays the dynamic nature of organic molecules tied together via non-covalent bonds. Today, the concept of supramolecular polymers is investigated in many international academic and industrial laboratories. The Meijer lab has successfully started the company SupraPolix, offering a supramolecular polymer platform as a key component in several applications, including glue (as superflow elastomers), cosmetics and regenerative medicine of heart valves, for which clinical trials are underway by the Dutch/Swiss company Xeltis. Following up on his discovery Meijer has unraveled the mechanisms behind chemical self-assembly and has proven that supramolecular polymerizations can be classified, based on their mechanism, in a way similar to conventional polymerizations. Current research in the Meijer lab focuses on complex multi-component supramolecular polymer systems and their assembly behaviour Also the potential use of supramolecular polymers is explored as mimics of biological tissue using a modular approach that allows for easy adjustment of their dynamics to external stimuli.  Achievements and awards  border Scientific output and research management Meijer has published over 600 peer reviewed research articles and reviews which have been cited more than 60.000 times, yielding him an H-index of well over 110 . He guided 95 PhD students and more than 25 of his former group members now hold tenured academic professorships worldwide. Meijer has over 20 patents and co-founded the companies SyMO-Chem, a professional contract research company (2000) and SupraPolix, focusing on supramolecular polymers (2003). Since 2006 Meijer is the chairman of the International Scientific Advisory Board of DSM, in 2008 he founded the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems at Eindhoven University of Technology, and he chairs the 27 million euro national Dutch research program into 'Functional Molecular Systems' since 2012.

Named for the two major rivers that flow into the area, the reserve contains public and private lands and waters. The land is primarily coastal prairie with unique oak motte habitats. The wetlands include riparian habitat, freshwater marshes, and saltwater marshes. Within the water areas, the bays are large, open, and include extensive tidal flats, seagrass meadows, mangroves, and oyster reefs. These unique and diverse estuarine habitats in the western Gulf of Mexico support a host of endangered and threatened species including the endangered whooping crane. Traditional activities within the proposed reserve include boating, fishing, hunting, oil and gas extraction, shellfish harvesting, camping and recreational activities. Despite a long history of human uses and its close proximity to the city of Corpus Christi, the reserve is relatively rural and pristine. Jace Tunnell currently serves as director of the reserve.

He participated in the War of the Fourth Coalition as a Rittmeister in the Dragoon regiment of his father, who had died in 1802. After the Treaties of Tilsit, Werther left the army as a Captain due to a reduction in size of the armed forces. For a while, he then became a chamberlain to Friedrich Wilhelm III. Diplomatic career In 1810 Werther joined the diplomatic service. Between 1809 and 1813 he was the Prussian Resident Minister in Constantinople. After that he was envoy to Spain in 1814 and in 1821 envoy and minister plenipotentiary in London. Here he was, amongst other things, significantly involved in the negotiations for the first Anglo- Prussian agreement on shipping in 1823. Then he was posted to Paris between 1824 and 1837. Particularly in the period of the July Revolution in 1830 he played an international balancing role. Although he declined the office of Foreign Minister in 1831, he held this position from 1837 to 1841. Although he had difficulties in holding his ground in domestic politics, he managed to maintain a good relationship with France, and the construction of the railway from Cologne to Antwerp was also something he promoted. In the Oriental Crisis of 1840 Werther opposed the Russian pressure for Prussia to engage herself militarily, as he was of the opinion that in a potential war, due to Austria's military weakness the main burden would fall on Prussia. Life Post Diplomacy After his retirement as Foreign Minister he was head of the department of Neuenburg (Neuch√¢tel). At the same time he belonged to the Prussian Council of State.

The first service was held in the Church in January 1915.Date stone on side of Church The building was initially intended to be the Church Hall and the main Church building was to be built in front on the field. However the parish ran out of money and the hall, which was built of Ellesmere Sandstone with the inside lined with Ruabon brick, was converted into the church and a small hall built next to it, which is now known as the Institute. The field is used for Church Fetes and other events. Fittings and furniture The Church was re-vamped in 2004, for the ninetieth anniversary and to bring it up to code regarding health and safety regulations. A new nave altar was installed and the steps inside altered so that they are smaller. Communion is now taken at the nave altar on Sunday mornings and at the High Altar on Wednesday mornings.

Roller was also a writer of humorist texts and a professor at the \\"Journalistische Hochschule\\" in Berlin. Early life Roller was considered a talented child in school and was the best of his class, yet, being the child of poor parents, he was not able to attend a higher-level school. Instead, although against his wishes, he began an apprenticeship to become a carpenter. In 1859, he became a member of the Berlin craftsmen association and developed an interest for stenography (or shorthand) when he lost a bid for secretary to the board to a candidate who knew shorthand. He then went on to learn stenography from Leopold Arends who taught at the association. In 1869, Roller founded the \\"Stenographisches Institut zur Erteilung von Unterricht und Ausbildung praktischer Stenographen\\" (stenographic institute for the teaching and instruction of practical stenographers) where he taught Arends' stenography system. After conflicts over his role at this institute, he founded the \\"Arendsscher Stenographen- Bund\\" (Arends stenographers' association) and published the \\"Vollst√§ndige Lehrbuch der Volksstenographie (System Arends)\\" (complete textbook of the peoples' stenography (Arends' system)\\" which soon proved to be more popular than Arends' own textbook. Arends' responded first with verbal attacks and then sued Roller but he was acquitted of all charges. Roller's shorthand system Example of Roller's shorthand. As a result of the conflict with Arends, Roller decided to develop his own shorthand system which he published under the title \\"Vollst√§ndiger Leitfaden einer einfachen, in wenigen Stunden erlernbaren Stenographie f√ºr den Schul-, Korrespondenz- und parlamentarischen Gebrauch\\" (complete instructions to a simple, in a few hours learnable stenographic system for school, correspondence and parliament usage) on 1 October 1875. The book was published in 24 editions between 1875 and 1898. Roller made frequent adjustments to the system in the following years. In 1892, Roller released \\"Praktischen K√ºrzungen\\" (practical abbreviations), after having been asked to do so by his supporters, which contained abbreviations for common words used in speeches. In 1902, the now existing \\"Hauptverband der Roller'schen Schule\\" (association of Roller's school [of stenography]) named the system \\"Rollers Weltstenographie\\" (Roller's world stenography). When the Deutsche Einheitskurzschrift was discussed, Roller argued for his system personally. Politics In 1864, Roller became a journalist with the magazine Social‚ÄëDemokrat. In 1865, he became secretary-general of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein (one of the predecessors of the Social Democratic Party of Germany) but quit the job in 1868 because of differences in opinion. He also attended the founding congress of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany in 1869 and chronicled the whole event using shorthand. Career as a writer Besides his work in the field of stenography, Roller published humor texts as well as merry poems and songs under his pen name Roland vom Hochplateau. Death and legacy Roller's tomb stone, engraved with an example of his shorthand system. Roller died on 6 September 1916 in Berlin. His body was buried at the \\"Friedhofspark Pappelallee\\", a cemetery founded by the religious humanist society of Berlin and his tomb stone is one of only few that remain there until today. On 25 November 1925 the Heinersdorfer Stra√üe (1866‚Äì1925) in Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg was renamed to Heinrich-Roller-Stra√üe to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his invention.

Ecological destruction, to which land restoration serves as an antidote, is usually the consequence of pollution, deforestation, salination or natural disasters. Land restoration is not the same as land reclamation, where existing ecosystems are altered or destroyed to give way for cultivation or construction. Land restoration can enhance the supply of valuable ecosystem services that benefit people. Auwahi Dryland Forest Restoration Project on the slopes of Hale'akala on the island of Maui, Hawaii, 2010 Repairing damaged land Land restoration can include the process of cleaning up and rehabilitating a site that has sustained environmental degradation, such as those by natural cause (desertification) and those caused by human activity (strip mining), to restore that area back to its natural state as a wildlife home and balanced habitat. Countering desertification Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) plantations, such as those shown, have played a role in combating edge effects of desertification in the Thar desert, India. Land reclamation in deserts involves *setting up reliable water provisioning (e.g. by digging wells or placing long-distance water pipes) *stabilizing and fixating the soil Stabilizing and fixating the soil is usually done in several phases. The first phase is fixating the soil to such extent that dune movement is ceased. This is done by grasses, and plants providing wind protection such as shelterbelts, windbreaks and woodlots. Shelterbelts are wind protections composed of rows of trees, arranged perpendicular to the prevailing wind, while woodlots are more extensive areas of woodland.Desert reclamation The second phase involves improving/enriching the soil by planting nitrogen-fixating plants and using the soil immediately to grow crops. Nitrogen fixating plants used include clover, yellow mustard, beans, etc., and food crops include wheat, barley, beans, peas, sweet potatoes, date, olives, limes, figs, apricot, guava, tomato, certain herbs, etc. Regardless of the cover crop used, the crops (not including any trees) are each year harvested and/or plowed into the soil (e.g. with clover). In addition, each year the plots are used for another type of crop (known as crop rotation) to prevent depleting the soil on specific trace elements. A recent development is the Seawater Greenhouse and Seawater Forest. This proposal is to construct these devices on coastal deserts in order to create freshwater and grow food.The Sahara Project a new source of freshwater food and energy A similar approach is the Desert Rose concept.Desert Rose - Claverton Group Energy Conference, Bath October 2008 These approaches are of widespread applicability, since the relative costs of pumping large quantities of seawater inland are low.

Details of accident On 12 December 1870, in Barnsley top yard a rake of 10 goods wagons was standing on a gradient of 1 in 119. A single sprag between the spokes of a wheel was holding them. When two gas tank wagons were shunted against the rake, the sprag broke and the 12 wagons began to move. Two pointsmen made valiant efforts to pin down the brakes to no avail. The wagons rapidly gathered speed as the gradient increased to 1 in 72 and passed three signal boxes, none of which had points under their control to deflect the runaways. Meanwhile, a passenger train which had left Barnsley at 18:15 was standing at Stairfoot station one and a half miles away. The runaways struck the rear of the standing train at a speed of at least 40 mph, killing 15 and injuring 59 more. The enquiry by Lieut-Col F. H. Rich found that the goods guard was gravely at fault for not ensuring the standing wagons were better secured. The layout of the yard was also criticized as there were no trap points to protect the running lines in the event of such a mishap.

While most of the area (east and north) is in the London Borough of Haringey, a very small part (west and south) is in the London Borough of Islington. The Stroud Green Road (running WNW-ESE) not only forms the boundary between the two boroughs but is also the area's principal thoroughfare and a busy local shopping street, with many popular restaurants and bars. The Stroud Green Road also represents a border between the ancient ecclesiastical parishes of Islington and Hornsey. At one time, this part of Hornsey parish, and thus Stroud Green, stretched into what is now Hackney, following the present-day Blackstock Road as far as the junction with Mountgrove Road, all beyond the Seven Sisters Road (created c.1832) that today forms Stroud Green's eastern boundary. Here in that former part of Stroud Green was the site of the Eel Pie House, a tavern on the New River (approximately the site of Number 41 Wilberforce Road. When this was demolished in the 1870s another inn, now the Arsenal Tavern took on the name) See p.6 of Stokes, Malcolm (2008) 'The Boundaries of South Hornsey' in Bulletin of the Hornsey Historical Society No 49. . pp. 2-8. then the New River ran above ground at this point. This was originally in a wooden, lead- lined aqueduct - known locally as the Boarded River - but eventually that wooden construction was replaced by a raised earth embankment, atop which the river ran. Nowadays the New River runs underground in this area. Records for Stroud Green date back to the start of the 15th century, but today it seems that nothing remains as physical evidence of Stroud Green's distant past, and the area is now dominated by housing that dates from the late-nineteenth century. Destruction of some parts of Stroud Green was caused by aerial bombing during the Second World War,See BombSight database, http://bombsight.org and this led to the creation, by the then Hornsey Borough Council, of several zones of public housing. Since c.2003 much of Stroud Green has been designated as a Conservation Area (Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990), defining the areas as: \\"the triangular area enclosed by Stroud Green Road and the Haringey/Islington border to the south and west, Mount View Road to the north, and the railway line to the east\\" (see the full rationale below: Twenty-first-century appreciation). This geographical zone seems to mirror the area referred to as Stroud Green throughout the Victoria County History of Middlesex (1980), which, unless otherwise indicated, is used as the basis for much of the historical data provided here.

In the 16th century, part of Stroud Green was owned by John Draper (d. 1576), brewer of London. At his death in 1576 John Draper's estate consisted of between Stroud Green Road and Brownswood (the area around present-day Brownswood Road, south of Finsbury Park) and between the latter and Green Lanes. It was held variously by his heirs, presumably his sons in 1577, descending by his eldest son Thomas (d.1612), to the latter's sons Thomas (d. 1631), Robert (d.1642), and Roger. In 1636 it was held jointly by Thomas's widow Lady (Sarah) Kemp, Robert, and Roger and by 1656 by Roger alone. It was apparently among the lands that he devised to his brother Robert's son Thomas (d.1703), later a baronet, who apparently alienated it. Sir William Paul of Bray (Berks.), Bt. (d. 1686), owned . This portion of Stroud Green was then held by his widow, who married Sir Formedon Penystone, Bt., c.1709, and it passed under Sir William's will to the Paul family. It was presumably among the property inherited from William Paul before 1727 by his daughter Catherine, wife of Sir William Stapleton, 4th Baronet (d. 1740), which apparently then descended to her son Sir Thomas Stapleton, Bt. (d. 1781). By 1796, however, the western portion of was held by a Mr. Lucas, who was succeeded in 1808 by John Lucas, who was the owner in 1822. It belonged to a William Lucas in 1823 and was enfranchised for James Lucas in 1856. It was owned by Joseph Lucas between 1861 and 1876 and was finally built over by 1880.'Hornsey, including Highgate: Growth before the mid-19th century' in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 107-111.

The Corporation of Stroud Green 18th-century London newspapers record details of a group known as the Corporation of Stroud Green. > On Monday the Ancient Corporation of Stroud Green held the annual feast at > Mr. Dobney's near the New-river-head, at which were present upwards of two > hundred members; after which Mr Kelly of Chancery-lane was elected Mayor for > the year ensuing, and an elegant entertainment was provided on the occasion. > (Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser (London) Thursday 2 August 1764; Issue > 11 042) Other newspaper reports show that such so-called Corporations were not unusual at this time, and indeed formed something of an informal regional network, for in 1754 the following item was reported in the London press: > Last Monday evening the Mayor, Sheriffs and Aldermen of Stroud Green paid > their annual Visit to the Mayor, Sheriffs and Aldermen of Kentish Town, at > their Council-Chamber at the Bell in Little Shire-lane, near Temple Bar; > when the Healths of his Majesty, and all the Royal family, were drank, under > a triple Discharge of their Canon, and the night was concluded with the > greatest Demonstrations of joy and Friendship by the Gentlemen of both of > the loyal Corporations. > (Public Advertiser (London) Wednesday 20 November 1754; Issue 6259) Their purpose seems to have been (at least in part) an annual beating of bounds relating to the establishment of property ownership. Thus, the Corporation may be a manifestation of the copyholders of Highbury Manor (already mentioned). The establishment of property rights, even today, is an important and serious matter for those concerned, but in Stroud Green it seems that its undertaking was (occasionally) not without a funny side, as is apparent from an account of the following year's meeting: > On Monday last, according to annual Custom, the Mayor, and Aldermen of the > respectable Corporation of Stroud Green held their Court of Conservancy at > Stapleton Hall (the capital Mansion on what is humorously called their > Estate) near Mount Pleasant, where a sumptuous Repast was prepared for their > reception of their present Sheriffs. After Dinner several loyal Healths were > drank, and the Hall resounded with the names of Granby and Pitt. The whole > was conducted with all [reasonable] Decorum; but what contributed in a great > Measure to damp their Satisfaction was the lnebriety of his Worship's Sword- > Bearer, who having imbibed large Drenches of Claret and Hock, was rendered > unfit to scale the Gates and Stiles belonging to their Grounds, which, in a > formal Procession, they yearly Survey, and by tumbling over Neck and Heels, > unhappily lost the Insigne of his Office, viz. a Gold Sword about four > inches long, of no inconsiderable Value. > (Public Advertiser (London) Friday 5 July 1765; Issue 9624) Whatever the Corporation's official tasks might have been, they always seem to have had a good time: > On Monday last the mayor, aldermen and recorder of Stroud Green, assisted by > the sheriffs, held a court of conservancy, according to ancient custom, at > the Green Man on Stroud Green, known by the name of Stapleton Hall, where an > elegant entertainment was provided by the mayor, and many loyal toasts were > drank in honour of his Majesty's birthday. After dinner they returned to > their mansion house, the Crown, in the lower-street, Islington, and the > evening concluded with a ball, and every demonstration of joy suitable to > the happy occasion. > (Middlesex Journal or Chronicle of Liberty (London) Tuesday 6 June 1769; > Issue 29) The last evidence of the Corporation (at least in newspaper sources) shows that c.1775-76 the organisation was meeting at the London Spaw tavern in Clerkenwell, followed by an evening at the nearby Sadlers Wells theatre.Such newspapers references can be found in the British LIbrary's online database of 17th- and 18th-century newspapers The move was probably the result of the sale of the Green Man tavern at Stapleton Hall in August 1769, when it seems to have reverted to use as a farm house.

To the south, Stapleton Hall stood alone at Stroud Green, near to recently enclosed common land, and Hornsey Wood House (in what is now the park of Finsbury Park). Several cottages were in Wood Lane, near the present day Seven Sisters Road. A path led south-west to a bridge over the New River. Here, facing Blackstock Road, had stood since before 1804 the old Eel-Pie house A brief history of Eel Pie House has been written up on the Harringay Online website - History of Eel Pie House., later (by 1847) the Highbury Sluice House tavern, with riverside gardens and the sluice-house itself immediately to the south. Other than those, and houses in 'South Hornsey detached' (now the area of Brownswood Road, south of Finsbury Park), there was nothing else south of the so-called 'Northern Hog's Back', a ridge of land that runs roughly west south-west to east north-east from Highgate to the present-day Harringay (West) station, the highest part of Stroud Green that borders Crouch End. In effect, modern-day Stroud Green dates from the 19th century. New building at first was slow, perhaps partly because of poor sewerage, until the 1860s. Stapleton Hall remained the only house in Hornsey between Crouch End and Seven Sisters Road as late as 1861, but the streets of Islington were fast approaching towards Stroud Green Road, along the east side of which now stood several large houses. Rapid growth followed the opening of local stations at Seven Sisters Road (Finsbury Park), Crouch Hill, and Crouch End, as well as the new Stroud Green station. In 1863 Joseph Lucas of Stapleton Hall leased land for building and in 1868 Mount Pleasant Road (now Mount Pleasant Crescent and Mount Pleasant Villas) had been built from the Stroud Green Road along the western edge of the Stapleton Hall farmyard, and over the Tottenham & Hampstead Junction Railway. In due course the Edgware, Highgate & London Railway would traverse that part of the road that is now Mount Pleasant Villas (see 'Railways', below). Houses on Stapleton Hall Road, in March 2008 Building development in Stroud Green was so rapid that the 1871 census was already considered unreliable by 1875, yet country houses were still being built in other parts of Hornsey parish until the 1880s; Muswell Hill and Fortis Green were still little altered by 1891. It was during the building boom of the 1870s that Stroud Green had started to become part of an (even today) ill-defined urban area called Finsbury Park, which included Brownswood Park and parts of Islington. There were 25 houses in Mount Pleasant Road in 1871. To the south, a grid of streets was already planned in 1868 and Osborne Road and Albert Road and Upper Tollington Park contained 49 houses in 1871, by which time the roads in the angle of land bordered by Stroud Green Road and the Great North Railway were largely built up. Stapleton Hall Road had been laid out by 1876 and Ferme Park Road was driven over the 'Northern Hog's Back' ridge towards Tottenham Lane in 1880. By 1877 Stroud Green was a new and fast-growing neighbourhood with a strong community feeling and its own newspaper. It was now inhabited mainly by commuters with third- and second-class season tickets. Stroud Green Road c.1910 The adjacent area of Harringay was built-up in the 1880s, while nearby Ferme Park and the Crouch Hall estate were partly built up by 1894. By 1894 there was a street fire station in Stapleton Hall Road, Stroud Green, and there were 26 alarm posts throughout the district. Building continued as late as 1893 in Stapleton Hall Road and in 1896 the area was virtually built up. No more building was possible. 20th-century decline In Stroud Green between 1901 and 1911, the population steadily fell. The declining size of families, however, permitted multiple occupation of houses and the provision of flats, which were associated with lower standards as early as 1900. Subdivision of houses caused concern by 1911, not only in Stroud Green but also in North and South Harringay. In 1921 1.35 families on average lived in each house, the trend being especially marked in the south and east and in 1923 linked to working- class immigration from Islington and correlated with a recent increase in poor-law cases. At Stroud Green houses were heavily divided and the district was in decay by c.1925. Wall Court (built 1947), facing Stroud Green Road, in April 2008 Hornsey as a whole was heavily bombed during the Second World War, when over 80 per cent of the houses suffered damage. Hornsey Council's first major post-war rebuilding was at Stroud Green, where most of the land between Victoria Road, Stroud Green Road, and Lorne Road and Upper Tollington Park was cleared. Facing the main road Wall Court, a balconied block much admired when new, was completed in 1947, Lawson, Wiltshire, and Marquis courts and Brackenbury were built in Osborne Road in 1948, and flats in Nichols Close between 1948 and 1952. Wisbech and Fenstanton date from 1953, the flats and shops of Charter Court from 1954, and Hutton Court from 1960. In 1948 Ronaldshay and Wallace Lodge, on opposite corners of Florence and Wallace roads, and Ednam House facing them were built and in 1952 an extension to Ronaldshay was finished. Carlton Court, 64 flats in Carlton Road, dates from 1947. On opposite corners of Oakfield and Connaught roads Connaught Lodge and Churchill Court were completed in 1949 and on the corner of Oakfield and Stapleton Hall roads Norman Court was completed in 1947. The cul-de-sac Osborne Grove was replaced by an old people's home by 1973. In 1974 Ennis and Woodstock roads were reprieved from demolition and in 1976 several yellow- brick terraced houses were being renovated.'Hornsey, including Highgate: Growth from the mid-19th century' in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 111-122.

Stroud Green is now regarded as an area of \\"special character or historic interest, the character and appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\\", Section 69 (1)(a) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The rationale for this decision was as follows: > The late 19th-century residential development in Stroud Green represents > Haringey's most diverse examples of Victorian domestic architecture > concentrated in any one area. The triangular area enclosed by Stroud Green > Road and the Haringey/Islington border to the south and west, Mount View > Road to the north-west, and the railway line to the east, includes a > significant variety of 19th-century house types. These range from elegantly > crafted artisans cottages to Gothic-revival and Italianate-renewal terraces, > to Queen Anne style semi-detached houses. Mount Pleasant Crescent, in March > 2008.The architecture of the initial phases of development varies to reflect > the Victorian styles in vogue at the time. The early three-storey 1870s > houses along Upper Tollington Park, Florence Road, Victoria Road, and Mount > Pleasant Villas, for example, are predominantly Gothic. They display pointed > or round arch windows with Venetian carved foliage, polychromatic brickwork > and prominent gables with ornamental bargeboards. Other houses from the same > period, and in the same streets, are plainer and combine more subtle Gothic > detailing with classically inspired features such as Italianate eaves. A > particularly attractive street from the first phase of development is Mount > Pleasant Crescent, which is lined by two-storey terraces. These compact > dwellings are exceptional for their attractive tri-partite Venetian-style > windows with contrasting red brick arcades, and slender cast-iron columns. > The second phase of building, along the south-eastern slopes of the Hog's > Back ridge, was delayed for several years by the landowner, Charles Turner > of Stapleton Hall who strongly resisted development near his estate. When > building finally began after Turner's death in 1882, the prominent house > style in England has moved away from the Gothic-inspired houses of the 1870s > towards the Norman Shaw influenced 'Queen Anne' style that would dominate > the 1890s and early 20th century. The change in style is evident along the > north part of Stapleton Hall Road, and in the streets beyond, where the > houses are characterised by the use of red brick throughout, simple canopied > porches, and multi-panelled decorative sash windows. The open setting of the > Hog's Back ridge is used to its full advantage and development here is > generally less dense than in the first phase. Trees, hedges, and planting > add considerably to the setting of the houses and are in the spirit of the > 'Sweetness and Light' philosophy behind the Queen Anne style. In general the > architecture of Stroud Green remains intact and has survived the damaging > changes that have eroded the character of other neighbourhoods in the > borough, e.g. replacement windows, loss of boundary walls, unsympathetic > cladding &c.; It is a unique example of a small area exhibiting the full > range of domestic building styles from around 1870 to the end of the 19th > century.See Proposed Stroud Green Conservation Area, issued in 2003 by Mike > Dunn (Haringey Council Conservation Officer). Online resource, accessed 30 > December 2018 Transport Roads The principal thoroughfare through the area is called Stroud Green Road. It has ancient origins, and formed part of an ancient route out of London, which forks east of Stroud Green at Clissold Park. The fork to the right (known as Green Lanes) extended along the whole eastern edge of Hornsey parish towards Bush Hill, Enfield and was turnpiked in 1789 in spite of Hornsey's opposition. The left fork followed the 'old' road which stretched north-westward to Crouch End via Mountgrove Road (Gipsy Lane in 1872), Blackstock Road (still called Boarded River Lane in 1849), Stroud Green Road, and Crouch Hill. These last two were known as Tallingdon Lane between 1593 and 1795. In 1795, Tallingdon Lane was noted as a rough track, which Blackstock Road apparently still was in 1832. The junction of Stroud Green Road with Seven Sisters Road in 1862, from a map by Edward Stanford. Given the low-lying nature of the area, and the heavy London-clay soil, it is not surprising that roads were susceptible to bad weather. In the 14th century roads in Hornsey parish were said to be impassable in winter. There were legacies towards maintaining main routes through the area, such as Brokhersthill (perhaps Crouch Hill), and the way from Highgate to St. Mary's church, and other local byways. However, in general it seems that maintenance suffered because Hornsey shared the responsibility for many of its far-flung roads with other authorities; not least, in the case of Stroud Green Road, with the neighbouring parish of Islington, which shared a border here. Repairs to Stroud Green Road, were remembered as bad in 1593, while statute duty was often neglected in the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly in the period 1679 to 1686, and in 1792 another attempt was made to exact labour rather than money to try to improve the situation. Thus, for example, in March 1764, it was reported: > The inhabitants of Crouch End, Mount Pleasant and Stroud Green, have come to > a resolution, by a voluntary subscription, to repair the roads from the > first-mentioned place to the last, which at present are in a very ruinous > condition, a great number of men being employed for that purpose. > (Lloyd's Evening Post (London) Monday 12 March 1764; Issue 1041) In 1811 it was noted that the road was well made with 'quickset hedges on both sides',Gay, Ken (2002) Stroud Green and Finsbury Park: A Walk. London : Hornsey Historical Society. . p. 1. but such positive reports seem to be few. Throughout the 19th century disputes continued between the parishes of Hornsey and Islington over the maintenance of the Stroud Green Road.See pp. 6-7 of Stokes, Malcolm (2002) 'The Parish Boundary Between Hornsey and Islington' in Bulletin of the Hornsey Historical Society No 43. . pp. 2-8. It is still the case today that confusion, delays, and occasional wrangles arise over jurisdiction and maintenance of the Stroud Green Road, with the eastern side the responsibility of Haringey Council, and the western side that of Islington Council. \` In 1832 the Seven Sisters Road was built as a turnpike from Islington in a north-easterly direction across the junction of Stroud Green Road with Blackstock Road, towards Tottenham. Some of the other new streets built in the 19th century were also important lines of communication. Endymion Road, built c.1875 under the Finsbury Park Act of 1857, connected Stroud Green and Green Lanes north of Finsbury Park, while the new Ferme Park Road, c.1885, joined Tottenham Lane and Stroud Green.'Hornsey, including Highgate: Communications' in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 103-107.

An interesting survival from an earlier age is the 19th-century, brick-cobbled road surface comprising the first of Mount Pleasant Crescent, at the junction with the Stroud Green Road, and seemingly as good now as the day it was first laid. Railways Stroud Green is currently served by two railway stations: at the south-east end of Stroud Green is Finsbury Park station and at the north-western end Crouch Hill station. The now defunct Stroud Green railway station is discussed below, in the section Interesting (but absent) Buildings. Education Education of yesteryear In 1659 Roger Draper of Stroud Green left ¬£120 to apprentice six poor boys of Hornsey to freemen of London in trades other than those of silk-weaver, tailor, and vintner; premiums of ¬£15 for the master and ¬£5 for clothing and equipping the boy were to be paid, not more than two each year.'Hornsey, including Highgate: Charities for the poor' in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 199-205.

By 1899 it had been bought by a local draper, a Welshman called David Hall, who soon acquired the two adjacent properties (173 and 177), to create a large shop on the ground floor.Gay, Ken (2000) Stroud Green and Finsbury Park: A Walk. London : Hornsey Historical Society. . p. 30. In 1890, Stroud Green had at least 21 private schools, including the forerunners of St. Aidan's Primary School and Hornsey High School for Girls, and there were two denominational grammar schools for boys. The Anglo-French high school, established c.1884, had 100 pupils of all ages in Ferme Park Road in 1889 and opened a girls' branch in Ridge Road in 1890. 34 Stapleton Hall Road, once home to part of the Stapleton Hall Road School for Girls, as seen in May 2008Stapleton Hall School for Girls, at no. 54 and later also at no. 34 Stapleton Hall Road, was run by the Misses Elfick from 1898 or earlier, until 1935. It seems reasonable, therefore, to conjecture that this school had moved to Stapleton Hall Road from 175 Stroud Green Road (see above). 54 Stapleton Hall Road, once home to part of the Stapleton Hall Road School for Girls, as seen in May 2008.At the northern end of Crouch Hill by 1898 there were schools at nos. 102 and 104, called Durham House and Cecile House, no. 110, preparatory and kindergarten departments of Cecile House, and no. 112, Darra House. Other schools in Stroud Green included Hornsey Rise College, Victoria Road, in 1872, Rothbury House college, for day- boys, in 1879, and Victoria College, Florence Road, in the 1880s. Frederick Newcombe, who conducted a collegiate school in Muswell Hill Road, apparently had moved from Stroud Green. The site of the original Stroud Green and Hornsey High School for Girls is now the playground of St Aidan's primary school, as seen in March 2008Stroud Green and Hornsey High School for Girls, was opened by the Church Schools' Co. in 1887. It occupied a cramped site, on the corner of Stapleton Hall and Albany roads, and had no playground in 1906, when there were 150 places and 111 pupils. The school, subsidized by the company to supplement the fees, was taken over by local governors in 1919 and grant aided by Middlesex County Council from 1928. It became an elementary, Voluntary Controlled school in 1948 on the removal of older girls to Hornsey High School for Girls, and was renamed St. Aidan's. A new building was opened in 1972 but the old yellow-brick hall was retained. The site of the original Stroud Green (Girls) High School is now an apartment block, as seen in March 2008The nearby Stroud Green (Girls) High School (c.1887) was a private venture established by a Mrs. Mills-Carver and comprised a new building at the corner of Addington and Oakfield roads, with its grounds backing those of the teachers' and boarders' houses. In 1906 there were 150 places and 130 pupils of all ages, including six boarders whose payments were needed for solvency. Competition with the nearby Stroud Green and Hornsey High School for Girls was mutually damaging but plans for amalgamation had to wait until 1948. Meanwhile, in 1908 Stroud Green (Girls) High School was taken over by Middlesex County Council to become Hornsey High School for Girls, a counterpart to the Stationers' (boys) School and in 1915 it moved to new buildings nearby its new partner. In 1948 it eventually succeeded in absorbing the Stroud Green and Hornsey High School for Girls, whose former site became St Aidan's primary school. In 1972 Hornsey High School for Girls became a girls comprehensive school located in entirely new premises in Crouch End, its former premises were acquired by the Stationers' school. St. Peter-in-Chains Roman Catholic school for infants was open by 1959 in Elm Grove, close to St. Gilda's junior school. Originally independent, it was Voluntary Aided in 1969 and had 206 infants on the roll in 1975. The position for those reliant on free education was more precarious. A report of 1890 showed that secondary education for the sons of the poor of Stroud Green was being provided by local churches. A grammar school for 'sons of parents of limited means' occupied an iron room adjoining Holy Trinity church, Stroud Green, in 1890. It had a junior department in 1909, when prospectuses were available at the Vicarage. A Baptist grammar school used the Victoria Hall, Stapleton Hall Road, also in 1890. Until the end of the 19th century there was no free, State provision in Stroud Green for younger children. Indeed, in 1890 middle-class families around Oakfield Road opposed any public elementary school. Similar hostility was later shown on the Harringay Park estate, where house purchasers were not told by the British Land Co. that the local school board as early as 1883 had bought a site between Falkland and Frobisher roads. Attacked by builders and householders in both areas and by the vicars of St. Paul's and Holy Trinity, the board wavered throughout the 1880s. Meanwhile, elementary-age Stroud Green children were forced to attend schools in neighbouring education authorities, becoming known as 'border children'. Tottenham had over 100 Hornsey pupils in 1889 the problem of 'border children' grew worse, and the London board eventually refused admission to 200 Stroud Green pupils in 1892, prompting the Education Department to remonstrate with Hornsey. Stroud Green Board School eventually opened in temporary buildings in Stroud Green Road in 1894. From 1896 it used a new building in Woodstock Road, with accommodation for 1,351 boys, girls, and infants on separate floors. It was designed by Arnold Mitchell and A. M. ButlerGay, Ken (2000) Stroud Green and Finsbury Park: A Walk. London : Hornsey Historical Society. . p. 13. and built by Kirk & Randall building contractors.Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org), March 1896, trial of CHARLES LAWRENCE (46) (t18960323-290). There were 1,052 places by 1932, when the school was reorganized into a senior mixed or secondary modern school with 346 places, a junior mixed with 408, and an infants' with 344. The seniors were later absorbed into Bishopswood, leaving the board's building to Stroud Green junior and infants' schools, with 320 and 180 children on their rolls in 1975. Under the Education Act of 1902 Hornsey became a Part III authority, responsible for elementary education. The new education committee, met from 1903 until 1920 at no. 206 Stapleton Hall Road. The committee took pride in relatively small classes, taught only by qualified teachers with good salaries. It vainly sought responsibility for secondary education in 1904 and conducted its own census into the needs of children beyond the age of 15 in 1905‚Äì6. Finding that provision was dependent on private schools, Hornsey co-operated closely with Middlesex County Council in taking over and enlarging the poorer ones. Funds from the Pauncefort charity were available from 1903 to support three, later five, girls at secondary schools and a further income was derived from the Hornsey educational foundation. Advanced courses were introduced at elementary schools, Stroud Green and South Harringay, in 1920 and extended in 1923.'Hornsey, including Highgate: Education' in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 189-199.

Religion Anglicans The first Anglican church of Holy Trinity, Stroud Green, was built in stages between 1880 and 1885 on the corner of Granville and Stapleton Hall roads, and replaced a crowded temporary hall. Holy Trinity, Stroud Green had become a separate district in 1881, assigned from the chapelries of Holy Innocents and St. John and from Hornsey parish. The original Holy Trinity, Stroud Green Designed in a 13th-century style by B. E. Ferrey (son of the more well known architect Benjamin Ferrey), it was of brick with stone dressings and had a nave, south aisles, transepts, vestry, south porch, and west spirelet. Interior view of the west end of the original Holy Trinity, Stroud Green Although built at only moderate cost, the interior was dignified and spacious. There were 1,200 seats in 1903, when a morning service was attended by 1,051 and an evening service by 1,210. Following war damage the church was declared unsafe c.1951 and pulled down in 1960. The site was re-used for a hall, Vicarage, and public garden. The adjoining red-brick hall (1913) by J. S. Alder, in Granville Road, was adapted as the church, with a western portico and spirelet. The church's organ went to Saint Andrew's, Surbiton. Holy Trinity church, Granville Road, as seen in March 2008The congregation was evangelical in 1885, when 2,266 signatories opposed the presentation of the ritualist, Dr. Robert Linklater, vicar 1885‚Äì1911. By 1888, however, Holy Trinity was the only Hornsey church with Anglo-Catholic services. The church continues to be firmly within the catholic tradition of the Church of England, as to which see the church's website (below). The current parish boundaries were fixed in the 1980s when the benefice of Holy Trinity, Stroud Green was merged with that of the now defunct St Luke's, Hornsey. The patron is the Bishop of London.'Hornsey, including Highgate: Churches' in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 172-182.

() p.26 Roman Catholics St Peter-in-Chains Catholic church, Womersley Road, as seen in March 2008In 1893 some Roman Catholic residents of Stroud Green formed the Stroud Green Catholic Association, and began to raise funds for a church. Coombe House, at the corner of Womersley and Dashwood roads, was bought in 1894, when mass was celebrated there. It was designated St. Augustine's, since canons regular of St. Augustine were intended to serve the mission, but was soon committed to canons regular of the Lateran, who changed the name to St. Peter-in-Chains. A red-brick church, in a Gothic style, was founded in 1898 and completed in 1902. There were attendances of 473 in the morning and 125 in the evening on one Sunday in 1903. The church was still served by canons regular of the Lateran in 1976.'Hornsey, including Highgate: Roman catholicism' in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980) pp. 182-183.

Congregationalists The site of the Stroud Green Congregational church at the crossing of Granville Road and Mount View Road, as seen in March 2008A Congregational church was founded to serve Stroud Green, on land at the corner of Mount View Road and Granville Roads, which was acquired with help from the local Park, Highgate, and Tollington Park Congregational chapels. A hall was opened in 1887 and used for worship until the completion of a building in the Decorated style, of red brick faced with terracotta, which in 1893 was to seat 1,000. The pastorate was said to be prosperous and on one Sunday in 1903 there were attendances of 330 in the morning and 231 in the evening. The church was closed and demolished in 1935.

For a detailed history see: Hinshelwood, John (1999)The Old Dairy at Crouch Hill. London : Hornsey Historical Society. Stapleton Hall Stapleton Hall is situated on Stapleton Hall Road near the junction with Hanley Road, Stroud Green Road, Mount Pleasant Crescent and Crouch Hill. There are two quite different opinions about the ownership of this building. The older opinion, first published in the Gentleman's Magazine of November 1784 states that the Stapeleton Hall took its name from having been the property of and residence of Sir Thomas Stapleton.John Hinshelwood, (2010) 'Stapleton Hall, Stroud Green; the myth exposed',Hornsey Historical Society Bulletin 51, pp. 4-9, at p.5 A subsequent history of Islington published in 1811, elaborates this notion, stating: > there is an old farm house called Stapleton Hall, and which was formerly the > property and residence of Sir Thomas Stapleton, of Grey's Court, in the > county of Oxon, Bart. an antient family, remarkable for the number of > eminent men it has produced. In the building are his initials, with those of > his wife, and the date 1609. This story is further explored in the Victoria County History (op.cit), which states that the building was first mentioned in 1577, and was extended or rebuilt in 1609 by Sir Thomas Stapleton whose initials appeared on date stones and panelling. The Victoria County History also asserts that a Sir William Stapleton, Bt., was the landowner until his death in 1745, and the property then apparently passed to Sir Thomas Stapleton, Bt. (d. 1781). A more recent opinion, expressed in the March 2010 Bulletin of the Hornsey Historical Society, using more archival and architectural evidence, makes a compelling case that the original owners of the property were in fact the Draper family, already local landowners (see the section on Local landownership, above).John Hinshelwood, (2010) 'Stapleton Hall, Stroud Green; the myth exposed',Hornsey Historical Society Bulletin 51, pp.4-9, at p. 8. As has been shown in the section above, about the Corporation of Stroud Green, by the 1760s the building was in use as a tavern, sometimes known as The Green Man. In 1759 the death of the landlord was reported: > Mr Rogers, master of the Green Man at Stroud Green. As he was riding thro' > Islington he dropt from his horse, and expired immediately. > Universal Chronicle or Weekly Gazette (London) Saturday 9 June 1759; Issue > 63) In August 1769 it was announced that the tenant, a Mrs. Rogers (who was presumably the widow of Mr Rogers), was to auction the contents, which gives us a nice impression of the place: > All the genuine Household Furniture, Fixtures &c;, belonging to Mrs. Rogers, > at the Green Man at Stroud Green, near Mount Pleasant, in the parish of > Hornsey; consisting of 14 bedsteads with furnitures, featherbeds and bedding > to ditto, two eight-day clocks, a large quantity of kitchen furniture, a > brewing copper, and the utensils of the brew-house, sundry ranges, and other > fixtures, two carts, three fine cows, two pigs and sundry other effects. > (Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser (London) Saturday 26 August 1769; Issue > 12 632) Stapleton Hall as it appeared in April 2008, the original building now painted white. At some point before 1776 it appears to have been functioning as a farm for then a sale notice states: > Messr ELDERTON give notice, that the Lease of the Farm, late Mr Seddon's, > jun. known by the name of Stapleton Hall at Stroud Green near Holloway, > between Islington and Highgate, will be put up for sale [...] after which > will follow the dispersal of the horses, cows, hogs, farming utensils, and > three very large ricks of extraordinary fine hay. The sale of furniture will > begin precisely at 11 o'clock. > (Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser (London) Thursday, 7 November > 1776; Issue 2330) This history is reflected in the 1811 history of Islington which states that at Stroud Green: > an old farm house called Stapleton Hall [...] was afterwards converted into > a publick house, and within memory had in front the following inscription: > Ye are welcome all To Stapleton Hall. Mr. William Lucas is the present > occupier of the house, together with a farm of more than of land contiguous > thereto. The Stapleton Hall area of Stroud Green in 1862, from the map by Edward Stanford Certainly, press announcements in the later 18th century indicate that Stapleton Hall farm was the venue for a number of agricultural auction sales, mostly of hay and field crops such as oats and barley, and occasionally of farm equipment and furniture. However, from these references it is not possible to know if these last items were the property of the tenants of Stapleton Hall or of nearby properties.Such newspapers references can be found in the British Library's on-line database of 17th- and 18th-century newspapers Between 1856 and 1884 Stapleton Hall was occupied by Charles Turner (d.1892), member of a prominent farming family and later of nearby Womersley House. The hall had become the Stroud Green Conservative club by 1888, and in 1962 was bought by the club, which still occupied it in 1978. In the 1980s it was noted that early-17th century panelling had been reset in a short back wing, and parts of the building may be of that date. The main range is probably 18th- century but was re-fronted in the early- or mid-19th century. More recent alterations have included the demolition of an annexe towards the street and the addition of a modern clubroom at the rear.'Hornsey, including Highgate: Other estates' in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 146-149.

The house has since been much altered and converted into leasehold apartments, with more newly built in the grounds. The telephone exchange The old Stroud Green telephone exchange (1911) as it appeared in May 2008 No 39A Stroud Green Road, despite the fact that it bears the date 1896, was actually built in 1911, filling a gap between the adjacent, previously detached buildings. It is the site of the former National Telephone Company's local exchange, and public call office; an essential public amenity in the days before widespread domestic telephone ownership.Gay, Ken (2000) Stroud Green and Finsbury Park: A Walk.

The old brick building that was immediately on Stroud Green Road (officially 15 The Parade) and until 2008 in use as a factory trading under the name Peter Phillips, was the Scala Cinema (architect H. W. Horsley). It opened in 1914 (replacing the former Stroud Green Hall), and sat 700 people. The auditorium ran parallel with the road, with the rake provided by the gentle, natural drop of the land. In 1920 it was renamed the New Scala Cinema, but closed in 1924.Scala in 'The London Project'.

Stapleton Hall Road Coal Offices These former coal offices on a railway bridge over the Gospel Oak to Barking railway (at the junction of Stapleton Hall Road and Ferme Park Road) were in use until recently as a small dwelling house and a cobblers' shop.

Andrews, to build: > a concert hall in Stroud Green, on the north-west side of Stapleton-hall- > road, Stroud Green, with three shops at the rear to abut upon Mount Pleasant > road [...] as no open spaces are shown to be provided at the rear of the > intended shops [...] but that the applicant be informed that a further > application for consent to the frontage only of the building might be > favourably considered. > The Era (London) Saturday 30 November 1895; Issue 2984)The Era was a weekly > newspaper about theatre, actors, music hall, and all related matters.

A similar notice appeared in the same newspaper, shortly afterwards, on 4 April 1896. On both occasions it was clear that the building works were to be carried out within six months. It is evident from the plans, now in the London Metropolitan Archives, Clerkenwell, EC1.LMA shelfmark: LCC/AR/TH/01/023 that the still-standing, gabled building with the ground-floor curved shop front was already in existence at the time of the proposed development, shown as belonging to Mr Tanner.

(part of the G.N.R. from 1866) opened a line from Finsbury Park through Stroud Green to Edgware, via Highgate, with later branches to Alexandra Palace and High Barnet. In 1881 the Stroud Green station was opened in Stapleton Hall Road. A local branch line linking Highgate and Alexandra Palace was opened in 1873, but was then closed the same year after the destruction of the palace by fire. It re-opened in 1875 with a new station at Muswell Hill, but continued to be closed for varying periods on several occasions up to 1952. In 1954 the whole of the line from Finsbury Park to Highgate and beyond was closed to passenger traffic; freight services continued to Muswell Hill until 1956 and to Highgate and Finchley until 1964, the track to the Alexandra Palace being taken up in 1958 and to Highgate in 1970. The track between the station at Finsbury Park and Highgate is now a pedestrian, public right of way called the Parkland Walk. Womersley House Womersley House, as it was at the start of the 20th century While strictly speaking not properly part of Stroud Green, Womersely House, close by the St Peter-in-Chains catholic church, has already been noted as home to the Turner family, prominent local landowners in the late 19th century, who had previously occupied Stapleton Hall. By the early 20th century however it was a hostel for single working women.'A New Hostel for Women' in Selections from the Girls' Own Paper 1880-1907 Doughty, Terri (2004) Toronto : Broadway Press. . 157-59 It occupied a plot of land bordered by Elm Grove and Womersley Road, and was finally demolished in the 1960s.

The management of waste in New Zealand has become more regulated to reduce associated environmental issues. History Until recently, waste was taken to local rubbish dumps with little or no control as to where they were sited. Often the dumps were close to water ways. In recent years the location of dumps was consolidated and they are now constructed as sanitary landfills to prevent leaching of the contents into water bodies. Transfer stations, especially in cities, act as a local collection point where the waste is compacted before being transported to the nearest landfill. In 2007 the OECD Environmental Performance Reviews for waste gave the following recommendations: *develop national regulations for managing hazardous waste *expand and upgrade waste treatment and disposal facilities *increase regulatory support for recovery or recycling *clarify liability arrangements for remediation of contaminated sites Mass 1.6 million tonnes per year is generated from the construction and demolition industry which represents 50% of total waste to landfills https://www.branz.co.nz/cms_display.php?st=1&sn;=113. Christchurch Graffiti about waste on a garage door in Christchurch (2009). Waste volumes from kerbside collections was almost 40,000 tonnes but reduced after the introduction of kerbside recycling and a halving in the number of free rubbish bags. In 2009 the Council introduced 140 litre wheelie bins for kerbside collection after which waste volumes began to rise. Types  Agricultural plastics  Agriculture is one of the largest sectors of the economy in New Zealand and consequently a large volume of waste is produced in relation to other industries. Collection of containers that contained agricultural chemicals is carried out in some regions. The burning of plastic waste was made illegal in recent years due to the release of toxic pollutants. ;Construction waste  Electronic waste  Electronic waste is an increasing part of the waste stream and the Ministry for the Environment are investigating ways of dealing with it. The annual eDay, which started from a trial in 2006, is used as means of collecting electronic waste for reuse or recycling.  Food waste  The total volume of food wasted in New Zealand is not known. Research was conducted in 2014 into food waste, generated by households, that was disposed of through curbside rubbish collections. The study found that 229,022 tonnes of food is sent to landfill by households annually. Of this approximately 50% or 122,547 tonnes is avoidable food waste. The cost of avoidable household food waste disposed of to landfill in 2014/2105 was $872 million pa. A detailed report available on the WasteMINZ website provides more information into household food waste. No research has been undertaken to date into commercial or supply chain food waste.http://www.wasteminz.org.nz/sector-groups/behaviour-change/national- food-waste-prevention-project/ Waste reduction Recycling bins in Christchurch, New Zealand By 1996 the New Zealand cities of Auckland, Waitakere, North Shore and Lower Hutt had kerbside recycling bins available. In New Plymouth, Wanganui and Upper Hutt recyclable material was collected if placed in suitable bags. By 2007 73% of New Zealanders had access to kerbside recycling. Kerbside collection of organic waste is carried out by the Mackenzie District CouncilOptions for Kerbside Collection of Household Organic Wastes ‚Äì Appendix 1: Kerbside Kitchen Waste Collections in New Zealand [Ministry for the Environment] and the Timaru District Council.

Biography Madonna with child and St. Anne, 1630. Dirk's father Hans (1568‚Äì1605) emigrated to Dordrecht after Dirk was born. Dirk's family were Mennonite refugees. In the Spanish Netherlands Anabaptism was illegal since the siege of Antwerp in 1585. He became apprenticed to a silversmith, and learned drawing and engraving, but according to Houbraken he wanted to learn the new German method of gold- and silver- plating, so he undertook a journey to Germany. Dirck van Hoogstraten Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature There he met some Dutch painters and became more drawn to drawing and painting. He stayed on there some years with success. Houbraken tells of an instance where he fell ill and the woman who let him a room tended to him and sent for the priest. He spat out the sacramental bread, because he didn't want to die a Catholic, and this was found later under his bed by the woman, and at Easter she told him he had to move out. When he returned home his father was astonished that his son was not a master smith, but a master painter. According to the RKD he travelled to Italy in 1623 and became a member of the Dordrecht Guild of St. Luke in 1624, where he also married in 1626.Dirck van Hoogstraten in the RKD Paintings Very few works remain by Dirk van Hoogstraten. Houbraken claims he made a print from his own drawing called \\"Ecce Homo\\" that was quite good. Though little work remains that is attributed to him, he is known for prints, drawings and paintings, as well as some gold- and silver-smith work. Besides his sons Samuel and Jan, he was the teacher of the painters Nicolaes Couwenbergh and Ossewaert.

History  Partners In Aid was established in 1962 with the intention of providing support to rural communities in India and Bangladesh. Initially, the organisation had two paid staff. However, it now operates on a volunteer basis. Early projects involved shipments of livestock, but during the 1980s Partners In Aid policies expanded to include community health and economic development. Current activities are facilitated through partnerships with locally registered, in-country NGOs. When Austcare changed its name to ActionAid Australia after joining ActionAid International as an affiliate, the organisation previously known as \\"Action Aid Australia ‚Äì For Those Who Have Less\\" changed its name to Partners in Aid.  Current board members and advisors  The board of Partners in Aid meets regularly to discuss projects and fund raising activities. Board members include Councillor Amanda Stone http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/Your-Council/Councillors/Amanda- Stone-/ and Dr Graham Moore.http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/about/webpage.php3?login=gamagr Advisors include Joy Handley, who has written about Bangladesh and provides support with Partners in Aid's work with the All Bengal Women's Union,http://www.partnersinaid.org.au/AGM%20Reports%202008.pdf and Dr Cecily Neil, a sociologist who has written extensively about the development sector. The Rev Dr Morris Lee of Symbiosis Internationalhttp://www.symbiosiscanada.ca/about_us/about_us.php is also an advisor., as is Dr Roger Hughes.http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/about/webpage.php3?login=rogerh  Current work  Partners in Aid is an international development agency based in Narre Warren, Australia. The organisation finances small-scale community development projects in Bangladesh, the Philippines and India, as well as running child sponsorship programmes in India. They are a current signatory to the ACFID code of conduct. Partners in Aid is also involved in groups such as Our Community, which aims at capacity building Australian community groups.  Projects in India  According to the website, Partners in Aid works with two NGOs in India - SEDS (Social Education and Development Society) based in Andhra Pradesh, and the All Bengal Women's Union, in Kolkata.http://www.abwu.org/projects.asp?project=sponsorship Partners in Aid assists with watershed management and child sponsorship projects at SEDS. SEDS was established with the aim of helping people living in the drought-prone area of Anantapur District in Andhra Pradesh. Also in India, Partners in Aid assists with the work of the All Bengal Women's Union. Originally established in 1932 by a group of local women to assist exploited women and children in Calcutta,http://www.abwu.org/aboutus.asp the All Bengal Women's Union now has a variety of projects, ranging from an Old Age Women's home, to vocational training, a primary school, a children's welfare home and provision of counselling for children who live in the home.http://www.abwu.org/projects.asp?project=counseling  Projects in Bangladesh  In Bangladesh, Partners in Aid works with an NGO known as Symbiosis. They support two Symbiosis projects - the Jamuna River Development Project (JRDP), and the Training and Information Support Program (known as TTIS). Symbiosis aim to promote human development in harmony with the environment. Most years, the Jamuna River overflows. When the resulting flood water recedes, sandbanks appear. People move to the sandbanks in order to farm the \\"new land\\". The project aims to assist these people and has three components - education, micro-credit and health. The TTIS project aims to enable poor and marginalized men and women learn skills that could give them access to job markets that they would not otherwise have been able to work in. The sewing project of TTIS alone has equipped more than 2,000 women with sewing skills over the last decade.  Project in the Philippines  In the Philippines, Partners in Aid supports the Sinangpad Healthy Village Project. The project's aims include providing information for local communities to improve village sanitation. The project is located in Kalinga province and was taken on by Partners in Aid as it was started by a former member of the Board.http://www.partnersinaid.org.au/0906%20Newsletter.pdf  See also  *Partners in Aid website *Symbiosis website *Social Education and Development Society (SEDS) website *All Bengal Women's Union website *Partners in Aid newsletter catalogue, National Library  References  Category:Development charities based in Australia Category:Foreign charities operating in India Category:Foreign charities operating in Bangladesh Category:Foreign charities operating in the Philippines ","title":"Partners in Aid"},{"id":"24636177","text":"This is a list of transfers that took place during the 2009 Primera Divisi√≥n of Chile season.

He was born in Hoff, Prussian Province of Pomerania to a noble family. He completed his law studies in 1688, after which he entered service with Brandenburg. He attained the rank of general in 1705 and Generalfeldmarschall in 1711. He was appointed ambassador to Warsaw by elector Frederick Augustus of Saxony, who aspired to the throne of Poland-Lithuania which had been vacant since the death of Jan III Sobieski in 1696. By causing competition between the other aspirants, Flemming was able to secure the election of the elector as Augustus II of Poland-Lithuania. Flemming participated in the Livonian campaign of the Great Northern War. His troops captured the fort D√ºna fort at Riga from the Swedes in 1700, renaming it \\"Augustenburg\\" (\\"August's fort\\"), but the Swedes defeated the allied Russian-Saxon army at the crossing of the Daugava in 1701. During the Battle of Klisz√≥w in 1702 he was severely wounded. In 1705 August made him general of the cavalry and Minister of War. At the Treaty of Altranst√§dt in 1706, Charles XII demanded of the deposed August the extradition of Flemming, arguing that he had estates in Swedish Pomerania and was therefore a Swedish citizen subject to Swedish law. Flemming relieved his Elector from this predicament by leaving for Prussia. When the Swedes left Poland in 1708 for their disastrous campaign in Russia (ending with the defeat at Poltava), the re-crowned August installed Flemming in the governor's residence in Dresden. In 1711 Flemming became Generalfeldmarschall and led the Saxon troops in Northern Germany against the Swedes led by Magnus Stenbock. He participated in the sieges of Stralsund and T√∂nning, and led the Saxon troops in the Battle of Gadebusch in 1712. After the victorious end of fighting in northern Germany in 1715, Flemming led the Saxon troops to Poland, supporting Augustus against the Tarnogr√≥d Confederation.

(Dulcop) is an Italian company, founded in 1938, which produces soap bubbles and bubble toys. The company's headquarters is located in San Lazzaro di Savena, Bologna, Italy.  History  The company began in 1938 as La Nuova Dolciaria, a business focused on confectionery for children. La Nuova Dolciaria was purchased by Athos Melotti in 1957, thus beginning the legacy of the Melotti family. Two years later, the company changed its name to DULCOP DI MELOTTI RAG. ATHOS. By 1960, the company branched out and began to produce plastic packaging for confectionery. It was not until 1969 that the first soap bubbles were produced. During this time, plastic toy production was still active as well, but the ‚Äúdolce sorso‚Äù (a sweet beverage inside a baby bottle) remained the company's best seller. Toy soldiers became the core business in 1970, together with the production of brands such as Airfix and Atlantic. Their classic toy soldier evolved into Charlie Kit, which could be found in Ferrero‚Äôs Kinder Surprise, and the Super Charlie hinged soldiers, which were sold separately as action figures. At the end of the decade, in 1979, the company once again changed its name, becoming Dulcop International S.p.A. During the 1980s, production delved into plastic products for the home, which were sold as collectibles. It was not until 1985, due to a change in the market, that Dulcop started to focus on soap bubble production. With their history in plastic molding, production could be completely in-house for the standard 60 ml bottles. Experimentation on bottle size also began at this time. However, from 1985 through 2004, the company also launched a major collaboration with Ferrero. Plastics for Ferrero‚Äôs Kinder Surprise represented 50% of the company‚Äôs turnover during this period. The company created Babbol, a character based on the iconic shape of the 60ml bottles, in 1998. Babbol starred in a series of kids‚Äô comics as well as being used on their own line of graphics. By 2001, with the focus more heavily on bubbles, Dulcop increased their bubble offerings with more soap bubble selections and an expanded bubble toy line. In 2013, it hit a milestone by producing its 1 billionth soap bubble bottle. 2015 saw the installation of a new, more efficient automatized line for production and the establishment of a US subsidiary, Dulcop America, located in Charlotte, North Carolina. 2018 marked the company's 80th year of operations. Dulcop operates with an EC Type Certificate (Type Approval), which it obtained in 2012, as well as a T√úV Rheinland certification, which it obtained in 2014  Dulcop brands  Dulcop currently has two brands: Bubble World and Babbol. The Bubble World line was realized in January 2019. It presents 9 graphics: Color, ABC, Teddy Bear, Sport, Sea, Unicorn, Flamingo, Little Dragons, and Party. The bottles are available in several different sizes and quantities.(PDF, p.16)(PDF, p. 15) Babbol was launched in 2017 for the 60 ml sized bottles in Italy. The bottles come with an app, Real Babbol, which can be scanned from the label. The company called these virtual soap bubbles \\"Neverending bubbles\\".  Dulcop products   Soap bubbles  The classic soap bubble bottle is the 60 ml Standard.1.http://www.dulcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Dulcop-Corriere- Bologna-dicembre-2017.pdf It comes with the ball and maze game on the cap, which became a symbol of the company. The 60 ml is also easily recognizable from the red built-in wand. From 1969, Dulcop realized three additional bottle shapes: Slim (120 ml), Maxi (175 ml) and Glass (300 ml). The bottle shapes are all registered as 3D trademarks. Over the years, the company focused on the enhancement of the product, making the solution hypoallergenic, Kathon- and Gluten- free, and more environmentally-friendly by reducing the plastic in their bottles by 15%. Soap bubble bottles. The ball and maze game on the cap was invented by Dulcop.  National and International Tradeshow Attendance  Spielwarenmesse is the most important tradeshow the company participates in, having joined in 1973 and exhibited every year since. It is the biggest Toy Fair in the world and takes place every year in Nuremberg, (Germany) In the 1960s and 1980s, the company also exhibited at important Fairs such as the Paris and Milan Toy Fair. Starting in 2018, Dulcop began exhibiting at Toys Milano.  Collaborations and initiatives  In 2013, Dulcop joined Emergency and Jaeger-LeCoultre in the project \\"It's time to help Sierra Leone\\". For the occasion, the company was asked to create customized soap bubbles for the Venice Film Festival, to blow on the red carpet. In 2016, Dulcop started a collaboration with the artistic duo Antonello Ghezzi. The two artists created an on-going performance called Blow against the walls, where the attendees to the exhibition have to blow soap bubbles against a wall. The project is a journey around the world, aiming to destroy physical barriers built by humans. The performance was shown in Paris, Athens, Bologna, Beirut, Bahrein, Brussels, and New York City. Dulcop provided the bubbles for the performances. In 2016, Dulcop also teamed up with Disturbo, an Italian cultural association that organizes a photo scavenger hunt in Italy. For the occasion, the company gave the association its soap bubbles to blow during the event.

The military develops and trains , girls who are able to use special genetic tissue called to manifest superhuman fighting skills and weapons. Supporting the Pandoras are male partners called , who use special \\"freezing\\" powers to limit their opponent's mobility. One of these limiters is Kazuya Aoi, whose late sister was a Pandora. While attending West Genetics Academy in Japan, Kazuya meets Satellizer el Bridget, a powerful Pandora, nicknamed the Untouchable Queen, for her ruthless personality and her intense aphephobia. Despite warnings from his schoolmates to keep away from Satellizer, Kazuya befriends her, and asks to be her Limiter. After helping her through several fights against school rivals of varying ranks and classes, Satellizer agrees to partner with him, although she soon encounters a rival in romance named Rana Linchen, who thinks Kazuya is her soulmate. Their rivalry is put aside when the Novas attack their school using Pandoras under their control to access the school's underground lab. Satellizer and Kazuya join a handful of West Genetics students to a research lab in Alaska, where they are to help with the Evolution Pandora (E-Pandora) project. The E-Pandora project allows ordinary girls to undergo Stigmata transplants and become Pandoras. When one of the E-Pandoras goes berserk, the others question whether the drugs in the experiment are safe, but are forced to comply with the director and the corporation's wishes. Upon discovering that they are to be used until they are expendable, the E-Pandora Amelia Evans leads a rebellion which escalates into a full-on Nova Clash. Kazuya learns more about his family's connections to the Pandora and the Nova. Kazuya's grandfather Gengo Aoi launches a similar project, which puts Satellizer and Rana into a special team with girls called Valkyries. However, during the demonstration exercise with custom-designed dummy Nova, the Pandoras experience illusions, and the dummy Novas become a legion of hundreds of Nova that decimate Genetics. Gengo counters this by unleashing the Legendary Pandoras who are Kazuya's aunts. The Chevalier attempt to assassinate Gengo using a group of convicts called the Busters, but the mission falls apart when some of the Legendary Pandoras turn into deadly Novas due to the anti-freezing of the busters, but they are defeated by the power of Kazuya's special freezing, and Arcadia 01, Daughter of Cassandra conceived from Kazuha's father which awakens from stasis in response to her brother's awakened power. Before Chevalier launches another attack, Gengo moves on with his main plan, which involves sending Kazuya to Elca, the world from which the Novas come from to learn the truth about them. During his time there, he discovers that there might be a direct link between the two worlds with relation to Novas, Pandoras, and Limiters. There also appear to be several alternate versions of people he knows on Elca.

Reception  The anime adaption of Freezing has received generally positive reviews. The series' animation, character development and soundtrack were frequently praised, though critics' thoughts on the series' plotline and sexualization was generally more mixed. Davey C. Jones of Active Anime lauded Freezing as a \\"fantastic series that is part sci-fi and a huge part twisted fan service\\", which, \\"despite all the gratuity, the story is solid and had heart.\\" Additional praise was directed at the animation, vibrant characters (including the relationship between Kazuya and Satellizer), as well as the soundtrack, with Jones writing that \\"the anime was great [...] it‚Äôs sick, it‚Äôs twisted, yet somehow also managed to be sweet at times.\\" In a later review of Freezing: The Complete Series (which includes Vibration), Jones continued to praise the characters, storyline, and sexualization, writing that it \\"has the action, the gripping story and wonderful visuals it [Freezing] has come to be known for ‚Äì Freezing will captivate you.\\" Although some criticism was directed at the series' plot holes, the positive reception was echoed by Brian Auxier of Anime Herald, whom praised the strong visuals, noting that \\"scenes burst with color as heroines speed through the air. The animation is clean, and the overall sense of speed is exhilarating.\\" The Funimation English dub was also commended as being fitting, with Auxier concluding that \\"the intense and sexually charged combat scenes are the real centerpiece of the series, and generally eclipse the major faults in storytelling. Fans of action and fan service need to look no farther than Freezing. This one‚Äôs definitely for you.\\" Sequential Tart too opined that the series was highly enjoyable, praising the \\"exciting\\" story, breadth of characters, and the action scenes, with \\"the battles [being] as exciting as they are bloody\\", for a rating of 8 out of 10. Theron Martin of Anime News Network gave the series a B‚àí overall, stating \\"As is, the series is nowhere near as bad as its premise suggested it could have been, and comes off a little better in the end than the initial impression it gives, but its appeal is still not going to extend much beyond the normal crowd of fan service and graphic action aficionados.\\" The writing quality and character development was critiqued as varied, though praise was directed at the visuals. Freezing ranked 14th on a list of \\"36 Titillating Ecchi Anime That Won't Let You Down\\" by anime website GoBoiano. Martin earlier gave Freezing a score of 3.5 out of 5 in his preview of 2011 winter anime, finding the artwork and animation to be very good at times though sometimes inconsistent; however, he opined that \\"any of the series‚Äô other potential weaknesses aren't going to matter if you have a sweet spot for the fan service/violence combo, though, as on that front it scores big-time.\\" Carl Kimlinger, also of Anime News Network, complained that the mixture of the \\"serious\\" premise and storyline coupled with the gratuitous sexualization was \\"uncomfortable at best; disturbing at worst\\", and attacked the \\"creative bankruptcy, interminable explication, lazy characterization\\" of the series. Ultimately, a score of 1.5 was given. Carlo Santos too gave Freezing a score of 1.5, finding it to feel \\"like the brainchild of that one person you knew in high school [who wrote a] Big Epic Space Adventure that no publisher would be dumb enough to accept because it was too unwieldy and confusing [...] Except that in Japan, someone actually did accept that Big Epic Space Adventure. And made an unwieldy, confusing anime out of it.\\" Freezing: Vibration also received generally positive critical reception. Anime News Network's Theron Martin noted that \\"the content follows through well enough that this is looking like a largely satisfying follow-up to the original\\" for a final score of 3 out of 5. Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post commended the audio and storytelling capability of Vibration, and particular praise was directed at the humanity and relatability of the characters, including Elizabeth's character and Satellizer's backstory, with Beveridge finding the series to not be afraid of \\"screwing with\\" its cast. Vibration was summarized as \\"solid [...] across the board and it‚Äôs definitely a great second act to the story of Freezing\\", with a content grade of A‚àí. Sequential Tart rated Vibration an 8 out of 10, critiquing the \\"deeper and darker\\" direction of the plot (especially Satellizer's past relationship with her brother Louis), new characters, and storyline, finding the enjoyability of the second season to be \\"equally as well as the first, though in different ways. It has great characters and an interesting story.\\"  Notes  References External links *Freezing at Comic Valkyrie ** Freezing: First Chronicle at Comic Valkyrie ** Freezing: Zero at Comic Valkyrie ** Freezing Pair Love Stories at Comic Valkyrie  Freezing at FUNimation * at Seven Seas Entertainment * Category:2007 manga Category:2011 Japanese television series endings Category:2011 manga Category:2012 manga Category:Action anime and manga Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Ecchi anime and manga Category:Funimation Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Haksan Culture Company titles Category:School life in anime and manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Seven Seas Entertainment titles Category:Tokyo MX original programming Category:Tong Li Publishing titles Category:Works set in the future ","title":"Freezing (manga)"},{"id":"24636426","text":"Jim Houlihan Park at Jack Coffey Field, or simply Houlihan Park, is a baseball venue located on the Rose Hill campus of Fordham University in the Bronx, New York, United States.

Cox (August 20, 1921 - April 27, 1990) was an oil equipment executive from Houston who was the 1962 Republican gubernatorial nominee in the U.S. state of Texas. Early years Cox was born in or near Breckenridge, the county seat of Stephens County in West Texas. He graduated from the University of North Texas at Denton. He was a U.S. Naval aviator in the Pacific theater during World War II. From 1947‚Äì1953, he served as a Democrat in the Texas House of Representatives from District 108, which included Stephens County. Opposing Price Daniel, 1960 In 1960, Cox, a \\"Shivercrat\\" ally of former Governor Allan Shivers, challenged the three-term governor, Marion Price Daniel Sr., of Liberty in southeastern Texas. Daniel was a veteran officeholder, having been a U.S. senator from 1953‚Äì1957. His wife and son, Price Daniel Jr., were direct descendants of the legendary Sam Houston, first president of the Republic of Texas. Cox polled 619,834 votes (40.5 percent) in the Democratic primary, as Daniel prevailed with 908,992 votes (59.5 percent).Congressional Quarterly Press's Guide to U.S. Elections, Vol. 2, 6th edition, Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly Press, 2010, p. 1722 After defeating Cox, Daniel overwhelmed the Republican nominee, William M. Steger, a Dallas native who was later a U.S. District Court judge, appointed by U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. The federal courthouse in downtown Tyler is named for Steger.Tyler Morning Telegraph, June 5, 2006 In 1962, Daniel was eliminated in the primary for a fourth two-year term. John Connally, the former U.S. Navy secretary in the John F. Kennedy administration, waged the most active campaign of several Texas Democrats who challenged Daniel. For the primary alone, Connally traveled more than 22,000 miles, delivered forty-three major speeches, and appeared on various statewide and local telecasts. In a closely matched runoff election, Connally defeated Don Yarborough, a liberal attorney from Houston, who carried the backing of organized labor. 1962 governor's race Cox ran for governor again in 1962, this time as a convert to the Republican Party. In the GOP primary, he handily defeated Roy Robert Whittenburg Sr. (1913‚Äì1980), a rancher, banker, and newspaper publisher from Amarillo, who had also been the unsuccessful nominee against U.S. Senator Ralph W. Yarborough (no relation to Don Yarborough) in the 1958 general election. Cox faced John Connally, only a year-and-a-half since John G. Tower, then of Wichita Falls, had become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Texas since Reconstruction. In his memoirs Consequences, John Tower terms Cox: > ... an attractive, spirited campaigner [who faced in Connally] a political > heavyweight, who was quick and deadly when it came to one-on-one slugging. > It occurred to me that should Connally be elected, he would probably serve > four years as governor and then challenge me for the Senate seat in 1966, a > contest I might not survive. ... However, our timetables never coincided. > Connally served three two-year terms as governor and returned to Washington > as treasury secretary in 1971. He ultimately switched parties and ran > unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980. > Despite Connally's effectiveness, Jack Cox refused to roll over and play > dead. His principal campaign strategy was to exploit the LBJ issue, and he > used the slogan 'Lyndon's Boy, John' to describe Connally. Cox kept hitting > Connally for his close ties to Johnson and, by extension, his connection to > the Kennedys. LBJ and \\"Lyndon's boy, John\\" had sold out the South, he > declared at every opportunity.John G. Tower, Consequences: A Personal and > Political Memoir, Canada: Little, Brown Company, 1991, pp. 165-166, > Cox indeed at times seemed to be running more against Vice President Johnson > than Connally. In Tyler, he retorted: \\"Six flags have flown over Texas ... > but we are determined that the seventh flag of LBJ will not fly over the > capitol at Austin.Ashman, p. 22. > [Tower recalls the] Cox campaign as gutsy, but not enough to change the > outcome. And Kennedy's soaring popularity after the Cuban missile crisis > made matters worse. Still, Cox ran strongly enough to give some help to > other Republicans on the ticket. None of our statewide candidates survived, > but six of the Dallas County state legislative seats went Republican. Bruce > Alger retained his place in the U.S. House by twenty thousand votes, and Ed > Foreman scored a major breakthrough by taking the Sixteenth Congressional > District in West Texas. ... Some Democratic liberals refused to support Connally in 1962, and Cox hoped to exploit that weakness, as Tower had done in his 1961 special election runoff against appointed Senator William Blakley of Dallas.Tower, Consequences, p. 21 The Connally-Cox race was surprisingly close even though the political establishment and most of the state's newspapers supported Connally, who prevailed, 847,036 (54 percent) to 715,025 (45.6 percent). A Constitution Party candidate (not the current national Constitution Party), Jack Carswell (died 1996), polled 7,135 votes (.4 of 1 percent). Cox carried 55 of the 254 counties, including two of the most populous, his own Harris County and Dallas County. O.W. \\"Bill\\" Hayes of Temple, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor against Democrat Preston Smith, a state senator and theater owner from Lubbock who had been reared in Lamesa in Dawson County, trailed Cox's losing total by more than 100,000 ballots, having received 612,568 votes and victory in 16 counties. Hayes was a motivational author best known for his 1959 publication Your Memory: How to Use Untapped Memory Resources. Ironically, Connally derided Cox for having switched parties, something Connally himself did eleven years later after the death of Lyndon Johnson and at the height of Watergate, when he lent his support to President Nixon.Ashman, p. 5. Connally admitted that Texas Republicans in 1962 were better organized at the precinct level than the majority Democrats: \\"The Republicans worked hard, while the Democrats did not get busy until the final weeks.\\"Ashman, p. 23. Despite Cox's relatively impressive showing for a Republican candidate in an historically Democratic state, he received only 95,191 more votes in the 1962 general election than he had in the 1960 Democratic primary. U.S. Senate primary, 1964 In 1964, Cox ran for the U.S. Senate. His main primary opponent was oilman George Herbert Walker Bush, a Massachusetts native then residing in Houston and the son of former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut. The Texas Senate seat was held by Democrat Ralph Yarborough. Also in the running was Robert J. Morris, a New Jersey native, a staunchly anti-communist crusader, and a former president of the University of Dallas. Barbara Pierce Bush, in her memoir, said that she found primary campaigns distasteful because the candidates undermine each other and provide fodder for the opposition in the general election. She then accused Cox of engaging in \\"harangue\\" at one pre-election appearance. Barbara Bush claimed that the John Birch Society was behind much of the opposition to her husband for the senatorial nomination. The opponents, she claimed, unfairly discounted his conservative political principles. Most JBS members supported either Cox or Morris and considered Bush a \\"tool of the eastern establishment\\" kingmakers, who had practically chosen all Republican presidential nominees since the 1930s. Cox and Morris emphasized their support for the insurgent presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, whom Bush also later endorsed. However, the JBS claimed that Bush was really sympathetic to Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, of New York, Goldwater's principal challenger for the nomination and the epitome of eastern elitism. Some Republican partisans chided Bush as insufficiently Texan in demeanor and manner. Bush advisors suggested that their candidate wear a cowboy hat to fit more firmly into the state's western culture, but Bush rejected the notion as a \\"gimmick.\\" Barbara Bush in her memoir characterizes her husband as a \\"fiscal conservative and a social liberal,\\" noting that her eastern friends called him \\"too conservative\\" and some Texas Republicans found him \\"too liberal.\\" In the first primary, Bush led with 62,985 votes (44.1 percent) to Cox's 45,561 (31.9 percent) and Morris' 28,279 (19.8 percent). A fourth candidate, thoracic surgeon Milton Davis, polled the remaining 4.2 percent of the ballots. In the lower-turnout runoff to guarantee a majority nominee, Bush handily prevailed, 49,751 (62.1 percent) to Cox's 30,333 (37.9 percent). Cox then endorsed Bush and never again sought office. Bush was also the choiced of the then influential state party chairman Peter O'Donnell of Dallas. Though he waged an energetic campaign, Bush still lost the 1964 general election to Yarborough, as Cox's particular political nemesis, Lyndon Johnson, swept to victory over Barry Goldwater for a full term in office, by wide margins both nationally and in Texas.Congressional Quarterly Press's Guide to U.S. Elections, Vol. 2, 6th edition, Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly Press, 2010, p. 1541 Exile to Costa Rica From 1966-1972, Cox had apparently left the oil equipment business, for he was then the manager of the Forty Acres Club, a hotel-restaurant and political gathering spot in the capital city of Austin. In September 1972, the club was sold for $800,000 to the University of Texas at Austin. Cox was saddled with civil court judgments in excess of $120,000, one of which was a $55,000 debt owed to Mike Butler, a brick manufacturer in Austin. The money had been borrowed to purchase stock in the Forty Acres Club. Other large judgments against Cox were $47,000 owed to the Capital National Bank in Austin and $258,500 to the Dallas Bank and Trust Company. Cox thereafter left Austin for San Jose, Costa Rica. Twice a year he journeyed to the Panama Canal Zone to renew his residency papers. Also in San Jose at the time was the fugitive financier Robert Vesco. Cox was reportedly still living in San Jose in the fall of 1976. The author has been unable to determine Cox's presence from 1977 until his death in 1990 at the age of sixty-eight. Nor can he find information on Cox's family, branch of military service, church affiliation, place and cause of death, or interment site. Cox's political papers from 1950-1964 are housed at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas, which presumably if search would answer those questions.

It is a English Tudor Revival mansion designed by architect Clarence Aldrich. It has been used as a filming location for films and television series, including Donnie Darko, Not Another Teen Movie, Weird Science, and Beverly Hills, 90210. History The house was built in 1927 by William E. \\"Billy\\" Babb, who made a fortune when oil was discovered on nearby Signal Hill. In 1929, the house was purchased by Russell Honore Pray (1892-1971) for his wife, Leonie Pray. Russell Pray was a lawyer who graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1913. He served in France during World War I and held the rank of captain at the time of his discharge. Following discharge, he remained in Paris, first attending Sorbonne University, then practicing law. While living in France, he met his wife, Leonie Pray. The couple married in Paris after \\"a whirlwind courtship\\" and then moved to Long Beach. She attended a school in Pasadena to rid herself of her French accent, and as a graduation present, Russell Pray purchased the English Tudor house for her. Beginning in 1932 and continuing through the 1970s, the Prays decorated the house with flowers and a two-story Christmas tree and held an annual New Year's Eve party at the house. Following the 1973 open house, the Long Beach Press-Telegram wrote: \\"Everyone is still talking about Leonie Pray's elegant New Year's Eve party, so I will too. Her lovely Los Cerritos home bloomed with pink azaelas but the guests were most impressed by the 14-foot Christmas tree. By a trick of light selection when the 300 tree lights are on, the observer gets an image of four magnificent trees.\\" In 1976, a Long Beach newspaper described the holiday tradition: \\"Champagne sparkled at the Los Cerritos home of Leonie Pray just as it has each New Year's Eve for half a century. Except for the World War II years, Leonie and her late husband, Russell, invited friends and neighbors to open house.\\" The house was a center of social life for the upper class of Long Beach for many years. Leonie became an actress in community theater while her husband practiced law. A Long Beach newspaper later wrote that \\"it was in the Pray home that Leonie starred as a hostess.\\" Liberace, then a young concert pianist, made one of his first appearances in the Prays' living room. Opera star Ris√´ Stevens also sang for a select group at the home. In 1966, the Prays were still living in the house when the Long Beach Independent ran a story on the house. The paper wrote: \\"When things get dull on the fishing and hunting fronts, one can always turn to the North Forties, out in Los Cerritos Heights, for wildlife notes. That applies especially to the Russell and Leonie Pray home, 4252 Country Club Drive, where there is never any end to wildlife. Perhaps it is because both Russell and Leonie love birds and animals of all kinds.\\" In 1968, a Molotov cocktail firebomb ignited a blaze at the home. At the time, Russell Pray, then 76 years old and the senior partner in the law firm of Pray, Price, Williams and Deatherage, told officers he heard an explosion in the alley behind his home and ran outside to see flames shooting up. He called the police and the fire department, but was able to extinguish the fire with a garden hose. Damage was confined to the rear gate which was scorched and blackened. Russell Pray died in 1971, and Leonie Pray continued to live at the house. The house was subsequently acquired by William F. Dawson and is sometimes referred to as the Dawson-Pray House. Architecture and historic designation The English Tudor Revival structure was designed by Long Beach architect Clarence Aldrich. It combines red brick with artificial dark wood timbers and stucco, a gothic arched entry, a cathedral ceiling with wood trusses in the living room, leaded glass casement windows and gabled dormers. The house also has a huge two story living room paneled entirely in hand carved wood, was a natural setting for \\"salons.\\" It has been designated as a Long Beach Historic Landmark. A web site dedicated to the Long Beach Historic Landmarks notes that \\"this English Tudor mansion is one of the most architecturally significant residential structures in Long Beach. Its scale, size, and detail is unmatched in the city.\\" Shooting location in films and television The house and neighborhood have been used in several feature films. The neighborhood has become known as the \\"American Pie\\" neighborhood, because the American Pie feature was shot there. The house that was the home of Ferris Bueller in Ferris Bueller's Day Off is on the same block at 4160 Country Club Drive. The Pray House has been used in the following films: * In 1983, the house was used in the American thriller film The Star Chamber, where this home was featured as the secret and exclusive location where the Star Chamber met, a group of judges who identify criminals who fell through the judicial system's cracks and then take actions against them outside the legal structure. The last scene revealing where the Star Chamber had been meeting secretly was filmed here. * In 1985, the house was used in the film Weird Science. * In 2001, the house was used as the home of Jim Cunningham (played by Patrick Swayze) in Donnie Darko. The title character (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) sets fire to the house, and police find evidence in the wreckage that Cunningham is involved in child pornography. * Also in 2001, the house was the home of leading man Jake \\"the Jock\\" (played by Chris Evans) in Not Another Teen Movie. * In the television series Beverly Hills, 90210, the house was the home of Ty Collins. It is featured in the episode \\"Help Me, Rhonda\\" in which Adrianna meets with Ty's parents.

The building was mostly built of cut stone, with a carved wooden porch, a domed roof, and a square minaret, and was surrounded by a stone wall and gated iron fence.

He was the eldest son of the colony's founder, William Penn (1644‚Äì1718), by his second wife, Hannah Callowhill Penn (1671‚Äì1726). Since he was the only one of Penn's children to be born in the New World, the Americas (in the Slate Roof House in Philadelphia), he was called \\"the American\\" by his family.  Life  Penn was raised by a cousin in Bristol, England, where he learned the trade of merchant, specializing in linen. As a result of his father's will and by his mother's appointment, he received half of the proprietorship of Pennsylvania. On May 12, 1732, John‚Äîwith his brothers Thomas Penn and Richard Penn, as the proprietors of Pennsylvania‚Äîsigned an order to create a commission. This order was directed to Governor Gordon, Isaac Norris, Samuel Preston, James Logan, and Andrew Hamilton, Esquires, and to the gentlemen James Steel and Robert Charles. The commission, which was to be made up of at least three or more of these individuals, was given full power on behalf of the proprietors for the \\"running, marking, and laying out\\" of any boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland. This was in accordance with the signed agreement between the Penn brothers and Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore on May 10, 1732. He returned to Pennsylvania in September 1734 and attended the meetings of the Pennsylvania Provincial Council, but went back to England in 1735, to support the colony's rights in the boundary dispute with Maryland. The ultimate resolution of this dispute was the surveying of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line.

In mid-1943, Shomrony escaped Zagreb, shortly before the city's remaining Jews were taken to Auschwitz. The route took Shomrony, his wife, daughter, and father from Zagreb to Budapest, through Romania and Bulgaria to Istanbul, and in 1944 they arrived in Palestine. Shomrony twice nominated the war-time archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac to be listed among the Righteous Among the Nations: in 1970 and in 1994. He returned to Croatia in 1996 to participate in a conference on Stepinac. As part of the visit he appeared in the documentary film Svjedok istine. Shomrony died in Israel in 2009.

The system is designed for efficient, outdoor installation and includes remote monitoring and troubleshooting to keep operations and maintenance costs low.Tesla Motors and Solaredge Technologies to unveil powerwall at uk show, Jason Graul, Business Finance News, October 8, 2015  Technology   Background  Traditional PV systems are typically characterized by a centralized inverter or string inverter architecture*. In this topology the inverter performs MPPT for large quantities of solar panels as a whole. Since the solar panels are connected in series to form strings, the same current must flow through all the modules, so the solar inverter continuously adjusts the electric current in the system to find the average optimal working point of all the modules. As a result, potential power may be lost whenever a mismatch exists between modules.[2][3]* Panel mismatch is unavoidable in many cases, due to panel manufacturing tolerance, partial shading,[4] uneven soiling, or uneven tilt angle. In addition, power may also be lost due to slow tracking of dynamic weather conditions caused by moving clouds,[5] and on extremely hot or cold days when the system DC voltage may exceed the inverter's permissible input voltage range*. These factors cause small losses in yearly yields, but they are present. Other drawbacks of traditional PV systems include: * System design is constrained by the need to match all strings‚Äô length and orientation * Monitoring visibility and fault detection are limited to the inverter (or in some cases, to the string level) * High DC voltage is present as long as the sun is up, posing a possible risk of electrocution to installers, maintenance personnel and firefighters* These drawbacks, however, can be mitigated by newer string inverters with advanced electronics and features such as dual, shade-tolerant and improved MPPT.  Offering  SolarEdge delivers a distributed system that tackles the aforementioned challenges. Energy loss due to panel mismatch is prevented by performing MPPT for each panel individually. String voltage is kept fixed at all times, so strings can be combined regardless of length, tilt, or type of panels used. Continuous performance measurement enables online monitoring and fault detection at panel-level. Installer and firefighter safety is enhanced by shutting off the DC voltage whenever the inverter is disconnected. To achieve the above without raising the cost of the system, compared to standard inverters, SolarEdge provides panel optimizers as well as its own inverter and monitoring web portal. The solution is applicable for a wide range of applications, from residential roofs to large scale solar farms.  Products  SolarEdge power optimizers Wiring Example with a safety monitoring interface mode (SMI) and a standard inverter. SolarEdge power optimizer 350W. The long wires are used to connect the SolarEdge power optimizers with each other (in series). On the short wires the photovoltaic module is connected. Power Optimizer The SolarEdge Power Optimizer is embedded into each panel by panel manufacturers instead of the junction box, or retrofitted by PV installers onto regular modules. The power optimizer optimizes energy output by performing Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) individually for each panel and maintains a fixed DC string voltage. Power optimizers also collect performance measurements and telemetries of each panel, and transmit the data over existing power lines. Inverter The SolarEdge Solar inverter is responsible for DC to AC inversion while MPPT and voltage management are handled by power optimizers separately for each module. Fixed string voltage ensures operation at the highest efficiency at all times (97% maximum efficiency), independent of string length and temperature. The company offers single-phase inverters with a rated AC power output of between 3,000 and 11,000 watts, as well as three- phase inverters with a rated AC power output ranging between 7,000 and 25,000 watts. Monitoring Portal Web-based and smartphone (both iOS and Android) applications provide module-level, string-level and system-wide PV Monitoring. The software provides alerts on a wide range of issues affecting energy generation that might otherwise go undetected. Data and alerts are presented on a virtual site map and can be pinpointed to specific location to reduce maintenance time and costs. Tesla has stopped supporting web-based applications and has never supported module-level monitoring in any application for residential customers. Installer Tools SolarEdge provides a set of freeware software tools with its products. The Site Designer recommends string layout and inverter and power optimizer selection, according to the site's size. The Configuration Tool allows remote configuration of the SolarEdge inverter as well as real-time, on-site verification of correct installation, and the iPhone Site Mapping Tool application, allows for swift and easy creations of a virtual map of the PV site.

The corruption case against then Louisiana Representative William J. Jefferson in the United States started on a suspicion of bribery. The FBI raided his Congressional offices in May 2006. He was re-elected to his seat in the fall. On June 4, 2007, a federal grand jury indicted Jefferson on sixteen charges related to corruption. Jefferson was defeated by Republican Joseph Cao on December 6, 2008, and was the most senior Democratic incumbent to lose re- election that year.See NNDB.com, Jefferson article in NNDB Beta, which includes a list of his family members. See also New York Times articles on Jefferson. In 2009 he was tried in the US District Court in Virginia on corruption charges.\\"Trial of former U.S. Rep. William Jefferson begins today in Virginia\\", in Times-Picayune, 9 June 2009 On August 5, 2009, he was found guilty of 11 of the 16 corruption counts.\\"William Jefferson verdict: Guilty on 11 of 16 counts\\" in Times-Picayune, August 5, 2009 Jefferson was sentenced to 13 years on November 13, 2009, the longest sentence ever given to a representative for bribery or any charge.NPR.org After a related bribery case was heard by the United States Supreme Court (McDonnell v. United States (2016), Jefferson's lawyers appealed his case. In view of the findings by the Supreme Court, District Judge T.S. Ellis III dropped seven of the ten charges on which Jefferson had been convicted and ordered his release from prison on October 5, 2017. On December 1, 2017, a federal judge reduced his sentence to time served: five years and five months, based on a joint recommendation by the prosecutors and defense attorneys.AP, \\"No more prison time for William Jefferson, judge rules\\", Times-Picayune, 1 December 2017 Corruption investigation The investigation began in mid-2005, after an investor alleged $400,000 in bribes were paid through a company maintained in the name of Jefferson's spouse and children. The money was traced to a tech company named iGate, Inc., of Louisville, Kentucky. In return for the payment, it is alleged, Jefferson would help iGate's business. Jefferson was to persuade the U.S. Army to test iGate's broadband two-way technology and other iGate products; use his efforts to influence high-ranking officials in Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon; and meet with personnel of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, in order to facilitate potential financing for iGate business deals in those countries. On 30 July 2005, Jefferson was videotaped by the FBI receiving $100,000 worth of $100 bills in a leather briefcase at the Ritz- Carlton hotel in Arlington, Virginia.Jefferson told an investor, Lori Mody, who was wearing a wire, that he would need to give Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar $500,000 \\"as a motivating factor\\" to make sure they obtained contracts for iGate and Mody's company in Nigeria. A few days later, on 3 August 2005, FBI agents raided Jefferson's home in Northeast Washington and, as noted in an 83-page affidavit filed to support a subsequent raid on his Congressional office, \\"found $90,000 of the cash in the freezer, in $10,000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen-food containers\\". Serial numbers found on the currency in the freezer matched serial numbers of funds given by the FBI to their informant. Late on the night of May 20, 2006, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Jefferson's office in the Rayburn House Office Building.Affidavit and search warrant (1.25MB PDF) After the raid, one of Democrat Jefferson's staunchest defenders in the turf battles between the FBI and Congress became Dennis Hastert, who was the Republican Speaker of the House. The affidavit used to support these raids alleged: *The FBI videotaped Jefferson receiving a stock certificate from Mody for a company set up in Nigeria to promote iGate's technology. Jefferson predicted the deal would generate $200 million annually after five years. *Jefferson told Mody that he wanted a similar financial stake in the business in Ghana. *Jefferson sought $10 million in financing from Mody to take over iGate and install \\"confidants\\" on the new board. In two payments, Mody wired $89,225 to the ANJ Group LLC, a company controlled by Jefferson's family. *Jefferson lent $4,800 of the money Mody gave him to an unnamed congressional aide. Another $4,900 was given back to the FBI by one of Jefferson's attorneys. *The FBI claims it has uncovered \\"at least seven other schemes in which Jefferson sought things of value in return for his official acts\\". In 2009 Amy Berman Jackson represented Jefferson, the nine-term Louisiana representative, in his corruption trial. Former aides' guilty pleas In January 2006, Brett M. Pfeffer, a former aide to Jefferson, implicated him in a corruption scheme involving an Internet company being set up in Nigeria. Pfeffer was president of an investment company in McLean, Virginia. In return for political support for the deal, Jefferson had legal work directed toward the Jefferson family's operations. It was also said that a daughter of Jefferson was put on retainer of the Virginia investment company to the tune of $5,000 a month. Jefferson is said to have arranged for his family to have a 5-percent to 7-percent ownership stake in the Nigerian internet company. On January 11, 2006, in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Pfeffer pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and aiding and abetting bribery of a public official.Ana Radelat, Gannett News Service, \\"Former congressional aide pleads guilty to bribery\\", USA Today, 11 January 2006.

On May 3, 2006, during a plea hearing in U.S. District Court, Vernon Jackson, 53, CEO of Louisville, Kentucky-based iGate Inc., pleaded guilty to bribery of a public official and conspiracy to bribe a public official. According to the Associated Press, \\"court documents make clear that Congressman William Jefferson (Democrat- Louisiana) is the accused congressman, without naming him\\". Jackson's plea bargain requires his cooperation in the ongoing investigation against the congressman he admits bribing. The total amount of the bribes is between $400,000 and $1 million, according to court documents of the Jackson proceeding.FBI, \\"Businessman Pleads Guilty to Paying Bribes to U.S. Congressman\\", FBI, May 3, 2006.

Congressional office raid  The raid of Jefferson's office set off a series of political events: Jefferson immediately challenged the action in federal court. House Speaker Dennis Hastert and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued \\"a rare joint statement demanding that the FBI return the documents and saying that Jefferson then should cooperate more fully with the investigation\\".\\"Bush orders documents seized in Capitol Hill search sealed\\", CNN \\"Many Republicans and Democrats contend that the unprecedented raid on a congressional office was unduly aggressive and may have breached the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government that are meant to shelter lawmakers from administrative intimidation.\\"Shailagh Murray and Allan Lengel, Washington Post, May 25, 2006 Tensions escalated to the point where ‚Äì according to AP ‚Äì Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, his deputy Paul McNulty, and possibly FBI Director Robert Mueller \\"were said to be ready to quit if the Justice Department was asked to return the Jefferson documents ... [while the] House was threatening to go after the Justice Department's budget\\". On May 25, President Bush stepped in, taking the extraordinary step of \\"directing the Department of Justice to seal all the materials recovered from Congressman Jefferson's office for the next 45 days and not to allow access to anyone involved in the investigation\\". Representative James Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, began to hold hearings ‚Äì called \\"Reckless Justice: Did the Saturday Night Raid of Congress Trample the Constitution?\\" ‚Äì on the \\"profoundly disturbing\\" questions that Sensenbrenner said were raised by the Justice Department's actions. The FBI, in answering Jefferson's complaint of the raid, attached an FBI agent's affidavit claiming that the raid was necessary because, while the FBI was searching Jefferson's home in August, Jefferson tried to \\"surreptitiously remove\\" documents. An ABC News poll released 1 June 2006 found 86% of Americans supported the FBI's right to search congressional offices when they obtain a warrant. On July 10, 2006, Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, ruled that the FBI raid on Jefferson's office was legal,Judge rules FBI raid on Hill office legal ‚Äî Jerry Seper and Christina Bellantoni, Washington Times, July 11, 2006 rejecting the claim of both Jefferson and the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives that the search violated the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, separation of powers principle, and the Fourth Amendment. Chief Judge Hogan, in a 28-page ruling, acknowledged that the \\"facts and questions of law presented here are indeed unprecedented\\", but wrote that it is \\"well-established\\" that a Congressman is \\"generally bound to the operation of the criminal laws as are ordinary persons\\", and that the Speech or Debate Clause does not \\"make Members of Congress super-citizens, immune from criminal responsibility.'\\", citing United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 516. Hogan, in his conclusion, wrote: > The existing broad protections of the Speech or Debate Clause ‚Äì absolute > immunity from prosecution or suit for legislative acts and freedom from > being 'questioned' about those acts (including privilege from the > testimonial act of producing documents in response to a subpoena) ‚Äì satisfy > the fundamental purpose of the Clause to protect the independence of the > legislature.

Congressman Jefferson's > interpretation of the Speech or Debate privilege would have the effect of > converting every congressional office into a taxpayer-subsidized sanctuary > for crime. Such a result is not supported by the Constitution or judicial > precedent and will not be adopted here. See Williamson v. United States, 28 > S. Ct. at 167 ('[T]he laws of this country allow no place or employment as a > sanctuary for crime.') (quotation omitted). Later in that same month, however, a three-judge appellate panel unanimously overruled Hogan's decision and affirmed that the Department of Justice could not review Jefferson's files until Jefferson had seen what files were taken and which of those pertained to his work as a legislator. The appellate court directed that Hogan, the judge who originally authorized the controversial search and seizure, should ascertain whether Jefferson's claims of legislative privilege extended to specific seized files that the lawmaker might cite. On March 31, 2008, the United States Supreme Court denied further review. Removal of committee membership On May 24, 2006, after months of refusing to deal with the Jefferson scandal amid rising public outrage, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi publicly requested Jefferson's immediate resignation from the House Ways and Means Committee, but he declined to step down. Although Mel Watt, then chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, declared the strong support of the caucus for Jefferson, it has since been reported that two prominent members of the caucus ‚Äì John Lewis (D-GA) and Charles B. Rangel (D-NY) ‚Äì played major roles in the campaign to force Jefferson to step down. On June 15, 2006, House Democrats voted to strip Jefferson of his committee assignment while the federal bribery investigation continued. The intra-party vote passed 99 to 58. Some have reported that the vote was passed as a result of Democrats who were determined to make an election-year point about ethics. The full House, the only group with the power to remove Jefferson, stripped him of his seat on the committee on June 16 in a voice vote without debate. Jefferson had offered to step aside temporarily if the Democratic caucus established a rule concerning cases like his and if his seat went to Rep. Charlie Melancon (D-LA). This offer was rejected by House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi.\\"House lawmakers strip Jefferson of panel seat\\", NBC News, June 16, 2006. Retrieved December 9, 2006. Indictment, trial, conviction, and sentencing Photo of cash found in Jefferson's freezer in the August 2005 raid was shown to jurors on 8 July 2009 On June 4, 2007 Jefferson was indicted on 16 charges of corruption by a federal grand jury. On June 8, 2007, Jefferson pleaded not guilty to the charges. After the hearing, Jefferson said, \\"I am absolutely innocent of the charges that have been leveled against me. I'm going to fight my heart out to clear my name.\\" He further explained: \\"The $90,000 was the FBI's money. The FBI gave it to me as part of its plan ‚Äî part of their plan ‚Äî that I would give it to the Nigerian vice president, but I did not do that. When all the facts are understood, I trust that I will be vindicated.\\" The FBI has denied working with Jefferson. Jefferson appealed the indictment, on 14 of the 16 counts, by claiming \\"legislative immunity provided by the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution\\"; in November 2008, however, Judge Robert King rejected the appeal and upheld the indictment on all 16 counts. Jefferson's 4th Circuit Court of Appeals trial had originally been set to begin on December 2, 2008, but was postponed until January 15, 2009, (after the December 6, 2008, general election in Louisiana's 2nd congressional district). Jefferson's attorneys sought \\"issuance of a mandate\\" in petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to oblige postponement of Jefferson's trial by lower courts. Quoted by Bruce Alpert of the Times-Picayune Washington Bureau, Jefferson's lawyers based their petition for postponement in part on an argument that \\"Once a trial takes place, the injury caused by exposure to trial cannot be undone, even if he [Jefferson] is acquitted or a conviction is subsequently reversed\\" (the \\"injury\\" being in the context of Jefferson's December 6, 2008, election loss to Anh \\"Joseph\\" Cao).

Lytle objected, citing the repeated earlier delays in the trial date. Ellis denied a number of other requests by Trout. Ellis also cautioned that he would offer no further delays beyond 2 June 2009. Concurrently, according to Stephanie Grace, in a Times-Picayune column on March 19, 2009, Jefferson's supporters have been attempting to rehabilitate Jefferson by sending thousands of e-mails attacking Cao, U.S. Senator David Vitter, radio commentator Rush Limbaugh, and other Republicans but that still ::Jefferson's quest for acquittal is the challenge of a lifetime. And no matter how many e-mails his remaining \\"friends\\" send out, vindication in the eyes of the voters will be even tougher.Stephanie Grace, Rehab a tall order for Jefferson, Times-Picayune, March 19, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, p. B7 (accessed March 19, 2009). On April 12, 2009, Times- Picayune columnist James Gill cited the emergence of a group styling itself \\"Friends of Congressman William J. Jefferson\\" and opined that the group should change its name to \\"Friends of ex-Congressman William J. Jefferson\\"; Gill, reporting Jefferson's argument that 14 of the 16 felony counts against him should be thrown out as not statutorily definable as bribery, concluded that ::Beating 14 counts would be a great coup for any defendant, but the joy must be somewhat diminished for one who is facing 16.James Gill, \\"Jefferson's friends an optimistic bunch\\", Times-Picayune, April 12, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, p. B5. Gill had taken note that on May 14, 2009 the \\"Friends\\" planned to stage a \\"Celebration of Service\\" for Jefferson, with Jefferson's trial to begin 2 weeks later.The \\"Friends\\" claimed to be energized by the acquittal of Alaska's former Republican Senator Ted Stevens. \\"Spirited Appreciation Celebration with Acknowledgment, Music, Dance and Fellowship\\" was the \\"Friends\\" official description of the \\"Celebration of Service\\" program, which went on as scheduled.Stephanie Grace, Jefferson had it all in Times-Picayune, May 17, 2009, Metro Edition, p. B5. Within days after the \\"Celebration of Service\\", Gill published an allegation that long-time associates of Jefferson had orchestrated the New Orleans e-mail controversy as a means to embarrass and weaken Democrat Stacy Head, who had in 2006 defeated Jefferson prot√©g√©e Ren√©e Gill Pratt (the sexual partner of William's brother Mose Jefferson) and in 2008 had endorsed Republican Joseph Cao's successful attempt to unseat Jefferson.James Gill, \\"Is Jefferson a factor in City Hall feud?\\", in Times- Picayune, May 22, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, p. B7. Washington was the lawyer who under questionable circumstances published Head's e-mails. On May 27, after a contentious hearing with defense attorney Robert Trout and prosecutor Mark Lytle, Judge T. S. Ellis III delayed the trial opening until June 9.Bruce Alpert, \\"Jefferson trial put off until June 9\\" in Times-Picayune, May 28, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A10. About the same time, developments surrounding Gill Pratt's decision to go on an unpaid leave of absence from her administrative job at Southern University at New Orleans prompted columnist Stephanie Grace to surmise that Jefferson was losing his clout at the New Orleans institution, where his wife Andrea Green Jefferson is also an administrator.Stephanie Grace, \\"Jefferson grip on SUNO isn't what it once was\\" in Times-Picayune, June 2, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, p. B5. On June 7, two days before the trial opening, the Times-Picayune published a lengthy analysis of the allegations and supposed participants.Bruce Alpert, [www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-13/1244352680178040.xml&coll;=1 \\"Jefferson case reaches courtroom: Corruption trial full of firsts‚ÄîFireworks set to unfold Tuesday\\"] in Times-Picayune, June 07, 2009, Metro Edition, pp. A1, A14-A15. In the weeks before the trial, Jefferson's lawyers, as described by the Times-Picayune, had concentrated on jury selection.Bruce Alpert & Jonathan Tilove, \\"Jefferson's attorneys want to pick jurors' brains\\" by Bruce Alpert & Jonathan Tilove, Times-Picayune (New Orleans), April 19, 2009, p. A17 The challenge before them was not reduced by a couple of events in the two weeks before the trial date. First, Angela Coleman (the former congressman's niece through his wife), told a federal court that she could not afford to continue hiring lawyer John Fuller; the court-assigned public defender Virginia Schlueter to the case, which concerns Coleman's alleged involvement in misappropriation (of more than $600,000 in state and federal grant funding) by Betty Jefferson, Mose Jefferson, and Ren√©e Gill Pratt.\\"Jefferson's niece gets a new lawyer\\", in Times-Picayune, May 24, 2009, Metro Edition, p. B2. The online version, \\"Former congressman's niece needs new lawyer\\", adds a statement that Brenda Jefferson (another relative) previously answered 'guilty' to assisting in concealment of that fraud. Second, a transcript of tapes of a 2005 dinner conversation between William J. Jefferson and Lori Mody, Virginia businesswoman and prosecution witness, obtained by the Times- Picayune, was so clear as to include observations of their dessert preferences and noted \\"stomach grumbling\\" sounds.Bruce Alpert & Jonathan Tilove, \\"Jurors will be all ears\\", in Times-Picayune, May 24, 2009, Metro Edition, p. A7. For various reasons the prosecution decided not to call Mody to testify in person but to rely on the taped conversationsStephanie Grace, \\"Jefferson accuser will be heard, not seen\\", in Times-Picayune, 14 June 2009, Metro Edition, p. B5.‚Äîa decision perceived by many as weakening the prosecution's case.Bruce Alpert, \\"Jefferson case may not be airtight: Experts see weak spots in feds' arguments\\", in Times-Picayune, June 15, 2009, Metro Edition, pp. A1, A3. Stephanie Grace, \\"Absence raises questions\\" in Times-Picayune, July 05, 2009, Metro Edition, p. B5. On June 9, 2009, prosecutors in William Jefferson's corruption trial released a 152-page list of trial exhibits, including a list of Jefferson's daughters and the elite colleges they attended, asserting that his daughters and their colleges were the beneficiaries of bribes paid to ANJ Group in exchange for Jefferson's assistance in securing contracts for American companies in western Africa.\\"Exhibits in Jefferson trial reveal payments to daughters' colleges\\", in Times-Picayune, June 10, 2009 Jury selection began the same day. Extent and accuracy of prior knowledge of the case were major concerns in selection of jurors. By June 14, 2009, twelve jurors (eight women, four men) had been selected from a pool of more than a hundred potential jurors.Bruce Alpert & Jonathan Tilove, \\"Cold cash common knowledge\\" in Times-Picayune, June 14, 2009, Metro Edition, p. A8. On June 24, 2009, iGate CEO Vernon Jackson, testifying in the court, alleged that in 2002 he felt coerced into continuing to be involved in the Nigerian deal with William J. Jefferson; an attempt by then-chancellor Joseph Bouie to remove Jefferson's wife, Andrea Jefferson, as vice chancellor for academic affairs at SUNO for reasons involving nepotism, instead resulted in the removal of Bouie.Bruce Alpert & Jonathan Tilove, \\"iGate exec says he feared retribution\\", in Times-Picayune, June 24, 2009, Metro Edition, pp. A1, A6. According to the article, members of the Board of Supervisors of the Southern University System nonetheless attributed Bouie's removal to sexual harassment and poor financial oversight. On July 7, 2009, a federal jury was shown a video of Jefferson accepting a suitcase filled with $100,000 in cash outside a Northern Virginia hotel. In the video, it was reported that Jefferson seemed wary of accepting the money in public. The FBI recorded the exchange from four different angles, and all were shown to the jury.Google.com On August 5, 2009, Jefferson was convicted on 11 of the 16 corruption charges against him. On August 6, 2009, Jefferson went back to court for forfeiture proceedings. His defense argued that much of the money the government wished to seize was from legitimate business enterprise and his \\"passion for Africa\\". Jefferson and family were held liable to forfeit more than $470,000 of this bribe money paid to sham companies under the family's control. The jury also found ANJ Group could be required to surrender millions of shares of stock in a Kentucky technology company and a Nigerian telecommunications venture. The $470,000 included $21,353 which the former congressman's brother, Mose, received in bribe payments and which was ultimately used to help pay off Andrea Jefferson's credit-card debt, and helped pay for Jelani Jefferson's Harvard Law School tuition.\\"William Jefferson should forfeit $470,000 after guilty verdict, jury says\\", in Times-Picayune. On August 30, 2009, the Times-Picayune reported that William J. Jefferson and his attorneys had requested that he be retried.Bruce Alpert & Jonathan Tilove, \\"William Jefferson seeks new trial\\", in Times- Picayune, August 30, 2009, Metro Edition, p. A6. In August 2009, after his conviction, William J. Jefferson and his wife, Andrea Jefferson applied for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The Times-Picayune estimated that the claimed debts totaled between $1 million and $10 million.Frank Donze, \\"William Jefferson files for Chapter 7\\", in Times-Picayune, September 1, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A4. On September 21, 2009, Federal Judge T.S. Ellis III denied Jefferson's request for a new trial. In October 2009, the Louisiana Supreme Court placed Jefferson on interim suspension from the practice of law. On November 13, 2009, Jefferson was sentenced to 13 years for bribery, the longest sentence ever handed down to a congressman for bribery or any other charge. On March 26, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the conviction on ten of the eleven charges, reversing one conviction involving a phone call because the case for that charge was tried in the wrong part of the United States. On November 26, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Jefferson's petition for certiorari, making the convictions final. He is scheduled for release on August 30, 2023.William J. Jefferson, inmate #72121-083, Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Dep't of Justice, at . On May 1, 2015, the Louisiana Supreme Court permanently disbarred Jefferson based on his behavior \\"us[ing] his congressional office for fraudulent and illegal activities by soliciting bribes in exchange for official acts.\\" This behavior closely matched Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, Appendix E, Guideline 7, which suggests that permanent disbarment may be appropriate when there is \\"[m]alfeasance in office which results in a felony conviction, and which involves fraud.\\" In Re: William J. Jefferson, No. 2015-B-0508 (La. 2015) (per curiam). Reduction in charges and re-sentencing In 2016, the United States Supreme Court heard McDonnell v. United States, a bribery case involving former governor of Virginia, McDonnell. It ruled that inadequate instruction was given to the jury and about the definition of certain elements of the law. Charges were dropped against McDonnell and he was released from prison. In light of these findings, Jefferson's attorneys filed an appeal. US District Judge T.S. Ellis III reviewed Jefferson's case, dropping seven of the most substantial of the ten charges and ordering on October 5, 2017 that he be released from prison, until the government decides on sentencing or other actions. On December 1, 2017, a federal judge reduced Jefferson's sentence to time served: five years and five months, based on a joint recommendation by the prosecutors and defense attorneys.AP, \\"No more prison time for William Jefferson, judge rules\\", NOLA, 1 December 2017 References Category:Congressional scandals Category:Political corruption scandals in the United States ","title":"William J.

Aboriginal people from the region were gradually drawn or relocated from their traditional lands into the mission settlement. The Gungganydji people were the main group to be settled there. In the 1960s, the Anglican Church relinquished control of the mission. The Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, a government department, under the Act continued running the affairs of the community. On 29 October 1987, under the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984, a Deed of Grant in Trust was given to the Yarrabah community over the Cape Grafton area. Like other DOGIT communities of the time, Yarrabah had a Community Council elected by Aboriginal people living in the community. Responsibilities As the Shire is not operated under the Local Government Act and operates the land on behalf of the community, the Shire Council's responsibilities are quite different from a typical local government body. This includes responsibility for fisheries, alcohol management and employment initiatives. The Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council operates an Indigenous Knowledge Centre at Noble Drive in Yarrabah.

Little and James Brown, Boston, Massachusetts, 1847.Monk, Linda R. The Words We Live By, p 158, Hyperion, New York, New York, 2003. .Nash, Gary B.

Otis considered himself a loyal subject to the Crown, yet he argued against the writs of assistance in a nearly five-hour oration before a select audience in the State House in February 1761. His argument failed to win his case, but it galvanized the revolutionary movement. John Adams recollected years later: \\"Otis was a flame of fire; with a promptitude of classical allusions, a depth of research, a rapid summary of historical events and dates, a profusion of legal authorities.\\" Adams promoted Otis as a major player in the coming of the Revolution. Adams said, \\"I have been young and now I am old, and I solemnly say I have never known a man whose love of country was more ardent or sincere, never one who suffered so much, never one whose service for any 10 years of his life were so important and essential to the cause of his country as those of Mr. Otis from 1760 to 1770.\\" Adams claimed that \\"the child independence was then and there born, every man of an immense crowded audience appeared to me to go away as I did, ready to take arms against writs of assistance.\\" Otis expanded his argument in a pamphlet published in 1765 to state that the general writs violated the British constitution harkening back to the Magna Carta. The text of his 1761 speech was much enhanced by Adams on several occasions; it was first printed in 1773 and in longer forms in 1819 and 1823. According to James R. Ferguson,Ferguson, 1979 the four tracts that Otis wrote during 1764‚Äì65 reveal contradictions and even intellectual confusion. Otis was the first leader of the period to develop distinctive American theories of constitutionalism and representation, but he relied on traditional views of Parliamentary authority. He refused to follow the logical direction of his natural law theory by drawing back from radicalism, according to Ferguson, who feels that Otis appears inconsistent. Samuelson, on the other hand, argues that Otis should be seen as a practical political thinker rather than a theorist, and that explains why his positions changed as he adjusted to altered political realities and exposed the constitutional dilemmas of colonial parliamentary representation and the relationship between Great Britain and the North American colonies.Samuelson, 1999 Otis did not identify himself as a revolutionary; his peers, too, generally viewed him as more cautious than the incendiary Samuel Adams. Otis at times counseled against the mob violence of the radicals and argued against Adams's proposal for a convention of all the colonies resembling that of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Yet, on other occasions, Otis exceeded Adams in rousing passions and exhorting people to action. He even called his compatriots to arms at a town meeting on September 12, 1768, according to some accounts. Patriot and pamphleteer Otis was originally in the rural Popular Party, but he effectively made alliances with Boston merchants and he grew in popularity after the controversy over the writs of assistance. He was elected by an overwhelming margin to the provincial assembly a month later. He subsequently wrote several important patriotic pamphlets, served in the assembly, and was a leader of the Stamp Act Congress. He also was friends with Thomas Paine, the author of Common Sense. He was banished from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Watertown in 1743, and he suffered from increasingly erratic behavior as the 1760s progressed. He received a gash on the head from the tax collector John Robinson's cudgel at the British Coffee House in 1769. Some attribute Otis's mental illness to this event alone, but John Adams, Thomas Hutchinson, and many others mention his mental illness well before 1769. The blow to the head probably made it worse and, shortly after, he could no longer continue his work. By the end of the decade, Otis's public life largely came to an end, though he was able to do occasional legal practice during times of clarity. Otis asserted that blacks had inalienable rights, and he favored extending the freedoms of life, liberty, and property to them. The idea of racial equality also permeates his Rights of the British Colonies (1764), in which he states: Later life and death James Otis's grave in the Granary Burying Ground The decline in Otis's mental health was noted by friends and foes alike. In February 1771, John Adams wrote that Otis was \\"raving mad, raving against father, wife, brother, sister, friend.\\" Thomas Hutchinson wrote to Governor Bernard in December 1771 that \\"Otis was carried off today in a postchaise, bound hand and foot. He has been as good as his word‚Äîset the Province in a flame and perished in the attempt.\\" Otis spent the remainder of his life battling mental illness while living with friends and family in the Massachusetts countryside. Massachusetts Governor John Hancock held a dinner in his honor in 1783, but the event was too much for Otis's fragile mental state and he returned to the countryside. Near the end of his life, Otis burned the majority of his papers without explanation. Historians and biographers have access to his published papers, but this act prevented deeper insights into his life and thoughts that are available for other historical figures. On May 23, 1783, Otis was killed by a bolt of lightning while watching a thunderstorm from the doorway of a friend's home. Selected published works * The Rudiments of Latin Prosody (1760). Otis published the first of two treatises on prosody, and his alma mater Harvard eventually adapted it as a textbook. * A Vindication of the Conduct of the House of Representatives (1762). The first political publication by Otis. Here he uses an example of an expenditure not sanctioned by the colonial legislature as the foundation of his theory that taxes can be charged only by a representative government. In effect, he summarizes the argument that held a central place in Revolutionary rhetoric. * The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved (1764). This pamphlet sets down another important philosophy underpinning the Revolutionary debate: it asserts that rights are not derived from human institutions, but from nature and God. Thus, government does not exist to please monarchs but to promote the good of the entire society. * Considerations on Behalf of the Colonists (1765). This pamphlet expands the author's argument from The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved. He furthers the notion of natural rights by linking it to the theory of equal representation. In this year, he also authored the pamphlets Vindication of the British Colonies and Brief Remarks on the Defence of the Halifax Libel, Otis's last, in which he grants Parliament complete authority over the colonies. Scholars have settled on two explanations for his drastic reversal: either he temporarily became mentally ill, or he intended to use these pieces to defend himself against charges of treason.

Established to promote informed management of the nation's estuaries and coastal habitats, national estuarine research reserves inspire solutions for healthy coasts and maintain strong local economies, effectively functioning as America's bridge between freshwater and salt. Located in the southern subregion of the Chesapeake Bay, the nation's largest estuary, CBNERR-VA is a steward of four unique reserves that protect a diversity of estuarine habitat: Sweet Hall Marsh, Taskinas Creek, Catlett Islands and the Goodwin Islands. This multi-component system is situated along the York River's salinity gradient, making CBNERR-VA the foremost authority on York River estuarine habitat and water quality. CBNERR- VA is administered as a partnership between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), while managed on a daily basis by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS). As such, its research informs local, state and national policy. As a leader in regional estuarine coastal education, CBNERR-VA builds capacity among current and future decision makers, resource stewards and voters.  Mission  The mission of CBNERR-VA is to exhibit leadership in coastal zone management through innovative estuarine and coastal watershed science and education programs that promote natural resource stewardship and science-based solutions to complex socioecological challenges. To fulfill its mission, CBNERR-VA advances scientific understanding of watershed and estuarine systems, conducts education and training programs, conserves coastal resources, and provides advisory service through two topical areas of focus that holistically address local, regional and national issues; they include: * Coastal response and mitigation to environmental change, and * Water quality monitoring and assessment to address aquatic life and societal needs. The reserve's mission complements the three-part mission of VIMS to conduct interdisciplinary research in coastal ocean and estuarine science, educate students and citizens, and provide advisory service to policy makers, industry and the public.

The typeface was specially designed for use at very small point sizes in Van Dale's Dictionary of the Dutch Language. History Lexicon was De Does' second typeface, his first one being Trinit√©. After the release of Trinit√©, De Does held a lecture at the 1983 edition of ATypI. Some of his peers had asked him when his next typeface would be released, and in his lecture he announced that there would be no new typefaces from his hand. According to him, he would not be able to design something significantly different from the Renaissance inspired roman like Trinit√©. In 1989 however, he was approached by the designer of the Van Dale dictionary, who wanted to test Trinit√© for use at 7pt. De Does suggested to specially design a new typeface instead. The first rough drawings were made with a felt- tipped pen, and then photographically reduced to be able to judge the design at the right size. The editors of the dictionary were happy with the results, and accepted the offer to produce the typeface. De Does worked together with Peter Matthias Noordzij, who used Ikarus to digitize the drawings that De Does made. The first version of 1992 was optimized for legibility at the point sizes that were used in the dictionary. The version that is published by The Ensched√© Font Foundry (TEFF) was released in 1995. Characteristics As a result of this, there are two versions of Lexicon: Lexicon no. 1 and Lexicon no. 2. The difference between these two lie in the ascenders: Lexicon no. 1 is basically the dictionary version, which has very short ascenders, while Lexicon no. 2 has ascenders of a more regular length. Lexicon has been designed for optimal legibility, specifically when set very small. This is achieved, in part, by its large x-height‚Äîresulting in open counters‚Äîand by the relatively small capital letters. Just as Trinit√©, Lexicon shows a strong calligraphic influence, specifically that of the broad-nibbed pen. Both versions of Lexicon consist of a roman and an italic, all in six weights (named with letters A to F). There are several types of numbers available; tabular old-style figures, tabular lining figures, proportional old-style figures, and superior and inferior figures. Applications * The typeface is still being used by the Van Dale dictionary. * The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad (and nrc‚Ä¢next) used the typeface from 2001 until 2013. De Does designed a special version to be used for the large headlines. * The ESV Study Bible published in America by Crossway uses the typeface for its body text. * The Slovak Ecumenical Bible (interconfessional translation) first published in 2007 (1st corrected ed. 2008, 2nd corrected [pocket] ed. 2011) uses this typeface. * The contemporary art magazine ArtReview has used the typeface since its 2013 redesign. * Cambridge University Press publishes various English versions of the Bible using this typeface.

She was the daughter of Sviatopolk II, Grand Prince of Kiev by his first wife, who according to some historians was a Premyslid princess.The assumption that Sviatopolk II's first wife was a Bohemian princess was made by the historian Aleksandr Nazarenko: according to him, Polish chronicles stated that was necessary to obtain the Pope's dispensation for Zbyslava's marriage, because she and her husband are closely related. This is understandable, if is true the version that Sviatopolk II was the son of Gertrude of Poland. However, Nazarenko drew attention to the \\"Gertrude Psalter\\", in which she calls Prince Yaropolk unicus filius meus (my only son) and in consequence, Sviatopolk II could be an illegitimate child. In this case, the link that makes Zbyslava and her husband close relatives, must go through the female line: between Boles≈Çaw III (son of Princess Judith of Bohemia) and Zbyslava's mother, the first wife of Sviatopolk II. This fact allows Nazarenko come to a conclusion regarding the origin and identity of this woman. From his point of view, she was the daughter of Spytihnev II, Duke of Bohemia (d. 1061) by his wife Ida, sister of Dedi I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark (whose stepdaughter Cunigunde of Orlam√ºnde married with Prince Yaropolk, Sviatopolk II's brother). A. V. Nazarenko, International Relations of Ancient Rus, p. 576. Life During his fight against his half-brother Zbigniew, the Junior Duke of Poland, Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, allied himself with Kievan Rus' and Hungary. In order to seal his alliance with the Grand Prince of Kiev, Boles≈Çaw III was betrothed to his eldest daughter Zbyslava. The Primary Chronicle names Zbyslava, daughter of Svyatopolk when recording that she was taken to Poland on 16 November 1102 to marry Boles≈Çaw III.Russian Primary Chronicle (1102), ed. 1973, p. 199. Thus, the marriage took place between that date or in early 1103. They had only one known son, the future W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the Exile, born in 1105,Gallus Anonymus recorded the birth of a second son from Boles≈Çaw III and Zbyslava, but modern historians believed that this child never existed. Oswald Balzer placed the birth of this son between 1107/08; O.

He is the only American to earn the Distinguished Service Cross in three different wars. In addition to his three Distinguished Service Crosses, he was awarded the Silver Star, two Legions of Merit, five Purple Hearts, two French Croix de Guerre, the French Legion of Honor, and the Italian Bronze Medal of Military Valor. Early life A native of Briggsville, Wisconsin, Champeny was a graduate of Washburn College in Topeka, Kansas. While at Washburn, he was a member of the Kansas Beta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta and inducted into the school's exclusive Sagamore Society. World War I Champeny earned his first Distinguished Service Cross in September 1918 for bravery near St.-Mihiel in the northeast of France, while serving as 1st Lieutenant, 356th Infantry Regiment, 89th Infantry Division. His Distinguished Service Cross citation reads: World War II Champeny was awarded his second Distinguished Service Cross (or more accurately a first Oak Leaf Cluster to the award) in connection with military operations near Infante Santa Maria in Italy, May 1944. His second Distinguished Service Cross citation reads: > The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak > Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Service Cross to > Arthur S.

Korea Following the end of World War II, Lieutenant General John R. Hodge appointed Champeny the first Director of National Defense in Korea. Though he was still a colonel, he wore the rank of a brigadier general while serving in this position. Champeny was the author of the Bamboo Plan to create a police reserve or constabulary of 25,000 men. Champeny was responsible for organizing Korean Army and Navy and signed the commission documents for its first officers. He was also later the Seoul area commander. Later, Champeny was Deputy Military Governor and then Civil Administrator of Korea. Following the outbreak of combat, Champeny was named commander of the segregated 24th Infantry Regiment, 25th Division replacing Colonel Horton V. White. At the time of his appointment, Champeny was 57 years old making him more than two years older than the division commander. The Distinguished Service Cross Champeny's command of the Regiment was brief and controversial. The day after taking command, Champeny reportedly told members of the Regiment's 3rd battalion that his experience during World War II showed that \\"coloreds did not make good combat soldiers\\" and had a \\"reputation for running\\".Bowers, William T.; Hammond, William M.; MacGarrigle,George L.; Black Soldier, White Army: The 24th Infantry Regiment in Korea, Page 133. Champeny later defended his comments as an attempt to stir the unit's pride and the historical evidence is mixed as to its impact. Champeny's defense of his actions did not convince many of the Regiment's black troops. \\"I found Colonel Champeny biased, gutless and totally inefficient.\\" He was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross and a fifth Purple Heart for military operations near Haman in Korea, serving as Commander of 24th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. The citation reads: As a result of his injuries, Champeny was evacuated to Japan and replaced as regimental commander by Colonel John T. Corley. Bernice Champeny Cradler of Hartland, Wisconsin, Champeny's sister, told the Waukesha Daily Freeman in 1953 that the general had been offered command of the 24th Infantry Division when its commander, Major General William F. Dean, was captured by North Korean forces on August 25, 1950. Champeny reportedly did not accept the post as he was still in Japan recovering from his wounds. In July 1951 Champeny was promoted to brigadier general and assumed duty as Deputy Chief, Korean Military Advisory Group under Major general Cornelius E. Ryan. While in this capacity, Champeny was co- responsible for the transformation of the Republic of Korea Army into a fighting force capable of carrying its weight in United States Eighth Army and make Korean Military Advisory Group responsive to the needs of the Republic of Korea Army. He also held additional duty as the senior advisor to the Replacement Training and Schools Command (RTSC), responsible for operations of the Replacement Training Command and the individual branch training facilities. He was involved in gaining of the support in the restart of the pre-war program of sending Koreans to the United States for basic and advance infantry and artillery training. Champeny earned the support from the U.S. Army Infantry and Artillery Schools and eventually secured the support of the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, Lieutenant General Maxwell D. Taylor. Unfortunately, Champeny had little influence in the final form of the ROKA‚Äôs individual training programs because of personal disagreements with General Ryan and key members of his staff, which ultimately led to the loss of General James Van Fleet‚Äôs confidence and his relief and reduction in rank. Champeny returned to the United States and retired in 1953 after 35 years on active duty. He and his wife retired to Oxford, Kansas.

Sunbeam III was built as a civilian motorboat of the same name in 1917 by the Charles L. Seabury Company and the Gas Engine and Power Company at Morris Heights in the Bronx, New York. Her owner, Mr. R. B. Roosevelt of New York City, loaned her to the U.S. Navy under a free lease agreement for World War I service as a patrol vessel. She was delivered to the Navy on 16 June 1917 and commissioned as USS Sunbeam III (SP-251) on 18 July 1917. Sunbeam III was assigned to section patrol duty to protect antisubmarine nets in the New York Harbor area for the remainder of World War I. Sunbeam III was stricken from the Navy List on 21 January 1919 and returned to Roosevelt. This craft appears to be the same Sunbeam which was sold to a new owner in 1923, and through navigation error, found itself stranded in the Niagara River.

It was first observed by American astronomer James Scotti on 6 November 1991, using the Spacewatch telescope on Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States.  Earth-like orbit  On 6 November 1991, Scotti discovered a faint object which was designated 1991 VG soon after discovery. The object's heliocentric orbit was found to be very similar to Earth's orbit and it was calculated that it would make a close approach to Earth in the month after discovery at 1.2 lunar distances or on 5 December 1991. 1991 VG also passed 0.0568 AU from Earth on 7 August 2017. Given such an Earth-like orbit, the dynamical lifetime of such an object is relatively short with the object quickly either impacting Earth or being perturbed by Earth onto a different orbit. The similarity of its orbit with Earth was also very difficult to explain from natural sources, with ejecta from a recent Lunar impact or non-gravitational perturbations such as the Yarkovsky effect having been suggested. The first Earth Trojan asteroid, , was later identified and such objects could well be a source for objects like 1991 VG. 1991 VG has been a transient co-orbital of the horseshoe type in the past and it will return as such in the future; it was a natural satellite of Earth for about a month since 1992. This temporary capture may have taken place multiple times in the past and it is expected to repeat again in the future. It had an eccentricity of less than 1 with respect to the Earth from 23 February to 21 March 1992.  Possible monolithic structure  Since the discovery of 1991 VG, about 80% of small asteroids with absolute magnitudes fainter than 22.0 (corresponding to sizes smaller than about 200 meters) which have had their lightcurve measured have rotation periods under 2 hours. The so-called fast rotators are typically monolithic bodies or, alternatively, welded conglomerates with a sufficient intrinsic strength to counteract centrifugal forces. More slowly rotating asteroids are sometimes gravitationally bound aggregates or rubble piles.  Possible artificial origin  The uncertainty of the object's origin, combined with rapid variation in the object's brightness in images obtained during its close passage with Earth in early December 1991, led to some speculation that 1991 VG might be a spent rocket fuel tank. There was speculation that it could be a rocket body from a satellite launched in the early 1970s, or from Apollo 12 mission. A detailed analysis of the available evidence confirms that there is no compelling reason to believe that 1991 VG is not natural. As of 2018, with a highly accurate orbit, it is highly unlikely that 1991 VG is artificial, as it did not approach anywhere near Earth at any point since 1900.  Recovery  1991 VG was not observed between 1992 and 2017. But after 26 years, 1991 VG had returned to the vicinity of Earth. As part of a program by ESA and ESO to secure the orbit of faint but potentially threatening Near-Earth Objects, 1991 VG was recovered by the ESO VLT on 30 May 2017, at magnitude 25. With this recovery, the orbit of 1991 VG is now determined with a high precision. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 1 June 2017. The fact that it has stayed on a stable orbit for many years indicates not only that it is an inert object (i.e. not an active spacecraft), but also that its density is fairly high: an empty fuel tank, for instance, would have its orbit slightly changing in time due to the radiation pressure from the Sun. This strengthens the probability that 1991 VG is a near Earth asteroid. It was last observed 1 June 2017. Exploration The Near-Earth Asteroid Scout is a planned mission by NASA to develop a low-cost CubeSat solar sail spacecraft capable of encountering near- Earth asteroids and taking high resolution images. It is expected to launch in 2021, and 1991 VG is the planned target.

History The first record of Coven (as Cove) is in the Domesday Book (1086); when it was listed as being held by William de Stafford. Prior to the Norman Conquest it was held by the Saxon ceorl Alric. Iron-making was carried on at a furnace and two forges near to the village from the seventeenth century or earlier.

He spent ‚Ç¨250,000 in his time as Ceann Comhairle and ‚Ç¨550,000 in his time as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. His wife Kate-Ann also enjoyed many of the expenses. Tabloid newspapers referred to the politician with titles such as \\"Johnny Cash\\". The Irish Green Party, junior coalition partners in government, requested a reform of the system following the revelations. The accountant in charge of expenses had also resigned in protest at the system. O'Donoghue was the first Ceann Comhairle to forcefully resign; however, Patrick Hogan resigned the post for health reasons in 1967. O'Donoghue announced his resignation from the position of Ceann Comhairle on the evening of 6 October 2009, effective as of 13 October 2009. The Irish Independent opined: \\"Were Louis the XIV around today, the Sun King would likely be envious of the lavish style that John O'Donoghue brought to public office\\". The Australian noted that the controversy followed just three months after a similar one brought down Michael Martin of the United Kingdom. The Observer blamed his fall on \\"a keen interest in racing\\", particularly his trips to Aintree, Cheltenham and the Melbourne Cup. David Sharrock of The Times suggested the government was \\"close to collapse\\" and contrasted the expenses with a report that one school in Ireland had requested children to bring their own toilet paper to classes. Details of expenses As Ceann Comhairle, O'Donoghue employed seven more office staff than the previous Ceann Comhairle who managed with three staff. O'Donoghue and Brendan Howlin shared a \\"working dinner\\" in June 2007. The cost of the ‚Ç¨293 meal was paid for by O'Donoghue. He also dined regularly in Michelin-starred restaurants, on many occasions with his wife. Four trips to Britain in 2006 and 2007 led to ‚Ç¨21,000 expenses claims for hiring cars. He claimed expenses on a ¬£1 sterling donation which he personally gave to UNICEF when in Scotland. The donation was part of the hotel bill. The total bill for his stay there from 21 January until 24 January 2009 came to ‚Ç¨801.70. He regularly attended horse racing sessions and even brought his wife, secretary and other officials to the Melbourne Cup in Australia in 2003. He returned in 2005, telling a magazine the following year that: \\"There's nothing quite like Melbourne Cup day in Australia\\". He claimed expenses of ‚Ç¨600 on a limousine to take him to horse racing at Aintree. He claimed for another limousine to carry him between terminals at Heathrow Airport in London. The total claimed for this limousine was ‚Ç¨472. He claimed nearly ‚Ç¨900 per night for a 2006 stay in the Radisson Hotel in Liverpool. He resided in one hotel in Paris where rooms cost ‚Ç¨633 per night. Many of the expenses were claimed for tips he gave ‚Äì one of these amounted to almost ‚Ç¨200. He purchased many gifts such as ‚Ç¨882 worth of items from the House of Ireland shop and 2006 Midleton whiskey which totalled ‚Ç¨135. ‚Ç¨4,956 was claimed on the hire of limousines during a trip to several cities in the United States. ‚Ç¨11,869 in expenses was claimed on advertisements displayed in local newspapers in his native Kerry. On 6 October 2009, it was revealed that O'Donoghue had spent more than ‚Ç¨20,000 at nine different race meetings internationally over the four-year period of 2003‚Äì2007. The controversy is the subject of a book Snouts in the Trough by journalist Ken Foxe, who originally broke the story in the Sunday Tribune. Events surrounding resignation On 11 September 2009, O'Donoghue sent a letter to every TD in which he said he had done nothing wrong. He made his first public comments on his expenses on 15 September 2009 whilst attending the races in Listowel, claiming to have \\"behaved in good faith and with probity throughout\\" and ending with \\"in so far as one regrets something, I think that is an apology\\". The following day, O'Donoghue made a proper public apology for his expenses claimed while in office as Irish Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. He also issued a statement, saying: \\"I was not aware of the cost of these arrangements. When I read the detail in the past weeks, I was embarrassed that such costs were associated with some of the arrangements made on my behalf\\". O'Donoghue released his expenses record for the previous two years on 2 October 2009. These revealed foreign travels bills totalling ‚Ç¨45,000, ‚Ç¨13,000 for the hiring of cars and limousines to travel between airport terminals when outside Ireland and slightly less than ‚Ç¨5,000 in total in fees for VIP lounges. Sinn F√©in were the first party to call for O'Donoughue to resign, with D√°il leader Caoimhgh√≠n √ì Caol√°in stating O'Donoghues position was untenable given \\"a continued waste of public money\\" since he took the job. Eamon Gilmore, leader of the Labour Party, openly expressed an opinion that O'Donoghue was bringing the office of Ceann Comhairle into disrepute and requested a meeting with the leaders of D√°il √âireann's other political parties on the matter. Enda Kenny, leader of Fine Gael, called on O'Donoghue to sort himself out or he would be expected to resign. John Gormley, leader of Green Party, asked for the matter to be resolved urgently. O'Donoghue responded to these criticisms by saying he would address the Oireachtas Commission where he would give \\"detailed proposals\\". He announced details of his resignation as Ceann Comhairle at 22:30 the following evening after pressure from Gilmore, who said his reign was now \\"untenable\\", backed by Kenny. However, Kenny requested that he resign the role with immediate effect. O'Donoghue quit the post on 13 October 2009. Before doing so he made a statement on his expenses. S√©amus Kirk was elected his successor. It was later revealed that O'Donoghue had told Gilmore twice via telephone before his resignation not to \\"do anything precipitous\\". Reaction Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, at a book signing in Belfast to promote the release of his autobiography, expressed his sorrow for O'Donoghue. Ahern nominated O'Donoghue for the position of Ceann Comhairle in 2007. He told BBC Radio: > John O'Donoghue was an outstanding Minister for Justice, an outstanding > Minister for Tourism, Arts and Sport. He did travel abroad. Tourism was an > all-island subject and he went to the cultural events and sporting events > and knowing John I think a lot of those events he would have been happier > not to be going to.

Ahern also used a promotional television appearance on The Late Late Show on RT√â One to defend O'Donoghue, claiming he had been \\"dumped on\\". Irish Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan Jnr criticised the forceful nature of O'Donoghue's resignation, claiming he had not been allowed to explain himself. Irish Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen accused the media of having \\"extremely distorted\\" the expenses claims. He criticised what he termed as \\"the denigration of decent people who had served for a long period of time\\", claiming that \\"anybody that goes abroad for this country [Ireland] works extremely hard, and it is unfortunate that it is presented all the time as some kind of junket\\". He also claimed he would prefer to spend Saint Patrick's Day at home \\"rather than attending 24 functions in 48 hours\\" as was the case in 2009, according to Cullen. Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche√°l Martin described the expenses situation as \\"damaging\\". Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae said on Radio Kerry: > This is a sad situation to see John O'Donoghue go like this [...] The man > was hounded out of office, there's no doubt about it. Kerry former footballer and manager P√°id√≠ √ì S√© said on Newstalk: > Eamon Gilmore got the head of John O'Donoghue, and what Fine Gael is trying > to do now is to get the left ear of his decapitated head. Mayor of Kilkenny, Malcolm Noonan of the Green Party, reacted positively to O'Donoghue's resignation, saying \\"Oireachtas members are well paid for their work, there should be absolutely no abuse of the system\\" particularly whilst \\"so many people and communities are suffering\\". Gerald Kean, a prominent celebrity solicitor, said O'Donoghue's behaviour was \\"absolutely, totally unacceptable\\". Aftermath O'Donoghue received ‚Ç¨112,000, described as a \\"golden parachute\\" payment. He announced his intention to seek election again at the next opportunity ‚Äì \\"standing for re-election in South Kerry, definitely\\". He lost his seat at the 2011 general election. Further revelations were also disclosed, including ‚Ç¨1,000 spent on two tickets for the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final in Paris, despite O'Donoghue being Ceann Comhairle at that time and no longer Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. The tickets were requested from the Irish Sports Council by O'Donoghue; the Council explained: \\"It was decided to offer him the tickets on a complimentary basis in recognition of his efforts on behalf of Irish sport\\".

A graduate of the Canterbury College School of Art (now the University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts) he returned there to teach for more than 30 years. He was tutored by many well-known Canterbury artists, including Colin Lovell-Smith, Evelyn Page and Archibald Nicoll and gained his Diploma of Fine Arts in 1937. In 1947 he travelled to London where he studied for a time at the Anglo-French centre in St John's Wood. On returning to New Zealand in 1949 he took up a teaching position at Canterbury University College School of Art and was appointed senior lecturer in 1959. During the 1940s and 1950s Sutton followed in the tradition of fellow Canterbury artists, such as Rita Angus, Colin and Rata Lovell-Smith and Louise Henderson, developing a distinctive interpretation of the Canterbury landscape. Sutton continued to teach at the school until his retirement in 1979. Sutton continued to paint until 1993. In the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours, Sutton was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to art. Sutton's paintings are typically signed / credited as WA Sutton. Much of his work shows the influence of New Zealand regionalism as with fellow Cantabrian Rita Angus. In 1963, Sutton built a house in Templar Street in the Christchurch suburb of Richmond. Until his retirement in 1992, he painted most of his works there. The house was bought by a former curator of the Robert McDougall Art Gallery and it was his intention to gift it as a home for an artist in residence scheme. Following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the house is located in the Residential Red Zone and was thus purchased by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority; it is hoped for the house to be kept despite the red zoning. A retrospective of his work was held at Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhet≈´ in 2003 In March 2009, Sutton was commemorated as one of the Twelve Local Heroes, and a bronze bust of him was unveiled outside the Christchurch Arts Centre.

Camp Warner was located at two different sites approximately apart. The Army called both sites Camp Warner. However, the first site became known as Old Camp Warner. It was used as winter quarters in 1866‚Äì1867 and then abandoned. The second, more developed site is generally known as Fort Warner (or New Camp Warner), although the Army never officially designated it as a fort. Fort Warner was used as a supply depot and administrative headquarters from 1867 to 1874 during a protracted Army campaign against Northern Paiute bands in Eastern Oregon and Northern California. Today, nothing remains of either Old Camp Warner or Fort Warner.  Old Camp Warner  In 1865, the Army decided it needed an outpost in the Warner Valley of south-central Oregon to facilitate the interdiction of Indian raiding parties passing through the area. Army scouts from Fort Vancouver selected a site along Honey Creek on the west side of the Warner Lakes in what is today Lake County, Oregon. In 1866, a unit of the 14th Infantry Regiment was sent from Fort Boise to establish the fort. The 14th Infantry came by way of Fort Harney, arriving on the east side of the Warner Lakes in late summer. The Army was unable to cross the Warner Lakes, a chain of lakes and wetlands that stretches more than north to south. As a result, the soldiers decided to build their outpost east of the lakes on the eastern slope of Hart Mountain. It was completed on August 10, 1866. The post was named Camp Warner after Captain William H. Warner, a topographical engineer who had explored the area before being killed by Indians in 1849.\\"Stone Bridge and the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road\\", National Register of Historic Places Inventory ‚Äì Nomination Form, National Register of Historic Places, United States Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 13 August 1974.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

Warner\\", History of the Fremont National Forest, Fremont National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Lakeview, Oregon, 1981, p. 12. The camp was hastily built at an elevation of , so it was not well suited for the harsh winters typical of Oregon's high desert country. As a result, the men had a very difficult winter. It was reported that on several occasions, it was so cold inside the camp building the entire detachment had to march around the parade ground all night to keep from freezing.Bach, Melva M., \\"Camp Warner Moved to Honey Creek ‚Äì 1867\\", History of the Fremont National Forest, Fremont National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Lakeview, Oregon, 1981, p. 14-16. One sergeant did freeze to death during a winter snow storm.  Fort Warner  In the spring of 1867, the 14th Infantry was replaced by a company of the 23rd Infantry Regiment. In February, General George Crook visited Camp Warner. Crook directed that the camp be moved to the Honey Creek site west of the Warner Lakes. To get the Army's wagons and equipment across the wetlands, forty men under the command of Captain James Henton were assigned to build a bridge across a narrow, marshy channel between Hart Lake and Crump Lake. The bridge was constructed between May 16 and July 24, 1867. Known as the Stone Bridge, it was actually a quarter mile long causeway constructed by hauling basalt boulders and smaller rocks from nearby Hart Mountain and dumping them into the marsh. Shortly after the bridge was begun, Crook sent a second detachment ahead to construct the new camp. On July 31, 1867, the Army moved into the new camp. Initially, Crook proposed that the new post be named Camp Wood. However, in a formal dispatch dated August 28, 1867, Major General Henry W. Halleck, commander of the Military Department of the Pacific, disapproved naming the post Camp Wood and suggested retaining the name Camp Warner.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Fort Harney\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 367. The soldiers assigned to the post called it Fort Warner to distinguish it from the original Camp Warner, which was only away. While the Army never officially designated it as a fort, the post became widely known as Fort Warner. Today, most modern maps, including United States Geological Survey topographical maps, identify the site as Fort Warner. General George Crook on patrol in Indian country Fort Warner was located on the west side of the Warner Valley, in a pine forest from the lakes. The new site had a large freshwater spring and enough good timber to support a sawmill. This allowed the soldiers to construct solid timber frame barracks for 280 troops, officer's quarters, warehouses, and other buildings. In addition, Fort Warner was roughly lower in elevation than Old Camp Warner so milder winters were anticipated at the new location. However, the elevation at Fort Warner was above sea level so winters were still quite severe.Hart, Herbert M., Tour Guide to Old Western Forts, Pruitt Publishing Company, Boulder, Colorado, 1980, pp. 137-138. Fort Warner was an Army supply depot and administrative headquarters from 1867 until 1874. During the first two years of that period, General Crook led companies from the 1st Cavalry Regiment and 8th Cavalry Regiment, mounted infantry from the 9th Infantry Regiment and 23rd Infantry Regiment, and Indian scouts from the Wasco and Warm Springs tribes in a successful campaign against Northern Paiute bands in Eastern Oregon and Northern California. This was part of the conflict known as the Snake War. Fort Warner was one of several outposts used to refit and resupply Crook's troops during the campaign. Mrs. Crook and several other military wives arrived in 1867 and made Fort Warner their home.\\"The Snake War, 1864-1868\\", Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series (Number 236), Idaho State Historical Society, Boise, Idaho, 1966.Bourke, John G. (Captain, 3rd Cavalry, U.S.A), \\"General Crook in the Indian Country\\", The Century Magazine (Vol. XLI, No. 5), The Century Company, March 1891, pp. 644-649. By 1869, the Indian raids in south-central Oregon had ended and a treaty had been signed with Wewawewa, the chief of the area's dominant Paiute band. In 1872, Fort Warner was manned by the D Company of the 21st Infantry Regiment. However, with no Indian raiders left in the area, Fort Warner was abandoned on September 3, 1874.Ebstein, Fred. H. E.

Historic sites  Today, very little evidence of Army occupation remains at either Old Camp Warner or Fort Warner. The original Camp Warner site is now part of the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge. There is virtually nothing left to mark the camp except for two Army graves. The Fort Warner site is located on a privately owned ranch adjacent to Fremont National Forest. No Army buildings remain at the Fort Warner location, but the footprints where structures once stood can still be identified. While nothing remains at either military site, the Stone Bridge the Army built to cross the Warner wetlands still exists and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

This period saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, some of which were empires that exerted influence far and wide. It is also named as a source of their cultural materials and traditions, transmitted orally from one generation to another either by messages or testimony or speech or song or street theatre and many other forms. The Story The tale is a story of two brothers, known as Ponnar also known as Periya Annan (elder brother) and Shankar also known as Chinna Annan (younger brother), revered as the Annanmar Swami. Ponnar and Shankar are Kongars ( Ganga Kula Gounder).The story has been recited and passed on as a folk tale through many generations in very rustic traditions as songs which were known as gramiya padalgal (folk songs) and have been enacted as folk entertainment through street theater which were known as Therru Koothu. The Ponnar-Sankar story starts from their grandfathers. The chieftain of the Vazhavanthi country in Chera kingdom (part of Southern Namakkal district) was Kolaththa Gounder, eldest among the twelve brothers. Kolaththa Gounder and his wife Pavalaththal decide to leave their country Perungudi because of atrocities of his unjust brothers. They go to Mathukkarai to Goddess Sellandiya Amman temple. In the temple, they find the three great kings, Chera King, Chola King and Pandya King, sitting in front of the goddess and re- drawing their disputed tri-nation borders as process to bring lasting peace and stability. They are in a conundrum and cannot agree on borders. Kolaththa Gounder finds a solution that is agreeable to all the three kings and resolves the dispute fairly. Impressed with this skill and solution, the Chola King gifts him the lordship to sizeable territory which back in the day could be akin to a size of a small country. The granted gift was called Konad. The couple went to Konadu and founded the initial settlements. The area was a vast wasteland but with their hard work and dedication they developed these wastelands into cultivable farm lands. With their ingenuity they had devised and laid out an extensive system of ponds and shallow pits and lakes which acted as catchment zones and increased the fertility of the lands which in turn made it more cultivable and fertile. Their efforts over time paid off, making the country prosperous. After a while the erstwhile Konad was renamed as Valanadu (Trichy District), also known as Ponni Valanadu. Meanwhile, Kolaththa Gounder‚Äôs brothers, who remained in Vazhavanthi country, faced severe droughts successively and reached out to seek refuge with their eldest brother, who was now the chieftain of Konadu. The eldest brother, as a brave Kongan, gave refuge to his eleven brothers within the borders of his country. Kolaththa Gounder and Pavalathathal were living a prosperous life, but they were unhappy that did not have a child to continue their lineage. So the couple sort divine grace to alleviate their unhappiness and made several temple visits far and near asking the great lord to bless with them children. After a long penance, they were blessed with a son whom they named Mannudaiya Gounder (later called as Kunnudaiya Gounder). Mannudaiya Gounder, as the boy, was sluggish and naive. Unfortunately for him, his parents died of natural causes, leaving the five-year-old to fend for himself. After the death of Kolaththa Gounder and Pavalathathal, the 11 brothers, already jealous of the prosperity and abundance, found an opportune moment to usurp their dead brother‚Äôs wealth and kingdom. The eleven brothers colluded and drove the young Mannudaiya Gounder out of Valanadu. As a young child he managed to wander his way into Aathi Chetti palayam (now near Puliyur, Karur district). He went to the home of a Chettiyar (Merchant) who traded rice bran. The chettiyar, a kind man, took young Mannudaiya Gounder into his house and sheltered him. Happenstance, after the arrival of Mannudaiya Gounder, the Chettiyar‚Äôs luck improved and he becomes very prosperous. Kunnadaiya Gounder married Thaamaraiya Goundachi and had sons Ponnar and Shankar. They also had a daughter, 'Thangammal'. Both ruled Ponni Valanadu and today. (Veerappur is a historic place region.)

He was a 1912 graduate of Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin where he played football. After graduation, he served as a member of the faculty at several colleges in the Midwest. During this time Roberts served as head football coach at Bethany College in Bethany, West Virginia (1914), Miami University in Oxford, Ohio (1915), and Platteville Normal College, now the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville (1917), compiling a career college football record of 11‚Äì10. He was also the head basketball coach at Bethany (1914‚Äì1915) and Miami (1915‚Äì1916), tallying a career college basketball mark of 9‚Äì18. Early life Roberts was born in Birnamwood, Wisconsin. He attended Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin from 1908 to 1912 where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. He did post graduate work at both University of Wisconsin and the University of Illinois, receiving a master's degree from Wisconsin. In 1913 he married Bessie Bushey of Appleton. Playing career Roberts was an All- State center for two years at Lawrence under coach Mark Catlin. In his last year at Lawrence he was part of the 1911 team that won the State Championship. This team's only loss was to Wisconsin by a score of 15‚Äì0. In the rest of the games they outscored their other opponents 100‚Äì0. In 1911 Roberts was named to the all-time Lawrence College football team by the local newspaper, the Appleton Evening Crescent. Coaching career After graduation from Lawrence, Roberts became an instructor at several colleges including Simpson College, Miami University, Bethany College, and Platteville Normal College. While serving as the member of the faculty at this college he also served as a coach of several sports. Bethany College After spending the 1912‚Äì13 academic year as an instructor physics and mathematics as well as an assistant coach at Simpson College, Roberts accepted a job at Bethany College as the Physical Director in 1914. In his only year as football coach he had a record of 3‚Äì4. The 1914 football team that Roberts coached lacked experience going into the season. Roberts moved Dougherty to quarterback from end. The team was led by Rogers at running back, who was known for broken field running and passing. He also served as basketball coach for the 1914‚Äì15 season where his team went 5‚Äì9. Miami University In 1915 Roberts was named an Assistant Professor of Physical Training at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio for the 1915‚Äì16 school year. Included in his duties were coaching the football and basketball team. At the time Miami was changing the philosophy of athletics moving to an all-year athletic coach. The man he replaced as head football coach, James C. Donnelly, took time off from his law practice in Massachusetts showing up in Oxford just for the football season. Roberts served as head coach of the 1915 Miami University football team. Among his players included Earl Blaik who went on to a College Football Hall of Fame coaching career, Marvin Pierce, father of Barbra Bush and grandfather of George W. Bush, and John E. Hull, who became a four-star general and Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The team finished with a record of 6‚Äì2 and a victory over rival Cincinnati in the last game of the season. The two losses were to Indiana of the Western Conference and Denison, one of Miami biggest rivals at that time. Down 14‚Äì0 against Denison, Roberts tried to encourage his team at halftime by offering to buy each player a box of bonbons if they won the game. This offer did not motivate the team; but it did shape Earl Blaik's coaching philosophy. Blaik later wrote about this enticement saying that \\"...in a Spartan game like football the worst possible inducement to a malingering player is, literally or figuratively, any form of sweetness.\\" Platteville Normal College After the 1915‚Äì16 academic year Roberts moved from Miami to Platteville Normal College in Platteville, Wisconsin now known as the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville to teach physical culture. While at Platteville Normal he also coached the football team to a 2‚Äì4 record for the 1917 season. After coaching After his coaching career, Roberts was employed by several companies in the paper and automobile industries in Wisconsin including Tuttle Press Co. in Appleton, Northern Paper Mills of Green Bay, Wisconsin, A. O. Smith of Milwaukee, and Nash Motors of Milwaukee. While at the Northern Paper Mills he received a patent for Core-tube cutter. In 1927, he was appointed manager of the industrial division of the Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, where he was in charge of maintaining existing manufacturers and recruiting new manufactures to Milwaukee. Roberts moved to California in 1940 and was associated there with the Lockheed Corporation. He died at the age of 57, on July 28, 1946, of a heart attack while visiting a friend in Sunset Beach, California.

Plot Dead Gods is composed of two adventures which revolve around the theme of death and resurrection of a god: \\"Out of the Darkness\\" and \\"Into the Light\\". Each adventure can be played separately, although the two plots can be woven together by the Dungeon Master.Cook, Monte. Dead Gods (TSR, 1997) \\"Out of the Darkness\\" consists of nine chapters. Long ago, Orcus the tanar'ri lord of the undead had grown fat and inattentive towards his realm in the Abyss. The minor demipower Kiaransalee, drow goddess of vengeance, conspired against Orcus and slew him, supplanting his realm and position and even banishing his name across the planes. Orcus‚Äô corpse lay dead on the Astral Plane for some time, until he began to stir in the not-so-distant past. His form changed to become thin, small and shadowy, but rather than being truly restored to life he had become an undead god much less powerful than before. Orcus eventually disappeared from the Astral and chose a new name for himself: Tenebrous. He sought to gain revenge on everyone in the multiverse, and raised his former demonic servants as undead called visages to gather information to aid in his vengeance. He returned to an old base of his, a fortress on the Negative Energy Plane, and on the plane of Arborea he found a magical force called the Last Word which was potent enough to slay even a god. Kiaransalee had sent two of her drow followers to bury his powerful artifact, the Wand of Orcus, in an unreachable vault of stone on the plane of Pandemonium. In his search for his Wand, Tenebrous used the Last Word to slay Primus, the lord of the modrons, and using Primus's form he began using the modrons to search for his Wand. When the modrons discovered the two drow who had buried the Wand, Tenebrous began making preparations to take back the Abyss. The player characters must follow the clues to discover Tenebrous's scheme and keep the Wand away from him long enough for the power of the Last Word to consume him; if they succeed, the characters must then stop one of Orcus's followers from reviving his corpse on the Astral Plane yet again, to conclude the adventure. \\"Into the Light\\" consists of three parts, and takes place in the city of Sigil. Many years ago, the last worshippers of a dead god brought the pieces of his body from the Astral Plane to Sigil and used the body to construct a monument of five standing stones. Some time later, when the significance of the monument had been forgotten, adherents of another religion built a temple around the standing stones; in time, this religion died out and was forgotten too. This church stood vacant for centuries until bought by a wealthy man named Cruigh Manathas, who ordered his workmen to tear it down. The workmen disappeared one day ‚Äì unknown to all, they had been absorbed into the standing stones, as were those who came to investigate what happened to the workmen. Secretly, a fighter named Argesh Fiord has been in control of the situation and is using it in an attempt to foment a war between some of the city's factions in revenge for the death of his wife. The player characters must uncover Fiord's plot in order to resolve the matter and prevent the war.

He wrote extensively on the history of Burma. His most notable work is A History of Southeast Asia, said to \\"...remain the most important single history of the region, providing encyclopedic coverage of material published up to the time of its 1981 revision.\\"Milton Osborne: Southeast Asia, An Introductory History. Published by Allen & Unwin, 2004. He held professorships in Southeast Asian history at both Cornell University and the University of London ‚Äì where he eventually became professor emeritus. Biography Early life Daniel George Edward Hall was born on 17 November 1891 into a farming family in Hertfordshire, England. His early education was at Hitchin Grammar School. He entered the Department of History in King's College London in 1913 and graduated in 1916 with a first-class honors degree in Modern History, winning the Gladstone Memorial Prize. Hall also won an Inglis Studentship that allowed him to gain a Master's degree from the University of London with a thesis on mercantile aspects of English foreign policy during the reign of Charles II. During the First World War Hall served in the army with Inns of Court Regiment, and also toured the Western Front with the Lena Ashworth concert party. Career In early 1919, Hall obtained a position as senior history master at Royal Grammar School, Worcester. Later that year Hall married Helen Eugenie Banks (who, two years his junior at King's College, had also been awarded the Gladstone Memorial Prize) and began teaching history at Bedales School, Hampshire. While at Bedales School, Hall was offered the position of chair of history at the recently founded University of Rangoon. Upon his arrival in Rangoon in May 1921, Hall was faced with a history syllabus was that was unsuited to the new university, being focussed on classical Greece, Rome and modern European history. His initial task therefore was to create courses and provide textbooks that were relevant to the needs of his Burmese students. It was while engaged in this task, and developing the local history content of the syllabus, that Hall became interested in Burmese culture and Asian studies. However his full-scale pursuit of these interests had to wait until he had completed the task of developing and teaching the Western history syllabus of the university. Thus it was not until 1927 that the first results of Hall's research into Anglo-Burmese relations was published with his paper ‚ÄúEnglish Relations with Burma, 1587‚Äì1686\\" published in the Journal of the Burma Research Society, 1927. The completion of further research, including The Dalhousie-Phayre Correspondence, led to Hall being awarded a degree of Doctor of Literature by the University of London. In 1934 Hall was forced to resign his chair in Rangoon and return to England due to his family having developed trachoma, which made it impossible for them to remain in the tropics. Upon his return to England Hall took up the position of Headmaster of Caterham School in Surrey. Hall left Caterham in 1949 when he was appointed chair of the History of South East Asia department at the University of London School of Oriental and African Studies. It was while at SOAS that Hall published his History of South-East Asia (1955), the center-piece of his work.

Mercury is present in the Earth's crust and in various forms on the Earth‚Äôs surface. It can be elemental, inorganic, or organic. Mercury exists in three oxidation states: 0 (elemental mercury), I (mercurous mercury), and II (mercuric mercury). Mercury emissions to the atmosphere can be primary sources, which release mercury from the lithosphere, or secondary sources, which exchange mercury between surface reservoirs. Annually, over 5000 Mg of mercury is released to the atmosphere by primary emissions and secondary re-emissions. Sources of mercury  Primary sources  Sample of the mercury sulfide ore, cinnabar Primary sources of mercury emissions can be natural or anthropogenic. Most natural mercury occurs as the mercury sulfide mineral, cinnabar, which is one of the only significant ores of mercury. Organic-rich sedimentary rocks can also contain elevated mercury. Weathering of minerals and geothermal activity release mercury to the environment. Active volcanoes are another significant primary source of natural mercury. Anthropogenic primary sources of mercury include gold mining, burning coal, and production of non-iron metals, such as copper or lead.  Secondary sources  Secondary natural sources, which re-emit previously deposited mercury, include vegetation, evasion from oceans and lakes, and biomass burning, including forest fires. Primary anthropogenic emissions are leading to increased sizes of mercury in surface reservoirs. Processes Mercury is transported and distributed by atmospheric circulation, which moves elemental mercury from the land to the ocean. Elemental mercury in the atmosphere is returned to the Earth's surface by several routes. A major sink of elemental mercury (Hg(0)) in the atmosphere is through dry deposition. Some of elemental mercury, on the other hand, is photooxidized to gaseous mercury(II), and is returned to the Earth's surface by both dry and wet deposition. Because photooxidation is very slow, elemental mercury can circulate over the entire globe before being oxidized and deposited. Wet and dry deposition is responsible for 90% of the mercury of surface waters, including open ocean. A fraction of deposited mercury instantaneously re- volatilize back to the atmosphere. Inorganic mercury can be converted by bacteria and archaea into methylmercury ([CH3Hg]+), which bioaccumulates in marine species such as tuna and swordfish and biomagnifies further up the food chain. Certain xenophyophores have been found to have abnormally high concentrations of mercury within their bodies.

It is located south of Newellton on Lake St. Joseph, an ox-bow lake, or former bend in the Mississippi River. History The main plantation house began as a hunting lodge in 1805 but was soon enlarged and became a residence. Before the Vicksburg Campaign of 1863 during the American Civil War, there were fifteen plantations along Lake St. Joseph. However, Union troops destroyed all of them except Winter Quarters, where the soldiers were housed during the winter of 1862‚Äì1863. The plantation belonged to Haller Nutt, a planter who was pro-Union. As a result, General Ulysses S. Grant ensured the plantation would be not be damaged. Wade A. Netterville (1876-1936), brother of the plantation manager J. H. Netterville of Newellton, managed the store at Winter Quarters in the early years of the 20th century, employed in that capacity by the then plantation owner Dr. J. M. Gillespie. Netterville then ran the store at Panola Plantation prior to becoming the manager for two years of the Wyoming Plantation. He subsequently assumed the management of the 1,000-acre Panda Plantation near the parish seat of government in St. Joseph.Henry E. Chambers, Chicago: A History of Louisiana, 1925), p. 372 During the 1950s, the James and Bea Doyle family lived at Winter Quarters. Their daughter, Barbara Sue Doyle Hage (1949-2016), was the 1962 March of Dimes poster child and at the time of her death at the age of sixty-six the oldest known survivor of spina bifida. Barbara Hage graduated in 1969 from Newellton High School and worked for a quarter century for the Louisiana State University Extension Service in St. Joseph. She was also a church pianist and vocalist, seamstress, and gardener. She and her husband, David C. Hage, had a daughter and two grandsons. In 1978, Winter Quarters was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and was previously open for public tours. The site was critically damaged in a tornado on April 4, 2011. As of February 2016, the site remains closed indefinitely and the State of Louisiana currently has no plans or a set date on reopening the site for public use.

Edmundo Fernandez, Ron del Barrilito's master blender  History   Origins  Hacienda Santa Ana's origins date back to Fernando Fern√°ndez. A native of Santander, Spain, Fern√°ndez came to Puerto Rico in 1787. He was bestowed large tracts of farmland located along Puerto Rico's northern coast, mostly used for growing sugarcane, one of the island's largest crops in that era. Fernando Fern√°ndez had two sons: Jos√© Ram√≥n and Manuel. Jos√© Ram√≥n, the oldest, inherited Hacienda La Esperanza in the town of Manat√≠, Puerto Rico. Manuel, the youngest, was left in charge of Hacienda Santa Ana in Bayam√≥n.  Beginning of rum production  Rum Production Hacienda Santa Ana Barrels Ron Barrilito Rum production at Hacienda Santa Ana's started during the family's third generation in Puerto Rico. During the mid 1860s, Pedro Fern√°ndez, one of Manuel's sons, went away to study engineering in France, where he developed an interest in the production of brandies and cognacs. Upon his return to Puerto Rico in 1871, taking a cue from the European custom of families producing their own liquors for their personal use and to entertain visitors, Pedro started producing rum. Although the rum was initially produced for private consumption, word started spreading amongst the Hacienda's frequent visitors that the rum produced by Pedro Fern√°ndez at Santa Ana was truly exceptional. The story goes that the rum was kept in a barrel at the Hacienda and that, whenever Pedro Fern√°ndez asked his visitors if they would care for a drink, more often than not, they asked for some ‚Äúrum from the small barrel‚Äù or, more endearingly in Spanish ‚Äúron del barrilito‚Äù, so in 1880, When Pedro Fern√°ndez decided to start selling rum, he used this phrase as the brand name. The name Ron del Barrilito, as well as the rum it describes and the label that distinguishes it, have remained unchanged since 1880.\\"Hacienda Santa Ana: Home of Ron del Barrilito\\", \\"Puerto Rico Day Trips\\", April 2014  Next generations  Edmundo Fern√°ndez, Hacienda Santa Ana In the early twentieth century, Edmundo Fern√°ndez, one of Pedro's sons, would follow in his father's footsteps as Ron del Barrilito's master blender. The century started with tremendous challenges for the family business. Puerto Rico, by then a territory of the United States, was subject to the 1920 Prohibition Amendment, which made it illegal to produce and sell alcoholic beverages anywhere in the country. Ron del Barrilito, as well as every other liquor and spirits manufacturer in the United States, had to cease operations immediately. In 1933, when the Prohibition Era ended, Edmundo Fern√°ndez resumed production, and introduced the first new product Ron del Barrilito would make in decades: whereas the blend first commercialized by Pedro Fern√°ndez in 1880 is what today is known as Ron del Barrilito Tres Estrellas (‚ÄúThree Stars‚Äù), but after Prohibition, Edmundo Fern√°ndez saw an opportunity to craft a younger rum, called Ron del Barrilito Dos Estrellas (‚ÄúTwo Stars‚Äù). Throughout the rest of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century, Edmundo's children and grandchildren continued to produce Ron del Barrilito, and Ron del Barrilito is still made at Hacienda Santa Ana using the same formula and in small batches.\\"Ron del Barrilito - Since 1880\\", \\"Ron del Barrilito\\" Hacienda Santa Ana is home to some of the oldest aging rum stocks in the Caribbean. One such example is ‚ÄúLa Do√±a,‚Äù a barrel that was filled and laid to age in 1952 by Edmundo Fern√°ndez. Nearly a century later, the barrel remains unopened and serves as symbol of national pride and family heritage. Ron del Barrilito rum  Methods  Much of Ron del Barrilito's formula remains a closely guarded family secret, apart from the fact that it is aged in vintage white oak barrels that previously held ‚Äúoloroso‚Äù sherry, and that no artificial flavorings or colorings are used in the process.\\"Ron del Barrilito: Puerto Rico‚Äôs Oldest, Most Beloved Rum\\", \\"Eater\\", February 2016  Packaging  Ron del Barrilito's iconic label has remained virtually unchanged since the late nineteenth century. The medals on the main label's upper segment were awarded for quality during various Expositions across the United States in the early twentieth century. The star-based denomination is another takeaway that Pedro Fern√°ndez learned from French brandy making. It was common practice in France at that time to use stars to show the quality of a particular brandy.  Varieties  The original Ron del Barrilito is known today as Ron del Barrilito Tres Estrellas (‚ÄúThree Stars‚Äù). It is a blend of rums aged between 6 and 10 years.

Founded in 1918 as Jones College,Orlando College, Student Catalog, 1987, Page 1 the school was chartered as a degree-granting institution by the State of Florida, and sought to provide higher education opportunities to the Central Florida region. The college changed its name to Orlando College in 1982 and, after experiencing a decade of growth, closed and was sold to Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (CCi) in 1995. Environment Praised for its sometimes non-traditional educational techniques, classes at the college were relatively small, often holding as few as seven students and no more than twenty-five.Orlando College, Student Catalog, 1993 This was a reflection of the school's guiding philosophy that all students should have as intimate a relationship with one another as the material they were studying. The school's recruitment materials often carried the tagline, \\"A small college can make a big difference\\" as a reflection of its philosophy toward education.Orlando College, Student Catalog, 1988, Cover  Campus  The Orlando College campus was located on Diplomat Circle, north of Lee Road and was visible from Interstate 4. After the school's closure, part of the physical plant was sold off and, after years of neglect, became a shopping center in 2001. The buildings that remain are now part of Florida Metropolitan University. The Orlando College campus consisted of academic and administration buildings. Cafeterias were available in the Diplomat Building. (In addition to its main campus, a small building that acted as an extension of the school's medical program was added, adjacent to Orlando Regional Medical Center, in 1987.) The school offered no student housing and was considered a \\"commuter college\\" though many nearby apartment complexes became unofficial \\"dormitories\\" for Orlando College students.  Curriculum  The college offered undergraduate degrees (associate and bachelor) starting with its accreditation in 1953. In 1987, the college expanded its curriculum to offer graduate degrees. In addition to offering master's degrees, Accounting majors were able to finish their required fifth year of study at the college, in order to qualify for the Florida State Board of Accountancy Examination. Areas of study for associate and bachelor's degrees included Business, Art, Medicine, Film Studies, and Legal. Partner program with Stetson University. Master's degrees were available in Business Administration and Public Administration.  Confusion  In 1980, a controversy that hung over the college for its remaining years began when a small college operating under the name Orlando Christian College, located on Marks Street in the Lake Highland neighborhood, lost its accreditation and was forced to close. The campus of Orlando Christian College later became that of Lake Highland Preparatory School (which has no relation to the defunct Orlando Christian College). This closure resulted in a misperception among the public that Orlando College was granting degrees while lacking accreditation. This resulted in annual statements from the school to students and the press, reassuring all that the school was fully accredited by parties of the United States Office of Education, the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation, and licensed by the Florida State Licensure Board of Independent Colleges and Universities.  Closure  In 1995, the college was sold from the founding Jones family to CCi, at which time the college's focus and curriculum underwent a thorough redesign to make the institution a business school focused on career training. In 1995, the school was renamed Florida Metropolitan University and was merged with other existing for-profit career colleges throughout the state, all carrying the same Florida Metropolitan University brand. The name Orlando College has not been used by any university or college since.

The square is located in the historic centre of Minsk nearby with the museum of the 1st Congress of RSDLP, Main offices of National State TV and Radio and City House of Marriages. A green park stretches from the Victory Square to the river of Svislach and to the entrance to the M. Gorky Park. Victory Square is the key landmark of Minsk. Holiday parades go through the square. The newly married traditionally take their picture at the square. Victory Square is a key landmark for Belarus like Red Square in Moscow for Russia. Transportation: Metro \\"Plo≈°ƒça Pieramohi\\", street car 1,3,4,6,8,10,11 Victory Monument A replica of the Order of Victory crowns a granite column of erected in the centre of the square. The Sacred Sword of Victory is at the base of the monument. The monument was built in 1954 in honour of the soldiers of the Soviet Army and partisans of Belarus. Sculptors: Z. Azgur, A. Bembel, S. Selikhanau. Architects: U. Karol, G. Zagorski. The four facets of the pedestal hold bronze relief thematic images: \\"May 9, 1945\\", \\"Soviet Army during the Great Patriotic War\\", \\"Belarusian Partisans\\", \\"Honour to Heroes who gave their lives for liberation\\". The four bronze wreaths around the obelisk signify the four Fronts. The soldiers of these fronts gave their lives fighting to liberate Belarus from German Fascist invaders. Post #1 Cadets of the Military Academy of Belarus during a guard mounting ceremony. Post #1 at Victory Square refers to guard duty that is carried out by members of the armed forces and among students of general education schools and vocational schools in Minsk. Post #1 was initiated on 3 July 1984, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the liberation of Minsk. The guard of honor serves at Post No. 1 for one week from 9.00 to 17.00 in the cold and from 9.00 to 18.00 in the warm time of the day. The duration of each shift is 10 to 20 minutes. The only breaks in maintaining the honorary were from 15 May to 1 November 1988, from 1 June to 20 November 2003, and from 1 December 2003 to 20 April 2004.http://sch60.minsk.edu.by/ru/main.aspx?guid=53461 History of Construction Buildings around the Victory Square. The red letters on the buildings read \\"Heroic deed of the people is immortal\\". Prior to 1958 the square held a name \\"Kruglaya\\" (Round). Builders led by architect R. Stoler started constructing two round buildings around the square. During the Great Patriotic War the buildings were partially destroyed. R. Stoler returned to Minsk in 1957 to help rebuild these buildings. Before the Great Patriotic War a street car was running on Sovetskaya street through the square. Before the construction of the Victory Monument there was a memorial stone fenced with a chain. Granite Monument of Victory In 1946 the BSSR government opened a competition for design of a Victory Memorial. Initially the site was planned in the vicinity of the current \\"Kastrychnitskaya\\" (October) square. Selected design provided for a monument made of white pink marble. To open the memorial by the 10th anniversary of liberation of Belarus, the design was adjusted to use gray granite and make the column shorter. Ukrainian quarries near Dnepropetrovsk and Zhytomyr provided the granite for construction. Leningrad Academy of Arts crafted the mosaic for the Order of Victory. Ukrainian carvers indented the granite reliefs. Leningrad factory \\"Monumentskulptura\\" cast bronze reliefs, sward and wreaths. On 3 July 1961, on the 17th anniversary of liberation of Minsk, Honourable Citizen of Minsk, Hero of Soviet Union colonel-general Alexei Burdeinei lit the eternal flame at the foundation of the obelisk. In 1984 architects B. Larchenko, B. Shkolnikov, K.Vyazgin re- designed the square from round into oval to fit the exits from metro station. On 1 July 1984 granite blocks were mounted with capsules containing soil from Soviet Hero Cities: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Kiev, Odessa, Sevastopol, Kerch, Novorossiysk, Tula, Brest Fortress. In 1985 capsules with soil from Hero Cities Smolensk and Murmansk were added. Memorial Hall in the pedestrian underpass On 8 May 1985, in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Victory in Great Patriotic War, a Memorial Hall opened in the pedestrian underpass under the Victory Square. The Hall honours the Heroes of Soviet Union who gave their lives to liberate Belarus from Nazi occupation. A circular gallery under the square connects the underpass with the Memorial Hall. Artist V. Pozhyak crafted a highlighted glass wreath in the center of the Hall. A bronze star of Hero of Soviet Union is embedded in the hall's wall. 566 names of natives from Belarus and other Soviet republics are listed on the wall. Those are the people who fought to liberate Belarusian soil and were awarded the title of Hero of Soviet Union for their heroic deeds. The square before the update in 2003 In 2003 the square was slightly updated to improve the monument stability due to damage from metro trains running under it, as well as to replace the grown-up firs with grass lawns.

Lilly Becher (n√©e Korpus, 27 January 1901, Nuremberg, Middle Franconia ‚Äì 20 September 1978, Berlin) was a German writer, journalist, and communist activist. Noted as one of the first anti-Nazi writers to produce documentary work dealing with the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany during the 1930s, Lilly Becher was the wife of noted writer Johannes Becher and achieved significant recognition in East Germany as a writer in her own right. Biography Lilly Becher was born as Lilly Korpus in Nuremberg on January 27, 1901, and studied in Munich and Heidelberg. Joining the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) during the first political climaxes of the post-World War I turmoil in 1919, she began a long career as a political journalist in the 1920s, working for the KPD newspaper Die Rote Fahne in 1921 and organizing a women's section of the Communist Party in 1922-1923. She moved to Vienna in 1933, the year of Hitler's assumption of power in Germany, remaining for a year before moving to work for the √âditions du Carrefour publishing firm in Paris, where she helped publicize and document the plight of German Jews under her homeland's Nazi regime in √âditions du Carrefour's 1936 collection Der Gelbe Fleck: die Ausrottung von 500000 dt. Juden, (The yellow spot: the extinction of 500000 dt. The Jews), one of the first such documentary works on the subject. The book's foreword was written by Lion Feuchtwanger. After meeting and marrying Johannes R. Becher, a revolutionary and fellow refugee from the Nazis in Paris, the two moved to the Soviet Union, living there until 1945. Both joined the National Committee for a Free Germany following the German invasion of the Soviet Union. With Germany's defeat in the Second World War, the Bechers returned to the Soviet occupation zone of the divided Allied- occupied Germany. Lilly Becher worked as head editor of the Neuen Berliner Illustrierten, a major East German weekly magazine, from 1945 until 1950. Johannes Becher composed the lyrics to the German Democratic Republic's national anthem, Auferstanden aus Ruinen, during the same period. Becher completed her husband's biography in 1963, five years after his death in 1958. She won high official recognition by the East German government in the 1960s and 1970s, among them the prestigious East German Banner of Labor (Banner der Arbeit) for outstanding achievement in 1969.

He typically uses non-traditional forms to create politically and socially charged critiques of Colombian issues.  Bibliography  He is a contemporary artist known for using conceptualizations and iconic visuals that often make political commentary about his home country. Since 1970, Caro has built a career that, according to the categorizations of history and criticism, denotes an authentic example of conceptual art in Colombia. Since then, Caro's work has proposed a critical eye on social and political conditions in his country, as to their academic and popularly understood historical connotations. Caro's work is achieved through the implementation of informal procedures in traditional artistic practice, including photocopying, public installations, lectures, posters, and materials related to indigenous cultural practices, such as salt or achiote. The vast majority of his work makes use of text as a tool to communicate strong messages, but instead acquires the paradoxical nuances of a political nature as a means of production and dissemination. One may classify Caro's art as politically charged pop art. In 1998, Caro received the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship. Some of his important works include: Sal (1971), Imperialism is a paper tiger (1972), \\"aquinocabeelarte\\" (art does not fit here) (1972), There is no case (1974), Colombia-Marlboro (1975), Colombia-Coca Cola (1977), Defend your talent (1977), \\"Todo est√° muy Caro\\" (Everything is too expensive) (1978), Homage to Manuel Quintin Lame (1979), Project 500 (1987), Onoto, among others.  Style  Caro\`s unique artistic style took on many forms throughout his career. However several key stylistic concepts have stayed with him throughout the years. One being Caro\`s use of unusual materials. Ranging from metal, cardstock, salt and poster board Caro\`s choice in material has never been that of traditional art. Likewise Caro has been a strong advocate against traditional art forms and throughout his career found ways to stray away from the typical. Lastly Caro\`s most unique stylistic characteristic is his passion for creating art with a social or political message. Nearly all of Caro\`s works are a political or social critique regarding what he believes to be important global and strictly Colombian issues  Early Career  Caro first became interested in art at the age of 16, while still in high school. He attributed his early interest in art to two specific pieces the Tributo de los Artistas Colombians a Dante [A Tribute by Colombian Artists to Dante] and Espacios Ambientales [Environmental Spaces]. Caro personally regarded these artworks as crucial to the formation of his style as an artist because they both conveyed concise conceptual messages, important to certain social and political topics. As a result of Caro\`s new found passion he decided to admit himself into the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogota as a Fine Art student shortly after completing high school. However, despite his intense passion for art he dropped out the university, attributing his lack of academic success to his inability to complete the general curriculum. Despite this, his time at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia brought him closer to political movements that he was interested in as well as brought him an influential mentor, Bernado Salcedo. According to Caro, Salcedo was his most influential role model. Together they became pivotal founders in the Colombian conceptual art movement. Salcedo introduced Caro to text based art in the late 1960s inspiring him to create SAL. A text based piece of the word sal [Spanish for salt] made from salt. The work was presented in Cali, at the Primera Bienal Americana de Artes Gr√°ficas in 1971. SAL was one of the first of its kind in Colombia and naturally it aroused critics who claimed artwork lacked a standing in traditional forms. The criticism brought on Caro and Salcedo in the early 1970s inspired them to produce more idea based works rooted in Colombian social issues. As a result, the movement Caro and Salcedo had established in Colombia began to grow apart from conceptual art movements of the same time period in other Latin American countries. Formative Period Artworks Cabeza de Lleras Presented in October 1970 at the XXI Sal√≥n Nacional de Artistas that took place at the Museo Nacional in Bogot√°. The piece is typicb (1966‚Äì70). The work is a bust made from salt that is seen wearing a pair of glasses encased in a glass container on a pedestal. Watee gallery floor to symbolize a denunciatory act on the hegemonic values of society. The result created by the artwork prompted journalist Alegre Levy to state ‚Äú¬°Se inund√≥ el salon!‚Äù [The Salon Flooded!] in her article in Bogot√°‚Äôs major daily newspaper El Tiempo. A saying which has stuck with the piece ever since. Interpretation of Cabeza de Lleras During the 1960s into the late 1970s Colombian political group El Frente Nacional took power over the Conservative and Liberal Parties of Colombia. The group claimed to be a unifying force between the opposing interests which had devastated the country in the previous decades. El Frente Nacional however proved to be an oligarchy made from important business interests and Catholic Church authorities. The group had essentially filled the vacuum of power left being by the warring Conservatives and Liberals of Colombia and instead established their own tyrannical state under a pretext of democracy. Caro\`s work captures a representation of one of the early presidents of the group, Carlos Lleras Restrepo. Cabeza de Lleras was made to capture both the insufficiencies and weaknesses of the political hierarchy Lleras represented as well as the cultural destruction and undermining that was beginning to take place. The salt which makes up the bust of Lleras represented both the weakness of the current government according to Caro as well as the cultural traditions of the Chibcha indigenous civilization. In the original title, Homenaje tard√≠o de sus amigos y amigas de Zipaquir√°, Manaure y Galerazamba [Late Homage From his Friends of Zipaquir√°, Manaure and Galerazamba] the three cities mentioned Zipaquir√°, Manaure and Galerazamba are Colombian cities known for their ancient salt mining industries. Furthermore, the water poured into the venue according to Caro established the ever-present waters of history which were to eventually dissolve the tyrannical hierarchy of oppression and along with it the cultural backbone of Colombia. Aqui no cabe el Arte First presented at the XXIII Sal√≥n de Artistas Nacionales (1972) in Bogot√°, Aqui no cabe el Arte [Art Does Not Fit Here] by Caro was the only text based art of its kind among the forty four other works presented at the time. The piece was made of sixteen white poster boards with a sharp, and angular letter written in bold in the center of each poster. Each letter was placed side by side and together measured eleven meters in length. Underneath each poster lies the name of a victim killed by tyrannical governmental forces in Colombia, mainly El Frente. Caro is attempting to use the power of written words to bring attention to political injustice. Interpretation of Aqui no cabe el Arte Caro\`s piece Aqui no cabe el Arte comes in the wake of the election of Misael Pastrana Borrero as Colombia\`s President. After taking office in 1970, Borrero began instituting martial law, and as a result began to suppress civil liberties. Forceful action used against organized political strikes as well as the elimination of popular local leaders became increasingly numerous during Borrero\`s term. As a result of the political atmosphere in Colombia, Caro created the work to highlight the many atrocities being committed at the time. some of the most well known events include the murder of university student, Romulo Carvahlo during the presidency of Carlos Lleras Restrepo. Carvahlo\`s death is described by Caro to be an antecedent for the massacre of students after an organized insurrection during Borrero\`s term as president. Furthermore, also mentioned in the work is the brutal massacre of Guahibo indigenous peoples in Colombia\`s Planas region. Among others, these two events struck Caro as noteworthy for people to bring their attention too and as a result were a big reason behind the creation of the piece. El imperialismo es un tigre de papel Originally exhibited in 1973 at the Nombres nuevos en el arte de Colombia [New Names in the Art of Colombia] El imperialismo es un tigre de papel [Imperialism is a Paper Tiger] was the recreation of Mao Tse Tung‚Äôs famous expression ‚ÄúImperialism is a Paper Tiger.‚Äù The work is a red banner made of silk, typically used in protests. Painted on the banner were large white letters, forming Mao\`s famous statement. Additionally, on each side of the banner Caro placed a total of twelve silhouette tigers to effectively use environmental spaces at the exhibit. The action of setting up the individual tigers was captured in a famous photograph taken of the work by reporters at La Republica. Interpretation of El imperialismo es un tigre de papel Caro\`s reinstatement of Mao\`s saying was created to bring light to the influence of Mao\`s Little Red book to the establishing of new ideas among young Colombians. As said by Caro ‚ÄúThe phrase came to me by inertia, through the context. What I did was convert the phrase into a palpable thing.‚Äù While still fresh from the creation of Aqui no cabe el Arte, Caro wanted to use the momentum of his previous success to reenacted a political critique while bringing in new ideas he had felt were politically relevant. Colombia-Marlboro In 1973 Caro began the Marlboro project aimed at criticizing growing consumerism in Colombia. The Colombia-Marlboro project refers to a number of distinct pieces that are redesigns of Marlboro\`s trademark logo with \\"Colombia\\" put in place of Marlboro. One of the most widely known pieces of this project was presented by Caro at Agudelo‚Äôs gallery and was made from white cardstock and red tissue paper. Underneath the piece hung a series of flags with the Marlboro design as well as Caro\`s name put in place of the word Marlboro. Interpretation of Colombia-Marlboro The purpose of Caro\`s project was to highlight the growing consumer mentality he was beginning to see expand in Colombia. In order to do so he wanted to use the advertising system against major industrial powers. Although the project seemingly addresses smokers, the actual intent of the work was pertaining to a larger globalization movement that Caro was passionate about. In a statement about the project Caro describes some of the main ideas he wished to bring to light > \\"I am not a sociologist, nor a historian, nor any of those things, but I am > a myopic; this allows me to see many things from reality like for instance, > that in that epoch there were a lot of people selling Marlboro on the > street. From there came the proposal that consisted in fusing the design of > Marlboro and the word Colombia.\\" Colombia-Coca-Cola Originally shown at the Lapiz y Papel exhibition by Jonier Mar√≠n in 1976. The work was a graphite drawing resembling the famous Coca-Cola style logo but in place of the Coca-Cola name was written ‚ÄúColombia‚Äù in the same font. Later that same year Caro recreated the artwork and presented it to the XXVI Sal√≥n Nacional de Artistas. This time the piece was made from metal to better resemble Coca-Cola advertising signs. Furthermore, Colombia was painted onto the metal rather than drawn. Interpretation of Colombia-Coca-Cola Similarly to the context behind Colombia-Marlboro. Caro wanted to highlight the growing consumerism in Colombia that he felt was bringing forth capitalist and imperialist pressures on Colombian identity. Due to the positive feedback he had received after the Marlboro Project, Caro decided to continue the use of advertisement manipulation in order to further the spread of his ideas. Similar works were also taking place in nearby Latin American countries such as Brazil. Although it is not known whether Cildo Meireles' Coca-Cola Project in 1970 had any effect on Caro, the similarities are helpful in understanding the greater context for advertisement based pieces. Caro's overarching desire for the piece was for it to be a symbol of the ‚ÄúAmericanization‚Äù of Colombian industry. Caro at the time felt as if the Colombian government had essentially sold itself to the hands of American industrial giants such as Coca-Cola.

Lannai received section patrol number 242, indicating that she was a privately owned motorboat which the U.S. Navy sometime between 1916 and 1918 at least considered for World War I service as a patrol vessel.

The spectacle drew large interest, and brought visitors from all over the region to watch. The Governor attended, and before the hatch was released, Simmons made a confession and plea for mercy. The crowd was moved, embarrassed that they had made entertainment out the incident, but the Governor refused clemency and Simmons was hanged. In 1846, the state abolished the death penalty, with the Simmons case playing a key role.

It is a seven-acre (2.8 ha) parcel with two brick buildings on it. In the 1880s it became the thriving resort city's first power station. They are the only remnants of a gas-fired power plant begun in 1873 and remaining in operation for over half a century. One of the two buildings is a rare conical-roofed gas holder house from that era, one of only 13 left in the Northeast, and archaeological evidence shows evidence of a second one having been built nearby. The gas production operations were taken offline in 1928, but the property continued to be used by electric utilities for most of the 20th century. In 1992 Niagara Mohawk decided it was surplus and stopped using it. In 2001 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property The power plant site is an irregular trapezoid-shaped parcel between East Avenue on the east, Excelsior Avenue to the south and a divided section of US 9/NY 50 along its north. The land drops slightly from that road, and trees planted along that side screen the site from passing traffic. All around it is a chain link fence. Within the fence the entire site is surfaced in loose gravel and devoid of trees. The two buildings are located in different sections of the parcel. The gasholder house is at the northern corner, close to the junction of East Avenue and routes 9 and 50. It is a cylindrical brick building in common bond in diameter with a conical slate roof. It has no foundation but the 18-inch‚Äìthick (46 cm) walls continue to depth of below grade, where they are grounded in a clay stratus. There are also six exterior brick buttresses. Old gas holder as photographed for Historic American Engineering Record in 1998 Its roof is supported by radial wood rafters with wood purlins and two transverse bow trusses. The floor is poured concrete. Windows, a vent and service exit were added later. The substation building is located to the south, close to that side and north of the only gate in the fence. It is a two-story rectangular brick building, , on an east-west axis with a cross-gabled roof. Its foundation is stone laid in a random ashlar pattern. Pilasters divide the walls into recessed panels (7 by 3), and a corbeled cornice marks the roofline. A large oculus is in the tympanum of each gable. In the middle of the south side is a taller arched entrance with service door and the remains of a hoist. It leads to an interior with an open interior, floored in poured concrete supported by steel beams. Two stone walls run along the inside, the beams resting on them. Brick buttresses shore up the steel I-beams that supported the hoist. V-trusses sheathed in tongue-and-groove pocket into the interior walls, producing the eaves. The only interior partitition separates the easternmost bay. On that side of the building, outside, are modern transformers and other equipment. Though no longer in use, they are of relatively recent date and are not considered a contributing resource to the Register listing. As a result of required studies done when the building and site were remediated, considerable archeological evidence has been found of other buildings in the site. The entire site is thus considered a contributing resource. History The Saratoga Gas Light Company began providing service to the Village of Saratoga Springs in 1853. As the community grew after the American Civil War, its infrastructure needs did as well. The company needed to build a new gas works, and chose the current location due in part to concerns about locating such a facility near downtown. The site had other advantages as well. It was close to the railroad line (now routes 9 and 50), had a nearby stream, Village Brook, which could provide sufficient water, and the deep clay layer would provide an impermeable seal below the gas holders. Because of the proximity of the brook, the site was lower than the rest of the city, and therefore it would be easier to distribute the gas as it naturally tends to rise in pipes. The new plant was started in 1873 and opened the next year. At the original plant it had made gas by coking coal in a horizontal retort and then capturing and storing the gas that was released. The new plant encased a brick retort, purifying house and two gas holders within the cylindrical buildings. The thick walls helped prevent the gas from condensing in the cold winters, and the conical roof accommodated the gasholder, a telescoping series of cylinders that rose within guides as the volume of gas increased. Water in the bottom of the pit made the seal impermeable. In 1886 the company, which had dropped the \\"Light\\" from its name, began using the carbureted water gas process to manufacture gas. This increased its production efficiency and volume, and required the addition of more buildings ‚Äî a boiler house, oil and coal storage and more gasholders. The following year the company merged with the American Illuminating Company to become the Saratoga Gas, Electric Light and Power Company. A dynamo on the site provided electricity for the city's street lights. In 1903 the electricity-generation facilities were further expanded. The substation, a steam boiler and smokestack were added. Power generation continued for eight years, until 1911, when yet another merger created the Hudson River Water Power Company. It built a regional power distribution system to carry the power generated by its dams all over the southern Adirondack region. With the cheaper hydroelectric power available, and industrial customers willing to use it in large quantities, it was no longer economical to generate power in Saratoga Springs. The original gasholder was removed from the first building in 1919. Coal gas production ceased entirely in 1928, and most of the original buildings were demolished in the years afterwards. The substation building remained in use, and the successor utilities also used the area as a storage and maintenance yard until Niagara Mohawk decided it was no longer needed even for those purposes. The utility still owns the land and buildings, and keeps them fenced off. The property underwent environmental cleanup ordered in 1995. The gasholder was originally slated for demolition but was eventually moved intact to its present location at the northwest corner of the site.

Definition Under the regulatory mechanisms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, wireless, and long-distance carriers, such as AT&T;, Sprint, T-Mobile US, and Verizon, pay access fees to local exchange carriers (LECs) for calls to those carriers' subscribers. The FCC permits rural carriers to charge substantially higher access fees than carriers in urban areas, based on the rationale that they must pay for substantial fixed infrastructure costs while handling lower call volume. To increase the incoming call volume to those rural areas, and thereby fees earned, rural carriers partner with certain telephone service providers to route their calls through the rural carrier. These services typically include phone sex and conference call providers, which expect a high volume of incoming calls. Notably, these service providers do not need to establish a physical, local presence for routing these calls. As a consequence of this arrangement, the rural carriers can receive millions of dollars of fees, which they share with the service providers. Payment for inbound long-distance calls to small rural telephone companies is normally handled through a shared pool, the National Exchange Carrier Association (\\"NECA\\"). Individual telcos are free to opt out of this process. For the first two years, they may bill interexchange carriers directly at an initially-high rural rate of five to thirteen cents per minute. After two years the carrier either rejoins the NECA pool, provides evidence to support continuing to charge the high rural rate or reduces rates to a level that can be supported.. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2014-06-15. A sudden increase in inbound calling volume at about the same time as a telephone company leaves the NECA pool therefore can represent profitable two years for that firm. The numbers used for the service belong to a competitive local exchange carrier or independent telephone company and may be located in a rural numbering plan area in a sparsely-populated state, such as area code 218 in northern Minnesota or area code 712 in western Iowa.is one example of a conference bridge using +1-218 Minnesota and +1-712 Iowa extensively. Voice over IP In 2006, various startup companies began to offer voice over IP or Internet fax services which purported to be \\"free\\"; these operated from Iowa or used Iowa local numbers. One such service, invited users to call a number in Iowa's area code 641 to reach a voice-over-Internet gateway from which calls could be made to China (country code +86) at no additional cost.

By 2008, the offer of a free Iowa number for inbound Internet voice and fax calls had also been withdrawn. As of 2014, IPKall offered \\"free\\" Washington (state) numbers to voice over IP subscribers anywhere on the Internet, but chose to discontinue services after May 1, 2016. Consequences End-users of traffic-pumped phone services often do not pay directly for the high fees collected by rural local carriers and service providers. Many wireless and land line customers now have unlimited long- distance plans, and thus the entire inflated cost of using these services is borne by their long-distance carrier. Providers of traffic-pumped conference calling services assert that these long-distance carriers still profit when their customers use traffic-pumped services. In 2007, AT&T; estimated that it would spend an additional $250 million to connect such calls, and has warned that it may have to raise its customers' calling plan prices unless regulators address the issue of traffic pumping. However, providers of traffic-pumped conference calls claim that AT&T; has refused to provide evidence of these costs, and that it is a ploy by AT&T; to leverage its market power to put competing conference calling providers out of business. AT&T; and other long- distance carriers have in some cases attempted to avoid these costs by blocking their customers from calling the phone numbers of traffic-pumping services. However, the FCC has forbidden common carriers from this kind of selective blocking, and so the long-distance carriers are essentially obligated to complete these calls. Based upon an independent study of 50% of long-distance calls originating on wireless networks in the U.S., calls terminating to carriers meeting a traffic pumping profile were estimated to cost $95 million annually, representing 11% of all long-distance costs in the study. Extending to all wireless service providers, the cost is estimated to be more than $190 million annually.  Role in dispute between AT&T; and Google  The Google Voice telecommunications service offers a service similar to long-distance telephone calling at no cost, using VoIP to connect users with their calling destinations. In order to avoid paying high connection fees to traffic-pumping carriers, Google Voice blocked calls to some of these carriers. , Google Voice no longer blocks calls to these carriers, but charges its users a fee to reach them (while not charging for other calls to US phone numbers).Explanation on Google Product Forums AT&T; has appealed to the FCC to intervene, charging that Google Voice ought to be required to connect these calls just as plain old telephone service (POTS) carriers are required to do so. Google has responded that its service, and those of VoIP providers such as Skype, is distinct from those of a traditional POTS common carrier, and that it should not be obligated to complete these calls. Google further charges that AT&T; is trying to distract the FCC from concerns regarding network neutrality, and accuses AT&T; of conducting regulatory capitalism, in which businesses exploit laws and regulations to stifle competition and slow innovation. Finally, Google urges the FCC to revise \\"outdated carrier compensation rules\\" to end the practice of traffic pumping. AT&T; has written to the FCC, stating that Google's blocking of calls to traffic pumping numbers gives it a substantial cost advantage over traditional carriers. AT&T; further argued that the issue of network neutrality is highly relevant, since Google is violating its own statement of the principle of non-discrimination, that \\"a provider 'cannot block fair access' to another provider.\\" AT&T; agrees with Google that the FCC should act to forbid traffic pumping schemes in the first place, calling them \\"patently unlawful\\", but asks that Google be required to accept the same common carrier requirements even if they are not shut down. A bipartisan group of U.S. Representatives has joined in AT&T;'s complaint, urging the FCC to investigate Google Voice's practice of blocking calls to high-fee rural local exchange carriers. Some of these legislators have received significant campaign contributions from AT&T;, and represent districts where rural carriers profit from traffic pumping. Sam Gustin of DailyFinance suggests that there may be issues of conflict of interest and pork barrel politics involved in these legislators' efforts.  Legal rulings   State administrative commission rulings  The Iowa Utilities Board issued its final order in 2009 in a complaint proceeding brought by Qwest and intervened by AT&T; and Sprint Nextel against eight rural telephone companies in Iowa. Except for one call blocking finding against Sprint, the decision was unfavorable for the rural carriers, which may have to return the fees they received for calls directed to traffic-pumped services by Iowa residents. However, damages have not yet been assessed and the Iowa Utilities Board does not have jurisdiction over the vast majority of disputed calls--those that were directed to Iowa from callers in other states--so the reach of its decision is limited. Moreover, the Board has indicated that it is reconsidering its decision and several appeals have been filed challenging the lawfulness of the Board's order, thus it is not yet a final decision. The FCC subsequently issued a ruling in 2009 on this case.  Federal Communications Commission administrative rulings  In 1996, AT&T; filed a Section 208 complaint with the FCC against Jefferson Telephone Company, a rural incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) based in Iowa, which entered into a commercial agreement with a chat line provider.AT&T; Corp. v. Jefferson Tel. Co., 16 FCC Rcd. 16130 (2001) AT&T;'s complaint alleged that Jefferson violated Section 201(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 because it \\"acquired a direct interest in promoting the delivery of calls to specific telephone numbers.\\" AT&T; also argued that the access revenue-sharing arrangement with the chat-line provider was unreasonably discriminatory in violation of Section 202(a) of the Act, because Jefferson did not share revenues with all its customers. The FCC rejected both these arguments and denied AT&T;'s complaint. In 2002, the FCC issued two more orders, denying similar complaints by AT&T; directed at LECs that shared access revenues with chat-line providers. In AT&T; v. Frontier Communications, the Commission rejected AT&T;'s allegations that \\"revenue-sharing arrangements\\" constituted unreasonable discrimination in violation of Section 202(a) or violations of the ILECs' common carrier duties under Section 201(b).AT&T; Corp. v. Frontier Commcn's of Mt. Pulaski, Inc., 17 FCC Rcd. Rcd. 4041-42, ¬∂¬∂ 1, 2 (2002). In AT&T; v. Beehive Telephone, the FCC again denied AT&T;'s complaint against a LEC that engaged in a commercial relationship with a chat-line provider for the same reasons.AT&T; v. Beehive Tel. Co., 17 FCC Rcd. Rcd. 11641 (2002). The FCC has more recently issued an order in a case involving an Iowa carrier relating to interstate calls (calls made from any state other than Iowa to an Iowa telephone number). In that order, the FCC determined that the Iowa carrier was not entitled to collect the entire amounts it billed to a long- distance carrier, but that it was nevertheless entitled to some compensation. The exact amount of payment has not yet been fixed by the FCC.  Court rulings  Cases remain pending in several courts across the country, including federal courts in Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Kentucky, and New York. Several courts have recently asked the FCC for additional guidance on determining the appropriate rate that should be paid by the long- distance carriers for calls directed to traffic-pumped services, calling it an area of regulation \\"in dynamic flux.\\"All Am.

AT&T;, Inc., 07 Civ. 861 (WHP), Docket 88 (Jan. 19, 2010)  State legislation  Several long-distance carriers lobbied the South Dakota legislature to propose legislation forbidding rural telephone carriers from entering into revenue- sharing agreements with traffic-pumped services.

There are an infinite number of these, but those of most interest are simpler ones that model some aspect of the environment. Of particular interest is six-dimensional Euclidean space, in which 6-polytopes and the 5-sphere are constructed. Six-dimensional elliptical space and hyperbolic spaces are also studied, with constant positive and negative curvature. Formally, six-dimensional Euclidean space, ‚Ñù6, is generated by considering all real 6-tuples as 6-vectors in this space. As such it has the properties of all Euclidean spaces, so it is linear, has a metric and a full set of vector operations. In particular the dot product between two 6-vectors is readily defined and can be used to calculate the metric. 6 √ó 6 matrices can be used to describe transformations such as rotations that keep the origin fixed. More generally, any space that can be described locally with six coordinates, not necessarily Euclidean ones, is six-dimensional. One example is the surface of the 6-sphere, S6. This is the set of all points in seven- dimensional space (Euclidean) ‚Ñù7 that are a fixed distance from the origin. This constraint reduces the number of coordinates needed to describe a point on the 6-sphere by one, so it has six dimensions. Such non-Euclidean spaces are far more common than Euclidean spaces, and in six dimensions they have far more applications. Geometry 6-polytope A polytope in six dimensions is called a 6-polytope. The most studied are the regular polytopes, of which there are only three in six dimensions: the 6-simplex, 6-cube, and 6-orthoplex. A wider family are the uniform 6-polytopes, constructed from fundamental symmetry domains of reflection, each domain defined by a Coxeter group. Each uniform polytope is defined by a ringed Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. The 6-demicube is a unique polytope from the D6 family, and 221 and 122 polytopes from the E6 family. {class=wikitable |+ Uniform polytopes in six dimensions (Displayed as orthogonal projections in each Coxeter plane of symmetry) |- !A6 !colspan=2|B6 !D6 !colspan=2|E6 |- align=center |120px 6-simplex {3,3,3,3,3} |120px 6-cube {4,3,3,3,3} |120px 6-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,4} |120px 6-demicube = {3,33,1} = h{4,3,3,3,3} |120px 221 = {3,3,32,1} |120px 122 = {3,32,2} |} 5-sphere The 5-sphere, or hypersphere in six dimensions, is the five-dimensional surface equidistant from a point.

Applications Transformations in three dimensions In three dimensional space a rigid transformation has six degrees of freedom, three translations along the three coordinate axes and three from the rotation group SO(3). Often these transformations are handled separately as they have very different geometrical structures, but there are ways of dealing with them that treat them as a single six-dimensional object. Screw theory In screw theory angular and linear velocity are combined into one six-dimensional object, called a twist. A similar object called a wrench combines forces and torques in six dimensions. These can be treated as six-dimensional vectors that transform linearly when changing frame of reference. Translations and rotations cannot be done this way, but are related to a twist by exponentiation. Phase space Phase portrait of the Van der Pol oscillator Phase space is a space made up of the position and momentum of a particle, which can be plotted together in a phase diagram to highlight the relationship between the quantities. A general particle moving in three dimensions has a phase space with six dimensions, too many to plot but they can be analysed mathematically. Rotations in four dimensions The rotation group in four dimensions, SO(4), has six degrees of freedom. This can be seen by considering the 4 √ó 4 matrix that represents a rotation: as it is an orthogonal matrix the matrix is determined, up to a change in sign, by e.g. the six elements above the main diagonal. But this group is not linear, and it has a more complex structure than other applications seen so far. Another way of looking at this group is with quaternion multiplication. Every rotation in four dimensions can be achieved by multiplying by a pair of unit quaternions, one before and one after the vector. These quaternion are unique, up to a change in sign for both of them, and generate all rotations when used this way, so the product of their groups, S3 √ó S3, is a double cover of SO(4), which must have six dimensions. Although the space we live in is considered three-dimensional, there are practical applications for four-dimensional space. Quaternions, one of the ways to describe rotations in three dimensions, consist of a four- dimensional space. Rotations between quaternions, for interpolation, for example, take place in four dimensions. Spacetime, which has three space dimensions and one time dimension is also four-dimensional, though with a different structure to Euclidean space. Electromagnetism In electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field is generally thought of as being made of two things, the electric field and magnetic field. They are both three-dimensional vector fields, related to each other by Maxwell's equations. A second approach is to combine them in a single object, the six-dimensional electromagnetic tensor, a tensor or bivector valued representation of the electromagnetic field. Using this Maxwell's equations can be condensed from four equations into a particularly compact single equation: : \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathbf{J} \\\\, where is the bivector form of the electromagnetic tensor, is the four-current and is a suitable differential operator.Lounesto (2001), pp. 109‚Äì110 String theory Calabi-Yau manifold (3D projection) In physics string theory is an attempt to describe general relativity and quantum mechanics with a single mathematical model. Although it is an attempt to model our universe it takes place in a space with more dimensions than the four of spacetime that we are familiar with. In particular a number of string theories take place in a ten-dimensional space, adding an extra six dimensions. These extra dimensions are required by the theory, but as they cannot be observed are thought to be quite different, perhaps compactified to form a six- dimensional space with a particular geometry too small to be observable. Since 1997 another string theory has come to light that works in six dimensions. Little string theories are non-gravitational string theories in five and six dimensions that arise when considering limits of ten-dimensional string theory.Aharony (2000) Theoretical background Bivectors in four dimensions A number of the above applications can be related to each other algebraically by considering the real, six-dimensional bivectors in four dimensions. These can be written Œõ2‚Ñù4 for the set of bivectors in Euclidean space or Œõ2‚Ñù3,1 for the set of bivectors in spacetime. The Pl√ºcker coordinates are bivectors in ‚Ñù4 while the electromagnetic tensor discussed in the previous section is a bivector in ‚Ñù3,1. Bivectors can be used to generate rotations in either ‚Ñù4 or ‚Ñù3,1 through the exponential map (e.g. applying the exponential map of all bivectors in Œõ2‚Ñù4 generates all rotations in ‚Ñù4). They can also be related to general transformations in three dimensions through homogeneous coordinates, which can be thought of as modified rotations in ‚Ñù4. The bivectors arise from sums of all possible wedge products between pairs of 4-vectors. They therefore have C = 6 components, and can be written most generally as : \\\\mathbf{B} = B_{12}\\\\mathbf{e}_{12} + B_{13}\\\\mathbf{e}_{13} + B_{14}\\\\mathbf{e}_{14} + B_{23}\\\\mathbf{e}_{23} + B_{24}\\\\mathbf{e}_{24} + B_{34}\\\\mathbf{e}_{34} They are the first bivectors that cannot all be generated by products of pairs of vectors. Those that can are simple bivectors and the rotations they generate are simple rotations. Other rotations in four dimensions are double and isoclinic rotations and correspond to non-simple bivectors that cannot be generated by single wedge product.Lounesto (2001), pp. 86-89 6-vectors 6-vectors are simply the vectors of six-dimensional Euclidean space. Like other such vectors they are linear, can be added subtracted and scaled like in other dimensions. Rather than use letters of the alphabet, higher dimensions usually use suffixes to designate dimensions, so a general six-dimensional vector can be written . Written like this the six basis vectors are , , , , and . Of the vector operators the cross product cannot be used in six dimensions; instead, the wedge product of two 6-vectors results in a bivector with 15 dimensions. The dot product of two vectors is :\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 + a_4b_4 + a_5b_5 + a_6b_6. It can be used to find the angle between two vectors and the norm, :\\\\left \\\\mathbf{a} \\\\right \\\\vert = \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}} = \\\\sqrt{{a_1}^2 + {a_2}^2 + {a_3}^2 + {a_4}^2 + {a_5}^2 + {a_6}^2}. This can be used for example to calculate the diagonal of a 6-cube; with one corner at the origin, edges aligned to the axes and side length 1 the opposite corner could be at , the norm of which is :\\\\sqrt{1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +1} = \\\\sqrt{6} = 2.4495, which is the length of the vector and so of the diagonal of the 6-cube. Gibbs bivectors In 1901 J.W. Gibbs published a work on vectors that included a six-dimensional quantity he called a bivector. It consisted of two three-dimensional vectors in a single object, which he used to describe ellipses in three dimensions. It has fallen out of use as other techniques have been developed, and the name bivector is now more closely associated with geometric algebra.

Biography Edwin Byrne was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Francis Charles and Anna (n√©e Carroll) Byrne. After graduating from Roman Catholic High School for Boys in Philadelphia in 1908, he studied at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Edmond Francis Prendergast on May 22, 1915. He then served as a curate at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Philadelphia until 1917, when he became a chaplain in the United States Navy during World War I. From 1920 to 1923, he was secretary to Bishop James Paul McCloskey, of the Diocese of Jaro in the Philippines. He was named vicar general of Jaro in 1923. On June 23, 1925, Byrne was appointed the first Bishop of the Diocese of Ponce in Puerto Rico by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 30 from Cardinal Dennis Joseph Dougherty, with Bishop John Joseph Swint and Bishop Andrew James Louis Brennan serving as co-consecrators. After Archbishop Jorge Jos√© Caruana was made Apostolic Nuncio to Mexico, Byrne was named Bishop of San Juan on March 8, 1929. He became an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1940. Byrne was appointed the eighth Archbishop of Santa Fe, New Mexico, on June 12, 1943. During his 20-year-long tenure, he was instrumental in the construction of many churches and schools, and built up the diocesan clergy. In 1958, his decree that no Catholic girl should appear in a bathing suit in the Miss New Mexico pageant received national attention and stirred controversy; he never rescinded the ban. He condemned a \\"right to work\\" bill being considered in the state legislature. He also prohibited Catholic students from dating while attending high school, describing \\"going steady, keeping steady company, necking and kissing\\" as \\"pagan\\" practices. He attended the first session of the Second Vatican Council in 1962. Byrne suffered a gallbladder attack on July 21, 1963, and was admitted to St. Vincent Hospital two days later.

This coastal rock covers approximately , and rises steeply above sea level. The refuge provides an important sanctuary for the Aleutian cackling goose and nesting seabirds. History Tolowa people foraged on, but did not live on the island, their village sites were on the headlands near Castle Rock and towards Point St. George where the intertidal zone provided shellfish and seaweed. Tolowa Indian Settlements are California Registered Historical Landmark No. 649 The Tolowa hunted sea lions from to long sea-going canoes at St. George Reef and Castle Rock. They also hunted and ate sea otters, sea lions, whales, harbor and fur seals as well as birds, eggs and juvenile birds with the most common midden bird bones being from immature cormorants. In May, men would collect eggs to be eaten as well as blown empty and used to make decorative garlands. There are no known archaeological sites on the island. White settlement in 1850 was followed by decimation of natives; only about 300 were still alive six years later. The island was claimed by the U.S. Government at the end of the 1800s, but from 1900 to 1920, it was being grazed by a private sheepherder with a cabin constructed for his use. Egg collectors and oologists visited from around 1917 to the 1960s. Private owners who planned to quarry rock for harbors and jetties bought Castle Rock from the U.S. Government in 1937. They also considered mining guano or building a tourist attraction on the island. The island was proposed for protection following the rediscovery of the Aleutian cackling goose, which was thought to be extinct but was found to be using the island in the spring of 1975. At that time, the entire population of the species used the areas as a spring staging ground for their northward migrations. Castle Rock remained in private ownership until 1979, when the United States Fish and Wildlife Service purchased it from The Nature Conservancy to conserve habitat for marine mammals and seabirds. Castle Rock refuge is not open to the public to prevent disturbance to the marine mammals and sea birds. It may be viewed, and birds seen with spotting scope from the interpretive panel overlook on Pebble Beach Drive south of Washington Boulevard in Crescent City, California. Castle Rock Refuge is managed as a component of the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge Complex from headquarters in Loleta, California (located south of Eureka). Geology Castle Rock is assigned to be part of the Franciscan Assemblage with a base of pillow basalt rising on the west while the eastern end is composed of shale and greywacke. Late Pleistocene soil and a sandy subsoils up to are present on flatter areas, covered by a dark humus which can range to thick. Wave erosion of north to south trending faults have produced large sea caves on the south side of the island, and the \\"pit\\" on the eastern side is not a product of quarrying but was created when a fault collapsed connecting to the ocean under an arch of remaining land. Prevailing ocean currents flow from north to south and prevailing winds from the northwest. Wildlife Castle Rock is the second largest nesting seabird colony south of Alaska (after the Farallon Islands), is a nationally significant sea bird colony and one of only two island National Wildlife Refuges in offshore California; the other is Southeast Farallon Island. As many as 150,000 seabirds are estimated to use Castle Rock, which has the largest breeding population of common murres on the Pacific Coast, with population estimates ranging as high as 100,000 for just this one species. Eleven species of seabirds, one shorebird (the black oystercatcher) and two pinnipeds are documented to breed on Castle Rock. Castle Rock is the northernmost breeding colony of northern elephant seals, which like harbor seals breed on the island; California sea lions and Steller sea lions use the island as a haul-out but do not breed there. Harbor porpoises and gray whales are the most common cetaceans year round, with most sightings of the grey whales during their migration when they feed around Castle Rock. Mostly nocturnal, burrow and crevice nesting sea birds including tufted puffins, fork-tailed storm petrels, and Leach's storm petrels, Cassin's auklets, rhinoceros auklets, double-crested cormorant, Brandt's cormorant, pelagic cormorant and pigeon guillemots avoid predation by the diurnal western gulls which also breed on the island. April and May are prime months to see tufted puffins on the island. Peregrine falcons used to breed on the site but have not been documented since the 1940s. U.S. Endangered Species Act protected brown pelicans use the island as a communal roost but do not breed north of Monterey, California. Over 21,000 Aleutian cackling geese roost on the island, flying at dawn to feed on nearby agricultural lands and returning to the island in the evening.

The Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul have a significant history of settlement, trade, cultural influence, and armed conflict in the Celtic territory of Gaul (modern France), starting from the 6th century BC during the Greek Archaic period. Following the founding of the major trading post of Massalia in 600 BC by the Phocaeans at present day Marseille, Massalians had a complex history of interaction with peoples of the region.  Massalia  Remains of the Greek harbour in the Jardin des Vestiges in central Marseille, the most extensive Greek settlement in pre-Roman Gaul The oldest city of modern France, Marseille, was founded around 600 BC by Greeks from the Asia Minor city of Phocaea (as mentioned by Thucydides Bk1,13, Strabo, Athenaeus and Justin) as a trading post or emporion () under the name ŒúŒ±œÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒØŒ± (Massalia).The Cambridge ancient history p.754A history of ancient Greece Claude Orrieux p.62 A foundation myth reported by Aristotle in the 4th century BC, as well as by Latin authors, recounts how the Phocaean Protis (son of Euxenus) married Gyptis (or Petta), the daughter of a local Segobriges king named Nannus, thus giving him the right to receive a piece of land where he was able to found a city.The Celts: a history by Raithi O Hogain, p.27A Companion to the Classical Greek World Konrad H.

In legend, Gyptis, daughter of the king of the Segobriges, chose the Greek Protis, who then received a site for founding Massalia. Before the Greeks came to pre-eminence in the Gulf of Lion, trade was mainly handled by Etruscans and Carthaginians. The Greeks of Massalia had recurrent conflicts with Gauls and Ligurians of the region,Archaeologies of Colonialism: Consumption, Entanglement, and Violence in Ancient Mediterranean France by Michael Dietler, 2010, p.157-182 and engaged in naval battles against Carthaginians in the late 6th century (Thucydides 1.13) and probably in 490 BC, and soon entered into a treaty with Rome. According to Charles Ebel, writing in the 1960s, \\"Massalia was not an isolated Greek city, but had developed an Empire of its own along the coast of southern Gaul by the fourth century\\".Transalpine Gaul: the emergence of a Roman province by Charles Ebel p.2 But the idea of a Massalian \\"empire\\" is no longer credible in the light of recent archaeological evidence, which shows that Massalia never even had a very large chora (agricultural territory under its direct control).Archaeologies of Colonialism: Consumption, Entanglement, and Violence in Ancient Mediterranean France by Michael Dietler, 2010 However further archaeological evidence since shows Massalia had over twelve cities in its network in France, Spain, Monaco and Corsica. Cities Massalia founded that still exist today are Nice, Antibes, Monaco, Le Brusc, Agde, and Aleria. There is evidence of direct rule of at least two of their cities with a flexible system of autonomy as suggested by Emporion and Rhodus' own coin minting. Massalia's empire was not the same as the monolithic of the ancient world or of the nineteenth century being a scattered group of cities connected by the sea and rivers. The Delian League was also a scattered group of cities spread far across the sea and became known as the Athenian Empire.The Greek Empire of Marseille: Discoverer of Britain, Saviour of Rome by Christopher Gunstone, 2013, p.37, p.150 Massalia eventually became a centre of culture which drew some Roman parents to send their children there to be educated. According to earlier views, a purported hellenization of Southern France prior to the Roman Conquest of Transalpine Gaul is thought to have been largely due to the influence of Massalia., Chapter I, \\"Greeks and Celts\\" However, more recent scholarship has shown that the idea of Hellenization was illusory (and that the concept itself is seriously flawed). The power and cultural influence of Massalia have been called into question by demonstrating the limited territorial control of the city and showing the distinctive cultures of indigenous societies. Local Gauls were not Grecophiles who wanted to imitate Greek culture, but peoples who selectively consumed a very limited range of Greek objects (mostly ceramic vessels for drink) that they incorporated into their own cultural practices according to their own systems of value.\\"The Iron Age in Mediterranean France: colonial encounters, entanglements, and transformations\\" by Michael Dietler, Journal of World Prehistory 1997, vol.11, pages 269-357 Greek trade in Gaul Vix krater, an imported Greek wine- mixing vessel from 500 BC attests to the trade exchanges of the period These eastern Greeks, established on the shores of southern France, were in close relations with the Celtic inhabitants of the region, and during the late 6th and 5th centuries BC Greek artifacts penetrated northwards alongs the Rh√¥ne and Sa√¥ne valleys as well as the Is√®re.

Coins in northern Gaul were especially influenced by the coinage of Philip II of Macedon and his famous son Alexander the Great. Celtic coins often retained Greek subjects, such as the head of Apollo on the obverse and two-horse chariot on the reverse of the gold stater of Philip II, but developed their own style from that basis, thus establishing a Graeco-Celtic synthesis. After this first period in which Celtic coins rather faithfully reproduced Greek types, designs started to become more symbolic, as exemplified by the coinage of the Parisii in the Belgic region of northern France. By the 2nd century BC, the Greek chariot was only represented by a symbolic wheel. The Armorican Celtic style in northwestern Gaul also developed from Celtic designs from the Rhine valley, themselves derived from earlier Greek prototypes such as the wine scroll and split palmette. With the Roman invasion of Gaul, Greek-inspired Celtic coinage started to incorporate Roman influence instead, until it disappeared to be completely replaced by Roman coinage. By the 1st century BC, the coinage of the Greeks of Marseille circulated freely in Gaul, also influencing coinage as far afield as Great Britain. The coins of the Sunbury hoard, thought to have been manufactured in Kent, show designs derived from Greek coins from Marseille with the stylised head of Apollo and a butting bull.Museum of London exhibit Recently original bronze coins 3rd-2nd century BC from Greek Marseille have been found in several locations around Kent, UK.The Greek Empire of Marseille: Discoverer of Britain, Saviour of Rome, (2013) p. 176, p. 548 Coins from the 5th to 1st century BC Celtic coin designs progressively became more abstract, as is exemplified by the coins of the Parisii: File:Massalia_coin_5th_1st_century_BCE.jpg|Massalia File:Rhoda coins 5th 1st century BCE.jpg|Rhoda File:Emporiae_coins_5th_1st_century_BCE.jpg|Emporiae Image:CoinsOfTheParisii.jpg|Parisii File:Sunbury hoard Northern probably Kent manfacture Design derived from Marseilles Greek coins with stylised head of Apollo and butting bull between 100BCE and 50BCE.jpg|Sunbury-on-Thames, Britain, 100‚Äì50 BCShowing stylised head of Apollo and butting bull File:Sequani coin 5th to 1st century BCE.jpg|Gold coin of the Sequani (based in present-day Franche-Comt√©) File:Sequani coin 5th to 1st century BCE 2nd.jpg|Biga and driver on a Sequanian coin File:Santones_gold_coin_5_to_1st_century_BCE.jpg|Santones (based in present- day Charente-Maritime) File:Santones_gold_coin_5_to_1st_century_BCE_alt.jpg|More abstract chariot and driver on Santonian coin See also * Pytheas * Emporion Notes References    Category:Ancient peoples of France Category:France‚ÄìGreece relations Category:Pre-Roman Gaul ","title":"Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul"},{"id":"24639778","text":"Ernest D.

As Attorney General, he argued before the United States Supreme Court in the landmark case, Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania v. Casey on behalf of Robert P. Casey, then governor of Pennsylvania. Preate also successfully argued another landmark case, Blystone v. Pennsylvania in the United States Supreme Court addressing the death penalty. Prior to serving as Attorney General, Preate was district attorney of Lackawanna County. He ran for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1994, but came in second for the Republican nomination behind then-congressman Tom Ridge, who won the general election. In 1995, Preate went to jail after pleading guilty to mail fraud charges. Early career and education Ernest D.

Military service He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1966-1969 as Infantry Platoon Commander. He spent 13 months in combat in Vietnam and was honorably discharged with the rank of Captain. Preate earned 5 medals for combat service. Career Preate was elected Lackawanna County District Attorney in 1977 and served until 1989. He was an active trial prosecutor, specializing in homicide and drug cases. As District Attorney, he won all 19 murder cases that went to verdict and obtained the death penalty in 5 cases. His numerous appellate arguments include 2 major cases before the U.S. Supreme Court where he was successful in getting the Court to hold, as Constitutional, Pennsylvania‚Äôs Death Penalty Law (which he would later argue against) and its Abortion Control Act. He was a member of the National Association of Attorneys General where his colleagues elected him Chairman of the Criminal Law Committee. He was the Association‚Äôs official delegate to the American Bar Association, where he was co-founder and first chair of the Government and Public Sector Lawyers Division of the American Bar Association and received numerous awards for his service to law enforcement and the justice system. Conviction He was elected Attorney General of Pennsylvania in 1988, taking office in 1989. He was re-elected in 1992, but resigned that position in 1995 after being charged with federal racketeering and corruption. He pleaded guilty to mail fraud involving a $20,000.00 campaign contribution and served a year in Federal prison. He was succeeded as Attorney General by Tom Corbett, who later went on the become Governor of Pennsylvania. Later career Since his return to Scranton, he has resumed the practice of law, doing criminal and civil trial work. He has also been retained as a lobbyist by numerous prison and Criminal Justice reform groups. He has served as a consultant to Chuck Colson‚Äôs Prison Fellowship in Reston, Virginia, which advocates rehabilitative and faith-based reform of the criminal justice system and has become outspoken about the shortcomings of the U.S. criminal justice system, urging reforms to enable the public to have greater confidence that justice was done in judicial proceedings. He now believes that there ought to be a moratorium on the carrying out of the death penalty under the very statue he successfully defended in the U.S. Supreme Court. He now believes that as it has been applied, it falls unevenly and unfairly on people of color, and that the criminal justice system inadequately provides effective assistance of counsel to those accused. Reform As a lobbyist, Preate has promoted legislative consideration of public policy initiatives such as provision of tests to prisoners. This proposal was signed into law on July 10, 2002. He also calls for Pennsylvania to do a first in a generation study of the prisoner population to see if there are better ways that the 7,500 mentally ill and intellectually disabled prisoners can be compassionately dealt with, that the 7,000 Hepatitis C prisoners can be effectively treated, that the thousands of sick, disabled, or dying geriatric prisoners can be humanely managed, and, that Pennsylvania‚Äôs often arbitrary and rehabilitative stifling parole system be revamped.

Introduction \\"Brazil: Never Again\\" was a research project published in its original version, Brasil: Nunca Mais (BNM) in Portuguese in 1985 and was republished in an English-language copy entitled Torture in Brazil. The project, whose authors reserved their anonymity as a safety precaution, collected and analyzed documents for more than 707 Brazilian military court proceedings spanning the time frame from 1964 to 1979. These documents detail and expose the atrocious tortures that took place under Brazil's repressive military system of government. The goal of the BNM project was to supply concrete proof of Brazil's political oppression by delivering official legal proceedings drafted and approved by the very organization accused of such oppression. By providing such irrefutable proof, the members of the project hoped to negate any claim that the victims of torture were politically motivated and/or biased in their accounts of the abuse suffered at the hands of military and police personnel. Background The coup that displaced Brazil's president amidst a backdrop of political and economic instability took place on April 1, 1964. A faction of Brazil's military unseated President Jo√£o Goulart and assumed power under the Institutional Act of 9 April 1964. This act legitimized the military junta as the dominant authority in Brazil. Within days of taking control of the Brazilian government in 1964, the military regime began categorizing society in two ways: civilians and subversive enemies. Almost immediately, Operation Cleanup (Opera√ß√£o Limpeza) was created, and the government began kidnapping, imprisoning, and torturing thousands of suspected subversives. Standard Torture Procedures Under the Brazilian military regime from 1964 to 1985, torture was not only condoned, but also institutionalized. Methods and procedures for torture became such an integral part of the military government's oppressive tactics that the military integrated classes on torture into their training program. Some of the defendants from the court documents were forced to participate in the practical application portion of the class; these individuals were tortured in front of the classroom of students as a pedagogical approach. The following list provides some of the methods the interrogators used while torturing the defendants: ‚Ä¢ The Parrot's Perch ‚Ä¢ Electric Shock ‚Ä¢ Drowning ‚Ä¢ The Dragon's Chair ‚Ä¢ The Ice Box ‚Ä¢ Insects and Animals (such as snakes, alligators, cockroaches) ‚Ä¢ Chemical Products ‚Ä¢ Physical Injury The motive behind the use of torture was not to cause physical pain as punishment but rather to physically, emotionally, and morally break down the victim. Once the individual has become so extremely weakened in these multiple facets, the government's hope was that he or she would be unable to uphold any prior familial or political loyalties and instead confess the information that he or she was trying to protect. Because the government wanted information as quickly as possible, it was not unusual to torture women or torture or threaten children who were related to the suspect in order to break down the suspect's mental and emotional composure. Victims Of the more than 707 court reports that BNM categorized, analyzed and documented, they provided data indexing 695 cases. In those cases, 88% of the 7,367 defendants were male and the majority were members of the middle class. BNM classified many of the torture defendants into the following afflicted groups: #Political organizations: Brazilian Communist Party (PCB), Armed Dissidents, Communist Party of Brazil (PC DO B), Popular Action (Ac√£o Popular- AP), Marxist Revolutionary Organization-Workers' Politics (POLOP), Trotskyite Groups, and Revolutionary Nationalism Groups. #Social Groups: Military personnel, union leaders, students, political figures, journalists, and religious workers. #Any individuals guilty of the following three activities could be subject to torture: activities in support of the former President Goulart's government, subversive propaganda and criticism of authorities. Lasting Effects Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff is a former guerrilla who was part of the Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard in the '70s. She revealed in testimonies in 2001 and 2005 details of the torture she was subjected to by military officials. Rousseff recounts having been stripped naked and suspended upside down, with bound wrists and ankles. While in this position, she was \\"submitted to electric shocks on different parts of her body, including her breasts, inner thighs and head\\" and was beaten in the face. Retired military officials accused of torturing Rousseff have questioned evidence and accused Rousseff of belonging to an armed militant group that sought to install a Soviet-inspired dictatorship. Rousseff vowed to donate her reparation check of about $10,000 to Torture Never Again in May 2012. Chile's former president Michelle Bachelet is a survivor of detention and torture after a 1973 military coup. Uruguay's president Jos√© Mujica is a former leader of the Tupamaro guerrilla organization who was tortured during nearly a decade and a half of imprisonment. World-renowned architect Oscar Niemeyer agreed to design a monument condemning torture for Rio de Janeiro in 1985. The project was proposed by the activist group Grupo Tortura Nunca Mais, founded during the first months of civilian government following twenty-one years of military dictatorship in Brazil. The group's members were torture victims and/or family members of victims. The monument, however, has yet to be installed. A key aim of the project was to expose aspects of the history of dictatorship. They also hoped the monument would help to console victims and their families and inspire and inform conversation about the recent history of Brazil. Grupo Tortura Nunca Mais won municipal approval for two other major projects. The first was supposed to rename streets and plazas in homage to those who had disappeared or been assassinated, and the second, to convert the former police headquarters in Rio into a cultural center and state archive. In 1993, the city of Recife, Brazil, inaugurated a monument recognizing the victims of torture during the military dictatorship, known as the Torture Never Again Monument. In 1988, the city held a competition for the design, and over 20 artists entered. , a Brazilian architect and sculptor, led the winning team. The monument depicts a man in the \\"pau de arara,\\" or parrot's perch, torture position, in which victims are hung upside down with their wrists and ankles bound. This is a practice that current Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff endured. The Amnesty Act In 1979, the Brazilian Congress met to consider the proposal for amnesty from the government of Jo√£o Figueiredo. The House was highly biased towards the military, with soldiers occupying nearly 800 of the 1200 seats. The people protested to change the amnesty agreement, since it consisted of amnesty only for the violent military crimes. The treaty only served to restore the political rights of those who opposed the dictatorship, but offered no compensation to the victims or their families. Given that in certain cases of torture, such as Frei Tito's, were so brutal that they ended in the suicide of the victim, the people expected some form of compensation. When the bill for the Amnesty Project was to be passed, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), the political party opposing the dictatorship, boycotted the ceremony, protesting that the settlement was in no way favorable to the victims or the opponents of the dictatorship. In addition, the law served as a shield to those who had violated human rights and protected them from prosecution; these perpetrators have yet to face criminal justice.

The adults are about 2 to 3 cm long and are usually bright glassy green appearing reddish at some angles. The clypeus is narrow and there is a ridge along the middle. They are seen in aggregations made up of large numbers in southern India during June to October. Description The colour changes with angle and lighting Adult beetles are emerald green with some varieties blue, red (var. fulgidissima), indigo, or black (var. anthracina). The sides of the hind coxae are orange. The elytra are glazed, with no deep pits on the surface and only tiny spots arranged in lines. The prothorax has punctures only along the sides and the scutellum is without any punctures. The antennae, legs, suture margins, posterior of the elytra and the apical calli are black. The clypeus may have some punctures and is squarish with parallel sides. The front margin is straight and toothed in the middle, the tooth is minutely notched. The forehead has lobed ridges running longitudinally. On the underside the sternal process is narrow and blunt, slightly curved. The middle and hind tibia are fringed with hairs in both the male and female. The hind tibiae bear a tuft of hairs near the tip with the males having longer hind tarsi than the females with the abdomen channelled beneath allowing them to mount females. Underside showing the short and blunt sternal process The physics of the colouration of the cuticle is a subject of interest as the colours are entirely structural, not produced by pigments, and nearly 200-year-old specimens show no degradation of the colours. The underlying structures made up of nearly 50 microscopic double layers have been studied in the search for structural paints that do not need pigments which are often environmentally toxic chemicals.
