Since colonial years, race has still played an important factor in determining social class. History Haitian girlsHaitian artist Edouard Duval-CarrieFactory worker In the colonial period, the French imposed a three-tiered social structure similar to the casta system in colonial Hispanic America. At the top of the social and political ladder was the white elite (grands blancs). At the bottom of the social structure were the enslaved black (noirs), most of whom had been born in Africa. Between the white elite and the slaves arose a third group, the freedmen (affranchis), most of whom were descended from unions of slave owners and slaves (cf. plaçage). Some Mulatto freedmen inherited land from their white fathers, became relatively wealthy and owned slaves (perhaps as many as one-fourth of all slaves in Saint-Domingue belonged to affranchi owners). Nevertheless, racial codes kept the affranchis socially and politically inferior to the whites in the racial hierarchy. Also between the white elite and the slaves were the poor whites (petits blancs), who considered themselves socially superior to the Mulattoes, even if they sometimes found themselves economically inferior to them. Of a population of 519,000 in 1791, 87 percent were slaves, 8 percent were whites, and 5 percent were freedmen. Because of harsh living and working conditions, the mortality rate among the enslaved blacks was extremely high, so new slaves were continuously imported to replace the ones who died. Thus, at the time of the slave rebellion of 1791, most slaves had been born in Africa rather than in Saint-Domingue.Smucker, Glenn R. \\"Social Structure\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Haitian Revolution changed the country's social structure. The colonial ruling class, and much of the white population, was killed or expelled, and the plantation economy was largely destroyed. The earliest black and mulatto leaders attempted to restore a plantation system that relied on an essentially free labor force, through strict military control (see Independent Haiti, ch. 6), but the system collapsed during the tenure of Alexandre Pétion (1806–18). The Haitian Revolution broke up plantations and distributed land among the former slaves. Through this process, the new Haitian upper class lost control over agricultural land and labor, which had been the economic basis of colonial control. To maintain their superior economic and social position, the new Haitian upper class turned away from agricultural pursuits in favor of more urban-based activities, particularly government. The nineteenth-century Haitian ruling class consisted of two groups: the urban elite and the military leadership. The urban elite were primarily a closed group of educated, comparatively wealthy, and French-speaking Mulattoes. Birth determined an individual's social position, and shared values and intermarriage reinforced class solidarity. The military, however, was a means of advancement for disadvantaged black Haitians. In a shifting, and often uneasy, alliance with the military, the urban elite ruled the country and kept the peasantry isolated from national affairs. The urban elite promoted French norms and models as a means of separating themselves from the peasantry. Thus, French language and manners, orthodox Roman Catholicism, and light skin were important criteria of high social position. The elite disdained manual labor, industry, and commerce in favor of the more genteel professions, such as law and medicine. A small, but politically important, middle class emerged during the twentieth century. Although social mobility increased slightly, the traditional elite retained their economic preeminence, despite countervailing efforts by François Duvalier. For the most part, the peasantry continued to be excluded from national affairs, but by the 1980s, this isolation had decreased significantly. Still, economic hardship in rural areas caused many cultivators to migrate to the cities in search of a higher standard of living, thereby increasing the size of the urban lower class. Upper class In the 1980s, Haiti's upper class constituted as little as 2 percent of the total population, but it controlled about 44 percent of the national income. The upper class included not only the traditional elite, which had not controlled the government for more than thirty years, but also individuals who had become wealthy and powerful through their connections with the governments of François Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude Duvalier. Increased access to education helped carry some individuals into the ranks of the upper class. Others were able to move upward because of wealth they accrued in industry or export-import businesses.Smucker, Glenn R. \\"The Upper Class\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Princess of Haiti Olive Fictional representatives of the Haitian elite such as the \\"Zuzu girl\\" (a naive rich bubblehead), and other recognizable cultural stereotypes, have been caricatured in the popular cultural comedy, Regards Croisés, on Télévision Nationale d'Haïti (TNH), the state television broadcaster of Haiti. The traditional elite held key positions in trade, industry, real estate, and the professions, and they were identified by membership in \\"good families,\\" which claimed several generations of recognized legal status and name. Being a member of the elite also required a thorough knowledge of cultural refinements, particularly the customs of the French. Light skin and straight hair continued to be important characteristics of this group. French surnames were common among the mulatto elite, but increased immigration from Europe and the Middle East in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries had introduced German, English, Danish, and Arabic names to the roster. The only group described as an ethnic minority in Haiti were the Arab Haitians, people descended from Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian traders who began to arrive in Haiti and elsewhere in the Caribbean in the late nineteenth century. From their beginnings, as itinerant peddlers of fabrics and other dry goods, the Arabs moved into the export-import sector, engendering the hostility of Haitians and foreign rivals. Nevertheless, the Arabs remained. Many adopted French and Creole as their preferred languages, took Haitian citizenship, and integrated themselves into the upper and the middle classes. Formerly spurned by elite Mulatto families and excluded from the best clubs, the Arabs had begun to intermarry with elite Haitians and to take part in all aspects of upper-class life, including entry into the professions, industry, and so on. Middle class The middle class also known as the bourgeois, was essentially nonexistent during the nineteenth century. But at about the time of the United States occupation (1915–34), it became more defined (see The United States Occupation, 1915–34, ch. 6). The creation of a professional military and the expansion of government services fostered the development of Haiti's middle class. Educational reform in the 1920s, an upsurge in black consciousness, and the wave of economic prosperity after World War II also contributed to the strengthening of the class. In the late 1980s, the middle class probably made up less than 5 percent of the total population, but it was growing, and it was becoming more politically powerful.Smucker, Glenn R. \\"The Middle Class\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The mulatto elite dominated governments in the 1930s and the early 1940s and thwarted the political aspirations of the black middle class. President Dumarsais Estimé (1946–50) came to power with the aim of strengthening the middle class. The Duvalier government also claimed the allegiance of the black middle class, at least through the 1970s. During the Duvalier period, many in the middle class owed their economic security to the government. A number of individuals from this class, however, benefited from institutionalized corruption. Some members of the middle class had acquired political power by the 1980s, but most continued to be culturally ambivalent and insecure. Class solidarity, identity, and traditions were all weak. The criteria for membership in the middle class included a non-manual occupation, a moderate income, literacy, and a mastery of French. Middle-class Haitians sought upward mobility for themselves and their children, and they perceived education and urban residence as two essential keys to achieving higher status. Although they attempted to emulate the lifestyle of the upper class, middle-class Haitians resented the social preeminence and the color prejudice of the elite. Conflicts between the Franco-Haitian and the Afro-Haitian cultural traditions were most common among the middle class. Peasants Haiti's peasantry constituted approximately 75 percent of the total population. Unlike peasants in much of Latin America, most of Haiti's peasants had owned land since the early nineteenth century. Land was the most valuable rural commodity, and peasant families went to great lengths to retain it and to increase their holdings.Smucker, Glenn R. \\"Peasants\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Peasants in general had control over their landholdings, but many lacked clear title to their plots. Haiti has never conducted a cadastral survey, but it is likely that many families have passed on land over generations without updating land titles. Division of land equally among male and female heirs resulted in farm plots that became too small to warrant the high costs of a surveyor. Heirs occasionally surveyed land before taking possession of it, but more frequently, heirs divided plots among themselves in the presence of community witnesses and often a notary. Some inherited land was not divided, but was used in common, for example, for pasture, or it was worked by heirs in rotation. Families commonly sold land to raise cash for such contingencies as funerals or to pay the expenses of emigration. Purchasers often held land with a notarized paper, rather than a formal deed (see Land Tenure and Land Policy, ch. 8). There were strata within the peasantry based on the amount of property owned. Many peasants worked land as sharecroppers or tenants, and some hoped eventually to inherit the plots they worked. Some tenant farmers owned and cultivated plots in addition to the land they worked for others. The number of entirely landless peasants who relied solely on wage labor was probably quite small. Agricultural wages were so low that peasants deprived of land were likely to migrate to urban areas in search of higher incomes. Wealthier peasants maintained their economic positions through the control of capital and influence in local politics. Peasants maintained a strong, positive identity as Haitians and as cultivators of the land, but they exhibited a weak sense of class consciousness. Rivalries among peasants were more common than unified resentment toward the upper class. Cooperation among peasants diminished during the twentieth century. Farms run by nuclear families and exchanges among extended families had formed the basis of the agrarian system. Until the middle of the twentieth century, collective labor teams, called kounbit, and larger labor-exchange groups were quite common. These groups were formed to carry out specific tasks on an individual's land; the owner provided music and a festive meal. After the 1940s, smaller groups, called eskouad, began to replace the kounbit. The eskouad carried out tasks on a strictly reciprocal basis or sold their collective labor to other peasants. Although Haitian peasant villages generally lacked a sense of community and civic- mindedness, some civic-action groups had emerged over the years. After the 1960s, wealthy peasants led rural community councils, which were supervised by the government. These councils often served more to control the flow of development resources into an area than to represent the local population. In the 1980s, a countervailing movement of small peasant groups (groupman) emerged with support from the Roman Catholic Church, principally in the Plateau Central. The groupman discussed common interests and undertook some cooperative activities. Both the Duvalier governments and the succeeding National Council of Government (Conseil National de Gouvernement—CNG), headed by Lieutenant General Henri Namphy, took steps to curb the activities of these peasant groups. The first generation of Haitian peasants pursued self- sufficiency, freedom, and peace. The necessity of devoting at least some share of their limited hectarage to the production of cash crops, however, hindered the peasants' ability to achieve self-sufficiency in the cultivation of domestic staples. Although they acquired a degree of freedom, they also found themselves isolated from the rest of the nation and the world. In the second half of the twentieth century, the Haitian peasantry gradually became much less isolated. Several factors accelerated the peasants' involvement with the outside world in the 1970s and the 1980s. Road projects improved the transportation system, and foreign religious missions and private development agencies penetrated the rural areas. These organizations brought new resources and provided an institutional link to the outside world. Many people from almost every community had migrated to Port-au-Prince or overseas, and they sent money home to rural areas. Cassette tapes enabled illiterate people who had traveled far from home to communicate with their families. Creole, which became widely used on radio, brought news of Haiti and the world to remote villages. And in 1986, media coverage of the fall of the Duvalier regime put rural Haitians in touch with the political affairs of the nation. Urban lower class The urban lower class, which made up about 15 percent of the total population in the early 1980s, was concentrated in Port-au-Prince and the major coastal towns. Increased migration from rural areas contributed greatly to the growth of this class. Industrial growth was insufficient, however, to absorb the labor surplus produced by the burgeoning urbanization; unemployment and underemployment were severe in urban areas. The urban lower class was socially heterogeneous, and it had little class consciousness. One outstanding characteristic of this group was its commitment to education. Despite economic hardships, urban lower-class parents made a real effort to keep their children in school throughout the primary curriculum. Through education and political participation, some members of the lower class achieved mobility into the middle class.Smucker, Glenn R. \\"Urban Lower Class\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The poorest strata of the urban lower class lived under Haiti's worst sanitary and health conditions. According to the World Bank (see Glossary), one-third of the population of Port-au-Prince lived in densities of more than 1,000 people per hectare in 1976. The poorest families consumed as few as seven liters of water per person, per day, for cooking, drinking, and cleaning, and they spent about one-fifth of their income to obtain it. For many of these families, income and living conditions worsened in the 1980s.

The board appoints the state forester and oversees the Oregon Department of Forestry. The board also works with private land owners and the Federal Government to promote consistent forest management policies throughout the state.  History  Oregon began to centralize its forest management in 1905, when the state authorized local fire rangers to patrol Oregon counties and enforce the newly created fire protection laws. Two years later, the state established a temporary board to make recommendations to Oregon legislature regarding forests practices. As an advisory board, it had little power beyond its reports to the legislative assembly.\\"Historical Narrative, 1907-1960\\", Department of Forestry Records Guide, Oregon State Archives, Oregon Secretary of State, June 2000. In 1911, the Oregon legislature formally established a state Department of Forestry with the Board of Forestry as its oversight body. Together these institutions were made responsible for enforcing forestry laws, managing state forest lands, preventing forest fires within the state, encouraging reforestation, and educating the public about good forestry practices. Prior to 1939, the Board of Forestry shared the responsibility for state parks with the Oregon Highway Commission. In 1939, the Oregon Legislative made the Highway Commission solely responsible for state parks. At the same time, the Board of Forestry was given administration jurisdiction over the Forest Development Fund. The first version of the Forestry Program for Oregon was published in 1977. It outlined a vision for Oregon's forests and established strategies priorities to guide the board's decisions. Since then, the board has periodically published new versions of the document to update management policies and refine forestry programs.The Evolving Forestry Program for Oregon, 2003 Forestry program for Oregon, Oregon Board of Forestry, Salem, Oregon, 2003, p. 7.

The board works with private land owners, Oregon counties, the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and other Federal agencies to promote consistent management policies and practices for all forest lands within the state. The Board of Forestry and the professional foresters in the Department of Forestry are responsible for managing Oregon's forest lands on behalf of the people of Oregon.Kulongoski, Ted, Speech by Governor Kulongoski at Board of Forestry Meeting, Salem Oregon, 22 October 2004.  Board organization  The Board of Forestry has seven members appointed by the Governor of Oregon and confirmed by the Oregon State Senate. Members serve a four-year term, and are limited to two consecutive terms. Oregon law requires the board to represent the broad interests of the Oregon public. Therefore, no more than three members of the board can receive a significant portion of their income from the forest products industry, and at least one member must reside in each of the three major forest regions of the state. The Board of Forestry has three sub-committees made up of board members who are working on specific issues for the board. The subcommittees are created to consider specific issues and develop recommendations for the full board's consideration and action. The three subcommittees are the Federal Forests Subcommittee, the State Forests Financial Viability Subcommittee, and the Alternative Forest Management Plans Subcommittee.\\"About the Oregon Board of Forestry\\", Oregon Board of Forestry, Oregon Department of Forestry, Salem, Oregon, 19 May 2014.

The regional committees represent northwest Oregon, southwest Oregon, and eastern Oregon.\\"Authority and Purpose\\", Regional Forest Practice Committees, Oregon Department of Forestry, Salem, Oregon, 19 May 2014.  Forestry program  Sustainable forest management is the board's long-term goal. To achieve this, forest resources must be used, developed, and protected in a manner that enables people to meet their current environmental, economic, and social needs while ensuring that the needs of future generations will also be met. The Board of Forestry publishes the Forestry Program for Oregon to guide forest management within the state. Since it was first published in 1977, \\"sustainability\\" has remained the forestry program's central theme. On a statewide basis, sustainable forest management creates a healthy and diverse forest ecosystem that produces abundant timber and other forest products. Habitat to support healthy populations of native plants and animals is maintained. It ensures productive soil, clean water, clean air, and recreational opportunities are protected. This balanced program supports Oregon's people and their communities both economically and socially. The Forestry Program for Oregon serves as a strategic guide for the Department of Forestry's day-to-day management decisions.

The role of agriculture in the economy has declined severely since the 1950s, when the sector employed 80 percent of the labor force, represented 50 percent of GDP, and contributed 90 percent of exports. Many factors have contributed to this decline. Some of the major ones included the continuing fragmentation of landholdings, low levels of agricultural technology, migration out of rural areas, insecure land tenure, a lack of capital investment, high commodity taxes, the low productivity of undernourished animals, plant diseases, and inadequate infrastructure. Neither the government nor the private sector invested much in rural ventures; in FY 1989 only 5 percent of the national budget went to the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development (Ministère de l'Agriculture, des Resources Naturelles et du Développement Rural—MARNDR). As Haiti entered the 1990s, however, the main challenge to agriculture was not economic, but ecological. Extreme deforestation, soil erosion, droughts, flooding, and the ravages of other natural disasters had all led to a critical environmental situation.Malik, Boulos A. \\"Agriculture\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. After independence from France Alexandre Pétion (and later Jean-Pierre Boyer) undertook Latin America's first, and perhaps most radical, land reform by subdividing plantations for the use of emancipated slaves. The reform measures were so extensive that by 1842 no plantation was its original size. By the mid-nineteenth century, therefore, Haiti's present-day land structure was largely in place. The basic structures of land tenure remained remarkably stable during the twentieth century, despite steadily increasing pressure for land, the fragmentation of land parcels, and a slight increase in the concentration of ownership.Malik, Boulos A. \\"Land Tenure and Land Policy\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. For historical reasons, Haiti's patterns of land tenure were quite different from those of other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Most Haitians owned at least some of their land. Complex forms of tenancy also distinguished Haitian land tenure. Moreover, land owned by peasants often varied in the size and number of plots, the location and topography of the parcels, and other factors. Scholars have debated issues related to land tenure and agriculture in Haiti because they considered census data unreliable. Other primary data available to them were geographically limited and frequently out of date. The three national censuses of 1950, 1971, and 1982 provided core information on land tenure, but other studies financed by the United States Agency for International Development (AID) supplemented and updated census data. The final tabulations of the 1982 census were still unavailable in late 1989. The 1971 census revealed that there were 616,700 farms in Haiti, and that an average holding of 1.4 hectares consisted of several plots of less than 1 hectare. Haitians, however, most commonly measured their land by the common standard, a carreau, equal to about 1.3 hectares, or 3.2 acres. The survey concluded that the largest farms made up only 3 percent of the total number of farms and that they comprised less than 20 percent of the total land. It also documented that 60 percent of farmers owned their land, although some lacked official title to it. Twenty- eight percent of all farmers rented and sharecropped land. Only a small percentage of farms belonged to cooperatives. The 1950 census, by contrast, had found that 85 percent of farmers owned their land. Studies in the 1980s indicated a trend toward increased fragmentation of peasant lands, an expanding role for sharecropping and renting, and a growing concentration of higher quality land, particularly in the irrigated plains. As a consequence of high rural population density and deteriorating soils, competition over land appeared to be intensifying. Haiti's land density, that is, the number of people per square kilometer of arable land, jumped from 296 in 1965 to 408 by the mid-1980s—a density greater than that in India. The three major forms of land tenancy in Haiti were ownership, renting (or subleasing), and sharecropping. Smallholders typically acquired their land through purchase, inheritance, or a claim of long-term use. Many farmers also rented land temporarily from the state, absentee landlords, local owners, or relatives. In turn, renters frequently subleased some of these lands, particularly parcels owned by the state. Renters generally enjoyed more rights to the land they worked than did sharecroppers. Unlike sharecroppers, however, renters had to pay for land in advance, typically for a period of one year. The prevalence of renting made the land market exceedingly dynamic; even small farmers rented land, depending on the amount of extra income they derived from raising cash crops. Sharecropping, also very common, was usually a shorter-term agreement, perhaps lasting only one growing season. Sharecropper and landowner partnerships were less exploitive than those in many other Latin American countries; in most agreements, farmers gave landowners half the goods they produced on the land. Other land arrangements included managing land for absentee landlords, squatting, and wage labor. The practice of having an on- site overseer (jéran) manage land for another owner, usually another peasant residing far away, was a variation of sharecropping. Jérans were generally paid in-kind for their custodial services. Overgrazing, or unregulated gardening, was the most common form of squatting, which took place on most kinds of lands, especially state-owned land. A small minority of peasants were landless; they worked as day laborers or leased subsistence plots. In addition, thousands of Haitians migrated seasonally to the Dominican Republic as braceros (temporary laborers) to cut sugarcane under wretched conditions. Land use and farming technology Mountainous farming plots near Port-au- Prince, Haiti It is easy to not understand the complex variations in land tenancy without an appreciation of land use and peasant attitudes toward land. More mountainous than Switzerland, Haiti has a limited amount of cultivable land. According to soil surveys by the United States Department of Agriculture in the early 1980s, 11.3 percent of the land was highly suitable for crops, while 31.7 percent was suitable with some restrictions related to erosion, topography, or conservation. The surveys revealed that 2.3 percent was mediocre because of poor drainage, but was acceptable for rice cultivation, and 54.7 percent was appropriate only for tree crops or pastures because of severe erosion or steep slopes. According to estimates of land use in 1978, 42.2 percent of land was under constant or shifting cultivation, 19.2 percent was pasture land, and 38.6 percent was not cultivated.Malik, Boulos A. \\"Land Use and Farming Technology\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The use of purchased inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, machinery, and irrigation, was rare; farmers in Haiti employed traditional agricultural practices more than did farmers in any other part of the Western Hemisphere. Although Haitian farmers used increased amounts of chemical fertilizers in the 1970s and the 1980s, their use of an average of only seven kilograms per hectare ranked Haiti ahead of Bolivia, only, among Western Hemisphere countries. Peasants applied mostly natural fertilizers, such as manure, mulch, and bat guano. Large landowners consumed most of the country's small amounts of chemical fertilizers, and they benefited from subsidized fertilizers imported from the Dominican Republic and mixed in Port-au-Prince. Five importers controlled the 400,000 kilograms of pesticides that entered the country each year; malaria-carrying mosquitoes and rodents in the rice fields were the main targets of pesticide application. Most rural cultivators used small hand tools, such as hoes, machetes, digging sticks, and a local machete- like tool called the serpette. There was an average of one tractor per 1,700 hectares; most farmers considered such machinery inappropriate for use on tiny plots scattered along deeply graded hillsides. The insecurity of land tenure further discouraged the use of capital inputs. The amount of irrigated crop land in the 1980s, estimated at between 70,000 and 110,00 hectares, was substantially less than the 140,000 hectares of colonial times. Of the nearly 130 irrigation systems in place, many lacked adequate maintenance, were clogged with silt, or provided irregular supplies to their 80,000 users. By the 1980s, the irrigation network had been extended as far as was possible. The minimal amount of research on agriculture and the limited number of extension officers that MARNDR provided gave little assistance to already low levels of farming technology. Foreign organizations, such as the Inter- American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture, carried out the most research. Foreign organizations also provided more technical assistance in agriculture than the government. Peasant attitudes and limited access to credit also helped to explain the traditional nature of farming. Most observers blamed agricultural underdevelopment on peasants' individualistic nature, their proclivity toward superstition, and their unwillingness to innovate. Small farmers also lacked access to credit. Informal credit markets flourished, but credit was not always available at planting time. When credit was available, it was usually provided at usurious rates. The country's major public financial institutions provided loans to the agricultural sector, but this lending benefited less than 10 percent of all farmers. Major credit sources included the Agricultural Credit Bureau, agriculture credit societies, credit unions, cooperatives, and institutions created by nongovernmental organizations. Cash crops Despite its relative decline, coffee endured as the leading agricultural export during the 1980s. The French had introduced coffee to Haiti from Martinique in 1726, and soon coffee became an important colonial commodity. Coffee production peaked in 1790, and it declined steadily after independence. Production dropped precipitously during the 1960s. After a boom in prices and in the production of coffee in the late 1970s, output declined again from 42,900 tons in 1980 to 30,088 tons by 1987. Coffee trees covered an estimated 133,000 hectares in the 1980s, with an average annual yield of 35,900 tons. Haiti was a member of the International Coffee Organization (ICO), but found itself increasingly unable to fulfill its ICO export quota, which stood at 300,000 bags, of 60 kilograms each, in 1988. Most analysts believed that excessive taxation and the low prices afforded to peasant farmers had contributed to the decline in coffee production.Malik, Boulos A. \\"Cash Crops\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Coffee provides one of the best examples of the market orientation of Haiti's peasant economy. Most peasants grew coffee, usually alongside other crops. More than 1 million Haitians participated in the coffee industry as growers, marketers (known as Madame Sarahs), middlemen (spéculateurs), or exporters. The peasants' widespread participation throughout the coffee industry demonstrated that they were not merely subsistence farmers, but that they were also actively engaged in the market economy. After harvest by peasants, female Madame Sarahs transported coffee to local and urban markets and sold the beans. Middlemen, in turn, sold coffee to members of the Coffee Exporters Association (Association des Exportateurs de Café—Asdec), which set prices and thereby passed on the traditionally high coffee-export taxes directly to producers. Because of its prominent role in agriculture and the inequitable nature of the trade, the coffee industry was the subject of numerous studies. The majority of these studies highlighted imperfect competition and the systematic enrichment of a small group of Port-au-Prince exporters. Sugar was another cash crop with a long history in Haiti. Christopher Columbus brought sugarcane to present-day Haiti on his second voyage to Hispaniola, and sugar rapidly became the colony's most important cash crop. After 1804, production never returned to pre-independence levels, but sugar production and low-level exports continued. Unlike the system in other Caribbean countries, sugar in Haiti was a cash crop raised by peasants rather than by large-scale plantations. The sugar harvest dipped to under 4 million tons by the early 1970s, but it rebounded to nearly 6 million tons of cane by the middle of the decade with a sharp increase in the world price of the commodity. Lower world prices and structural problems combined to cause a drop in sugar output in the 1980s; by the end of the decade, sugarcane covered fewer than 114,000 hectares of the coastal plains, and it yielded fewer than 4.5 million tons annually. Further expansion of the sugar industry faced serious deeprooted obstacles. For example, the production cost of Haitian sugar was three times more than the world price in the 1980s. Shifts in the world sugar market, caused mainly by the international substitution of corn-based fructose for sugarcane, exerted further pressure on Haitian producers. One result of this situation was the practice of importing sugar, which was then reexported to the United States under the Haitian sugar quota. Reductions in Haiti's quota during the 1980s, however, limited exchanges of this sort. Total sugar exports dropped from 19,200 tons in 1980 to 6,500 tons in 1987. In 1981, 1982, and 1988 Haiti exported no sugar. Haiti's four sugar mills closed temporarily on several occasions during the decade. The oldest mill, the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO), was the only plant that maintained a large cane plantation. Realizing the dim future for sugar, outside development agencies proposed alternatives to sugar, such as soybeans, for Haiti's plains. Cacao, sisal, essential oils, and cotton were other significant cash crops. Cacao trees covered an estimated 10,400 hectares in 1987, and they yielded 4,000 tons of cocoa a year. Mennonite missionaries played a growing role in the cocoa industry, mostly around southern departments, especially Grand'Anse. Sisal, exported as a twine since 1927, peaked in the 1950s, as the Korean War demanded much of the nation's 40,000-ton output. By the 1980s, however, Haiti exported an average of only 6,500 tons a year, mainly to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. The substitution of synthetic fibers for sisal reduced most large-scale growing of the plant, but many peasants continued to harvest the natural fiber for its use in hats, shoes, carpets, and handbags. The export of essential oils, derived from vetiver, lime, amyris, and bitter orange, peaked in 1976 at 395 tons. Exports leveled off at a little more than 200 tons during the 1980s, generating an average of US$5 million in foreign exchange. Cotton cultivation peaked in the 1930s, before boll weevils ravaged the crop. Growers introduced a higher quality of cotton, in the 1960s, which was processed in local cotton gins and then exported to Europe. Cotton prices fell in the 1980s, however, and cotton plantings shrank from 12,400 hectares in 1979 to under 8,000 hectares by 1986. Exports ceased. Government policies in the 1980s emphasized diversification into nontraditional export crops that would benefit under the terms of the CBI; the poor performance of traditional cash crops enhanced the importance of these efforts for the Haitian economy. Food crops Food crops fared somewhat better than cash crops in the 1980s, as prices for cash crops dropped, and economic uncertainty increased. Nonetheless, real per capita food production declined, and the country continued to import millions of tons of grains. The trend toward increased production of food crops had negative ecological consequences as the planting and the harvesting of tuber staples accelerated soil erosion. Haiti's peasants were already underfed. It was therefore unlikely that farmers would grow tree crops in place of staples without appropriate incentives.Malik, Boulos A. \\"Food Crops\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Peasants cultivated a variety of cereals for food and animal feeds, notably corn, sorghum, and rice. Corn, also referred to as maize, was the leading food crop; it was sown on more hectares— 220,000 in 1987—than any other crop. Farmers in southern departments grew corn separately, but elsewhere they mixed it with other crops, mostly legumes. Total production averaged approximately 185,000 tons during the 1980s; yields increased in some areas. Drought-resistant sorghum often replaced corn during the second growing season as the leading crop, but total hectares planted and total production averaged only 156,250 and 125,000 tons, respectively. Rice became an increasingly common cereal, beginning in the 1960s, when increased irrigation of the Artibonite Valley aided larger- scale farming (see fig. 11). Rice production, however, fluctuated considerably, and it remained dependent on government subsidies. An estimated 60,000 hectares of rice yielded an average of 123,000 tons, from 1980 to 1987. Tubers were also cultivated as food. Sweet potatoes, one of the nation's largest crops, grew on an estimated 100,000 hectares, and they yielded 260,000 tons of produce a year in the 1980s. Manioc, or cassava, another major tuber, was mix-cropped on upwards of 60,000 hectares to produce between 150,000 and 260,000 tons a year, much of which was for direct consumption. The cultivation of yams, limited by the lack of deep moist soils, took up only 26,000 hectares. The tropical Pacific tuber taro, called malangá in Haiti, grew with other tubers on more than 27,000 hectares. Haitians also cultivated dozens of other food crops. Red, black, and other kinds of beans were very popular; they provided the main source of protein in the diet of millions. As many as 129,000 hectares provided 67,000 tons of beans in 1987. Banana and plantain trees were also common and provided as much as 500,000 tons of produce, almost entirely for domestic consumption. Although the flimsy trees were vulnerable to hurricanes and to droughts, rapid replanting helped sustain the crop. Mangoes, another tree crop, were a daily source of food, and they provided some exports. Other food crops included citrus fruit, avocados, pineapples, watermelons, almonds, coconut, okra, peanuts, tomatoes, breadfruit, and mamey (tropical apricot). In addition, Haitians grew a wide variety of spices for food, medicine, and other purposes, including thyme, anise, marjoram, absinthe, oregano, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, garlic, and horseradish. Livestock Most peasants possessed a few farm animals, usually goats, pigs, chickens and cattle. Few holdings, however, were large, and few peasants raised only livestock. Many farm animals, serving as a kind of savings account, were sold or were slaughtered to pay for marriage, medical emergencies, schooling, seeds for crops, or a vodou ceremony.Malik, Boulos A. \\"Livestock\\". A Country Study: Haiti (Richard A. Haggerty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. From the perspective of rural peasants, perhaps the most important event to occur in Haiti during the 1980s was the slaughter of the nation's pig stock, which had become infected with the highly contagious African swine fever (ASF) in the late 1970s. Having spread from Spain to the Dominican Republic and then to Haiti via the Artibonite River, ASF infected approximately one-third of the nation's pigs from 1978 to 1982. Farmers slaughtered their infected animals. Fear of further infection persuaded peasants to slaughter another one-third in panic sales. A government eradication program virtually wiped out what remained of the 1.2-million pig population by 1982. At the grassroots level, the government's eradication and repopulation programs became highly controversial. Farmers complained that they were not fairly compensated for—or not paid at all for—their slaughtered livestock and that the sentinel breed of pigs imported from the United States to replace the hardy creole pigs was inappropriate for the Haitian environment and economy. Nonetheless, repopulation of the nation's pigs with both sentinel and Jamaican creole pigs augmented the national stock from an official figure of zero in 1982 to about 500,000 by 1989. Many analysts noted, however, that ASF and the pig slaughter had further impoverished already struggling peasants. The disaster forced many children to quit school. Small farmers mortgaged their land; others cut down trees for cash income from charcoal. The loss of the creole pigs to ASF undoubtedly increased the hardships of the rural population, and it may well have fueled to some degree the popular revolt that forced Jean-Claude Duvalier from power. Goats were one of the most plentiful farm animals in Haiti. Like the creole pigs, they were well adapted to the rugged terrain and sparse vegetation. Approximately 54 percent of all farmers owned goats; the total had climbed from 400,000 in 1981 to more than 1 million by the late 1980s. Peasants owned the majority of the country's estimated 1 million head of cattle in 1987; about 48 percent of the farmers owned at least one head of cattle. Until 1985 the primary export market for beef cattle was the American baby food industry. Farmers raised sheep in some areas, but these animals were not particularly well adapted to the country's climate. Chickens, ducks, turkeys, and guinea hens were raised throughout Haiti under little supervision, although one medium-sized hatchery raised chickens for domestic consumption. After the swine-flu epidemic and the subsequent slaughter of pigs, chicken replaced pork as the most widely consumed meat in the Haitian diet.

Memorial to Harry Verelst in St Mary's Church, Minster-in-Thanet, Kent  Career  According to one source, Verelst came to Bengal in the service of the Company as early as 1749. Prior to the Battle of Plassey, he was taken prisoner by the ruler of Bengal Nawab Sirajuddowla. In June 1757, the Nawab was defeated at Plassey by the forces of Robert Clive, the event that marks the beginning of colonial rule in Bengal. Verelst was released from captivity once the battle was over. He served as a factor in Lakshmipur, and thereafter, in spite of his youth, he continued to achieve positions of responsibility. In 1758, he became a member of the Fort William Council. Two years later, he was sent to take control of the southern port of Chittagong, which had been ceded by the local ruler Mir Qasim. Verelst ruled Chittagong for the next five years. His success in increasing tax revenues during this period was rewarded with further postings to Burdwan and Midnapur. In 1767, Robert Clive quit the governorship of Bengal. On 17 May of that year, the Company's Court of Directors chose Harry Verelst to replace him in Fort William. Verelst would occupy the post for the next two and a half years, until his resignation in December 1769. John Cartier was his successor.

The committee included The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (or his deputy), FBI Director William H. Webster, Attorney General Edwin Meese III and other top cabinet officials. The action officer for the project was Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, who then worked at the National Security Council under retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel Robert McFarlane. Background On June 30, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed Presidential Directive 58 (PD-58), which directed the establishment of a Joint Program Office to provide Continuity of Government for the Presidency.https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/assets/documents/pd58.pdf Organization =Disaster preparedness= The FBI played a critical role in Project 908: selection and analysis of locations throughout the United States for use during and after a crisis.Scribd: FBI Memo, 18 May 1984 Agreements were made with various businesses for leasing of space and resources (i.e. power and water) for use by the U.S. government during the crisis period.Scribd: FBI memo, 5 Aug 1987 =Survivable communications= Most of the money was used to design and build relocatable communications vans that would be activated if there was a threat of nuclear war. The rationale for relocatable vans was that the National Military Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon and the Alternate National Military Command Center (ANMCC) located in the Raven Rock Mountain Complex were already targeted by the Soviet Union and therefore would not survive a nuclear strike. The same criticism could not be leveled at the Boeing E-4 aircraft that made up the National Emergency Airborne Command Posts (NEACP), but the plan for relocatable communications vans went forward nevertheless. The government agency that was the strongest advocate for relocatable vans was the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), since renamed the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), whose responsibility it was to plan for continuity of military communications despite the possible loss of both land and satellite-based links. This necessitated the development of alternatives that would be independent of both landlines and land-based radio systems, and also satellites, all of which were thought to be possibly subject to destruction or impairment in an all-out war. The alternatives needed to be capable of being relocated, perhaps frequently, and set up rapidly in a new location when necessary. Since the facts of nuclear warfare also seemed to indicate that High Frequency (HF) Radio propagation might be disturbed by unfamiliar nuclear effects, this led to the consideration of exotic technologies such as troposcatter and meteor burst communication links. Such systems, while effective, used relatively small antennas and could indeed be transported efficiently and economically in relocatable vans. =Facilities= The Federal Reserve established Mount Pony under the NPO where billions of dollars in currency was stored in a hardened bunker. The cash was to be used to restart the economy east of the Mississippi River in case of a nuclear war. The facility also housed the central switching center for the Federal Reserve's Fedwire system until 1988 when all money was removed, switching was decentralized, and the site deactivated as an NPO facility. Cover The NPO was organized in the mid-1980s under a retired Army Lieutenant General, and funded in an initial amount of $2.7 billion in so-called black money. The NPO set up offices at 400 Army-Navy Drive in the Crystal City section of Arlington, Virginia. The NPO recruited communications specialists and retired military officers to do staff work. It was known as the Defense Mobilization Systems Planning Activity (DMSPA), a cover organization. A special security compartment named CHALIS was established for classified documents, which were distributed with a yellow stripe down the right border. Disestablishment President Bill Clinton attempted to dismantle the NPO during his tenure in the White House; he cancelled Project 908 and declassified it. However, those efforts proved incomplete when the legacy NPO plan for Continuity of Government was briefly activated by President George W. Bush on September 11, 2001, in response to the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, DC. The relocatable communications vans that had already been built were put under the command of the U. S. Army's 11th Signal Brigade at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

Deforestation in Haiti is a severe but complex and often misunderstood environmental problem. Haitians produce and consume charcoal as their primary source of domestic energy.  Dynamics and impact  The rapid deforestation of Haiti began during the colonial period facilitated by slavery of captive Africans, and was intensified when coffee was introduced in 1730. Upland forests were cleared and fifty years later, a quarter of the colony's land was under coffee. The system of plantation monoculture and clean -cultivation between rows of coffee, indigo, tobacco, and sugarcane exhausted soil nutrients and led to rapid erosion Following the Haitian revolution, the government was forced to export timber throughout the 19th century to pay off a 90 million franc indemnity to France for the \\"loss\\" equivalent to the 'value' of the formerly enslaved population. The timber installments had to be made for over a century to cover the original amount plus interest. Though no longer under colonial rule, land remained unequally distributed, and most people were granted access only to marginal slopes between 200 and 600m above the fertile plains and below the zones of coffee production. These hillside soils were particularly susceptible to erosion when cleared for farming. Deforestation sped up after Hurricane Hazel drowned trees throughout the island in 1954. Beginning in about 1954, concessionaires stepped up their logging operations in response to Port-au-Prince's intensified demand for charcoal. Deforestation accelerated, which had already become a problem because of environmentally unsound agricultural practices, rapid population growth, and increased competition over land. Techniques that could make forestry more productive for fuel like coppicing and pollarding were not used. = Soil erosion = The most direct effect of deforestation is soil erosion. An estimated of topsoil are washed away each year, with erosion also damaging other productive infrastructure such as dams, irrigation systems, roads, and coastal marine ecosystems.Activity Data Sheet: Haiti – Environmental Degradation Slowed, 521-S002 . USAID FY 2000 Congressional Presentation. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Soil erosion also lowers the productivity of the land, worsens droughts, and eventually leads to desertification, all of which increase the pressure on the remaining land and trees.Malik, Boulos A. \\"Forestry\\".

This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. = Targeting of Dominican Republic forests = Dominican military officials have created a lucrative charcoal trade, and have hired Haitian labor to produce charcoal just over the border. Much of this charcoal is destined for Puerto Rico and the United States mainland, although a small amount crosses over the border into Haiti. Some estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti in 2014, but these estimates are based on incomplete surveys and the numbers are highly contested. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal. Ultimately the uncertainty around how much charcoal is originating from the Dominican Republic will be settled by a nationwide charcoal production and consumption study financed by the World Bank, and due out in late 2018. This study positioned charcoal truck and charcoal boat enumerators along all border entry points, at three different week-long periods throughout the year, 24 hours a day. The counts will be extrapolated to the entire year.  Estimates of forest loss  It has been widely reported that in 1923 over 60% of Haiti's land was forested; the source of this assertion remains unknown but may be linked to the U.S. Marine Occupation in Haiti. In 2006, the country was claimed to have less than 2% forest cover.Country Profile: Haiti. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (May 2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Although significantly deforested, this estimate has been challenged as drastically incorrect due to unsubstantiated research. Nonetheless, the unsubstantiated 2% estimate has been widely circulated in media and in discourse concerning the country. Recent in-depth studies of satellite imagery and environmental analysis regarding forest classification conclude that Haiti has approximately 30% tree cover. Environmental modeling undertaken in 2018 suggests that in a 'business- as-usual' scenario of wood depletion, over the next decade, above-ground woody biomass in Haiti would only decrease by approximately 4% of existing stocks, lending credence to the notion that the issue is vastly misunderstood and exaggerated. Recent research on charcoal production and consumption in Haiti provides the newest data at the national level.  Environmental efforts  Most of Haiti's governments have paid only lip service to the imperative of reforestation. The main impetus to act came from abroad. USAID's Agroforestry Outreach Program, Pwojè Pyebwa, was Haiti's major reforestation program in the 1980s. Peasants planted more than 25 million trees under Projè Pyebwa in its first incarnation. Later efforts to save Haiti's trees focused on intensifying reforestation programs, reducing waste in charcoal production, introducing more wood-efficient stoves, and importing wood under USAID's Food for Peace program. Because most Haitians depend upon wood and charcoal as their primary fuel source, energy alternatives are needed to save the forests. A 15-year Environment Action Plan, authorized in 1999, proposed to stop deforestation by developing alternative fuel sources. Political instability and lack of funding have limited the impact of this reform effort. Several agencies and companies that produce solar cookers as an alternative to using wood and charcoal have been working in Haiti to establish solutions to the poverty and fuel issues, though their effectiveness and the degree to which they are used are questionable.

It is the administrative centre of Borino Municipality.Location of Borino - Falling Rain Genomics Borino is situated in a valley in the Western Rhodope Mountains, at an altitude of . It is a multi-ethnic village with communities of Turks, Bulgarians, Bulgarian-Muslims, and Roma. As a municipal center, Borino includes the villages of Yagodina, Chala, Kozhari, and Buinovo. Nearby places of interest include Yagodinska Cave, Devil's Throat Cave, Trigrad Gorge, and Buynovo Gorge, the Devil’s Bridge, The Old Roman Bridge – Kemera, Videnitsa Peak, and the Kastrakli Nature Reserve. History =Ancient history= The Rhodopes are considered one of the cradles of European civilization. It is estimated that primitive people settled the region around 65,000 to 60,000 BC. The oldest evidence of human presence in the Rhodopes, flint instruments, was discovered in Borino by an archeological excavation near the current Orpheus Chalet. During fall and winter, eneolithic people lived in the caves of the region. Experts have discovered hearths from this time period dating from 4000 to 3000 BC in Yagodina Cave and idyllic figures connected with the cult to the Woman-Mother and the Sun Cult in Haramiska Cave near the Devil's Throat Cave. Two-thousand years ago in the surrounding areas of Borino lived the Thracian tribe of Bessi. From these tribes have been discovered Thracian burial mounds on the Turlata Peak, located near Borino, and many shrines scattered throughout the area. The Shrine of Dionysius in the Rhodopes and the musical culture of the Thracians are connected with the name of the mythological Rhodope singer Orpheus, who fascinated the wind and wild beasts with the sounds of his lyre. He is the creator of the philosophical study Orphism. There exists a hypothesis, that on the Videnitsa Peak was located the famous Shrine of Dionysius – visited by Gaius Octavius and by Alexander the Great. As the Thracian civilization started to fade Roman rule entered the Rhodopes. Near Borino pieces of roads and the bridge Kemera can still be seen from this time. Near Borino ran the direct road from Philipopolis (Plovdiv) to Nicopolis ad Nestum (Gotse Delchev) and Macedonia. =Creation of Bulgaria= During the 6th century the Slavs began to settle the Balkan Peninsula. Following the Slavs, Proto-Bulgarians arrived in the 7th century. These two new tribes, together with the Thracians created the state of Bulgaria in 681 AD. From the Proto-Bulgarians they took the name for the new state, from the Slavs they took the language – Slavic, and from the Thracians their cultural heritage and traditions. At that time each of the three tribes avowed to a different religion. To unify the people of Bulgaria Christianity was declared the state religion in 865 AD and Bulgaria was baptized as a Christian state. However, in the Rhodopes, Christianity has been spreading three centuries before the baptizing of Bulgaria. It is well known that the bible was translated into the language of the Thracians – the Bible Besika. =Karabulak-Borino= In 1396 AD the Rhodopes, like all of Bulgaria, fell under the Turkish yoke. From this period, in the Jumaya Duzu region near Borino, there is a medieval necropolis (graveyard) where the first graves are Christian and later graves are Muslim. Most of Bulgaria was freed from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, however according to the Bulgarian-Turkish agreement of 1886 Borino remained in the Turkish Empire. After the Balkan Wars, in 1912 Borino was finally returned to Bulgaria according to the Treaty of Bucharest (1913). Until 1934, Borino carried the name Karabulak (kara bulak – translated from Turkish which means the \\"black fountain\\"). She arrived in the territory of Borino together with her four sons from the nearby village of Gjovren. Here the brothers started their families in four different places in the valley, thereby creating the four neighborhoods of the village. Unfortunately for the time period before 1934 there are no preserved written records for the naming, development, and history of the village. A large part of this information has been verbally passed down through the generations and preserved in local folklore and culture. =Modern history= The village of Borino In Borino until 1930 the population was exclusively Turkish. After 1930 Bulgarians began to settle in Borino from villages near Smolyan – Sokolovtsi, Gela, Solishta, Stoikite, and others. They bought land from local Turkish families who were emigrating to Turkey. Here they found better conditions for sheep raising and were nearer to their lands on the Aegean Sea (The White Sea, or Бяло море, in Bulgarian) in present-day Greece. After 1945 the village continued to develop with the major priority being infrastructure and social-health structures – school, lyceum, and a new road to the village. In 1960 the village was supplied with electricity. One of the black spots in the most recent history of Borino is, as it was called by the government, the “Regeneration Process,” which began in December 1975 and continued until the beginning of 1990. This process is associated with the forcing of the Turkish and Bulgarian-Muslim minority in Bulgaria to change their names (both first names and family names) to \\"Bulgarian\\" names. In spite of the efforts to violently divide the ethnic groups, toleration as a whole remains. Natural environment In the territory of Borino there are nearly 2,000 recorded plants species. Many of these are of great ecological importance. Of these, 69 are protected species in Bulgaria and 11 are included in the European list of rare and threatened endemic plants. Some of the more interesting are: *Alpine Clematis (Clematis Alpina) – a herbaceous (grassy) perennial with climbing stems, which grows around bushes and coniferous trees. This flower is protected in Bulgaria. *Silivriak (Haberlea rhodopensis) – a perennial flower with dark green leaves and a violet flower which grows limestone rock. Silivriak is a Balkan relict endemic, left over from ancient flora, which withstood the Ice Ages. It can only be found in the Rhodope Mountains and is known as the symbol of the Rhodopes. According to legend, it sprouted from the blood of Orpheus. Silivriak has the unique ability to come back to life if it is put in water even after it has been pressed for years. *Rhodopsko Omayniche (Geum rhodopaeum) grows around damp mountain meadows, with bright orangish red blossoms. It is a Bulgarian regional endemic. *Rhodopsko Lale (Tulipa rhodopea) is found in limey/chalky rocky soil, blooming with large bright red flowers. This flower grows nowhere else in the world except the Rhodopes. In the old growth forests of the Borino Municipality there is an abundance of wild fruits which have thrived for centuries in the Rhodope Mountains – wild blueberries, wild strawberries, raspberries, and rose hips. Also the Borino Municipality is well known for its delicious wild mushrooms – manatarka, maclovka, curnelka, and pachi krak. The Borino area is also home to a wide variety of animals many of which are of national and European significance – brown bears, wolves, wild boars, deer, elk and wild goats. Birds include wood grouse, golden eagles, falcons, kingfishers, and the wallcreeper in the Trigrad Gorge. The average elevation of the region is 1,200 meters, with brown forest soils. The forested land of the Borino Municipality is over 5,280 hectares (13,200 acres) which is predominantly spruce and pine forests. In the region of Kabata, there is one-of-a-kind natural hybrid tree which baffles specialists. The tree is a mix of a pine and spruce tree – the bark of a pine and the needles of a spruce. In the territory of the Borino Municipality is located the nature reserve “Kastrakli.” The reserve is 124 hectares and was created with the purpose to preserve the old growth black pine and natural landscape. The reserve is an extraordinarily beautiful landscape with impressive rock formations, old-growth forests of black pine, Scots pine, and fir, as well as beech, sycamore, hornbeam, and aspen. The average age of the trees is more than 200 years old. The average elevation of the reserve is 1,200 meters. The highest point is 1,291 meters and the lowest 911 meters. The terrain is extremely varied with parts being extremely steep and nearly inaccessible while other areas are gently sloping. The steep and long vertical cliffs are magnificent with their numerous edges and terraces. A wide variety of plant and animal life is located in the reserve. In the Kastrakli reserve there are twenty-five protected plant species, twelve endangered, and eleven categorized as rare. As a whole the natural resources of the region have not been studied extensively. While over 2,000 plant species have been discovered there is most likely many more yet undiscovered, in particular – mushrooms, lichens, and mosses.

Presently in the Kauri Museum in Matakohe The Matakohe block was first settled by Pākehā in 1863, when members of the Albertland religious group arrived in New Zealand. The land was initially burnt off to allow for the planting of crops and grass. A weekly (initially monthly) ferry service brought mail, and a road was constructed to Paparoa. In 1881, the longest wharf in the Kaipara— long—was built at Matakohe to accommodate the steamers. Minnie Casey served Matakohe in the 1880s, and the S.S. Ethel, then the S.S.

Clary Ranch History Clary Ranch was first reported to the University of Nebraska State Museum (UNSM) in 1970. Rancher Oren V. Clary had noticed artifacts, charcoal, and bison remains eroding from the base of a cut bank in Ash Hollow Draw. In 1979, archaeologist Thomas Myers began the first of four consecutive month-long summer field seasons from 1979-1983. Myers was assisted by vertebrate paleontologists R. George Corner and Lloyd G. Tanner. Though much was found, the site was never fully reported on until Matthew G Hill started a comprehensive analysis of the bison remains in 1997. Hill's report was completed several years later and used in his doctoral dissertation from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. From Hill's assessment new questions of the site arose, so a series of field seasons were held between 2001 and 2004. =1979-1982 Excavations= The first excavations of Clary Ranch were led by Myers, Corner, and Tanner, and the crews consisted of volunteer members of the Nebraska Archaeological Society. The excavations averaged 50 1x1 meter units excavated each summer. In the end of the '82 season, a total of approximately 194 m2 had been excavated over two different areas: Area A had 182 m2 excavated, while Area B, which was located 8 m west of the main block, had 12 m2 excavated. It was standard protocol for the excavators to only identify map larger faunal remains, articulated remains, and formal artifacts. Though smaller elements were not mapped, they were collected by unit and level. This meant that minimally each recovered item has a 1 by 1 m excavation unit provenience. From these field seasons, the UNSM collected a bison assemblage of 1966 (NISP) specimen. From these elements, the minimum number of individuals at the site is 41. Though many specimen have been identified, most of the bones are fragmentary with only 15 long bones that were unbroken. This information, coupled with the 247 unidentified long bone shaft fragments, highly suggests that the assemblage was processed for marrow. Based on volumetric data from modern bison, it is estimated that 4.5 gallons of marrow were acquired. This is because almost all long bones (90%) were processed for marrow, no matter how much nutrition they provide. =2001-2004 Excavations= Upon completion of his 1997 faunal analysis, Matt Hill was left with several questions that were currently unanswerable given the data sets. In order to attempt to answer remaining questions, two field sessions totaling 15 days were held using \\"reconnaissance-type investigations Raynolds, R. G., editor, Roaming the Rocky Mountains and Environs: Geological Field Trips Geological Society of America: Field Guide 10 Geological Society of America, Boulder\\" to re-expose past excavations, identify areas of intact sediment, and assess the potential for renewed excavations. The site returned positive results for excavations, so in 2003 an Iowa State University field school was held. The main goal of this field school was to review the recovery methods employed by the UNSM, specifically, if the excavations methods shaped the lithic collections, which was void of microdebitage. The 2003 excavations were located in between 10 previous units, all of which had produced bison remains, but no lithic material. The area was separated into 1x1 m2 units, which were then separated into 16 25x25 cm2 sections and excavated at arbitrary levels of 2 cm2.Raynolds, R. G., editor, Roaming the Rocky Mountains and Environs: Geological Field Trips Geological Society of America: Field Guide 10 Geological Society of America, Boulder One of the most important results of the 2003 excavations was the extraction of collagen from a bison femur shaft fragment that provided the first radiocarbon date for the site, which was 9040 \\\\pm35 years before present.Hill, Matthew G., Late Paleoindian (Allen/Frederick Complex) Subsistence Activities at the Clary Ranch Site, Ash Hollow, Garden County, Nebraska Plains Anthropologist, Vol 50, No 195, pgs 249-263, 2005 Secondly, no chipped stone artifacts were recovered in situ. Thirty-three pieces of microdebitage were recovered using water screening techniques, the largest of which measured 7 millimeters. From this information it was figured that the UNSM excavations were unbiased towards small artifacts. Second, this contrasted UNSM data of areas featuring heavy artifact and debitage clusters, which helps argue for specified use of areas in the site. Using this information, Hill sought to answer even more questions, and in 2004 he returned for another field school with funding from the National Science Foundation.

History Launched in 1995 by Carey Earle, Tom Livaccari and Dan Pelson, Word Magazine created original stories, interviews, games, applications, music, interactive objects and art, and community spaces. Word published new content daily, and each story was treated as a unique interface design experiment. Word was also a pioneer in the use of online advertising and was the first website to integrate microsites into brand advertising online. It was also one of the first truly web oriented online magazines. Word's editorial team was originally led by Vibe magazine founding editor Jonathan Van Meter and creative director Jaime Levy. Marisa Bowe took over as editor-in-chief prior to the site's June 1995 launch and Yoshi Sodeoka became Creative Director in early 1996. Daron Murphy was a founding senior editor. On launch in 1995 Word Magazine was the first to use music/effects soundtracks to their articles using Real Audio with Kit Krash’s soundtrack for John Bowe’s “Big Wheel” to be the first ever use of music audio streaming on that platform (previously only a baseball game was broadcast). The composer Karthik Swaminathan aka Kit Krash from the Illbient band Byzar continued as Word's in house sound designer and main audio producer to the end of the publication where he provided soundtracks for many of the articles and projects as well as having several online radio stations under the Junk Radio section of the magazine. From 1998, Word featured a chatterbot named Fred the Webmate. In 2000, Streeter, Bowe, Murphy, Rose Kernochan, and John Bowe (author) co-edited a book of interviews, \\"Gig: Americans Talk About Their Jobs,\\" inspired by Studs Terkel's Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do. Also in 2000, Word staff developed the turn-based online strategy game Sissyfight 2000. Word won awards from I.D. Magazine and Print Magazine, among others and was placed in the permanent collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center and the Museum of the Moving Image. Word was originally owned by Icon CMT until its sale in April 1998 to Zapata Corporation. Zapata closed Word.com in August, 2000.

It stars Brian Bonsall as Mikey, a young boy adopted by a family, who turns out to be a violent psychopath. Plot Mikey, a young boy, is setting newspapers on fire in his basement. He blames his younger sister, Beth, when his foster mother, Grace, reprimands him for it. Grace slaps him, and he later yells at Beth, asking her why she did not defend him. He ends up throwing her doll into the pool. When Beth reaches to get it, Mikey jumps up and down on the diving board, causing her to fall into the pool and drown. He goes upstairs to the bathroom, where he overhears Grace taking a bath and telling a friend on the phone that adopting Mikey might have been a mistake. The phone dies, and Grace notices Mikey standing in front of the tub. Startled, she chides him for not knocking before he came in. He accuses Grace and Harold of not loving him anymore, but she denies that, saying they both love him very much. However, Mikey doesn't believe her; he picks up her blow dryer, turns it on, and begins to taunt her. He throws it into the water and she is instantly electrocuted. Mikey goes downstairs and pours marbles onto the floor. When his foster father Harold arrives home, he calmly goes to greet him. They sit and talk for a moment until Harold sees his daughter floating lifelessly in the pool. He rushes towards the door, but slips on the marbles Mikey had laid down earlier. After Harold crashes through the door panel, Mikey proceeds to kill him by beating him in the head with a baseball bat. It is then revealed that Mikey has been taping the murders in secret. Soon after that, the police have arrived to investigate the murders and they finally finds Mikey \\"hiding\\" in a closet. He tells them a man came in and killed his family. A psychiatrist recommends that Mikey be fostered as soon as possible. His foster mother's sister is put forward as a prospective foster carer, but she does not want anything to do with Mikey. She states that he was adopted, and that it was suspected that he was abused by members of his family. Mikey is fostered by Neil and Rachel Trenton, who don't know about Mikey's past. Mikey initially seems an amiable and loving child, asking, \\"Are you going to be my new mommy and daddy?\\" when he first meets the Trentons and exhibiting caring behavior towards his new mother's fish. However, soon Mikey begins to draw pictures of his murders, which his foster parents don't recognize. He also begins to self-mutilate his arm with a thumbtack at school. His teacher notices, and tells his foster parents, who refuse to believe it. Mikey becomes irate when his new mother sells the baby fish he was placed in charge of feeding. He yells that she doesn't really love him and that she's not his real mother, and Neil is not his real father. Another incident occurs shortly after when Mikey walks in on his mother in the bath. He says he was bringing her flowers for being such a great mom, and then sets the flowers down and picks up her curling iron. He tells her he knows that if he threw it in the water, it would electrocute her like an electric chair. She tells him to unplug it and leave. He does so without complaint. Mikey then falls in love with his new best friend, Ben's older sister, Jessie. She, however, is not interested in him as she is 15 years old and is dating a young man named David. One night, after Mikey had slingshot rocks at Jessie's window, David is told to leave. Mikey murders Jessie's cat, Rosie, but makes it look as if David had accidentally killed her. Depressed and angry, Jessie breaks up with David. However, they later get back together; upon Mikey’s discovery of this he tricks Jessie into leaving David alone in the hot tub. Mikey yells at David for killing Rosie and kicks a stereo into the water; David is killed instantly. Once again, Mikey films the murder. The next day, Mikey is allowed to stay home from school. He sits, with Jessie telling her not to be sad because David deserved to die for killing Rosie. Jessie tells him it’s “sick” and Mikey responds, \\"Now you can just love me.\\" She tells Mikey to leave her alone when he tries to embrace her. Suspecting Mikey killed David, Jessie goes to Rachel and tells her something is wrong with Mikey and that she is in danger. Assuming Jessie is simply stressed over David, Rachel politely asks her to leave. Mikey's teacher Shawn, who is also a family friend, discovers the connection between Mikey's previous foster mother and David. She informs Mr. Jenkins, who tells her he will go to with her to talk to the family. He finds a gun in her purse and immediately takes it. Meanwhile, Mikey hears the argument between Rachel and Jessie. Rachel goes upstairs and finds Mikey watching a movie. He tells her he's watching ‘Mikey's Funniest Home Movies’. She realizes that it is the taping of David's murder. Mikey stands, holding a hammer. Rachel demands that Mikey give it to her and he agrees. He pretends to hand it over before smashing her hand. He begins to beat her with the hammer. She pushes him down and says it's over. He continues to beat and she begs \\"no more!\\"; she manages to lock herself in her bedroom. She tries to call for help, but the phone does not work. Mikey smashes through the patio door. He picks up a shard of glass and rushes towards Rachel with it. They both fly off the balcony and are soon discovered by Shawn and Mr. Jenkins. Rachel's throat is slit and Mikey appears to have no pulse. Mr. Jenkins says he will go in and call the police and Shawn says she'll wait. When he goes in, Mikey is still on top of Rachel. He sets his gun on the counter to call the police where unbeknownst to Jenkins, Mikey takes the gun to remove the bullets and replaces it back on the counter. Mr. Jenkins heads back outside when he realizes the phone doesn't work but passes Rachel's body and sees Mikey is no longer there. Mikey comes in with a bow and arrow; Mr. Jenkins tries to shoot, but Mikey took the bullets from the gun. Mikey then shoots him through the heart with an arrow. Shawn comes in and Mikey starts to sling marbles at her with his slingshot. He tells her he really liked her marble game and then proceeds to take a larger than average marble and hit her in the head. She dies instantly. Mikey begins to take all the dead bodies and put them at the dinner table. He also turns all the oven dials on high. His father calls and tells him he'll be home soon. Mikey then showers and goes over to Jessie's house. He asks if Ben is home. She tells him no and to go home. She slams the door and runs upstairs only to be greeted by Mikey who climbed in through his \\"secret\\" way. She tells him to use the front door to leave and locks her door. When she opens the door, Mikey shoots an arrow at her. It misses and hits a picture that once had her and David on it, but Mikey puts a photo of himself in David's place. Hearing his dad's car pull in, Mikey rushes to greet him. Jessie tries to yell from the window, but Neil doesn't hear her and goes inside. Once inside, they chit chat for a moment. Mikey then grabs his dad's arm telling him there's a surprise. His father sees all of the murder victims, Rachel, Shawn and Mr. Jenkins along with a skeleton at the table. Speechless and unable to move, Neil's last vision is that of Mikey lighting a Molotov cocktail and throwing it into the house and the house explodes. Jessie is seen talking to cops who assure her they found the remains of a 10-year-old male. Later, another couple is about meet their adoptive child, Josh, who was found wandering and suffering from complete amnesia. Josh is revealed to be Mikey who faked his death after the explosion incident and again asks, \\"Are you going to be my new mommy and daddy?\\" as the movie ends.

It is one of the stories in the short story collection, The Maker (originally in Spanish El Hacedor), first published in 1960., publication information and text in English at Northwestern University. The story \\"Borges and I\\" is about how Borges does not see himself as a writer. It shows the difference between persona and self. Borges persona is that he is the writer of multiple stories but in this story he hardly sees himself in the story. He is well known for his famous works in literature but that is not who he is. He claims in the story Borges wrote those stories not him. He gives credit to Borges for putting in the work to write the short story. He tries to fight these claims but he always loses to Borges. Everything he tries to do apart from Borges ends up being tied to Borges. Background Borges was born August 24, 1899 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1914 Borges' family moved to Switzerland, where he studied at the Collège de Genève. The family traveled widely in Europe, including stays in Spain. On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals. He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer. In 1955 he was appointed director of the National Public Library (Biblioteca Nacional) and professor of Literature at the University of Buenos Aires. Philosophical implications Borges' story raises many philosophical questions of Self and epistemology. Viewed through the analytic lens of Russell's knowledge by description, the story explores the interesting concept of knowledge of Self by description (as opposed to the more expected knowledge by acquaintance). This is emphasized by the mention of receiving Borges' mail and reading about Borges in a book. Also, the distinction between persona and Self can be interpreted as a distinction between author and writer. The author would be analogous to the persona and Borges. The writer would be the Self and \\"I\\". Theoretically, the writer could be anyone, it just happens to be Borges. With this interpretation Borges is seen to be commenting on the cognitive differences between processing third person information and first person information., Amherst philosophy lecturer John Perry discusses the differences between the two possible interpretations in depth.

Propellant tanks vary in construction, and may be a fuel tank in the case of many aircraft. In rocket vehicles, propellant tanks are fairly sophisticated since weight is on a premium. Rocket propellant tanks Rocket propellant tanks are pressure vessels where liquid fuels are stored prior to use. They have to store the propellant, while minimizing slosh and particularly when the tank is nearly empty, minimizing vortexing. Rocket propellant tanks are often constructed of materials such as aluminium alloys, steels or carbon fibre wound tanks. These kinds of tanks are usually constructed using monocoque construction techniques. Balloon tanks are the most extreme of these, they are held rigid only by internal pressurisation, but are extremely lightweight. Rocket propellant tanks are of many shapes but the optimum shape of a tank is spherical, because for given volume it results in a tank with least weight. Normally, propellant in the tank is stored at a pressure of about 1-4 bar, if the system uses turbopump to deliver high pressure to the combustion chamber. This method reduces the wall thickness and hence the weight of the tank. If the propellant in the tank is stored at very high pressure, then the wall thickness of the tank is increased and hence the weight of the tank. References Rocket Propulsion Elements by George P.

Reymond, A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith (2nd ed., Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1998), 631.) comprises the totality of his actions, which Christians believe was in perfect obedience to the law of God. In Reformed theology, Christ's active obedience is generally believed to be imputed to Christians as part of their justification. The life of Christ Jesus, whom the Bible describes as being \\"without sin\\". In Acts , Peter calls Jesus \\"the Holy and Righteous One\\", while in Peter says that Christ \\"he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.\\" According to the Bible, in Hebrews 4:15, Jesus was \\"without sin\\". Robert L. Reymond interprets Romans (which talks about his \\"one act of righteousness\\") as referring to Christ's \\"entire life work\\", and the references to Christ being a \\"servant\\" as indicating his obedience.Reymond, Systematic Theology, 629. Christ's active obedience (doing what God's law required) is usually distinguished from his passive obedience (suffering for his people), but J. Gresham Machen argues, \\"Every event of his life was a part of his payment of the penalty of sin, and every event of his life was a part of that glorious keeping of the law of God by which he earned for his people the reward of eternal life.\\"J. Gresham Machen, \\"The Active Obedience of Christ,\\" in God Transcendent (Edinburgh: Banner of Truth, 1982), 191. Machen also points out that Jesus was not subject to the law for himself and that \\"no obedience was required of him for himself, since he was Lord of all.\\"Machen, \\"Active Obedience of Christ,\\" 189. Imputation The imputation of Christ's active obedience is a doctrine within Lutheran and Reformed theology. It is based on the idea that God's righteousness demands perfect obedience to his law. By his active obedience, Christ has \\"made available a perfect righteousness before the law that is imputed or reckoned to those who put their trust in him.\\"Reymond, Systematic Theology, 631. The Heidelberg Catechism asserts that God grants to the believer \\"the perfect satisfaction, righteousness and holiness of Christ,\\" so that the Christian can say that it is \\"as if I never had had, nor committed any sin: yea, as if I had fully accomplished all that obedience which Christ has accomplished for me\\" (Q&A; 60). This imputation therefore constitutes the positive element of justification.Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology (London: Banner of Truth, 1941), 515. The imputation of Christ's active obedience has its foundation in the idea of a covenant of works made with Adam, though this has been the subject of debate, since covenantal language is not employed until the Noahic covenant in Genesis 6. Machen argues that \\"if Christ had merely paid the penalty of sin for us and done nothing more we should be at best back in the situation in which Adam found himself when God placed him under the covenant of works.\\"Machen, \\"Active Obedience of Christ,\\" 187. As a result of this, our \\"attainment of eternal life would have been dependent upon our perfect obedience to the law of God,\\" and we would be certain to fall.Machen, \\"Active Obedience of Christ,\\" 188. Machen goes on to say that Christ was \\"our representative both in penalty paying and in probation keeping,\\" and that for those who have been saved by him, the probation is over since \\"Christ has merited for them the reward by his perfect obedience to God's law.\\"Machen, \\"Active Obedience of Christ,\\" 187–188. Criticism =Arminianism= The imputation of Christ's active obedience has usually been denied by Arminians, who, according to Louis Berkhof, argue that justification simply places man \\"in the position of Adam before the fall.\\"Berkhof Systematic Theology, 515. =Calvinism= Some within the Reformed community, particularly writers associated with the Federal Vision theology, have objected to the traditional formulation of this doctrine, because of its basis in the covenant of works and the idea of merit. James B. Jordan argues that the \\"transformation... achieved by Jesus was not something 'earned' like a weekly allowance.\\"James B. Jordan, \\"Merit versus Maturity: What did Jesus do for us?\\" in Steve Wilkins and Duane Garner (eds.), The Federal Vision (Monrone: Athanasius, 2004), 158. What is transferred to the believer is not Jesus' \\"works and merits\\" but his \\"glorified and resurrected life in the Spirit.\\"Jordan, \\"Merit versus Maturity,\\" 195. =New Covenant theology= Some adherents of New Covenant Theology have also been critical of this imputation, on the basis that the sinless life of Christ merely qualified him to be the perfect substitute on behalf of humanity. Christ's keeping of the law proved that he was righteous, rather than making him righteous.Examining the Imputation of the Active Obedience of Christ by Geoff Volker and Steve Lehrer Importance J. Gresham Machen, who declared on his death-bed that there is no hope without the active obedience of Christ. As he lay dying, J. Gresham Machen, the American Presbyterian theologian, sent a final telegram to his friend John Murray containing the words, \\"I'm so thankful for the active obedience of Christ. No hope without it.\\"John Piper, J.

The dish is believed to have been brought to the country by Sri Lankan Malays in the 18th century, who moved from Indonesia to the country during Dutch rule. The name, watalappam, could be a corruption of the Tamil words Vattil (cup) and Appam (cake), hence Vatillappam (cup cake). The dish however was originally unknown to the Tamil population. It is more likely that the dessert is derived from a Malay dish known as serikaya, which is a steamed custard made from eggs, coconut milk, palm sugar and pandan or screwpine leaves. The similarity between the two dishes suggests a common origin. It is likely that it is a word borrowed from the Dutch, Vla, which means a custard, and was applied by the Moors as a vernacular name, vattil-appan, using the Tamil phrasing. The dessert has come to be strongly identified with Sri Lanka's Muslim community and is a part of a traditional Eid al-Fitr celebrations, marking the end of Ramadan.

During the Malt Tax riots in Glasgow, soon to be bookseller Andrew Millar (then still an apprentice), directly challenged Drummond's authority by printing opposition material in Leith, outside the council of Edinburgh's jurisdiction. Drummond was a strong opponent of Jacobitism, and fought against John Erskine, the Earl of Mar, at the Battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715. He also raised a company of volunteers to try to defend the city of Edinburgh against the army of Bonnie Prince Charlie during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Drummond first joined the Edinburgh Town Council in 1716. He raised funds to build the Royal Infirmary, designed by William Adam in 1738, which quickly became one of the world's foremost teaching hospitals. In 1760 he was responsible for commissioning the Royal Exchange, which later became the Edinburgh City Chambers. He was also a great supporter of the University of Edinburgh, encouraging its enlargement and establishing five chairs of medicine. Memorial tablet over Drummond's grave Drummond is best known as the driving force behind the building of Edinburgh's 'New Town'. His aim was to overcome the unhealthy and overcrowded conditions of the Old Town. In 1766 he persuaded the Town Council to support an ambitious plan for a grand extension to the city on its north side and to hold a competition for the design. The competition was won by the young architect James Craig who was then only 21. In 1759 Drummond also had the insanitary Nor' Loch drained and identified the need for the North Bridge as the gateway to the New Town, laying its foundation stone in 1763. Drummond was also a Freemason. He was Initiated into Freemasonry in The Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No.1, in 1721 and in 1739 became the Founder Master of Lodge Drummond Kilwinning from Greenock (now dormant). He served as Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Scotland From November 1752 to November 1753.Year Book of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. 1968. pp 93-97 In 1722 Drummond was Initiated as a Free Gardener in the Free Gardener's Lodge at Dunfermline.Robert L.D.

In 1968 the first american magnet school was created in Tacoma, Washington. In 1989 the second magnet school, the Trotter Elementary School, was established in Boston. In 1970 four magnet elementary school with different curriculum focus were opened in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In the 1980s, Magnet Schools of America (MSA) was organized as a for-profit organization, incorporated in the State of Texas, sponsoring conferences. In the early 1990s, a small group of magnet leaders met and organized an Association of members. In 1994, MSA was approved by the IRS as a 501(c) 3 not-for profit, professional educational association. Originally located in Houston, TX, MSA relocated its office to Washington, D.C. in 2000. The current executive director of the Magnet Schools of America is Todd Mann.Magnet Schools of America - Content Dr. Michelle Frazier is the former President and Elementary Magnet Schools Coordinator for the Office of Curriculum and Instruction of the Chicago Public Schools. She was replaced by Susan King. Today, MSA sponsors programs, events, technical assistance, student scholarships, professional development, and leadership through the National Institute for Magnet School Leadership (NIMSL). Purpose The Magnet Schools of America (MSA) was formed to support magnet schools throughout the United States by means of goals such as desegregation, having businesses become actively involved in magnet schools, prompting federal financing, supporting legislation that supports magnet schools and to provide information to people of the benefits of magnet schools. Awards =Magnet Schools of Merit Awards= Magnet Schools of America established the Magnet Schools of Merit Award to recognize the top magnet schools in the United States. The Magnet Schools of Merit Award recognizes magnet schools that show commitment to high academic standards, curriculum innovation, successful desegregation/diversity efforts, and the consistent delivery of quality services to all stakeholders. Two categories of awards have been established by MSA:The top category, awarded to a group of select magnet schools, is the Magnet School of Excellence Award. The second category of awards is the Magnet School of Distinction Award. Schools recognized must be members of Magnet School of America and must submit an application that is scored by a panel of educators. Dr. Ronald P. Simpson Distinguished Merit Awards This award is considered the top award for magnet schools in the nation, and is given to only one school in the Magnet School of Excellence category. The award recognizes the work of Dr. Ronald P. Simpson, one of the founding Members of the Magnet Schools of America (MSA). Dr. Simpson, from Kansas City, Missouri Public School System, served as the second president from 1994–1995. Dr. Simpson made a positive impact on magnet schools, and this award was established to commemorate his outstanding contributions to Magnet Schools of America. The Dr.Ronald P. Simpson Distinguished Merit Award includes a $5,000 cash award presented to the winning school. =Other awards= In 2006, Magnet Schools of America established two new awards for elementary and secondary Magnet Schools of Excellence, both with a cash award of $2,500. The elementary Magnet Schools of Excellence award is sponsored by Magnet Schools of America, and named after Dr. Donald Waldrip, founder and MSA's first Executive Director. Also established in 2006, is the Hogan Lovells Award to recognize New and Emerging Magnet Schools of Merit from the Schools of Excellence category. Recognized nationally for its leadership and commitment to magnet schools across the nation, the Washington, D.C. Law Firm of Hogan Lovells is the sponsor of a $1,000 cash award. =Individual Awards Programs= Magnet Principal of-the-Year, was established in 2009. The awards recognizes an outstanding school leader who has succeeded in providing innovative programs that promote equity, diversity, and academic excellence for students in Magnet Schools.

Early life Born in Cape Town, son of jazz musician Issy Ariefdien, he grew up in Elsie's cape on the Cape Flats, but spent most of his earlier years travelling various parts of South Africa with his father. Career The Sugarhill Gang's \\"Rappers Delight\\" had a big influence on him, and Ariefdien ranks today as one of the most talented rappers or MCs in South Africa. He gained recognition at The BASE (legendary club which featured Saturday afternoon hip-hop jams), with his supremacy in freestyle battles. He is credited with having set the standards with rap styles, skills, and lyrical content in Cape Town. As an MC, he is almost unsurpassed in South Africa, while his production skills are dominant on all of POC's releases to date. He has also made his mark on hip-hop history in South Africa, as he was one of the key members who were responsible for setting up the African Hip Hop Movement, and still concentrates on development in the hip-hop community. He has always been politically and socially conscious, which stems from his school days when he was a member of the Student's Representative Council and was actively involved in protests at school. He brought an air of political awareness and criticism to his lyrics, and has been understandably harsh on the old Apartheid government.

So something that cannot be seen with one telescope might be visible with two or more telescopes. Background Interferometry is the process of combining waves in such a way that they constructively interfere. When two or more independent sources detect a signal at the same given frequency those signals can be combined and the result is better than each one individually. An overview of Astronomical interferometers and a History of astronomical interferometry can be referenced from their respective pages. The NASA Origins Program was created in the 1990s to ultimately search for the origin of the universe. The theory that the Origins Program is based on is: since light travels at a constant speed until it is absorbed by something; there is still light that was part of the first light ever created traveling about the universe and ultimately some of that light is coming in the general direction of Earth. So a satellite system capable of collecting light from the beginning of the universe would be able to tell us more about where we came from. There is also the constant search for life in other worlds. A satellite system using the interferometric technologies mentioned above would be able to have a much higher resolution than any of the current deep space imaging systems. A space systems also reduces the amount of interference due to lack of an atmosphere. Future Terrestrial Planet Finder conceptual image by T. Herbst NASA is currently focused on the Vision for Space Exploration and has reduced current funding for scientific unmanned space exploration in favor of human exploration. These budget cuts have slowed the multiple satellite imaging development but it continues. While Project Prometheus and other scientific missions have ended other projects such as Terrestrial Planet Finder continue.

He served in the New York State Assembly and the state Constitutional Convention and achieved the most political success of any Roosevelt before Theodore Roosevelt. Isaac was the patrilineal great-great- grandfather of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was the second generation of what would later come to be known as the Hyde Park, New York branch of the extended Roosevelt family. Isaac's fortune from sugar refining, and his political accomplishments, became an essential root of the substantial wealth, prominence and influence that the Hyde Park Roosevelts came to amass. Early life Roosevelt was born in New York City and baptized in the Reformed Dutch Church of New York. He was the sixth son of Jacobus Roosevelt (1692–1776) and Catharina Hardenbroek, who wed in 1713. His siblings were Johannes (b. 1714), Johannes (b. 1715), Nicholas (b. 1717), Helena (1719–1772), Jacobus (b. 1721), Christoffel (b. 1724), Abraham (b. 1729), Sara (b. 1730), and Adolphus Roosevelt (b. 1735). His paternal grandfather was Nicholas Roosevelt (1658–1742) and his great-grandfather was the Dutch immigrant Claes Maartenszen Van Rosenvelt (d. 1659), who established the Roosevelt family in America. His maternal grandparents were Johannes Hardenbroek and Sarah (née Van Laer) Hardenbroek. Career The Walton Mansion housed the Bank of New York from 1784 to 1787. Isaac Roosevelt was one of the first large-scale sugar refiners in New York City. During the 1700s, sugar was Europe's most valuable traded agricultural commodity, and it was cultivated almost entirely by slave labor in the Caribbean https://www.livescience.com/4949-sugar-changed-world.html. Sugar cultivation also entailed an especially high death rate among slaves, due to difficult conditions and disease. During that time, slavery remained legal in New York, and New York City became a center of sugar refining and of the global sugar trade: Roosevelt built one of the first sugar refineries in the city, and originally had his store on Wall Street, later removing to St. George's Square. Active in the community, he was one of the first members of the New York City Chamber of Commerce, organized in 1768, and he was one of the original incorporators of the first public hospital in New York in 1770. In 1784, he was a cofounder of the Bank of New York, one of the oldest banks in America.The Bank of New York operated under that name continuously for over 220 years before merging with Mellon Financial in 2007 to form BNY Mellon. In 1786, he succeeded fellow founder Alexander Hamilton to become the bank's second president, a post he held until 1791. Roosevelt was succeeded by Gulian Verplanck, Speaker of the New York State Assembly. =Political office= A noted patriot, he was elected to the New York Provincial Congress on April 22, 1775. He was one of the Committee of One Hundred that took control of the state government in May 1775. Though he felt no allegiance to England, he was initially a moderate, hoping to prevent conflict. However, he withdrew from New York when the British occupied the city, and spent the period of occupation at his wife's home in Dutchess County, serving with the Sixth Regiment of the Dutchess County Militia. After the war, as one of ten representatives from New York City (among John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and Robert R. Livingston), he took part in the New York State Convention at Poughkeepsie on June 18, 1788 that deliberated on the adoption of the United States Constitution. He was a member of the New York State Senate (Southern District) from 1777 to 1786, and from 1788 to 1792. Personal life On September 22, 1752, he married Cornelia Hoffman (1734–1780), daughter of Tryntje (née Benson) (1712–1765) and Martinus Hoffman (1706–1772), a prominent Dutchess County landowner and member of the Hoffman family. She was the sister of Anthony Hoffman (1739–1790) and the aunt of Josiah Ogden Hoffman (1766–1837). After her mother's death, Cornelia's father Martinus, married Alida Livingston Hansen, a member of the Livingston family who was the widow of Henry Hansen and younger sister of Philip Livingston, a signor of the Declaration of Independence. Together, Isaac and Cornelia had ten children: * Abraham Roosevelt (b. 1753), who died young * Martinus Roosevelt (b. 1754), who died young * Catharine Roosevelt (b. 1756), who died unmarried * Sarah Roosevelt (b. 1758), who died unmarried * Jacobus \\"James\\" Roosevelt III (1760–1847), who married Maria Eliza Walton (1769-1810), then Catharine Elizabeth Barclay (c. 1783-1816), then Harriet Howland (1784-1856). * Cornelia Roosevelt (b. 1761), who died young * Maria Roosevelt (b. 1763), who married Richard Varick (1753–1831), a Mayor of New York City. * Martin Roosevelt (1765–1781), who died at College. * Cornelia Roosevelt (1767–1818), who married Dr. Benjamin Kissam (1759–1803) on January 10, 1786. * Helen Roosevelt (b. 1768), who died unmarried.

The Kern River Oil Field covers an area of in a rough oval extending over the low hills north- northeast of Bakersfield, hills which are now almost completely barren except for oil rigs, drilling pads and associated equipment. This area is the densest operational oil development in the state of California: Midway-Sunset, which has more wells, is almost three times as large in surface area, for a lower overall density. Elevations on the Kern River Oil Field range from approximately , rising towards the northeast, and the Kern River flows south of the field, from east to west, from the Sierra Nevada into the city of Bakersfield. The oil field is one of many contiguous oil fields along the eastern edge of the southern San Joaquin Valley, lying between the Kern Front field to the northwest and the Kern Bluff field to the southeast, on the other side of the Kern River. Directly north of the Kern River field is the large Mount Poso Oil Field, entirely in the Sierra foothills, and to the northeast is the Round Mountain Oil Field. Geology Kern River Oil Field Geologic Cross Section Unlike some of the other Kern County oil fields which contain numerous pools, the Kern River field has one large pool, named for the field itself (the Kern River) and two smaller pools, the Vedder and Jewett, discovered in 1981 and 1985 respectively. The formation containing the Kern River pool is of Pliocene-Pleistocene age, and lies below ground surface; the Vedder and Jewett are of Oligocene and Miocene ages, respectively, with depths of .The Jewett pool was abandoned in 1987.

On June 1, 1899, feet to the north, Horace and Milton McWhorter drilled this region's first commercial well.\\" The current operator of the Kern River Field is Chevron, who has gradually acquired the field through buyout and merger with the various other operators, including Tidewater, one of the original developers of the enhanced production technologies that revived the field in the 1960s; Getty Oil; and Texaco. While most of the oil has been removed from the field, enhanced production technologies such as steam flooding have made it possible to extract much of the oil once considered unfeasible to recover. A high price of oil also makes recovery of previously marginal pools attractive. Total estimated reserves of the Kern River field at the end of 2006 totaled more than , which represented approximately 15% of California's reserve.California Department of Conservation, Oil and Gas Statistics, Annual Report, December 31, 2006, p. 2 Annual oil production from the field was as of 2012. Wastewater from the field was once allowed to drain directly into the streams dissecting the region, and thence into the Kern River. This practice ended in the 1960s and 1970s when more stringent environmental regulations were enacted both on federal and state levels. Wastewater now is treated in facilities specifically built for this purpose, and after the treatment, is used to irrigate crops in the San Joaquin Valley.Kern River Field at 100 : article in the Bakersfield Californian on the history of the Kern River Oil Field References *On-site California Historical Marker . * California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III.

Since the 16th century, fishing vessels have been able to cross oceans in pursuit of fish, and since the 19th century it has been possible to use larger vessels and in some cases process the fish on board. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. The term fishing may be applied to catching other aquatic animals such as shellfish, cephalopods, crustaceans and echinoderms. The term is not usually applied to catching aquatic mammals, such as whales, where the term whaling is more appropriate, or to farmed fish. In addition to providing food, modern fishing is also a recreational sport. According to FAO statistics, the total number of fishermen and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. Fisheries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people.Fisheries and Aquaculture in our Changing Climate Policy brief of the FAO for the UNFCCC COP-15 in Copenhagen, December 2009. In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms, with an additional 7.4 kilograms harvested from fish farms.FAO: Fisheries and Aquaculture Prehistory Stone Age fish hook made from bone.

Archaeological features such as shell middens,Coastal Shell Middens and Agricultural Origasims in Atlantic Europe. discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food. Spearfishing with barbed poles (harpoons) was widespread in palaeolithic times.Guthrie, Dale Guthrie (2005) The Nature of Paleolithic Art. Page 298. University of Chicago Press. Cosquer cave in Southern France contains cave art over 16,000 years old, including drawings of seals which appear to have been harpooned. The Neolithic culture and technology spread worldwide between 4,000 and 8,000 years ago. With the new technologies of farming and pottery came basic forms of the main fishing methods that are still used today. From 7500 to 3000 years ago, Native Americans of the California coast were known to engage in fishing with gorge hook and line tackle.King 1991, pp. 80-81. In addition, some tribes are known to have used plant toxins to induce torpor in stream fish to enable their capture.Rostlund 1952, pp. 188-190 Copper harpoons were known to the seafaring HarappansRay 2003, page 93 well into antiquity.Allchin 1975, page 106 Early hunters in India include the Mincopie people, aboriginal inhabitants of India's Andaman and Nicobar islands, who have used harpoons with long cords for fishing since early times.Edgerton 2003, page 74 Early history Egyptians bringing in fish, and splitting for salting. Villa of the Nile Mosaic, Lepcis Magna, Tripoli National Museum, circa 1st century CE. The ancient river Nile was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food for much of the population.. The Egyptians invented various implements and methods for fishing and these are clearly illustrated in tomb scenes, drawings, and papyrus documents. Simple reed boats served for fishing. Woven nets, weir baskets made from willow branches, harpoons and hook and line (the hooks having a length of between eight millimetres and eighteen centimetres) were all being used. By the 12th dynasty, metal hooks with barbs were being used. As is fairly common today, the fish were clubbed to death after capture. Nile perch, catfish and eels were among the most important fish. Some representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime. Fishing with nets, Tacuinum Sanitatis casanatensis (14th century) There are numerous references to fishing in ancient literature; in most cases, however, the descriptions of nets and fishing-gear do not go into detail, and the equipment is described in general terms. An early example from the Bible in Job 41:7: Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? Unlike in Minoan culture,The Minoan Culture, historywiz.com Accessed 2015-12-28 fishing scenes are rarely represented in ancient Greek culture, a reflection of the low social status of fishing. There is a wine cup, dating from c. 500 BC, that shows a boy crouched on a rock with a fishing-rod in his right hand and a basket in his left. In the water below there is a rounded object of the same material with an opening on the top. This has been identified as a fish-cage used for keeping live fish, or as a fish-trap. It is clearly not a net. This object is currently in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.Image of an ancient angler on a wine cup. Oppian of Corycus, a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the Halieulica or Halieutika, composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived intact to the modern day. Oppian describes various means of fishing including the use of nets cast from boats, scoop nets held open by a hoop, spears and tridents, and various traps \\"which work while their masters sleep\\". Oppian's description of fishing with a \\"motionless\\" net is also very interesting: : The fishers set up very light nets of buoyant flax and wheel in a circle round about while they violently strike the surface of the sea with their oars and make a din with sweeping blow of poles. At the flashing of the swift oars and the noise the fish bound in terror and rush into the bosom of the net which stands at rest, thinking it to be a shelter: foolish fishes which, frightened by a noise, enter the gates of doom. Then the fishers on either side hasten with the ropes to draw the net ashore. Dutch fishermen using tridents in the 17th century The Greek historian Polybius (ca 203 BC–120 BC), in his Histories, describes hunting for swordfish by using a harpoon with a barbed and detachable head.Polybius, \\"Fishing for Swordfish\\", Histories Book 34.3 (Evelyn S. Shuckburgh, translator). London, New York: Macmillan, 1889. Reprint Bloomington, 1962. Pictorial evidence of Roman fishing comes from mosaics which show fishing from boats with rod and line as well as nets. Various species such as conger, lobster, sea urchin, octopus and cuttlefish are illustrated.Image of fishing illustrated in a Roman mosaic . In a parody of fishing, a type of gladiator called retiarius was armed with a trident and a casting-net. He would fight against the murmillo, who carried a short sword and a helmet with the image of a fish on the front. The Greco-Roman sea god Neptune is depicted as wielding a fishing trident. Pearl fishery at Tuticorin camp of paravar, 1662, by Johan Nieuhof. In India, the Pandyas, a classical Dravidian Tamil kingdom, were known for the pearl fishery as early as the 1st century BC. Their seaport Tuticorin was known for deep sea pearl fishing. The paravas, a Tamil caste centred in Tuticorin, developed a rich community because of their pearl trade, navigation knowledge and fisheries. In Norse mythology the sea giantess Rán uses a fishing net to trap lost sailors. The Moche people of ancient Peru depicted fisherman in their ceramics.Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997. From ancient representations and literature it is clear that fishing boats were typically small, lacking a mast or sail, and were only used close to the shore. In traditional Chinese history, history begins with three semi-mystical and legendary individuals who taught the Chinese the arts of civilization around 2800–2600 BC: of these Fuxi was reputed to be the inventor of writing, hunting, trapping, and fishing.

The Sea of Galilee and Its Fishermen in the New Testament, pp. 28-44. Kibbutz Ein Gev, Kinnereth Sailing Co. In North America, aboriginal fishermen used cedar canoes and natural fibre nets, e.g., made with nettels or the inner bark of cedar.Stewart, Hilary (1994). Indian Fishing: Early Methods on the Northwest Coast. Seattle, University of Washington Press. They would attach stones to the bottom of the nets as weights, and pieces of wood to the top, to use as floats. This allowed the net to suspend straight up and down in the water. Each net would be suspended either from shore or between two boats. Native fishers in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska still commonly use gillnets in their fisheries for salmon and steelhead. Both drift gillnets and setnets also have been widely adapted in cultures around the world. The antiquity of gillnet technology is documented by a number of sources from many countries and cultures. Japanese records trace fisheries exploitation, including gillnetting, for over 3,000 years. Many relevant details are available concerning the Edo period (1603–1867).Ruddle, Kenneth and Akimich, Tomoya. “Sea Tenure in Japan and the Southwestern Ryukyus,” in Cordell, John, Ed. (1989), A Sea of Small Boats, pp. 337-370. Cambridge, Mass., Cultural Survival, Inc. Fisheries in the Shetland Islands, which were settled by Norsemen during the Viking era, share cultural and technological similarities with Norwegian fisheries, including gillnet fisheries for herring.Goodlad, C.A. (1970). Shetland Fishing Saga, pp. 59-60. The Shetland Times, Ltd. Many of the Norwegian immigrant fishermen who came to fish in the great Columbia River salmon fishery during the second half of the 19th century did so because they had experience in the gillnet fishery for cod in the waters surrounding the Lofoten Islands of northern Norway.Martin, Irene (1994). Legacy and Testament: The Story of the Columbia River Gillnetter, p. 38. Pullman, Washington State University Press. Gillnets were used as part of the seasonal round by Swedish fishermen as well.Lofgen, Ovar. “Marine Ecotypes in Preindustrial Sweden: A Comparative Discussion of Swedish Peasant Fishermen,” in Andersen, Raoul, ed., North Atlantic Maritime Cultures, pp. 83-109. The Hague, Mouton. Welsh and English fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in the rivers of Wales and England in coracles, using hand-made nets, for at least several centuries.Jenkins, J. Geraint (1974). Nets and Coracles, p. 68. London, David and Charles. These are but a few of the examples of historic gillnet fisheries around the world. Nowadays Gillnets are not used in modern fisheries due to the new regulations and laws put on the commercial fishing industry. The Gillnets would not only kill targeted fish but also harm other unintended inhabitants of the surrounding area, also known as bycatch. =Cod trade= Stockfish One of the world's longest lasting trade histories is the trade of dry cod from the Lofoten area to the southern parts of Europe, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The trade in cod started during the Viking period or before, has been going on for more than 1000 years and is still important. Cod has been an important economic commodity in an international market since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians used dried cod during their travels and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1000 years, passing through periods of Black Death, wars and other crises and still is an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese have been fishing cod in the North Atlantic since the 15th century, and clipfish is widely eaten and appreciated in Portugal. The Basques also played an important role in the cod trade and are believed to have found the Canadian fishing banks in the 16th century. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast amount of cod, and many cities in the New England area spawned near cod fishing grounds. Portland Dock, Maine, c. 1908. Apart from the long history this particular trade also differs from most other trade of fish by the location of the fishing grounds, far from large populations and without any domestic market. The large cod fisheries along the coast of North Norway (and in particular close to the Lofoten islands) have been developed almost uniquely for export, depending on sea transport of stockfish over large distances. Since the introduction of salt, dried salt cod ('klippfisk' in Norwegian) has also been exported. The trade operations and the sea transport were by the end of the 14th century taken over by the Hanseatic League, Bergen being the most important port of trade. William Pitt the Elder, criticizing the Treaty of Paris in Parliament, claimed that cod was \\"British gold\\"; and that it was folly to restore Newfoundland fishing rights to the French. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the New World, especially in Massachusetts and Newfoundland, cod became a major commodity, forming trade networks and cross-cultural exchanges. Modern trawling =Early modern designs= Herring Buss taking aboard its drift net (G. Groenewegen) In the 15th century, the Nut developed a type of seagoing herring drifter that became a blueprint for European fishing boats. This was the Herring Buss, used by Dutch herring fishermen until the early 19th centuries. The ship type buss has a long history. It was known around 1000 AD in Scandinavia as a bǘza, a robust variant of the Viking longship. The first herring buss was probably built in Hoorn around 1415. The last one was built in Vlaardingen in 1841. The ship was about 20 metres long and displaced between 60 and 100 tons. It was a massive round-bilged keel ship with a bluff bow and stern, the latter relatively high, and with a gallery. The busses used long drifting gill nets to catch the herring. The nets would be retrieved at night and the crews of eighteen to thirty menDe Vries & Woude (1977), pages 244–245 would set to gibbing, salting and barrelling the catch on the broad deck. The ships sailed in fleets of 400 to 500 ships to the Dogger Bank fishing grounds and the Shetland isles. They were usually escorted by naval vessels, because the English considered they were \\"poaching\\". The fleet would stay at sea for weeks at a time. The catch would sometimes be transferred to special ships (called ventjagers), and taken home while the fleet would still be at sea (the picture shows a ventjager in the distance). dogger viewed from before the port beam. c. 1675 by Willem van de Velde the Younger During the 17th century, the British developed the dogger, an early type of sailing trawler or longliner, which commonly operated in the North Sea. The dogger takes its name from the Dutch word dogger, meaning a fishing vessel which tows a trawl. Dutch trawling boats were common in the North Sea, and the word dogger was given to the area where they often fished, which became known as the Dogger Bank.Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, p. 256 Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.Fagan 2008 Like the herring buss, they were wide-beamed and bluff-bowed, but considerably smaller, about 15 metres long, a maximum beam of 4.5 metres, a draught of 1.5 metres, and displacing about 13 tonnes. They could carry a tonne of bait, three tonnes of salt, half a tonne each of food and firewood for the crew, and return with six tonnes of fish. Decked areas forward and aft probably provided accommodation, storage and a cooking area. An anchor would have allowed extended periods fishing in the same spot, in waters up to 18 metres deep. The dogger would also have carried a small open boat for maintaining lines and rowing ashore. A banks dory used for cod fishing from the Gazela A precursor to the dory type was the early French bateau type, a flat bottom boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the Saint Lawrence River.Gardner 1987, page 18 The common coastal boat of the time was the wherry and the merging of the wherry design with the simplified flat bottom of the bateau resulted in the birth of the dory. Anecdotal evidence exists of much older precursors throughout Europe. England, France, Italy, and Belgium have small boats from medieval periods that could reasonably be construed as predecessors of the Dory.Gardner 1987, page 15 Dories appeared in New England fishing towns sometime after the early 18th century.Chapelle, page 85 They were small, shallow-draft boats, usually about five to seven metres (15 to 22 feet) long. Lightweight and versatile, with high sides, a flat bottom and sharp bows, they were easy and cheap to build. The Banks dories appeared in the 1830s. They were designed to be carried on mother ships and used for fishing cod at the Grand Banks. Adapted almost directly from the low freeboard, French river bateaus, with their straight sides and removable thwarts, bank dories could be nested inside each other and stored on the decks of fishing schooners, such as the Gazela Primeiro, for their trip to the Grand Banks fishing grounds. =Modern fishing trawler= Painting of a Brixham trawler by William Adolphus Knell. The painting is now in the National Maritime Museum. The British dogger was an early type of sailing trawler from the 17th century, but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'. This revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as Scarborough, Hull, Grimsby, Harwich and Yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean. smack near Brightlingsea. The small village of Grimsby grew to become the 'largest fishing port in the world'Days out: “Gone fishing in Grimsby” The Independent, 8 September 2002 by the mid 19th century. An Act of Parliament was first obtained in 1796, which authorised the construction of new quays and dredging of the Haven to make it deeper. It was only in the 1846, with the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, that the Grimsby Dock Company was formed. The foundation stone for the Royal Dock was laid by Albert the Prince consort in 1849. The dock covered and was formally opened by Queen Victoria in 1854 as the first modern fishing port. The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time - the dock gates and cranes were operated by hydraulic power, and the Grimsby Dock Tower was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by William Armstrong. The docks expanded steadily over the course of the following century: No. 2 Fish Dock opened in 1877, the Union Dock and Alexandra Dock in 1879, and No. 3 Fish Dock was built in 1934. The port was served by a rail link to London's Billingsgate Fish Market, which created a truly national market for Grimsby's fish, allowing it to become renowned nationwide. The elegant Brixham trawler spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. Their distinctive sails inspired the song Red Sails in the Sunset, written aboard a Brixham sailing trawler called the Torbay Lass. By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from Holland and Scandinavia. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet. Although fishing vessel designed increasingly began to converge around the world, local conditions still often led the development of different types of fishing boats. The Lancashire nobby was used down the north west coast of England as a shrimp trawler from 1840 until World War II. The Manx nobby was used around the Isle of Man as a herring drifter. The fifie was also used as a herring drifter along the east coast of Scotland from the 1850s until well into the 20th century. The bawley and the smack were used in the Thames Estuary and off East Anglia, while trawlers and drifters were used on the east coast. Herring fishing started in the Moray Firth in 1819. The peak of the fishing at Aberdeen was in 1937 with 277 steam trawlers, though the first diesel drifter was introduced in 1926. In 1870 paddle tugs were being used to tow luggers and smacks to sea. Advent of steam power The earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . They weighed 40-50 tons and travelled at . The earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was Pioneer LH854. She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. Pioneer is mentioned in The Shetland Times of 4 May 1877. In 1878 he completed Forward and Onward, steam-powered trawlers for sale. Allan argued that his motivation for steam power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat. Allan built a total of ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being Degrave in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies. Seine net trawler, Hopeman 1958. The first steam boats were made of wood, but steel hulls were soon introduced and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. The boats had narrow, high funnels so that the steam and thick coal smoke was released high above the deck and away from the fishermen. These funnels were nicknamed woodbines because they looked like the popular brand of cigarette. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands. Steam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from weather, wind and tide. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch. The main disadvantage of the steam boats, though, was their high operating costs. Their engines were mechanically inefficient and took up much space, while fuel and fitting out costs were very high. Before the First World War, building costs were between £3,000 and £4,000, at least three times the cost of the sail boats. To cover these high costs, they needed to fish for longer seasons. The higher expenses meant that more steam drifters were company-owned or jointly owned. As the herring fishing industry declined, steam boats became too expensive. Steam trawlers were introduced at Grimsby and Hull in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby. Further development Armed trawler off Iceland. Trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by World War I to diesel and turbines by the end of World War II. During both World Wars, many fishing trawlers were commissioned as naval trawlers. Fishing trawlers were particularly suited for many naval requirements because they were robust boats designed to work heavy trawls in all types of weather and had large clear working decks. One could create a mine sweeper simply by replacing the trawl with a mine sweep. Adding depth charge racks on the deck, ASDIC below, and a or gun in the bows equipped the trawler for anti-submarine duties. The Royal Navy ordered many naval trawlers to Admiralty specifications. Shipyards such as Smiths Dock Company that were used to building fishing trawlers could easily switch to constructing naval versions. As a bonus, the Admiralty could sell these trawlers to commercial fishing interests when the wars ended. Still, many were sunk during the war, such as HMT Amethyst and HMT Force. Armed trawlers were also used to defend fishing groups from enemy aircraft or submarines. The smallest civilian trawlers were converted to danlayers. In 1931, the first powered drum was created by Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a circular device that was set to the side of the boat and would draw in the nets. The powered drum allowed the nets to be drawn in much faster, so fishermen were able to fish in areas they had previously been unable to go into, thereby revolutionizing the fishing industry. Commercial fishermen in Alaska, early 20th century. During World War II, navigation and communication devices, as well as many other forms of maritime equipment (depth-sounding and radar) were improved and made more compact. These devices became much more accessible to the average fisherman, thus making their range and mobility larger. It also served to make the industry much more competitive, as the fisherman were forced to invest more into their boats, equipped with electronic aids, such as radio navigation aids and fish finders. During the Cold War, some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as spy ships to monitor the activities of other countries. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. In 1947, the company Christian Salvesen, based in Leith, Scotland, refitted a surplus Algerine-class minesweeper (HMS Felicity) with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947. The first purpose built stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. Lord Nelson followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades. The introduction of fine synthetic fibres such as nylon in the construction of fishing gear during the 1960s marked an expansion in the commercial use of gillnets. The new materials were cheaper and easier to handle, lasted longer and required less maintenance than natural fibres. In addition, fibres such as nylon monofilaments become almost invisible in water, so nets made with synthetic twines generally caught greater numbers of fish than natural fibre nets used in comparable situations. Due to environmental concerns, gillnets were banned by the United Nations in 1993 in international waters, although their use is still permitted within of a coast. Recreational fishing The early evolution of fishing as recreation is not clear. For example, there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in Japan as early as the ninth century BC,Herd, Andrew (2003) The Fly. Medlar Press. and in Europe Claudius Aelianus (175–235 AD) describes fly fishing in his work On the Nature of Animals.\\"A Macedonian way of catching fish... They fasten red (crimson red) wool round a hook, and fix on to the wool two feathers which grow under a cock’s wattles, and which in colour are like wax. Their rod is six feet long, and their line is the same length. Then they throw their snare, and the fish, attracted and maddened by the colour, comes straight at it...\\" McCully, CB (2000) The Language of Fly-Fishing Taylor & Francis, pp. 76_78. . But for the early Japanese and Macedonians, fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. It is possible that antecedents of recreational fly fishing arrived in England with the Norman conquest of 1066. Although the point in history where fishing could first be said to be recreational is not clear,Schullery, Paul Fly fishing History: Beginnings: Aelian Lives it is clear that recreational fishing had fully arrived with the publication of The Compleat Angler. =Origins= Sketch of Juliana Berners, author of the earliest essay on recreational fishing. The earliest English essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, shortly after the invention of the printing press. The authorship of this was attributed to Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of the Benedictine Sopwell Nunnery. The essay was titled Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle,Berners, Dame Juliana (1496) A treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle (transcription by Risa S. Bear). and was published in the second Boke of Saint Albans, a treatise on hawking, hunting, and heraldry. These were major interests of the nobility, and the publisher, Wynkyn de Worde, was concerned that the book should be kept from those who were not gentlemen, since their immoderation in angling might \\"utterly destroy it\\".Cowx, I G (2002) Handbook of Fish Biology and Fisheries, Chapter 17: Recreational fishing. Blackwell Publishing. During the 16th century the work was much read, and was reprinted many times. Treatyse includes detailed information on fishing waters, the construction of rods and lines, and the use of natural baits and artificial flies. It also includes modern concerns about conservation and angler etiquette.Berners, Dame Juliana. (2008). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved June 20, 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online The earliest English poetical treatise on Angling by John Dennys, said to have been a fishing companion of Shakespeare, was published in 1613, The Secrets of Angling. Footnotes of the work, written by Dennys' editor, William Lawson, make the first mention of the phrase to 'cast a fly': \\"The trout gives the most gentlemanly and readiest sport of all, if you fish with an artificial fly, a line twice your rod's length of three hairs' thickness... and if you have learnt the cast of the fly.\\" Izaak Walton's Compleat Angler, published in 1653 helped popularize fly fishing as a sport. Woodcut by Louis Rhead The art of fly fishing took a great leap forward after the English Civil War, where a newly found interest in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on the subject at the time. The renowned officer in the Parliamentary army, Robert Venables, published in 1662 The Experienced Angler, or Angling improved, being a general discourse of angling, imparting many of the aptest ways and choicest experiments for the taking of most sorts of fish in pond or river. Another Civil War veteran to enthusiastically take up fishing, was Richard Franck. He was the first to describe salmon fishing in Scotland, and both in that and trout-fishing with artificial fly he was a practical angler. He was the first angler to name the burbot, and commended the salmon of the River Thames. Compleat Angler was written by Izaak Walton in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century) and described the fishing in the Derbyshire Wye. It was a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse; 6 verses were quoted from John Dennys's earlier work. A second part to the book was added by Walton's friend Charles Cotton. Walton did not profess to be an expert with a fishing fly; the fly fishing in his first edition was contributed by Thomas Barker, a retired cook and humorist, who produced a treatise of his own in 1659; but in the use of the live worm, the grasshopper and the frog \\"Piscator\\" himself could speak as a master. The famous passage about the frog, often misquoted as being about the worm—\\"use him as though you loved him, that is, harm him as little as you may possibly, that he may live the longer\\"—appears in the original edition. Cotton's additions completed the instruction in fly fishing and advised on the making of artificial flies where he listed sixty five varieties. Charles Kirby designed an improved fishing hook in 1655 that remains relatively unchanged to this day. He went on to invent the Kirby bend, a distinctive hook with an offset point, still commonly used today. =Development= Royal Warrant from the 1760s. The 18th century was mainly an era of consolidation of the techniques developed in the previous century. Running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialized for different roles. Jointed rods became common from the middle of the century and bamboo came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility. The industry also became commercialized - rods and tackle were sold at the haberdashers store. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, artisans moved to Redditch which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the 1730s. Onesimus Ustonson established his trading shop in 1761, and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century. He received a Royal Warrant from three successive monarchs starting with King George IV. Some have credited Onesimus with the invention of the multiplying winch, although he was certainly the first to advertise its sale. Early multiplying reels were wide and had a small diameter, and their gears, made of brass, often wore down after extensive use. His earliest advertisement in the form of a trading card date from 1768 and was entitled To all lovers of angling. A full list of the tackles he sold included artificial flies, and 'the best sort of multiplying brass winches both stop and plain'. The commercialization of the industry came at a time of expanded interest in fishing as a recreational hobby for members of the aristocracy. The impact of the Industrial Revolution was first felt in the manufacture of fly lines. Instead of anglers twisting their own lines - a laborious and time-consuming process - the new textile spinning machines allowed for a variety of tapered lines to be easily manufactured and marketed. British fly-fishing continued to develop in the 19th Century, with the emergence of fly fishing clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques. The Fly-fisher's Entomology by Alfred Ronalds had a great influence on the development of fly fishing when it was first published in 1836. Alfred Ronalds took up the sport of fly fishing, learning the craft on the rivers Trent, Blythe and Dove. On the River Blythe, near what is today Creswell Green, Ronalds constructed a bankside fishing hut designed primarily as an observatory of trout behaviour in the river. From this hut, and elsewhere on his home rivers, Ronalds conducted experiments and formulated the ideas that eventually were published in The Fly-fisher's Entomology in 1836. He combined his knowledge of fly fishing with his skill as an engraver and printer, to lavish his work with 20 colour plates. It was the first comprehensive work related to the entomology associated with fly fishing and most fly-fishing historians credit Ronalds with setting a literature standard in 1836 that is still followed today. Describing methods, techniques and, most importantly, artificial flies, in a meaningful way for the angler and illustrating them in colour is a method of presentation that can be seen in most fly-fishing literature today. The book was mostly about the aquatic insects—mayflies, caddisflies and stoneflies—that trout and grayling feed on and their counterpart artificial imitations. About half the book is devoted to observations of trout, their behaviour, and the methods and techniques used to catch them. Most of this information, although enhanced by Ronalds' experiences and observations, was merely an enhancement of Charles Bowlker's Art of Angling (first published in 1774 but still in print in 1836). In Chapter IV - Of a Selection of Insects, and Their Imitations, Used in Fly Fishing - for the first time is discussed specific artificial fly imitations by name, associated with the corresponding natural insect. Organized by their month of appearance, Ronalds was the first author to begin the standardization of angler names for artificial flies. Prior to The Fly-fisher's Entomology, anglers had been given suggestions for artificial flies to be used on a particular river or at a particular time of the year, but those suggestions were never matched to specific natural insects the angler might encounter on the water. According to Ernest Schwiebert: \\"Ronalds is one of the major milestones in the entire literature of fly-fishing, and with his Entomology the scientific method has reached angling in full flower. Ronalds was completely original in its content and research, setting the yardstick for all subsequent discussion and illustration of aquatic fly hatches. =Technological improvements= 'Nottingham' and 'Scarborough' reel designs. Modern reel design had begun in England during the later part of the 18th century, and the predominant model in use was known as the 'Nottingham reel'. The reel was a wide drum which spooled out freely, and was ideal for allowing the bait to drift along way out with the current. Geared multiplying reels never successfully caught on in Britain, but had more success in the United States, where similar models were modified by George Snyder of Kentucky into his bait-casting reel, the first American-made design in 1810. The material used for the rod itself changed from the heavy woods native to England, to lighter and more elastic varieties imported from abroad, especially from South America and the West Indies. Bamboo rods became the generally favoured option from the mid 19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them. George Cotton and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods, and light lines allowing the wind to do most of the work of getting the fly to the fish. Fishing became a popular recreational activity in the 19th century. Print from Currier and Ives. Tackle design began to improve from the 1880s. The introduction of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods made it possible to cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle - this was called a 'tangle' in Britain, and a 'backlash' in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling. The American, Charles F. Orvis, designed and distributed a novel reel and fly design in 1874, described by reel historian Jim Brown as the \\"benchmark of American reel design,\\" and the first fully modern fly reel.Brown, Jim. A Treasury of Reels: The Fishing Reel Collection of The American Museum of Fly Fishing. Manchester, Vermont: The American Museum of Fly Fishing, 1990.Schullery, Paul. The Orvis Story: 150 Years of an American Sporting Tradition. Manchester, Vermont, The Orvis Company, Inc., 2006 The founding of The Orvis Company helped institutionalize fly fishing by supplying angling equipment via the circulation of his tackle catalogs, distributed to a small but devoted customer list. Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a textiles magnate, patented the modern form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, the line was drawn off the leading edge of the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels. =Expansion= Frontispiece from The Art of Angling by Richard Brookes, 1790 By the mid to late 19th century, expanding leisure opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have its effect on fly fishing, which steadily grew in mass appeal. The expansion of the railway network in Britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or to rivers for fishing. Richer hobbyists ventured further abroad. The large rivers of Norway replete with large stocks of salmon began to attract fishers from England in large numbers in the middle of the century - Jones's guide to Norway, and salmon-fisher's pocket companion, published in 1848, was written by Frederic Tolfrey and was a popular guide to the country. In southern England, dry-fly fishing acquired an elitist reputation as the only acceptable method of fishing the slower, clearer rivers of the south such as the River Test and the other chalk streams concentrated in Hampshire, Surrey, Dorset and Berkshire (see Southern England Chalk Formation for the geological specifics). The weeds found in these rivers tend to grow very close to the surface, and it was felt necessary to develop new techniques that would keep the fly and the line on the surface of the stream. These became the foundation of all later dry-fly developments. However, there was nothing to prevent the successful employment of wet flies on these chalk streams, as G. E. M. Skues proved with his nymph and wet fly techniques. To the horror of dry-fly purists, Skues later wrote two books, Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream, and The Way of a Trout with a Fly, which greatly influenced the development of wet fly fishing. In northern England and Scotland, many anglers also favored wet-fly fishing, where the technique was more popular and widely practiced than in southern England. One of Scotland's leading proponents of the wet fly in the early-to-mid 19th century was W. C. Stewart, who published \\"The Practical Angler\\" in 1857. From The Speckled Brook Trout by Louis Rhead (1902) In the United States, attitudes toward methods of fly fishing were not nearly as rigidly defined, and both dry- and wet-fly fishing were soon adapted to the conditions of the country. Fly anglers there, are thought to be the first anglers to have used artificial lures for bass fishing. After pressing into service the fly patterns and tackle designed for trout and salmon to catch largemouth and smallmouth bass, they began to adapt these patterns into specific bass flies. Fly anglers seeking bass developed the spinner/fly lure and bass popper fly, which are still used today.Waterman, Charles F., Black Bass and the Fly Rod, Stackpole Books (1993) In the late 19th century, American anglers, such as Theodore Gordon, in the Catskill Mountains of New York began using fly tackle to fish the region's brook trout-rich streams such as the Beaverkill and Willowemoc Creek. Many of these early American fly anglers also developed new fly patterns and wrote extensively about their sport, increasing the popularity of fly fishing in the region and in the United States as a whole. Albert Bigelow Paine, a New England author, wrote about fly fishing in The Tent Dwellers, a book about a three-week trip he and a friend took to central Nova Scotia in 1908. Participation in fly fishing peaked in the early 1920s in the eastern states of Maine and Vermont and in the Midwest in the spring creeks of Wisconsin. Along with deep sea fishing, Ernest Hemingway did much to popularize fly fishing through his works of fiction, including The Sun Also Rises. Fly fishing in Australia took off when brown trout were first introduced by the efforts of Edward Wilson's Acclimatisation Society of Victoria with the aim to \\"provide for manly sport which will lead Australian youth to seek recreation on the river's bank and mountainside rather than in the Cafe and Casino.The Argus newspaper 14 April 1864\\" The first successful transfer of Brown Trout ova (from the Itchen and Wye) was accomplished by James Arndell Youl, with a consignment aboard The Norfolk in 1864. Rainbow Trout were not introduced until 1894. It was the development of inexpensive fiberglass rods, synthetic fly lines, and monofilament leaders, however, in the early 1950s, that revived the popularity of fly fishing. In recent years, interest in fly fishing has surged as baby boomers have discovered the sport. Movies such as Robert Redford's film A River Runs Through It, starring Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt, cable fishing shows, and the emergence of a competitive fly casting circuit have added to the sport's visibility.

At the time the hotel opened in January 1921, the chain consisted of the Ambassador Los Angeles, the Hotel Alexandria in Los Angeles, the Ambassador Santa Barbara, the Ambassador Atlantic City and the Ambassador New York. The Santa Barbara property burned down soon after on April 13, 1921, and the Alexandria left the chain in 1925, while the Ambassador Palm Beach joined in 1929. The Schine Family owned the Ambassador from its opening in 1921 until 1971; it was set back from Wilshire Boulevard on 24 acres, which included the main hotel, a garage and several detached bungalows. The Ambassador Hotel was frequented by celebrities, some of whom, such as Pola Negri, resided there. From 1930 to 1943, six Academy Awards ceremonies were hosted at the hotel. Perhaps as many as seven U.S. presidents stayed at the Ambassador, from Hoover to Nixon, along with chiefs of state from around the world. For decades, the hotel's famed Cocoanut Grove nightclub hosted well-known entertainers, such as Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Nancy Wilson, Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Liza Minnelli, Martin and Lewis, The Supremes, Merv Griffin, Dorothy Dandridge, Vikki Carr, Evelyn Knight, Vivian Vance, Dick Haymes, Sergio Franchi, Perry Como, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, Sammy Davis Jr., Little Richard, Liberace, Natalie Cole, Richard Pryor and Shirley Bassey. On June 5, 1968, the winner of the California Democratic presidential primary election, United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy, was addressing a speech at the Ambassador Hotel to an excited crowd of hopeful supporters. After the brief victory speech in the Embassy Room, Kennedy was shot three times along with five other people in the pantry area of the hotel’s main kitchen soon after midnight. Palestinian immigrant Sirhan Sirhan was arrested at the scene and later convicted of the murder. Kennedy died the following day due to his injuries, while the other victims survived from their wounds. During the demolition of the Ambassador Hotel in late 2005 and early 2006, portions of the area where the 1968 shooting occurred were eliminated from the site. The section of Wilshire Boulevard in front of the hotel has been signed the \\"Robert F. Kennedy Parkway\\".

All of these techniques are still used today but the more modern techniques of freezing and canning have taken on a large importance. Fish curing includes and of curing fish by drying, salting, smoking, and pickling, or by combinations of these processes have been employed since ancient times. On sailing vessels fish were usually salted down immediately to prevent spoilage; the swifter boats of today commonly bring in unsalted fish. Modern freezing and canning methods have largely supplanted older methods of preservation. Fish to be cured are usually first cleaned, scaled, and eviscerated. Fish are salted by packing them between layers of salt or by immersion in brine. The fish most extensively salted are cod, herring, mackerel, and haddock. Smoking preserves fish by drying, by deposition of creosote ingredients, and, when the fish are near the source of heat, by heat penetration. Herring and haddock (finnan haddie) are commonly smoked. Kippers are split herring, and bloaters are whole herring, salted and smoked. Sardines, pilchards, and anchovies are small fish of the herring family, often salted and smoked and then preserved in oil. Fish are dried under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, and air velocity. Since the dried product is relatively unappetizing and rehydrating slow, other preservation methods are common. History In the past, fishing vessels were restricted in range by the simple consideration that the catch must be returned to port before it spoils and becomes worthless. The development of refrigeration and freezing technologies transformed the commercial fishing industry: fishing vessels could be larger, spending more time away from port and therefore accessing fish stocks at a much greater distance. Refrigeration and freezing also allow the catch to be distributed to markets further inland, reaching customers who previously would have had access only to dried or salted sea fish. Canning, developed during the 19th century, has also had a significant impact on fishing by allowing seasonal catches of fish that are possibly far from large centres of population to be exploited. For example: canned sardines. Preservation techniques are needed to prevent fish spoilage and lengthen shelf life. They are designed to inhibit the activity of spoilage bacteria and the metabolic changes that result in the loss of fish quality. Spoilage bacteria are the specific bacteria that produce the unpleasant odours and flavours associated with spoiled fish. Fish normally host many bacteria that are not spoilage bacteria, and most of the bacteria present on spoiled fish played no role in the spoilage.Huss HH (1988) Quality and quality changes in fresh fish FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 348, Rome. . To flourish, bacteria need the right temperature, sufficient water and oxygen, and surroundings that are not too acidic. Preservation techniques work by interrupting one or more of these needs. Preservation techniques can be classified as follows.FAO: Preservation techniques Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome. Updated 27 May 2005. Retrieved 14 March 2011. Control of temperature Ice preserves fish and extends shelf life by lowering the temperature If the temperature is decreased, the metabolic activity in the fish from microbial or autolytic processes can be reduced or stopped. This is achieved by refrigeration where the temperature is dropped to about 0 °C, or freezing where the temperature is dropped below -18 °C. On fishing vessels, the fish are refrigerated mechanically by circulating cold air or by packing the fish in boxes with ice. Forage fish, which are often caught in large numbers, are usually chilled with refrigerated or chilled seawater. Once chilled or frozen, the fish need further cooling to maintain the low temperature. There are key issues with fish cold store design and management, such as how large and energy efficient they are, and the way they are insulated and palletized. An effective method of preserving the freshness of fish is to chill with ice by distributing ice uniformly around the fish. It is a safe cooling method that keeps the fish moist and in an easily stored form suitable for transport. It has become widely used since the development of mechanical refrigeration, which makes ice easy and cheap to produce. Ice is produced in various shapes; crushed ice and ice flakes, plates, tubes and blocks are commonly used to cool fish.FAO: Handling of fish and fish products Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome. Updated 27 May 2005. Retrieved 22 July 2012. Particularly effective is slurry ice, made from microcrystals of ice formed and suspended within a solution of water and a freezing point depressant, such as common salt.Kauffeld M, Kawaji M and Egol PW (Eds.) (2005)Handbook on ice slurries: fundamentals and engineering, International Institute of Refrigeration. . A more recent development is pumpable ice technology. Pumpable ice flows like water, and because it is homogeneous, it cools fish faster than freshwater solid ice methods and eliminates freeze burns. It complies with HACCP and ISO food safety and public health standards, and uses less energy than conventional freshwater solid ice technologies.

It ranges between 0 and 1, and is a parameter that measures how available the water is in the flesh of the fish. Available water is necessary for the microbial and enzymatic reactions involved in spoilage. There are a number of techniques that have been or are used to tie up the available water or remove it by reducing the aw. Traditionally, techniques such as drying, salting and smoking have been used, and have been used for thousands of years. These techniques can be very simple, for example, by using solar drying. In more recent times, freeze- drying, water-binding humectants, and fully automated equipment with temperature and humidity control have been added. Often a combination of these techniques is used.

Heat is applied by cooking, blanching or microwave heating in a manner that pasteurizes or sterilizes fish products. Cooking or pasteurizing does not completely inactivate microorganisms and may need to be followed with refrigeration to preserve fish products and increase their shelf life. Sterilised products are stable at ambient temperatures up to 40 °C, but to ensure they remain sterilized they need packaging in metal cans or retortable pouches before the heat treatment. Chemical control of microbial loads Microbial growth and proliferation can be inhibited by a technique called biopreservation.Ananou1 S, Maqueda1 M, Martínez-Bueno1 M and Valdivia1 E (2007) \\"Biopreservation, an ecological approach to improve the safety and shelf-life of foods\\" In: A. Méndez-Vilas (Ed.) Communicating Current Research and Educational Topics and Trends in Applied Microbiology, Formatex. . Biopreservation is achieved by adding antimicrobials or by increasing the acidity of the fish muscle. Most bacteria stop multiplying when the pH is less than 4.5. Acidity is increased by fermentation, marination or by directly adding acids (acetic, citric, lactic) to fish products. Lactic acid bacteria produce the antimicrobial nisin which further enhances preservation. Other preservatives include nitrites, sulphites, sorbates, benzoates and essential oils. Control of the oxygen reduction potential Spoilage bacteria and lipid oxidation usually need oxygen, so reducing the oxygen around fish can increase shelf life. This is done by controlling or modifying the atmosphere around the fish, or by vacuum packaging. Controlled or modified atmospheres have specific combinations of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and the method is often combined with refrigeration for more effective fish preservation. Combined techniques Two or more of these techniques are often combined. This can improve preservation and reduce unwanted side effects such as the denaturation of nutrients by severe heat treatments. Common combinations are salting/drying, salting/marinating, salting/smoking, drying/smoking, pasteurization/refrigeration and controlled atmosphere/refrigeration. Other process combinations are currently being developed along the multiple hurdle theory.Leistner L and Gould GW (2002) Hurdle technologies: combination treatments for food stability, safety, and quality Springer. .

Molecular conductance is dependent on the surrounding conditions (e.g. pH, temperature, pressure), as well as the properties of measuring device. Many experimental techniques have been developed in an attempt to measure this quantity directly, but theorists and experimentalists still face many challenges.Chen F, Hihath J, Huang Z, Li X, Tao NJ. 2007. Measurement of single-molecule conductance. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 58:535-64 Recently, a great deal of progress has been made in the development of reliable conductance-measuring techniques. These techniques can be divided into two categories: molecular film experiments, which measure groups of tens of molecules, and single-molecule-measuring experiments. Molecular film experiments Molecular film experiments generally consist of the sandwiching of a thin layer of molecules between two electrodes which are used to measure the conductance through the layer. Two of the most successful implementations of this concept have been the bulk electrode approach and in the use of nanoelectrodes. In the bulk electrode approach, a molecular film is typically immobilized onto one electrode and an upper electrode is brought into contact with it allowing for a measure of current flow as a function of applied bias voltage. The nanoelectrode class of experiments, in creatively utilizing equipment such as atomic force microscope tips and small-radius wires, are able to perform the same sorts of current versus applied bias measurements but on a much smaller number of molecules as compared to bulk electrode. For instance, the tip of an atomic force microscope can be used as a top electrode and, given the nano-scale radius of curvature of the tip, the number of molecules measured is drastically cut. The difficulties encountered in these experiments have come mainly in dealing with such thin layers of molecules which often results in problems with short-circuiting the electrodes. Single-molecule-measurement  A molecule covalently connected to two electrodes. More recently, single-molecule-measurement experiments have been developed that are bringing experimenters a better look at molecular conductance. These fall under the categories of scanning probe, which involves fixed electrode, and mechanically formed junction techniques. One example of a mechanically formed junction experiment involves using a movable electrode to make contact with and then pull away from an electrode surface coated with a single layer of molecules. As the electrode is removed from the surface the molecules that had bonded between the two electrodes begin to detach until eventually one molecule is connected. The atomic-level geometry of the tip- electrode contact has an effect on the conductance and can change from one run of the experiment to the next so a histogram approach is required. Forming a junction in which the precise contact geometry is known has been one of the main difficulties with this approach.  Applications  An important first step toward the goal of building electronic devices on the molecular level is the ability to measure and control the electric current through an individual molecule. Based on the anticipated continuation of Moore's Law, which is expected to carry the miniaturization of transistors on integrated circuits into the atomic scale within the next 10 to 20 years, this goal of single- molecule-level circuit design is likely to become widespread throughout the semiconductor industry. Other applications focus on the insight provided by these experiments in the area of charge transport, which is a recurrent phenomenon in many chemical and biological processes. This sort of insight gives researchers the ability to read the chemical information stored in a single molecule electronically, which can then be used in a wide variety of chemical and biosensor applications.

Jìngxiāng (敬香 \\"offering incense with respect\\"), shàngxiāng (上香 \\"offering incense\\"), bàishén (拜神 \\"worshipping gods\\"), is a ritual of offering incense accompanied by tea and or fruits in Chinese traditional religion. In ancestral religious worship it's jìngzǔ (敬祖 \\"veneration of the ancestor\\") or bàizǔ 拜祖 (\\"worship of the ancestor\\"). It is observed by a devotee holding joss incense with both hands in front of an altar while praying or meditating. For added respect the devotee or descendant is expected to kneel during and after placing the incense in the urn or at the altar. Jiangxiang is practiced in diffused Chinese folk religion and also by adherents belonging to the schools of Taoism, Chinese Buddhism and Confucianism. It's used for making a general prayer to one of the Chinese deities, sending well wishes to a deceased ancestor as part of daily prayers in Chinese ancestor veneration, or celebrating the Qingming Festival, Ghost festival and Chongyang Festival . Number and meanings of incense The number of joss stick varies, usually three or five, or less commonly, nine. The ancient Chinese consider that even numbers are associated with yin, and odd numbers are associated with yang. Because yang represents positive and auspicious things, odd numbers like three, five and nine are preferred in many rituals. Sandalwood joss The scent of the joss sticks is believed to calm the human spirit. The same effect is believed to affect the spirit of a deceased ancestor. In this connection it also serves as a notice to the deity an adherent is respecting. It is also considered a form of food to the spirits and gods in Daoism and Chinese Buddhism. Other offerings Usually jingxiang is done with an offering of tea, in a number corresponding to the gods, typically three cups. Fruit is generally offered to accompany Jingxiang, again the specification differs for temples or deities.

He was himself lord of Châteauneuf-de-Randon in the Gévaudan and a vassal of Ermengarde of Narbonne and of Eleanor of Aquitaine.Ippolito, Marguerite-Marie. (2001).

Églises romanes de Haute-Auvergne (Editions Creer, ), p. 21 If he was of Randon, then his father was Garin (Guérin) de Randon, a vassal of Raymond Berengar III, Count of Barcelona, of whom Guérin and his brother Odilon held the castle of Randon.Garin Le Brun (milieu XIIe siècle) online at histoire-ma.chez-alice.fr (accessed 5 March 2008) This is likely, as a Garin paid homage to the count of Barcelona for this castle in 1150. In 1162, Garin lo Brun appears to have died, as in that year his brother William (Guillaume), called Randon protecteur des troubadours (\\"Randon, Protector of Troubadours\\"), arranged a requiem mass for him and granted Grosvialla (Groviala) to the Knights Templar for the rest of his soul. Tenso Garin composed mostly tensos, but only one of these has survived and is an imaginary dialogue between Mezura (moderation) and Leujaria (lightness), that is, both sides of the debate are written by Garin. For Lightness, the true wisdom in love is folly: a man must get on, lose no chances, and show boldness to obtain the favour of ladies of the highest possible rank. Moderation, on the other hand, advises self-restraint in love, treading softly without showing impatience. Moderation's advice to women is not to give all they have suddenly, leaving nothing to offer.This advice to women has resonances with Garin's advice to a great lady in his \\"Ensenhamen\\" This tenso was dedicated to one Eblon de Saignes. The medievalist Mark Johnston notes that Garin's work is similar to that of another 12th-century troubadour poet, Arnaut Guilhem de Marsan.Johnston, Mark. \\"Gender as Conduct in the Courtesy Guides for Aristocratic Boys and Girls of Amanieu de Sescas.\\" Essays in Medieval Studies, 20 (2003), pp. 75-84 Ensenhamen The author of Garin's vida (biography) comments that \\"he went to the trouble of telling the ladies how they should behave themselves.\\"Egan, Margarita, ed.

(1985). An Introduction to Old Provençal Versification (Diane Publishing, ), p. 253 This is written in isometric rhymed hexameter and has been dated to 1155. Perhaps the earliest known text is contained in the Pierpont Morgan Library's MS 819, an illuminated manuscript of the 13th century, in which Garin's poem is contained together with another similar didactic work by Arnaut de Mareuil, in the first fifty-two folios.Nichols, Stephen G. and Wenzel, Siegfried. (1996). The Whole Book: Cultural Perspectives on the Medieval Miscellany (University of Michigan Press), p. 99 Garin's work has over a hundred verses on the beauty of nature and the sorry state of contemporary mores, but its main theme is the courtly behaviour of women. It is therefore sometimes called Ensenhamen de la donzela (\\"Ensenhamen of the girl\\") or L'ensegnamen alla dama (\\"The ensenhamen to woman\\"). It is part of the medieval \\"conduct literature\\" which urges women to adapt themselves to their husbands, to be merry or sad as their men are merry or sad.Perfetti, Lisa. (2003) Women and Laughter in Medieval Comic Literature (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press), Introduction online at press.umich.edu (accessed 5 March 2008) Garin counsels also that women should sing and recite poetry for their guests.Bowers, Jane M. and Tick, Judith.

The hospital campus is located in Passaic, New Jersey on a plot of land bordered on the south by Oak Street, the north by Crescent Place, the west by Lafayette Avenue, and the east by Boulevard. St. Mary's address, officially, is 350 Boulevard. For most of its existence, however, the hospital operated at a facility located at 211 Pennington Avenue in the Passaic Park section of the city. It is affiliated with the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth, a Roman Catholic convent in Morris Township, New Jersey. As of 2014, St. Mary's is owned by Prime Healthcare Services. It added the \\"General\\" to its name following the acquisition. Description St. Mary’s Hospital currently serves approximately 13,000 inpatients annually, in addition to caring for 10,500 patients requiring same-day procedures. A new ER Fast Track Center was added in 2009 to better accommodate the nearly 35,000 visits to St. Mary’s busy ER each year. St. Mary's Hospital main facility located at 350 Boulevard History of hospitals in Passaic Construction of St. Mary's original location began on May 23, 1897. (Other accounts, likely mistaken, indicate that it was almost completed in March of that year.) Until then, the city had only a medical dispensary, but not a full service hospital facility. There was some controversy between competing groups over the building of a new hospital, but both groups appear to have succeeded in opening separate institutions at about the same time. Two other hospitals opened later, giving the city three hospitals for many years. They all eventually merged into a single remaining entity, today's St. Mary's. Though each provided full-service hospital facilities, each predecessor Passaic hospital had its own specialty. *Original General Hospital complex. on the site of the current St. Mary's campus.Passaic General Hospital, later known as The General Hospital Center at Passaic, was located at 350 Boulevard (St. Mary's present location). Passaic General's specialty was cardiology, renowned for its Eastern Heart Institute and for pioneering the first open heart surgery in the state. It opened on November 1, 1897, despite thin financing. The hospital grounds were donated for the purpose by descendants of the Aycrigg family. * Passaic Beth Israel Hospital, often known as PBI, was the city's other sectarian hospital. It was funded by the local Jewish community, and located on Parker Avenue near Passaic's northern border with neighboring Clifton. It was a leader in treating cancer, having respected center of excellence in the field on oncology. PBI later merged with Passaic General. HOLY NAME CLUB HOUSE Temporary first home of St Mary's Hospital First Purpose-built St. Mary's building * St. Mary's Hospital was lauded for its maternal-child and behavioral health programs. The original hospital complex was at 211 Pennington Avenue in Passaic Park. St. Mary's later bought the assets of the other two hospitals and moved to the 350 Boulevard location, where it continues to operate. St. Mary's first hospital opened on August 15, 1895, in a club house near St. Nicholas Catholic Church on Washington Street. The church's rector purchased the Pennington Avenue site at about the same time, and the building opened November 8, 1898. =2000-2004: merging of General and Beth Israel, eventual bankruptcy= In 2000, Atlantic Health Systems acquired the General Hospital Center at Passaic. Four years later, the owners of Beth Israel Hospital bought General from Atlantic and closed the Parker Avenue facility, merging the operations of both hospitals into the Boulevard facility. The merged hospital took on the name PBI Regional Medical Center. Within two years, PBI Regional filed for bankruptcy due to mismanagement from administration and staff. =2006: St. Mary's steps in= St. Mary's, which was having problems maintaining its 112-year-old facility, was called on to save the failing hospital and received a grant from the state to purchase the hospital and move their operations to the Boulevard site, thus leaving Passaic with one surviving hospital. Although on March 9, 2009, St. Mary's Hospital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a federal bankruptcy judge approved of its reorganization plan less than a year from filing, as reported in the week of March 2, 2010. \\"St. Mary's emerges from Chapter 11 stronger and better than before,\\" said Michael J. Sniffen, St. Mary's president/CEO, in a media release. \\"After less than one year, we emerge revitalized, improved, and re-committed to serving the community and the physicians that have so loyally supported us through this difficult process.\\" The facility on Pennington Avenue was maintained for psychiatric admissions and care for some time after the rest of the hospital moved. However, St. Mary's closed its psychiatric unit on May 12, 2009, transferring admissions to Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville, New Jersey. The Psychiatric Emergency Screening Unit moved to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson; this unit is the primary facility used for psychiatric emergency care in Passaic County.[2] This now leaves the original facility empty. From 2009 to 2010 the building was used by NBC to film episodes of the first season of the medical drama Mercy (TV series). -St Mary's Hospital, 211 Pennington Avenue, Passaic, New Jersey: Cleaver Brooks boiler Explosion 7/15/06.

Harry Gilmor, 2nd Maryland Cavalry The 2nd Maryland Cavalry,2nd Maryland Cavalry, CSA a.k.a. Gilmor's Partisan Rangers, was a Confederate unit in the American Civil War. History The unit was founded and commanded by Colonel Harry Gilmor. Gilmor was a member of the Towson Guards (a.k.a. Baltimore Horse Guards), when the Civil War started. Due to his political views, he was taken prisoner by the U.S. Federal government and imprisoned at Fort McHenry. After he was released, he went to the Shenandoah Valley to join the Confederate Army. He served as a scout for Colonel Turner Ashby, General J. E. B. Stuart's predecessor. Gilmor joined as a Private, but was quickly promoted to Sergeant Major. In March, 1862, he had raised his own company, which was attached to the 12th Virginia Cavalry. Gilmor served with General Stonewall Jackson at McDowell County, West Virginia in May 1862. Gilmor's Cavalry Company spent the next three months scouting, serving as couriers and harassing enemy camps and trains. In September 1862, Harry Gilmor was with General Jackson when he crossed the Potomac River into Maryland. While in Maryland, Gilmor went on \\"French leave\\", to see his family in Towson, Maryland, just north of Baltimore. While en route to his family home, Glen Ellen Plantation, Gilmor was taken prisoner by Union Forces. Sometime later, Harry Gilmor was back with Confederate Forces as part of a prisoner exchange. He was serving under General JEB Stuart at the Battle of Kelly's Ford in March 1863. Shortly after the battle, Harry Gilmor petitioned to raise his own cavalry regiment. He organized several companies of mostly Marylanders into a unit that called themselves \\"The Band\\". Occasionally, Gilmor's Battalion fought alongside other units such as McNeill's Rangers, and the 1st Maryland Cavalry, CSA. During the Confederate campaign into Maryland in June 1863, Harry Gilmor was temporarily placed in command of the 1st Maryland Cavalry, after its commander was wounded in combat. After the Maryland Campaign, the Confederate Army returned to Virginia. During this time, Gilmor had 6 full companies of rangers operating in the Shenandoah Valley. They conducted mainly guerrilla-type operations against Union wagon trains, railroads, telegraph lines, depots, bridges and encampments. In June 1864, Gilmor's Battalion was designated as the 2nd Maryland Cavalry. The 1st & 2nd Maryland Cavalry units became involved in almost daily skirmishes with Union General Sheridan's cavalry. In one of these battles, Colonel Gilmor was seriously wounded, and did not return to action until October. In February 1865, the 2nd Maryland went into West Virginia to forage for supplies, and to meet up with McNeill's Rangers. In the process, Colonel Harry Gilmor was captured on February 4, 1865, and taken to Fort Warren, Massachusetts.

History The building was the original home of the General Hospital Center at Passaic, or Passaic General for short. The PBI in the name came from the former Passaic Beth Israel Hospital, which was located on Parker Avenue. Shortly after Atlantic Healthcare Systems, which owned Passaic General, sold the hospital, Passaic General began to have financial trouble. To consolidate, both Passaic General and Beth Israel were merged into one hospital system, which became known as PBI Regional, and consolidated their operations to the Boulevard building (Beth Israel Hospital was subsequently demolished, 2005). The financial struggles continued for PBI after the merger, and eventually the hospital was taken over by the St. Mary's system, which moved their operations to the site and reduced Passaic to one hospital where three had existed prior to the merger.

Meteorological background Persistent above-average rainfall began to affect most of Victoria apart from eastern Gippsland in April 1909 as a result of strong southern low-pressure systems interacting with moisture in the Indian Ocean.Watt, W.S.; Results of Rainfall Observations Made in Victoria; published 1937 with the authority of the Minister of State for the Interior; p. 19 Although April and May were moist, June was exceptionally wet, seeing in many places (e.g. Melbourne) a record number of rainy days for any month. The heavy June falls had already made the ground throughout Victoria very moist, and despite the fact that July rainfall was only above normal in the north of the State was of relatively little significance as evaporation was too low to dry the ground. The floods The breach in the Laanecoorie Weir following the 1909 flood. With these moist conditions, it was natural that heavy rain in August would cause major flooding on the State's rivers, and a series of very slow-movingThe Age, 1 September 1909 depressions naturally caused August to be very wet. As early as 11 August major flooding on the Richardson River at Donald was anticipated.Warrnambool Standard, 12 August 1909 The third of four major depressions for the month arrived in western Victoria on the 17th and produced very heavy falls upon already-saturated catchments on flat land where water was not draining away quickly. As the slow-moving depression linked with warm air from the Tasman Sea, thunderstorms began to develop over the Wimmera region on the 18th.Donald Times, 18 August 1909 Rich Avon recorded 50mm (2 inches) from one of these whilst in the Great Divide there were reports that some areas had received as much as 100mm (4 inches) in as little as six hours. As a result of this heavy rain, many rivers rose to record or near-record levels. The Avoca River rose above the top of sheds of farmhouses near its banks, as the Hopkins and the Merri River near the coast.Warrnambool Standard, 21 August 1909 Further east, houses at Inglewood were swamped and many buildings were wrecked by the swollen Loddon River.Donald Times, 21 August 1909 In Donald itself, not only roads, but even footpaths were devastated as the Richardson River flooded the town to a level never seen before or since, eventually reaching normally-dry Lake Buloke. Near Geelong, four people were drowned trying to cross the flooded Barwon River at Winchelsea. The floods had a major impact upon agriculture in the region, with many crops in the Western District completely destroyed through being soaked - not only during the floods, but also before they reached their peak.Terang Express, 24 August 1909 Large numbers of sheep in the Western District were killed because of foot-rot due to the wet ground. Unusually for floods in Australia, not only did the rivers recede rapidly but the excessively wet conditions of the autumn and winter that produced them gave way to much drier weather from September onwards so that a repeat was never remotely possible. Flooding during August 1909 also happened in South Australia, the northeast of Victoria and more northerly parts of the Murray-Darling Basin; however, these were not as unusual as those in the Wimmera and Western District.

After the site's successful testing phase in late 2007, ZADZADZ officially launched on January 17, 2008.  Overview  The ZADZADZ website comprises the largest collection of active television commercials online. The ads are grouped into various categories and are automatically streamed through the site's central player, depending on what playlist is selected by the user. Additional functionality also exists, including the ability to sort the ads, e-mail or embed ads, and search for ads. ZADZADZ is a \\"Window Shopping 2.0\\" experience for the user because of its grouping of television commercials into relevant product and psychographic \\"channels\\". Browsing between individual channels allows the user to quickly shop and compare products and services via the ads themselves. Essentially a free site, all of the basic video database content is available without registration and without providing any personal information. Any person with an e-mail address and a web browser that accepts cookies can set up an account with ZADZADZ that allows them to vote on various channels' ads and engage in many other site activities. In addition to a consumer shopping tool, ZADZADZ is an advertising and entertainment industry resource, tracking and showcasing current brand/market trends, including celebrity endorsements, high-profile product introductions, and creative execution feedback and refinement.  History  = Reason for Being = Founded by advertising executives Russell Griffin and Chandos Erwin, ZADZADZ was created, in many ways, as a response to the DVRs and TiVos of the world. As people began to skip ads while watching their favorite TV shows, technology was empowering the consumer to watch their content without interruption. But, (perhaps unbeknownst to viewer) at the same time, technology was depriving consumers of a vital source of product information and cultural relevance. With the introduction of ZADZADZ the equation was once again balanced: With DVRs consumers could skip ads in order to get to their desired content (their TV shows), and with ZADZADZ consumers could choose which ads to watch when the ads themselves are the desired content (when preparing to make a purchase or when simply staying up with cultural trends). = Super Bowl = On February 3, 2008 ZADZADZ launched a feature that enabled users to watch and rate the Super Bowl XLII ads as well as a media tool for outlets to report the ongoing results at any moment in time. ZADZADZ was quickly utilized as a resource by other web sites and users rated the ads in varying categories.

Chron., ser. 3,. 2: 155. 1887. It is found in humid, mossy, mixed and coniferous forests at elevations of 1000 to 1500 meters, in areas with dry winter and a wet spring and summer. The plant has tufted, pendant, subterete, striated, several-noded, white-sheathed stems carrying alternate, fleshy, oblong, acute leaves. Plicatol B is a phenanthrene that can be isolated from the orchid.Plicatol B at kanaya.naist.jp/knapsack_jsp  Flowering  The long-lasting, fragrant flowers are found from winter to spring on short to 3\\" [7.5 cm], single flowered inflorescence that arise from the nodes of leafless canes. The flower size is usually about 2\\" [about 5 cm]. The petals are lilac in colour, the sepals are purple, and the lips are reddish orange.  Care  Fertilizing: Plants may be fertilized with: 1. water-soluble, quick release fertilizers; 2. temperature controlled slow- release fertilizers; 3. or organic fertilizers such as fish emulsion. Water- soluble fertilizers are used every two weeks or per label instructions. Controlled, slow-release fertilizers are carefully worked into the soil usually only once during the growing season or per label directions. For organic fertilizers, such as fish emulsion, follow label directions. Allow houseplants to 'rest' during the winter months; stop fertilizing in late October and resume feeding in late February. Lighting: Preference low to moderate lighting, as full sun may burn leaves. Watering: Preference mist every 1–2 days on warmer weather, while mist 1-2 times a week on cooler evenings. Re-potting: Potting Terrestrial Orchids Good drainage is important. Mix 3 parts fibrous peat, 3 parts coarse grit, 1 part perlite, and 1 part charcoal. Select a pot that will accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make sure that it has a drainage hole. Hold the orchid over the pot so that the crown is just below the rim of the pot. With your other hand, fill pot with moistened soil mix, tamping to firm. There really is no need to add crockery to the bottom of the pot, but you may want to add a small square of wire mesh or other permiable fabric over hole in bottom of pot. Potting Epiphytic Orchids Epiphytes prefer conditions where roots can be exposed, therefore, tight pots and close-contact soil mixes do not work well and will induce rot. Mix 3 parts dust-free, medium-grade bark, 1 part coarse grit or perlite, 1 part charcoal, and 1 part peat moss together, OR use a commercial orchid mix. As with the terrestrial orchid, select a pot that will accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make sure that it has a drainage hole. Even better, select an orchid pot, which has vertical slits down sides. Hold orchid over pot so that crown is just below the rim of the pot. With other hand, fill pot with moistened bark mix, tamping to firm. Some epiphytes do not need to be potted and prefer to grow on a mound or slab of bark. Until roots attach, tie orchid in place with fishing line. Constant humidity is a must. Support Orchids that have long flower stalks will need staking. Staking is best done as stem grows and before buds open. Many growers prefer to insert stake when potting orchid, but it is up to you.

In 2008, director Ava DuVernay, who had performed at the cafe with the Figures of Speech hip hop group, released a documentary about the cafe, This Is The Life. The film featured a number of hip hop artists discussing the importance of the Good Life Cafe to themselves and the hip hop scene. The Cafe was open from 1989 to 1999. It was described as \\"a platform for rappers to perform their material\\" and \\"a testing ground for Los Angeles' independent rap scene\\". Artists like Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, and Lenny Kravitz and others reportedly attended the open-mic, while many other musicians learned their skills at the events. History The Good Life Health Food Centre's weekly open-mic night began December 1989 on the intersection of Crenshaw Blvd & Exposition Blvd. Started by B. Hall and her son R/KainBlaze with his friends The Mighty O-Roc and The Dynamic Flow, KNGR: The Underground Radio at the Good Life offered a workshop-like atmosphere for aspiring MCs, poets and musicians to hone their craft. On Thursday nights from 8-10pm, artists were allowed to perform one song. Some would perform written songs, and some would freestyle. When a performance was not up to par, the audience would call out \\"Please pass the mic!\\" and the emcee would end the performance promptly. In addition, there was a strict policy that no cursing was allowed. B. Hall once explained, \\"Young people needed a place to go to develop their own art. The no-cussing policy wasn’t about us being uptight church people, it was about wanting the atmosphere of a serious arts workshop. Most of the crowd respected the rule, some said it made rapping more challenging, that it created more respect and brotherhood.\\"Morgan, Marcyliena. Real Hiphop: Battling for Knowledge Google Books After the venue closed at night, people would take their rhymes into the parking lot and battle after closing. In December 1995, several notable performers established Project Blowed which became its own successful venue. Lenny Kravitz, Common, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, will.i.am and Macy Gray reportedly attended the open-mic, while artists such as The Pharcyde, Biz Markie, Fat Joe, Skee-Lo, and Kurupt occasionally performed there. Good Life regulars Rebels of Rhythm and Unity Committee came together to form Jurassic 5. Other Good Life regulars included Freestyle Fellowship, The Righteous Family, Pigeon John, Abstract Rude, Chillin Villain Empire, Rifleman Ellay Khule, Volume 10, Medusa, OMD, Spoon Iodine, Ganjah K, Fat Jack, The Nonce and many others. Core years that one would consider the GoodLife Open Mics apex were hosted by a cast of highly influential lyricists/masters of ceremony including Chu Black, J-Smoov of Dark Leaf, TrenSeta, Big Al, Quiet Storm, Menace Clan's Jammin D and a host of others. In closing, the last Good Life Open Mic show was in September 1997 and was hosted by local Good Life emcee called Ink Rezin. The Good Life Health Food Centre closed in 1999. Regulars of the open mic night later founded Project Blowed, a hip-hop workshop.

He is a member of Freestyle Fellowship, Haiku D'Etat and Magic Heart Genies. Known for years as Mikah Nine, he changed the spelling to Myka Nyne with the release of A Work in Progress in 2003. Since Magic Heart Genies' album Heartifact in 2008, he has been credited as Myka 9. History Originally known as Microphone Mike in the 1980s, Myka 9 was a member of the MC Aces with Aceyalone and Spoon Iodine. He stated that he ghost-wrote two tracks on N.W.A.'s debut album N.W.A. and the Posse in 1987. As a co-founder of Freestyle Fellowship, he was instrumental in the scene at the Good Life Cafe in the early 1990s. Released in 1993, Freestyle Fellowship's second album Innercity Griots is one of the landmarks of Los Angeles hip hop. Their videos for \\"Inner City Boundaries\\" and \\"Hot Potato\\" brought them to the attention of a wider audience. Myka 9 was also featured on two tracks on Project Blowed compilation in 1994. In the late 1990s, Myka 9 came together with Aceyalone and Abstract Rude to form Haiku D'Etat. In 2008, Myka 9 formed Magic Heart Genies with J the Sarge and DJ Drez. Myka 9 has collaborated with The Wailers Band, Prefuse 73, Daddy Kev, Busdriver, Blue Sky Black Death, K-the-I???, and many others. He has worked extensively with producer and trumpeter Josef Leimberg, who produced the majority of It's All Love: American Nightmare and A Work in Progress. He has released two albums with Canadian producer Factor. In March of 2019, Myka 9 released the collaborative album In Motion with producer Adriatic. Legacy As one of the most stylistically advanced rappers at the Good Life Cafe, Myka 9 has had a profound influence on Los Angeles underground hip hop and freestyle rap in general. Discussing the influence of Myka 9's song \\"7th Seal\\" on Freestyle Fellowship's first album To Whom It May Concern... (1991), Ellay Khule said, \\"\\"7th Seal\\" blew everybody's mind for at least 2 years straight. People studied that shit backwards and forwards—even we don't know all those words. That made everybody say like 'I gotta get a tape out' or 'I can't rap like so- and-so no more. I can't be in 80s, now we movin' to the 90s.' That totally transferred our musical thought.\\" Drummer and producer JMD said, \\"Mike was like the Charlie Parker of all these motherfuckers.\\" Myka 9's style has been an influence to musicians far beyond the West Coast. In an interview, Pigeon John said, \\"For me Mikah 9 was like Miles Davis. He was a tall good looking dude, the girls always liked him and this dude just went on stage and there was no effort in him. He was a genius in what he did. He effected and influenced so many people in hip-hop including Mos Def, Talib Kweli, that whole scene. Years before Leaders of the New School, there are stories where Freestyle Fellowship, when they first came out and they went to New York. That whole shouting stuff, they had this ingenious way to do it and they had a backing jazz band before Digable Planets. Busta Rhymes ran up to him (Myka 9) afterwards and said \\"dude what kind of style is this,\\" and then lo and behold Leaders of the New School came out. So there's plenty of stories like that, but that's just like a taste of how potent that scene was at the Good Life.\\" Style Myka 9 is known for rapid-fire, jazz-influenced, melodic rapping, often incorporating singing and occasionally scatting into his songs. Myka 9 has said of his style: \\"My rhymes take the direction of a jazz trumpet or sax solo, like Miles or Trane, if I was to rhyme in the same meter as those notes... that’s my concept.\\" Film Myka 9 is featured in the documentary Freestyle: The Art of Rhyme and the Hip Hop Evolution Netflix series. He is also featured in the award-winning documentary This Is the Life, chronicling the music movement that was birthed at The Good Life Cafe in South Central, Los Angeles. The Good Life Cafe is the open-mic workshop where he first performed with Freestyle Fellowship in the early 1990s.

During the start of the 20th century, he was one of the leaders of the National Progressive Party, and one of the most important figures of Slovene liberal nationalism. Between 1896 and 1910, he was the mayor of Ljubljana (nowadays the capital of Slovenia), and greatly contributed to its rebuilding and modernisation after the 1895 earthquake.  In Austria-Hungary  Ivan Hribar was born in the Carniolan town of Trzin in what was then the Austrian Empire (now in Slovenia). He studied law at the University of Vienna, and made a professional career as the representative of a Czech bank in Ljubljana between 1876 and 1919. In the 1880s he became involved in politics, soon emerging as one of the leading figures of the Slovene national liberalism in Austria-Hungary. Together with his close political ally Ivan Tavčar he founded the National Party of Carniola, later renamed to National Progressive Party. From 1882 he served as city councillor of Laibach. In 1896 he was elected mayor of Ljubljana and became famous for implementing a large scale reconstruction of the town after the Ljubljana earthquake of 1895. He invited the architect Max Fabiani to make a new urban development plan for the town. This included the complete renovation of Prešeren Square and the area around the Triple Bridge (the Kresija Palace and the Philip Mansion), as well as the construction of the Dragon Bridge: all of these buildings are nowadays considered as central symbols of Ljubljana. Hribar's aim was to transform Ljubljana into a prestigious centre of all Slovene Lands and thus create a cultural and economic capital for the Slovenian people. He carried out a radical modernization of the city's infrastructure, including electrification and the introduction of trams. He also cleaned up the city's public finances. During his time in office Hribar often clashed with the ethnic German minority of Ljubljana on a number of issues. He remained in office until 1910, when the Emperor Franz Joseph I refused to confirm his reelection, because of his alleged role in anti-German riots two years earlier, in which two Slovenian students were shot by the Austro-Hungarian Army. He was succeeded by Ivan Tavčar. Between 1889 and 1908, he served as member of the Carniolan Provincial Diet, and between 1907 and 1911 as member of the Austrian Parliament. During his political activity in Austria-Hungary, Hribar was a great supporter of collaboration between Slovenes and other Slavic peoples, especially Czechs. He made many efforts to bring Czech investments to the Slovene Lands and he helped to establish several institutions on the Czech model, most famously the Sokol athletic association. He is also said to have based the reconstruction of Ljubljana so that the town would resemble Prague. Due to his Panslavic ideas, he was imprisoned twice during World War I, between August and December 1914 and between January and March 1915. Between April 1915 and June 1917, he was placed in house arrest in an estate in Land Salzburg, far from his homeland, in order to isolate him from his potential political allies. Together with Mihajlo Rostohar, Hribar also played an important role in the establishment of the University of Ljubljana.  In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia  After the end of World War I and the establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, he withdrew from party politics, although he remained active in public life. Between 1919 and 1921, he served as the Yugoslav Minister Plenipotentiary to Czechoslovakia. In 1921 he was appointed provisional representative of the Yugoslav central government in Slovenia, a post he held until the implementation of the new subdivisions in 1923. As a staunch advocate of Yugoslav nation building, he supported the centralist dictatorship of King Alexander. In 1932 he was appointed senator by the king and remained one until 1938 when he retired. In the late 1930s he voiced his support for a common political platform of all patriotic anti-fascist forces. In 1940, after Hitler's Invasion of France, he became one of the founders of the \\"Association of Friends of the Soviet Union,\\" which served as one of the rallying grounds for the later development of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. After the Italian annexation of Ljubljana Hribar was known as a passionate politician and a great Slovene and Yugoslav patriot. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, Hribar committed suicide (at the age of ninety) as a protest against the Italian annexation of Ljubljana. On 18 April, after returning home from a meeting with the Fascist Italian authorities, which had just offered him the mayorship of the city, he jumped into the Ljubljanica River, wrapped in the Yugoslav flag. He left a note with the verses from France Prešeren's poem The Baptism on the Savica: > Manj strašna noč je v črne zemlje krili, > kot so pod svetlim soncem sužnji dnovi. > Less fearful the long night of life’s denial > Than living ‘neath the sun in subjugation! Tributes After World War II, the embankment of Ljubljanica from which Ivan Hribar jumped into the river was named after him. On 30 August 2010, a monument to Hribar was unveiled on the Hribar Embankment (), next to the Shoemakers' Bridge (), not far from the place of his death. The monument was created by the Bosnian Slovenian sculptor Mirsad Begić.

The commission reported in 1894.Young, K. & Garside, P., Metropolitan London: Politics and Urban Change, (1982) The government headed by Lord Rosebery accepted the recommendations of the commission, but when a Conservative government under Lord Salisbury came to power in 1895 the reforms were almost entirely abandoned. Background The administration of the metropolitan area of London, and the possible reform of the ancient City of London had been prominent political topics since the 1830s. Recommendations by royal commissions given in 1837, 1854 and 1867 had largely been left unimplemented. The Local Government Act 1888 had set up a County of London which surrounded, but did not include, the square-mile and main business district of the City of London. London was therefore governed by the Corporation of London at its core and the London County Council for its metropolitan area. When the first London County Council was elected, the Progressive Party, closely allied to the parliamentary Liberals, took control. The first chairman of the LCC, Lord Rosebery, was strongly in favour of the unification of the city and county. Campaigning for the second county council elections in 1892, he set out the position of the Progressives: > The present arrangement by which a comparatively small district in the > centre of London is detached from London and held aloof cannot be > maintained. The object of parliament and of reformers must be that the city > should be united with London as soon as possible and with as little friction > as possible. Of all London reforms I lay infinitely the most stress on this, > because each can supply what the other lacks, because so many reforms are > contingent on it, and because you cannot have a complete municipality > without it. The Progressives increased their majority at the elections, and in November 1892 the council passed five resolutions seeking legislation to give the authority increased powers. It was resolved inter alia to seek: > The unification of London, by the removal of the division of the > jurisdiction between city and county, which now hampers every reform, but > especially the great questions of the public services, such as water, gas, > markets &c.; The Liberal Party gained control of parliament at the general election in July of that year, and in February 1893 the Government announced that a royal commission would be appointed to formulate a scheme for the unification of London. The President of the Local Government Board, H. H. Fowler, told the Commons that the commission was to have five members, of which one each were to represent the views of the City and the county council respectively. Accordingly, he wrote to both bodies in March suggesting the names of individuals who might be acceptable. The process was drawn out as the City was reluctant to cooperate. Membership and terms of reference The royal commission was appointed on 27 March 1893, the members being: *Leonard Henry Courtney, (chairman) Liberal Unionist member of parliament for Bodmin, who had held a number of junior ministerial posts in the Second Gladstone Ministry. *Sir Thomas Henry Farrer, Bt., London County Council alderman, former deputy chairman of the LCC and member of the Progressive grouping. He was elevated to the peerage as Baron Farrer later in 1893. *Robert Durning Holt, Mayor of Liverpool. In August 1893 he became the city's first Lord Mayor *Henry Homewood Crawford, Solicitor to the Corporation of the City of London *Edward Orford Smith, Town Clerk of Birmingham. Smith had led the campaign to obtain city status for Birmingham in 1889. The secretary to the commission was George Edward Yorke Gleadowe. The terms of reference were: > ..to consider the proper conditions under which the amalgamation of the City > and County of London can be effected, and to make specific and practical > proposals for that purpose. The commission's quorum was set at three members, and it was given full power to call witnesses and examine books, documents, registers and records. They were also permitted to visit and personally inspect any place in the United Kingdom that they deemed expedient. Conflict with the City From the beginning of the commission's sittings the City were reluctant to have any dealings with the body. The main objection was that the terms of reference suggested a fait accompli, with the commission being given the duty of devising a method of amalgamating City and county, not whether this should go ahead. A special committee of the Common Council was established and in November 1893 advised the corporation to cease giving evidence, as the proposed merger was: > ...a thing that should not be done and that the creation of a monster > municipality is a thing to be utterly avoided, and the annihilation of the > City equally to be avoided. The Attorney General, Sir Charles Russell attacked the City's attitude. The only reasons he could see for resisting the merger were a misplaced pride in the office of Lord Mayor and a \\"too sacred regard\\" for the City funds. Following the receipt of a letter from the President of the Local Government Board the City agreed to resume tendering evidence in December on the understanding that the terms of reference could be modified. However, in February 1894, the Corporation suddenly announced that they were withdrawing from furnishing evidence to the commission. The City's representative on the commission, H Homewood Crawford, resigned with immediate effect. The Common Council wrote an open letter to The Times explaining their actions: firstly the assurances given by the President of the Local Government Board regarding the terms of reference of the commission had not been honoured; and secondly the commission was refusing to hear their evidence regarding the position, powers and duties of the vestries and other local authorities outside the City. The London County Council submission In contrast to the City, the county council engaged enthusiastically with the commission and submitted detailed proposals for merging city and county. The main points were: *The administrative County of London and the City of London should form a single municipal area, and be designated the \\"City of London\\". The new area would constitute a county for all purposes. *The Corporation of the City and the London County Council would be replaced by a single body known as the \\"Mayor, and Commonalty and Citizens of London\\". *The new corporation would inherit all the property, powers, rights, privileges and distinctions of both bodies, as well as their debts and liabilities. *All electors qualified to elect county councillors would be citizens. *The corporation would consist of 118 councillors and 19 aldermen, identical in composition to the county council, and would be elected in the same way. *The Lord Mayor would be elected by the corporation in the same way as those of municipal boroughs. *A Deputy Mayor would be elected annually, and would perform the same functions as the chairman of a county council. *A \\"City Local Authority\\" would be formed for the area of the existing City, elected triennially by those qualified to elect county councillors. The authority would have the same functions as an incorporated vestry or district board established under the Metropolis Management Act 1855. *The High Sheriff of London would be chosen by the new council. *The Commissioners of Lieutenancy of the City of London would be abolished, and the Lord Mayor would be ex officio lord lieutenant and custos rotulorum of London. *Freedom of the City of London by patrimony, apprenticeship, purchase or gift would be abolished. The new council would be empowered to award honorary freedom as a mark of distinction. *The Honourable The Irish Society would be abolished and its charter repealed. Its property in Ireland would pass to the corporations of Derry and Coleraine, or to any elective county authority established in the future. The commission's report The commission issued its report on 29 September 1894. The report began by summarising the attempts to reform London government since 1835 and then laid out the general principles on which the area should be governed in future. There was general agreement among the witnesses called by the commission that a two-tier structure was needed, consisting of a \\"central body\\" and a number of \\"local authorities\\". The commissioners identified four questions that needed to be answered in order to carry out the reorganisation: # What should be the constitution and functions of the central body? # How should the powers, duties and property of the existing corporation be dealt with? # What should be the constitution and functions of the local authority for the City and other areas of the Metropolis? # What should the relationship between the local authorities and the central body? The main part of the report was accordingly divided into four sections, with detailed proposals on each of these issues. =Part 1. Constitution and functions of the central body= The new central body, which was to be called the Corporation of London, or more formally the \\"mayor and commonalty and citizens of London\\", was to be the legal successor of both the existing city corporation and the London County Council. In effect the status of city was to be extended from the old City to the area of the entire county, which would be redesignated as the City of London. The new city was to be governed by a council. Councillors The first matter addressed was the membership and method of election of the central body. There were two competing systems of election to be considered: annual elections by thirds as happened in boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and later legislation; or triennial elections of the whole body of councillors in the same way as county councils established under the 1888 act. The commission recommended that elections be held triennially. Aldermen Both borough and county councils contained a proportion of aldermen, co-opted by the councillors. In boroughs there was one alderman for every three councillors, in county councils the ratio was one to six. In place of co-option, two methods of electing aldermen were suggested to the commission. The first was that they should be nominated by the second tier of local bodies, while the second was that they be elected in the same manner as councillors, but for a six-year term. Neither suggestion found favour by the commission who recommended no change. Size of council The existing London County Council consisted of 118 councillors and 19 aldermen. The commission suggested that the City, which was represented by four councillors should have its representation increased to eight elected members. This was to reflect the fact that the in spite of its small population and area, the City's rateable value was one eighth of that of the whole of London. The resulting council would have 122 councillors, with a proportionate increase in the number of aldermen from 19 to 20. Office of Lord Mayor The post of Lord Mayor of London would be retained, and would not be restricted to the City alderman. Instead the council would have the power to elect any citizen of London as lord mayor, who would be titular chairman of the council. All ceremonies surrounding the mayoralty, and all rights and privileges were to be continued. The lord mayor was to be a justice of the peace, and also hold the offices of lord lieutenant and custos rotulorum of London. Town Clerk The head of staff of the county council was the deputy chairman, an elected member who received a salary for his services. In contrast the City employed a town clerk, a practice followed in municipal boroughs. The commission strongly recommended that a town clerk be appointed, independent of the parties on the council. Additionally, and beyond its terms of reference, it suggested the creation of a number of lower- tier councils headed by mayors. Although the amalgamation did not take place, the creation of metropolitan boroughs was achieved through the London Government Act 1899. Functions of the new corporation The commission called for a clear division of functions between the top tier corporation and the second tier local authorities. The basic principle was that the upper body should \\"be relieved of all administrative details for which its intervention is not really necessary\\" and the local bodies should \\"be intrusted with every duty they can conveniently discharge\\". Where there was a need for \\"uniformity of action\\", the corporation would be given the power to frame bylaws which would be administered by the local bodies. The corporation would have the power to intervene where the local authority was failing to carry out its duties. The corporation would inherit most of the powers of the county council, although the commission suggested that some of the LCC's duties would better be exercised by the local bodies. The existing City corporation was already the authority for a number of London-wide functions. These included being the sanitary authority for the Port of London, management of metropolitan markets, and the maintenance of Epping Forest and other open spaces. These would transfer to the new body. In addition the new corporation would gain powers over numerous administrative functions in the \\"old city\\", including bridges, street improvements, water supply and weights and measures. Functions of the local bodies The remaining duties of a municipality would fall to the second tier of local authorities. These powers would be transferred from the existing vestries, district boards and burial boards, along with various ad hoc bodies in charge of public libraries, bath and wash houses and the administration of the poor law. =Part 2. Powers, duties and property of the old corporation= The commission made arrangements for the transfer of the powers and rights of the City to the new London-wide corporation or to the new local authority for the area, and a scheme was also made for a number of residual matters. Transferred to the new corporation *Bridges *Markets *The Bridge House and Blackfriars Bridge Estates: any profits left after maintaining Blackfriars, London and Tower Bridge from these estates were to be used to maintain the other crossings of the Thames maintained by the London County Council. *The Clerkenwell Improvement Trust *The Holborn Valley Improvement Trust *Grain duty, which maintained a number of parks and open spaces: **Epping Forest **Burnham Beeches **Coulsdon Commons **Highgate Woods **Other places managed under the London Open Spaces Act 1878 *The Gresham Estates, that maintained: **The Royal Exchange **Gresham College *The City of London Court *The Guildhall *The Mansion House *The City of London School *Ward's City of London School for Girls *The Guildhall School of Music From these trusts and properties the new corporation was to pay an annual sum to the local authority for the old City for the upkeep of the Freemen's Orphan School, almshouses and other charitable institutions, along with donations to hospitals in the area. Ceremonial functions and shrievalty The new corporation was to succeed \\"without breach of continuity\\" to the powers and possessions the former City. The lord mayor would continue to enjoy the existing rights and privileges, and it would be lawful for the corporation to vote a sum to meet the costs of the office. The lord mayor and corporation were to retain the right of special access to the Sovereign, and to present petitions to the House of Commons. The Sheriffs of London would be chosen by the council of the new corporation in the same manner as those of counties corporate under the Municipal Corporations Act 1882. Freemen and liverymen The existing system of granting or succeeding to the freedom of the city was to be ended, with the privilege being in future a purely honorary title awarded by the council. The rights of existing freemen, or widows and children of freemen to access to City charities and schools was to continue. The administration of these bodies was to pass to the new local authority for the old city. The power of granting and fixing the number of liverymen of the various livery companies was to be transferred to central government. It was suggested that the privy council, which already possessed powers of granting royal charters to such bodies elsewhere, should take on this duty. Ecclesiastical patronage The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 had removed the powers of borough corporations to appoint clergy. These rights had been sold to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, with the money received invested for the benefit of the borough. The commission suggested the extension of the legislation to the city. Irish Society While the commission noted the county council's proposals for winding up the society, it was not in a position to make any recommendations on the matter. This was due to the fact that the City Corporation, the Irish Society and the livery companies were at the time involved in a court case in the Chancery Division of the Irish courts. City of London Police The commission recommended the ending of the separate police force for the City of London, and the inclusion of the area in the Metropolitan Police District. The City authorities had objected, fearing that insufficient resources would be allocated to protect the banks and other financial businesses of the area. The commissioners discounted this, finding that the business districts of provincial cities were adequately policed by borough police forces. Transferred to the local authority for the \\"Old City\\" The remaining powers and duties would be taken over the new local authority established for the area of the City. These included: *Baths and washhouses *Burial grounds *Charitable trusts *Poor law (although responsibility for registration of births, deaths and marriages would pass to central government) *Public libraries =Part 3. Constitution and functions of the local authority in the City and of the other local authorities in London= The commission recommended the establishment of a second tier of local authorities. One of these would cover the area of the old City, and would take over the local administrative functions of the existing corporation and Commissioners of Sewers. The rest of London would be divided into a number of areas for local administration. New local authorities would replace the existing vestries and district boards. Functions of the local authorities The functions the commission assigned to the local bodies included: *Sanitary administration, including building control and drainage. *Maintenance of main roads other than highways, small street improvements and regulation of tramways. *Valuation and registration of voters. *Provision and maintenance of small open spaces and mortuaries. *Powers over electric lighting and gas supply. *Exercise of powers to regulate overhead wires, food and drug sales. Constitution of the local authorities The commission considered the optimum number of members of the new local authorities. The existing Common Council of the City had 232 members, the Commissioners of Sewers had 92, while the maximum number of members of a vestry or district board was 120. It was felt that in each case the membership was too large, and did not allow for effective administration. On reviewing England and Wales outside London, it was discovered that the council of even the most populous municipal borough had no more than 72 members. Council of the Old City The report recommended the creation of a new local authority for the area of the existing City, to be known as the \\"Mayor and Council of the Old City\\". The electoral franchise would be the same as that for urban district councils under the Local Government Act 1894, and there would be 72 councillors. The area would be divided into 24 wards with three councillors elected for each ward. Councillors would have a three-year term of office, with one councillor in each ward retiring annually. They would be empowered to elect a mayor from among the citizens of the Old City. As a transitory measure, and in order to create a continuity with the abolished common council, the 26 existing aldermen would be entitled to sit as \\"additional life members\\" of the new council. It was expressly stated that aldermen were not to form a permanent part of the new body. Other local councils A number of witnesses had suggested that the councillors elected to the London-wide corporation should also be ex officio members of the local councils for the same areas as they represented. The commission accepted this proposal, which was felt would help the two tiers to keep in touch with each other. As the electoral districts for the new corporation (and the existing London County Council) were identical to the parliamentary constituencies, it followed that the areas of the new authorities would need to consist of one or more constituencies. The governing bodies of the new areas were to be called \\"councils\\", and were to be elected in the same way as an urban district council. Councils would have the right to elect one of their members as a mayor, but their areas would not have the status of a borough. All members of the councils were to be directly elected. There were to be no co-opted aldermen on the new councils, as none existed in the existing vestries, and the commission fund \\"no desire to adopt such an addition\\". The commission identified nineteen parishes which could form \\"areas of local administration\\" without any need for boundary changes: *Bethnal Green *Chelsea *Clerkenwell *Fulham *Hammersmith *Hampstead *Islington *Kensington *Lambeth *Mile End Old Town *Newington *Paddington *Poplar *St George, Hanover Square *St Marylebone *St Pancras *Shoreditch *Westminster, St Margaret and St John *Whitechapel Elsewhere in London there would be a need for a combination of existing areas which was considered to be \\"a very slight alteration to present arrangements\\". The commission did not make any further proposals on local areas as it was beyond their powers. =Part 4. Relations of the local authority of the Old City and of the other local authorities to the new corporation= The report concluded by setting out the relationship between the two tiers of local government. In part 3 the \\"personal connection\\" between the layers with members of the higher being ex officio members of the lower. In practical administration it was proposed that the local bodies should have as much independence as possible, but with the central authority acting to ensure that local government legislation should be consistently applied throughout the Metropolis. Some of the powers exercised by the county council might be transferred to the local councils. At the same time the new corporation would be given the powers of \\"supervision, appeal and control\\", and where local councils failed to carry out their duties could do so. The new corporation would also have to give consent for the local bodies to take out loans over a certain value. Reaction Reaction to the commissioners' proposals was sharply divided, largely on party lines, with Liberals very much in favour and Conservatives strongly opposed. =Liberal Party= A meeting of the London Liberal and Radical Union was held on 15 October to consider the commission's report. The meeting was addressed by three London members of parliament, James Stuart, Edward Pickersgill and Dadabhai Naoroji and a resolution was passed strongly approving the report. The resolution called for the government to bring in a bill in the next parliamentary session to bring the report into effect. The meeting went further than the commission, calling for the Metropolitan Asylums Board to be abolished and for the Metropolitan Police to be brought under the control of the new corporation. =Conservative Party= Lord Salisbury, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, gave an address in London on 7 November. Salisbury, who had led the government that passed the legislation creating the London County Council, had become one of its fiercest critics. Salisbury poured scorn on the royal commission, dismissing the members as either \\"Radicals\\" or ignorant of the ways and wants of London. He described the commissioners as \\"about the worst men\\" to study the problem of metropolitan government. He warned against the \\"evil of over- centralisation\\", and declared that the idea of a single corporation for the whole of London was unworkable. The \\"mammoth municipality\\" so created would be remote from its citizens, and the councillors were unlikely \\"to sympathize with the wishes of their fellow-men solely and mainly on the grounds of drainage and water supply\\". While he admitted of the need of a central body for some purposes, he spoke in favour of establishing a number of \\"municipalities of suitable size\\" which would encourage \\"local patriotism\\". He then launched an attack on the county council. He alleged that it was not representative of London, as only about forty percent of the electorate participated in elections, and those who did vote were not likely to be a \\"quiet, sober respectable citizens\\" but \\"people with strong feelings... cranks and crotcheteers\\". This resulted in the county council consisting of a \\"very large contingent of the intense portion of mankind... moved by their special, limited, fanatical views, or by their partisan or class antipathies\\". The county council had become, he said \\"the place where Collectivist and Socialistic experiments are tried. It is the place where a new revolutionary spirit finds its instruments and collect its arms\\". =London Municipal Society= The London Municipal Society, which was a pro-Conservative Liberal Unionist organisation, issued its response to the report on 4 November. The society condemned the \\"centralising tendency\\" of the proposals. They agreed on the principles set out in the report that a central body should be formed for certain London-wide matters and a number of smaller local authorities below it. They differed, however, on the distribution of powers, wishing the lower tier to consist of \\"strong and authoritative district councils or corporations\\", with no duties to de done by the central body that could not be done at the local level. =City of London= On receipt of the report it was angrily rejected by the City of London. They attacked what they described as proposals for a \\"puppet lord mayor\\" and the \\"spoilation of the City\\". The commission was accused of simply adopting the county council's scheme. The reputations of the members of the commission were attacked. Courteney was described as \\"a philosophical and occasionally unpractical chairman\\", Holt and Smith were dismissed as \\"two gentlemen whose experiences were avowedly to provincial administration\\" while Farrer was an \\"amiable nobleman and advowed advocate of the LCC\\". The Common Council of the City appointed a special committee to consider the report, and in January 1895 it presented its findings. The procedures of the commission were condemned and its conclusions described as \\"illogical\\". The Progressive Party on the county council was attacked, with its \\"real object\\" being to supplant the City corporation. The committee felt that, if they had acted properly, the commissioners would have been \\"bound to report in favour of a scheme for the government of London based on the establishment in the Metropolis of a number of separate municipalities.\\" The City's preferred scheme was \\"...the creation of separate municipal corporations, each consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors... (and) ...the creation of a central body or council composed of representatives from the whole of the metropolis, with the aldermen added by the several metropolitan municipalities in lieu of the undesirable system of co-optation.\\" =The Government= In December 1894, the Home Secretary, H H Asquith, attended a meeting in the same hall in which Lord Salisbury had spoken a month before. The meeting passed a resolution \\"earnestly appealing to the Government to give effect during the next session to give effect to the recommendations of the commissioners.\\" In reply Asquith promised to carry this forward. He also made a reply to Salisbury's comments, defending the members of the commission. Two of them were intimately connected with England's largest and best governed municipalities. It was hoped that the government of London might be raised to the level of that of Birmingham and Liverpool. Of the other two \\"Radicals\\" one was in fact a member of Salisbury's own political grouping and a dogged critic of the government, while the other was one of the country's most distinguished civil servants. Asquith attributed Salisbury's assault on the county council as regret at having created it, and his sudden interest in creating a number of boroughs was not due to \\"his love of municipalities, (but) to his hatred of the County Council.\\" He dismissed the scheme for a number of municipalities in scathing terms: > Why they cannot even agree whether they are going to have eight, ten, twelve > or fourteen of these mammoth municipalities. Where are they going to draw > their boundaries? Who wants them? So far as I can see, nobody in London. In March 1894, Lord Rosebery, former chairman of the London County Council, had become prime minister. Unsurprisingly, he was highly supportive of the commission's proposals. He gave a speech at the opening of Clerkenwell Town Hall in June 1895 where he declared that those who opposed unification were facing an \\"irresistible movement\\"... \\"not a matter of party clamour, but a natural force\\", To continue to maintain \\"two Londons\\" would be a \\"civil war\\". He announced that the bill for the unification of London was already in print, ready to be introduced to parliament. The bill, he stated \\"follows almost strictly and literally the recommendations of (the) commission\\". Change of government and the London Government Act 1899 In June 1895 a general election brought the Conservatives under Lord Salisbury to power. With the change of government, there was no prospect of any amalgamation legislation being introduced in the short term. The reorganisation of London government continued to be a political issue, however, particularly in the London County Council. In November 1895 the majority Progressive Party on the council promoted a motion seeking the transfer of powers from the City to the county. The opposition Moderate Party countered with a motion seeking to transfer powers from the county council to the vestries. In November 1897 the Conference of the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations passed a resolution calling on the government to pass legislation to decentralise local government in London. The government introduced the London Government Bill to the House of Commons on 1 March 1899. The bill sought to strengthen parish-level government in London at the expense of the county council, by dividing the whole of the administrative county of London into metropolitan boroughs. The metropolitan boroughs were to receive the transfer of some minor powers from the county council, and were to have councils each consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors. The Times, in an opinion piece, believed that the bill \\"had probably brought to its last stage the long controversy as to the form of government best suited to the needs of London.\\" The newspaper's correspondent continued that the bill would render \\"the attainment of such unity (of City and county) more difficult\\". The bill was vigorously opposed by the Liberals and Progressives, but received the royal assent on 13 July. The twenty-eight metropolitan boroughs came into existence on 1 November 1900.

These also he left in 1648, for the Franciscans. In Portugal he sided with the House of Braganza. Summoned to Rome by Pope Alexander VII, he taught theology at the College of the Propaganda, and afterwards church history at the Sapienza, and as consultor to the Inquisition. At Venice in 1667, during the week beginning 26 September, he held a public disputation, against all comers, on nearly every branch of human knowledge, especially the Bible, theology, patrology, history, law, literature, and poetry. He named this disputation, in his quaint and extravagant style, \\"Leonis Marci rugitus litterarii\\" (the literary roaring of the Lion of St. Mark); this obtained for him the freedom of the city of Venice and the professorship of moral philosophy at the University of Padua.

Major Eduard Tratt was the highest scoring Zerstörer pilot of the war with 38 victories and Gruppenkommandeur of II./Zerstörergeschwader 26 (ZG 26). He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. On 20 April 1944 he was posthumously promoted to the rank of Major. Career Tratt was born on 24 February 1919 in Würzburg. By 1937 Tratt was serving as a Fahnenjunker in the Luftwaffe. At the beginning of World War II, Leutnant Tratt was serving in 1 Staffel, Zerstörergeschwader 1 (ZG 1), flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy twin-engine fighter. After participation in Polish campaign Tratt took part in the Battle of France, and on 1 June 1940 claimed 3 Hawker Hurricane fighters over Dunkirk. Tratt was wounded in action on 12 August 1940 flying with 2./Zerstörergeschwader 2 (ZG 2) over England. Later in 1940 Tratt was transferred to 1./Erprobungsgruppe 210. The Gruppe, charged with introducing the new Messerschmitt Me 210 to operations, were, while awaiting delivery of the new aircraft, were pioneering the use of Bf 110 and Bf 109 fighter-bombers in low level, pin-point bombing attacks against British targets. Tratt flew numerous combat missions over England, and by the end of 1940 had 13 victory claims to his credit. Erprobungsgruppe 210, was redesignated Schnellkampfgeschwader 210 (SKG 210) in April 1941 and transferred to the East to take part in the assault on Russia. As part of 1./SKG 210 Tratt flew over the Central part of the front during Operation Barbarossa supporting the German army's encirclement and overrunning of Russian land forces in the Białystok and Minsk area in the early phase of the campaign. Tratt flew numerous ground attack and fighter missions during 1941 and claimed another 9 victories over Russian aircraft by the end of 1941. When I Gruppe were recalled to Landsberg-Lech to begin conversion to the Me 210 in January 1942, Tratt was then transferred to command 4 Staffel, Zerstörergeschwader 26 (ZG 26). On 18 February 1942 Oberleutnant Tratt was wounded by ground fire over Rzhev. He was then appointed Staffelkapitän, 6./ZG 26 in March, before being wounded again by enemy fire on 27 March. Oberleutnant Tratt received the Ritterkreuz in April 1942 and in May was transferred to command 2./ZG 2. He was then sent as Staffelkapitän to 1./ZG 1 in July 1942. In early 1943 I./ZG 1 flew against targets in the Stalingrad area, but then moved to Poltava, with attacks on Russian troop positions, supply and communications lines, and airfields. On 30 January 1943 Tratt suffered serious injuries (and his bordfunker Fw. Paul Rennefahrt killed) when he crash-landed his Bf 110 G-2 'RH+YK' after suffering engine damage North of Rowenki.'The Sting of the Luftwaffe'; J. Vasco, page 138 An Me 410A-1/U4 with a BK 5 autocannon finishes its attack on a USAAF B-17 When recovered, Tratt next commanded a special testing unit, Erprobungskommando 25, undertaking the operational testing and evaluation of new weapons for use against the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bomber offensive. With the increasing day bombing campaign over the Reich by the USAAF 8th Air Force, the Luftwaffe evaluated various means for its fighters to bring down more bombers during its incursions over occupied Europe. Erprobungskommando 25 was formed to test many and varied technical innovations to achieve that goal. One of these was the Me 410A-1/U4 (bomber destroyer) armed with a 50 mm BK-5 gun mounted underneath the fuselage. The gun, weighing some 900 kg, severely restricted manoeuvrability, though carrying some 21 rounds and having a recoil pressure of about seven tons. Hptm. Tratt claimed 2 B-17s during the summer of 1943, on 21 May 1943 with Epr. Kdo. 25, and one North of Baltrum on 13 June 1943 while Tratt briefly commanded Kdo.I./JG 1. On 11 October 1943 Hauptmann Tratt was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of the reformed II./ZG 26, flying the new heavy fighter versions of the Messerschmitt Me 410 from Hildesheim. He led the unit on Reichsverteidigung (Defence of the Reich) duties. As late 1943 ground on interceptions were infrequent, but by early 1944 the Zerstörer day fighters found the odds increasingly stacked as the massed American escort fighter accompanied the bombers all the way deep into Germany. During Tratt's tenure in command, II./ZG 26 sustained increasingly heavy losses to these fighter escorts. He claimed a P-38 south of Löningen on 13 November 1943 and on 29 November he shot down a B-17 bomber near Borkum as his 30th victory. On 10 February he claimed a P-38 near Ettenbrock, and on 11 February he claimed another 3 P-38 fighters, shot down in the Oberstein area. He recorded his final and 38th victory on 20 February 1944; a B-17 of the 452nd Bomb Group, 42-37951 \\"Mavoureen\\", which was also attacked by Oberleutnant Dürkopp of 6./ZG 26. Tratt was shot down and killed (with his gunner Ofw. Gillert) single- handedly attacking B-17's of the 91st Bomb Group near Nordhausen on 22 February 1944, flying a Messerschmitt Me 410B-1/U2/R4. S/Sgt R L Jackson, a right waist gunner of the 401st BS, 91st BG claimed a fighter that day which may have been Tratt. He was posthumously awarded the Eichenlaub on 26 March 1944 and was promoted to the rank of Major on 20 April 1944. Major Eduard Tratt was credited with 38 victories in over 350 missions. He recorded 18 victories over the Western Front, including 6 four-engine heavy bombers (5 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and 1 Consolidated B-24 Liberator) and 5 P-38 Lightnings. In addition he claimed 26 aircraft destroyed on the ground, 24 tanks, 312 road vehicles/transport and 33 anti-aircraft guns, 4 anti-aircraft batteries and 8 machine-gun nests.

Life Born at Meldola, near Forlì, in 1602, he was a Conventual Franciscan. He received his early education at Cesena and took degrees in Rome. He also frequented the 'studia' of his religious order in Bologna and Naples before assuming the duties of lecturer in Cesena, Perugia and Padua. He died in Meldola in 1673. He acquired a profound knowledge of scholastic philosophy and theology, being deeply versed in the writings of Duns Scotus. Nevertheless, he was an open-minded and independent scholar. As a controversialist he was harsh and arrogant towards his opponents, mingling invective with his arguments. His opinions on some philosophical questions were fiercely combatted by many of his contemporaries and especially by Matthew Ferchi and the Irish Franciscan John Punch. When presenting the second volume of his work on the \\"Sentences\\" to Alexander VII, to whom he had dedicated it, the pope asked him where he had learned to treat his opponent Ferchi in such a rough manner: Mastrius answered, :\\"From St. Augustine and St. Jerome, who in defence of their respective opinions on the interpretation of Holy Scripture fought hard and not without reason\\": the pope smilingly remarked, \\"From such masters other things could be learned\\". Works He was one of the most prominent writers of his time on philosophy and theology. His \\"Philosophy\\" in five volumes folio, his \\"Commentaries\\" on the \\"Sentences\\" in four volumes, and his Moral Theology \\"ad mentem S. Bonaventurae\\" in one volume were all published in Venice. Ponce in his treatise on Logic holds that with qualifying explanations God may be included in the Categories. Mastrius in combatting this opinion characteristically says, \\"Hic Pontius male tractat Deum sicut et alter\\". Mastrius had a well- ordered intellect which is seen in the clearness and precision with which he sets forth the subject-matter of discussion. His arguments for and against a proposition show real critical power and are expressed in accurate and clear language. His numerous quotations from ancient and contemporary authors and various schools of thought are a proof of his extensive reading. His works shed light on some of the difficult questions in Scotistic philosophy and theology. References * Claus A. Andersen, Metaphysik im Barockscotismus.

The brand is marketed as Clover Leaf in Canada. It is owned by FCF Co, Ltd. of Taiwan. History The Bumble Bee company began in 1899 when seven salmon canners in Astoria, Oregon, formed the Columbia River Packers Association (CRPA) under the leadership of Andrew B. Hammond. The Bumble Bee brand was introduced in 1910. The CRPA incorporated in 1924, and in 1946, Transamerica acquired a controlling interest in CRPA, Inc. After partnering with Wards Cove Packing Company in 1959, CRPA became the world's largest salmon packer. In 1961, Castle & Cooke acquired CRPA by merger and changed the name of the company to Bumble Bee Seafoods after its most famous brand. 1977 magazine ad for Bumble Bee tuna. Since the mid-1980s, Bumble Bee has gone through a number of ownership changes, beginning with Castle & Cooke's sale of Bumble Bee in a leveraged buyout to management in 1985. The management team, having paid off their leveraged debt before their 5-year goal, sold Bumble Bee to Pillsbury in 1988 contingent upon the president, Patrick Rose, and the management team staying on for five years, Pillsbury in turn, following its December 1988, hostile takeover by Grand Metropolitan PLC, was forced to sell the brand the next year to the Thai company Unicord. Bumble Bee went bankrupt in 1997, and was sold to International Home Foods, the former food unit of American Home Products. ConAgra Foods acquired International Home Foods in 2000; it sold Bumble Bee to the private equity firm Centre Partners in 2003. The Canadian company Connors Brothers Limited merged with Bumble Bee in 2004. The company was renamed Bumble Bee Foods, LLC in 2005. Centre Partners acquired the company again in 2008 and sold it to Lion Capital in 2010. In August 2015, Bumble Bee Foods was sued, accused of colluding with Chicken of the Sea and StarKist to fix prices. Bumble Bee's former CEO, Christopher Lischewski, was indicted in May 2018 for price fixing. After pleading not guilty he was found guilty of conspiring to fix prices of cans of tuna sold in the US from November 2010 to December 2013. Bumble Bee Foods was in talks to merge with Chicken of the Sea, but the merger was called off on December 3, 2015, after the Department of Justice expressed \\"Serious Concerns\\" raised by Olean Wholesale Grocery, a regional wholesaler that had sued the two companies over alleged Sherman Antitrust Act violations. =Recalls= In 1982, 40 million cans of Bumble Bee tuna were recalled due to holes in some cans. In 2007, a case of botulism caused by food produced at a Castleberry's Food Company plant owned and operated by Bumble Bee prompted a recall. In 2010, the USDA announced a recall of Bumble Bee chicken salad products due to pieces of plastic found in packaging. =2019 bankruptcy= On November 21, 2019, Bumble Bee Parent, Inc. and four affiliated companies filed for bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware The company has filed a motion to approve the sale of the company's assets. FCF Co, Ltd. acquired Bumble Bee in March 2020, for $928 million. =Worksite accident= On October 11, 2012, a worker died in a pressure cooker at the Santa Fe Springs, California Bumble Bee plant. In 2013, the company was fined nearly $74,000 and cited for six safety violations for the death and an additional $750,000 in fines, penalties and court costs in 2015. In April 2015, felony charges related to the accident were brought against the company, the director of plant operations, and the director of safety. The Los Angeles district attorney alleged that the accused willfully violated worker safety rules. To settle the criminal charges, Bumble Bee Foods agreed to pay $6 million, while two managers were to pay a total of $30,000 in fines. Canneries The company formerly ran a cannery in Astoria, Oregon, the Samuel Elmore Cannery, which had been designated a National Historic Landmark. The deteriorating structure was later slated for demolition, and the facility burned down in 1993. Today the company has canneries in Santa Fe Springs, California.

Founded in 1954, it occurs every two years at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. Young women from all over the United States and from around the globe are brought together at the ball and the surrounding parties, including daughters of Presidents of the United States, billionaire businessmen, diplomats, nobility, ambassadors and governors. Over the years the ball has benefited numerous charities from the International Debutante Ball Foundation including the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines', Coast Guard and Airmen's Club of New York, a social club for members of the United States Armed Services. The International Debutante Ball is considered the most prestigious debutante ball in the world. History The International Debutante Ball was founded in 1954 by socialite, philanthropist and humanitarian Beatrice Dinsmore Joyce, who was dubbed as the 'Duchess of Debs' and the 'Grand dame of debutante balls'. Joyce was inspired to create an American debutante ball after hearing Consuelo Vanderbilt make an observation about debutante balls and how lucky girls are who travel to debutante balls in different countries. The band leader Lester Lanin played the music from the start in 1954 until his last ball in the 1990s. Every guest was given a special \\"lanin hat\\". The first balls were held at the Plaza Hotel, with 35 girls from different countries and different states. As it grew with more girls participating, it moved to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Chairmen and Vice- Chairmen of the Debutante Committee of the International Debutante Ball include or have included: * Prince Ivan Sergeyevich Obolensky (Russian prince and grandson of John Jacob Astor IV - the founder of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel who died on the RMS Titanic. Astor was the richest passenger aboard the Titanic, and was thought to be among the richest people in the world at that time) * H.R.H. Princess Chantal of France * Barbara Anne Eisenhower (daughter of John Eisenhower, granddaughter of Dwight D. Eisenhower) *Susan Eisenhower (daughter of John Eisenhower, granddaughter of Dwight D. Eisenhower) *Mamie Eisenhower *Jacqueline Mars (Heiress of Mars Inc.) * H.S.H. Princess Marie- Christine of Liechtenstein *Duke and Duchess of Marlborough * Principe and Principessa Corsini * Prince Frédéric de Broglie * Count and Countess Christoph von Habsburg * The Marquess of Huntly * H.R.H. Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy Format Waldorf Astoria Hotel 58th International Debutante Ball, 2012 The International Debutante Ball is held biennially in the Grand Ballroom of the exclusive and historical Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City; although from 2016 it has been held at The Pierre in New York City due to the billion dollar renovations and temporary closure of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Each ball is preceded by a number of events, dinners and parties for the debutantes, including the Bachelor's Brunch, in private Manhattan members-only clubs such as the Colony Club, 21 Club or the University Club of New York. At the ball, each debutante is escorted by two men: one United States Military Academy cadet and one American civilian. According to New York magazine, the current organizer of the International Debutante Ball stated that \\"Every young lady should have two men.\\" Civilian escorts of the debutantes are young men of distinction, who are often scions of distinguished families, e.g. the Rockefeller family. Each debutante represents her state or country at the International Debutante Ball and a song, e.g. a national anthem or a song associated with the country where the debutante is from, is played by the renowned Lester Lanin Orchestra for the debutante when she is presented on stage. The military escort of the debutante also carries the flag of the country or US state where the debutante comes from. Each debutante must also greet approximately one thousand or more guests, from a close-knit social world, individually in the receiving line. Due to the fact that there are debutantes representing their own US state or country, the International Debutante Ball has been dubbed by publications as 'The United Nations of Debutante Balls and the private world of polite society'. Gold and pink are the main traditional colors of the ball. The Grand Ballroom is thus decorated with gold, silver (symbolising elegance) and pink (symbolising femininity) decorations, which Countess Bobrinskoy oversees at each ball biennially, and guests dine on edible gold leaves. The debutantes also receive flower bouquets containing pink roses and golden leaves. The dress code for civilian escorts and guests is white tie and formal wear. The ball is considered the \\"ultimate networking event\\" where members of the world's elite, rich and powerful meet up and mingle and where their daughters are prepared to enter the world of high society and foster lifelong international friendship with each other. The pink invitation that the chosen debutantes receive is written with gold ink and is therefore sometimes jokingly called the \\"Golden Ticket\\". The International Debutante Ball has been described as a ball which \\"most young women nowadays will never attend\\" and which has largely become a \\"who’s who of the upper class\\", with daughters of US Presidents, billionaire businessmen, European royalty, US governors, and diplomats receiving invitations. The scene at the International Debutante Ball has been described as a \\"Gatsby-style splendour in Manhattan's Waldorf- Astoria\\" (referring to F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby). Qualifications and selection In order to be presented as a debutante at the International Debutante Ball, debutantes must be recommended by a previous debutante of the International Debutante Ball. Debutantes must also be accepted by the Chairmen of the Debutante Committee of the International Debutante Ball and be able to afford the debutante presentation fee. Once chosen, each debutante is required to donate at least $22,000 to various charities for the US Military supported by the ball. Debutantes who are usually accepted are \\"women of distinction\\" who are highly accomplished young ladies in athletics, community service, academics, philanthropy and charity and are from well-connected families. Chosen debutantes are usually between the ages of 17 and 21 years old. According to the current organizer of the ball, the debutantes must be well-known with connections in the New York debutante and high society and as long as 'the debutante has the right connections, she has a chance of being invited'. According to The New York Times, the organiser of the ball stated that the ball does not want any \\"Tootsie\\" to participate or join \\"the club\\". Debutantes of the International Debutante Ball have been referred to as \\"members of a special and very select, elite, social group and of a carefully guarded social circle\\" and they have also been dubbed as \\"high profile\\" and \\"preppy\\". The debutantes include royalty, members of imperial families, heiresses, aristocrats and daughters of many political figures including Presidents of the United States, such as the daughters and granddaughters of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Richard Nixon, President Lyndon B. Johnson, President George H. W. Bush and President George W. Bush. Ivanka Trump (daughter of President Donald Trump) and Sasha and Malia Obama (daughters of President Barack Obama) have also been invited to be presented as debutantes at the International Debutante Ball in New York City. The International Debutante Ball has therefore been referred to as \\"the debutante ball with the strongest (and bipartisan) ties to the White House\\". Debutantes of the International Debutante Ball also include daughters of billionaire businessmen from the Forbes 400 and many Wall Street financiers. Notable past debutantes Over the years, the International Debutante Ball has had the honor of presenting many notable young women to society, including, but not limited to: * Tricia Nixon Cox, daughter of President Richard Nixon (1964) * Princess Mary Alexis Obolensky, daughter of Prince Alexis Obolensky (1964) * Serena Russell, daughter of Vogue Magazine editor Edwin Russell and Lady Sarah Consuelo Spencer-Churchill; great granddaughter of Consuelo Vanderbilt (1964) * Julie Nixon Eisenhower (1966), daughter of President Richard Nixon and granddaughter-in-law of President Dwight D.

He held many high-ranking offices in the Meiji government. Biography Born in Kyoto, Sanjō was the son of Naidaijin Sanjō Sanetsumu. He held several important posts in Court and became a central figure in the anti-Western, anti-Tokugawa sonnō jōi (\\"Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian\\") movement. When the coup d’etat of September 30, 1863, brought the more moderate Aizu and Satsuma factions into power, he fled to Chōshū. He returned to Kyoto after the resignation of shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu in 1867. The first administrative offices (Sanshoku) of the Meiji government were established on January 3, 1868: the Sōsai (President), Gijō (Administration) and San'yo (Office of Councilors). These offices were abolished on June 11, 1868, with the establishment of the Dajō-kan (Grand Council of State). In the new Meiji government, Sanjō was head of the Gijo, Minister of the Right (右大臣) (June 11, 1868 – August 15, 1871), and Chancellor of the Realm (Dajō-daijin) (August 15, 1871 – December 22, 1885). Sanjō was awarded Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum in 1882. On July 7, 1884, his title was changed to that of koshaku (prince) under the kazoku peerage system. Sanjō served until the abolition of the dajōkan system in 1885. After the Cabinet system was established, he became Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan. In 1889, when Prime Minister Kuroda Kiyotaka and his cabinet resigned en masse, Emperor Meiji only accepted Kuroda’s resignation and formally invited Sanjō to head the government. The Emperor refused to appoint a new prime minister for the next two months, making Sanjō the only Prime Minister of Japan (albeit interim) who also concurrently held the post of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal.After the Meiji Constitution was adopted in 1890, a new system was established: \\"In case of death, incapacitation, resignation or removal of the prime minister, a member of the cabinet shall serve as acting prime minister until the next prime minister is formally appointed.\\" Today Sanjō’s government is generally regarded as continuation of Kuroda’s.

Over time, several members of the Leveson-Gower family were made knights, baronets and peers. Hereditary titles held by the family include the dukedom of Sutherland, as well as the ancient earldom of Sutherland (created c. 1230) and the earldom of Granville (created 1833). Several other members of the family have also risen to prominence. Name Leveson-Gower is a well-known example of an English surname with counterintuitive pronunciation. The name Leveson is a patronymic from Louis or Lewis. In early modern times it was often rendered Luson: for example, in 1588, Elizabeth I received a letter from the King of Denmark concerning the depredations of Walter Leveson of Lilleshall Abbey, in which he is consistently referred to as Sir Walter Luson.State Papers Foreign, August 1588. Gower is a locational name, possibly derived from a place so-named in Kent, or from the Gower Peninsula in southern Wales.

Owned and operated by iHeartMedia, the station plays a Regional Mexican format. Its studios are located at the Tulsa Event Center in Southeast Tulsa and its transmitter site is in Owasso. History Before September 2005, the KIZS call letters were on the 92.1 frequency, broadcasting the KISS-FM brand of Top 40 programmed by other Clear Channel Communications- owned stations. Despite carrying the \\"KISSFM\\" brand name, KIZS was not always a Top 40 station. When 92-1 KISSFM launched, it was a Mainstream Top 40 station, competing with 106.9 KHITS. However, that format was not working in terms of ratings or revenue and the format was tweaked to an adult-leaning Top 40, described by some as a \\"90s and Now\\" Hot AC. After a year in this format and with the station still not garnering the success that Clear Channel would have liked, the format was once again tweaked, this time back toward Mainstream Top 40 in mid-2004, again with limited success. On September 23, 2005, KTBT moved from its 101.5 frequency to the much stronger 92.1 frequency in order to better compete with 106.9 KHITS. The format on the 101.5 frequency was then adjusted to the station Clear Channel Communications's current configuration, the \\"La Preciosia\\" brand featuring Spanish Oldies.

Status  Their state, like the state of the antipopes and the anti-bishops these appointed/created, is disputed. Many pseudocardinals were created during the controversy between the Holy See and the Holy Roman Empire during the Western Schism, and some of the cardinals switched their obedience. The legitimacy of the Popes of the different obediences during the Western Schism was not a clear matter for their contemporaries. The terms antipope, pseudocardinal and anticardinal were not used at that time, but they are now used by some modern Roman Catholic historians.

As per reports, trouble started when Vijay and his group touched the Devi Doli, which according to local belief should not be touched by someone from a local caste. The violence that erupted caused Vijay injuries to his head and ears. The mob also damaged his car by pushing it down a nearby gorge.

In the early hours of 30 December 2007, the robberies made a hole in the floor of the Bank of Kerala and got away with 80 kilograms of gold and 5,000,000 rupees, a total value of 80 million Indian Rupees.  Robbery  The bank was in the second floor of a building. The ground floor had a restaurant that was up for rent. The four-member gang rented the restaurant by giving an advance payment of about Rs. 50,000. They shut down the front door and placed a board saying that it was under renovation and would reopen on 8 January 2008. To make things more convincing, they even bought new furniture for the restaurant and much construction material for the site. Those who were watching the scene would have thought that repairs were going on. But they were cracking the first floor open, where the strong room was kept. They cracked it and made a big enough hole in the ceiling to the strong room. All the money they took was from some iron safes in the strong room which they cut open using a gas cutting machine. They took away gold and cash kept inside the safe. Malayala Manorama second headline & inner page news, 31 December 2007  Investigations by Kerala Police  The Kerala Police quickly formed a number of special teams. A special team led by Malappuram Superintendent of Police P. Vijayan and Deputy Superintendent K K Ibrahim conducted the investigation under the supervision of K.S.Jangpangi the Additional Director General of Kerala Police. The team consisted of Circle Inspectors of Police Vikraman and M.P Mohanachandran, SI Anvar Hussain and other officers from the subordinate ranks . It was a challenging task for Kerala Police to begin investigation as there was no evidence and no leads available for them to proceed with. Like many other bank robberies, it was done at the wee hours of a Sunday, since it is a holiday and it had come to light only on the next day. However, police made a computer graphic sketch image of the main culprit as illustrated by eyewitnesses and neighbors. The criminals tried to create an impression of Naxalite involvement in the robbery by quoting a sentence Jai Mao (praising naxalism) at the scene of the crime to deviate enquiry. There were many attempts by the culprits to divert the whole attention of the investigation team to Hyderabad. According to police officials, the criminals had purposely left one kilogram of looted gold in a hotel room in Hyderabad and made telephone calls from many different cities of India to mislead the investigation. The police team also monitored all telephone calls in the closest mobile signal towers at the location of the crime during the midnight hours of the incident. It was a big task monitoring more than two million calls. The help of various mobile service providers and IT professionals was also enlisted for the probe. And finally, it was the identification of a secret phone number used by the main suspects to communicate between themselves, that became the turning point in the investigation. = Arrests = The police team finally zeroed in on a house in Kozhikode where the accused were hiding and arrested four people including Joseph alias Jaison alias Babu, the kingpin of the operation along with three others including a woman and recovered 80% of the stolen gold and money. It is the first recovery in the crime history of Kerala of so much stolen property. The police further said that the remaining items would be traced within days as the accused have already confessed their location. The official arrest was formally announced on 28 February 2008 by K S Jangpangi, the additional director general of Kerala police. It is widely considered to be a credit to Kerala police that they solved the biggest robbery in the state within a short period and with the first recovery of so much stolen property. Crime inspired by Dhoom  The leader confessed that the crime was inspired by the Bollywood movie Dhoom. In the movie also, the robbers made a hole in the ground floor of the bank and got away with the valuables during the new-year event.

Life Under the influence of the philosopher Elme Marie Caro and of Père Gratry's book Les Sources, Ollé-Laprune, after exceptionally brilliant studies at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (1858 to 1861), devoted himself to philosophy. His life was spent in teaching, first in the lycées and then in the Ecole Normale Supérieure from 1875. As Frédéric Ozanam had been a Catholic professor of history and foreign literature in the university, Ollé- Laprune's aim was to be a Catholic professor of philosophy there. Theodore de Regnon, the Jesuit theologian, wrote to him: :\\"I am glad to think that God wills in our time to revive the lay apostolate, as in the times of Justin and Athenagoras; it is you especially who give me these thoughts.\\" The Government of the Third Republic was now and then urged by a certain section of the press to punish the \\"clericalism\\" of Ollé-Laprune, but the repute of his philosophical teaching protected him. For one year only (1881–82), after organizing a manifestation in favour of the expelled congregations, he was suspended from his chair by Jules Ferry, and the first to sign the protest addressed by his students to the minister on behalf of their professor was the future socialist deputy Jean Jaurès, then a student at the Ecole Normale Supérieure. The Academy of Moral and Political Sciences elected him a member of the philosophical section in 1897, to succeed Vacherot. Some months after his death William P. Coyne called him \\"the greatest Catholic layman who has appeared in France since Ozanam\\" (\\"New Ireland Review\\", June, 1899, p. 195). Works Ollé-Laprune's first important work was La Philosophie de Malebranche (1870). Ten years later to obtain the doctorate he defended before the Sorbonne a thesis on moral certitude. As against Cartesian rationalism and positivistic determinism, he investigated the part of the will and the heart in the phenomenon of belief. This work resembles in many respects John Henry Newman's Grammar of Assent. In his \\"Essai sur la morale d'Aristote\\" (1881) Ollé-Laprune defended the \\"Eudaemonism\\" of the Greek philosopher against the Kantian theories; and in \\"La philosophie et le temps présent\\" (1890) he vindicated, against deistic spiritualism, the right of the Christian thinker to go beyond the data of \\"natural religion\\" and illuminate philosophy by the data of revealed religion. One of his most influential works was the \\"Prix de la vie\\" (1894), wherein he shows why life is worth living. The advice given by Pope Leo XIII to the Catholics of France found in Ollé-Laprune an active champion. His brochure \\"Ce qu'on va chercher à Rome\\" (1895) was one of the best commentaries on the papal policy. His articles and conferences attest his growing influence in Catholic circles. He became a leader of Christian activity, consulted and heard by all until his premature death when he was about to finish a book on Jouffroy (Paris, 1899). Many of his articles have been collected by Goyau under the title \\"La Vitalité chrétienne\\" (1901). Here will also be found a series of his unedited meditations, \\"Omnia instaurare in Christo\\". Professor Delbos of the University of Paris published in 1907 the course which Ollé-Laprune had given on reason and rationalism (La raison et le rationalisme).

It consists of the Betic Cordillera (south Spain), and the Rif (North Morocco). The Gibraltar Arc is located at the western end of the Mediterranean Alpine belt and formed during the Neogene due to convergence of the Eurasian and African plates. Maximum altitudes of the region are reached at the Mulhacén peak (3482 m) at the Cordillera Betica. Precipitation is collected mainly by the Guadalquivir (Betics) and Sebou (Rif) rivers, which have delivered most sedimentary infill of the homonym sedimentary foreland basins.. Tectonic evolution North–south convergence of the Eurasian and African plates occurred during the middle Oligocene to the late Miocene, followed by northwest–southeast convergence from the late Tortonian to present. The Gibraltar Arc was formed during the Neogene due to a combination of western migration of the orogenic mountain front and late orogenic extension. The present convergence rate of the plates is estimated to be approximately 4.5 to 5.0 mm/year with an azimuth of 135–120°. The eastward Gibraltar Arc oceanic subduction system was active during the Early and Middle Miocene and has likely been inactive since. At this time, the Alboran Sea acted as a back-arc basin during the deposition of accretionary units. Since the Late Miocene, north–south to northwest–southeast continental convergence forced the subduction system along the arc that is oriented N20°E to N100°E. There is a lithospheric slab dipping east from the Strait of Gibraltar down to 600 km depth beneath the Alboran Sea. The crustal structure of the Gibraltar Arc is characterized by an arcuate bulge parallel to the arc, with crustal thinning occurring uniformly from the margins of the mountain ranges towards the Alboran Sea. The lithospheric mantle also has an arcuate bulge below the arc with extreme mantle thinning in the Alboran Sea, which is the typical structure of a back-arc basin located on the concave side of an arcuate mountain belt. A major left-lateral strike-slip fault zone, the Trans-Alboran Shear Zone, crosscuts the Gibraltar Arc with a NE trend from the eastern Betics to the western Rif. It was active during the Neogene, contributing to the westward advance of the Gibraltar Arc. Some of the previous fault segments are active, with left-lateral transpressive faulting and moderate to significant clockwise stress rotations. Oblique to this shear zone, there are two major right-lateral strike-slip fault systems, the Maro-Nerja and Yusuf systems. These trend NW and have transtensive deformation. The present-day stress pattern is probably the consequence of the interference between two stress sources: ongoing continent convergence and secondary stress sources from variations in crustal thickness, sedimentary accumulations causing loading, and the active strike-slip fault. Geology The Arc has two sections: the Internal and External Zones. The Internal Zone, which is located on the inner side of the arc, adjacent to the Alboran Sea, mostly consists of high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic rocks. The External Zone, located on the outer side of the arc, is mostly made of sediments deposited on the passive margins of Africa and Iberia. These rocks became highly deformed during the westward emplacement of the hinterland of the subduction system, with some units in the External Rif having undergone medium-pressure, low- temperature metamorphism during the Oligocene. Flysch units from the Cretaceous to Early Miocene are located between the External and Internal Zones. These were folded and thrusted during the westward migration of the Internal Zones and can be interpreted as the palaeo-accretionary wedge of the subduction system that was active during the Lower and Middle Miocene.

It is often called a style sheet, although that term also has other meanings. The standards can be applied either for general use, or be required usage for an individual publication, a particular organization, or a specific field. A style guide establishes standard style requirements to improve communication by ensuring consistency both within a document, and across multiple documents. Because practices vary, a style guide may set out standards to be used in areas such as punctuation, capitalization, citing sources, formatting of numbers and dates, table appearance and other areas. The style guide may require certain best practices in usage, language composition, visual composition, orthography and typography. For academic and technical documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in ethics (such as authorship, research ethics, and disclosure), pedagogy (such as exposition and clarity), and compliance (technical and regulatory). Style guides are specialized in a variety of ways, from the general use of a broad public audience, to a wide variety of specialized uses, such as for students and scholars of various academic disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business in general, and specific industries. The term house style refers to the individual style manual of a particular publisher or organization. Varieties Style guides vary widely in scope and size. =Sizes= This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade in web development and in desktop cascade over CSS styles. A short style guide is often called a style sheet. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a style manual or manual of style (MOS or MoS). In many cases, a project such as one book, journal, or monograph series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a publishing company, whose content is usually called house style. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an industry-wide or profession-wide style manual that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: * AP style for journalism and most forms of corporate communications * USGPO style or AGPS style for government publications * Oxford style and Chicago style for academic publishing and readership * APA style and ASA style for the social sciences * CSE style for various physical sciences * ACS style for chemistry * AMA style for medicine * Bluebook style for law Finally, these reference works cascade over the orthographic norms of the language in use (for example, English orthography for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as the different varieties of American English and British English. = Topics = Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as graphic design, including typography. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text. Style guides that cover usage may suggest ways of describing people that avoid racism, sexism, and homophobia. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover nomenclature, which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and ontologically sound (e.g., taxonomy, chemical nomenclature, and gene nomenclature). Updating Most style guides are revised from time to time to accommodate changes in conventions and usage. The frequency of updating and the revision control are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in reference work format, new editions typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the AP Stylebook is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

Biography  Tavčar was born into the poor peasant family of Janez and Neža née Perko in the Carniolan village of Poljane near Škofja Loka in what was then the Austrian Empire (now Slovenia). It has never been entirely clear who his father was. This disputed origin significantly influenced Tavčar's later personal life and political decisions. Tavčar's tomb at the Visoko estate He started schooling in his home village and continued in Ljubljana, from which he was expelled for disciplinary reasons. For a while he attended secondary school in Novo Mesto and eventually returned to Ljubljana. In 1871 he began studying law at the University of Vienna. He began his political career in the Provincial Assembly of the Duchy of Carniola, where he formed the core of a radical group of Slovene liberals together with Ivan Hribar. He became one of the leading members of the National Progressive Party and long served as the chief editor of the party journal Slovenski narod, succeeding Josip Jurčič. Between 1901 and 1907 he was member of the Austrian Parliament. In 1911, he succeeded Ivan Hribar as mayor of Ljubljana. In 1887, he married Franja Košenini, who later became the leading figure in the Slovene women's associations at the time. The marriage won Tavčar entrance to Ljubljana high society and enabled him to buy the Visoko manor in 1893 and to become the mayor of Ljubljana in 1911. The couple was the center of the social life in Ljubljana. They were both active in many organizations. Tavčar was very enthusiastic about sports and promoted cycling and athletics. He was one of the founders of the Sokol movement in the Slovene Lands. Tavčar remained in office as the mayor of Ljubljana until 1921, when he withdrew from public life after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. He spent his last years on his estate in Visoko, where he is buried.  Politics  Tavčar's estate in Visoko near Škofja Loka Ivan Tavčar was one of the main figures in the national- liberal political movement in the Slovene Lands which emerged in the late 19th century from the Young Slovenes movement. After the Slovenian National Movement split into the Catholic and Progressive wing in the late 1880s, Tavčar became one of the co-founders of the National Party of Carniola (renamed the National Progressive Party in 1905). He led the party together with Ivan Hribar until the end of World War I, when it was renamed the Yugoslav Democratic Party before merging into the State Party of Serbian, Croatian and Slovene Democrats. After 1918, Tavčar became a staunch supporter of Yugoslav unitarism; that is, the merger of the Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs into one Yugoslav nation. However, he did not play a major political role during the last years of his life due to his deteriorating health. Tavčar was also known for his polemics with the Catholic theoretician Anton Mahnič. In 1884, Mahnič published a satirical short story entitled Indija Koromandija, in which he mocked the progressive ideas of Josip Stritar, whom Tavčar admired. Tavčar responded with the dystopic novel named 4000, in which he described the sad and repressive society resulting from the implementation of Mahnič's integralist policies.  Literary work  Tavčar was influenced by the literature of the older generation of Slovenian nationalist and liberal authors, known as Young Slovenes (Mladoslovenci), among them Fran Levstik, Josip Jurčič, Josip Stritar, and Janko Kersnik. However, Tavčar was one of the first who fully adhered to Literary realism, rejecting the post-romanticism of the Young Slovenes. He started writing at the age of 17 in a school magazine and attained stylistic maturity in his latest works. He signed many of his works with the pseudonym Emil Leon. He often depicted rural environments of his native Upper Carniola, in which he saw a genuine and healthy counterpart to the somehow degenerate urban life. His most important work is Visoška kronika (The Visoko Chronicle), a short historical novel set in the period after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century. Another important work is Cvetje v jeseni (Blossoms in Autumn), a novel of a middle age urban dweller who moves to the countryside, where he falls in love with a younger girl. Although he never rejected his Roman Catholic religion, he was essentially an agnostic who adhered to an outward naturalistic world view. In his novels, he conveyed a critically optimistic view on the human condition, drawing from the tradition of Enlightenment and humanism.

At state level he served as a minister in the governments of Jack Lang during the 1920s. He was a miner before entering politics. Early life Cann was born at Shankhouse, Cramlington, Northumberland, England, educated at Cramlington National School and became a coalminer at eleven. His elder brother John Cann migrated to New South Wales in 1887. Cann married Catherine Roberts in 1890 and they had one daughter and one son. They migrated to NSW in 1900 and Cann worked as a miner near Lithgow and became involved in the Western Miners' Association. He served in the 30th Battalion of the first Australian Imperial Force from March 1916 until January 1918. Political career John Cann was a founding member of the Australian Labor Party and was elected to the NSW Legislative Assembly in 1891. Cann also was a member of the Labor Party, winning the Australian House of Representatives seat of Nepean at the 1910 election. He was defeated at the 1913 election. That year he unsuccessfully contested the NSW Legislative Assembly seat of Upper Hunter. In 1914, he won the 1914 Canterbury by-election, joining his brother John, then Colonial Secretary, in the Legislative Assembly. Cann held Canterbury at the 1917 election. In 1920 the district was abolished and absorbed into the new multi-member seat of St George; he was one of the members for St George until the abolition of proportional representation in 1927. He was Secretary for Mines and Minister for Labour and Industry from April 1920 to October 1921, when he became Secretary for Mines and Minister for Local Government until the defeat of the James Dooley government in December 1921. He was not reappointed when Dooley regained power some hours later. He became Minister for Local Government and Minister for Public Health in Jack Lang's first ministry in June 1925. He held the Local Government portfolio until March 1926 and Public Health until May 1927. He opposed Lang's leadership and as a result lost preselection for the 1927 election—he ran unsuccessfully as an independent. Later life In 1930, Cann ran unsuccessfully as a Nationalist for the seat of Lakemba. He died in the Sydney suburb of Strathfield, survived by his wife.

She was built by Aker Finnyards, Rauma, Finland in 2008, and entered service on the Kristiansand—Hirtshals route on 13 March 2008. Concept and construction Since its establishment in 1991, Color Line had operated various conventional ferries between Norway and Denmark. From 1996 onwards fast ferries were used to enhance the service during the northern hemisphere summer season. After an evaluation period of several years, the company began the planning process for two new large, fast, ferries in spring 2004, with the concept name Color Line Superspeed. The new ships were planned with a high enough service speed to eliminate the need for overnight crossings entirely and as a result they only include cabins for truck drivers and the ships crew. On 15 December 2005 the construction of the ships was awarded to Aker Finnyards' Rauma shipyard. Aker Finnyards had previously built what was at the time the world's largest cruiseferry for Color, and was at the time in the process of building , a slightly enlargened version of the Color Fantasy. The delivery times for the Color Line Superspeed vessels were originally planned for December 2007 for the first ship and April 2008 for the second. Due delays in construction, including technical problems with one of the auxiliary engines, the first ship, MS Superspeed 1, was not delivered to Color Line until 27 February 2008. Design MS Superspeed 1, without the aft extension of the superstructure, ported in Kristiansand Both the exterior and interior design of Superspeed 1 was handled by the Oslo-based Falkum-Hansen Design. =Exterior design= The hull shape of the Superspeed 1 has been designed for optimized speed performance and good sea-keeping characteristics. The ship has a fairly high, short bow, a rounded superstructure raising straight up to the bridge. The rear of the ship is relatively long, with a large entry space between the rear of the superstructure and the actual rear of the ship. The hull has been painted in the traditional dark blue of Color Line, with a red decorative stripe on top of the blue area. The blue hull paint raises upwards in an arch from the front of the ship, following the shape of the bow, and then arches all the way down to the waterline at the rear. A wide black stripe has been painted along the windows on deck 8, and the window frames of the bridge and the rears windows on deck 7 and 8 are also painted black. The funnel, located very close to amidship, is of a similar design to the funnels of and . =Interior design= Most passenger spaces on the Superspeed 1 are located on decks 7 and 8, above the multi-deck car deck complex and storage rooms. A two-deck high atrium is located by the entrance amidship.

Biography Adachi was the son of a samurai in the service of the Hosokawa clan of Kumamoto Domain. After the Meiji Restoration, he studied at the academy founded by Sasaki Tokifusa in Kumamoto. In 1894, during the First Sino-Japanese War he travelled to Korea, initially as a free-lance war correspondent, but soon established two Japanese-language newspapers, the Chōsen Jihō and the Keijō Shimpō. He was later charged with being one of the central instigators and organizers of the assassination of Korean Empress Myeongseong, along with Miura Gorō. Together with other members of the plot, he was arrested on his return to Japan, but was acquitted by the Japanese courts.Federeck. Japan Encyclopedia, page 6 In the 1902 General Election, Adachi was elected to the House of Representatives of Japan from the Kumamoto general constituency as a member of the Rikken Dōshikai, and was re- elected four consecutive times, serving until 25 December 1914, when he became Deputy Foreign Minister under the Ōkuma Shigenobu administration. He was elected again to the House of Representatives in the 1917 General Election, serving for another eight consecutive terms to 30 April 1942. The Rikken Dōshikai became the Kenseikai in 1916, which merged with the Seiyu Hontō in 1926 to form the Rikken Minseitō. Adachi was active in organizing these mergers and changes, and consistently promoted a hard-line policy towards China.Barshay. State and Intellectual in Imperial Japan, page 197–200 Adachi was selected to be Communications Minister under the cabinet of Katō Takaaki in May 1925, continuing under the 1st Wakatsuki administion until April 1927. He then served as Home Minister under the Hamaguchi administration from July 1929, continuing in the same post under the second Wakatsuki administration in December 1931. While as Home Minister, he supported bills granting voting rights to women in local elections, as a first step towards women’s suffrage on a national basis.Garon. Molding Japanese Minds, page 137 Adachi split with the Rikken Minseitō in 1931 over disagreements with Prime Minister Wakatsuki’s opposition to the aggressive steps taken by the Imperial Japanese Army in Manchuria and by Wakatsuki's economic policies, and brought down the Wakatsuki administration by boycotting cabinet meetings after his proposals for a coalition with the rival Rikken Seiyūkai were rejected.Metzler, The Lever of Empire, page 239 He formed a new political party, the Kokumin Dōmei in December 1932, together with Nakano Seigō. The new party advocated a form of state socialism or corporatism with government control of strategic industries and financial institutions, and the creation of a Japan-Manchukuo economic union. The party was absorbed into the Taisei Yokusankai in 1940. However, in 1942, Adachi did not run for re-election, and retired from public life. After the surrender of Japan, he was purged by the American occupation authorities. He died in August 1948 at age 83. References * Barshay, Andrew.

A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world.     * He plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and has been the team's captain since 2013. Since October 2017, he has been the top- ranked ODI batsman in the world and is currently 2nd in Test rankings with 886 points. Among Indian batsmen, Kohli has the best ever Test rating (937 points), ODI rating (911 points) and T20I rating (897 points). Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of \\"ODI specialist\\" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa. Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013, Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016). Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs captain as well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the second highest number of centuries and the highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. He holds the world record for being the fastest batsman to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 and 11,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the milestones in 175, 194, 205 and 222 innings respectively. Kohli has been the recipient of many awards such as the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) in 2017 and 2018; ICC Test Player of the Year 2018; ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012, 2017 and 2018 and Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2016, 2017 and 2018.http://m.wisdenindia.com/full- story.php?category=Wisden%20Cricketers’%20Almanack%202018&id;=296545& He was given the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, the highest sporting honour in India, in 2018. Kohli is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes. In 2018, Time magazine named Kohli one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2020, Kohli was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of $26 million. Virat Kohli is the only cricketer to feature in Forbes. Early life Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhavna. According to his family, when he was three-years old, Kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him. Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year- old Kohli was part of its first intake. Kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested that \\"Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club\\". Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time. Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, \\"He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he did and I was most impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldn’t leave.\\"Lokapally (2016), p. 19. In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice. Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as \\"a bright and alert child\\". Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon. Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month. Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, \\"I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory.\\" According to Kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, \\"My father was my biggest support. He was the one who drove me to practice every day. I miss his presence sometimes.\\" Youth and domestic career A younger Kohli as seen in this photo from 2010. Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He was the leading run-scorer for his team in that tournament with 172 runs at an average of 34.40. He became the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy and scored 390 runs in 5 innings at an average of 78 including two centuries and two fifties. In late 2004, he was selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. He scored 470 runs in four matches at an average of 117.50 with two hundreds and top-score of 251*. Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which Kohli finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches at an average of 84.11 with two centuries. In February 2006, he made his List A debut for Delhi against Services but did not get to bat. In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s and 49 in the three-match Test series. India Under-19 went on to win both the series. At the conclusion of the tour, the India Under-19 coach Lalchand Rajput was impressed with Kohli and said, \\"Kohli showed strong technical skills against both pace and spin\\". In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s. Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, at the age of 18, and scored 10 in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90. He went directly to the funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, \\"That is an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial,\\" while coach Chetan Chauhan lauded Kohli's \\"attitude and determination.\\" His mother noted that \\"Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, he looked like he was chasing his father's dream which was his own too.\\" He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season. In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80. In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run- getter with 146 runs from 5 matches. In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a hundred and a fifty. In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. Batting at number 3, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as the tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament. His century (100 runs from 74 balls) against the West Indies Under-19s in the group stage, which was called \\"the innings of the tournament\\" by ESPNcricinfo, gave India a 50-run victory and earned Kohli the man of the match. Kohli picked up a leg injury during the match, but recovered in time to play the quarter-final match against England Under-19s. He was instrumental in India's three-wicket semi-final win over New Zealand Under-19s in which he took 2/27 and scored 43 in the tense run-chase and was awarded the man of the match. He scored 19 against South Africa Under-19s in the final which India won by 12 runs (D/L method). ESPNcricinfo commended him for making several tactical bowling changes during the tournament. Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract. In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. In July 2008, he was included in India's 30-man probable squad for the ICC Champions Trophy which was to be held in Pakistan in September 2008. He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in Australia. He was in fine form in that tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20. International career =Early years= In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches, and his selection was called a \\"surprise call-up\\". During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series. He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12. He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match which helped India win the series. He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches. India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. After the Champions Trophy was postponed to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008. He batted only once in the two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings. Later that month in September 2008, he played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and top-scored for Delhi in both innings, with 52 and 197. The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead. In October 2008, Kohli played for Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against Australia. He made 105 and 16* in that match against a bowling line-up consisting of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Kohli was included in the squad for the home ODI series against England in November 2008 but was not given a chance to play, due to the inclusion of Tendulkar and Sehwag in the team. In December 2008, Kohli was given a Grade D contract in the annual BCCI contracts list which entitled him to receive . He was then dropped from the squad for the five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka in January 2009. Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in July–August 2009 held in Australia. He opened the innings for India Emerging Players in that tournament and finished as the leading run- getter with 398 runs from seven matches at an average of 66.33. He scored 104 off 102 balls in the final against South Africa Emerging Players at Brisbane to help his team win the match by 17 runs and clinch the title. At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the national selection committee, was impressed with Kohli and remarked \\"I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability.\\" Kohli has called this tournament as the \\"turning point\\" of his career. Kohli returned to the national team replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka. He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh. In the inconsequential group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and won his first man of the match award. Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven- match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches as injury replacement. He found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely. Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 111 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir, who made his personal best score of 150. India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1. The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli. Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010, which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches. Against Bangladesh, he scored 91 to help secure a win after India collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297. In the next match against Sri Lanka, Kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help India win the match with a bonus point having chased down their target of 214 within 33 overs. The next day, he scored his second ODI century, against Bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs. He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday, after Tendulkar and Suresh Raina. Kohli was much praised for his performances during the series in particular by the Indian captain Dhoni. Although Kohli made only two runs in the final against Sri Lanka in a four-wicket Indian defeat, he finished as the leading run- getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66. In the three-match ODI series at home against South Africa in February, Kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57. =Rise through the ranks= Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in May–June 2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour. Kohli made 168 runs at 42.00 including two fifties, but India suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. During the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket. He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26. Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in a full-strength Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75. His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15. Kohli batting in an ODI against New Zealand in December 2010 Despite the poor run of form, Kohli was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October, and in the only completed match of the series at Visakhapatnam, scored his third ODI century–118 off 121 balls–which helped India reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early. Winning the man of the match, he admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series. Part of a largely inexperienced team for the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession, in the first game, and followed it up with 64 and 63* in the next two matches. India completed a 5–0 whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team and made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad. He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries. Kohli was India's leading run-getter in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs at an average of 48.25 including two fifties, both in Indian defeats. During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for ODI batsmen, and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup. The inclusion of both Kohli and Raina in the World Cup squad resulted in speculations about which of the two batsmen will make it to the playing eleven. Days before India's first match of the tournament, Indian captain Dhoni indicated that the in-form Kohli is likely to be preferred over Raina. Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100, his fifth ODI century, in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut. In the next four group matches he had low scores of 8, 34, 12 and 1 against England, Ireland, Netherlands and South Africa respectively. Having returned to form with 59 against the West Indies, he scored only 24 and 9 in the quarter-final against Australia and semi-final against Pakistan respectively. In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83-run partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within the seventh over chasing 275. This partnership is regarded as \\"one of the turning points in the match\\", as India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World Cup for the first time since 1983. =Consistent performance in limited overs= Kohli fielding during a match in December 2010 When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they chose a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar and others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missing out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad. Kohli found success in the ODI series which India won 3–2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80. His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory, and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat. Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5 and was dismissed for 4 and 15 caught behind by Fidel Edwards in both innings. India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings, struggling against the short ball and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series. Initially dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August, Kohli was recalled as replacement for the injured Yuvraj, though did not play in any match in the series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80. His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches. In the last game of the series, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared a 170-run third-wicket partnership with Rahul Dravid, who was playing his last ODI, to help India post their first 300-plus total of the tour. Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings which was the only century in the series by any player on either team and earned him praise for his \\"hard work\\" and \\"maturity\\". However, England won the match by D/L method and the series 3–0. In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run-scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches including unbeaten knocks of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209-run partnership with Gambhir, and 86 at Mumbai, both in successful run- chases. Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included, ahead of Raina, in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. In competition with Yuvraj Singh for the number six position, it was not until the final match of the series that Kohli was selected in the team. He scored a pair of fifties in the match, with his first innings score of 52 ensuring India avoided follow-on. India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75. During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run- chase of 271, a knock which raised his reputation as \\"an expert of the chase\\". Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 and four centuries. =Ascension to ODI vice- captaincy= Having found a place in India's Test squad for the tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli top-scored with 132 in a tour match against Cricket Australia Chairman's XI to strengthen his case for a spot in the playing eleven ahead of Rohit Sharma. Batting at number 6, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed. While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat. In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series. India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as \\"the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists\\". Kohli fielding during a CB Series match against Australia in February 2012 In the first seven matches of the Commonwealth Bank triangular series against hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Kohli made two fifties–77 at Perth and 66 at Brisbane–both against Sri Lanka. India registered two wins, a tie and four losses in these seven matches, which meant that they needed a bonus point win their last group match against Sri Lanka at Hobart, to stay in contention for qualifying for the finals series. Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare. India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock, which included scoring 24 runs in an over by Lasith Malinga. Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as \\"one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time\\". However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series. With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli once again finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series. Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performance in Australia. Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, \\"Hats off to Virat Kohli for the way he played. We have to start looking towards the future. The selection committee and the Board felt Kohli is future captaincy material.\\" Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119. He scored 108 in the opening match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory, while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66. In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time. His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara. Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament. In July–August 2012, Kohli struck two centuries in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka–106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo–winning man of the match in both games. India won the series 4–1 and on account of scoring the most runs in the series, Kohli was named player of the series. In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48-ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and won the player of the series award. Kohli scored his second Test century at Bangalore during New Zealand's tour of India and won his first man of the match award in Test cricket. India won the two-match series 2–0, and Kohli averaged 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings. In the subsequent T20I series, he scored 70 runs off 41 balls, but India lost the match by one run and the series 1–0. He continued to be in good form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs from 5 matches at an average of 46.25. He hit two fifties during the tournament, 50 against Afghanistan in the group stage and 78* against Pakistan in the Super Eights, winning man of the match for both innings. He was named in the ICC 'Team of the Tournament'. Kohli's Test form dipped during the first three matches of England's tour of India with a top score of 20 and England leading the series 2–1. He scored a patient 103 from 295 balls in the last match on a slow and low pitch at Nagpur, keeping India in contention of drawing the series. ESPNcricinfo praised Kohli for having \\"demonstrated his growing maturity to play just the sort of innings his side required\\", while Kohli described his knock as \\"a learning innings\\". However, the match ended in a draw and England won their first Test series in India in 28 years. Against Pakistan in December 2012, Kohli averaged 18 in the T20Is and 4.33 in the ODIs, being troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly Junaid Khan, who dismissed him on all three occasions in the ODI series. Kohli had a quiet ODI series against England, apart from a match-winning 77* in the third ODI at Ranchi, with a total of 155 runs at an average of 38.75. Kohli scored his fourth Test century (107) at Chennai in the first match of the home Test series against Australia in February 2013. He said he was \\"feeling hungry for this series\\" after a poor run of form in the two previous series and also disappointed on getting out soon after reaching the hundred-run mark. India completed a 4–0 series sweep, becoming the first team to whitewash Australia in more than four decades. Kohli averaged 56.80 in the series and cemented his spot in the Test team. Kohli batting against South Africa in Cardiff during the Champions Trophy in June 2013 In June 2013, Kohli featured in the ICC Champions Trophy in England which India won. He scored a match-winning 144 against Sri Lanka in a warm-up match. He scored 34, 22 and 22 not out in India's group matches against South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan respectively, while India qualified for the semi-finals with an undefeated record. In the semi-final against Sri Lanka at Cardiff, he struck 58 not out in an eight-wicket win for India. The final between India and England at Birmingham was reduced to 20 overs after a rain delay. India batted first and Kohli top-scored with 43 from 34 balls, sharing a sixth-wicket partnership of 47 runs off 33 balls with Ravindra Jadeja and helping India reach 129/7 in 20 overs. India went on to secure a five-run win and their second consecutive ICC ODI tournament victory. He was also named as part of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC. =Setting records= Kohli stood-in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies after Dhoni injured himself during the match. India lost the match by one wicket, and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with Kohli being named the captain for the remaining matches. In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his first hundred as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India. Many senior players including Dhoni were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, with Kohli being appointed captain for an entire series for the first time. In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls, helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award. He batted on two more occasions in the series in which he had scores of 14 and 58 not out. India completed a 5–0 sweep of the series; their first in an away ODI series. Kohli had a successful time with the bat in the seven-match ODI series against Australia. After top-scoring with 61 in the opening loss at Pune, he struck the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur. Reaching the milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186-run second-wicket partnership with Rohit Sharma that came in 17.2 overs, Kohli's innings of 100 not out helped India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of one wicket with more than six overs to spare. This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket, while Kohli's knock became the fastest hundred against Australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase. He followed that innings with 68 in the next match at Mohali in another Indian defeat, before the next two matches were washed out by rain. In the sixth ODI at Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help India successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 and won the man of the match. He reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest ODI century by an Indian batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket. India clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck. At the conclusion of the series, Kohli moved to the top position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings for the first time in his career. Kohli batted twice in the two-match Test series against the West Indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 being dismissed by Shane Shillingford in both innings. This was also the last Test series for Tendulkar and Kohli was expected to take Tendulkar's number 4 batting position after the series. In the first game of the three- match ODI series that followed at Kochi, Kohli made 86 to seal a six-wicket win and won the man of the match. During the match, he also equalled Viv Richards' record of becoming the fastest batsman to make 5,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the landmark in his 114th innings. He missed out on his third century at Visakhapatnam in the next match, after being dismissed for 99 playing a hook shot off Ravi Rampaul. India lost the match by two wickets, but took the series 2–1 after winning the last match at Kanpur. With 204 runs at 68.00, Kohli finished the series as the leading run-getter and was awarded the man of the series. =Overseas season= India toured South Africa in December 2013 for three ODIs and two Tests. Kohli averaged 15.50 in the ODIs, including a duck. In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa and batting at 4 for the first time, Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998. Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald said, \\"The one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. I think he [Kohli] showed great discipline and responsibility. It reminds me of Sachin Tendulkar when they came here in 1996.\\" The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match. India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11. Kohli continued to amass runs on the subsequent New Zealand tour. He averaged 58.21 in the five-match ODI series in which his efforts of 111-ball 123 at Napier, 65-ball 78 at Hamilton and 78-ball 82 at Wellington all went in vain as India were defeated 4–0. He made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match Test series that followed including an unbeaten 105 on the last day of the second Test at Wellington that helped India save the match. India then travelled to Bangladesh for the Asia Cup and World Twenty20. Dhoni was ruled out of the Asia Cup after suffering a side strain during the New Zealand tour, which led to Kohli being named the captain for the tournament. Kohli scored 136 off 122 balls in India's opening match against Bangladesh, sharing a 213-run third-wicket stand with Ajinkya Rahane, which helped India successfully chase 280. It was his 19th ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh. India were knocked out of the tournament after narrow losses against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, in which Kohli scored 48 and 5 respectively. Dhoni returned from injury to captain the team for 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and Kohli was named vice-captain. In India's opening match of the tournament against Pakistan, Kohli top-scored with 36 not out to guide India to a seven-wicket win. He scored 54 off 41 balls in the next game against West Indies and an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls against Bangladesh, both in successful run-chases. In the semi-final, he made an unbeaten 72 in 44 deliveries to help India achieve the target of 173 with six wickets and five balls to spare. He won the man of the match for this knock which he called \\"my best T20 innings\\". India posted 130/4 in the final against Sri Lanka, in which Kohli scored 77 from 58 balls, and eventually lost the match by six wickets. Kohli had made a total of 319 runs in the tournament at an average of 106.33, a record for most runs by an individual batsman in a single World Twenty20 tournament, for which he won the Man of the Tournament award. Kohli and other senior players were rested for India's tour of Bangladesh ahead of the England tour. India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England despite leading it 1–0 after the first two Tests. Kohli fared poorly in the series averaging just 13.40 in 10 innings with a top score of 39. He was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging the ball to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times, while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers. Geoffrey Boycott said, \\"Jimmy Anderson ate him for breakfast. Every time Kohli came in, all he did was bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. He is playing with his bat too far away from his pad. He has to look at video replays of his technique and get back to basics\\". India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings. In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour on the last match of the tour. India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings. Kohli had a successful time during India's home ODI series win over the West Indies in October 2014. His 62 in the second ODI at Delhi was his first fifty across Tests and ODIs in 16 innings since February, and he stated that he got his \\"confidence back\\" with the innings. He struck his 20th ODI hundred–127 runs in 114 balls–in the fourth match at Dharamsala. India registered a 59-run victory and Kohli was awarded man of the match. Dhoni was rested for the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in November, enabling Kohli to lead the team for another full series. Kohli batted at 4 throughout the series and made scores of 22, 49, 53 and 66 in the first four ODIs, with India leading the series 4–0. In the fifth ODI at Ranchi, Kohli came in to bat with India at 14/2 in pursuit of 287. He made an unbeaten 139 off 126 balls to give his team a three-wicket win and a whitewash of Sri Lanka. Kohli was awarded player of the series, and it was the second whitewash under his captaincy. During the series he became the fastest batsman in the world to go past the 6000-run mark in ODIs. With 1054 ODI runs at 58.55 in 2014, he became the second player in the world after Sourav Ganguly to make more than 1,000 runs in ODIs for four consecutive calendar years. =Test captaincy= Kohli with coach Duncan Fletcher in January 2015, before the fourth Test in Sydney For the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014, Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time. Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings, becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut. In their second innings, India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli came in to bat when the Indian innings was reduced to 57/2 and started batting aggressively. He put on 185 runs for the third wicket with Murali Vijay before Vijay's dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top score. Kohli noted that his team was looking for a win and not a draw, while also saying that it was \\"the best Test I have been part of\\". Kohli's second innings ton was hailed by several Australian commentators as the finest fourth-innings performance they had ever seen in Australia. Dhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India. In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, Kohli was India's top-scorer in both innings. He made his personal best Test score of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years. Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the Test match. Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney. Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain. He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and India hung in for another draw. Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.

For his knock, he was awarded the man of the match award, his 20th in ODIs and first in a World Cup match. He was dismissed for 46 in India's second match against South Africa after another century partnership with opening batsman Dhawan. India went on to post 307 in 50 overs and register a 130-run victory in the match. India batted second in their remaining four group matches in which Kohli scored 33*, 33, 44* and 38 against UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively. India went on to secure wins in these four fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record. In India's 109-run victory in the quarter-final over Bangladesh, Kohli was dismissed by Rubel Hossain for 3 edging the ball to the wicket-keeper. India was eliminated in the semi-final by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for 1 off 13 balls, top-edging a short- pitched delivery from Mitchell Johnson. Kohli had a slump in form when India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test which ended in a draw and averaged 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1. Kohli ended his streak of low scores by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. India came back and won the next two matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four years.

India lost the series after a defeat in the final ODI and Kohli finished the series with an average of 49. India came back to beat the top-ranked South African team 3–0 in the four-match Test series under Kohli's captaincy, and climbed to number two position on the ICC Test rankings. He scored a total of 200 runs in the series at 33.33, including 44 and 88 in the fourth match at Delhi. =No. 1 Test team and limited-overs captaincy= Kohli started 2016 with scores of 91 and 59 in the first two ODIs of the limited-overs tour of Australia. He followed it up with a pair of hundreds–a run-a-ball 117 at Melbourne and 106 from 92 balls at Canberra–in the next two matches. During the course of the series, he became the fastest batsman in the world to cross the 7000-run mark in ODIs, getting to the milestone in his 161st innings, and the fastest to get to 25 centuries. After the ODI series ended in a 1–4 loss, the Indian team came back to whitewash the Australians 3–0 in the T20I series. Kohli made fifties in all three T20Is with scores of 90 not out, 59 not out and 50, winning two man of the matches as well as the man of the series award. He was also instrumental in India winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh the following month in which he scored 49 in a run-chase of 84 against Pakistan, followed by an unbeaten 56 against Sri Lanka and 41 not out in the Final against Bangladesh in two more successful chases. Kohli maintained his match-winning form in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India, scoring 55 not out in another successful run-chase against Pakistan. He struck an unbeaten 82 from 51 balls in India's must-win group match against Australia in \\"an innings of sheer class\\" with \\"clean cricket shots\\".

India went on to wrap the series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred–211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand–as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings. In the subsequent ODI series, Kohli set up two wins for India batting second with unbeaten knocks of 85 at Dharamsala and 134-ball 154 at Mohali. He then made 65 in the series-deciding fifth game at Visakhapatnam which India won.

Many former cricketers expect Kohli to break Tendulkar's batting records.

In 2018, Kohli was again listed 83 in the top 100 highest paid athletes in the world. In 2019, Kohli dropped 17 places to No. 100 on Forbes World's 100 Highest-Paid Athletes\\" list, making him the only Indian and the only cricketer to feature in that list. His earnings were estimated at about $25 million, earning $21 million from endorsements and the rest from salary and winnings. =Charity and Service= Kohli at a VKF charity event in June 2016 In March 2013, Kohli started a charity foundation called Virat Kohli Foundation (VKF). The organisation aims at helping underprivileged kids and conducts events to raise funds for the charity. According to Kohli, the foundation works with select NGOs to \\"create awareness, seek support and raise funds for the various causes they endorse and the philanthropic work they engage in.\\" In May 2014, eBay and Save the Children India conducted a charity auction with VKF, with its proceeds benefiting the education and healthcare of underprivileged children. Kohli has captained the All Heart Football Club, owned by VKF, in charity football matches against All Stars Football Club, owned by Abhishek Bachchan's Playing for Humanity. The matches, known as \\"Celebrity Clasico\\", feature cricketers playing for All Heart and Bollywood actors in the All Stars team, and are organized to generate funds for the two charity foundations. To promote the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) which is aiming to achieve a cleaner India, he along with Anurag Sharma and the Indian team cleaned the Eden Gardens on Gandhi Jayanti of 2016. In 2018, he tweeted a video in which Anushka Sharma is seen stopping a man littering the street from their car.

Genetic epidemiology seeks to derive a statistical and quantitative analysis of how genetics work in large groups.  Definition  The use of the term Genetic epidemiology emerged in the mid 1980s as a new scientific field. In formal language, genetic epidemiology was defined by Newton Morton, one of the pioneers of the field, as \\"a science which deals with the etiology, distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives and with inherited causes of disease in populations\\". It is closely allied to both molecular epidemiology and statistical genetics, but these overlapping fields each have distinct emphases, societies and journals. One definition of the field closely follows that of behavior genetics, defining genetic epidemiology as \\"the scientific discipline that deals with the analysis of the familial distribution of traits, with a view to understanding any possible genetic basis\\", and that \\"seeks to understand both the genetic and environmental factors and how they interact to produce various diseases and traits in humans\\". The BMJ adopts a similar definition, \\"Genetic epidemiology is the study of the aetiology, distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives and of inherited causes of disease in populations.\\"  History  As early as the 4th century BC, Hippocrates suggested in his essay “On Airs, Waters, and Places” that factors such as behavior and environment may play a role in disease. Epidemiology entered a more systematic phase with the work of John Graunt, who in 1662 tried to quantify mortality in London using a statistical approach, tabulating various factors he thought played a role in mortality rates. John Snow is considered to be the father of epidemiology, and was the first to use statistics to discover and target the cause of disease, specifically of cholera outbreaks in 1854 in London. He investigated the cases of cholera and plotted them onto a map identifying the most likely cause of cholera, which was shown to be contaminated water wells. = Modern history = Modern genetics began on the foundation of Gregor Mendel's work. Once this became widely known, it spurred a revolution in studies of hereditary throughout the animal kingdom; with studies showing genetic transmission and control over characteristics and traits. As gene variation was shown to affect disease, work began on quantifying factors affecting disease, accelerating in the 20th century. The period since the second world war saw the greatest advancement of the field, with scientists such as Newton Morton helping form the field of genetic epidemiology as it is known today, with the application of modern genetics to the statistical study of disease, as well as the establishment of large-scale epidemiological studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. In the 1960s and 1970s, epidemiology played a part in strategies for the worldwide eradication of naturally occurring smallpox.  Fundamentals  Traditionally, the study of the role of genetics in disease progresses through the following study designs, each answering a slightly different question: * Familial aggregation studies: Is there a genetic component to the disease, and what are the relative contributions of genes and environment? * Segregation studies: What is the pattern of inheritance of the disease (e.g. dominant or recessive)? * Linkage studies: On which part of which chromosome is the disease gene located? * Association studies: Which allele of which gene is associated with the disease? This traditional approach has proved highly successful in identifying monogenic disorders and locating the genes responsible. More recently, the scope of genetic epidemiology has expanded to include common diseases for which many genes each make a smaller contribution (polygenic, multifactorial or multigenic disorders). This has developed rapidly in the first decade of the 21st century following completion of the Human Genome Project, as advances in genotyping technology and associated reductions in cost has made it feasible to conduct large-scale genome-wide association studies that genotype many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms in thousands of individuals. These have led to the discovery of many genetic polymorphisms that influence the risk of developing many common diseases. The genetic epidemiology can also be skewed by the presence of evolutionary pressures that induce negative selection during molecular evolution. This negative selection can be determined by tracking the skewness of the distribution of mutations with putatively severe effects as compared to the distribution of mutations with putatively mild or absent effect.  Approaches  Genetic epidemiological research follows 3 discreet steps, as outlined by M.Tevfik Dorak: # Establishing that there is a genetic component to the disorder. # Establishing the relative size of that genetic effect in relation to other sources of variation in disease risk (environmental effects such as intrauterine environment, physical and chemical effects as well as behavioral and social aspects). # Identifying the gene(s) responsible for the genetic component. These research methodologies can be assessed through either family or population studies.

Background Philipps was the third of five sons of the Reverend Sir James Erasmus Philipps, 12th Baronet, of Picton Castle, and his wife the Hon. Mary, daughter of the Hon. and Rev. Samuel Best and sister of the fifth Baron Wynford. Born in Warminster vicarage, Wiltshire, and educated at Newton College, Newton Abbott, Devon, he became an apprentice with a Newcastle upon Tyne shipping firm, Dent & Co, in 1880 and upon completion of his apprenticeship he moved to the Glasgow shipping firm Allan & Gow in 1886. Shipping career With financial assistance from his eldest brother John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids Philipps set up his own shipping firm Philipps & Co in 1888, bought his first ship in 1889 and by the end of the nineteenth century the two brothers owned two shipping lines (King Line Ltd and the Scottish Steamship Company), a finance company (the London Maritime Investment Company), and the London and Thames Haven Petroleum Wharf. Taking advantage of a low share price, the brothers acquired shares in the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, and by 1902 Owen had become chairman and managing director of the line. Over the next twenty years he and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company acquired a controlling interest in more than twenty other companies, including the Union-Castle Line and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company. Acquisitions continued, culminating in the purchase of the White Star in 1927. Philipps was also a Member of Parliament until 1922. In 1923 he was created a peer as Baron Kylsant, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. Kylsant gained a reputation for acting unilaterally and autocratically, without consulting other board members. At the same time, the complex share structure of the companies within the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company group allowed him to continue his control of the group while hiding trading losses in individual firms by moving reserves around. In 1924 Kylsant also became chairman of Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilders. =Downfall and trial= In 1928 Kylsant applied to extend the government guarantee on a loan from the Midland Bank. When the application was refused, his shipping group defaulted on part of the next repayment. Much of the group's finances were based on Debenture Stock paying fixed interest at five per cent, and the main trustee of this stock was Kylsant's older brother, Viscount St Davids, who was unhappy with the way debenture stock was being issued, especially a £2,000,000 issue in 1928. St Davids made his concerns public, and the stock market values of the whole group declined sharply. Worried by these revelations and fearing an economic crisis, the British government appointed the accountant William McLintock to investigate the group's finances. His report issued in early 1930 revealed that Royal Mail Steam Packet Company had liabilities in excess of £10,000,000. This was enough for the banks to act, and much of Kylsant's powers were removed to trustees appointed by the banks, although Kylsant remained chairman until November 1930. In February 1931 Kylsant and his wife went to South Africa on holiday, and in his absence McLintock revealed that for several years the Royal Mail Steam Packet group had been paying dividends to stockholders despite trading at a loss. McLintock did not report this activity as fraudulent, although politicians used the term when the matter was discussed in the House of Commons. On his return from South Africa Kylsant was arrested and charged with making false statements with regard to company accounts for 1926 and 1927, contrary to section 84 of the Larceny Act 1861. The company auditor, Harold John Morland, was charged with aiding and abetting the same offences. Kylsant was also charged with issuing a document (the prospectus issued for the 1928 debenture stock issue) with intent to deceive, contrary to section 84 of the Larceny Act 1861. Both men were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. The trial took place in July 1931 and lasted for nine days, presided over by Mr Justice Wright. Both men pleaded not guilty to all charges. At the end of the trial, while both men were found not guilty of the first two charges, Kylsant was found guilty of the final charge of issuing a document with intent to deceive. Morland was discharged and Kylsant was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. After one night in prison he was released on bail, pending an appeal against the conviction. Kylsant's appeal against the conviction and sentence was heard in November 1931, when it was dismissed, and he subsequently served ten months in Wormwood Scrubs prison before being released in August 1932. In his obituary, The Times reported: Owen Philipps, circa 1905. Political career Since his time in Scotland, Philipps had been interested in politics and after two unsuccessful attempts to stand for Parliament he was elected as Member of Parliament for Pembroke and Haverfordwest as a Liberal in 1906. Reelected at the General Election in January 1910 he declined to stand again at the second general election in December 1910. It was immediately reported that he would seek the nomination for the West Carmarthenshire constituency, especially in view of his plans to live in the constituency, at Coomb Mansion, the birthplace of Lady Philipps. It was envisaged that the contest for the nomination would be between Philipps and John Hinds. However, he eventually trailed a distant third at the selection conference held at Water Street Chapel, Carmarthen, and the nomination went to Hinds . He later left the Liberal Party and joined the Conservative Party being elected unopposed as the Member for City of Chester at a by-election in 1916. Re-elected at the 1918 General Election he served until 1922, but did not stand again. Other offices and honours In 1904, Philipps was High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire and became a Deputy Lieutenant for Pembrokeshire in 1917, and Lord Lieutenant of Haverfordwest in 1924. In 1909, Philipps was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), later raised to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in 1918. In 1912 he was invested as a Knight of Grace of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem and raised to a Knight of Justice in 1916. On 14 February 1923, he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Kylsant, of Carmarthen in the County of Carmarthen and of Amroth in the County of Pembroke. Following his conviction he resigned all his knighthoods and lieutenancies; when he attempted to resign from his clubs, however, the offer was firmly refused. Personal life  Owen Philipps married at Carmarthen on 16 September 1902 Mai Alice Magdalene Morris, daughter of Thomas Morris, of Coomb, Carmarthenshire. They had three daughters. When Lord Kylsant died at the age of 74, the barony became extinct as he had no sons. His daughter Nesta Philipps, who had married George Coventry, later the 10th Earl of Coventry, inherited her father's house, Amroth Castle in Pembrokeshire.

After the disbandment of Joan of Arc, frontman Tim Kinsella reunited with the former members of Cap'n Jazz to form Owls. They recorded with Steve Albini at Electrical Audio in April 2001. Owls is an emo and indie rock record with comparisons to Ghosts and Vodka, Pavement and Captain Beefheart. Owls was released on July 31 through independent label Jade Tree. It was promoted with tours of the US and Europe, before the members focussed on other projects. Following an appearance at CMJ Musicfest in late 2002, Owls broke up. Background and production In mid 2000, Joan of Arc frontman Tim Kinsella reunited with the former members of Cap'n Jazz: Tim Kinsella on vocals, his brother Mike Kinsella on drums, Victor Villareal on guitar and Sam Zurick on bass, though without Davey von Bohlen, who was busy with the Promise Ring. They performed a one-off show for a fund-raiser, before working on songs for a week. Joan of Arc released The Gap in September that year through independent label Jade Tree. The supporting tour was unsuccessful, with tiny crowds and unrest within the band (which also featured Mike Kinsella and Zurick in the line-up). Joan of Arc played one more US show, alongside four in Japan in January 2001, before breaking up. Following the demise, Kinsella's band with the former Cap'n Jazz members was announced to the public as Owls. Owls was recorded by Steve Albini at Electrical Audio in April 2001; the recordings were mastered by John Golden at John Holden Mastering. Tim Kinsella said Albini was crucial to the project: \\"If we are gonna do this, record to tape, record all live -- it needs to be Albini\\". Composition Owls is an emo and indie rock album, which drew comparisons to Ghosts and Vodka (sharing members with Owls), the lo-fi energy of Pavement and the jazz blues of Captain Beefheart. Tim Kinsella's stream-of-consciousness, abstract lyricism was influenced by the work of E. E. Cummings, while his vocal styling was compared to Lou Reed and Neil Young. Villarreal bounced between plucked single-notes and borderline metal, while incorporating arpeggios. His guitar work recalled Don Caballero's American Don (2000) and the Ghosts and Vodka albums. Mike Kinsella's drumming, couple with Zurick's bass parts, anchored Tim Kinsella's more off-kilter vocal performances. The first two tracks \\"What Whorse You Wrote Id On\\" and \\"Anyone Can Have a Good Time\\" included percussion instrumentations, such as bongs and a tambourine. The latter sees Kinsella tackle the topics of heredity and matrimony, while its coda saw him pondering a conventional band format. \\"Everyone Is My Friend\\" is a math rock song, with jangling guitar parts and upbeat drum patterns, earning a comparison to Sunny Day Real Estate. \\"I Want the Blindingly Cute to Confide in Me\\", which is reminiscent of The Gap, epitomizes the record's various musical forms: pseudo- jazz rhythms, Andy Summers-esque guitar playing, intermittent vocal melodies and Kinsella's lyrical style. The title of the penultimate song \\"Life in the Hair Salon-Themed Bar on the Island\\" is in reference to a salon in New York City. The indie rock track incorporated influence from Frank Zappa; it exemplifies Villarreal's guitar abilities. The second half of the closing track \\"Holy Fucking Ghost\\" features several tempo changes. Release and reception =Promotion and touring= As Joan of Arc's break up was announced publicly in early May 2001, independent label Jade Tree announced the release of Owls' self-titled album. It was made available for pre-order from mid-May, and released on July 31. The Japanese edition, released through Quattro Disc, included the bonus track \\"Later\\". Between August and October, the group embarked on a cross-country US tour. Mike Kinsella left to focus on Owen, his solo project, and was replaced by Ryan Rapsys. Leading up to the Christmas period, the band embarked on a European tour. As a result of their van breaking down, the group missed six performances. Following this, the members focussed on other projects: Tim Kinsella spent early 2002 working on Friend/Enemy's debut album, and a new Joan of Arc album; Villareal and Zurick formed Precious Blood. Owls performed at CMJ Musicfest in October, disbanding sometime afterwards. =Critical response= Owls was featured in the A.V. Club's Best Music of the Decade \\"orphan\\" list (reserved for albums worth note that did not make the list). It also appeared on Rolling Stone list of the 40 best emo albums.

He assisted in producing the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum and the catechism of Peter Canisius. Life When twenty-two years old he entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at Cologne where six years later (1567) he became master of novices. In addition to this office he was appointed to give religious instruction to the upper classes in the Jesuit college at Cologne. In 1671 Busée left Cologne and went to Vienna, where he lectured on Scripture in the university and taught Hebrew at the Jesuit college. In 1584 Busée went to Rome at the directive of the General of the Society, Claudio Acquaviva, who had appointed him a member of a commission to draw up a system or plan of studies (Ratio Studiorum) for the entire Society. On his return to Vienna, Busée was made Rector of the College of Nobles and died while holding this position. Works He undertook to complete the large catechism of Peter Canisius by adding to it the full text of the scriptural and patristic references cited by the author. Peter Canisius himself encouraged this undertaking. The first volume appeared at Cologne in 1569, under the title Authoritates sacræ Scripturæ et sanctorum Patrum, quæ in summa doctrinæ christianæ doctoris Petri Canisii citantur. The following year, 1570, the work was completed, and was received at once with much favor. It consists of four volumes; for some unknown reason the last volume is lacking in the edition of the catechism, with notes by Busée, which was issued in 1571 by the house of Manutius of Venice, the descendants of Aldus Manutius. In 1577, a new edition revised and augmented by another Jesuit, Jean Hase, was published at Cologne in one folio volume, under another title: Opus catechisticum ... D.

He is remembered for his involvement in a plan to kidnap King James I of England, made together with another Catholic priest William Watson in the Bye Plot. He was executed at Winchester on 29 November 1603. Life He received his education at the English College, Douai, where he arrived on 6 August 1587. Two years later he went to the English College, Rome, and was one of a group of eight priests sent from there on the English mission in April 1592. Clark took an active part in the Archpriest Controversy: he was one of the \\"appellants\\", the 33 priests who signed the appeal against George Blackwell dated from Wisbech Castle, 17 November 1600. An attempt was made to give to the first clause of the breve of Pope Clement VIII, in favour of the appellants (5 October 1602), the appearance of restoring to them the canonical faculties which had been recently withdrawn. At this point Clark, with Watson and Thomas Bluet, were to be excluded. As it turned out, this solution to the dispute failed. In 1602, Clark was an inmate of The Clink prison in Southwark. He and Watson joined with others in what became called the Bye Plot against James I. On being apprehended Clark was committed to the Gatehouse Prison at Westminster, and then moved to the Tower of London. He and most of the other prisoners were then conveyed to Winchester under a strong guard, where they were tried and condemned on 15 November 1603. Other conspirators in the Bye Plot and Main Plot were pardoned; but Sir George Brooks, Clark, and Watson suffered the punishment of traitors at Winchester on 29 November. Sir Dudley Carleton, who was present, wrote: ‘The two priests that led the way to the execution were very bloodily handled.’ He added that Clark ‘stood somewhat upon his justification, and thought he had hard measure; but imputed it to his function, and therefore thought his death meritorious, as a kind of martyrdom’.

The interim analytical report was published in October 2007, and focused on the potential for the reduction of emissions from road transport. It concluded: * Urgent progress is needed from road transport to help meet emission cuts for the developed world of 60-80 percent by 2050 outlined in the Stern Review. * At low cost and by 2030, per-kilometre emissions from road transport could be reduced by 50 percent. * Electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles have the potential to make near complete decarbonisation of road transport a realistic long-term objective. * Biofuels have a role in the future UK fuel market, though demand must not be allowed to grow too quickly without robust environmental safeguards in place.

Educational packs of cards were being printed by the late eighteenth century, initially designed merely to inform, but later becoming playable games. Modern card games are often sold with non-standard distributions of suits and ranks. Unranked cards Cards from Astrophilogeon depicting the constellations of Argo Navis and Orion By the late eighteenth century, educational packs of cards were being printed without suits or ranks, such as The Elements of Astronomy and Geography Explained, published by John Wallis in 1795. These served as teaching aids rather than being playable games. Charles Hodges 1828 game Astrophilogeon was a deck of 60 cards showing 30 constellations and 30 terrestrial maps, with which players could play a game attempting to obtain corresponding pairs. An early 20th century dedicated deck card game was Touring, published in 1906, and inspiring Mille Bornes in 1954. Modern card games such as Dominion and Munchkin use neither suits nor ranks, instead having text and artwork which describes their effect in the game. Gameplay typically bears no resemblance to that of any traditional card games. Suits and ranks Uno is designed to be played with a dedicated deck of cards Some dedicated deck card games use the suit system of traditional playing cards, having a variety of suits, each containing a number of numbered or named ranks. Some ranks may have particular effects, like the numberless \\"skip a turn\\" cards in Uno, and the deck may contain additional suitless cards, echoing the jokers of traditional card games. The French card game Gnav and its variants use a deck of two suits, each suit containing the numbers zero through 12 and a number of creatures and objects (such as the \\"Owl\\" and the \\"Pot\\"). The deck can only be used to play the game it is designed for. The 1906 card game Rook was designed with coloured suits and an absence of face cards, to cater for Puritan and Mennonite players who disapproved of face cardsSeeking a Sanctuary: Seventh- day Adventism and the American Dream - Malcolm Bull, Keith Lockhart - Google Boeken and their association with gambling and cartomancy. Modern commercial card games which use suits and ranks are typically designed to be played with dedicated decks, giving the player a reason to buy a physical copy rather than learning to play the game with regular playing cards. The game of Uno, for example, is very similar to the traditional card game Mau-Mau, but uses custom iconography which would be harder to remember when using regular playing cards.

The Programme Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, told the November 1981 Central Committee plenum that work had begun on a new food programme. On 24 May 1982 Brezhnev told a Central Committee plenum that the goal of the new Food Programme was to enhance, and improve, productivity and output of Soviet agriculture. The basic elements of the planning mechanism and its administrative and organisational features of Soviet agriculture remained unchanged. The bureaucracy was reorganised to improve efficiency by establishing new institutions and investing more money on agriculture in the form of procurement prices. The Soviet Government would build roads, cultural facilities and consumer services close to unproductive farms to increase their productivity. This increased expenditure amounted to 30 billion rubles in 1983, and food subsidy on meat, milk, bread and potatoes increased by around 51 million rubles. In other words, when a Soviet consumer bought agricultural products, it would be less than half of what the Soviet Government invested on transporting the goods from the farms to the consumer facilities. The Food Programme was initiated in 1982 and would end in 1990 at the end of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. Mikhail Gorbachev, the then Central Committee Secretary Responsible for Agriculture, tried to establish nationwide committees which would oversee the reform's implementation. Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, objected to this, believing that the central ministries were fit to handle the reform's implementation themselves. According to Martin McCauley, the author behind Gorbachev, Tikhonov objected because he believed Gorbachev was trying to take his place as Council of Ministers chairman. During Brezhnev's November 1981 speech many Sovietologists thought that the Food Programme would decrease bureaucratic interference in Soviet agriculture. This, as was later proven, was far from the intended goal. While he did talk about \\"strengthening\\" the collective and state farms, he never said he would allow them to decide what to produce and how to produce it for instance. Instead of giving the farmers more independence, Brezhnev announced the establishment of two new bureaucratic layers. The first, the Agro-Industrial Associations, at the district, territory, province and autonomous level of governance would function as a \\"full-fledged and democratic management agency\\". Industrial commissions were established at the republic and union level. Fulfillment The Food Programme, which was ridiculed in the First World, increased grain yields between 1981 and 1986 by 3.4 percent, an increase from 1.9 percent for the period of 1965 to 1980. Agricultural output decreased in the period of 1986 to 1990, making the fulfillment of the Food Programme's goals unattainable.

The club currently competes in the National Premier Leagues Victoria 2. United is based at Wembley Park in Box Hill South.  History  Box Hill entered the Victorian Division 4 in 1925. In their first season they lost one game and drew once to become champion and win promotion to division 3 for the 1926 season. This season proved to be just as successful as they once again became league champions, this time losing just two games throughout the season. The following year they participated in the Victorian District League, where they finished fourth. The league was then suspended for three seasons before restarting in 1931. Box Hill were once again crowned champions and moved up to division one. After a couple of solid seasons placing mid table, the league was again suspended due to World War II. When the league restarted in 1946 Box Hill remained in Victoria's top division, until 1961 when they were relegated to division two. In this period Box Hill were once crowned champions (1948) and once finished runners up (1950). Over the next 20 years the club remained mainly in the second division, achieving promotion to the state league for just 4 seasons. From the 1983 season until they were relegated in 1990, Box Hill achieved 3 top 5 finishes. After being relegated it would take three seasons for Box Hill to return to the state league (which was now known as the Victorian Premier League) in 1995. Finishing ninth in 1995 and then twelfth in 1996, they then merged with Bulleen Lions and Brunswick Juventus to form the Bulleen Inter Kings. From their foundation in 1922 until their merger in 1996, Box Hill had won 9 championships and 11 promotions. Winning the Victorian State League title on just one occasion in 1948, and finishing in second place on two occasions. In late 2013, Box Hill were accepted into the National Premier Leagues Victoria, being placed into the second tier of the competition, the NPL Victoria 2. In 2014, the first season of the newly introduced competition, United finished in third place, just four points shy of the promoted North Geelong Warriors.http://www.foxsportspulse.com/comp_info.cgi?a=LADDER&compID;=298171&c;=1-10178-0-0-0 Rinor Muriqi was a stand-out for Pythagoras, scoring on 13 occasions.http://www.foxsportspulse.com/comp_info.cgi?c=1-10178-0-298171-0&pool;=1&round;=0&a;=STATS In 2015, the NPL2 was split into East and West conferences.

The following season was a tough one with the club finishing in 8th place, in danger of relegation at some parts of the season. In 2018, Box Hill finished in 7th place. At the end of the season, head coach Brian Vanega resigned. United appointed Con Karagiannidis as the new head manager in October 2018. Karagiannidis joined Box Hill having won the U20 NPL Victoria championship with Pascoe Vale.  Women's Team  Box Hill also fields a team in the Victorian Women's Premier League competition. Box Hill's women have enjoyed enormous success since the turn of the 20th century, winning the first of their nine WPL titles in 2001. Fourth in 2002, Box Hill then reclaimed its title in 2003, beginning a run of four straight championship wins. Heidelberg United defeated Box Hill in the 2007 Grand Final to break the winning sequence but Box Hill avenged that loss in 2008 to win back its crown and they were again successful in 2009 and 2010. After slipping out of the finals in 2011, Box Hill returned stronger than ever and became the first team in the modern era to not only win an unprecedented treble of the Minor Championship, Cup and Grand Final but also remained undefeated for the whole season. 2013 saw Box Hill finish second in the regular season before falling in the finals in straight sets. 2014 and 2015 has been a rebuilding period for the club with the team finishing mid-table. During the same period, Box Hill players have also claimed the WPL's Gold Medal for player of the season on five occasions; Louisa Bisby in 2003, Anthea Vardakas in 2005, Georgia Koutrouvelis in 2006, in 2008 there was a tie between Vardakas and teammate Daniela Digiammarco and in 2012 the Bisby capped off a brilliant season for the club winning the award for a second time in Box Hill colours.

This name remained until the conclusion of the 1991 season where they merged with Clayton Inter to become Box Hill Inter Soccer Club. In 1996 Bulleen Zebras and Brunswick Juventus coalesced with Box Hill to create the Bulleen Inter Kings for the 1997 Victorian Premier League season. Box Hill's juniors then became known as Box Hill-Clayton Inter Kings. At the time of the merger with Bulleen and Brunswick many of the original Clayton Inter club members broke away to form another club, Clayton SC, which changed its name to Waverley Victory Football Club in 2010. In December 2010 the club merged with Southern Suburbs to form Box Hill United SC, adopting the Pythagoras nickname associated with the club.

Life Educated first at St. Andrews, he joined Edmund Hay at the time of de Gouda's mission in 1562. In his company he then went to Rome, was there admitted into the Society of Jesus, and was eventually sent to Clermont College, Paris, in June, 1567, where Hay had become rector; and remained there in various posts, e.g. professor, head of the Scottish Jesuit Mission (1585), till 1590. During this period he was once engaged in a controversy with John Knox, against whom he wrote The Refutation of ane Answer made be Schir Johne Knox to ane letter be James Tyrie (Paris, 1573). Next year he discussed several points of religion with Andrew Melville privately in Paris. In 1585 he was summoned to Rome as the representative of France on the Committee of Six, who eventually drew up Father Acquaviva's first edition of the \\"Ratio Studiorum\\", printed in 1586. He was rector of Clermont College during the great siege of Paris (May to September, 1590). He had over a hundred scholars as well as a large community to feed, at a time when men were dying with hunger in the streets. After the Duke of Parma had revictualled the town (September), Tyrie was again sent to Rome, as French deputy for the congregation, which finally supported the government of Father Acquaviva. On his return in December, Tyrie was sent to the University of Pont-à-Mousson, as professor of Scripture and head of the Scots College, and two years later, on the successive deaths of Fathers Edmund Hay and Paul Hoffaeus, he was again called to Rome (22 May 1592), where he became Assistant for France and Germany, and played his part in the Sixth General Congregation of the Society of Jesus (1593). He also supported at Rome the vain endeavours in Scotland of the Catholic Earl of Huntly, Earl of Erroll, and Earl of Angus to maintain themselves, with King James VI of Scotland's connivance, by force of arms against the Kirk (1594). The earls asked and obtained a subsidy from Pope Clement VIII; and Father Tyrie's advice and opinion were constantly taken by both the papal and the Scottish negotiators. He also took steps to restore the Scottish hospital at Rome, which eventually (1600) became the Scots College there. Rare as it was to keep on good terms with adversaries in those days, Tyrie won praise from such men as David Buchanan, both for his ability and for his courtesy.

Technology The key to the system is the inner \\"pump\\" layer which is designed to move moisture from one face to the other by means of capillary depression\\"Capillary Rise and Depression\\" a useful demonstration of capillary surface tension effects Accessed November 12, 2008. (a surface tension effect causing fluid to move along a tube in the direction of increasing diameter). Combined with an outer layer that slows down incoming rain and wind, the \\"pump\\" layer is able to push water away from the wearer at a rate which should keep them dry. Since both components of the system are, by themselves, porous and air-permeable, the Analogy system is considerably more breathable than waterproofs relying on a non-porous layer. Unlike most \\"waterproof breathable\\" fabrics, Analogy can pass out liquid water as well as vapour. Unlike a conventional waterproof fabric, Analogy would fail a hydrostatic head test (if used to seal the bottom of a tube containing water, only a very short column could be supported). However, like fur, Analogy causes water to flow away from the body of the wearer and with water typically moving out faster than it arrives the garment is effectively waterproof from the wearer's point of view. Without a formal seal required, Analogy does not need the taped seams required by e.g. Gore-Tex rain-wear, and punctures in the outer layer do not compromise the action of the twin-component design. The \\"pump\\" layer and the shell fabric both rely on a durable water repellent treatment; this treatment in combination with the fabric structure of the \\"pump\\" layer creates the capillary depression effect that allows water to be driven away from the wearer. In common with other waterproof garment technologies, this water repellent treatment must be maintained in order to remain effective. Characteristics A factor of the two-fabric system is that it inevitably adds insulation, due to the requirement of the inner \\"pump\\" liner: being a fur substitute with a definite and designed structure it traps air as well as channeling water, which has an insulating effect. While this can be useful in cooler conditions it is less suitable for higher temperature and/or high activity conditions where overheating is more of a problem than an alternative which provides less insulation. Adding venting features to garments helps address this problem, but it is only a partial solution. Clothes made from Analogy can also be heavy compared to many examples of waterproof \\"hard shells\\" (but not necessarily to the combined weight of these and an insulating layer) and are relatively expensive.\\"Paramo - The People's Verdict\\" Outdoors Magic gear feature (October 17, 2002). Accessed November 12, 2008. Though the veracity of this may depend on the system it's compared to, as for many applications it means that fewer overall items need to be carried, potentially reducing the total garment count and expenditure. The weight issue has been addressed by the production of Nikwax Analogy Light which uses a lighter windproof outer with the same Pump Liner fabric, resulting in garments that are 19-20% lighter than the same style made in standard Analogy fabric. Examples of these are the Velez Adventure Light Smock, the Quito Jacket, the Vista Jacket and the Velez Adventure Trousers. The high \\"breathability\\" of the system makes it more suitable than conventional \\"hard shell\\" waterproofs for general use, as opposed to only being used in foul weather. This can offset the extra weight of the system, as extra garments for different conditions are less likely to be required.  Clothes and Market  The main user of Analogy is Nikwax's sister company Páramo with some other small specialist suppliers also producing garments from it. While Analogy clothes have a dedicated following among UK mountaineers, Paramo distribution and marketing to the mass market and outside the UK seems to be extremely limited.\\"Is Paramo the next Gore-Tex?\\" Outside Online Gearguy question (February 24, 2003).

Life He was the son of Peter Hay of Megginch (castle still standing), the bailie of Errol, and related to the earl of that title. In 1562 (being already a B. D., probably of Paris University), he was selected to accompany Father Nicolas de Gouda (Floris), S.J., on his mission (June to September, 1562) from Pope Pius IV to Mary, Queen of Scots, then lately returned to Scotland, Hay practically took charge of the mission, and conducted de Gouda amid many dangers to the queen's presence in a small room at Holyrood, while the majority of the court were hearing a Calvinist sermon. He acted as interpreter during the meeting, a full account of which will be found in de Gouda's report.John Hungerford Pollen, Papal Negotiations, 113-161. Before they returned to the continent, Hay had persuaded a small band of young men to accompany him and to offer themselves to the Society. They comprised William Crichton, Robert Abercromby (the future chaplain of Queen Anne of Denmark), James Tyrie, James Gordon, and two others. Hay made his studies at Rome rapidly. Sent to Innsbruck in 1564, he became confessor to the archduchesses of Austria, and gained such favour that he was with difficulty removed to Paris to become rector of Clermont College. He was already regarded as the probable head of the Scottish mission, and was commissioned to report to Rome on the varying fortunes of that country and its queen. In 1566, Pope Pius V resolved to send Bishop, afterwards Cardinal, Vincenzo Lauro to Mary as nuncio, and Hay was to accompany him. Hay started first (6 November) with the Piedmontese envoy Du Croc to see what could be done. Their object was to induce the queen to break with Murray, Lethington, and the other Protestant ministers. On 14 January 1567, the interview took place. The last Catholic sovereign of Scotland was receiving the last envoys from Rome to Holyrood. Lauro had ordered Hay to ask for the execution of the ministers, and this was demanding more than Mary was at all likely to grant. She answered that \\"she could not stain her hands with her subjects' blood\\". Before the envoys could return, the queen's refusal became relatively unimportant in consequence of the murder of Henry Darnley (10 February): a crime carried out with the connivance, if not the full consent, of the party in Mary's council from whose influence Father Hay had wished her to free herself. He was in Edinburgh at the time, and his reports are those of a friendly, well-informed witness. Like other representative Catholics, who were at that moment in touch with the circumstances of the case, he took a view adverse to Mary, and afterwards significantly described her as \\"peccatrix\\". Back in Paris, 15 March 1567, Hay was soon appointed provincial of France, till 6 September 1574, during the difficult years that covered the conflict between the University of Paris and Father Maldonatus. He was next rector of the college of Pont-à-Mousson, till 1581. He then returned again to Paris and filled the responsible post of consultor to the Province. In 1585, he was sent back the third time to Scotland with Father James Gordon, but was forced to return after two of three years, so harsh was the climate against Catholics. He was once more placed in high office, called to Rome, and chosen \\"assistant\\" for Germany and France, but his health was undermined by the severity of his missionary life, and he soon died.

Origins Seccotine originated in Ireland and was first marketed and patented in 1894 by John Stevenson MA (1851-1931). The original manufacturer was the commercial printing company McCaw, Stevenson & Orr Limited of Belfast (founded 1876). In the early 1960s a new product, Seccotine No.2 PVA general- purpose adhesive, was introduced. History The products and their registered trade marks for the UK and other clearly defined countries throughout the world were sold in 1968 to the English-based Royal Sovereign Group of Companies. Etablissements Martin, of Paris, which was already manufacturing in France under licence, acquired the trade marks for use in what were then the EEC countries, and certain other scheduled territories. Etymology It is one of the few trade names to have its entry and etymology recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary (1933 edition) where the name is explained as \\"apparently suggested by Italian secco, dry\\", though it is possible that the French sec (dry) may also have been an influence. Popular culture The recurring character Seccotine of the Franco-Belgian comics series Spirou et Fantasio is named after the glue. British popular ukuleleist George Formby sang about Frigid Air Fanny whose \\"teeth are not a grand set - she bought a second hand set - and stuck 'em in with Secotine\\" (1938). Billy Bunter is glued into a chair with seccotine in The Magnet #100 (1910). In the R. Austin Freeman novel As a Thief in the Night (1928) the use of seccotine rather than glue is used as a clue to identify a murderer. In the C.S. Lewis novel That Hideous Strength (1945) a character is described as having a cigarette \\"seccotined\\" to his lip. In the E.

The game was played on December 22, 2006, starting at 5 p.m. PST at 40,000-seat Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney, Nevada, where the bowl has been played since 1992. It was televised on ESPN. Starting in 2001, the Las Vegas Bowl featured a matchup of teams from the Mountain West Conference (MWC) and Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10), with organizers having first choice of bowl- eligible teams from the MWC, and the fourth or fifth choice (alternating annually) of bowl-eligible teams from the Pac-10. Game summary Riding a 9-game winning streak entering the game, a veteran BYU squad led by seniors John Beck, Curtis Brown, Jonny Harline, and Justin Robinson dominated Oregon from the start. Beck had 375 yards passing and accounted for 3 touchdowns, while Brown ran for an additional 120 yards and 2 touchdowns. Harline, an All- American tight end, earned MVP honors with 9 catches for 181 yards and a score. Robinson had 2 interceptions and led a strong effort by the Cougar defense that held the Ducks to just 120 yards through the first three quarters of play. Oregon had attempted to confuse BYU by alternating Dennis Dixon and Brady Leaf at quarterback, but it seemed to backfire, as the Ducks' offense never established any rhythm. Oregon's only touchdown came on a 47-yard pass play in the fourth quarter, after the game's outcome had already been decided. The victory was particularly satisfying for BYU, as Oregon head coach Mike Bellotti had made controversial comments prior to the game indicating that BYU (from the Mountain West conference) was not good enough to compete in the Pac-10.

She was specifically interested in economic matters and was involved in financial matters during Justin's reign. Early life According to the Ecclesiastic History of John of Ephesus, Sophia was a niece of Theodora,Lynda Garland, \\"Sophia, Wife of Justin II\\" the Empress consort of Justinian I. John of Ephesus did not specify the identities of her parents. According to the Secret History of Procopius, Theodora had only two siblings: her older sister Comito and younger sister Anastasia;Procopius, \\"Secret History\\", chapter 9, translation by Richard Atwater (1927) either one could be the mother of Sophia. Procopius identifies Comito as a leading hetaera of her age. John Malalas records that Comito (b. ca 500) married general Sittas in 528.PLRE, vol. 3, Sittas Sittas may thus be the father of Sophia.J. B. Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian (1923) Whether Anastasia ever married is unknown. During the reign of Justinian I (527–565), Theodora arranged for Sophia to marry his nephew Justin. According to the Chronicon of Victor of Tunnuna, Justin was a son of Dulcidius and Vigilantia.PLRE, vol. 3, Dulcidius Her father-in-law is also known as Dulcissimus in genealogical resources. Vigilantia and her brother, Justinian I, were children of Petrus Sabbatius and a senior Vigilantia, who was a sister of Justin I. Empress consort =Accession= Justinian I had several nephews but seems to have never appointed an heir. On the night of 13 November 565 - 14 November 565, Justinian I lay on his deathbed. Justin was his kouropalates and thus the only viable heir within the Great Palace of Constantinople. He managed to gain the support of the Byzantine Senate and was proclaimed emperor within the palace walls before the other members of the Justinian Dynasty were notified. The events were recorded by the court poet Flavius Cresconius Corippus. In his works, Corippus often translates her Greek name \\"Sophia\\" to its Latin equivalent \\"Sapientia\\". The meaning of both is \\"Wisdom\\", and the poet uses it as both a divine name and title for her. The accession speech of Justin makes specific mention of Sophia co-ruling with her husband, the presumption being that she already exercised political influence over him. Corippus records Sophia being in charge of the arrangements for the funeral of Justinian and claims she wove his shroud with scenes depicting the triumphs of his reign. Sophia took the name Aelia following the practices of the empresses of the Theodosian dynasty and the House of Leo. The name had not been used by the two preceding empresses of her own dynasty. She was the first Empress consort depicted on Byzantine coinage with royal insignia equal to her husband. They were also depicted together in images and statues, while the name of Sophia alone was given to two palaces, a harbor, and a public bath built in her honor. =Opposition= The main challenge to the new reign was another Justin, cousin to the new emperor. This namesake cousin was a son of Germanus and his first wife Passara. He had distinguished himself as a military commander and was thus seen as a better choice from a military point of view. According to Evagrius Scholasticus, the Emperor and Sophia initially welcomed their kinsman to Constantinople but before long had him exiled to Alexandria. In 568, the other Justin was murdered in his bed. John of Biclaro attributed the murder to supporters of Sophia. Evagrius claims that the head of the deceased was sent to the imperial couple who spitefully kicked it around.James Allan Evans, \\"Justin II (565-578 A.D.)\\" Evagrius is mostly negative in his account of Justin and Sophia, so should not be taken as an impartial source. In 568, Narses was removed from his position as prefect of Italia. According to Paul the Deacon, Sophia sent a message to the senior general that she had a more suitable position for a eunuch like him, as an overseer of the weaving girls of the gynaikonitis (women's quarters). Narses chose to retire to Naples, instead of returning to Constantinople as Justin had ordered him to do; Paul attributes this to the message from Sophia, implying that Narses was afraid of her. =Financial policy= Sophia also influenced the financial policies of Justin. Having inherited an exhausted treasury, they set about repaying the various debts and loans of Justinian to bankers and money-lenders. According to Theophanes, Sophia was in charge of financial records and payments, and restored the credibility of the royal treasury. The imperial couple tried to reduce expenses and increase treasury reserves. Evagrius, John of Ephesus, Gregory of Tours, and Paul the Deacon all mention this while accusing both Justin and Sophia of greed. She did research their debts and repaid them, which gained her contemporary praise.Garland, Page 43. =Religious policy= In 569, Justin and Sophia together reportedly sent a relic of the True Cross to Radegund. The event was commemorated in Vexilla Regis by Venantius Fortunatus. They also sent relics to Pope John III in an attempt to improve relations: the Cross of Justin II in the Vatican Museums, a crux gemmata, and a reliquary of the True Cross perhaps given at this point, has an inscription recording their donation and apparently their portraits on the ends of the arms on the reverse. This led to creation of poems by Venantius Fortunatus, which referred to Justin and Sophia as the new Constantine and the new Helena, and indicating Sophia's major role in the presentation of the relic. Garland, Page 48. The religious policy of the couple was controversial, however. According to John of Ephesus and Michael the Syrian, husband and wife were both initially monophysites who converted to Chalcedonean Christianity to gain favor with their uncle Justinian. During their reign, they attempted but failed to reconcile Chalcedonian and Monophysitic Christianity, which ended in renewed persecution of the latter. Meanwhile, their own beliefs were still in question. John of Ephesus himself was imprisoned during this persecution, presumably contributing to the hostile tone to Justin and Sophia in his writings. Regent Justin reportedly suffered from temporary fits of insanity and was unable to perform his duties as early as the fall of Dara to Khosrau I of the Sassanid Empire in November, 573. According to Gregory of Tours, Sophia assumed sole power over the Empire at this point. Evagrius Scholasticus reports that Sophia concluded a three-year truce with Khosrau on her own. According to bishop John of Ephesus, Sophia attributed the madness of her spouse to his failure to appreciate her status: :\\"The kingdom came through me, and it has come back to me: and as for him, he is chastised, and has fallen into this trial on my account, because he did not value me sufficiently, and vexed me.\\"John Eph., EH, 3.4 (tr. Payne Smith (1860) 171). During his bouts of madness, Justin lashed out at Baduarius. Even then, Sophia was able to persuade him to apologize and invite Baduarius to dinner. She had the windows of the palace sealed with bars after he attempted to throw himself out. As a Regent she required supporters, and she chose Tiberius II Constantine, Comes Excubitorum (Commander of the Excubitors), as her colleague in power. According to the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor, Tiberius was officially appointed Caesar by Justin on 7 December 574. He was also adopted by Justin and thus became his appointed heir. John of Ephesus records that Sophia and Tiberius, effectively co-regents, argued over financial policies: Sophia pursued decreasing royal expenses while Tiberius argued for the necessity of increasing them, particularly for military expenses. Both the Ecclesiastic history of John of Ephesus and the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor suggest that Sophia was planning to marry Tiberius at this point. His marriage to Ino Anastasia was seen as an offense to her. Ino and her daughters Constantina and Charito were not allowed to enter the Great Palace of Constantinople. They were instead settled in the palace of Hormisdas, residence of Justinian I prior to his elevation to the throne. According to John of Ephesus, Tiberius joined them every evening and returned to the Great Palace every morning. Sophia also refused to let the ladies at court visit Ino and her daughters as a token of respect to them. Ino eventually left Constantinople for Daphnudium, her previous residence. According to John of Ephesus, Tiberius left Constantinople to visit Ino when she fell sick. Her daughters are assumed to have joined her in her departure from the capital. In September 578, Justin II appointed Tiberius as his co-emperor. On 5 October 578, Justin died and Tiberius became the sole Emperor. According to John of Ephesus, Sophia sent Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople to Tiberius to convince him to divorce Ino, and offered both herself and her adult daughter Arabia as prospective brides. Tiberius refused. Sophia, though still an Augusta, was no longer the Empress consort. Later life Sophia retained her rank as Augusta and continued to hold a section of the palace for herself. Meanwhile, her rival Ino Anastasia was also proclaimed an Augusta. The situation was not to Sophia's liking, and John of Ephesus records further arguments over financial policy. Gregory of Tours records that Sophia took part in a conspiracy to depose Tiberius and replace him with another Justinian, younger brother of the Justin murdered in Alexandria. Tiberius reacted by seizing of much of her property, dismissing her loyal servants, and appointing replacements loyal to him. However her rank and presence in the palace remained. Theophanes records that in 579 Sophia retired to the Sophiai, a palace built in her honor, and says that she held her own minor court and was honored as the mother of Tiberius. On 14 August 582, Tiberius died. He was succeeded by Maurice, a general betrothed to Constantina. Gregory of Tours reported that Sophia had planned to marry Tiberius to regain the throne, but the marriage of Constantina and Maurice took place in Autumn 582. The ceremony was performed by Patriarch John IV of Constantinople and is described in detail by Theophylact Simocatta. Constantina was proclaimed an Augusta while both Sophia and Anastasia also kept the same title. John of Ephesus mentions that all three Augustas resided in the Great Palace, which would mean either that Sophia's retirement was temporary or that Theophanes misreported her status. =Death= Anastasia was the first of the three women to die. Theophanes places her death in 593. Constantina seems to have enjoyed better relations with Sophia than her mother did. Theophanes records them to have jointly offered a precious crown as an Easter present to Maurice in 601. He accepted their gift but then ordered it hung over the altar of Hagia Sophia as his own tribute to the church. According to Theophanes this was taken an insult by both Augustas and caused a rift in the marriage.Lynda Garland, \\"Constantina, Wife of Maurice\\" The Easter of 601 was also the last time Sophia was mentioned in our sources. Whether she survived to see the deposition of Maurice in 602 is unclear.  Children  Sophia and Justin had at least two children: *Justus. A son, died before 565. Buried in the Church of Michael the Archangel. *Arabia, a daughter. Married prior to the succession of her father to the kouropalatēs Baduarius. Her husband died c. 576 while defending Byzantine Italy from the Lombards.John of Biclaro, Chronicle They had a daughter, Firmina, whose fate is unknown.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 3 References Sources * Garland, Lynda.

Life  Savinšek was born in the Upper Carniolan town of Kamnik, then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (now in Slovenia), where he spent his youth. After finishing secondary school in Ljubljana, he studied medicine at the University of Ljubljana. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, he studied drawing under the tutorship of Rihard Jakopič and sculpture under the supervision of Karla Bulovec Mrak. During World War II and the Italian annexation of Ljubljana he was imprisoned in Ljubljana Castle for collaborating with the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. In 1942, he was later sent to the Gonars concentration camp. He was released after the Italian armistice in September 1943. A devout Roman Catholic, he decided to join the Slovenian Home Guard, an Anti-Communist militia collaborating with the Wehrmacht against the Partisan resistance. He deserted before the end of the war, thus securing himself an indulgent treatment by the new Titoist regime.Taras Kermauner, Skupinski portret z Dušanom Pirjevcem (Ljubljana: ZPS, 2002), 159 Between 1945 and 1949, he studied sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana. In the 1950s he emerged as one of the most prominent Slovenian sculptures of the younger generation, together with Drago Tršar, Boris and Zdenko Kalin. He continued his studies in Vienna, Italy, and Switzerland. In the late 1950s, he entered in conflict with the foremost Slovenian sculptor of the time, Stojan Batič, and founded his own artistic circle, composed not only of young and talented visual artist, but of literates and theatre people such as Dino Radojević, Herbert Grün, Saša Vuga, Dušan Pirjevec and Andrej Hieng.Taras Kermauner, Skupinski portret z Dušanom Pirjevcem (Ljubljana: ZPS, 2002), 159-160Dušan Pirjevec: slovenska kultura in literarna veda (Ljubljana: Filozofska fakulteta), 310-11 He died in Kirchheim, Germany, while attending a sculptors' workshop. He is buried in Žale Cemetery in Ljubljana.  Work  Savinšek dedicated himself mostly to figural art, with a preference in psychologically analytic portraits and female nudes.http://www.sloart.si/m-78-savinsek- jakob.aspx At the beginning of his career, he was influenced by the tradition of Slovene expressionism (especially the works of France Kralj), but he gradually turned to his own modernist style, in which he experimented with the volume of sculpture.http://www.sloart.si/m-78-savinsek-jakob.aspx He also produced some graphics and illustrations. His best-known works are the monuments to Julius Kugy in the Trenta Valley (in the Municipality of Bovec) and to Ivan Tavčar at his mansion in Visoko, and the monument War and Peace in Celje. He was also a renowned book illustrator. Among others, he illustrated books by Slavko Grum, Miran Jarc, and Alojz Gradnik. Gradnik admired Savinšek's work, and the two developed a close friendship. Savinšek also wrote poetry throughout most of his adult life, but he never published it. His manuscripts are kept in the National and University Library of Slovenia. The first collections of his poems was published in 2003 by the literary magazine KUD Logos, edited by the philosopher Gorazd Kocijančič.

Unlike SAGE, detection and purification of transcripts from the 5’ end of the messenger RNA require the presence of a trans-spliced leader sequence.  Trans-splicing Background Spliced leader sequences are short sequences of non coding RNA, not found within a gene itself, that are attached to the 5’ end of all, or a portion of, mRNAs transcribed in an organism. They have been found in several species to be responsible for separating polycistronic transcripts into single gene mRNAs, and in others to splice onto monocistronic transcripts. The major role of trans-splicing on monocistronic transcripts is largely unknown. It has been proposed that they may act as an independent promoter that aids in tissue specific expression of independent protein isoforms. Spliced leaders have been seen in trypanosomatids, Euglena, flatworms, Caenorhabditis. Some species contain only one spliced leader sequence found on all mRNAs. In C. elegans two are seen and are labeled SL1 and SL2.  TEC-RED Methods  TEC RED Protocol for attaining RNA signal Total RNA is purified from the specimen of interest. Poly A messenger RNA is then purified from total RNA and subsequently translated into cDNA using a reverse transcription reaction. The cDNA produced from the mRNA is labeled using primers homologous to the spliced leader sequences of the organism. In a nine step PCR reaction the cDNAs are concurrently embedded with the BpmI restriction endonuclease site (though any class IIs restriction endonuclease may work) and a biotin label which are present in the primers. These tagged cDNAs are then cleaved 14 bp downstream from the recognition site using BpmI restriction endonuclease and blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase. The fragments are further purified away from extraneous DNA material by using the biotin labels to bind them to a strepdavidin matrix. They are then ligated to adapter DNA, in six separate reactions, containing six different restriction endonuclease recognition sites. These tags are then amplified by PCR with primers containing a mismatch changing the Bpm1 site to a Xho1 site. The amplicons are concatenated and ligated into a plasmid vector. The clonal vectors are then sequenced and mapped to the genome.  Concatenation  Concatenation differences between TEC RED and SAGE Concatenation of the tags, as developed in 2004, is different from that seen in SAGE. The cleavage of the tags with Xho1 and mixture of the different samples, followed by ligation, form the first concatenation step. The second step uses one of the restriction endonucleases with consensus to the adapter molecule attached to the 3’ end. They are again ligated, and PCR is performed to purify samples for the next joining. The concatenation is continued with the second restriction endonuclease, followed by the third and finally the fourth. This results in the concatamer formed by the six endonuclease ligations containing 32 tags, arranged 5’ to 5’ around the Xho1 site. In SAGE, concatenation takes place after ditags are formed and amplified by PCR. The linkers on the outside of the ditags are cleaved with the enzyme that provided their binding and these sticky end ditags are concatenated randomly and placed into a cloning vector.  Advantages The advantage of TEC-RED over SAGE is that no restriction endonuclease is needed for the initial linker binding. This prevents bias associated with restriction site sequences that will be missing from some genes, as is seen in SAGE. The ability to have a snapshot of specific RNA isoforms allows the deduction of differential regulation of isoforms through alternative selection of promoters. This may also aid in the discernment of expression patterns unique to the SL1 or SL2 sequence. TEC-RED also allows characterization of the 5’ ends of RNA produced and therefore of isoforms that differ by the amino terminal splicing. The technology permits the determination and verification of all known and unknown genes that may be predicted as well as the 5’ splice isoforms or 5’ RNA ends that may be produced. Using TEC-RED in conjunction with SAGE or a modified protocol will allow discernment of the 5’ and 3’ ends of transcripts, respectively. The identification of alternative splice variants, and possibly the relative quantities, containing a trans-spliced leader sequence is therefore possible. Variations Two alternate techniques have been described that allow for 5’ tag analysis in organisms that do not have trans-spliced leader sequences. The techniques presented by Toshiyuki et al. and Shin-ichi et al. are called CAGE and 5’ SAGE respectively. CAGE utilizes biotinylated cap-trapper technology to maintain mRNA signal long enough to create and select full length cDNAs, which have adapter sequences ligated on the 5‘ end. 5’ SAGE utilizes oligo-capping technology. Both use their adapter sequence to prime from after the cDNA is created. Both of these methods have disadvantages though. CAGE has shown tags with addition of a guanine on the first position and oligo-capping may lead to sequence bias due to the use of RNA ligase.

Led by the Aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the deployment of the task force was seen as a show of force by the US in support of the beleaguered West Pakistani forces, and was claimed by India as an indication of US \\"tilt\\" towards Pakistan at a time that Indian forces were close to capturing Dhaka. The task force number is now used by the Seventh Fleet's submarine force. World War II On 15 March 1943 Task Force 44, generally made up of both U.S. and Australian cruisers and destroyers operating in the South West Pacific Area, was redesignated Task Force 74. For the landings on Hollandia in March–May 1944, the Task Force was made up of Australia, HMS Shropshire, and up to four destroyers, including HMAS Arunta.http://pacific.valka.cz/forces/tf74.htm#reckle; S.E. Morison, History of United States Naval Operations in World War II: New Guinea and the Marianas: March 1944 – August 1944, p. 47. Following a preliminary bombardment, the battle for Cebu City began on 26 March 1945, when the Allies launched Operation Victor II. Staging out of Leyte, where they had conducted rehearsal landings two days earlier, a large flotilla of cruisers and destroyers from the United States Seventh Fleet's Task Force 74 escorted the Cebu Attack Group to the island. Under the leadership of Major General William H. Arnold, the forces assigned to the operation consisted of the Americal Division's 132nd and 182nd Infantry Regiments, totaling about 5,000 men, were landed on Cebu island at Talisay Beach, southwest of Cebu City. The 182nd came ashore southwest of the city, while the 132nd landed at a wide gravel beach to the northeast opposite a palm grove. Meeting no Japanese opposition, the U.S. forces nevertheless suffered heavily from mines and booby traps as they crossed the beach. 1974 The Indian Ocean had, in the post-colonial cold- war situation in the 1960s, a strong British Royal Navy presence which projected Western interests in the region, and carried out security operations, as well as a deterrence against Soviet overtures in this area. The US navy's role at this time was confined to a limited presence in Bahrain. =Naval deterrence in the Indian Ocean= By the mid-1960s, with a failing economy, Britain began to roll back her role in the region. In a situation of political instability in the region, the Soviet Union also began a strong diplomatic initiative in the littoral states and initiated limited naval deployments, prompting fears that withdrawal of a western peacekeeping role would allow the [Soviet Navy] to fulfil its aspirations in the region, threatening western economic and military interests in the region and leading to loss of this area from the western sphere of influence. This lent a strong voice to the proponents of a strong US naval presence in the Indian Ocean, among them Elmo Zumwalt, as a diplomatic as well military deterrence against Soviet moves. US security interests in the Indian Ocean were, however, initially restricted to the countries of Ethiopia, Iran and Saudi Arabia. =The superpowers in the sub-continent= Both the United States and the Soviet Union had attempted to establish strong links with India following the Sino-Indian war of 1962, much to the disturbance of Pakistan especially since she was already in a military alliance with the United States. India had obtained substantial military and economic assistance from the United States towards the end of the conflict, but remained committed to the Non-Aligned Movement. Following the end of the conflict, Soviet offers of MiG fighter aircraft, as well as offers for transfer of technology and production facilities for military hardware confirmed India's preference for Moscow in terms of long-term security collaboration. In 1963, the US Navy deployed its first Carrier group in the Indian Ocean close to the Indian coast. However, since this was within a year of the end of the Sino-Indian conflict, where the US and Britain had offered substantial help to India, this was not interpreted as a diplomatic pressure or a show-of-force, and was in all probability training exercises to familiarise the navy with the Indian Ocean area. India had also at this time allowed the US to install intelligence gathering devices in the Himalayan peaks close to China, on the conditions of intelligence- sharing. By the end of the 1960s, the Vietnam War became the focus for the United States, with the Indian Subcontinent receiving much less attention. Peace in the region was assumed by the US to be the responsibility of the regional powers of India and China. =Bangladesh crisis= The Bangladesh Liberation War brought the Indian subcontinent back into the focus of the cold-war confrontations. The crisis had its roots in the economic and social disparities between the Eastern and Western wings of Pakistan and a dominance of the Eastern wing by the west since the creation of the nascent state in 1947 that increasingly divided the two wings through the 1960s During March 1971 Pakistan Army aided and advised by Bhutto and the army stopped political negotiation with East Pakistan's Sheikh Mujib, whose party Awami League won a landslide victory and majority seats in the Pakistan Parliament, and started a massive crackdown on the civilians and paramilitary police of the Eastern wing. By the last quarter of 1971, Pakistan was in a state of civil war, its Eastern wing locked in a ferocious battle for independence from the Western wing. The crisis precipitated in March 1971 when rising political discontent and cultural nationalism in East Pakistan was met by Yahya Khan with what has come to be called Operation Searchlight. The majority of East Pakistan's political leadership, including Mujibur Rahman, were arrested and, following brief confrontations and bloody battles between Bengali nationalists and some 40,000 strong Pakistani military, political order was forcibly and temporarily reimposed by the end of April amidst strong protests from India, the Soviet Union and other countries against the atrocities against the Bengali civilian population. The Pakistani army aided by paramilitaries from West Pakistan and local non-Bengali and some Islamic minded-Bengali political parties were killing large numbers of East Pakistanis. Depending on the source, the total death toll of the predominantly Bengali East Pakistanis during these events were either up to 500,000 people (according to independent researchers) or 3 million people (according to the government of Bangladesh). The massive and disproportionate crackdown by Pakistan Army forces engendered a sea of refugees (estimated at the time to be about 10 million, 13% of the entire East Pakistani population)Crisis in South Asia – A report by Senator Edward Kennedy to the Subcommittee investigating the Problem of Refugees and Their Settlement, Submitted to U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, 1 November 1971, U.S. Govt. Press.pp6-7 who came flooding to the eastern provinces of India. Facing a mounting humanitarian crisis, India started actively aiding and re- organising what was by this time already the nucleus of the Mukti Bahini. In the months before the war, both Pakistan and India attempted to shore up diplomatic support. On 9 August 1971, India signed a twenty-year co-operation treaty with the Soviet Union, followed by a six-nation tour of Europe and USA by Indira Gandhi in October. This tour was intended to demonstrate India's professed neutrality despite the Indo-Soviet treaty, as well as to highlight the refugee problem faced by India. Pakistan came under increasing criticism from India, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Europe as the plight of the refugees and their impact on the Indian economy were highlighted by Indira Gandhi in the UN and on a number of global tours. However, the United States and China showed little interest in the crisis and actively opposed aid, intervention or support to the Mukti BahiniRemarks of President Richard M Nixon on 10 April 1971 at State Department Signing of Biological Weapon's Convention. > Every Great Power must follow the principle that it should not directly or > indirectly allow any other nation to use force or armed aggression against > one of its neighbours. . USIS Text, pp 1–2. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto at this time led a high level delegation to Beijing to obtain commitment from China of support in case of Indian intervention while Pakistan pressed at the UN for an International Peacekeeping Force for the India-East Pakistan border. The Pakistani efforts at the UN were however blocked by the Soviet Union in the Security council. India's aid to the Mukti Bahini continued unabated, and fighting between the Mukti Bahini and the Pakistani Forces grew increasingly vicious. Third Indo- Pak war The Indo-Soviet treaty had provided India with cover against any possible Chinese intervention in aid of Pakistan if and when the conflict precipitated. To the Pakistani leadership, it became clear that armed Indian intervention and secession of East Pakistan was becoming inevitable. On 3 December, Pakistan launched Operation Chengiz Khan, marking the official initiation of hostilities of the Indo-Pak war of 1971. The Indian response was a defensive military strategy in the western theatre while a massive, coordinated and decisive offensive thrust into the Eastern theatre. On 5 December, United States began attempts for a UN-sponsored ceasefire, which were twice vetoed by the USSR in the security council. India extended her recognition of Bangladesh on 6 December. On 8 December, Washington received intelligence reports that India was planning an offensive into West Pakistan. It was in this situation that the United States dispatched a ten-ship naval task force, the US Task Force 74, from the Seventh Fleet off South Vietnam into the Bay of Bengal. =US diplomatic initiatives= With intelligence reports indicating the Indian cabinet was discussing the scopes of offensive into West Pakistan, on 10 December, the decision was taken by US to assemble a task force at Malacca strait, spearheaded by USS Enterprise. The force was to be capable of overshadowing the four Soviet ships already in the Bay of Bengal. =Deployment= The Task force was to be headed by USS Enterprise, at the time and still the largest aircraft carrier in the world. In addition, it consisted of amphibious assault carrier , carrying a 200 strong Marine battalion and twenty five assault helicopters; The three guided missile escorts , , and ; four gun destroyers , , and ; one ammo ship ;one auxiliary fleet supply ship from Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines , who loaded over 60 Tons of Mail and Christmas Packages for the Task Force before leaving Subic Bay to join Task Force 74 on 19 December and a nuclear attack submarine. The Enterprise was assigned by the Central authority, while the other ships were assigned by local commanders. Enterprise was at this time at the Tonkin Gulf area. Recovering her airborne aircraft and transferring personnel who were required to stay to the , she prepared to head off. The task force was delayed while the support ships refueled, it held off East of Singapore, and was ordered into the Indian Ocean on 14 December. crossed Malacca straits on the nights of 13–14 December and entered the Bay of Bengal on the morning of 15 December. The group was required to proceed slowly, averaging a speed of 15 knots, both to conserve fuel as well as to allow advance information on its heading. =Objectives= The US government announced at the time that the task force could help evacuate Pakistani forces from East Pakistan following a ceasefire. =Soviet involvement= On 6 and 13 December 1971, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok; they trailed US Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by USS Enterprise task force in the Indian Ocean.

The Spice Boys were six neophyte and two-term congressmen of the House of Representatives of the Philippines openly critical of the administration during Joseph Estrada's term as President of the Philippines. The group's name is an allusion to the British girl-group, the Spice Girls. They also played a key role in Estrada's removal from office. The Estrada administration's equivalent of this opposition clique was a seven-member group of congressmen Estrada christened as the \\"Bright Boys\\". Background The 1998 Philippine general election ushered in a wave of neophyte congressmen into the House of Representatives, filling 140 seats of the 220-seat Lower House. About a fifth of its members were under 40 years of age, roughly equivalent to Generation X. This influx of young blood changed the way legislative business was undertaken and the image of the Filipino politician, most of whom were derided as trapos or \\"TRAditional POliticians\\". Incidentally, the Spanish word trapo means \\"rag\\", as in rag doll or dish rag. After the Lakas-NUCD party was reduced to 25 members at the height of the Charter-change debate in 1999 and became the minority bloc in the House, six young congressmen became media sensations due to their fervent opposition to the issue of making changes to the Philippine Constitution. This group came to be dubbed by the media as the \\"Spice Boys\\", effectively becoming the face and voice of the opposition. As of 2001, the members of the group are no longer in the opposition and are holding positions in the Cabinet or Congress. Composition The group consisted of: # Rolando Andaya, Jr. – 1st District, Camarines Sur # Robert Ace Barbers – 2nd District, Surigao del Norte # Michael Defensor – 3rd District, Quezon City # Hernani Braganza – 1st District, Pangasinan # Federico Sandoval II – Navotas-Malabon # Juan Miguel Zubiri – 3rd District, Bukidnon Post EDSA II After the EDSA Revolution of 2001, the Spice Boys were assigned key positions in the Arroyo administration. In 2003, the Spice Boys pledged their support for Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's 2004 Presidential campaign. In 2004, three were given committee chairmanships in the House of Representatives. Andaya became chairman of the appropriations committee; Barbers headed the accounts committee, and Zubiri, the committee on legislative franchises. Defensor became head of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, while Braganza took over as agrarian reform secretary.

Stockholm during the early Vasa era (1523-1611) is a period in the history of Stockholm when Gustav Vasa and his sons, Eric, John, John's son Sigismund, and finally Gustav's youngest son Charles, ruled Sweden from the Stockholm Palace.  City of the state  On the day he entered Stockholm, Gustav Vasa guaranteed citizens who wished to stay in the city protection of their lives and property, and, for those who preferred to leave, the right to bring personal property with them if real property was turned over to the king. The king finally restored the privileges of the city in 1529. They were mostly identical to the privileges the city had in 1436 and proved beneficiary to the burghers of the city, giving them a monopoly on several important trades. To maintain his control over the city, the king, just like King Christian before him, acted by means of directly controlling the elections of aldermen and magistrates. Initially, Vasa's influence over these appointments seem to have been somewhat balanced by the laws of the rural districts (concerning the appointment of the judges in the hundreds, häradshövdingar) which stipulated the king should choose the most suitable leader among three proposed candidates. During most of his rule, however, his strong position made any such limitations in his influence unlikely, and the delimitation between the jurisdiction of the state and that of the city in which it resided, must have been vague. By the mid-century, the number of city officials increased from 12 and up to 19, not only in order to make management more professional, but also because the state wanted more control over trade, demands that burdened the still volunteered members of the city council, most of whom were merchants (only three prominent craftsmen are mentioned 1545–1559). The city thus lost much of the independence it had during the Middle Ages and became politically and financially bound to the state.Nilsson, pp. 64–66 The death of Gustav Vasa hardly caused any changes in local government. During the reign of his sons (1561–1611) the city council remained escorted by a royal representative and both magistrates and aldermen were appointed by the king.Nilsson, pp. 80–82  Reformation  Image from Triumph of Vasa, showing the king abandoning the Catholic Church. The city Vasa took charge over had changed dramatically: As the Bloodbath had killed many of the city's prominent citizens, the king, who had no wish to return to the old order, could appoint city magistrates as he wished and thus controlled the city. He could use the Storkyrkan church as a bastion and force churches and other religious institutions to hand over countless gold and silver objects, an income used to pay his war debt to Lübeck. Additionally, he invited the clergyman Olaus Petri (1493–1552) to become the city secretary of Stockholm. With the two side-by-side, the new ideas of the Protestant Reformation could be quickly implemented, and sermons in the church were held in Swedish starting in 1525 and Latin abolished in 1530. A consequence of this development was a need for separate churches for the numerous German and Finnish-speaking citizens and during the 1530s the still existent German and Finnish parishes were created. The king was, however, not favourably disposed to older chapels and churches in the city, and not only did he order churches and monasteries on the ridges surrounding the city to be demolished—according to himself because the citizens feared they would impair the defence of the city—but he also wanted to see the city church destroyed because of its location near the royal castle—plans however never carried through. The many charitable institutions run by these religious institutions were converged into a single one, Danviken Hospital, which most likely couldn't offer the social services of its predecessors. A disaster for the many disabled in the city, further deepened twenty-five years later when the hospital was relocated out of sight from the city.Nilsson, pp. 66–68  Fortifications  Northern city gate in 1535 as depicted in the Vädersolstavlan painting. In medieval times, the city walls were the responsibility of the city council, which used one-half to two-thirds of the tax collected for the construction and maintenance of the defensive structures. The city was, together with Kalmar which also had a city wall, in reward exempt from the tax paid by other Swedish cities. Gustav Vasa installing himself on the throne did not affect these responsibilities, but decisions on what structures to build where did. The extent to which the king controlled the city became apparent in the mid-1530s when he heavy-handedly stroke down on a German conspiracy and had all small arms in the city transferred from the town hall to the royal palace. He thus had the southern city gate, still damaged since Christian II's siege in 1520, rebuilt during the 1520s, and then had towers with flanking walls constructed along the western shore of Riddarholmen and by the northern gate, fortifications further reinforced during the following two decades. Due to land elevation the number of navigable approaches to the city through the Stockholm Archipelago had been reduced to one, and the defence of the eastern shore could therefore be relocated out of town to Vaxholm.Nilsson, pp. 68–70  Trade  Panoramic view showing the northern city gate with fortifications. Copperplate by Frantz Hogenberg around 1570-80 Cog Harbour\\") Copperplate by Frantz Hogenberg While the medieval structure of Stockholm remained mostly unaltered during the 16th century, the city's social and economic importance grew to the extent that no king could permit the city to determine its own faith. Export from the city by the end of the 1550s has been estimated to 600.000 marks, four to five times the export from any other Swedish city (such as Nya Lödöse and Söderköping). So, by controlling trade to and from Stockholm, the king effectively controlled national trade. The most important export items at this time was iron (56%), butter (11%), train oil (10%), and salmon (6%) (export of copper was prohibited during the later reign of Vasa). The most important destinations for these goods were Lübeck (60%) and Danzig (30%), with the remaining 10% shipped to Baltic cities, Stralsund and Rostock, Denmark, the Netherlands and France. While Lübeck apparently was an important trade partner, confrontations between the king and the German city caused export to be diverted to other destinations over periods, and in 1549–55 export to Lübeck was prohibited for Swedish citizens. Import of salt was important. Preserved records from the era fail to detail the amount of other goods delivered to the city from the rural areas surrounding it, including agricultural products produced in the Lake Mälaren region such as butter and fur.Nilsson, pp. 70–72 During the reign of Vasa's sons Stockholm was dominating every aspect of the country. While the city hardly produced anything exportable by itself, approximately two-thirds of national export was channelled through the city; an export dominated by iron and copper from Bergslagen but which also included agricultural items, such as butter and occasionally corn, and forestry products, such as pitch and tar. While this trade caused many Swedes to settle in the city, the trade and the capital needed to control it was largely in the hands of the king and German merchants from Lübeck and Danzig.  Hereditary bastion  John III. Image from the 19th century showing the courtyard of the Stockholm Castle. When Eric XIV, the son of Gustav Vasa, was crowned king in 1561, the title had been made hereditary and the kingdom was now financed not by income from royal properties and privileges, but by taxes. Furthermore, at this time the extent of the kingdom, because of the guarded foreign politics of Gustav Vasa largely unchanged during his rule, started to grow as the disintegrating Teutonic Order left the Baltic exposed to new ambitious powers, and Reval, as a consequence, asked for Swedish protection against Russia and Poland and became a Swedish dominion. Though Sweden could hardly present the level of government and bureaucracy prerequisite to have a capital in the modern sense, Stockholm was the kingdom's strongest bastion and the king's main residence. As Eric XIV's pretensions were in pair with those of Renaissance princes on the continent, he afforded himself a court the size his finance could possibly support, and the royal castle was thus the biggest employer in the city, more so when the king was present in person. In connection to his crowning in 1561, his taste for luxury caused the Crown to consume between two-thirds and three- quarters of the city's import.  Population  Map of Stockholm in 1547 Around 1560-80, most of the citizens, some 8.000 people, still lived on Stadsholmen. This central island was at this time densely settled and the city was now expanding on the surrounding ridges. Wooden buildings were prohibited on the island, but as this regulation was announced at countless occasions it was apparently often ignored. By the early 1580s two-thirds of the 731 residential buildings on the island were built in stone, and of these about four-fifths were small one-family residences − narrow buildings two or three stories tall. There were no private palaces at this time and the only larger buildings were the castle, the church, and the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen. This urbanity could hardly have made a lasting impression on any visitor, but the structures on the surrounding ridges failed to meet even these standards as Gustav Vasa, who, for defensive purposes, required any structures outside the city to be easily burnt down, had made sure the ridges couldn't even present a single timber framed building. So instead, the ridges were primarily used for activities that either required a lot of space, produced odours, or could cause fire. Even though some burgher had secondary residences outside the city, the population living on the ridges, perhaps a quarter of the city's population, were mostly poor, including the royal personnel occupying the northern ridges.

The community is named \\"Ramot Naftali\\" (hills of Naftali) because it is located in the mountains of Naftali, which was originally in the land owned by the Tribe of Naphtali. History The community was founded in 1945 by a group of agricultural workers called \\"Bnei Peled\\" who were sent by national agencies to guard the land and prepare it for agriculture. After the end of World War II arrived the first group of discharged soldiers from two groups, \\"Wingate\\" and \\"HaMitnadev\\", who organized for settlement before they had joined the army. The community was built around the fortress of Ramot Naftali, which was established together with the fortresses Birya and Hukok in 1945 as part of the defense of the British army in northern Israel, and in collaboration with the Jewish Agency. The fortresses were built by the construction company Solel Boneh. The fortress today is part of a nearby army base, and it is used for guard-watching.

Only after Operation Hiram did the attacks in the region cease. After the war, Ramot Naftali took over part of the land belonging to the newly depopulated Palestinian villages of Qadas and Al-Nabi Yusha'. In August 1963 a new nucleus of founders went to Kedesh Naftali, after the dispersal of the original members of the moshav. In the community two families remained from the first founding nucleus: Eliezer and Batya Kaufman and their three children, and the Adler family. Along with seven founders were: Ra'anan Naim, Rafael Albo, Yitzhak Sabag, Freddy Preinteh, Hananya Dadush, Zevulun Kohen and Ilan Zarka. The nucleus was composed mostly of young couples from moshavim, who had left Morocco, Tunisia and Libya. The initiative was successful, and many people joined together with the founding nucleus: Yuval Hermoni, Zevulun Kohen, the brothers Moshe and Hayyim Alon, Meir Halb, and some single men such as David Avitan, and many others. The settlers lived first in abandoned houses of the first nucleus atop the mountain, but within three years new houses were built at the foot of the mountain, which eventually were expanded. Economy The moshav is known for growing apples, peaches and grapes. The grapes of Ramot Naftali are considered excellent by experts, and they are sold to the finest wineries in the land. The moshav has some boutique wineries, including Amram Winery of the vintner Amram Azulai. Some members of the moshav make their living by tourism or growing fowl. People The people of Ramot Naftali are known for their contributions to the Paratroopers Brigade and to elite army units. Eitan Blahsan, a commander of Sayeret Tzanhanim, was born in Ramot Naftali, and was killed in a battle in Lebanon. Army members had high hopes for him and thought he might someday rise to Chief of Staff (Ramatkal). Mitzpe Eitan was erected as a memorial near the moshav, overlooking the Lebanon mountains and his parents' house. Nearby places Near Ramot Naftali are the following communities: kibbutz Malkia, Kibbutz Yiftah, and moshav Dishon. The community is located next to Metzudat Koach, a compound of the British Mandate, where 28 fighters were killed when it was captured during the War of Independence.

The cinema, which opened in 1912, was built for the Bo'ness cinematography pioneer Louis Dickson and designed by renowned local architect Matthew Steele. It is designated as a Category A listed building. History The name and the circular form of the building that Steele produced for Dickson might suggest that it was originally designed as a circus or theatre venue for travelling shows, but the earliest known plans, dated October 1911, show no evidence of this. They do, however, show a dedicated Operators box for a projector and are labelled 'Proposed Picture Palace, Hope Street'. Constructed on a corner site, the Hippodrome consists of a circular auditorium with wrap-around gallery facing a proscenium and small stage. What little ancillary space was wrapped around this filled in the corners of the site. The October 1911 plans show that at this stage the lavatories were 'to be built later'. The flat roof was supported on three girders, running parallel to the screen. In 1926, the cinema underwent various transformations by the original architect, including adding a domed roof and ticket office. The last film shown was in August 1975, after which it was turned into a bingo hall until its closure in 1980. Thereafter, it was left abandoned and at the mercy of vandals. The building was listed Category B by Historic Scotland in 1979, and upgraded to Category A in 2004. Present Bo'ness Hippodrome interior In 2002 Scottish Historic Buildings Trust (SHBT) invited three companies to respond to their brief to find a use for the former Hippodrome Cinema. The agreement made provision for the refurbished building to be transferred or leased to the creators of the preferred scheme on favourable terms in return for their speculative consultancy work. Reinstating the cinema back to its former use and the creation of a community space was proposed by IDEAS, the Falkirk-based design firm. Although at the time the preferred option was for the building to be used as a Gym, SHBT requested that they retain an option on the IDEAS proposals. Later, Falkirk Council initiated an HLF Townscape Heritage Initiative for Bo'ness. A sustainable use for the Hippodrome was considered critical, indeed pivotal to the release of grant funding, the IDEAS proposal was revived and considered worthy. Following grants from various organisations amounting to £1.8million, the cinema underwent renovation from the middle of 2006. The restoration work saved original features, including: cast iron radiators, oak panelling in the foyer area and art deco signs for toilets. The work was largely completed on 14 February 2008 when the keys were handed over to its new owner, Falkirk Council. The renovation then went through a final phase when modern cinema projection and sound equipment were added. On 9 April 2009, the cinema finally opened its doors again to the public - a reminder of the golden age of cinema. On 1 July 2011, Falkirk Community Trust assumed responsibility for the management and operation of the Bo'ness Hippodrome. In 2014, VisitScotland gave the venue a four star rating, indicating \\"an excellent standard\\".

He bought the Ashio copper mine from the Japanese government in 1877, which he later organized, with his other holdings, into an industrial conglomerate called the Furukawa zaibatsu, one of the most important in Japan. Japanese companies today with the names \\"Furukawa\\" and \\"Fuji\\", often belong to this group. Biography Furukawa's school education began and ended before Commodore Perry's ships entered Japanese waters. His parents were lower middle-class and could not afford to give him a higher education. It was about the time of the treaty that opened Japan to commerce with the United States and other civilized nations, that the strong traits manifested by the boy attracted the attention of a business man in his native town. He was adopted by an eccentric man named Furukawa Tarozaemon, who gave his adopted son some schooling in business. The stepfather and son had frequent but respectful differences of opinion, but in time the father realized that Furukawa was usually right and in time gave him free rein - a Japanese instance of fortiter in re, suaviter in modo.Gateway Vol.1, No.3, p.5 (Oct. 1903) =Commerce and foreign trade= Furukawa made large profits in the raw silk trade, exporting his stock for foreign consumption. He also did well in the rice trade, while suffering severe losses at times - an early example of the vicissitudes of commodities trading. =Industry= In spite of his successes in commerce, Furukawa felt the need to be directly involved with the working man. He yearned to be a captain of industry, desirous of expanding employment opportunities for his compatriots, as unemployment was a serious problem in Japan. He had aspirations similar to a few pioneering industrialists in the West who wished to improve the lot of the working man and to expand the demand for his services. He also had benevolent ideas on raising the standard of living for the working classes, espousing methods of making provision for old age, and suitable foundations to help toward that end. The opportunity to fulfill his dream came about as the result of the failure of a Japanese firm, which has considerable consequence in the business of the empire. Furukawa had reflected upon the opportunities in mining. He bought out a failing copper mine and as he found mining to his liking, he bought another after a while. This second mine was old and had been worked for decades. It had always produced fairly, but was thought to be pretty well spent. Furukawa's purchase was laughed at by a few of the initiated and not even his own miners encouraged him in the venture. As operations in the mine improved under his ownership and management, it turned out to be one of the greatest mines of Japan, the now-famous Ashio Copper Mine.  Copper  At greater depths, he found huge deposits of ore and production increased immensely. He used the great wealth he accumulated to establish his ideal industrial city in the mountains of Ashio. He built better homes for the miners, he installed schools for the young, he endowed hospitals, he built roads throughout the district, he provided instructive amusements for the working men, which was an unheard of thing in Japan at the time. He lived among the miners so far as the outside demands of his business would permit; when away from them he was nothing more than a plain citizen of Tokyo. All the while he was extending his operations. He bought ten more mines of coal and of copper, in different districts of Japan. All of them prospered, and with their prosperity came a better share of the better things of life for the miners, and a great extension of fields of employment. So huge was his wealth and influence that superstitious people began to believe that he might be a demon and that all his beneficence was simply a ploy to gain control over them. This was especially so among neighbouring communities who did not benefit directly from the wealth of the mines, in spite of the fact that the wealth of the whole region and nation benefited from it. When the enormous pollution from the mines began to affect the health of the inhabitants of the region, they felt that their suspicions were confirmed. After riots ensued, the government stepped in and demanded a remedy. In response, Furukawa built a system of tunnels and canals to carry the industrial waste to a remote coast. The cost was great, but the work was completed under his own supervision in a short time. It was a triumph for the government and the people took it as an evidence that even the devil himself was no match for the imperial power of the Emperor. =Later life= Although Furukawa might be seen as patriarchal in his ideas, and his scheme of government as monarchal, his influence remains, and he is remembered in Japan as the highest example of a far-sighted, public-spirited man, who accomplished great things, and deserved his title of the \\"Copper King.\\" In his seventy- second year, the year prior to his death, he went to Korea to open a gold mine. He also had in mind great plans to open mines in China, cut short by his death. His great wealth and ripe old age, did not cause him to slow down. He refused to listen to the remonstrances of his friends and relatives, and remained busy, and with his usual amazing success, until the end. He first introduced machinery in the sericulture of Japan, thereby extending the production of silk. He preceded all others in the use of electric lights and power in his coal mines and he established the first coke ovens in Japan. He eagerly adopted all modern improvements, and was a good customer for American inventors and manufacturers.

Agios Germanos is located at an altitude of approximately 1,100 meters (3,606 feet), on a hillside, part of the Varnoundas Mountains. It is from the Prespes lakes, which can be seen from a panorama location of the village. Agios Germanos lies from Florina, and from Kastoria. Name Until 1926, the village was known as German (). Pandektis: Name Changes of Settlements in Greece, compiled by the Institute for Neohellenic Research In the Macedonian language, it is known as Герман, German and the name of the settlement comes from the old village church Sveti German (Saint Germanus). The modern Greek name Agios Germanos means \\"Saint Germanus\\". Features The village is the only village in the Prespes region that has preserved all of the old stone houses. The Byzantine church that forms the nucleus of the present village dates to the beginning of the 11th century. It has very interesting frescos painted in three different phases. Nearby, the church of Agios Athanasios was built at the end of the 18th century. The village is especially known among tourists for hiking, bird watching and the Agios Germanos river with falls, which has the endangered species of the Salmo trutta peristericus trout. Agios Germanos river is on the northeast of the village. One can also see the restored water mills along the river. Following the paths, one can reach the impressive mixed fir-beech forests, and the summits of Kitsevo or Despotiko (2,177m). The Sarakatsani, nomadic shepherds from Thessaly, have the tradition of bringing their herds to graze on these mountains every year from May to October. Just north of the village is an early 20th-century church built by Steven Doinidis. This church is kept up by the villagers, who number just over 200 as of 2008.

It was a regional stock car racing series, a Northern counterpart to the Southern stock car series of the day, Bill France's NASCAR. The first MARC race was at Dayton Speedway, in Dayton Ohio, on May 10, 1953. The series race slightly modified street cars. John Marcum, Blair Rattliff and Tom Cushman would be parts owner of Dayton Speedway in 1958. The series was renamed \\"Automobile Racing Club of America\\" (ARCA) in 1964 when it began to race on superspeedways. France had contacted Marcum wondering if ARCA would want a race at the Daytona Speedweeks. Marcum jumped at the chance for national exposure. The ARCA/NASCAR relationship continues today. The series frequently schedule events at the same track on the same weekend. The ARCA event is frequently the Saturday support race to the Sunday NASCAR Cup event. For several decades, ARCA used older NASCAR Cup racecars at their events. Today ARCA's President is the late John Marcum's grandson Ron Drager. John's wife, Mildred Marcum, was an integral part of the organization and worked both in the ARCA office on a regular basis until her death at 98 in 2012.* References External links Obituary 1913 births 1981 deaths NASCAR people NASCAR team owners Sportspeople from Toledo, Ohio Racing drivers from Ohio ","title":"John Marcum"},{"id":"16018609","text":"UltraBac Software, Inc. is a private corporation that is a global provider of backup and disaster recovery software.

Background The 1998 Philippine general election ushered in a wave of neophyte congressmen into the House of Representatives, filling 140 seats of the 220-seat Lower House. About a fifth of its members were under 40 years of age, roughly equivalent to Generation X. This influx of young blood changed the way legislative business was undertaken and the image of the Filipino politician, most of whom were derided as trapos or \\"TRAditional POliticians\\". Incidentally, the Spanish word trapo means \\"rag\\", as in a dish rag. The name \\"Bright Boys\\" was coined by Estrada during a social call on the then-President by the group. Rodolfo Albano III, the group's elder, commented that the six other young congressmen he was with were a smart clique. This led to Estrada calling them the \\"Bright Boys\\", as he thought they had a bright future in congress. It was also an allusion to a similar clique in the opposition, the Spice Boys. Composition The group consisted of: # Rodolfo Albano III - Isabela # Alan Peter Cayetano - Pateros-Taguig # Joseph Ace Durano - Cebu # Francis Escudero - Sorsogon # Edmundo Reyes, Jr. - Marinduque # Jurdin Jesus Romualdo - Camiguin # Gilberto Teodoro, Jr. - Tarlac See also * 11th Congress of the Philippines References Political party factions in the Philippines Presidency of Joseph Estrada ","title":"Bright Boys"},{"id":"16018653","text":"Ron Poe (born 1942) is a former American football coach.

In large part due to this opinion, India is one of the few common law jurisdiction which has rejected the doctrine of aboriginal title.Freeman v. Fairie (1828) 1 Moo. IA 305.Vaje Singji Jorava Ssingji v Secretary of State for India (1924) L.R. 51 I.A. 357.Virendra Singh & Ors v. The State of Uttar Pradesh [1954] INSC 55.Vinod Kumar Shantilal Gosalia v.

Origin Solicitor General Yorke The opinion was issued in response to a petition from the British East India Company. The company had previously been involved in land disputes with regular army officers--both over land acquired by purchase and land acquired by conquest.Bowen, 2002, p. 53. The opinion was reported on 24 December 1757.Bowen, 2002, p. 54. Text The opinion began with the least controversial portion: that territory seized by plunder was validly held by the company. If, in the course of the company's trade, the company acquired land by a defensive action, without the assistance of the regular army, it alone held title to those lands. The opinion went on to distinguish lands acquired by conquest from those acquired by treaty or negotiation. In the former case, the Crown would acquire both sovereignty and title; in the latter case, the Crown would acquire sovereignty, but the company would acquire title. Pratt and Yorke explained that, in India, a land grant issued by the Crown was not a prerequisite for land titles to be valid. The opinion condoned direct purchases \\"from the Mogul or any of the Indian Princes, or governments.\\" =Chalmers' version= The following text of the opinion is given by George Chalmers in his 1814 text, Opinions of Eminent Lawyers:Chalmers, 1815, pp. 194--95. > III. How far the king's subjects, who emigrate, carry with them the law of > England: First, The common law; Second, The statute law. > First. As to the common law. > (1.)

Pratt. > C. Yorke. Effect in North America U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall concluded that the opinion did not apply to North America. Land speculators in North America, opposed to the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited private purchases of land from Native Americans, circulated modified versions of the Pratt–Yorke opinion.Banner, 2005, pp. 102--03.Sosin, 1965, pp. 229--35, 259--67.Gipson, 1936, pp. 487-88. Mis-transcribed versions of the opinion appeared in North America circa 1757 or 1773. These versions omitted all reference to the East India Company or the Mogul, instead referring simply to \\"Indian Princes or Governments.\\" One reproduction of this version of the opinion can be found in the flyleaf of George Washington's 1783 diary. Land speculator William Murray unsuccessfully attempted to persuade a British military commander to allow him to begin negotiations with Indians based on another copy. Chief Justice John Marshall (citing to such a mis-transcribed version) considered the relevance of the Pratt–Yorke opinion to the status of aboriginal title in the United States in Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823): > The opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor General, Pratt and Yorke, have > been adduced to prove, that, in the opinion of those great law officers, the > Indian grant could convey a title to the soil without a patent emanating > from the crown. The opinion of those persons would certainly be of great > authority on such a question, and we were not a little surprised, when it > was read, at the doctrine it seemed to advance. An opinion so contrary to > the whole practice of the crown, and to the uniform opinions given on all > other occasions by its great law officers, ought to be very explicit, and > accompanied by the circumstances under which it was given, and to which it > was applied, before we can be assured that it is properly understood. In a > pamphlet, written for the purpose of asserting the Indian title, styled > 'Plain Facts,' the same opinion is quoted, and is said to relate to > purchases made in the East Indies. It is, of course, entirely inapplicable > to purchases made in America. Chalmers, in whose collection this opinion is > found, does not say to whom it applies; but there is reason to believe, that > the author of Plain Facts is, in this respect, correct.

In G. gracilis many flowers of a dense inflorescence are open at one time, and the petals (claw and limb) are 8–14 mm long and 4–8 mm wide; in G. brasiliensis only 2 or 3 small flowers are open at one time on a sparse inflorescence, and the petals are only 4–5 mm long and ca. 3 mm wide. Pollens are spherical, approximately 16-18 microns in diameter.

It is the head town of the Tres de Febrero Partido which forms part of the Greater Buenos Aires urban conurbation. In 1852 the area was the site of an important battle in Argentine history, the Battle of Caseros.  Toponymy  Caseros is the deformation (by locals) of the surname of Diego Casero, who bought land there in 1781.  History  The lands that now belong to the towns of El Palomar and Caseros, Buenos Aires were given by Juan de Garay to Captain Juan Ruiz in the second foundation of Buenos Aires Province on 1580, thus the locals called the place Cañada de Ruiz. There were two camps 1.600 yards wide; [by a league background starting in Río de las Conchas, now Reconquista River]. With the passage of time, and successive sales, had become the property of Isidro Burgos who in 1781 were sold to Diego Casero. The name of Diego Casero over time was distorted by locals and land called by the name of Caseros. In 1788 Casero built an edifice for breeding pigeons in what is now the town of El Palomar and whose name it took many years later the local railroad station. In 1850 acquires lands of Caseros, Manuel Ceferino Lynch Roo, who was married to Ana Espinoza de los Monteros Banfi, daughter of a colonel of the royal armies, 8 years later the widower marries his sister also widow Ignacia Espinosa de los Monteros Banfi.

In the section between Palermo in Buenos Aires city and Pilar in the Northern Zone, there were only two intermediate stations: Caseros and Muñiz. With the inauguration of the railroad, constructed the first 70 blocks surrounding the Caseros station, delimited by the streets: Lisandro de la Torre, Bonifacini, General Hornos and the Bartolomé Mitre Avenue, thus beginning the consolidation of the first housing nuclei, that would, years later, head town of the Tres de Febrero Partido. The Rural Tramway after the death of Federico Lacroze (1899) continued later under the command of his son Teófilo Lacroze. This line in 1891 stop being of blood drive and incorporates the steam locomotive, because of this, renamed Ferrocarril Rural de la Provincia de Buenos Aires. Is also enabled then Caseros station, renamed to Martín Coronado station. The official date of foundation of Caseros was on 21 February 1892.

Jerzy Lenczowski; February 2, 1915 - February 19, 2000) was a lawyer, diplomat, scholar, and Professor of Political Science, Emeritus, at the University of California, Berkeley. Lenczowski was a pioneer in his field as the founder and first chair of the Committee (later Center) of Middle Eastern Studies at Berkeley. He was among America's first major scholars of the modern Middle East. Lenczowski's book, American Presidents and the Middle East, along with The Other Arab-Israeli Conflict by Steven L. Spiegel and Peace Process by William B. Quandt, are considered by historian and former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, as being \\"three of the genre's finer examples\\", focusing on the post-World War II period and seeking to investigate broader aspects of America's Middle East history.Michael Oren, Power, Faith and Fantasy, 2007, Introduction, p.11 Lenczowski was the father of John Lenczowski, president and founder of the Institute of World Politics. Early life George Lenczowski was born as Jerzy Lenczowski of Polish parentage, in St. Petersburg, Russia (then known as Petrograd), on February 2, 1915, at a time when the land of his ancestors was still part of neighboring empires. His father worked as an engineer until the Russian Revolution. One of Lenczowski's earliest memories was a perilous escape from the Bolsheviks through war-torn Russia, which brought the Lenczowski family back to what soon would become an independent Poland, following World War I. It was there that Lenczowski received his education from primary school to the faculty of law from the University of Warsaw. He took his LL.M degree in 1936 and continued his studies in France, where he earned a Certificate in Civil Law at the University of Paris (1936) and a Doctorate in Juridical Science in Lille (1937). His dissertation on Contracts in Private and International Law was written in French and published in Paris by Domat-Montchrestien in 1938. A young man Following graduation, Lenczowski entered the Polish Foreign Service as a junior diplomat, and was stationed in the British Mandate of Palestine, acting as consular officer and liaison between the British authorities and Jewish immigrants from Poland. He was witness to the growing numbers of Jews desperate to escape Eastern Europe. \\"He was involved in what was a very difficult and delicate process,\\" said Lenczowski's son, \\"The British were trying to control the immigration and the Arabs didn't want the immigration.\\" When Poland was invaded and occupied by Germany and later by the Soviet Union in 1939, Lenczowski's Palestine assignment came to an end. In 1940 he volunteered to serve in the Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade which had moved out from Vichy controlled French Syria to Palestine. He saw action in Egypt and Libya, but most prominently at the siege of Tobruk, and advanced to the rank of second lieutenant. At the end of 1941, however, he was recalled by the Polish Foreign Service to be stationed, as press attaché, at the Polish Embassy in Tehran, Iran. There he was part of the effort to receive, process and assist some two million Poles, who had just been released from Soviet concentration camps upon the intervention of Britain. It was there that he met his future wife, Bronia, who herself had been a prisoner of the Soviets; they were wed in March 1943. He was also in Tehran during the 1943 Tehran Conference involving Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Tragedy struck at this time also, when his parents were arrested by the Germans during the Warsaw uprising and executed in a concentration camp. To America When the Yalta accord was signed in 1945, the Lenczowskis refused to serve in Stalin's communist government in Poland and sought refuge in the United States. After a year of graduate study at Johns Hopkins University, and occasional work for the Foreign Broadcasting Division of the Department of State, Lenczowski found employment as instructor, and later assistant professor, at Hamilton College in New York State. It was here that he came to the attention of Peter Odegard, one of the pivotal figures of the discipline of political science of the time and chair of the Berkeley department. He became a U.S. citizen in 1951. At Berkeley Upon Odegard's invitation, Lenczowski came to Berkeley in 1952 as a visiting associate professor; after another year of research and language study in Lebanon, he became a tenured member of the faculty. Lenczowski made his scholarly debut in the United States by publishing Russia and the West in Iran (1949). He soon followed this with his path-breaking work, The Middle East in World Affairs (1952). This book was republished, with appropriate revisions, in three later editions and has remained an authoritative text on the politics of the region for over three decades. The fourth edition was reviewed by John C. Campbell in Foreign Affairs in 1980 and states, in part; \\"This new edition of a well-known survey is worth noting for the extensive additional material covering 18 years of kaleidoscopic events, and because it remains remarkably comprehensive and reliable both as an introduction to the region and as a reference work.\\"Foreign Affairs - Book Review - The Middle East in World Affairs (4th Ed.) - George Lenczowski In Berkeley, Lenczowski was the founder and first chair of the Committee (later Center) of Middle Eastern Studies. Over the years, he served as vice chair and was among the nation's first major scholars of the modern Middle East. As an undergraduate teacher he was respected for his precision and openness; as graduate advisor of his department and mentor of graduate students he raised a generation of scholars who, in tribute, published the volume, Ideology and Power in the Middle East: Essays in Honor of George Lenczowski (1988). David P. Gardner, then University of California president, spoke in the book's foreword of Lenczowski's \\"contributions to a better understanding of the Middle East, and particularly a better understanding of its international relations, its revolutions, and the crucial role of oil.\\"03.08.00 - Obituaries Between 1949 and his death, Lenczowski authored six books and monographs, co-authored and co-edited two others, and published nearly 100 scholarly articles on Middle Eastern politics. Lenczowski retired from Berkeley in 1985. His last book, American Presidents and the Middle East, was released in 1990. Beyond Berkeley George Lenczowski's scholarship is characterized by the accumulation of massive amounts of data, most of which he collected from personal encounters and field trips. He was aided by his fluency in Polish, English, French, German, Russian, Arabic, and Persian. He was a master interviewer and was able to develop unusual rapport with his subjects. \\"He knew mid-Eastern heads of state, he knew everyone,\\" said Laurence Michalak, vice chairman of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Berkeley, \\"He was friendly with the royalty of Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. He was a big, tall man with a Polish accent. He had a very courtly manner. He was very, very polished and very well liked.\\" His reputation for objectivity made him welcome everywhere and earned him the respect of U.S. administrations of both political parties. He was a frequent visitor to the White House under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Lenczowski was invited to serve on the governing boards of numerous learned societies and centers of research. He spoke or lectured at St Antony's College, Oxford, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the universities of Geneva, Tehran, and Toronto, the American University of Beirut, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), the National War College (Washington, D.C.), the Army War College (Pennsylvania), and Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Lenczowski's humanism inspired in him a love of the law, a belief in social justice, and hope for world peace.

Zdeněk Nejedlý (February 10, 1878 in Litomyšl, Bohemia – March 9, 1962 in Prague) was a Czech musicologist, music critic, author, and politician whose ideas dominated the cultural life of what is now the Czech Republic for most of the twentieth century. Although he started out merely reviewing operas in Prague newspapers in 1901, by the interwar period his status had risen, guided primarily by socialist political views. This combination of left wing politics and cultural leadership made him a central figure in the early years of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic after 1948, where he became the first Minister of Culture and Education. In this position he was responsible for creating a statewide education curriculum, and was associated with the early 1950s expulsion of university professors.Brian S.

His formal education in music began with Josef Šťastný at the Litomyšl Gymnasium (1888–1896), alongside instruction in Czech history.Československý hudební slovník, vol. 2 (Prague: Statní hudební vydavatelství, 1965) In 1896 he moved to Prague to study at Charles University, where he attended lectures in positivist history with Jaroslav Goll and music aesthetics with Otakar Hostinský, finally receiving his doctorate in 1900. Hostinský, a great proponent of Smetana's music, suggested that Nejedlý study composition and music theory with his like-minded colleague, Zdeněk Fibich, whose personality and tastes had a profound effect on his young student. Although his first publications were devoted to Czech history, after Fibich's death in 1900 Nejedlý devoted himself to musicology, authoring a monograph entitled Zdenko Fibich, Founder of the Scenic Melodrama in 1901 as a first attempt at gaining greater recognition for his mentor. That these efforts were directed against the musical establishment of Prague (who he felt had victimized Smetana, Fibich, and Hostinský) was made clear by his first foray into music criticism that same year, in an attack on Antonín Dvořák's opera Rusalka shortly after its premiere. These factional divisions were to inspire Nejedlý throughout his whole career; in many ways he was personally responsible for perpetuating them for future generations, long after their currency in Czech musical society.Brian S. Locke, Opera and Ideology in Prague His 1903 History of Czech Music drew distinct battle lines between the Conservatory students of Dvořák and the supposed inheritors of Smetana, including the composers Josef Bohuslav Foerster, Otakar Ostrčil, and Otakar Zich, all personal friends of Nejedlý's on the outs with the Prague establishment. Over the next decade he produced an extraordinary amount of writing on music, including monographs on pre-Hussite song (1904, 1907, and 1913), Smetana's operas 1908, Czech Modern Opera Since Smetana (1911, notoriously excluding Dvořák), Hostinský (1907 and 1910), and Gustav Mahler (1913). In 1908 he began to lecture in musicology at Charles University, forming a circle of devoted young colleagues that included Zich and Vladimír Helfert. =Polemics and the Interwar Years= When Nejedlý's music reviews for Prague's daily newspapers grew distasteful in their anti-Conservatory bias, he and his followers were precipitously banned from publication, forcing the group to found their own journal, Smetana, which ran for sixteen years, 1910–1927. From this vantage point Nejedlý launched the so-called \\"Dvořák Affair\\" (1911–1914), in which he sought to attack the legacy of the great composer; any contemporary artists who sided against him (especially the 31 musicians who signed a public petition in 1912) became the focus of fierce personal attacks. Beginning with Vítězslav Novák in 1913, Nejedlý sought to end the careers of composers who did not conform to his pro-Smetana views of modern tradition and social responsibility: other notable targets included Josef Suk. Meanwhile, these tactics came back to haunt Nejedlý's own protégés, especially Ostrčil as director of Prague's National Theatre and Zich as a modernist opera composer. After the legalization of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1921, Nejedlý became one of its earliest and most outspoken members. With the exception of his Smetana journal, he turned away from mainstream journal publications, focusing on the Communist daily Rudé právo and his own political journal, Var (Boiling, 1921–30). In these he chastised the interwar Czechoslovak Republic, its president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, and various other leaders; the last issue of Var was taken up with a detailed defense of Alban Berg's opera Wozzeck, which Ostrčil had produced in 1926. By this point, however, his many musicology students were among the main critics in Prague, carrying on his work on his behalf. After the close of Var, his main involvements in music included a short polemic with Novák and monographs on Ostrčil (1935, to commemorate his friend's death), the National Theatre (1936), and Soviet music (1937). =Wartime and Postwar Communism= During the Nazi occupation of the Czech Lands, the Nejedlý family fled to the Soviet Union, where he supposedly helped Czech resistance activities from afar.Československý hudební slovník At this time, his son Vít Nejedlý (1912–45), whose short career in Prague had focused on Communist agitprop pieces and workers' choruses, was involved with a Czech brigade attached to the Red Army, whose band he attempted to emulate. After the end of the war (and Vít's death of typhus after the battle of Dukla, January 1945), Zdeněk Nejedlý returned to Prague to participate in the postwar government. Initially in Eduard Beneš's Third Republic he was made Minister of Education, Arts, and Sciences, but this was exchanged for Social Security by 1946. After the Communist seizure of power (the “February Revolution”) in 1948 he returned to Culture and Education with enhanced powers, a post he kept until 1953. These crucial years saw the implementation of a statewide curriculum at all levels of education: his revisionist stance toward Czech history was given the force of law. This included down-playing the achievements of the vanished democracy as a series of bourgeois trends that were ultimately damaging to society. It was also Nejedlý's chance to promote his passion for Smetana and his \\"lineage\\", now enacted as state law. To this latter end he entered a new stage of retrospective publishing, with works like The History of My Smetanism, On Czech Culture, and especially The Communists—Inheritors of the Grand Progressive Tradition of the Czech Nation. These works and especially their ideology were retained, in some form or another, in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic all the way until the fall of Communism (the “Velvet Revolution”) in 1989. As such, Nejedlý's name was associated with totalitarian hegemony by at least two generations of students, many of whom had no connection to his musicology. =The Show Trials and Josef Hutter= After approximately two years of Communist dictatorship, the Czechoslovak Communist Party began a purge of its own party or former non-communist opponents, most notoriously manifested in the arrest and execution of Rudolf Slánský and Milada Horáková. For Nejedlý, this atmosphere provided an opportunity to settle old scores in the academic and musical community. Over ten years before, in the mid-1930s, Nejedlý's public attacks against artists such as Leoš Janáček had turned many of his former adherents against him, most notably Vladimír Helfert, whose work as a musicologist had outstripped his teacher's, and Josef Hutter, who had published on Ostrčil and Zich. When Helfert published a landmark monograph, Czech Modern Music: A Study of Czech Musical Creativity (1936) that included a scathing attack on ideological bias in music criticism, Nejedlý expected his remaining followers to shun Helfert and condemn the publication. Hutter publicly sided with Helfert. During the Nazi occupation, both men were imprisoned by the Nazis: Helfert for Communist resistance (for which he was severely tortured, dying in May, 1945) and Hutter for pro-Democratic resistance. After the war, Hutter returned to Charles University, but was expelled in 1950 and arrested on trumped-up charges. He was sentenced to thirty-nine years imprisonment, but served only six, having been released during an amnesty. His health broken, Hutter died in 1959, three years before his former teacher. Zdeněk Nejedlý died on March 9, 1962, and was buried in the Vyšehrad cemetery at Prague's Vyšehrad castle, reserved for Czech heroes and significant representatives of Czech culture. His grave is near those of Smetana, Ostrčil, and his son, Vít. References Further reading *Červinka, František. Zdeněk Nejedlý [Cz.].

Life He entered the Society of Jesus at Pamplona in 1609. In the triennial reports of 1642 he says of himself that he was not physically strong, that he had studied religion, arts, and theology, that he had taught grammar one year, arts four, theology nineteen, and had been professed. According to Southwell, he taught philosophy at Monforte,There are several places in Spain called Monforte. The most likely candidate would seem to be Monforte de Lemos, home of the College of Nosa Señora da Antiga. theology at Salamanca, and was called from there to the Imperial College of Madrid, where, by royal decree, he taught moral theology. Later he was named censor to the Spanish Inquisition and confessor of Gaspar de Guzmán, Count- Duke of Olivares, the favorite of Philip IV of Spain, whom he followed when he was exiled from Madrid. Southwell describes his character by saying that he was a good religious, noted for his innocence. Mentally he qualifies him as subtle in argument, sound in opinion, keen-edged and clear in expression, and well-versed in Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. According to Paul Drews, no Jesuit ever occupied this chair in the University of Salamanca with more honor than he, and Hurter places him, with Lugo, first among the contemporary theologians of Spain, and perhaps of all Europe. Works Among the numerous theological opinions which characterize him the following are worth citing: #He thinks that the creation of an intrinsically supernatural substance is possible, in other words, that a creature is possible to which supernatural grace, with the accompanying gifts and intuitive vision, is due. #He holds that, by a positive decree of God, supernatural grace is conferred, in the existing providence for every good act whatsoever; so that every good act is supernatural, or at least that every natural good act is accompanied by another which is supernatural. #He maintains that, prescinding from the extrinsic Divine law, and taking into account only the nature of things, the supernatural faith which is called lata would be sufficient for justification, that faith, namely, which comes by the contemplation of created things, though assent is not produced without grace. #He affirms that in the promissory revelations the formal object of faith is God's faithfulness to His promises, the constancy of His will, and the efficacy of omnipotence. #He asserts that all the propositions of Baius were condemned for doctrine according to the sense in which he (Baius) held them. #He maintains that the Divine maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary is of itself a sanctifying form. The following are his works: *\\"De ente supernaturali disputationes in universam theologiam\\", .three vols., I (Bordeaux, 1634), II (Lyons, 1645), III, written \\"Adversus Bajanos\\" (Cologne, 1648); rare editions like that of Lyons, 1663, have been published of the two first volumes. It is a classic work in which he included questions which are not included in ordinary theological treatises. His third volume was attacked in an anonymous work, \\"P. Joannis Martínez ... Vulpes capta per theologos ... Academiae Lovaniensis\\", which Reusch says was the work of John Sinnich. \\"Expositio brevis litterae Magistri Sententiarum\\" (Salamanca, 1635), praised by the Calvinist Voet. *\\"Tractatus theologici et scholastici de virtutibus, fide, spe et charitate\\" (Lyons, 1652), a posthumous work and very rare.

Central forward area of the Mirage III cockpit, showing a centre stick. A centre stick (or center stick in the United States), or simply control stick is an aircraft cockpit arrangement where the control column (or joystick) is located in the center of the cockpit between the pilot's legs. Since the throttle controls are typically located to the left of the pilot, the right hand is used for the stick, although left-hand or both-hands operation is possible if required.Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, page 132. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. The centre stick is a part of an aircraft's flight control system, and is typically linked to its ailerons and elevators, or alternatively to its elevons, by control rods or control cables on basic aircraft. On heavier, faster, more advanced aircraft the centre stick may also control power-assist modules. Modern aircraft centre sticks are also usually equipped with a number of electrical control switches within easy finger reach, in order to reduce the pilot's workload. The centre stick is used in many military fighter jets such as Eurofighter Typhoon and the Mirage III, but also in light aircraft such as Piper Cubs and the Diamond Aircraft line of products such as the DA20, DA40 and DA42. This arrangement contrasts with the more recently developed \\"side-stick\\" which is used in such military fighter jets as the F-16, the F-35 Lightning II and Rafale and also on civil aircraft such as the Airbus A320.  History  The centre stick originated at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1900 Wilhelm Kress of Austria developed a control stick for aircraft, but did not apply for a patent. Instead, a patent was awarded to the French aviator, Robert Esnault-Pelterie who applied for it in 1907.Connections, Episode 6 Part 5 of 5 (1976).

The program, which emanated from Hollywood, California, premiered on September 16, 1985, and was initially hosted by Stuart Damon, Sarah Purcell, and McLean Stevenson with Charlie O'Donnell announcing. America was a production of Paramount Domestic Television, who also distributed the series. The program was recorded on the Paramount Pictures studio lot in Hollywood. Format Each show began with O'Donnell saying \\"good afternoon and welcome to America,\\" then giving the date and a rundown of the topics covered by the show in the sixty minutes to come. After that, the hosts were introduced and the show began. Feature stories included focuses on people, places, and trends, as well as an interview segment with a celebrity. Some stories were presented by reporters working for the affiliate stations; for example, the December 18, 1985, episode featured a story about a Little Rock, Arkansas, girl in need of a liver transplant that was presented by then-KATV reporter Greg Hurst.America, December 18, 1985, Paramount Television Ratings Paramount sold America to stations from various ownership groups. This included all five of CBS' owned and operated stations (WCBS-TV in New York, WCAU-TV in Philadelphia, WBBM-TV in Chicago, KMOX-TV in St. Louis, and KCBS-TV in Los Angeles), ABC O&O; KGO-TV in San Francisco, and stations belonging to Paramount's production partner for America, Post-Newsweek Stations, including their largest affiliate WDIV-TV in Detroit. Paramount's major selling point was the time slots they were trying to place America in; the company felt that the focus on lifestyle and human interest stories would serve as a perfect lead in for the stations' early news broadcasts.Broadcasting Magazine issue from January 14, 1985, pages 68 and 69. Despite Paramount's best efforts, America met with low ratings from the start. 1985 was a big year for syndicated programming as stations had many options to choose from to fill slots in their schedules. This led to an overabundance of choices and not enough places for them to go; new shows that were able to get slots like Paramount wanted for America often found themselves facing off against a popular talk show like The Phil Donahue Show, or perhaps another first run syndicated program like the popular game show Wheel of Fortune or courtroom shows like The People's Court that had been established as hits. As the season reached November, the ratings for America were not improving and stations were losing interest in carrying the low-rated talk show. Stuart Damon left the program at the end of the month. After thirteen weeks of episodes had aired, CBS decided they would no longer carry America on its five stations. Shortly after this decision, Paramount fired McLean Stevenson from his hosting duties (leaving Sarah Purcell as sole host for the final two weeks) and announced the program would be ending on January 3, 1986, after sixteen weeks and eighty shows. The final episode closed with Purcell thanking the viewers for their support, followed by a video montage of show staff set to \\"Glory Days\\" by Bruce Springsteen that served as the closing credits.

It became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929. History The Warwick and Birmingham Canal Company obtained an Act of Parliament in March 1793, which authorised the construction of a canal from the Digbeth Branch Canal of the Birmingham Canal Navigations to Warwick, where it would end at Saltisford Wharf. The plans showed three tunnels, at Shrewley, Rowington and Yardley, but as construction progressed, the last two became deep cuttings. This was not an option at Shrewley, as the route passed under the village. The plans also specified that the tunnel would be suitable for boats but not barges, implying that it would have been suitable for narrow boats, common on the Birmingham system, but not for wider craft. However, construction of the Grand Junction Canal, which would provide a link to London, was started at a similar time, and the committee wisely took the decision in April 1794 to increase the width of the tunnel to , allowing wide barges to pass through it. The width of the bridge holes was similarly increased to in May. Northern entrance to the canal and accompanying horse tunnel The tunnel is long, built of brick and is wide enough for two narrow boats to pass each other, although it has no towpath inside. It officially opened on 19 December 1799 when the rest of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal was completed, although no trading took place until the following March. It became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929 following the amalgamation of the canal company with several others, including the Grand Junction. There are actually two tunnels: at the northern portal, the towpath splits off and rises on a ramp and then enters a tunnel of its own, until it reaches the road which crosses the tunnel; having crossed this the path then descends on another ramp to reach the southern portal. The interior of the tunnel is unusually wet and this has led to the creation of flowstone formations. Location The tunnel runs from the south-east to the north-west. From the northern portal, the canal is level for to the bottom of a flight of five locks at Knowle, which raise the level of the canal by . Kingswood Junction, which connects to the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal occurs about halfway along this stretch.

Edward Elgar Publishing. p. 283 is the libertarian position that is supportive of a free market and strong private property rights only on the grounds that they bring about favorable consequences such as prosperity or efficiency.  Overview  What consequentialist libertarians advocate is derived through cost–benefit calculation, taking a broad account of consequences.Miron, Jeffrey A. (2010). Libertarianism: From A to Z. Basic Books. p. 39. It is contrasted with deontological libertarianism which considers the initiation of force and fraud to be immoral, regardless of consequences.Bradford, R. W. (2008). \\"The Two Libertarianisms\\". Liberty. Liberty Foundation. Unlike deontological libertarians, consequentialist libertarians do not necessarily see all cases of initiation of force as immoral and do not see it as inherently immoral (i.e. they do not express a belief in natural rights). Rather, their position is that political and economic liberty lead to the best consequences in the form of happiness and prosperity and for that reason alone it should be supported. Some libertarians may have a conception of libertarianism that is a hybrid of consequentialism and deontology. Unlike deontological libertarians, consequentialist libertarians advocate actions they believe bring about favorable consequences regardless of whether these constitute initiation of force.Murray, Charles; Friedman, David D.; Boaz, David; Bradford, R.

It was initially built at Zwickau at the plant previously owned by Auto Union. In 1953 production was transferred to the former BMW manufacturing plant at Eisenach where its underpinnings subsequently found their way into the Wartburg 311. Origins Mechanically the F9 derived from the DKW F8 which had been available between 1939 and 1942. The body closely followed the design of the DKW F9, a prototype with which Auto Union would have replaced the F8 on the Zwickau production lines earlier, had the war not intervened. After the war, the first car assembled at Zwickau was the prewar DKW F8, but the more modern F9 started to appear in 1949 or 1950 (sources differ). Materials shortages probably delayed introduction in both German states, but the eastern car beat the western to the market, and certainly featured the three-cylinder motor from the 1938 F9 prototype (rather than the two-cylinder motor that had been in serial production in 1942) at least three years before Auto Union in Düsseldorf were installing it in their F91. The bodies Surviving F9s appear largely restricted to saloon versions, but various sports and cabriolet versions were also produced. Steel for consumer industries was in short supply across many parts of Europe during this period, and the F9’s body construction increasingly involved plastic panels, especially after production was moved to Eisenach in 1953. The car was accordingly usefully lighter than its western built Auto Union equivalent. Technical The F9 featured a three-cylinder two-stroke water-cooled engine of 910 cc with a claimed output, at launch, of . The engine was water-cooled, the radiator being located behind the engine, an unusual configuration but one also found on the DKW F91. The front wheels were driven via a four-speed manual gear box with a free wheel. While the Zwickau plant was producing the IFA F9, in the west Auto Union launched the DKW F89 derived from the same prewar DKW F9 prototype. At this stage, however, the western car was still powered by a two-cylinder 684 cc engine.

It is also known as progressive diaphyseal dysplasia. It is a form of dysplasia. Patients typically have heavily thickened bones, especially along the shafts of the long bones (called diaphyseal dysplasia). The skull bones may be thickened so that the passages through the skull that carry nerves and blood vessels become narrowed, possibly leading to sensory deficits, blindness, or deafness. This disease often appears in childhood and is considered to be inherited, however many patients have no previous history of CED within their family. The disease is slowly progressive and, while there is no cure, there is treatment. It is named for M. Camurati and G. Engelmann. Signs and symptoms Patients with CED complain of chronic bone pain in the legs or arms, muscle weakness (myopathy) and experience a waddling gait. Other clinical problems associated with the disease include increased fatigue, weakness, muscle spasms, headache, difficulty gaining weight, and delay in puberty. Some patients have an abnormal or absent tibia, may present with a flat foot, or scoliosis. This disease may also cause bones to become abnormally hardened which is referred to as sclerosis. This hardening may affect the bones at the base of the skull or those in the hands, feet, or jaw. This causes ongoing pain and aching within the body parts that are affected. The pain has been described as either a hot electric stabbing pain, an ever-increasing pressure sensation around the bones (especially before electrical storms) or as a constant ache that radiates through several long bones at once. Pain may also occur in the hips, wrists, knees and other joints as they essentially just 'lock-up' (often becoming very stiff, immobile and sore), mostly when walking up or down staircases, writing for extended periods of time, or during the colder months of the year. Those with the disease tend to have a very characteristic walk medically diagnosed as a 'waddling gait'. This is observed by the broad-based gait with a duck-like waddle to the swing phase, the pelvis drops to the side of the leg being raised, notable forward curvature of the lumbar spine and a marked body swing.Whyte, M. P., Totty, W. G., Novack, D. V., Zhang, X., Wenkert, D., & Mumm, S. (2011). Camurati‐engelmann disease: Unique variant featuring a novel mutation in TGFβ1 encoding transforming growth factor beta 1 and a missense change in TNFSF11 encoding RANK ligand. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 26(5), 920-933. The pain is especially severe during a 'flare-up', these can be unpredictable, exhausting and last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks. This is a common occurrence for several CED patients, often causing myopathy and extensive sleep deprivation from the chronic, severe and disabling pain. Patients may even require the use of a wheelchair (or additional carer's help with getting dressed, showering, mobility/shopping, preparing meals or lifting heavy items) especially when bedridden or housebound for days or weeks at a time. 'Flare-ups' may be attributed to, or exacerbated by growth spurts, stress, exhaustion, exercise, standing or walking for too long, illness, infection, being accidentally knocked/hurt or injured, after surgery/anaesthetics, cold weather, electrical storms, and sudden changes in barometric pressure. CED may also affect internal organs, the liver and spleen, which may become enlarged. A loss of vision and/or hearing can occur if bones are adversely affected by the hardening in the skull. Hence proactive specialist check-ups, X-rays, diagnostic tests/scans, and regular blood tests are recommended on an annual basis to monitor the CED bony growth and secondary medical issues that may arise from this condition.Carlson, M. L., Beatty, C. W., Neff, B. A., Link, M. J., & Driscoll, C. L. (2010). Skull base manifestations of Camurati-Engelmann disease. Archives of Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery, 136(6), 566-575. Cause Camurati-Engelmann disease is caused by an error or mutation in the protein known as TGFB1, localized at chromosome 19q13. The exact cause of the mutation is unknown. Diagnosis =Classification= There are two forms: * Type 1 is associated with TGFB1 * Type 2 is not associated with TGFB1 Type 1 Camurati-Engelmann Disease is associated with an error occurring in the TGFB1 protein. Affected individuals shared a haplotype between D19S881 to D19S606.Ghadami, M., Makita, Y., Yoshida, K., Nishimura, G., Fukushima, Y., Wakui, K., ... & Tomita, H. A. (2000). Genetic mapping of the Camurati- Engelmann disease locus to chromosome 19q13. 1-q13. 3. The American Journal of Human Genetics, 66(1), 143-147. TGFB1 protein is encoded by the TGF-B1 gene, which occurs on chromosome 19q13.1-13.3.Janssens, K., Gershoni-Baruch, R., Van Hul, E., Brik, R., Guañabens, N., Migone, N., ... & Vanhoenacker, F. (2000). Localisation of the gene causing diaphyseal dysplasia Camurati-Engelmann to chromosome 19q13. Journal of medical genetics, 37(4), 245-249. This protein is responsible for a multitude of functions, one of which includes regulating the function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which decreases bone resorption and increases bone formation.Saito, T., Kinoshita, A., Yoshiura, K. I., Makita, Y., Wakui, K., Honke, K., ... & Taniguchi, N. (2001). Domain-specific mutations of a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 latency-associated peptide cause Camurati-Engelmann disease because of the formation of a constitutively active form of TGF-β1.Journal of Biological Chemistry, 276(15), 11469-11472. These functions can be affected by a series of mutations that occur on exon 4, near the carboxyl terminus of the latency associated peptide, or LAP.Kinoshita, A., Saito, T., Tomita, H. A., Makita, Y., Yoshida, K., Ghadami, M., ... & Fukushima, Y. (2000). Domain-specific mutations in TGFB1 result in Camurati-Engelmann disease. Nature genetics, 26(1), 19-20. TGFB1 is expressed as a latent form, a mature form and a B1-LAP. Mutations to R218H affect the association of the B1-LAP and the mature form of TGFB1 by conformational changes to B1-LAP. These mutations can lead to a buildup of mature TGFB1, which accumulates in the mutant R218H fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are a type of cell that creates collagen and the extracellular matrix. This suggests that R218H mutation causes a disassociation between mature-TGFB1 and B1-LAP. Mutations at the LLL12-13ins and Y81H regions decrease the secretion of TGFB1, which leads to intracellular buildup of TGFB1.Janssens, K., ten Dijke, P., Ralston, S. H., Bergmann, C., & Van Hul, W. (2003). Transforming growth factor-β1 mutations in Camurati-Engelmann disease lead to increased signaling by altering either activation or secretion of the mutant protein. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 278(9), 7718-7724. Type 2 Camurati-Engelmann Disease is still speculative, with no distinct evidence to credit its existence. There are many similarities between Type 2 CED and hyperostosis generalisata with striations of the bones (HGS), with some speculating they are two phenotypic variations of the same disease.Nishimura, G., Nishimura, H., Tanaka, Y., Makita, Y., Ikegawa, S., Ghadami, M., ... & Niikawa, N. (2002). Camurati‐Engelmann disease type II: Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia with striations of the bones. American Journal of Medical Genetics, 107(1), 5-11. Treatment Camurati–Engelmann disease is somewhat treatable. Glucocorticosteroids, which are anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, are used in some cases. This form of medication helps in bone strength, however can have multiple side effects. In several reports, successful treatment with glucocoricosteroids was described, as certain side effects can benefit a person with CED. This drug helps with pain and fatigue as well as some correction of radiographic abnormalities.Ayyavoo, A., Derraik, J. G., Cutfield, W. S., & Hofman, P. L. (2014). Elimination of pain and improvement of exercise capacity in Camurati-Engelmann disease with losartan. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 99(11), 3978-3982. Alternative treatments such as massage, relaxation techniques (meditation, essential oils, spa baths, music therapy, etc.), gentle stretching, and especially heat therapy have been successfully used to an extent in conjunction with pain medications. A majority of CED patients require some form of analgesics, muscle relaxant, and/or sleep inducing medication to manage the pain, specifically if experiencing frequent or severe 'flare-ups' (e.g. during winter).Jadhav, A.

Approximately 17 minutes in length, the film attempts to demonstrate that the Qur'an motivates its followers to hate all who violate Islamic teachings. The movie shows selected excerpts from Suras of the Qur'an, interspersed with media clips and newspaper cuttings showing or describing acts of violence and/or hatred by Muslims. The film argues that Islam encourages - among other things - acts of terrorism, antisemitism, violence against women, violence and subjugation of infidels and against homosexuals and Islamic universalism. A large part of the film details the influence of Islam on the Netherlands. The film was published on the Internet in 2008. Shortly before its release, its announcement was suspended from its website by the American provider because of the perceived controversy. It stirred a still continuing debate in the Netherlands as well as abroad. The Arabic title-word \\"fitna\\" means \\"disagreement and division among people\\" or a \\"test of faith in times of trial\\". Production The Friends of the Party for Freedom (PVV) foundation commissioned the film. It contracted a production company credited in the film as \\"Scarlet Pimpernel Productions\\", a pseudonym adopted out of fear of reprisal. In fact large parts of the documentary Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West written by Wayne Kopping and Raphael Shore were copied. Release The exact nature of Fitnas release was uncertain up until its official launch. This was due to concerns of the legality of its content and anticipated acts of terrorism. The Dutch press centre Nieuwspoort offered to release the film, on the condition that Wilders would pay for the increased security required during the press conference and the weeks after it. Wilders declined to do so, citing prohibitive costs Having failed to successfully negotiate a transmission of the film with any Dutch television station, Wilders created a website, www.fitnathemovie.com, on 5 March 2008 with the intention of releasing the film. However, this was subsequently suspended (see below). On 22 March, the Dutch Muslim Broadcasting Association (NMO) offered to air the film, on the proviso that it could be previewed for any possible illegal material and that Wilders would take part in a debate with proponents and opponents afterwards. Wilders declined, quoted as saying \\"No way, NMO.\\" Wilders released the film on 27 March 2008 on the video website LiveLeak. The following day, LiveLeak removed the film from their servers after receiving threats that they described as being \\"of a very serious nature\\". The film soon appeared on various BitTorrent and video sharing websites. LiveLeak reinstated Fitna on 30 March, after security upgrades offering increased protection to its staff had been implemented. Soon after, Wilders withdrew the film to make some minor edits, such as removing the copyrighted Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons Kurt Westergaard, the cartoonist, was pleased with the news and believed the lawsuit would be dropped. In September 2008, Wilders agreed to pay Westergaard 7500 euros for using his Jyllands-Posten cartoon without permission. A revised edition, containing a new cartoon in place of the contentious one, and a corrected picture of Bouyeri, was released on LiveLeak on 6 April. =Distribution= On 14 December 2008, a conference entitled \\"Facing Jihad\\" was organized at the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in Jerusalem. Geert Wilders, Arieh Eldad, Robert Spencer, Itamar Marcus, Daniel Pipes, Shlomo Sharan, and John David Lewis were in attendance. During the conference, Fitna was put on view and distributed to all conference attendees; it was announced that it would be shown in several European parliaments. The Ruder Finn PR company organized the conference and set up the group's website, and are also actively distributing the film. Finn distributed the film for free.  Plot  The film shows a selection of Suras from the Qur'an, interspersed with newspaper clippings and media clips with The Arabian Dance and Åses død as an underscore. =Themes= Wilders described the film as a push for a Leidcultuur, a culture that \\"draws on Christian, Jewish, humanistic traditions and that poses a challenge to the Islamic problem\\". The Qur'an and terrorism Al-Anfal 60 is shown next to a video of the attacks of September 11. The film starts with a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb on his head, shown next to a timer counting down from 15 minutes. Suras are juxtaposed to video clips of Imams stating Islamic teaching, and videos of violent atrocities committed in the name of Islam, including major terrorist attacks. The first Sura of the film, Al-Anfal verse 60, is translated as: Footage of the September 11 attacks is shown, followed by the Madrid train bombings. Imam Abu Hamza al-Masri rises above the smoke and declares \\"Allah is happy when non-muslims get killed.\\" Stills taken from the 7 July 2005 London bombings show an exploded bus and the underground train. The next Sura, An- Nisa verse 56, is shown as a justification for Islamic antisemitism. Sheikh Bakr Al-Samarai is shown raising a sword while declaring: \\"If Allah permits us, O nation of Mohammed, even the stone will say O Muslim. A Jew is hiding behind me, come and cut off his head. And we shall cut off his head! By Allah, we shall cut it off! O Jews! Allahu Akbar! Jihad for the sake of Allah!\\" An auditorium of several hundred people respond with approving chants and fist shaking. Following this, a three-year-old Muslim girl, says that Jews are \\"apes and pigs\\" because \\"Allah\\" said so \\"in the Qur'an\\" in an interview on Iqraa TV. Sura 47, verse 4 is shown in relation to the murder of Dutch film director Theo Van Gogh, committed by Mohammed Bouyeri. Bouyeri is reported as saying: \\"If I had the opportunity to get out of prison, and I had the opportunity to do it again, what I did on November 2nd, Allah I would have done exactly the same\\". Protesters are shown supporting Van Gogh's murder, warning others to heed the lesson or \\"pay with your blood\\". Dutch newspaper headlines are reproduced, outlining intimidating threats of murder to prominent critics of Islam, followed by footage of Eugene Armstrong's beheading. Armstrong's disembodied head is shown held up by Al-Qaeda terrorists. The Qur'an as a means for Islamic universalism Ayatollah 'Ali Meshkini speaks at a Friday sermon, declaring \\"Islam is a religion that wants to rule the world. It has done so before and eventually, will rule it again\\". The final Sura used in the film is Sura 8, verse 39: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran is quoted as saying: Ibrahim Mudeiris is seen speaking to a congregation. He says: \\"We have ruled the world before, and by Allah, the day will come when we will rule the entire world again! The day will come when we will rule America. The day will come when we rule Britain and the entire world!\\" Abdul Rahman Saleem speaks in English: \\"You will take over the USA! You will take over the UK! You will take over Europe! You will defeat them all! You will get victory! You will take over Egypt! We trust in Allah!\\" Demonstrators outside the Danish embassy to Britain are shown holding signs that read: \\"Islam will dominate the world\\" and \\"Freedom go to hell\\". Islam and the Netherlands The film's depiction of a girl being strapped down in preparation for female genital mutilation. The final segment of the film deals with issues related to Islam in the Netherlands, under the heading: \\"The Netherlands under the spell of Islam\\". These issues include opposition to democracy, Islamic views on homosexuality and women's treatment in Islam. An unidentified person claims that \\"The mosque will be part of the system of the government of Holland\\", in an apparent refusal to accept liberal democracy. Wilders juxtaposes a newspaper headline \\"Cabinet: no ban on burqa\\" against a Muslim woman fully covered up. A graph illustrating the number of Muslims in the Netherlands since 1909 is shown against a background of Muslim women. Dutch police are shown removing their shoes before entering a mosque. A Dutch Muslim expresses his desire to enact an honour killing, if his mother or sister commits zina, the Islamic concept of extramarital sex. Another condemns homosexuality, saying \\"Islam considers something like that a crime\\". A postcard is shown, ostensibly from the Netherlands, with pictures of mosques in place of visitor attractions, with the words \\"Groeten uit Nederland\\" (\\"Greetings from the Netherlands\\") superimposed. Audio recordings that are said to have been taken from mosques in the Netherlands show Imams denouncing political parties, \\"worldly concepts like liberalism [and] democracy\\". Another states that female adulterers must be \\"stoned\\" to death, even when the man commits the adultery. A graphic image of gays being hanged, under Sharia law is a depiction of a possible future dystopian Netherlands. A series of clips show female genital cutting, a woman's disembodied head lying on a floor, and a burqa-clad woman being shot through the head by a man. Finally, a succession of newspaper headlines are shown, containing stories related to Islam in the Netherlands, their views, actions, ambitions and politics. Some verified headlines are: *\\"Sudanese demand execution of British 'miss teddy bear (see Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case) *\\"Almost half of young Moroccans anti- Western\\" *\\"Throw gays from tall buildings\\" *\\"Al-Qaeda proclaims death penalty Jihad against Wilders\\" The film ends with a hand seen gripping a page of the Qur'an and a call to action from Wilders to defeat \\"Islamic ideology\\", likening it to Communism and Nazism. =Suras= An-Nisa 56, translated here as: \\"Those who have disbelieved our signs, we shall roast them in fire. Whenever their skins are cooked to a turn, we shall substitute new skins for them, that they may feel the punishment; Verily Allah is sublime and wise.\\" The following Suras are mentioned in Fitna in order of appearance. The translation is from Pickthall's The Meaning of the Glorious Koran. Only the passages marked as bold are included in the quotations in the film, while the related passages are omitted. Surat Al-Anfal (The Spoils of War) 8:60–61 Make ready for them all thou canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others beside them whom ye know not. Allah knoweth them. Whatsoever ye spend in the way of Allah it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged. And if they incline to peace, incline thou also to it, and trust in Allah. Lo! He, even He, is the Hearer, the Knower. Surat An-Nisa (The Women) 4:56–57 Lo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire. As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment. Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall make them enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow - to dwell therein for ever; there for them are pure companions—and We shall make them enter plenteous shade. Surat Muhammad (Muhammad) 47:4 Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain. Surat An-Nisa (The Women) 4:89–90 They long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve, that ye may be upon a level (with them). So choose not friends from them till they forsake their homes in the way of Allah; if they turn back (to enmity) then take them and kill them wherever ye find them, and choose no friend nor helper from among them, Except those who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant, or (those who) come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make war on you or make war on their own folk. Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace, Allah alloweth you no way against them. Surat Al-Anfal (The Spoils of War) 8:38–39 Tell those who disbelieve that if they cease (from persecution of believers) that which is past will be forgiven them; but if they return (thereto) then the example of the men of old hath already gone (before them, for a warning). And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is all for Allah. But if they cease, then lo! Allah is Seer of what they do =Differences between first and second release= The first edition used copyrighted Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons without permission. These were removed from the second edition. Also in the first edition of the film, and removed from the second edition, when referring to the murder of Theo van Gogh a picture of the Dutch rapper Salah Edin is displayed instead of the murderer Mohammed Bouyeri. The picture was shot for the rapper's album 'Nederlands Grootste Nachtmerrie' (Netherlands' Worst Nightmare), which according to the singer's website, was shot to be 'exactly like the mugshot of convicted killer Mohamed B'. A 2007 article by Dutch newspaper De Dag had captioned an article about the killer with the shot. On that occasion, Salah Edin's received an out-of-court libel settlement for the publication.\\"News\\" \\\\- page on Salah Edin's website. The photo was said by the rapper to be intended to depict \\"the way the average white Dutch citizen sees me, as a young Moroccan Muslim radical. That's why I chose to do this picture and use it for the front cover of my album. It is in no way supporting the deeds of Mohamed B.\\" Reaction International reaction to Fitna consisted of condemnation in the Muslim community, fatwās by Al-Qaeda and an Australian imam calling for the beheading of Geert Wilders, and \\"attempts\\" by Southeast Asian countries to censor the film. The Dutch government allegedly \\"distanced itself from the film\\". Several Muslim organizations and political parties have organized boycotts against Dutch products. Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country and itself a Dutch colony until 1949, has conducted a ban on several web sites, such as YouTube, MySpace, Rapidshare and Metacafe, as directed by the Ministry of Communications and Informations. On April 11, the Indonesian government lifted the ban. Indonesian communications minister Muhammad Nuh apologised to the public for the inconvenience. Geert Wilders' film failed to generate much \\"controversy\\" in Iran although the government did express its outrage on the day of its release and conservative websites complained about it for a while. By and large, Fitna elicited indifference among the general public. There was an anti-Fitna demonstration, but just 30 people turned up and they were carrying signs that had \\"nothing to do with the film\\".Iran's anti-Wilders film lacks controversy In response to the film, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen published an op-ed in the Arabic-language newspaper Asharq al Awsat on March 30. In the article, he asks of the readers to \\"keep the head cool and the relations warm\\" and urged dialogue, not provocation, as a means to bridge the cultural differences.Verhagen schrijft opiniestuk in Arabische krant Volkskrant, 30 maart 2008 On 1 April, a debate was held about the film in the Dutch parliament. In this debate, the government and Geert Wilders accused each other of lying about facts of their previous communication. According to various members of the government, Wilders had told in previous conversations about his intentions to tear parts out of the Qur'an and setting them on fire. Wilders denied this.\\"Den Haag Vandaag: debat Fitna\\" NOS/VARA/NPS =Legal actions= One of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons was included in the film without the permission of the artist, Kurt Westergaard. Westergaard has asserted that this infringes his copyright and is considering taking legal action against Wilders.\\"JP-tegner klar til sag mod Wilders\\" , Jyllands-Posten, 27 maart 2008 The Danish Union of Journalists has said it will file a lawsuit on Westergaard's behalf. Similarly Dutch director Rob Muntz announced to file a lawsuit because of the uncredited use of his interview with Theo van Gogh. In 2010 and 2011 Wilders was accused of criminally insulting religious and ethnic groups and inciting hatred and discrimination. However, he was found not guilty in June 2011. On 12 February 2009, Wilders was denied entry to the United Kingdom after being invited by the Lord Pearson of the United Kingdom Independence Party to show his film in the House of Lords. He declared this \\"a sad day for the United Kingdom\\" and accused the government of cowardice. Wilders appealed the ban, and on 13 October 2009, it was overturned by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. The UK Home Office then stated its intention not to appeal the tribunal decision, and Wilders' planned visit to the UK went ahead, with his arriving in the country on 16 October 2009. Wilders described the decision to overturn the ban as a \\"victory for freedom of speech\\". =Films made in response= On 28 March, a film was released by the Arab European League, named Al Mouftinoun.AEL Nederland: De Arabisch-Europese Liga lanceert film The film Ashkar was declared the winner on 3 May 2008. A Saudi blogger made a contra-film in April called Schism. It was also released on LiveLeak. Sequel Wilders has stated that he plans to release a sequel to Fitna. In March 2010, Wilders announced that he plans to release a second movie about the spread of Islam, but not until after Dutch elections in June. He said the sequel to his 2008 film would focus on the consequences of mass migration from Muslim countries, freedom of expression, and Sharia or Muslim law. He indicated that he received help from professionals in the US to make his film. In 2017, Wilders announced on Twitter that he was making a sequel.

Rhymed psalters include metrical psalters designed for singing, but are not limited to that use. Origins The origins of the rhymed psalter lie in twelfth-century translations from the Latin Vulgate into French. These were made in England for the French-speaking Anglo- Normans.William W. Kibler, Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (1995), p. 127. Following the Protestant Reformation rhymed metrical psalters like the Dutch Souterliedekens came into popular use for congregational singing. While singing was not the original purpose of rhymed psalters, these psalters make up the bulk of the existing rhymed versions of Bible passages. The Book of Proverbs is one of the few other Biblical books having verse translations. English rhymed psalters The oldest English rhymed psalter is a translation of the Vulgate psalms, generally dated to the reign of Henry II of England. Another rhyming psalter of much the same style is assigned epigraphically to the time of Edward II of England. The Surtees Psalter in rhymed Middle English dates from 1250 to 1300.Early Building Blocks of the English Bible In The British Isles Thomas Brampton translated the Seven Penitential Psalms from the Vulgate into rhyming verse in 1414. These and other pre-Reformation rhyming psalters demonstrate the popular use of the vernacular Scripture in England, contradicting the belief that the singing of psalms in English began only with the Reformation. \\"While Sir Thomas Wyat (died 1521) is said to have done the whole psalter, we have only Certayne Psalmes chosen out of the Psalter of David, commonly called the VII Penitential Psalmes, Drawen into English metre.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 13 Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (d. 1547) translated Psalms 55, 73, and 88 into English verse. Miles Coverdale (died 1567) translated several psalms in Goastly psalmes and spirituall songs drawen out of the Holy Scripture. The 1562 of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer contains thirty-seven rhyming psalms translated by Thomas Sternhold, fifty-eight by John Hopkins, twenty-eight by Thomas Norton, and the remainder by Robert Wisdom (Ps. 125), William Whittingham (Ps. 119 of 700 lines) and others. Sternhold's psalms had been previously published in 1549. Also in 1549, Robert Crowley translated the entire psalter in verse. The Seven Penitential Psalms were frequently translated. In 1583 William Hunnis entitled his translation \\"Seven Sobs of a Sorrowful Soul for Sinne\\". During the reign of Edward VI, Sir Thomas Smith translated ninety-two of the psalms into English verse while imprisoned in the Tower of London. A chaplain to Queen Mary I of England, calling himself the \\"symple and unlearned Syr William Forrest, preeiste\\", did a poetic version of fifty psalms in 1551. Matthew Parker, later Archbishop of Canterbury, completed a metrical psalter in 1557. The Scotch had their Psalmes buickes from 1564. One of the most renowned of Scotch versifiers of the Psalms was Robert Pont (1575). Zachary Boyd, another Scotsman, published the Psalms in verse early in the seventeenth century. The complete rhyming psalter by Sir Philip Sidney (d. 1586) and his sister, Countess of Pembroke, is notable for the variety of its versification: it employs almost all of the varieties of lyric metres typically used in its time. However, it was not published until 1823. Francis Bacon's poetic paraphrases of several psalms are distinctive because of his stately and elegant style. Richard Verstegan, a Catholic, published a rhyming version of the Seven Penitential Psalms (1601). In 1636, George Sandys published a volume containing a metrical version of other parts of the Bible together with \\"a Paraphrase upon the Psalmes of David, set to new Tunes for Private Devotion, and a Thorow Base for Voice and Instruments\\". Psalm books The Psalm Books of the various Protestant churches are mostly rhyming versions. They include: *New England Psalm Book (Boston, 1773); *Psalm Book of the Reformed Dutch Church in North America (New York, 1792); *The Bay Psalm Book (Cambridge, 1640). *Brady and Tate (poet laureate), \\"New Version of the Psalms of David\\" (Boston, 1696); *James Merrick, \\"The Psalms in English Verse\\" (Reading, England, 1765); *Isaac Watts, \\"The Psalms of David: Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, and Apply'd to the Christian State and Worship\\" (1719); *J.

Wrangham, \\"Lyra Regis\\" (Leeds, 1885); Arthur Trevor Jebb \\"A Book of Psalms\\" (London, 1898). Other rhymed passages Other parts of Holy Writ done into rhyming English verse are: *Christopher Tye's \\"The Acts of the Apostles translated into English Metre\\" (1553); *Zachary Boyd's \\"St. Matthew\\" (early seventeenth cent.); *Thomas Prince's \\"Canticles, parts of Isaias and Revelations\\" in New England Psalm Book (1758); *Henry Ainswort, \\"Solomon's Song of Songs\\" (1642); *John Mason Good's \\"Song of Songs\\" (London, 1803); *C. C. Price's \\"Acts of the Apostles\\" (New York, 1845). Other languages The French have had rhyming psalters since the \\"Sainctes Chansonettes en Rime Française\\" of Clément Marot (1540). Some Italian rhymed versions of the Bible are: * Giovanni Diodati, \\"La Sacra Bibbia\\" (2nd ed, Geneva, 1641); *Abbate Francesco Rezzano, \\"II Libro di Giobbe\\" (Nice, 1781); *Stefano Egidio Petroni, \\"Proverbi di Salomone\\" (London, 1815); *Abbate Pietro Rossi, \\"Lamentazioni di Geremia, i Sette Salmi Penitenziali e il Cantico di Mose\\" (Nizza, 1781); *Evasio Leone, \\"II Cantico de' Cantici\\" (Venice, 1793); *Francesco Campana, \\"Libro di Giuditta\\" (Nizza, 1782).

Plot The setting is a farm on the slopes of a Karoo Kopje, South Africa, during the 1870s. Fat Tant Sannie (Karin van der Laag) looks after her charges, the sweet Em (Anneke Weidemann) and the independent Lyndall (Kasha Kropinski), with a strict Biblical hand - it was Em's father's dying wish. Gentle Otto (Armin Mueller- Stahl), the farm manager, runs the farm and cares for Waldo, his son. Waldo (Luke Gallant) is bright, and busy building a model of a sheep-shearing machine that he hopes will make them all rich. Things change when the sinister, eccentric Bonaparte Blenkins (Richard E. Grant) with bulbous nose and chimney pot hat arrives. Their childhood is disrupted by the bombastic Irishman who claims blood ties with Wellington and Queen Victoria and so gains uncanny influence over the girls' gross stupid stepmother, Tant Sannie. As the story of Lyndall, Em and Waldo unfolds to its touching end, we learn not merely of a backwater in colonial history, but of the whole human condition. Olive Schreiner's intense story of three children living in the African veldt has often been compared to Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Wildly controversial at publication (1883) because of its feminist sentiments, the story has remained a touching and often wickedly funny portrayal of life on a late Victorian farm in South Africa.

The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History of the Isaac Winslow House  The Isaac Winslow House is the ancestral home of the founding family of Marshfield and was considered an avant-garde South Shore mansion. The Isaac Winslow House was built circa 1699. This was the third house built on land granted to Governor Edward Winslow (1595–1655) in the 1630s who erected the first homestead. Built by Judge Isaac Winslow, the house is virtually untouched by modernization. It has been occupied by a family of governors, generals, doctors, lawyers and judges who helped to create Marshfield and the South Shore. It survives as an example of how well-to-do landed gentry, particularly Loyalists, lived in the years prior to the American Revolutionary War. Among its occupants were General John Winslow, leader of the Massachusetts militia, who is best known for his role in the expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia—an event commemorated by Longfellow in his epic poem Evangeline. His son, Isaac Winslow, was a Loyalist doctor who quarantined and inoculated many Marshfield and Duxbury residents afflicted with smallpox. Largely because of his actions, his property was not confiscated after the Revolution. Another notable occupant was the manservant Britton Hammon, who after voyaging at sea, being captured by Indians off the coast of Florida, and his subsequent escape and reconciliation with former master John Winslow, wrote his life story, becoming among the first African-Americans to have published his work in the New World. The house remained in the Winslow family until 1822, and was later owned by Daniel Webster. It was restored and opened to the public in 1920. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.  Museum  A tour of the home shows antiques and architecture from the Winslow period, and includes items such as a chest built by Newburyport furniture maker Edmond Titcomb in 1700, and a Queen Anne dresser constructed around 1760. The Daniel Webster Law Office, a National Historic Landmark, is on the grounds of the museum. It contains original letters and artifacts relating to the former congressman, Senator and Secretary of State who lived in Marshfield for the last twenty years of his life. Also on the grounds is a carriage shed housing Webster's one-horse phaeton, as well as Marshfield's own Concord stagecoach once used to transport passengers from Marshfield to Hingham, and a brougham formerly owned by a railroad magnate. A working blacksmith shop is on site and has been a favorite spot for many Marshfield school children on field trips to the house. Across the street is the 1857 Winslow Schoolhouse, and it shows how a school day would have been conducted prior to the American Civil War. The Tea Room, built in 1920 to serve turkey dinners used to raise money for the Winslow House restoration, is still in use for functions, lectures, field trips and dinners and can be rented out by private parties. Since 1920, the Winslow House has been the property of the Winslow House Association, a non-profit group created specifically to promote and sustain the long-term well-being of the home. It is open to the public for tours on Wednesday through Sunday from Memorial Day to Columbus Day, and maintains a full schedule of dinners, lectures, concerts and other community events.

Just as in financial arbitrage, the attractiveness of jurisdiction arbitrage depends largely on its transaction costs, here the costs of switching legal service providers from one government to another. The lower the exit costs for leaving the jurisdiction (unrestricted emigration, cheap travel, liquidity of assets) the more desirable and feasible it is. Conversely, high entry costs into the more favourable jurisdiction are an inhibitor on jurisdictional arbitrage; certain tax havens such as Andorra grant permanent residency rights to immigrants only if they meet certain criteria. Jurisdictional arbitrage is a significant concept in modern free market anarcho-capitalism, not to be confused with anarchism per se.  Applications  The practice of individuals seeking asylum involves appealing to a jurisdiction with favorable individual rights for residency, where the individual's native jurisdiction is seen by them to offer insufficient protection. For example, women have fled West African nations which practice tribal female genital mutilation and/or extremist IslamNo interpretation of Islam demands female circumcision, contrary to popular opinion. See Reliance of the Traveller and Tools of the Worshipper (Umdat al-Salik), trans. Nuh Ha Mim Keller in favour of European and North American jurisdictions. In July 2019, one of the wives--Princess Haya--of the ruler of Dubai was in a London courtroom to ask the state to provide and enforce a non-molestation order for her and what is known as a forced marriage protection order for their daughters; otherwise the women would be forced to submit to the Sharia law jurisdiction of Sheikh Mohammed. =Outlawry= Jurisdictional arbitrage has also been utilized to hinder attempts at governmental prosecution, by transnational criminals such as terrorists,\\"Anti-terror measures hit formal finance\\", Oxford Analytica, 2004-05-25. Retrieved 2008-02-29. \\"This is especially important given terrorists' ability to exercise jurisdictional arbitrage.\\" money launderers, and cyber-attackers. Prior to recent international mobilization against the practice, there existed a long-standing tradition of ousted state leaders such as Erich Honecker, Idi Amin and Augusto Pinochet finding refuge and retirement abroad to avoid prosecution in their native jurisdiction. Pinochet, one-time military leader of Chile sought to evade retributive prosecution in his native jurisdiction by seeking refuge in the United Kingdom. He was later prosecuted by the Spanish court of Baltasar Garzón according to the principle of universal jurisdiction. To counteract this phenomenon, most countries have signed bilateral extradition treaties with most other countries, and some governments adopted the principle of universal jurisdiction, which has enabled individuals to be prosecuted for offences (particularly alleged human rights violations and war crimes) committed outside the jurisdiction of prosecution - the legal structure of nations such as Belgium and Spain allow for this, as does that of international tribunals operating under the aegis of the United Nations. =Tax policy= A similar attempt at governmental collusion to limit the use of jurisdictional arbitrage for tax avoidance is the policy of tax harmonization. The membership of European governments in the European Union resulted in a collection of nations with a limited set of common legal structures (Four Freedoms) which has resulted in tax competition by the otherwise less-developed nations (such as the Republic of Ireland in the early 1990s) whereby governments compete for foreign investment by lowering their tax rates significantly below those of their neighbours. This strategy has been adopted in the form of a flat tax by various Eastern European nations, which has resulted in calls for harmonization of tax rates by the traditionally more developed nations such as France, Britain and Germany. =Labour= In the view of one journalist, Microsoft's satellite office in Vancouver was set up because the US Immigration and Naturalization Service was given to restrict the immigration of programmers. The abortive and impractical Blueseed project was to launch a ship 12 nautical miles from the shore (and thus in international waters) with the goal of allowing entrepreneurs without US work visas legally to work for and create companies close to Silicon Valley.  Advocates  Anarcho-capitalists hope that by subdividing existing governmental jurisdictions into city-states (such as Singapore), competition among jurisdictions for citizens will lead to a diversity of legal climates including more favourable jurisdictions for liberty and self-determination. Cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists also cite low exit costs and fluidity of movement across jurisdictions as a significant means of advancing individual freedom through the free movement of information and capital. The concept of seasteading is an attempt to increase the possibility of jurisdictional arbitrage by decreasing the cost of switching governments. It is worth noting that there is nothing anarchist about jurisdictional arbitrage, since it is a strategy based on profiting from the differences between regulatory regimes, and therefore incompatible with the abolition of the state. A notable proponent and practitioner of jurisdictional arbitrage is Canadian businessman and perpetual traveler Calvin Ayre, founder of online gambling consortium Bodog Entertainment Group. Although online gambling is illegal in the United States, a market which accounts for 95% of Bodog's sales, the company pays no corporate taxes there as its activities are distributed across different jurisdictions to minimise tax burden. \\"We run a business that can't actually be described as gambling in each country we operate in.

It is an industrial hub and is a part of the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi. Its proximity to the burgeoning city of Gurgaon has in recent years caused its character and demographics to change dramatically. It has many factories, offices, hotels, IT parks and educational institutes. There are several sightseeing spots around the area, some overlapping with Gurgaon. Manesar is from Indira Gandhi International Airport and is located on National Highway 48, making it well connected with Delhi, Gurugram, Rewari, Dharuhera, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. History Original Manesar village was a sleepy village of about 1000 dwellings on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, then numbered as NH-8. Since the late 1990s, it has been transformed into a boom town. Its growth has been helped by government's drive to move out factories from Delhi as well as the growth of Gurgaon city and proximity to Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (approximately 40 minutes). Farmers have become millionaires or multi-millionaires by selling their lands.  Industrial Model Township  Manesar is part of the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project (DMIC) on the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC) and is also located in the influence zone of the Amritsar Delhi Kolkata Industrial Corridor (ADKIC) on the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC). Industrial Model Township, Manesar, (IMT Manesar) is a large industrial area that forms part of the DMIC. There are several large multinational companies, such as Maruti Suzuki, Jaquar, and Toshiba Eco City.

Attempts by the Government of Haryana to acquire additional land for expansion of the IMT development from 2011 led to numerous protests and legal challenges from farmers and other residents. These were resolved in 2014 when it bought a total of from three villages (Manesar, Nakhrola and Naurangpur) at a price set by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. =Manesar-Gurugram land scam= On 17 September 2015, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a First Information Report under various sections of the Indian Penal Code relating to forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy. These were in connection with alleged irregularities involving land acquisitions at IMT Manesar. Subsequently, in 2018, the former Haryana Chief Minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, together with real estate companies, officials of the state government's department of town and country planning and bureaucrats who worked with Hooda while he was Chief Minister were charged. The scam had allegedly resulted in a 15 billion INR loss to farmers in Manesar and the adjoining villages of Naurangpur and Lakhnoula whose land, amounting to , had been threatened with government purchase for \\"public purpose\\". Faced with the threat of government acquisition, farmers sold at knock-down prices, averaging 25 percent of market value, to real estate developers. The Hooda government then released the land from the acquisition threat, thus favouring the developers.Manesar land scam: Ex-Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda chargesheeted, Times of India, 2 February 2018. One of the beneficiary of the scam was Hooda's nephew, Sukhwinder, whose company was given change of land use (CLU) permission for 52 acres land on the same day the government acquisition process had lapsed for the want of release of funds, while at the same time CLU was denied to two other unrelated applicants.Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s nephew among beneficiaries of Manesar land scam: Chargesheet, Times of India, 24 February 2018. The Supreme Court of India cancelled the acquisition and grant of land to the developers and directed the CBI to inquire further. The government was instructed to \\"recover every single pie\\". Court returned the land to Haryana government. Land would not be returned to the landholders more than the prevailing price. The builders will not be allowed to recover any money they paid to land owners as the deal was done to benefit them and \\"middlemen\\".

The new city is likely to be spread across at least 50,000 hectares, which is larger than Chandigarh (11,400 hectares) but smaller than Gurgaon (73,200 hectares). Connectivity Manesar lies on National Highway 48 and is served by many local buses and states Roadways buses and trains plying on this route.

Hamantash traditionally loses this debate, and Stolper's valiant efforts resulted in no change, despite the fact that he showed adorable pictures of his dog and constant companion, Baxter.Latke-Hamantash Debate Stolper also has a healthy mythology surrounding him at the Oriental Institute. He is widely credited with the invention of \\"Stolper's Law\\", which stipulates that, when translating Akkadian, an unknown adjective is likely to mean \\"pure\\", and an unknown verb probably means \\"destroy\\". Revolutionary teaching methods have also been attributed to Stolper, who refers to himself as the \\"Stolperstein\\", or stumbling block.LEO D-E Ergebnisse für \\"Stolperstein\\" A reference to this teaching method can be found on the forthcoming Latke-Hamantash debate DVD, as the moderator cited it before Professor Stolper's speech. Stolper is also renowned for his quips concerning the Akkadian language. As one of his students fondly recalls in an entry entitled \\"Akkadian is so easy\\", he told his class: > \\"It takes only a couple of years to learn all the Akkadian you need to pass > a comprehensive exam. It takes much longer to get a degree in French Lit, so > obviously Akkadian is easier than French. Those scribes had pretty short > life spans, so it must not take too long to get good at Akkadian.

Family and Marriage He was the fourth son of Lambert Grimaldi (1420–1494) and Claudine Grimaldi (1451–1515). On 25 September 1514 he married Jeanne de Pontevès-Cabanes. The couple had at least five children; *Francesco (born c. 1516 – died young) *Claudine (born c. 1517) *Lamberto (born c. 1519 – died young ) *Rainier (born c. 1521 – died young) *Honoré (1522 – 7 October 1581) Reign A year after Lucien's reign began, Genoa broke free of France, and many of its people fled to Monaco for refuge. In December 1506, 14,000 Genoese troops besieged Monaco and its castle. The blockade lasted for five months, until Lucien was able to rout the Genoese in March 1507. Monaco, and by extension Lucien, was now in a tight spot, being subjects of France but caught in a diplomatic tight spot between France and Spain, trying to preserve its fragile independence. In 1515, Lucien bought the feudal rights over the city of Mentone, retained by the family of Anne de Lascaris, Countess of Villars, thus bringing the city, as a whole, under Monaco's sovereignty until the French Revolution. Assassination On 22 August 1523, Lucien was assassinated by his nephew, Bartholomew Doria of Dolceaqua, son of Lucien's sister Francoise Doria, at the Prince's Palace of Monaco. His body was dragged down the steps of the palace by Doria's men, to be shown to the disbelieving masses, thus inciting a riot wherein the people of Monaco chased Doria and his men out of the country. Andrea Doria, the famous admiral and a cousin to Bartholomew, is believed to have had prior knowledge of the assassination. The full extent of his compliance in this event is speculation, stemming from his being in the Port of Hercules with his squadron of ships on the day of the assassination and his having received a message from Bartholomew that was sent out of the palace just moments before Bartholomew carried out the assassination. The message was believed to have been a ruse to get rid of Lucien's major domo and twelve or fourteen of Lucien's armed men, leaving Lucien alone in the company of his nephew, but for one slave. Lucien was succeeded by his youngest son, Honoré. Notable facts *Monaco issued a stamp in Lucien's honor, in 1967. *Lucien was responsible for extensive repairs and additions to the Prince's Palace of Monaco, resulting from damage received during the Genoese siege. *Pope Adrian VI visited Monaco during Lucien's reign, in 1522. *Monaco issued a 2 euro coin for Lucien in 2012. *A painting of Lucien Grimaldi, attributed to Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, hangs in the galleries of the Princely Palace of Monaco.

Prior to that, it was administered by New Zealand. The most recent Samoan law pertaining to citizenship is the Citizenship Act 2004. One of its aims was to prevent obtention of citizenship through \\"marriages of convenience\\", by specifying that the spouse of a Samoan citizen must reside in Samoa with his or her spouse for at least five years before being granted citizenship. It also barred persons born in Samoa from automatically obtaining citizenship, if neither of their parents is Samoan.Announcement by the Prime Minister of Samoa, April 29, 2004 Obtention of citizenship Samoan citizenship may be obtained by birth, by descent, by residence or by marriage.Samoa Immigration government website A person born in Samoa of at least one Samoan parent is automatically entitled to Samoan citizenship. A person born outside Samoa may obtain citizenship by descent, provided that at least one of his or her parents is a Samoan citizen other than by descent, or that the parent in question is a Samoan citizen by descent who has lived in Samoa at various times for a combined period of three years. A person who is not of Samoan descent may apply for citizenship on the basis of residence, provided that he or she has been residing in Samoa for at least five years. The application in such cases is reviewed by the Minister for Immigration, who must take into account the applicant's health, character, intention to continue residing in Samoa, and understanding of the requirement incumbent upon Samoan citizens. A person may also apply for citizenship by marriage; the criteria are similar to those relating to an application on the basis of residence. Amongst other benefits, Samoan citizenship confers the right to vote, the right to buy land, the right to claim pension, cheaper health care, and facilitated access to employment opportunities.ibid Samoan citizenship may be renounced through a written declaration of renunciation. It may also be cancelled by the Ministry of Immigration, in cases where it was obtained through fraud, where a person who obtained citizenship through residence has ceased to reside in Samoa, or where a Samoan citizen \\"has been or is disloyal or disaffected towards Samoa\\". Samoans and Commonwealth citizenship Samoan citizens are also Commonwealth citizens, and are thereby entitled to certain rights in the United Kingdom—notably the right to vote and stand for election if legally resident in the United Kingdom. Samoans and New Zealand citizenship Samoa (as \\"Western Samoa\\") was a territory of New Zealand from the end of World War I until 1962. On 28 July 1982, the Privy Council ruled that all Samoans born between 1924 and 1948, and their children, were entitled to be New Zealand citizens. In response, the New Zealand government passed the Citizenship (Western Samoa) Act 1982. Under this new law, Samoan citizens who: * were in New Zealand on 14 September 1982; or * arrived in New Zealand as permanent residents after that date were eligible to be granted New Zealand citizenship, but other Samoans born before 1949 and their children were not. This law has been controversial. A 2003 petition asking the New Zealand Parliament to repeal the Act attracted 100,000 signatures, and the Samoan rights group Mau Sitiseni filed a petition on the issue with the United Nations International Human Rights Committee in 2007.

He represented District 49A, which included most of Edina in Hennepin County. Erhardt is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and was re-endorsed by the DFL for re-election in 2016. Until July 2008, Erhardt was a Republican and was endorsed by the Republican Party of Minnesota. For nine successive terms, he earned election victories, even when other Republicans did poorly. In 2006, he won with 59.5%.http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2006/campaign/results/sthouse_dist.php?district=41A However, over time his district, then numbered District 41A, went from Republican-leaning to becoming more of a swing district, with candidates of both major parties succeeding in the same elections.

In the 2016 election, Erhardt was defeated by Republican Dario Anselmo. Personal history Raised in Minneapolis, Erhardt graduated from Minneapolis North Community High School. He fought in the Korean War becoming a decorated combat veteran. Erhardt was awarded the Korean Medal of Honor. On return from Korea, Erhardt enrolled in the University of Minnesota graduating with a BA in Psychology and a BBA in Business. Living in Edina, Minnesota the last 41 years, Erhardt was a Financial Planner for 37 years.

He received many awards from a wide variety of organizations in recognition of his many years of service.http://ronerhardt.com His primary area of legislative work recently was in transportation. Additionally, he co- authored bills in many other areas. Previously, Erhardt served on the House Committees for Transportation Policy (Vice-Chairman), Taxes- where he, as ranking minority member, authored a major revision of Minnesota Real Property Taxes, Transportation Finance, as well as long time service on the Ways and Means Committee.http://minnesota.publicradio.org/projects/ongoing/votetracker/legislator_view.php?id=159 Erhardt, first elected to the State House in 1990 as a Republican, was re- elected eight times and served nine consecutive terms in the House of Representatives (1991-2009). During the Republican Party endorsement process in 2008, a conservative Republican obtained the Republican Party's endorsement, Keith Downey. Erhardt then entered the general election race as a Moderate Independent. Local conservative Republicans were upset with Erhardt's leadership of the over-ride of Governor Pawlenty's veto of the Transportation bill, and with his views on abortion and gay rights. In February 2008, Erhardt was in the news when he and five other Republicans in the House voted with House Democrats for a successful override of Governor Tim Pawlenty's veto of a statewide transportation bill.http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/02/25/veto/ Since 1939 only 14 vetoes have been overridden (of which 12 fall into the tenure of Independence Party Governor Jesse Ventura).http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/15942557.html Erhardt had been instrumental in the drafting of this bill which included a graduated increase in the gas tax dedicated to highway and bridge repair and construction. It also gave metro counties the option of increasing by 0.15% the sales tax to fund transit projects, an option later approved in 5 of the 7 metro area counties. The legislature's veto override vote was the first successful veto override of Pawlenty's administration. Supporters of the bill, including the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and the Minnesota Transportation Alliance, argued that an increase in funding was needed for highways and transit, especially after the nationally mourned Highway 35W bridge collapse. The flat gas tax had not been increased since 1988. Critics of the bill, including Governor Pawlenty, opposed any tax increase and also opposed investment in mass transit. Erhardt explained his vote to override the veto by pointing out that 61% of his constituents in Edina supported the bill. Electoral history since 2008 =2008= In 2008 endorsement process, Erhardt was denied the Republican endorsement after 18 years in the house as a Republican representative. There was no primary because Erhardt did not challenge the endorsed Republican candidate, Keith Downey. Instead, Erhardt competed in a three way race in the general election, running as a moderate independent, without party affiliation, stating he would caucus with the majority, if elected. Erhardt came in second in the three way race, as each of the three candidates received about one-third of the vote. Staunton and Erhardt split the moderate vote, giving conservative Republican Downey a narrow victory with 37% of votes cast. Political columnist Lori Sturdevant's post election analysis in the Star Tribune hypothesized that if it been a two way race, either Ron Erhardt or Kevin Staunton would have easily beaten Keith Downey, based on the turnout.http://fairvotemn.org/node/1050 =2010= In 2010, Ron Erhardt sought, but did not receive, the DFL endorsement for the state house. As part of the endorsement process, Erhardt agreed to abide by the party endorsement. Kevin Staunton was the endorsed DFL candidate and ran in a two way race losing to then incumbent Republican Keith Downey. =2012= In 2012, Ron Erhardt sought and received the DFL endorsement for the state house. Erhardt defeated his Republican opponent, Bill Glahn, by a 12 percent margin in the November 2012 general election. At the state legislature, Erhardt was named Chair of the House Transportation Committee. =2014= Edina's Representative Ron Erhardt ran for re-election in the November 2014 general election and was endorsed by Conservation Minnesota, The Sierra Club, Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, Minnesota Professional Firefighters, Minnesota Nurses Association, Minnesota Medical Association, Education Minnesota, DFL, Planned Parenthood of MN, SD, & ND, NARAL ProChoice Minnesota, Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association. He defeated Republican challenger Dario Anselmo. =2016= Erhardt ran for re-election in 2016. He was defeated by Republican challenger Dario Anselmo, with Anselmo garnering 51.1% of the vote to Erhardt's 48.9%, a difference of 576 votes.https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/minnesota-state-house- district-49a References External links * Rep.

He is now regarded as having been one of Australia's foremost anthropologists Early life & education Hiatt was born in Gilgandra, New South Wales, the eldest of three boys. His father was the son of English immigrants from Gloucestershire and Devonshire. Hiatt's father was a book- keeper who rose to be manager of White Wings Flour Mill. His mother was the daughter of a Gilgandra pastry cook. He graduated in dentistry at Sydney University in 1952, and, after passing over further studies to qualify as a doctor, -financial considerations ruled that out- he shifted his focus to anthropology. His choice had been influenced by a friendship he had formed with a Sri Lankan student of that topic, Laksiri Jayasuriya, during his undergraduate years at Wesley College. He re-enrolled in an arts course to major in anthropology, studying under A.P. Elkin and Mervyn Meggitt, though John Anderson also became an important influence. In 1955 as he opened a practice in Bourke. In 1952, he first encountered A.R. Radcliffe-Brown's work, in particular the latter's Structure and Function in Primitive Society. (1950) While in Bourke he met and married the first of his three wives, a school teacher Betty Meehan, who came from a notable unionist family with communist sympathies. They moved to Sydney and he graduated in anthropology at Sydney University in 1958. A scholarship took him to study at the Australian National University under John Barnes and Bill Stanner. He obtained his PhD with a thesis on 'Kinship and Conflict,' in 1963, and rewrote the manuscript for publication in 1965 as Kinship And Conflict: A Study Of An Aboriginal Community In Northern Arnhem Land. Primary ethnographic research With his wife Hiatt set off in 1959 to do his primary, detailed ethnographic fieldwork for his doctorate in, and around, Maningrida, in the Northern Territory's Arnhem Land. His focus was on the Gidjingali community of the Burarra. From the late 1950s (at which time the Australian Aboriginal community of Maningrida was first being formed and gazetted as a township), Hiatt spent more than 45 years, off and on, researching, learning and recording the views, language, songs, stories, understandings, and practices of the Burarra- speaking Gidjingarli members. It was here at Maningrida that Les developed some of his deepest, most persevering research relationships, producing at least one film and a book in memory of Frank Gurrmanamana, one of the 'informants' with whom he worked most closely. In some of his late work, Hiatt attempted to analyze the ethics and value systems of Gidjingarli culture in terms of evolutionary biology and the theories of Edward Westermarck's regarding the origins of morality. Waiting for Harry Waiting for Harry is a film dealing with the reburial of an Anbarra man, Les Angabarraparra, at Djunawunya in Arnhem Land in July 1978, when his remains had been removed from Maningrida and returned to his traditional lands. The idea came from Frank Gurramanamana after he viewed other films on Aboriginal customary life at the AIATSIS archives in Canberra. The director was Kim McKenzie, who had been running the AIAS Film Unit. The main mourners are Frank Gurramanamana, the deceased clan brother, and Harry Diama, Angabarraparra's maternal uncle and the senior blood-relative, without the presence of both of whom the ritual sequence cannot be completed. The keynote theme is Harry's repeated absences: business engagements demand his attention in a nearby town; his son is up on charges and requires the father's presence in court. These continuous interruptions upset the Cape Stewart mob, who have sailed over to attend the funeral, and who were put off by Harry's endless delays. In the meantime, various aspects of the ceremony are filmed: the painting of the hollow-log coffin, the chanting of clan songs, the gannet dance, all preliminaries before the final breaking of the bones, their arrangement in the coffin, and the interment. Hiatt, though an anthropologist, has kinship bonds with the bereaved which require him to participate actively in the proceedings he otherwise is trained to observe with an outsider's ethnographic eye. The film won the Royal Anthropological Institute Film Award in 1982 for \\"the most outstanding film on social, cultural and biological anthropology or archaeology\\". Margaret Clunies Ross dedicated a long essay to the analysis of the film in 1989. Institutional reforms and change Institutional assistance and support for 'Aboriginalist' scholarship (studies into Australian Aboriginal societies) has improved from that time when Hiatt first started his own studies, and he has since been attributed with playing an important role assisting and supporting this reform (particularly during the Whitlam and Fraser governments, with the early establishment of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Contributions to Australian anthropology In addition to Dr Hiatt's detailed ethnographic records and works, there is a substantial body of written works inquiring into, questioning and sometimes challenging some of the more conventionally 'received' anthropological knowledges held by academia and the general public about Australian Aboriginal peoples. Some of these works are identified and briefly annotated below. In one of his earliest publications, Hiatt effectively demolished the previously conventional understanding, established by the British social anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown according to which patrilineal descent is the primary social organisational principle across all Aboriginal Australians.

TICAD has been an evolving element in Japan's long-term commitment to fostering peace and stability in Africa through collaborative partnerships. \\"Japan to Increase Asian-African Aid,\\" 'New York Times. September 14, 1966. In this context, Japan has stressed the importance of \\"Africa's ownership\\" of its development as well as of the \\"partnership\\" between Africa and the international community. The exchange of views amongst the conference delegates serves to underscore the case for more, not less assistance from the major world economies.Attah, Haruna. \\"TICAD ends today Kufuor to close proceedings,\\" Acra Daily Mail. May 29, 2008. Conference chronology The TICAD conferences were intended to help to promote high-level policy dialogue amongst African leaders and their development partners. It emerged in 1993 after the end of the Cold War in an era of 'aid fatigue' among donor countries, and was critical in regenerating strong donor interest in Africa.Tembo, Fletcher (2008) \\"Where next for TICAD: Building lasting partnerships\\", London: Overseas Development Institute. TICAD has evolved into a major global forum to promote development on the continent under the principles of African \\"ownership\\" and international \\"partnership.\\" These concepts became essential factors in the launch of the New Economic Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), a strategy for development designed by Africans themselves.Adisa, Banji. \\"Japan to promote Africa's growth at Tokyo confab,\\" Nigeria Daily News. March 25, 2008. Earlier TICAD meetings have also resulted in key outcomes, in particular when Japan is hosting the G8, as it is in 2008. In 2000, for example, Japan hosted the Okinawa G8 Summit and invited leaders from several African countries to attend. Ideas proposed at TICAD II were also taken up by the G8 in the creation of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. TICAD-I TICAD I was held in 1993. African countries and their development partners discussed strategies for steps toward greater African prosperity. TICAD was formed at a time when the international community's interest in Africa was starting to wane, and donor fatigue was setting in.Blay, Gina. \\"Japan-African Forum Begins,\\" Daily Guide (Accra). May 27, 2008. This conference produced the \\"Tokyo Declaration on African Development.\\"Juma, Monica Kathina et al. (2006). Compendium of Key Documents Relating to Peace and Security in Africa, p. 491-505. Delegations from 48 African nations participated in the conference, including four heads of state:Japan, MOFA: 28 African nations Twelve other nations sent delegations; and a number of international organizations also attended as delegates and as observers. =Analysis= The conference was considered promising, but prospects remained uncertain. In the decades since that beginning, TICAD's quality has evolved in both complexity and quality. The emphasis has shifted from TICAD-I's relatively simple issues of direct aid to more multi-faceted and inter-related topics which combine in sustainable development programs.Cazzaniga, Pino. \\"From TICAD IV, a new model for fostering African development,\\" Asia News (PIME - Pontificio Istituto Missioni Estere, Rome). June 3, 2008. TICAD-II TICAD II in 1998. African countries and their development partners agreed on the \\"Tokyo Agenda for Action\\" (TAA), which was intended to become a commonly understood strategic- and action-oriented set of guidelines. Poverty reduction in Africa and Africa's fuller integration into the global economy were recognized a fundamental goals. Following the TICAD II, a 2001 ministerial conference provided opportunity to discuss NEPAD. Invitations were extended to a number of African countries and others. Some heads of state decided to attend; and a range of government ministers and others were amongst the participants in the conference. =Analysis= The agreement on an agenda was only considered a first step. TICAD-III TICAD III was held in 2003, bringing together over 1000 delegates, including 23 heads of state and the Chairperson of the African Union. African countries and their development partners reviewed the achievements of the ten-year TICAD process, and there was discussion about future direction TICAD should take. Invitations were extended to a number of African countries and others. Some heads of state decided to attend; and a range of government ministers and others were amongst the participants in the conference. =Analysis= The increase in numbers of heads of state attending signaled the modest acceptance of the forum as a potentially effective venue. Participants reaffirmed the contributions of the TICAD process to African development, noting its role in mobilizing the international community's interest and commitment to African development. \\"Africa: TICAD Participants Resolve to Improve Food Security, Economic Growth,\\" The News (Monrovia).

TICAD- IV The crisp TICAD-IV banners become something of a bright token of welcome as Yokohama Meets Africa. The TICAD-IV venue was Pacifico Yokohama, a centrally-located waterside complex. The Minato Mirai area's most recognizable feature is the bold architectural plane of the grand InterContinental Hotel -- a stark, white, sail-shaped structure silhouetted against the contrasting expanse of the harbor. TICAD IV (May 2008) was convened in Yokohama.Japan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs In its 15-year history, this was the first time the conference was convened in a city other than Tokyo. Yokohama was preparing to mark the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port and the 120th anniversary of the commencement of the City Administration. In this context, TICAD IV and the slogan, Yokohama Meets Africa were intended to underscore the international character of the port and city. \\"Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) Sets Agenda for Hope and Opportunity,\\" JCNnetwork (Japan's Corporate News). May 26, 2008. This was the most heavily attended of the four TICAD events. Responding to the invitation were 51 African nations (all except Somalia), 17 African organisations, 12 Asian nations, 22 donor nations, and 55 international organizations, with a total of about 2,500 delegates. These included 40 presidents or prime ministers of African countries, twice the number of those present at TICAD III (2003). Also in Yokohama were organizers associated with \\"official side events\\" and other participants in the conference. TICAD IV consisted of plenary sessions and twenty-four \\"thematic\\" sessions.SANGONet: \\"NGOs Frustration at TICAD IV in Japan.\\" May 26, 2008. TICAD focused on strategies for better mobilizing the knowledge and resources of the international community in the core areas of: (a) economic growth; (b) human security, including achieving the UN's Millennium Development Goals; and (c) environment/climate change issues. In addition, TICAD IV tried to identify possible inter-linkages within the context of the G8 Hokkaidō Tōyako Summit in July 2008.main themes of G* summit In this context, World Bank and International Monetary Fund Development Committee Executive Secretary, Kiyoshi Kodera, spoke at a pre-event meeting in which he argued that everyone needs to \\"accept the harsh reality\\" that sub-Saharan African countries will remain heavily dependent on foreign aid until they find a new growth path. \\"Fukuda begins marathon talks with African leaders ahead of TICAD,\\" World Bank News & Broadcast. May 27, 2008. Attending the conference were representatives of the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), a number of donor countries, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other relevant agencies. The shared perspectives of the conference delegates served to underscore the case for immediate assistance to help Africa's vulnerable economies to weather the global food and fuel crisis. Participants agreed that emergency food aid was necessary, but it was also necessary to carry out medium-to-long-term interventions, with special attention on the division of roles and complementarity among various development agencies. \\"Bank Group Participates in TICAD IV,\\" African Development Bank (Tunis). June 3, 2008. Smaller scale projects were also included in the TICAD agenda. The Japanese introduced a projected JICA investment in replicating the \\"One Village One Product movement\\" (OVOP) in African contexts. In this context, the President of Malawi's visit to Japan also included a visit to OVOP headquarters in Osaka.Khunga, Suzgo. \\"Malawi could be OVOP headquarters,\\" Daily Times (Lilongwe, Malawi). May 27, 2008. =Making a difference= In a speech delivered at TICAD-IV, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda committed the government to extending yen-denominated loans worth up to ¥415-billion (US$4-billion) and financial assistance totalling about ¥260-billion (US$2.5-billion) over the next five years. Fukuda also committed the government to establishing a fund at the Japan Bank for International Cooperation aimed at doubling investment in Africa. The financial assistance would be provided through the fund over the next five years to help develop road networks and other traffic infrastructure. The Japanese Prime Minister also announced plans to deploy a \\"water defense force\\" tasked with providing instruction in water management. Moreover, Fukuda explained that his government aimed to help foster as many as 100,000 experts in the health and medicine fields. \\"Fukuda to promise aid, loan package for Africa,\\" Yomiuri Shimbun. May 24, 2008. Fukuda's announcement that Japan would extend generous assistance to African countries in spite of its tight financial condition is aimed at burnishing Japan's credentials in the international community. Prime Minister Fukuda's speech was designed to strengthen Japan's leadership as host of the G-8 meeting because aid to Africa would be an important item on the meeting's agenda. Another reason for the government's magnanimity is that Japan is trying to strengthen its relations with African countries to win their support for its bid to gain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The Japanese government learned a lesson from the failure of its 2005 campaign for permanent membership at the Security Council: Support from African countries, which account for one-fourth of U.N. membership, is construed as indispensable if Japan is to succeed in its bid. In his speech, Fukuda said, \\"Japan would like to work on U.N. Security Council reform in cooperation with its African friends.\\" Fukuda's actions during TICAD attracted media attention for what some journalists called the \\"marathon of mini-summits.\\" In two days, the 71-year-old Prime Minister of Japan met one by one with 40 leaders of African nations, dedicating approximately twenty minutes to each one; and he also met with seven private sector Africa supporters.Kawakami, Osamu. \\"China rivalry marks TICAD IV; Government seeks African support on climate change, UN Security Council membership,\\" Daily Yomiuri. May 31, 1008. In addition, the Economy, Trade and Industry Minister, Akira Amari, met with African leaders in an effort to work towards developing closer relationships with countries participating in the conference.Tabuch, Hideharu. \\"Government securing future resources; Fukuda, Amari meet with African leaders to shore up ties for procurement,\\" Yomiuri Shimbun. May 30, 2008. During TICAD week, Amari met with the leaders of Angola, Gabon and Uganda on Tuesday and Wednesday (May 27–28). Amari met with the leaders of Madagascar, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Namibia on Thursday (May 29); and he met on Friday (May 30) with the leader of Nigeria. These Africa leaders are mainly exporters of resources necessary for manufacturers in Japan. For example, Nigeria is the biggest oil producer in Africa, and Angola has promising oil reserves. South Africa produces zirconium that is used for nuclear fuel rods, while the Democratic Republic of Congo produces cobalt, which is used by many industries for various purposes. =Analysis= Japan has long used aid as a key diplomatic tool. It was the world's top donor in 1991, but its overall assistance has been slipping as its debts increased. As China and India seeking to forge closer ties with the African continent, the conference is a key opportunity for Japan to maintain its diplomatic clout. According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Africa accounts for 89 percent of the world's total reserves of platinum, 60 percent of its diamonds, 53 percent of the cobalt, 37 percent of the zirconium and 34 percent of the chrome. \\"Opportunity to knock on Japan's door at TICAD, Gabon envoy says,\\" Japan Times. May 25, 2008. The African continent remains a potential markets for Japan; and both China and India recognized an urgent need to secure commodities to fuel their economic booms.Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC): \\"Japan to host African conference,\\" May 25, 2008. In this context, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2006 can be said to have marked a watershed for Africa's economic relations. The summit re-awakened the world's major powers not only to China's growing strategic influence in Africa but also highlighted Africa's increasing importance.Munyi, Elijah. \\"Summits and the myth of one Africa,\\" Kenya Today. May 24, 2008. In recent years, China has been providing large-scale assistance to African countries with the aim of securing a stake in the rich natural resources in the African continent; and India has been doing the same. The conference provided a venue for non-governmental entities to expand a range of high-level contacts. In addition to the World Bank, an African Development Bank (AfDB) group delegation led by the institution's president, Donald Kaberuka, attended TICAD-IV. Also amongst the 2,500 attendees were academics, such as the president of Tsukuba University in Japan and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University. There were instances when the conference did not go as Japan expected. For instance, the Japanese government planned to include a statement in the Yokohama Declaration to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent from current levels by 2050. However, the government withdrew this provision after encountering fierce opposition from South Africa, a major polluter. TICAD summits underscore the importance Asian economic and political competitors place in getting on the right side of African leaders - many of whom are sitting on huge mineral, oil and other resources. Africa is also emerging as a last frontier for financial investors. The continent also offers a growing market for low-end manufactured goods that are no longer exportable to the developed countries of Europe and America.Wa Ngai, Mbatau. \\"Africa: Continent Should Negotiate Jointly With Asians,\\" The Monitor (Kampala). June 3, 2008. African perspective African delegates arrived in Yokohama with a number of their own well-thought out agendas. Some voices argued that it would be better if Africa attended TICAD-V (2013) with a continental-wide agenda which could then be broken up into country-specific strategies which could be more fully explored during the subsequent bilateral meetings. Drawing up a common agenda detailing the trade and investment issues would seem a plausible strategy because the nations of the continent are grappling with similar challenge which include poor infrastructure and trade terms that are weighted heavily against Africa. In a sense, Thabo Mbeki embraced this continental strategy as he suggested that Africa's future economic growth should happen through trade and not aid. Mbeki said, \\"Without discounting the importance of aid, improved terms of trade for Africa are critical to ensure its full integration into the global economy.\\"Gomes, Vijay. \\"Japan pledges to double Africa aid during TICAD, explores investment opportunities,\\" International Business Times (India).

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe opened the conference by announcing a five-year $32 billion package to support infrastructure development and boost economic growth in Africa.$32bn Japanese pledge as TICAD V opens, Graphic Online, 2 June 2013 =Analysis= The conference ended as one of the largest summit meetings ever held in Japan with the participants totaling more than 4,500, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida, as well as representatives from 51 African countries including 39 heads of state and government, delegates from 31 development partner countries and Asian nations, 72 international and regional organizations, the private sector, NGOs and civil society. In addition, a variety of side events were held with much attendance from the public. TICAD V upheld the core message of \\"Hand in Hand with a More Dynamic Africa.\\" Under the concept, active discussions were conducted on the future of African development, centering on the main themes of TICAD V, namely \\"Robust and Sustainable Economy,\\" \\"Inclusive and Resilient Society,\\" and \\"Peace and Stability.\\"As an outcome, TICAD V adopted two outcome documents, namely, \\"Yokohama Declaration 2013,\\" presenting a future direction for African development, and \\"Yokohama Action Plan 2013–2017,\\" a road map for the TICAD Process over the next five years with specific measures. Since TICAD V, Japan has actively deployed its diplomacy toward Africa in order to maintain the momentum and to steadily implement its pledges. For example, the Japan–African Regional Economic Communities (RECs) Summit Roundtable was held in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly on September 26, 2013, chaired by Prime Minister Abe. In the roundtable, participants exchanged views on agricultural development and food security. In addition, from November 24 to December 5, 2013, Japan dispatched a Public and Private Sector Joint Mission for Promoting Trade and Investment for Africa to the Republic of the Congo, the Gabonese Republic, and Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, Japan hopes to further develop its relations with Africa through such follow-up measures to TICAD V. Furthermore, Prime Minister Abe visited three African countries in January 2014, fulfilling his promise at TICAD V to visit Africa in the near future.Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan TICAD VI TICAD VI will be the first TICAD to be held in Africa.

The Feminist Press was founded by Florence Howe in 1970. Before changing its name to Women’s Studies Quarterly in 1981, the publication was titled Women’s Studies Newsletter. The name change indicated a shift in the publication’s purpose and content. Along with scholarly articles, the journal publishes fiction and creative nonfiction, poetry, and the visual arts. Currently, WSQ’s bi-annual publications are based on themes. \\"Alerts and Provocations\\" informs readers about immediate political crises affecting women or regarding gender. \\"Classics Revisited\\" rereads a major text of women's and feminist studies, with a response by the original author. Book reviews and essays inform readers about recent work in the field. Other recent themes for WSQ issues have included precarious work (Fall/Winter 2017), mother (Fall Winter 2009), market (Fall/Winter 2010), and looking across the lens (Spring/Summer 2002). The Feminist Press, which is now housed at the (CUNY Graduate Center) in Midtown Manhattan, is still the sole publisher for each issue of WSQ issue. The editors-in-chief are Jillian Báez (College of Staten Island, CUNY) and Natalie Havlin (LaGuardia Community College, CUNY). The poetry editor is Patricia Smith (College of Staten Island, CUNY). The fiction and prose editor is Rosalie Morales Kearns. Previous editors-in-chief are Cynthia Chris (College of Staten Island), Matt Brim (College of Staten Island), Amy Herzog (Queens College), Joe Rollins (CUNY Graduate Center), Victoria Pitts-Taylor (Wesleyan University), and Talia Schaffer (Queens College), Cindi Katz (CUNY Graduate Center) and Nancy K. Miller (CUNY Graduate Center). In 2007, WSQ obtained the 2007 Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement of The Council of Editors of Learned Journals.  History  The journal was established in 1972 as the Women's Studies Newsletter, obtaining its current name in 1981. The first newsletter was published in 1972 and was published one time per season. On occasion there were less than four publications per year because editions condensed two seasons into one publication. As a newsletter, the topics were focused on women’s studies curriculum in all grade levels, children’s books, and receiving funding for women’s studies programs and faculty. The newsletter created the core network that transformed into the National Women’s Studies Association (NWSA) in 1977. The first issue of Women’s Studies Newsletter released in Fall 1972 begins the Front Matter with a section describing The Clearinghouse on Women’s Studies. The Clearinghouse on Women’s Studies began in 1969 in Florence Howe’s office at Goucher College. The academic field of Women’s Studies in the United States was in its early stages, and the Clearhousing on Women’s Studies was a way to connect the growing community of women’s studies scholars. In 1970, Howe asked the Modern Language Association’s executive council to enable the Clearinghouse on Women’s Studies to issue the first “Guide to Women’s Studies Courses and Programs.” Three “Guides,” or lists of women’s studies courses, were issued by the Clearinghouse between October 1971 and the summer of 1973. The Women’s Studies Newsletter was a project of Clearinghouse, which was “an education project of the Feminist Press.” The Front Matter of the 1972 newsletter dates its origins to an east coast women’s studies conference in Pittsburgh where a group decided to organize a women’s studies newsletter. The newsletter was aimed to “be a forum throughout the country for the women’s studies movement.” Individuals reading and engaging with the newsletter were interested in how to get funding for women’s studies programs and how to create jobs for people to teach these types of classes. Topics included news updates from Clearinghouse and other ongoing initiatives, academic reviews and articles, case studies from certain schools or universities, reading lists, and other topics pertinent to the expanding discipline of women’s studies throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. As the third issue went to press, the newsletter has upwards of 500 subscribers. Subscription costs ranged between one and two dollars per issue. However, once the newsletter entered its fifth year of publication (1976), the subscription list had stagnated at just under 2,000, which did not equate to the compiled list of women’s studies teachers in higher education that had grown to over 5,500. This disparity caused the newsletter to increase subscription costs moving forward. In the Fall 1976 issue, there was a proposal for a founding convention of National Women's Studies Association placed next to the edition’s editorial. NWSA became a co- publisher of the Women’s Studies Newsletter throughout 1982, at which point it returned to solely being produced by the Feminist Press.

Babylonian campaign and its outcome =Background= Following the siege of 597 BC, the Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar installed Zedekiah as vassal king of Judah, at the age of 21. However, Zedekiah revolted against Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar responded by invading Judah (). =Siege= Nebuchadnezzar began a siege of Jerusalem in December 589 BC. During this siege, the duration of which was either 18 or 30 months (see below at \\"Chronological notes\\"), the Bible describes the city as enduring horrible deprivation (; , , ). After completion of the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign (), Nebuchadnezzar broke through Jerusalem's walls, conquering the city. Zedekiah and his followers attempted to escape but were captured on the plains of Jericho and taken to Riblah. There, after seeing his sons killed, Zedekiah was blinded, bound, and taken captive to Babylon (; ; ; ; ; ), where he remained a prisoner until his death. =Aftermath= After the fall of Jerusalem, the Babylonian general Nebuzaraddan was sent to complete its destruction. Jerusalem was plundered, and Solomon's Temple was destroyed. Most of the elite were taken into captivity in Babylon. The city was razed to the ground. Only a few people were permitted to remain to tend to the land (). The Jew Gedaliah was made governor of the remnant of Judah, the Yehud Province, with a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah (; ). The Bible reports that, on hearing this news, Jews who had fled to Moab, Ammon, Edom, and in other countries returned to Judah (). Gedaliah was assassinated by Ishmael son of Nethaniah two months later, and the population that had remained and those who had returned then fled to Egypt for safety (, ). In Egypt, they settled in Migdol (it is uncertain where the Bible is referring to here, probably somewhere in the Nile Delta), Tahpanhes, Memphis (called Noph), and Pathros in the vicinity of Thebes (). Chronological notes There has been some debate as to when Nebuchadnezzar's second siege of Jerusalem took place. There is no dispute that Jerusalem fell the second time in the summer month of Tammuz (), but William F. Albright dates the end of Zedekiah's reign and the fall of Jerusalem to 587 BC, but Edwin R. Thiele offers 586 BC.Edwin Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). , . Thiele's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which he asserts was occasionally used for the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his zeroth year; his first full year would be 597/596 BC, and his eleventh year, the year that Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BC. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from Tishri in autumn, that would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BC.Leslie McFall, \\"A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\\" Bibliotheca Sacra 148 (1991) 45. The Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle (BM 21946), published in 1956, indicates that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time putting an end to the reign of Jehoaichin, on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BC, in Nebuchadnezzar's seventh year.D. J. Wiseman, Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73. gives the relative periods for the end of the two sieges as Nebuchadnezzar's seventh and eighteenth years, respectively. (The same periods are elsewhere described at as Nebuchadnezzar's eighth and nineteenth years, including his accession year.) Identification of Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year for the end of the siege places the event in the summer of 587 BC.

The fish is farmed in ponds for use in human consumption in countries such as Thailand () and the Philippines. However, native populations now face extinction due to man-made activities and genetic introgression due to interbreeding with escaped aquaculture hybrids. In Thailand both this fish and the walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) are known as Pla Duk (). They are common inexpensive food items, prepared in a variety of ways, being often offered by street vendors, especially barbecued or fried.Pla duk Description The broadhead catfish is identified by its large dorsal fin and its short and rounded occipital process. The occipital process is pointed in Clarias batrachus, a closely related species. Another identifying feature for the broadhead catfish is the white spots on the side of its black body. The male and the female catfish can be identified by looking at their anus. The males have elongated urogenital papillae around their anus while the females only have a round opening. The males can reach lengths of up to 120 cm (47.2 inches) TL. Habitat and distribution The broadhead catfish prefers the Benthopelagic zone and can survive in both brackish and fresh water. The fish stays in tropical climates ranging in the 34°N - 4°N latitudes. As such, the fish is found in tropical Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Guam, and the Philippines. Clarias macrocephalus prefers living in marshes, canals, rice fields, stagnant pools and rivers. Should the water evaporate during the dry seasons, the fish is able to lie buried for a long time. Should there be a need to relocate, the fish can move out of the water using its extended fins. The fish, together with other members of the genus Clarias are threatened by man-made activities such as urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and exploitation by the expanding aquaculture business. The catfish population is also threatened by escaped hybrids born from female C. macrocephalus and male introduced C. gariepinus. The hybrid is able to breed with both species and could cause a genetic introgression which could result in species extinction. The hybrid also grows faster than the native fish and might outcompete the native stock for resources. Ecology and life history As a carnivore, it feeds on aquatic insects, young shrimp and smaller fishes. However, it can also eat rice bran, kitchen refuse, fish meal, or formulated feeds. In turn, the fish is attacked by Achlya, Aphanomyces, and Pythium. In the wild, the fish spawns in small streams. The fish does not, however, spawn on its own in captivity. Spawning must be induced by injecting mature females with hormones. The eggs from the female are removed while milt, obtained from the reproductive tract of sacrificed males, are introduced. The resulting catfish larvae can be fed with newly hatched brine shrimp and water fleas four to five days after hatching. After more than one month, the fingerlings can be transferred to grow-out ponds. Importance to humans Catfish street food in Chonburi, Thailand The catfish is sold commercially as live or frozen. It is prepared by either frying, broiling or baking it. The fish is can also be packaged in cans though its black skin should be removed as it looks unattractive. The fish is cultivated but only in small scale fish ponds as it has shown a slow growth rate and a small amount of fry even though it is more preferred due to its appearance and eating quality. In Thailand, the fish considered better and more nourishing than the walking catfish.

It is a Slovak national cultural landmark, protected since 1963 for retaining its historical value and being a testament of the urbanistic and architectonic features of historical Lamač.http://www.pamiatky.sk/pamiatky/data/obrazky/File/elektronicka_tabula/PU_06_359_17_6961_KAL.pdf It is named after Saint Rosalia and it is owned by the city of Bratislava.  Geography  The building is situated in Lamač, a borough of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.  History  The people of Bratislava built the chapel out of gratitude for the end of an outbreak of plague in the years 1678 - 1679 which had a toll of 12 thousand dead. It was built in the years 1680 – 1682 by the city of Bratislava and the construction was financed from public donations of citizens. Since its completion until today it has had no renovations, only the repairs occasioned by use and time with the last major repairs in the years 1974 - 1975. The main cross was replaced after being struck by lightning at the beginning of the 20th century. A tradition evolved over time when each year on Saint Rosalia day on September 4, there used to be pilgrimages to this chapel. This tradition disappeared during World War II. Today, there are local festivities () at this day and there is a special mass celebrated in the chapel. In 2017, the Slovak Roman Catholic Church started negotiations with the city of Bratislava to buy and reconstruct the chapel. On March 7, 2017 the local council of the borough of Lamač obliged the Mayor of Lamač to negotiate with the city the transfer of ownership of the chapel from the city to the city borough in case the negotiations between the city and the Roman Catholic Church should fail.  Patron of the chapel  The chapel is sacred to Saint Rosalia, the patron against plague. She was born to a wealthy family. As an adult, she left her family's home and lived as a wandering mendicant. Rosalia died on September 4, 1160. She became the symbol fight against indulgence, regarded as an ideal of self-control. She is often depicted as a sleeping lady in a cave with a lot of colorful and flourishing roses around her.

Description  The author of Meat Is Murder!, Mikita Brottman received her Ph.D. in English Language and Literature from Oxford University, taught Comparative Literature at Indiana University as a Visiting Assistant Professor, served as a professor at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, and is currently on the staff of the Pacifica Graduate Institute. Brottman's writings on film and film culture have appeared in Film Quarterly, Literature Film Quarterly and indieWire, where she regularly covers international film festivals. Meat is Murder! is the eighth volume in Creation Books' series on extreme cinema. The book deals not only with film portrayals of cannibalism, but also with societal and historical aspects of the phenomenon. One of Brottman's points in the study is that recounting stories of the horror of the cannibalism taboo—whether through myth, fairy tale, true crime or film—actually strengthens our communal ties.Brevard Community College. \\"Meat is Murder! An illustrated guide to Cannibal Culture. (Book Reviews).\\" The Journal of Popular Culture (March 22, 2001) Meat is Murder! is broken into three sections dealing with different aspects of cannibalism. The first part deals with cultural cannibalism. This aspect of the subject is further broken down into sections dealing with dietary, symbolic, and hunger. Criminal and psychotic cannibalism make up the second part of the book, featuring descriptions of notorious real-life cannibals. Cannibalism as it is portrayed in popular culture finishes this section of the book. The last third of the book discusses the portrayal of cannibalism in film. The first part of this section covers documentaries and art-house films such as Paul Bartel's Eating Raoul (1982) and Peter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover (1989). The second chapter of this section of the book covers films on individuals who cannibalize, and the third chapter is on cannibal families or societies. Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust (1980) are among the films given coverage in this chapter. In the section on cannibal cinema, Mikita Brottman asserts that the subject is more widespread than is commonly assumed. She shows that cannibalism is a subject which has been portrayed in all time periods through film history, in films such as the 1908 silent comedy King of the Cannibal Islands, through David F. Friedman's exploitation \\"documentary\\" Cannibal Island (1956), through Soylent Green (1973), Alive (1993), and Ridley Scott's Hannibal (2001). Critical appraisal Humanities and Social Sciences Online calls the Meat is Murder! a \\"gruesome but fascinating tour through the anthropological, criminological, literary, and cinematic history of cannibalism\\". Reviewer Philip Simpson judges that the book is \\"compelling\\" and takes a scholarly approach to its subject matter. The Headpress Guide to the Counter Culture (2004) points out that Brottman is not condescending to her subject matter, but criticizes the book for its lengthy film synopses. The review also deems the illustrations in the book to be of a poor quality. The Journal of Popular Culture writes that Brottman's theories as to the communal ties created through the horror of the subject of cannibalism are \\"argued persuasively\\". Reviews reprinted at the book's publisher's site include Total Film, which calls Brottman's work, \\"worryingly exhaustive, [and] hungrily informed,\\" and Terrorizer which writes that the book is \\"an informed study of both cultural and cinematic cannibalism... [which] combines meticulous research with a fascinating insight into the origins of cannibalism, infamous real-life perpetrators and the celluloid treatment of the subject.\\" Film Review labeled the book, \\"An excellent study of cannibal culture.\\" References Further reading * Brevard Community College. \\"Meat is Murder!

Baker circa 1909 Bernard Nadal Baker (11 May 1854 – 20 December 1918) was a shipping magnate from Baltimore, Maryland. Baker descended from generations of wealthy Baltimore merchants and glass manufacturers. He studied in Philadelphia with the geologist and chemist Frederick Genth and was a special student at Yale College. In the 1880 Census Baker identified himself as a glass manufacturer, but he had also founded three businesses supplying coal, tugs, and lighters and cold storage facilities in Baltimore harbor. Although the U.S. mercantile marine had been declining for decades in the face of British competition and high domestic operating costs, Baker’s ambition was to build a major American owned transatlantic steamship line in Baltimore. In 1881, with the support of the Pennsylvania Railroad (which wanted a transatlantic outlet for its freight business) Baker established the Atlantic Transport Line (A.T.L.). Shipping freight and livestock from Baltimore and Philadelphia, Baker quickly became the second-largest American steamship operator. In 1892 he initiated the exclusively first class direct London to New York passenger service for which the A.T.L. became famous. Baker’s move to sell the line to his principal British competitor in the late 1890s led to the creation of J Pierpont Morgan's colossal International Mercantile Marine Company (IMM) in 1902 through the merger of the A.T.L. and six other companies. Baker effectively retired from the shipping business when the IMM was formed and lost much of his fortune when the IMM shares for which he exchanged his A.T.L. shares plummeted in value. But he had gained an international reputation as an authority on shipping and was consulted by the U.S. Government on the Panama Canal and was one of four experts appointed for a National Sub-Committee on Transportation Problems. He supplied much of the data for the contentious shipping bill in 1915, and having been one of the moving spirits in its creation, he was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson as one of the five members of the United States Shipping Board during World War I. Baker held many directorships and other positions, and was for example a Trustee of Johns Hopkins University, President of the Conservation Congress, and a member of the Baltimore-based Moral Education Board. But despite his wealth and influence he had no active interest in politics. Described as \\"large of heart and of indefatigable energy,\\" Baker was a determined and skilled executive who was not afraid to use new methods or to branch out into new lines of business. He was remarkably successful in all of his ventures but a newspaper article of the day commented that \\"he lives modestly and gives a great deal of his money away.\\" He lent vessels to carry grain to starving Russians and for use as hospital ships in time of war, and he gave large sums to a wide variety of worthy causes. Baker was an Anglophile who supposedly knew England almost as well as he knew Maryland. He married Elizabeth Livezey in 1877 and the couple had two daughters, of whom Marguerite Harrison had an adventure-filled life as a journalist, moviemaker, and spy. In 1889, Baker built a 49-room Georgian mansion \\"Ingleside\\" in Catonsville. In 1916 Baker married Rosalie Barry and fathered a third daughter. Baker was wintering in California when he was taken ill and died in December 1918. A chair in chemistry at Johns Hopkins University and a World War II Baltimore-built Liberty Ship were named after him.

Tiling arrays are a subtype of microarray chips. Like traditional microarrays, they function by hybridizing labeled DNA or RNA target molecules to probes fixed onto a solid surface. Tiling arrays differ from traditional microarrays in the nature of the probes. Instead of probing for sequences of known or predicted genes that may be dispersed throughout the genome, tiling arrays probe intensively for sequences which are known to exist in a contiguous region. This is useful for characterizing regions that are sequenced, but whose local functions are largely unknown. Tiling arrays aid in transcriptome mapping as well as in discovering sites of DNA/protein interaction (ChIP-chip, DamID), of DNA methylation (MeDIP-chip) and of sensitivity to DNase (DNase Chip) and array CGH. In addition to detecting previously unidentified genes and regulatory sequences, improved quantification of transcription products is possible. Specific probes are present in millions of copies (as opposed to only several in traditional arrays) within an array unit called a feature, with anywhere from 10,000 to more than 6,000,000 different features per array. Variable mapping resolutions are obtainable by adjusting the amount of sequence overlap between probes, or the amount of known base pairs between probe sequences, as well as probe length. For smaller genomes such as Arabidopsis, whole genomes can be examined. Tiling arrays are a useful tool in genome-wide association studies.  Synthesis and manufacturers  The two main ways of synthesizing tiling arrays are photolithographic manufacturing and mechanical spotting or printing. The first method involves in situ synthesis where probes, approximately 25bp, are built on the surface of the chip. These arrays can hold up to 6 million discrete features, each of which contains millions of copies of one probe. The other way of synthesizing tiling array chips is via mechanically printing probes onto the chip. This is done by using automated machines with pins that place the previously synthesized probes onto the surface. Due to the size restriction of the pins, these chips can hold up to nearly 400,000 features. Three manufacturers of tiling arrays are Affymetrix, NimbleGen and Agilent. Their products vary in probe length and spacing. ArrayExplorer.com is a free web-server to compare tiling arrays.  Applications and types  Overview of ChIP-chip procedure. = ChIP-chip = ChIP-chip is one of the most popular usages of tiling arrays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation allows binding sites of proteins to be identified. A genome-wide variation of this is known as ChIP-on-chip. Proteins that bind to chromatin are cross-linked in vivo, usually via fixation with formaldehyde. The chromatin is then fragmented and exposed to antibodies specific to the protein of interest. These complexes are then precipitated. The DNA is then isolated and purified. With traditional DNA microarrays, the immunoprecipitated DNA is hybridized to the chip, which contains probes that are designed to cover representative genome regions. Overlapping probes or probes in very close proximity can be used. This gives an unbiased analysis with high resolution. Besides these advantages, tiling arrays show high reproducibility and with overlapping probes spanning large segments of the genome, tiling arrays can interrogate protein binding sites, which harbor repeats. ChIP-chip experiments have been able to identify binding sites of transcription factors across the genome in yeast, drosophila and a few mammalian species. Overview of transcriptome mapping procedure. = Transcriptome mapping = Another popular use of tiling arrays is in finding expressed genes. Traditional methods of gene prediction for annotation of genomic sequences have had problems when used to map the transcriptome, such as not producing an accurate structure of the genes and also missing transcripts entirely. The method of sequencing cDNA to find transcribed genes also runs into problems, such as failing to detect rare or very short RNA molecules, and so do not detect genes that are active only in response to signals or specific to a time frame. Tiling arrays can solve these issues. Due to the high resolution and sensitivity, even small and rare molecules can be detected. The overlapping nature of the probes also allows detection of non- polyadenylated RNA and can produce a more precise picture of gene structure. Earlier studies on chromosome 21 and 22 showed the power of tiling arrays for identifying transcription units. The authors used 25-mer probes that were 35bp apart, spanning the entire chromosomes. Labeled targets were made from polyadenylated RNA. They found many more transcripts than predicted and 90% were outside of annotated exons. Another study with Arabidopsis used high- density oligonucleotide arrays that cover the entire genome. More than 10 times more transcripts were found than predicted by ESTs and other prediction tools. Also found were novel transcripts in the centromeric regions where it was thought that no genes are actively expressed. Many noncoding and natural antisense RNA have been identified using tiling arrays. Overview of MeDIP-chip procedure. = MeDIP-chip = Methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation followed by tiling array allows DNA methylation mapping and measurement across the genome. DNA is methylated on cytosine in CG di-nucleotides in many places in the genome. This modification is one of the best-understood inherited epigenetic changes and is shown to affect gene expression. Mapping these sites can add to the knowledge of expressed genes and also epigenetic regulation on a genome- wide level. Tiling array studies have generated high-resolution methylation maps for the Arabidopsis genome to generate the first \\"methylome\\". Overview of DNase-chip procedure. = DNase-chip = DNase chip is an application of tiling arrays to identify hypersensitive sites, segments of open chromatin that are more readily cleaved by DNaseI. DNaseI cleaving produces larger fragments of around 1.2kb in size. These hypersensitive sites have been shown to accurately predict regulatory elements such as promoter regions, enhancers and silencers. Historically, the method uses Southern blotting to find digested fragments. Tiling arrays have allowed researchers to apply the technique on a genome-wide scale. = Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) = Array-based CGH is a technique often used in diagnostics to compare differences between types of DNA, such as normal cells vs. cancer cells. Two types of tiling arrays are commonly used for array CGH, whole genome and fine tiled. The whole genome approach would be useful in identifying copy number variations with high resolution. On the other hand, fine-tiled array CGH would produce ultrahigh resolution to find other abnormalities such as breakpoints.  Procedure  Workflow of tiling array procedure. Several different methods exist for tiling an array. One protocol for analyzing gene expression involves first isolating total RNA. This is then purified of rRNA molecules. The RNA is copied into double stranded DNA, which is subsequently amplified and in vitro transcribed to cRNA. The product is split into triplicates to produce dsDNA, which is then fragmented and labeled. Finally, the samples are hybridized to the tiling array chip. The signals from the chip are scanned and interpreted by computers. Various software and algorithms are available for data analysis and vary in benefits depending on the manufacturer of the chip. For Affymetrix chips, the model-based analysis of tiling array (MAT) or hypergeometric analysis of tiling-arrays (HAT) are effective peak-seeking algorithms. For NimbleGen chips, TAMAL is more suitable for locating binding sites. Alternative algorithms include MA2C and TileScope, which are less complicated to operate. The Joint binding deconvolution algorithm is commonly used for Agilent chips. If sequence analysis of binding site or annotation of the genome is required then programs like MEME, Gibbs Motif Sampler, Cis- regulatory element annotation system and Galaxy are used.  Advantages and disadvantages  Tiling arrays provide an unbiased tool to investigate protein binding, gene expression and gene structure on a genome-wide scope. They allow a new level of insight in studying the transcriptome and methylome. Drawbacks include the cost of tiling array kits. Although prices have fallen in the last several years, the price makes it impractical to use genome-wide tiling arrays for mammalian and other large genomes. Another issue is the \\"transcriptional noise\\" produced by its ultra-sensitive detection capability. Furthermore, the approach provides no clearly defined start or stop to regions of interest identified by the array. Finally, arrays usually give only chromosome and position numbers, often necessitating sequencing as a separate step (although some modern arrays do give sequence information.)

As an example, a local machine can access a hard disk drive that is attached to another computer. The protocol was originally developed for Linux 2.1.55 and released in 1997https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3778. In 2011 the protocol was revised, formally documented, and is now developed as a collaborative open standard. There are several interoperable clients and servers. There are Linux-compatible NBD implementations for FreeBSD and other operating systems. The term 'network block device' is sometimes also used generically. Technically, a network block device is realized by three components: the server part, the client part, and the network between them. On the client machine, on which is the device node, a kernel driver controls the device. Whenever a program tries to access the device, the kernel driver forwards the request (if the client part is not fully implemented in the kernel it can be done with help of a userspace program) to the server machine, on which the data resides physically. On the server machine, requests from the client are handled by a userspace program. Network block device servers are typically implemented as a userspace program running on a general-purpose computer. All of the function specific to network block device servers can reside in a userspace process because the process communicates with the client via conventional sockets and accesses the storage via a conventional file system interface. The network block device client module is available on some Unix- like operating systems, including Linux and Bitrig. Since the server is a userspace program, it can potentially run on every Unix-like platform; for example, NBD's server part has been ported to Solaris.

Maltese Italian is the Italian language spoken in Malta. It has received some influences from the Maltese language. History Tri-lingual voting document for the later cancelled 1930 elections in Malta Enrico Mizzi (Prime Minister of Malta in 1950) was jailed in 1940 also for his pro-Italian language opinions For many centuries since the Middle Ages and until 1934, Italian was the official language of Malta. Indeed, it was considered the language of culture in Malta since the Italian Renaissance. In the 19th century Italian irredentists and Italian Maltese wanted to promote its use throughout Malta for plans to re- unify it to Italy as Malta was part of the Kingdom of Sicily up to 13th century. In the first decades of the 20th century there was even a struggle within Maltese society and politics over the \\"language problem\\", which came to a head before World War II. Although only the rich could speak Italian, it was however understood by nearly all the population, and with Maltese being generally spoken by those less well-off, Italian was used as the official language in Malta until 1934. But in 1933 the Constitution was withdrawn over the Government's budgetary vote for the teaching of Italian in elementary schools. and furthermore the Italian was dropped by the British authorities from official language status in Malta in 1934, its place being taken by Maltese. In 1935 there were manifestations against all these decisions, promoted by the Maltese fascists: the Nationalist Party of Enrico Mizzi declared that most of the Maltese population was supporting directly or indirectly the Italian Maltese's struggle. One of the most fanatical supporters of the Italian language in Malta was Carmelo Borg Pisani. The greatest Italian-speaking Maltese of the second half of the 20th century is Vincenzo Maria Pellegrini (1911-1997), who wrote most of his works in Italian and composed a poem in Maltese Italian in honor of Garibaldi in 1982, a hundred years after the death of 'Hero of the two worlds'. Since the 1950s there has been a huge increase of Maltese people who are able to speak/understand the Italian language, thanks mainly to the broadcasts of the Italian television: from 15% (nearly 40,000) in 1950 to 36% (145,000) in 2002 and to 86% (360,000) in 2010Scarso, Vincenzo. \\"Ragusa Oggi\\". La lingua italiana nel Maltese. Ragusa, March 2017. Furthermore, since 1970 the Maltese Italian is being considered for possible reinstatement as official language in Malta. In 1981, the government of Malta began to publish the monthly magazine Lo Stivale in Maltese Italian. The Malta Constitution allows 3 languages to be official in Malta and this rule is favorable to the reinstatement of the Italian languageItalian language in Malta. Since 1970 the Maltese Italian is being considered for possible reinstatement as official language in Malta. In 1981 was started to be published by the Malta government the monthly magazine Lo Stivale in Italian of Malta.

Initially a Trotskyist in the 1930s, he espoused fascism during World War II, joining the SS Charlemagne Division. Soon after the end of the war, Binet became involved in numerous neo-fascist and white supremacist publications and parties, and wrote the 1950 book Théorie du racisme, deemed influential on the far-right at large. He died in a car accident, aged 44. Biography = Early life and communist activism = René Valentin Binet was born on 16 October 1913 in Darnétal, Seine-Maritime., s.v. Binet René, Valentin. He became a communist sympathizer in high school following a trip to the Soviet Union. Aged 16 in 1930, Binet joined the French Communist Youth and became the secretary of its local Le Havre section, before getting expelled from that group in 1934 after he supported Jacques Doriot's ideas of \\"common front\\" (front unique). Binet then moved towards the Fourth International, joining Pierre Frank and Raymond Molinier around the journal La Commune. In March 1936, he became a founding member of Molinier's Parti Communiste Internationaliste (PCI) following his election to the party's Central Committee. Binet was also a member the Le Havre employees trade union's countcil, but he got expelled in February 1937 because after he refused to follow the internal refereeing procedure. When the PCI was dissolved in December 1938 to merge into the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (POSP), Binet withdrew from the group and continued his own journal, Le Prolétaire du Havre. His group sent an observer to the 3rd congress of the Internationalist Workers Party (POI) in January 1939, a rival organization of the PCI led by Pierre Naville and Jean Rous. Binet wrote in his memoirs that he felt hatred for the Soviet Union and the Jews during the period 1934–1939. =SS Charlemagne Division= In 1940, Binet was taken as a prisoner-of-war by the Germans for a time, then liberated. Whilst held in a prisoner camp, he moved from his anti-Stalinist stance to become a supporter of Nazism, serving as a staff sergeant in the SS Charlemagne Division from 1944. In 1943, the Comité Communiste Internationaliste published a \\"warning\\" about Binet, dismissing him as a traitor to the Trotskyist cause. =Neo-fascist activism= After the war, Binet spent 6 months in a French prison for serving in the German military, then returned to political activism. He founded the bulletin Le Drapeau Noir to defend \\"the demands of the soldiers of the East\\" – that is former Waffen-SS and LVF members. His sympathizers belonged to the Front Noir, a clandestine organization that contemplated armed struggle in order to build a \\"new Europe\\" relying on fascism. The organization had linked with other neo- fascist groups abroad via a Front Noir International and a Secours Noir International, which acted as an \\"embryonic\\" and \\"ephemeral\\" transnational union of fascist activists according to political scientist Jean-Paul Gautier. Binet also collaborated with Marc Augier (also known as \\"Saint-Loup\\") in founding the journal Combattant européen in March 1946. In the late 1940s, he helped set up a number of political parties and organizations. Binet founded the Parti Républicain d'Unité Populaire (PRUP) in 1946, which adopted the slogan \\"France for the Real French!\\". According to scholar James G. Shields, the PRUP followed \\"an ideological hotchpotch mixing nationalism with Europeanism and socialist themes with collaborationist sympathies.\\" The party had around 150 members and joined forces with the Rassemblement Travailliste Français to contest the 1947 municipal elections. Following an electoral defeat, Binet converted the PRUP into the Mouvement Socialiste d'Unité Française (MSUF) in 1948. Its periodical, L'Unité, led a campaign against the Épuration of Nazi collaborators and demanded the departure of Arabs from France to stop an alleged \\"African invasion\\". The party, which had 250 members at most, was banned by the authorities in March 1949. From 1949 to 1952, Binet published two bulletins: L'Étincelle, which appeared irregularly published, and Sentinelle, where one could read the contributions of Jean-André Faucher, Karl-Heinz Priester or Gaston-Armand Amaudruz. In Sentinelle, Binet advocated his views on \\"national socialism\\" and \\"scientific racism\\" while promoting the establishment of a \\"fascist international\\". = New European Order = In July 1950, Binet launched the magazine Le Nouveau Prométhée, where he developed his theories on \\"biological realism\\". The text published in the first issue was adapted the same year as a brochure entitled Théorie du racisme to serve as a doctrinal pamphlet advocating racial separation. The magazine disappeared after one year of existence. Binet also became close to Maurice Bardèche and the Comité National Français. He accompanied Bardèche in 1951 to the meeting in Malmö that saw the formation of the European Social Movement. However, Binet soon broke from the new group which he felt did not go far enough in terms of racialism and anti-communism, and joined instead Amaudruz in establishing the Zurich-based New European Order as a more radical alternative. The group called at its founding for a \\"European racial policy\\" to improve the European gene pool via eugenicist interventions and control of ethnic inter-marriages. Binet aimed to federate the nationalists of Europe – from former Waffen-SS members to former resistance fighter – against what he called the Russo-American occupation of the continent by \\"niggers\\", \\"Mongols\\" and \\"Jews\\". = Later life and death = In the later years of his life, Binet worked as a librarian, running the small publishing house Comptoir National du Livre, then led a property development company called Baticoop. He died in a car accident on 16 October 1957 in Pontoise, the day of his 44th birthday. Noted for his domineering personality, Binet was not always popular with his far right colleagues, leading to allegations that some of them may have arranged his death.Rees, Philip (1990). Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster. p.36 Fellow fascist writer Maurice Bardèche described him as a \\"fascist of the puritan type who spends his life founding parties and publishing roneotyped newspapers\\".  Views and influence  Binet advocated the \\"inequality of the human races\\" and a \\"social racism\\", calling for the \\"purification of the French race of the elements which pollute it\\". His 1950 book Théorie du racisme ('Theory on racim') promotes the concept of \\"biological realism\\", that is the establishment of individual and racial inequalities based upon pseudo-scientific observations. Binet argued that \\"interbreeding capitalism\\" (capitalisme métisseur) aimed at creating a \\"uniform inhumanity\\" (barbarie uniforme), and that only \\"a true socialism\\" could \\"achieve race liberation\\" through the \\"absolute segregation at both global and national level.\\" In Contribution à une éthique raciste ('Contribution to a racist ethics'), published postumuously in 1975, Binet defends the \\"superiority of the European man and the white race\\" and advocates a \\"racist revolution\\" to implement a \\"dictatorship of races\\". Binet's ideas, characterized by a worldwide \\"biological-cultural deal\\" where each group would remain sovereign in its own region, foreshadowed both the racialism of Europe- Action (1963–1966) and the ethno-pluralism of GRECE (1968–present). Scholas have also linked Binet's concept of \\"interbreeding capitalism\\" with Renaud Camus' idea of \\"global replacism\\" – a \\"replaceable human, without any national, ethnic or cultural specificity\\" –, which forms the foundation of his Great Replacement conspiracy theory.

Obtention of citizenship Tonga's ConstitutionConstitution of Tonga (1875) does not include a specific clause on nationality or citizenship. However, clause 29 pertains to naturalisation: :Any foreigner after he has resided in the Kingdom for the space of five years or more may with the consent of the King take the oath of allegiance and he may be granted Letters of Naturalization and all naturalized subjects shall have the same rights and privileges as native born subjects of Tonga with the exception that they shall not be entitled to the rights of hereditary tax allotments. Specific legislation, therefore, defines nationality and citizenship. The most recent piece of legislation, in 2007, was the Nationality (Amendment) Act, designed to revoke the ban on dual citizenship. At present, Tongan nationality may be obtained by birth in Tonga to a Tongan parent, by birth abroad to a Tongan parent, by marriage, and by naturalisation.

He was crucified during the persecution of Christians under the Roman emperor Trajan. Life The hieromartyr Astius was born an Illyrian. Astius was bishop of the city of Durrës (Dyrrachium), during the time of the emperor Trajan (98–117). The saint once had a dream, a foreboding of his impending suffering and death for Christ.

This gurdwara sahib is dedicated to the first Sikh Guru, Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Gurdwara Nanak Piao was built at the site, in the garden where Guru Nanak Dev camped when he visited Delhi in 1505 during the reign of Sultan Sikandar Lodi. It is situated on Rana Pratap Road (also known as Grand Trunk Road or GT Road). It is said that people flocked to the revered prophet and offered him and Bhai Mardana precious gifts and offerings. Guru Nanak Dev Ji used to distribute all these offerings to the poor and needy. Besides this, he used to offer food and water to the hungry and thirsty, hence the name of the shrine. The word \\"Piao\\" mean to \\"offer liquid to drink\\" and refers to the offering of water to all the thirsty who visited this shrine. Even today, the Well used by the Guru is preserved and one can still see the well from which Guru Nanak served water at the shrine. Consequently, over time Gurdwara Nank Piao attained a status of a holy and revered historical shrine. Guru Nanak Dev was an apostle of peace, brotherhood, non-violence and amity. His sermons created very uplifting and healthy impact on the people who bowed before him as respect for his spiritual guidance. The garden surrounding the Gurdwara became a place of pilgrimage for the people from all over Delhi. This is where they received the message of spiritual deliverance. History Guru Nanak Dev's Parkash Purab. A story goes that during his stay in Delhi, rumours spread that Guru Nanak by the grace of God had revived a dead elephant. Emperor Sikander Shah Lodi came to know about this holy man who had won the admiration of all the Hindu and Muslim divines of Delhi and had brought a dead elephant to life. It is said that when one of his favourite royal elephants died, he sent for the Guru and requested him to revive his elephant too. But the Guru refused to oblige him. Consequently, the Guru was immediately imprisoned. In the prison his deep compassion for the suffering of prisoners had a great moral and spiritual influence on the prison officials. They informed the Emperor that Guru Nanak was not an idolater and that as a saint he was greatly respected all the people including Hindus and Muslims. A strange thing happened during the imprisonment of Guru Nanak. A great earthquake shook the capital on 3 July 1505. According to a chronicler \\"the mountains were overturned and lofty edifices were dashed to the ground. The living thought the day of judgment had come and for dead the day of resurrection\\". Many thought that the new Faqir Nanak who had been imprisoned by the Emperor had cursed the King and the empire. This or some other equally strong influence like the intervention of the Chisti Sufi saints changed the mind of Emperor and he ordered the release of the Guru Nanak and at his request many other prisoners were released with the Guru.

History  Mission Data Interface (MDI) is a spin-off project from the Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support System (CVTSC) system – which is installed on all current deployed US aircraft carriers. MDI was originally intended to extend the CVTSC/SSDS interfaces to share mission data with other remote battle group and theater-level (WAN internet scale) participants configured with the MDI capability. Mission data are all data generated during a mission, including electrical notes, commands, and even operator views. These data can be share among all systems within the battle space in near real-time; as well as recorded for post-mission analysis and training. The proposal to establish the MDI project was submitted to Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Keyport management sometime in late 2004. The project was approved by IWS5 Program Office and work started sometime in 2005. MDI contains 2 major API libraries: RMI-based API and web services-based API.

The planet is in fact Earth, and he teams up with natives of the alien planet, humans, in his attempt to stop the smuggling of a dangerous drug (tobacco) to Sirius.

It is published monthly by Školska knjiga.  History  Modra lasta logo The very first issue, titled Djeca za Djecu ([By] Children for Children) was published in Zagreb in 1954 by Josip Sabolović, a primary school teacher, and featured contributions by his pupils. The editor-in-chief was Blankica Veselić. The first issue had only four black- and-white pages containing a few essays, drawings and song lyrics made by pupils. Djeca za Djecu soon got very popular so the following issues included contributions by pupils from other Zagreb schools, and eventually, from schools in other cities around the country. As the project grew larger, more adults got involved in it, so the magazine needed a new name. In 1959 a readership poll was held to determine the new name and the winning suggestion was Plava lasta (The Blue Swallow) - but since there was already a newspaper called Plavi vjesnik (The Blue Gazette), it was adapted into Modra lasta (modra and plava being synonymous terms for the color blue in Croatian). It continued to be published throughout the following decades and it achieved huge readership numbers thanks to the independent distribution network (as it is distributed directly in most primary schools), the emphasis on children's contributions, and its colorful and simple coverage of topics that closely follow the school curriculum.  Lastan  Lastan is a fictional boy character that first appeared in Modra lasta in 1969. Initially he had his own column called Sastanak s Lastanom (Meeting Lastan) where he wrote about his hobbies, games, strategies for better learning, etc. At the end of the school year readers would send him their questions and he would answer them in the following issue. His column became an instant hit and turned Lastan into a well-known mascot of the magazine.  Other features =Comic strip anthology= Modra lasta usually has four comics in every issue, usually appearing on the last pages of the magazine. The first comic \\"Vječno proljeće\\" published in Modra lasta was created by editor Stjepko Težak and illustrated by Hortenzije Pavić in 1958. However, claims that first comic published in Modra lasta is his Uskočka osveta (Uskok's revenge), made by Bednjanec but upon scenario of dr Stjepko Težak. Over the years, many other comics appeared in Modra lasta, the most famous ones being Lastan and Osmoškolci created by Ivica Bednjanec. The magazine played a very important role in popularizing comics during the 1990s and is today seen as one of the most important magazines in the history of comics in Croatia. It serialized works of other authors most notably Darko Macan (Borovnica), Goran Sudžuka (Svebor i Plamena), (Zlatka), Andrija Maurović, Julio Radilović, Štef Bartolić (Gluhe Laste), Neugebauer brothers and others. Other sections appearing regularly are Lastoskop (monthly horoscope as told by Lastan), various personality tests, crosswords and famous quotations.

Richardson, also known as Bob Richardson (May 21, 1910, Rochester, Pennsylvania – February 23, 2007, Bellefonte, PennsylvaniaColorado Railroads: CCRM Co-founder Robert W. Richardson Dies at age 96) was an American writer and narrow gauge railway preservationist. Life Robert W. Richardson was born on May 21, 1910, in Rochester, Pennsylvania. He moved with his parents to Akron, Ohio in 1915, and attended high school there. As a teenager, he enjoyed watching and photographing trains in Ohio and Pennsylvania: his photographic archiving of soon-to-vanish railroads began in May 1931 when he borrowed a camera to record a day with the Ohio River & Western Railway near Key, Ohio. Diverted from a college education, he worked for a local hardware concern before starting his own small print shop. The Depression years were especially hard for printers, and his shop closed in 1937. A keen philatelist, he then worked for George Linn as the second editor of Linn's Weekly Stamp News. Fortunately for rail hobbyists and historians, Richardson kept up his interest in railroad operations and history. Journeys to northwestern Pennsylvania during the 1930s and early 1940s took him to the Sheffield and Tionesta Railway, the Tionesta Valley Railway and the Clarion River Railway. Anticipating military service, he quit his job with Linn's. Subsequently learning that he would not be called up for some time, he took a job as an advertising representative for the Seiberling Rubber Company, which required him to travel extensively through the southern states. In the summer of 1941, Richardson and a friend came to Colorado for the first time, making an unforgettable circle tour on the narrow gauge. He became completely enamored of the slim gauge railroads of Colorado. After military service during World War II with the Army Signal Corps in Iran, where he studied the Persian railroads and learned to read Persian, he returned to his job with Seiberling, but made repeated vacation trips touring the Colorado's narrow gauge railroads in 1945, 1946 and 1947, eventually deciding to make his home there. Quitting his job in 1948, Richardson and an Ohio friend pooled their resources to open the Narrow Gauge Motel in Alamosa. The grounds offered a fine place to display some of the narrow gauge equipment he had purchased, along with that saved by the Rocky Mountain Railroad Club. From 1948 to 1958 he sporadically published Narrow Gauge News, a newsletter which later became the Colorado Railroad Museum's Iron Horse News. At Alamosa, Bob Richardson tirelessly railed against the abandonment of the historic narrow gauge lines: his untiring efforts and the publicity he generated were among the primary reasons that the Silverton Train and the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad were preserved for future generations. While in Alamosa, Richardson amassed a formidable collection of railroad artifacts and equipment, including famed D&RGW; locomotive No. 346, which he purchased with his own funds in 1950. Then Cornelius W. Hauck, another prominent railroad enthusiast from Ohio, acquired D&RGW; 2-8-0 No. 318 and placed it at the motel. Bob's friendship with \\"Corny\\" Hauck led to the establishment of the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden. Purchase of the former farm just east of Golden was completed in 1958, and the museum was officially opened to the public in July 1959. Construction of the Iron Horse Motel next door was intended to be an additional source of operating revenue, but instead proved to be overly time-consuming and was sold. Several years down the road, the motel was purchased and razed to make way for the roundhouse restoration facility and to enable completion of a loop of narrow gauge track. Bob served as Executive Director of the Colorado Railroad Museum until 1991, when he decided to retire and move back to join family in Pennsylvania, where he had been raised. The Robert W. Richardson Railroad Library at the museum was created and named in his honor.Robert W. Richardson Railroad Library Richardson wrote for both Trains and Railroad magazines, and throughout his life published books chronicling narrow gauge railroads. It is no exaggeration to say that he did more than any other individual to preserve Colorado's unique railroad heritage. Robert W. Richardson died on February 23, 2007, in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, at the age of 96.

Technically, fontanges are only part of the assembly, referring to the ribbon bows which support the frelange.Mezzotint of Mary II of England in the Victoria & Albert Museum collection The frelange was supported by a wire framework called a commode. A surviving example of a frelange headdress with fontanges and commode in situ is that worn by the 1690s fashion doll Lady Clapham.Lady Clapham's cap in the Victoria & Albert Museum collection In England, the style was popularly known as a 'top-knot', versions of which were worn by ladies of all ranks, from the Queen downwards to kitchen maids, making it an easy target for satire and criticism. The fontange is said to be named for the Duchesse de Fontange, a mistress of King Louis XIV of France. One version of the story is that after losing her cap while hunting with the King, the Marquise tied her hair up using a ribbon in a manner that pleased him, and this was imitated by the other ladies at court, subsequently spreading across Europe.Definition of 'fontange' at marquise.de What started out as a simple headdress of folded ribbon in the 1680s became, with additional fabric, lace and trimmings, taller and more complex, increasingly difficult to create and wear. Despite its courtly origins, fontanges were forbidden to be worn at French state occasions, although the English court accepted them, with Queen Mary having her portrait painted wearing one. The term \\"fontange\\" is also used by some writers to refer to the associated hairstyle or the combination of headdress and hairstyle. The 'fontange coiffure' was a hairstyle where the front of the hair was worn curled and piled high above the forehead in front of the frelange, which was always higher than the hair.

Lean laboratory is a management and organization process derived from the concept of lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System (TPS). The goal of a lean laboratory is to reduce resource usage and costs while improving productivity, staff morale, and laboratory-driven outcomes. Overview Manufacturing companies, including medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, operate in highly regulated environments which often necessitate a great deal of resources, time, and money being expended in the testing, release, and quality assurance of their products. Since the early 1990s, there has been a more widespread drive to adopt more lean approaches both in the manufacturing and testing of products. The advances in lean thinking developed and refined in the automotive industry initially by Toyota (TPS) are now being used as best practices across most manufacturing sectors. The idea of lean laboratory shares its origins with lean manufacturing and uses the same tools to deliver the most efficient and least wasteful processes, tools such as Kaizen, Just In Time (JIT), Heijunka, Kanban, and Six Sigma. The principles of lean manufacturing have been difficult at times to migrate to laboratories because they are quite different from manufacturing environments. In the hospital laboratory, for example, difficulties arise with the \\"staunch adherence to traditional laboratory practices, complexity of workflow, and marked variability in sample numbers.\\" In pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical labs, \\"the limiting belief\\" that procedures are so different that lean won't work often slow down adoption. Compared to manufacturing environments, most analytical and microbiological laboratories have a relatively low volume of samples but a high degree of variability and complexity. Many standard lean tools are not a good fit; however, lean can still be applied to these types of labs. A generic approach is not suitable for laboratories, but careful adaptation of the techniques based on a thorough understanding of lab operations will deliver significant benefits in terms of cost, speed, or both. Conventional laboratories It is a common occurrence for testing laboratories to suffer from long and variable lead times. Some of the problems or issues which can be attributed to conventional or “non lean” laboratories include the following issues. =Lack of focus= Analysts and microbiologists are typically focused on test accuracy and individual test run efficiency. Very often, personnel are dedicated to specific tests and there is little or no control of the progress of individual samples through a sometimes highly variable test routing that can be dependent on product type and/or the intended market. =Long and variable lead times= In many test laboratories, it is normal to find queues in front of each test where individual samples wait until enough similar samples arrive to constitute an \\"efficient test run.\\" This approach causes long and variable lead times and, contrary to popular belief, does not result in higher productivity. =Ineffective \\"fast track\\" systems= To deal with the long lead times, \\"fast track\\" systems are often developed in an effort to deal with urgent samples, but these often become unworkable. Frequently, the proportion of samples designated as priority becomes so large that fast tracking quickly becomes ineffective. =High levels of work in progress= Laboratories often maintain high levels of work in process (WIP), which inevitably results in significant (non value adding) effort being expended in controlling, tracking, and prioritizing samples and in planning analyst work. Companies often respond to this situation by investing in a laboratory information management system (LIMS) or some other IT system. However these systems do not in themselves improve performance. The underlying process by which work is organized and moves through the lab must first be re-engineered based on lean principles. =Volatile incoming workload= For many testing laboratories, the incoming workload is inherently volatile, with significant peaks and dips. This causes low productivity (during dips) and/or poor lead time performance (during peaks). Very often the capacity of the lab is not well understood, and there is no mechanism to level or smooth the workload. Implementing lean in the lab To address the above problems and issues, a lean laboratory uses lean principles to eliminate waste or Muda. There are a number of principles that can be used, but the goal is always primarily focused on improving measurable performance and/or reducing costs. =Specify value= The first step in designing any lean laboratory is to specify value. Every activity in the laboratory is identified and categorizing as \\"value added,\\" \\"non-value added\\" (from the customers perspective), and \\"incidental.\\" Incidental work is non value add in itself but essential to enable value add tasks to be carried out. A significant focus of any lean lab initiative will be to eliminate or reduce the non value add activities. =Identify the value stream= Another key lean step is to develop value stream maps of the overall release process. This should avoid the error of working on point solutions that only end up moving a bottleneck to another process and therefore do not deliver overall improvements. For example, there is no real value in reducing analytical laboratory lead times below the time of a release constraint test in a microbiology lab. You can however use increased velocity to help \\"level the load\\" or to maximize individual test run efficiency. =Make value flow and create pull= A lean laboratory will normally have a defined sequence of tests and associated analyst roles that make good use of people and equipment. A key principle is to flow work through the laboratory so that once testing begins on a sample, it is kept moving and not allowed to queue between tests. This creates a focus and drive to reduce throughput time, which can be converted into a lead-time reduction or used to allow samples to wait in an incoming queue to facilitate level loading and /or grouping for efficiency. \\"Pull\\" is interpreted as testing according to customer priority. If this is not inherent in the order in which samples arrive, then the samples are taken from an incoming queue according to customer demand and thereafter processed in FIFO order with no overtaking. =Level the load and the mix= At its simplest, leveling the load (overall workload) and the mix (the mix of sample types) is about putting the same amount of work into the lab on a daily basis. This is probably the most critical step and potentially the most beneficial for the majority of testing laboratories. Successfully leveling a volatile load and mix will significantly improve productivity and/or lead time. The productivity improvement can be used to provide additional capacity or converted into a cost reduction. =Eliminate waste (muda)= Lean laboratories continuously look to develop solutions and re-engineer processes to eliminate or reduce the non-value added and incidental tasks identified when specifying value. =Manage performance= An essential part of lean in the laboratory is to manage and review a lab's performance daily, ensuring that Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) are good and that the overall laboratory process is in control.

Originally opened by Germany in 1940 as an airbase after the invasion of Poland, after the German capitulation in 1945 the airport was transferred over to Soviet/Polish control. The airbase closed in 2000 as it was deemed unsafe for any further operations, before eventually being overhauled and repurposed as a commercial airport. It is located 40 km (25 miles) north of Warsaw's city centre in Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki and has a maximum capacity of approx. 2-2.3 million passengers a year. The airport is intended to be used by low-cost carriers serving Warsaw, the capital of Poland. As of 2017, the airport is the fifth busiest airport in Poland, with 2,932,639 passengers currently exclusively served by Ryanair, however as of late the airport is slowly opening up to other airlines, such as the local Warsaw-based Enter Air, however for now only operating seasonal services. The main international airport of the city, however, is Warsaw Chopin Airport. History = Earlier usage = The former airbase photographed from the air in December 1961 Originally designed for military use in the Second Polish Republic in 1937, it was not opened by Polish authorities. Instead, it was made operational during World War II in 1940 as an airbase by the German Luftwaffe in occupied Poland. Postwar, between 1945 and 2000 it was used by Polish and Soviet air forces. In 2000 the Polish Ministry of National Defence declared the airfield closed. The airport's runway was in poor condition and lacked proper lighting and modern radio navigation aids such as an Instrument Landing System. = Redevelopment = Subsequently, much of its original area was made available as capital in a joint management limited liability company created to run the future airport, Port Lotniczy Mazowsze Warszawa-Modlin Sp. z o.o. The airport was converted for civilian use, primarily as a replacement for the now closed Etiuda terminal for low-cost carriers at Warsaw's main airport, this idea emerged in the early 2000s. Numerous projected opening dates had slipped, and business plans with extensive infrastructure improvements, including a new passenger terminal, had been proposed without any actual progress in the construction for some time. An environmental assessment was completed as well.Krzysztof Smietana, \\"Z Modlina polecimy dopiero w 2010 roku\\", Gazeta.pl, 21 December 2007. Link accessed 2008-03-06.

On 8 February 2010, the airport was registered officially as a civil airport by the Polish Aviation Authority (Urząd Lotnictwa Cywilnego). In September 2009 it was announced that tenders were being accepted and funding had been secured from the EU for an opening in 2011, in time for the Euro 2012 Football Tournament. Construction works finally began in October 2010 and were expected to be completed before Euro 2012; however the deadline was not met and instead the airport began to operate in July 2012. A new 5 km rail spur branching off from the existing Warsaw–Gdynia line will be built with an underground station at the airport, theoretically providing a 30-minute commute to Warsaw centre. Although the first aircraft was meant to depart Modlin on 16 July 2012, the airport was officially inaugurated the day before, and the first passenger flight from Budapest arrived at the airport around 17:30.

Ryanair confirmed on the day of the runway closure it would divert all aircraft to Warsaw-Chopin Airport until the runway was repaired. Wizz Air also confirmed that it would route its flights to Chopin Airport until Modlin re-opened. The official re-opening took place over six months later on 4 July 2013 after construction works to fix the runway had been completed. On 17 July 2013, Wizz Air announced it would not return to Modlin despite its re-opening, but stay at Warsaw-Chopin Airport instead. Ryanair returned to Modlin on 30 September 2013 and since added more routes to its initial schedule. On 19 September 2013 the Category I Instrument Landing System was officially ready for use. At the same time tests began for the Category II Instrument Landing System which was ready for use by 1 May 2014. In October 2015, the airport welcomed its 5th millionth passenger overall.

Present day The division consists of over 300 officers and ratings, making it the largest in the country. The division draws recruits from the City, as well as further afield. There is also a satellite unit in Chatham, the Medway Division. History There had been a drill ship moored in London since 1 April 1862. This was the 58-gun frigate , berthed at the West India Docks and training ship of the local Royal Naval Reserve. They were joined in 1872 by the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers. This ship was named Old President on 25 March 1903, and was sold for scrapping on 7 July 1903. This ship had been constructed in 1829 on the exact lines of the American 'monster frigate' USS President which was captured by the Royal Navy at the close of the War of 1812, and the name was deliberately retained in memory both of this capture, and also the 1806 capture of the which had served as from 1806 to 1815. The frigate HMS President, built in 1818, was the RNR's London Division drill ship from 1862 to July 1903. All the Old President's successors in the London RNR role have also been renamed HMS President, including , , the HMS Saxifrage, and the present shore training establishment in St Katharine Docks. With the passing of the Naval Forces Act by Parliament on 30 June 1903, the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve was created. The London Division was established on 10 November 1903 and held its first drill night at the Fishmongers' Hall. It then moved to the sloop-of-war then moored in the Thames. The Gannet had been renamed HMS President on 16 May 1903. She served for nine years as the centre's home, until being paid off on 31 March 1911, and is now preserved in Chatham Historic Dockyard. She was replaced by HMS Buzzard, which had been serving as a training ship at Blackfriars since 19 May 1904. She took the name HMS President on 1 April 1911. This President served until 23 January 1918, when she was lent to The Marine Society, finally being sold on 6 September 1921. It was intended to replace her with the sloop , but she was wrecked on her way to being fitted out. She was instead replaced by her sister HMS Saxifrage, which was renamed HMS President on 9 September 1921. She was moored at King's Reach on 19 June 1922. She was joined in 1938 by , which served as a drill hall and gave extra space for activities. HMS President was taken over in 1939 for the training of DEMS gunners and sailors. The Reserve division had been closed by April 1940. The division was reformed in October 1946 and continued to serve as the London base. Later history President took a number of roles and duties, one of which was to serve as the accounting base for Admiralty personnel. The Royal Navy section was transferred to a new section named HMS St Vincent on 15 September 1983. St Vincent was located in a building that had been purchased in 1954 as accommodation for WRNS. It was commissioned as an independent command in 1985 and was paid off on 31 March 1992. In the mid 1980s the was attached to the base. In 1988 both HMS President and HMS Chrysanthemum were sold and the division moved ashore, into a purpose built training centre next to Tower Bridge overlooking St Katharine Docks.

They retained the name President, but adopting a specific identifying numeral after it. They were: =HMS President I= Located both in London and Shrewsbury it was established as an accounting base, in operation between 1918 and 1928. It took over the accounting from the Stornoway based HMS Iolaire, which had closed on 19 May 1919. It was at the Royal Victoria Yard in 1939, and moved to Shrewsbury in September 1940. It returned to London on 6 July 1945, setting up operations at Chelsea Court. It took over some Naval Party accounts from HMS Odyssey when that office closed on 31 January 1946. The department remained operational between 1947 and 1957, seeing the merging into it of HMS President III and HMS Pembroke III. =HMS President II= This was another accounting base, based at times at Chatham, Crystal Palace, Chingford and Shrewsbury, and extant between 1916 and at least 1947. Also at Felixstowe in 1917. (Possibly also at Calshot and Bembridge during 1917.) =HMS President III= A third accounting base, this time alternately based at Bristol, Windsor and London. It covered the accounts of the active services of the Royal Fleet Reserve, the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and the Royal Naval Reserve from 1916 onwards, also extending to covering demobilisation accounts from December 1918 onwards. The Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship accounts were transferred to HMS Vivid on 1 October 1919. In August 1935, President III also took over the accounts of the Mobile Naval Defence Base Organisation. It was re-established on 28 August 1939 in Bristol to train those allocated for service on the Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships. It was later transferred to locations across Windsor and London. By 31 May 1944 the command held over 30,500 accounts. The ledgers were closed after the war on 1 July 1946, and the accounts covered by President III and Pembroke III were merged into President I. =HMS President IV= This was the London accounting base, in operation between 1918 and 1926, handling the accounts of the commands of the Coastguard ships and the Reserves. =HMS President V= Another London accounting base, initially set up in 1918 it covered a wide variety of accounts but was paid off on 30 September 1919 and the accounts were transferred to HMS Pembroke.

William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford (17 March 1722 – 10 March 1791), styled Viscount Wentworth until 1739 was a peer and member of the House of Lords of Great Britain. Ancestry and career Strafford was the only son of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672-1739). His paternal great-grandfather was Sir William Wentworth of Ashby Puerorum, a younger brother of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford of the earlier creation. His father was a cousin of William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford, who died childless, on whose death in 1695 he became the 3rd Baron Raby. However, the Strafford fortune, with the estate of the great Jacobean house of Wentworth Woodhouse, went to a nephew of the second Earl's. His mother was Anne Johnson, daughter of the wealthy politician and shipowner Sir Henry Johnson and his first wife Anne Smithson. Although his mother brought his father a fortune, it was generally agreed to be a very happy marriage. The title of Earl of Strafford was created for the third time in 1711, for Strafford's father, and thus came to him on his father's death in 1739. He was also 2nd Duke of Strafford in the Jacobite Peerage. He played less of a political role than his father, although he was granted a farm of the post fines on 25 March 1756 and was appointed a deputy lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire on 4 August 1757.

The two became part of a social set which included Horace Walpole, who considered the countess to be a \\"vast beauty\\" and immortalised her in a poem which was published in 1765.

The principle was developed by the European Court of Justice, which interpreted that norms of European law take precedence over any norms of national law, including the constitutions of member states. Although national courts generally accept the principle in practice, most of them disagree with that extreme interpretation and reserve, in principle, the right to review the constitutionality of European law under national constitutional law. For the European Court of Justice, national courts and public officials must disapply a national norm that is believed not to be compliant with the EU law. Disapplying is different by the European Parliament's legislation in that it concerns to a specific case, and legislation is universal and equivalent for all people. However, disapplication of the national law in a judicial case or administrative procedure can create a legal precedent that is repeated over the time by the same or other courts and so becomes part of the national jurisprudence. The United Kingdom claimed that statement to be contrary to the fundamental principle of the separation of powers into the national jurisdictions since it provides to unelected courts or other nonjurisdictional charges the power to ignore the role of Parliament with a de facto immunity from law enforcement. Some countries provide that if national and EU law contradict, courts and public officials are required to suspend the application of the national law, ask to the national constitutional court and wait until its decision is taken. If the norm has been declared to be constitutional, they are automatically obliged to apply the national law. That fact can theorically create a contradiction between the national constitutional court and the European Court of Justice. It can also originate from a contradiction between two primary sources in the hierarchy of the sources of law: the national constitutions and European law. Development In Costa v. ENEL.Case 6/64, Costa v. ENEL [1964] ECR 585, 593 Mr Costa was an Italian citizen opposed to the nationalisation of energy companies. Because he had shares in a private corporation subsumed by the nationalised company, ENEL, he refused to pay his electricity bill in protest. In the subsequent suit brought to Italian courts by ENEL, he argued that nationalisation infringed EC law on the state distorting the market.now found in Art. 86 and Art. 87 The Italian government believed that not to be an issue that even could be complained about by a private individual since it was a decision to make by a national law. The ECJ ruled in favour of the government because the relevant treaty rule on an undistorted market was one on which the Commission alone could challenge the Italian government. As an individual, Mr Costa had no standing to challenge the decision, because that treaty provision had no direct effect.\\"But this obligation does not give individuals the right to allege, within the framework of community law... either failure by the state concerned to fulfil any of its obligations or breach of duty on the part of the commission.\\" But on the logically prior issue of Mr Costa's ability to raise a point of EC law against a national government in legal proceeding before the courts in that member state the ECJ disagreed with the Italian government. It ruled that EC law would not be effective if Mr Costa could not challenge national law on the basis of its alleged incompatibility with EC law. > It follows from all these observations that the law stemming from the > treaty, an independent source of law, could not, because of its special and > original nature, be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed, > without being deprived of its character as community law and without the > legal basis of the community itself being called into question.Case 6/64, > Flaminio Costa v. ENEL [1964] ECR 585, 593 In other cases, countries write the precedence of EU law into their constitutions. For example, the Constitution of Ireland contains this clause: \\"No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union or of the Communities\\". *C-106/77, Simmenthal [1978] ECR 629, duty to set aside provisions of national law that are incompatible with Union law. *C-106/89 Marleasing [1991] ECR I-7321, national law must be interpreted and applied, if possible, to avoid a conflict with a Community rule. Article I-6 of the European Constitution stated: \\"The Constitution and law adopted by the institutions of the Union in exercising competences conferred on it shall have primacy over the law of the Member States\\". Although constitution was never ratified, its replacement, the Treaty of Lisbon, included the following declaration on primacy: Particular countries Depending on the constitutional tradition of member states, different solutions have been developed to adapt questions of incompatibility between national law and EU law to one another. EU law is accepted as having supremacy over the law of member states, but not all member states share the ECJ's analysis on why EU law takes precedence over national law if there is a conflict. =Belgium= In its ruling of 22 May 1971, nicknamed \\"het Smeerkaasarrest\\" (Dutch: \\"the cheese spread ruling\\"), the Belgian Court of Cassation ruled that self-executing treaties prevail over national law, including the Belgian constitution. Thus, EU regulations prevail over national law. EU directives do not prevail unless they are converted to national law. =Czech Republic= Article 10 of the Constitution of the Czech Republic states that every international treaty ratified by the Parliament of the Czech Republic is part of the Czech legislative order and takes precedence over all other laws. =France= Like many other countries within the civil law legal tradition, France's judicial system is divided between ordinary and administrative courts. The ordinary courts accepted the supremacy of EU law in 1975, but the administrative courts accepted the doctrine only in 1990. The supreme administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, had held that as the administrative courts had no power of judicial review over legislation enacted by the French Parliament, they could not find that national legislation was incompatible with European law or give it precedence over a conflicting national law. That was in contrast to the supreme ordinary court, the Cour de cassation; in the case of Administration des Douanes v Société 'Cafes Jacques Vabre' et SARL Wiegel et Cie,[1975] 2 CMLR 336. it ruled that precedence should be given to European law over national law in line with the requirements of the Article 55 of the French Constitution, which accorded supremacy to ratified international treaty over national law. The administrative courts finally changed their position in the case of Raoul Georges Nicolo[1990] 1 CMLR 173. by deciding to follow the reasoning used by the Cour de cassation. However, both ordinary courts and administrative courts still reject the primacy of EU law over the French constitution. =Germany= In Solange II,Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft, BVerfG decision of 22 October 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265). the German Constitutional Court held that so long as () EU law had a level of protection of fundamental rights that is substantially in concurrence with the protections afforded by the German constitution, it would no longer review specific EU acts in light of that constitution. =Ireland= The Third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland explicitly provided for the supremacy of EU law in the Republic of Ireland by providing that no other provision of the Irish constitution could invalidate laws enacted if they were necessitated by membership of the European Communities. In Crotty v. An Taoiseach, the Irish Supreme Court held that the ratification of the Single European Act by the Republic of Ireland was not necessitated by membership of the European Communities and so could be subject to review by the courts. =Italy= In Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze,[1974] 2 CMLR 372. the plaintiff sought to have a national law disregarded without having to wait for the Italian Constitutional Court do so. The ECJ ruled that every national court must apply European law in its entirety. =Lithuania= The Lithuanian Constitutional Court concluded on 14 March 2006 in case no. 17/02-24/02-06/03-22/04, § 9.4 in Chapter III, that EU law has supremacy over ordinary legal acts of the Lithuanian Parliament but not over the Lithuanian constitution. If the Constitutional Court finds EU law to be contrary to the constitution, the former law loses its direct effect and shall remain inapplicable. =Malta= Article 65 of the Maltese constitution provides that all laws made by Parliament must be consistent with EU law and Malta's obligations deriving from its Treaty of Accession.Constitution of Malta =Poland= The Constitutional Tribunal of Poland ruled that while EU law may override national statutes, it does not override the Polish constitution. In a conflict between EU law and the constitution, Poland can make a sovereign decision as to how this conflict should be resolved (by changing the constitution, leaving the EU or seeking to change the EU law).\\"Verdict of the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland of May 11th, 2005\\"; K 18/04 Former Members =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union and its predecessor the European Communities from 1 January 1973 until 31 January 2020. During this time the issue of EU law taking precedence over national law was a significant issue and a cause for debate both among politicians and even in the judiciary. In R v Secretary of State for Transport, ex p Factortame Ltd, the House of Lords ruled that courts in the United Kingdom had the power to \\"disapply\\" acts of parliament if they conflicted with EU law. Lord Bridge held that Parliament had voluntarily accepted this limitation of its sovereignty and was fully aware that even if the limitation of sovereignty was not inherent in the Treaty of Rome, it had been well established by jurisprudence before Parliament passed the European Communities Act 1972.Lord Bridge, 1991, Appeal Cases 603, 658; quoted in In 2011 the UK Government, as part of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement following the 2010 UK general election, passed the European Union Act 2011 in a attempt to address the issue by inserting a sovereignty clause.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, \\"EU Bill to include Parliamentary sovereignty clause\\" (London, 6 October 2010) The clause was enacted in section 18 which says: However, in the 2014 case of R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom said:[2014] UKSC 3 at [207], per Lords Neuberger and Mance At 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET in Brussels) on 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom became the first member state to formally leave the European Union after 47 years of membership under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. At the same time, the European Communities Act 1972 (ECA 1972), the piece of legislation that incorporated EU law (Community law as it was in 1972) into the domestic law of the United Kingdom, was repealed by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, although the effect of the 1972 Act was saved by the provisions of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 to enable EU law to continue to have legal effect within the UK until the end of the implementation period, which is expected to be 31 December 2020.

Sweet citron The Moroccan citron was described by the Moroccan professor Henri Chapot, as being a sweet citron, meaning that its pulp is low in acid. He discovered that the acidity in the more common citrons or lemons, is represented by red on the inner coat of seeds specifically on the chalazal spot, violet pigmentation on the outer side of the flower blossom, and also by the new buds that are reddish-purplish. The Moroccan citron which is acidless is completely lacking the red color. This designation was cited by Herbert John Webber and Leon Dexter Batchelor the editors of the fundamental treatise on citrus, namely The Citrus Industry, which was published by the University of California, Riverside in 1967.Available online at The Citrus Industry , see title \\"Sugar or Acidless Oranges\\" Chapot was probably first to describe this variety of citron in detail, along with illustrations of many forms of the fruit, and all the properties of the shrub, leaves and blossoms. He also mentions that the true citron of Morocco, which is traditionally only grown in the region of Assads, for the sake of the mitzva of four species, and is oblong, acidless and rather dry, is much different than the rounded citron hybrid, Rhobs el Arsa, that is more commonly grown for food in the entire country of Morocco, and its taste is acidic and fruity.Un curieux cedrat Marocain (1950) Rev. Intl. Bot. Appl. Agr. Trop. 30:506–514. The only other known sweet citron is the Corsican. Use as etrog The exact date when the variety came into use for etrog is unknown. According to the local Jewry, it was with them since they were exiled to Morocco after the destruction of the Second Temple. From then on it was highly revered by all the rabbis and communities of North Africa, without any interruption or controversy.Website from North African Rabbi * Yeshiva Net Episode of Baba Sali witnessed by Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu. During time, it got accepted also by Ashkenazi communities all over Europe.HaLevanon 11 no 7 , page 2, Rabbi Yakov Ettlinger about Moroccan Etrog. * HaLevanon 13, no 3 Nathan Adler, rabbi of London, and Yakov Sapir about Moroccan etrogs in 1876 - go right away to page 5 Berbers at their etrog plantations =Location of cultivation= The precise location of cultivation is at the village Assads in the Taroudant Province, and a 100 km east of Agadir, as was numerously reported by rabbinical and secular sources. =Graft free= Grafted citrons are not kosher for ritual use on the biblical Jewish holiday Sukkot, according to Jewish religious laws, (halakha),Aruch Hashulchan 648;27 *Yeshiva.org and some prefer to search for etrog citrons none of whose ancestors had been grafted.Ethrog page on Citrus Variety Collection website *Search Authentic Citron In 1995, professor Eliezer E. Goldschmidt together with a delegation of rabbis were hired by rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv of Jerusalem, Israel, to check out if Morocco is still in the same state of kashrut, and if any grafted etrog is to be found over there. Goldschmidt asked the Moroccan professor of horticulture, namely Mohamed El- Otmani from Agadir, to assist. Berber peasants climbing up the steep mountain at the way to their orchards. All together they climbed up the Anti-Atlas canyon where the local Berbers have been cultivating the Moroccan citron for many centuries, and they were very impressed from the old tradition which is practiced there, finding not one grafted citron tree. The delegation presented their finding to Eliashiv, who was very happy about the information that the Moroccan wilderness still presents the unbroken lineage, of a non-grafted etrog. =The lack of seeds= However, in 1960, Schraga Schlomai, a renowned etrog growerwho republished the \\"Pri Etz Hadar\\" booklet that was originally authored by the Salant partners in 1962, see his introduction with the name \\"Davar el haKorei\\" recounted the misfortunes of all the used etrog types besides the one he was growing, which he claimed to be a descendant of the Balady citron from Umm al-Fahm. As to the Diamante citron (Yanova) and the Greek citron (Corfu), he argued based on the booklet from the Salant partners, that since some of them are proven to be grafted, no certification may be granted to the rest, since it is impossible to determine if the non-grafted citrons are not descendants of the grafted ones. A halved seedless Moroccan citron (Etrog) As to the Moroccan and Yemenite citrons he argued, that although there were no grafted trees ever discovered among those kinds, they should be unfit, in light of the differentiation from the Ashkenazi types. The Moroccan citron is allegedly noted for its seedlessness, and the Yemenite for its pulplessness, both are too much different in morphology from the traditional Yanova and Israeli esrogs.דבר אל הקורא, שרגא שלומאי, תשכ\\"ב He was then disputed by Rabbi Shmuel David Munk in his responsa \\"Pe'ath Sadcha\\" (chapter 62), that at least with those who are surely ungrafted, the differentials cannot regret them, since the etrog of one country must not match the morphology of that of another origin. A Moroccan citron with vertically pointing seeds In 1980, when the market in New York City changed very much in favor of the Moroccan citron, Rabbi Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam, the Klausenberger Rebbe, reconsolidated the claims of Schraga Schlomai and carried out a banning of the Moroccan for religious use.Letters of Shefa Chaim, Vol. 1 No. 34 His ruling was based on the fact that some of them have no seeds, and seeing that the Shiyurei Kneseth haGedola (Orach Chaim 648) discuses what direction the seeds should be facing to prove their purity, he concluded that an authentic citron should always be seedy. The seeds of the Moroccan citron when present, are actually facing utmost vertically as required, and the partial seedlessness cannot be a result of graft, as the trees were already checked various times, as being completely free of any grafting. =Genetic purity= As to natural hybridization that may have occurred to certain types of citron, and should result in genetic and morphological changes, it is very unlikely in light of the DNA comparison conducted by Elizabetta Nicolosi from University of Catania, Italy and a group of researchers from around the globe, where it was found to be completely pure citron and extremely similar to the rest of kosher etrogs.

(1888). Ancien Japon, p. 67. Inaba clan genealogy The fudai Inaba clan originated in Mino Province. They claim descent from Kōno Michitaka (d. 1374), who claimed descent from Emperor Kanmu (736–805).\\"Inaba\\" at Ancestry.com citing Hank, Patrick, ed. (2003). Dictionary of American Family Names. Masanobu was part of the cadet branch of the Inaba which was created in 1588. This branch is descended from Inaba Masanari (d. 1628), who fought in the armies of Nobunaga and then Hideyoshi. In 1619, Masanari was granted the han of Itoigawa (25,000 koku) in Echigo Province; then, in 1627, his holding was transferred to Mōka Domain (65,000 koku) in Shimotsuke Province. Masanari's descendants resided successively at Odawara Domain (105,000 koku) in Sagami Province from 1632 through 1685; at Takata Domain in Echigo Province from 1685 through 1701; at Sakura Domain in Shimōsa Province from 1701 through 1723. Masanobu's heirs and others who were also descendants of Inaba Masanari settled at Yodo Domain (115,000 koku) in Yamashiro Province from 1723 through 1868. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. Tokugawa official Masanobu was the Tokugawa shogunate's Kyoto shoshidai in the period spanning March 4, 1804 through October 5, 1806. Notes References * Appert, Georges and H. Kinoshita. (1888).

History Red Army was founded in 1981 in Mostar under the name Crveni šejtani (Red Devils), after FK Velež Mostar won its first Yugoslav Cup final. The final game was won with a score of 3-2 against FK Željezničar at the Marakana stadium in front of more than 40,000 people. Following its inception, Crveni šejtani fell into a period of decline, but resurfaced again in 1986, when FK Velež once again reached the final of the Yugoslav Cup versus Dinamo Zagreb. The game was won by Velež with a final score of 3-1. After that game, Crveni šejtani were renamed to Red Army. During that period, subgroups formed, including the Zealots, Eagles, Chicago, Furia, Carina and others. The group of FK Velež fans in Sarajevo was called Red Platoon. During the Yugoslavia period, FK Velež was considered the pride of Herzegovina and was supported by all Herzegovinians. The fan base spanned Yugoslavia, with the most support coming from Konjic, Čapljina, Travnik, Doboj, Tuzla and Dubrovnik. During the 1985–86 season, Mostar was a town of 110,000 people. However, eight-thousand Red Army members traveled to Split to watch a Hajduk- Velež match. This is just one of the many examples of the love that Red Army had for Velež. Velež was viewed as a multi-ethnic team. Many Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs played in FK Velež. With the collapse of Yugoslavia, Velež collapsed as well. Today, members of the Red Army are mostly Bosniaks. A few Serbs and Croats are still involved. While Bosnians are a majority, the group accept all nationalities. Attendance at the stadium rarely reached levels seen in the 1980s, but during certain occasions large numbers of fans still gather. Present day Today, Red Army Mostar is mostly composed of people from Mostar. A few groups come from Ilidža, Konjic, Jablanica, Čapljina and Stolac. Red Army's biggest rivals today are Ultras Mostar, a supporter group of another team from Mostar HŠK Zrinjski Mostar. The rivalry is based both on locality and ethnicity. FK Velež and Red Army are predominantly Bosniaks, while Zrinjski and Ultras are Croats. The rivalry began after the end of the Bosnian War, mostly because of conflict between Bosniaks and Croats during the war. The city of Mostar was divided between the east side, which is predominantly Bosniak, and the west side, which is predominantly Croat. Velež's old stadium, Bijeli Brijeg Stadium remained in the west side of Mostar, so the club had to find a new stadium to be able to play matches. Its old stadium was given to Zrinjski. Matches between Velež and Zrinjski are often afflicted with high levels of conflict. Songs The official anthem of the Red Army Mostar is Ili grmi il' se zemlja trese by MO Selection Band. Later, a band called Red Army Band recorded seven songs that quickly became popular among Velež fans. Other artists did the same too, so today there are a lot of recorded songs about the red club from Mostar.

The screenplay by Frederic Raphael is based on the 1878 novella of the same title by Henry James. The lavish period costumes and sets were done by Ferdinando Scarfiotti, Mariolina Bono and John Furniss.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071385/fullcredits Bogdanovich later said he wished he had not made the film, claiming \\"It's a good picture, there's nothing wrong with it\\", but said \\"I knew when we were making it that it wasn't commercial\\" and \\"if I had been smart about things... I would not have done something so completely uncommercial.\\" He says the film's financial failure \\"threw the studio's confidence in me, that I would do a picture like that instead of thinking only in terms of box office\\" and \\"helped f*ck up the next two pictures... they came out not the way I wanted.\\" Plot synopsis The title character is a beautiful, flirtatious, nouveau riche young American visiting a Swiss spa with her nervously timid, talkative mother and spoiled, xenophobic younger brother Randolph. There she meets upper class expatriate American Frederick Winterbourne, who is warned about her reckless ways with men by his dowager aunt Mrs. Costello. When the two are reunited in Rome, Winterbourne tries to convince Daisy her keeping company with suave Italian Mr. Giovanelli, who has no status among the locals, will destroy her reputation with the expatriates, including socialite Mrs. Walker, who is offended by her behavior and vocal about her disapproval. Daisy is too carelessly naive to take either of them seriously. Winterbourne is torn between his feelings for Daisy and his respect for social customs, and he is unable to tell how she really feels about him beneath her facade of willful abandon. When he meets her and Giovanelli in the Colosseum one night, he decides such behavior makes him unable to love her and lets her know it. Winterbourne warns her against the malaria, against which she has failed to take precautions. She becomes ill, and dies a few days later. At her funeral, Giovanelli tells Winterbourne that she was the most \\"innocent\\". Winterbourne wonders whether his ignorance of American customs may have contributed to her fate.

This company was the idea of Charles Bludhorn, chairman of Gulf and Western, who owned Paramount at the time. Peter Bart, then working at Paramount, remembers: > Bogdanovich called me soon after completing Paper Moon to tell me he was > going to introduce me to a filmmaker whose work the company should next > foster. He appeared a day later in the presence of Orson Welles, corpulent > and glowering, who, at the time, was neither young nor promising... > Bogdanovich felt Welles had one more Citizen Kane in him; the other > directors disagreed, as did I.

We had promised Bludhorn \\"commercial\\" films.\\"William Friedkin, The Friedkin Connection: A Memoir, Harper Collins 2013 p 318 However Bogdanovich went ahead anyway. Friedkin later said he was encouraged to do this by Frank Yablans of Paramount, who never liked the idea of the Directors Company and wanted it to fail. Bogdanovich later recalled: > I thought that it would not be a very commercial picture, but I thought we'd > made three in a row; what's wrong with making one that wasn't so commercial? > This is not a good way to think.

Production took place on location in Rome and Vevey in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. Larry McMurtry's son had a support role. During the shoot Rex Reed visited the set and wrote a hostile piece on the director and star. Bogdanovich said later, \\"I remember watching dailies of Daisy Miller in Rome or Switzerland and thinking to myself, saying out loud, \\"This is beautiful, but I don't know who's going to want to see it.\\" And boy, was I right. Don't forget, this was before the Merchant Ivory (Merchant Ivory Productions).\\" Bogdanovich later recalls his partners at the Directors Company were not happy with the film: > They thought it was a kind of a vanity production to show Cybill off.

Frederic Raphael's adaptation of the Henry James story doesn't play. The period production by Peter Bogdanovich is handsome. But his direction and concept seem uncertain and fumbled. Supporting performances by Mildred Natwick, Eileen Brennan and Cloris Leachman are, respectively, excellent, outstanding, and good.\\"Variety review The New York Times said the movie \\"works amazingly well.\\" It congratulated Shepherd for [catching] \\"the gaiety and the directness of Daisy, the spontaneity of a spoiled but very likable person. She also manages to be thoughtless without playing dumb or dizzy, and to convey that mixture of recklessness and innocence that bewildered the other Jamesian characters.\\" Bogdanovich was praised for providing \\"a sensitive glimpse of the hypocrisies and contradictions of the past—without one whiff of nostalgia.\\"New York Times review (Vincent Canby later named it one of the 11 best films of the year.) TV Guide rates it one out of a possible four stars and calls it \\"truly a dud in spite of handsome sets and an intelligent writing job. James is, to say the least, hard to adapt for the screen, but this job becomes hopeless because of Shepherd's shallow performance.\\"TV Guide review Time Out London wrote \\"Bogdanovich's nervous essay in the troubled waters of Henry James, where American innocence and naiveté are in perpetual conflict with European decadence and charm, reveals him to be less an interpreter of James than a translator of him into the brusquer world of Howard Hawks. The violence done James in this is forgivable—indeed, Cybill Shepherd's transformation of Daisy into a Hawks heroine is strangely successful—but as a result there is no real social conflict in the film, and it becomes just a period variant on The Last Picture Show, without the vigour of that film or the irony of the original James novel.\\"Time Out London review The original edition of The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made, published in 1999, included the film,The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made at ListOfBests.com but the second edition published in 2004 deleted it from its list.The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made at NewYorkTimes.com Daisy Miller currently holds a 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/daisy_miller/ Quentin Tarantino later said \\"the film starts off a little bizarre. The tone at the beginning is a little off putting. You’re not quite sure if it works. But the film gains power as it progresses, and builds to a gut punch ending... [the film] is very funny, yet it leaves the viewer remarkably sad as you watch the final credits fade up... The movie plays like the entertaining and breezy classic adaptations that came out of Hollywood in the thirties and forties,... Peter tackles the material in a similar way that you can imagine Howard Hawks dealing with the assignment in the forties.\\" Awards and nominations The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design but lost to The Great Gatsby.

The game is digitally distributed and is available from Big Fish Games. A demo of the game was also released. Both the demo and the full version include a Daily Challenge option where players can play up to three limited edition courses, and trophies and Golf Bucks are awarded for participants in the Daily Challenges.  Gameplay  Inspired by Caddyshack, Fairway Solitaire presents players with a modified type of solitaire with a golf theme. In the game, players use golf clubs and playing cards to clear the table. The goal in Fairway Solitaire is to play through a collection of 70 courses with each course offering a different type of challenge. Once the challenge is met, the next course is unlocked and the player advances in the tournament. Players may be awarded trophies for accomplishing various tasks. Often they are rewarded along with in-game cash or prizes. In addition to the main tournament, daily challenges are available for players to win trophies. Players' scores are recorded and ranked against all other players on the same platform. Additionally, statistics are kept for each player and trophies are awarded for predefined achievements. Adding to the challenge of the game is a gopher, known as Gutsy McDivot, who will stop at nothing to get revenge on the golfers who killed his ancestor, Bravetooth. As the player progresses, cutscenes are shown of McDivot making a contraption he dubs the \\"Golfinator\\". Each Fairway Solitaire course offers water hazards and sand traps. Water hazards are special water cards which must be cleared from the board before the cards to its right are revealed. Sand traps are sand cards which are not revealed until the 'sand wedge' card is uncovered. Occasionally, a player will reveal an iron card. Iron cards have a specific golf club on them and act as magic playing cards without breaking the current drive. A person may play a club at any time to continue adding to a long drive. The clubs are restricted to the 2-9 irons. During Fairway Solitaire game play, wild cards are randomly revealed. One may choose to randomly select an event or pay to skip the risk. The cost to skip is either two cards or $300. These wild cards offer varying opportunities and challenges. The Fairway Solitaire Club House has a golf shop wherein players can purchase equipment to help them during tournament play. The equipment assists the player during actual game play or during wild card play. Items may vary depending on gender. Handicaps which improve a player's performance on a course can be purchased in the shop with Golf bucks, an in-game currency that is earned through gameplay. Golf bucks can also be used to purchase additional courses for the game. Fairway Solitaire Blast has a similar base mechanic to the original Fairway Solitaire iOS game; however, the game's scoring is based on traditional solitaire. The developers say it is, \\"The arcade version of the original Fairway Solitaire game... faster and less complex.\\" There is a map where a player progresses from one course to the next. Each course has 18 levels and each level has three \\"holes\\". You must use 30 cards or less to completely clear the cards from the table in all three holes of each level. The player must also successfully complete the objectives within the three holes of the level or they will fail to progress to the next level. You can earn between one and three stars on each level. In the first two courses, a player learns all of the available \\"power-ups\\". A power-up card is a wild card that can help to either clear the table of cards, prolong a run, or achieve the level objective. Power-up cards randomly appear from the draw pile and are also available for purchase with hard currency.  Development  Originally designed by John Cutter, Glen DeBiasa, Matt Laverty, and Jake Birkett of Big Fish Games, Fairway Solitaire was built in the Java programming environment and published by Big Fish Games. Since the original web game, several iterations have been released by Big Fish Studios. The mobile versions of the game were developed entirely by Big Fish Studios in Seattle, WA. Fairway Solitaire is playable on Windows 8, Windows Phone, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Android, Kindle Fire, Mac, and PC. In April 2014, the Fairway franchise expanded to include Fairway Solitaire Blast. The development team at Big Fish Studios often uses Fairway Solitaire to celebrate important global events, such as the World Cup as well as special occasions in lives of the team members. For instance, when one of the members got married, the Daily Challenges were all wedding-themed. When another member had a baby, the Daily Challenges were baby-themed. They've frequently honored their players in the game by including their names in background art and naming Daily Courses after them. The player community is very positive and appreciative; reflecting the attitude that the developers have shown them.  Legacy  In 2011, Big Fish Games released Fairway, the sequel to Fairway Solitaire as well as Fairway Fever, a version of the game designed to be played on Facebook. Fairway Fever was pulled from Facebook and moved back to development at Big Fish Studios. The Studio released a redesigned version on iOS in November 2012 in Canada. According to their Facebook page, the Canadian release was a test for a worldwide launch. The Fairway team decided to not release its sequel, Fairway Fever, worldwide. It is unknown why this project didn't get a global release. In April 2014, Big Fish Games launched Fairway Solitaire Blast worldwide on iOS via the App Store and Android via Google Play and Amazon for Kindle. It was very well received and achieved Apple Editor Choice featuring. Shortly after launch, Fairway Solitaire Blast was exhibited at PAX East.

It operates Rockwell B-1 Lancer aircraft providing strategic bombing capability. Overview The 34th Bomb Squadron is presently the 4th-oldest active squadron in the United States Air Force, being formed on 10 May 1917, less than a month after the United States' entry into World War I. Members of the squadron participated in World War I, World War II, Korean War, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, the 34th Bomb Squadron stands ready to provide combat-ready aircrews to project global power anytime in support of the Combatant Commander's objectives. History =World War I= The 34th Bomb Squadron can trace its origins to the organization of 2d Company H, Kelly Field, Texas which was organized on 10 May 1917. At the time Kelly Field consisted mostly of a field of cotton plants, as it was just obtained by the Army for the establishment of a training airfield, just to the south of San Antonio, Texas. When the first soldiers arrived, there were not any tents or cots for them so they slept on the ground. When the first tents arrived, they were assigned locations for them and they were pitched. A few days later, when the Company received its full quota of men, it was changed to 1st Company G, Kelly Field. The men received their indoctrination into the Army as soldiers, standing guard duty and other rudimentary duties. The lack of sanitary facilities and also uniforms meant most men worked in the civilian clothing they arrived in and slept in them without bathing until latrines and washing facilities were constructed. The men dug ditches for water mains, erected wooden buildings for barracks and a large YMCA.Gorrell, Series E, Volume 7, History of the 30th–37th Aero Squadrons.Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the World War Across the Atlantic On 15 July, the unit was redesignated as the 34th Provisional Squadron, and rumors began to circulate that the unit would be sent to Europe. On the 25th, it was again re-designated as the 34th Aero Squadron, and they were issued proper uniforms and began to be equipped for overseas duty. On 10 August, the squadron received orders to leave Kelly Field for transport to Hoboken, New Jersey the next day. Five days later, the squadron arrived at Fort Totten, New York. On the 22d they were transported to the Port of Entry, Hoboken, and were boarded on the RMS Baltic. The next day, they left Pier 59, en route to Halifax, Nova Scotia where the ship anchored awaiting for a convoy. Finally, on 5 September, the convoy was formed and the trans-Atlantic journey began. On the night of 14 September, two red rockets were fired from an accompanying destroyer that had spotted a submarine periscope. The destroyer dropped depth charges on the submarine, and the Baltic made a sudden turn to port, that caused both men and anything loose aboard the ship to move. Suddenly a large explosion was heard and five long blasts were made by the ship's whistle and everyone on board was ordered to report to their assigned lifeboats. The Baltic's captain announced that a torpedo had struck the ship, but it had only made a glancing blow on the bow; that the emergency pumps were working and there was no danger. Training in England Edward Sloan, assigned to the 34th Aero Squadron, in training with the Royal Flying Corps, Halton Camp, Wendover, England, September 1917 The next day the Baltic arrived at Liverpool, England where the squadron boarded a train for Southampton, arriving on 16 September. There, the squadron received orders that it would remain in England for training by the Royal Flying Corps. On the 20th the men (about 200 in all), were divided into groups and sent to schools to take training in the different types of work they would be expected to do. 75 men were sent to the machine-gun school in Grantham; the remainder sere sent to schools in Reading, Upaven Station, Wendover, Farnsborough, Halton, Pemlice and other RFC Stations. The 34th Aero Squadron was the first American unit to completely train in England. 2d Aviation Instructional Center After the detachments received their training, the squadron was re- assembled at Winchester for a final inspection. On 18 December, the squadron departed for France, arriving at the port of Le Havre on the 20th. After a few days wait in a \\"Rest Camp\\", they boarded a troop train for the city of Tours, arriving on the 23d. From there, the squadron marched to the American Second Aviation Instructional Center (2d AIC), at Tours Aerodrome, their assigned duty station in France on 23 December 1917. Men of the 34th Aero Squadron, 2d Air Instructional Center, Tours Aerodrome, France, November 1917. (Several Salmson 2A2 reconnaissance aircraft are parked behind the formation) The 2d AIC was established by the Training Section, AEF to train aerial observers and observation pilots. The observer also manned two Lewis Machine Guns for defense. Several squadron members, who had been trained by the RFC in machine guns, started a machine gun school at the base. Other men were engaged in construction activities, putting up aircraft hangars and wooden buildings for all manner of uses from training classes to barracks. Men were assigned as mechanics to airplanes arriving at Tours, and others were used as instructors for the various classes that were organized at the base. In February, there was a general reorganization of the 2d AIC and about half the men of the 34th were transferred to other squadrons, and new men were transferred into the 34th. Many promotions were given to the senior members of the squadron who had arrived the previous December. Training was given to many members of the Corps Observation squadrons of the First Army Air Service as they arrived in France; and beginning in August 1918, new pilots and observers for the planned Second Army Air Service began to arrive for training. By the time of the Armistice on 11 November, the men of the 34th Aero Squadron held about 75% of the responsible positions at the 2d AIC. Although they did not enter combat, the men trained the men who went to the front and gave them the best of training so they might accomplish their work. Demobilization The AEF was notoriously slow in returning men to the United States after the end of hostilities, and men who served on the front had priority over those who served in the rear areas. The 34th, therefore, remained at Tours until May 1919 when orders were received to proceed to the 1st Air Depot, Colombey-les- Belles Airdrome, France, for demobilization. From Colombey, the squadron was moved to a staging camp under the Services of Supply waiting for a date to report to a base port for transportation home. In mid-May, the squadron boarded a troop ship, arriving in New York on the 27th. From there, the 34th moved to Mitchel Field, New York where the men were demobilized and returned to civilian life.Gorrell, Series D, Weekly Statistical Reports of Air Service Activities, October 1918 – May 1919. =Inter-war years= 34h Pursuit Squadron Boeing P-12s at March Field, about 1932. On 24 March 1923, the World War I 34th Aero Squadron was reconstituted into the permanent United States Army Air Service as the 34th Pursuit Squadron. The Army allotted the unit to the Sixth Corps Area, but it remained inactive, although nominally assigned to the inactive 8th Pursuit Group. Until 1927, its designated Active Associate Unit was the 27th Pursuit Squadron. In 1927 its allotted Corps Area became the IX Corps Area, and in 1928, the VIII Corps Area. In 1929, it became a Regular Army Inactive unit, remaining inactive, but with reserve officers assigned. These officers participated in summer training exercises at Kelly Field between 1929 and 1931. The 34th Pursuit Squadron was finally activated on 15 July 1931, at March Field, California, and assigned to the 17th Pursuit Group. In the early 1930s, the squadron flew Boeing P-12 and Boeing P-26 fighter aircraft until, in 1935, it was redesignated the 34th Attack Squadron, assigned to the similarly redesignated 17th Attack Group. P-12s continued to be flown after the establishment of the GHQ Air Force in March 1935. The squadron received its first Northrop A-17 attack dive bombers in July 1936.Editor, \\"New Airplanes For 17th Attack Group\\", Air Corps News Letter, Information Division, Air Corps, Munitions Building, Washington, D.C., 15 July 1936, Volume XIX, Number 14, page 4.https://www.scribd.com/document/76986615/Air-Force-News-Jul-Dec-1936 In 1939 the A-17 was considered obsolete, and the squadron was re-equipped with the new Douglas Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber, being re-designated as the 34th Bombardment Squadron. In June 1940 the squadron was moved to McChord Field, Washington where it began flying reconnaissance patrols over the Pacific Northwest. The B-18 had a short life in front-line service, and the 34th was re-equipped with the new North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber in February 1941, being one of the first squadrons in the Army Air Corps to receive the new bomber. In June, the squadron was reassigned to Pendleton Field, Oregon, as part of a dispersal plan by the Northwest Air District as part of the buildup of the Air Corps. In August, it received the updated B-25B, that had a much heavier defensive armament, dictated by the results of combat reports coming in from Europe. =World War II= In the immediate aftermath of the Pearl Harbor Attack, the 34th flew anti-submarine warfare patrols in the Pacific Northwest from 22 December 1941 to c. March 1942. It was reassigned to Lexington County Airport, South Carolina, on 9 February 1942 in order to meet the greater threat from German submarines operating off the East Coast. At that time, the only B-25s in service were with the 17th Bombardment Group. Planning for a retaliatory bombing raid on Japan began in December 1941, and the B-25 was determined to be the only Army land-based bomber with the range to be able to attack the Japanese Home Islands that could be launched (one-way) from an aircraft Carrier. Twenty-four B-25Bs were diverted from the 17th Bombardment Group, and volunteers from all three squadrons (34th, 37th and 95th) were recruited, the crews being told only that this was going to be a secret and very dangerous mission against heavy odds. The volunteers moved to Eglin Field in Florida for training. Still not knowing what kind of mission they were training for, the crews practiced making takeoffs in as short a distance as possible. Upon completion of training, seventeen crews left Eglin Field, some from the 34th for McClellan Field in California for final modifications to the B-25s before moving to Naval Air Station Alameda, where the bombers were loaded on the and the men of the Doolittle Raider task force departed on 2 April 1942. 34th Bombardment Squadron Martin B-26 Marauders returning from a mission, about 1943.

The remainder of the squadron remained in Columbia, flying antisubmarine patrols until 23 June when it was moved to Barksdale Field, Louisiana. There, the squadron was re-equipped with the Martin B-26 Marauder, and began transition training under Third Air Force. In November 1942, the squadron was deployed to North Africa in December 1942 as part of Operation Torch, and was assigned to the new Twelfth Air Force in Algeria. The squadron flew tactical bombing raids on enemy targets in Algeria and later Tunisia as the American forces moved east and participated in the Tunisian Campaign. Remaining assigned to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, the squadron flew combat missions in the invasion of Sicily; invasion of southern Italy; Corsican Campaign; and Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, during the summer of 1944. Moving into southern France, the squadron supported American ground forces moving north through Lyon and eventually joined American forces in eastern France which had participated in the northern France Campaign after the Normandy D-Day landings in June. The 39th participated in the Western Allied invasion of Germany in the spring of 1945, carrying out tactical bombing missions from Lyon Airfield, primarily hitting enemy targets in central and southern Germany until the German capitulation in May. After the end of hostilities, the 34th became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe occupation forces, being assigned to the American Zone of Occupation in Austria; performing occupation duty at Linz Airport and other cities. It remained in Austria until November 1945, its personnel being demobilized in France and returning to the United States. The squadron was inactivated as a paper unit in late November. =Korean War= B-26B Invaders on a day interdiction mission over Korea. The squadron was reactivated as part of the Tactical Air Command Ninth Air Force in 1947, and programmed as a Douglas A-26 Invader light bombardment squadron. Funding issues associated with the postwar Air Force meant that the \\"Attack Bomber\\" concept had to be shelved, with TAC's resources being put into jet fighters. In June 1948, the Attack designation category was officially eliminated and the aircraft was re- designated as the B-26. The B-26B and B-26Cs that were available were subsequently transferred to Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard units. Subsequently, the squadron was never manned or equipped and was inactivated in 1948. When the North Korean army invaded the South on 25 June 1950, the USAF was critically short of light bombers. In particular, the 1054 B-26s that were still officially in the USAF inventory were mostly in reserve units or in storage in the southwest. To meet the emergency needs of the Korean War, the 452d Bombardment Group (Light), an Air Force Reserve unit out of Long Beach Airport, California, was called to active duty. When the 452d reached the end of its federalization period, the group was re-designated as the 17th Bombardment Group (Light) as part of Far East Air Forces, and the reserve 728th Bombardment Squadron inactivated and its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the 34th Bombardment Squadron at Pusan West Air Base, South Korea, on 10 May 1952. Reserve personnel were replaced by active duty personnel that had been trained on the B-26 at George Air Force Base, California, then deployed to South Korea. During the conflict, the 17th and the 3d Bombardment Groups flew a total of 55,000 interdiction sorties throughout the war, at first in both day and night conditions and later almost exclusively at night. Attacks were carried out on Communist forces, primarily over South Korea, until the Korean War armistice. =Cold War= Tactical Air Command Douglas B-66B Destroyer in flight After the Korean armistice in June 1953, the squadron remained in South Korea for a year and a half until being moved to Miho Air Base, Japan in October 1954. Funding reductions after the Korean War led to the squadron's B-26s being reassigned to the 3d Bombardment Group; and the 34th, along with the 17th Bombardment Wing, was moved to Eglin Air Force Auxiliary Field No. 9, Florida on 1 April 1955 and transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC) as the 34th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical. At Eglin, the squadron was re-equipped with the new Martin B-57B Canberra, which had gone into service with TAC as a replacement for the B-26 Invader. The early model B-57Bs, however suffered from many technical problems, including an engine malfunction which filled up the cockpit with toxic fumes, which led to a brief grounding. The type was also found to be severely accident prone, due to difficulties with the aircraft's control surfaces. The Canberras were replaced by the Douglas B-66B Destroyer, which began arriving in March 1956, with the 34th being the first recipient. The B-66, being an Air Force version of the Navy Douglas A3D Skywarrior, was a much more reliable aircraft that filled the needs of the Air Force for a jet medium bomber. In January 1958, the squadron deployed to RAF Sculthorpe, England where its aircraft were subsequently transferred to the 47th Bombardment Wing, replacing obsolete North American B-45C Tornados. The 43d returned to Eglin Auxiliary Field No. 9 in March 1958, but due to budget issues, the squadron and its host 17th Bombardment Group were inactivated on 25 June 1958. Strategic Air Command The squadron designation was transferred from TAC to Strategic Air Command (SAC) in November 1962 as part of a process to re-designate Boeing B-52 Stratofortress \\"Strategic Wings\\", which were set up by SAC to disperse its bombers to numerous bases to avoid a single nuclear strike taking out an entire wing at one place. The dispersal, or \\"Strategic\\" wings consisted of one bomb and one air refueling squadron. As SAC Major Command designated units (MAJCOM), the wings were not able to carry a lineage or history as Air Force designated wings (AFCON) could. To remedy this, the Strategic Wings would be given designations of inactive MAJCOM Wings that had notable combat records in World War II, and/or low pre-war designations. The 17th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, was organized on 1 February 1963 which assumed the assets of the 4043d Strategic Wing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The 34th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, was placed under the 17th Bomb Wing, and assumed the personnel and B-52Es of the 42d Bombardment Squadron, which was inactivated. These changes were administrative in nature, and no actual personnel changes were made. The squadron stood nuclear alert at Wright-Patterson, and also provided crews to other Strategic Air Command units conducting combat operations over Southeast Asia ss part of Operation Arc Light, however the squadron's B-52Es were never deployed and remained on nuclear alert. Upgraded to the B-52H in 1968 when the E-models were retired and sent to storage at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base. The squadron moved to Beale Air Force Base, California when SAC pulled out of Wright- Patterson in 1975, absorbing the B-52G assets of the 744th Bombardment Squadron. It flew training missions at Beale for about a year when it was inactivated along with the 17th Bombardment Wing as part of the phaseout of the B-52 at Beale in 1976. =Modern era= The 34th Bomb Squadron was reactivated at Castle Air Force Base, California on 1 July 1992 by Air Combat Command. With the inactivation of SAC, ACC formed a B-52G squadron at Castle as a geographically separated unit of the 366th Wing, a composite wing based at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. It operated its B-52 squadron at Castle separately from the 93d Bomb Wing, that had the facilities to support the Stratofortress and provided logistical and maintenance support for the 34th. In early 1994 the B-52Gs were retired with the closing of Castle and the squadron was reassigned to Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota where it transitioned to the Rockwell B-1B Lancer, remaining part of the 366th Operations Group at Mountain Home. In 1997 the squadron moved to Mountain Home, taking its B-1s with it. In 2001, the squadron assigned conducted devastating attacks versus the Taliban and Al Queda after the 9/11 attacks. Reassigned to the 28th Bomb Wing in 2002 when the 366th ended its composite organization and moved back to Ellsworth. Deployed again to South Asia and, in 2003, the squadron kicked off Operation Iraqi Freedom with the largest precision guided bomb strike in history, when four B-1s delivered 96 GBU-31 2,000 lb JDAMs. Lineage * Organized as the 34th Aero Squadron on 11 June 1917 : Redesignated 34th Aero Squadron (Construction) on 25 July 1917 : Redesignated 34th Aero Squadron (Training) on 23 December 1917 : Demobilized on 10 June 1919 * Reconstituted and redesignated 34th Pursuit Squadron on 24 March 1923 : Organized in inactive status by June 1929 as a Regular Army Inactive unitRegular Army Inactive units had Organized Reserve officers assigned although they remained on the inactive list.Clay, p. 1399 * Activated on 15 July 1931 : Redesignated 34th Attack Squadron on 1 March 1935 : Redesignated 34th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) on 17 October 1939 : Redesignated 34th Bombardment Squadron, Medium on 9 October 1944 : Inactivated on 26 November 1945 * Redesignated 34th Bombardment Squadron, Light on 29 April 1947 : Activated on 19 May 1947 : Inactivated on 10 September 1948 * Redesignated 34th Bombardment Squadron, Light, Night Intruder on 8 May 1952 : Activated on 10 May 1952 : Redesignated 34th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical on 1 October 1955 : Inactivated on 25 June 1958 * Redesignated 34th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy and activated on 15 November 1962 (not organized) : Organized on 1 February 1963 : Inactivated on 30 September 1976 * Redesignated 34th Bomb Squadron and activated on 1 July 1992Lineage, including assignments, in Haulman, Factsheet 34 Bomb Squadron, except as noted. =Assignments= * Headquarters, Camp Kelly, 11 June 1917 * Aviation Concentration Center, 11 August 1917 * Air Service Headquarters, American Expeditionary Force, British Isles, 19 September 1917 (attached to Royal Flying Corps for training: 20 September – 18 December 1917) * Second Aviation Instructional Center, 23 December 1917 – May 1919 * Services of Supply, May 1919 * Eastern Department, 27 May – 10 June 1919 * 17th Pursuit Group (later 17th Attack Group, 17th Bombardment Group), 15 July 1931 – 26 November 1945The squadron was allotted to the Sixth Corps Area until 28 February 1927 and the Ninth Corps Area until 1 September 1928.

It belongs to the archipelago of the New Hebrides in the Pacific region of Melanesia. It is in the Sanma Province of Vanuatu. Population Given its small dimensions, it is not surprising that Araki Island has always had a low population. Census records as early as 1897 give 103 islanders, while there were 112 in 1989, and 121 in 1999. According to the 2009 census there were 140.2009 Census Summary release final - Government of Vanuatu However, this number does not accurately reflect the number of persons, who really live permanently on Araki Island: because of sustenance difficulties, many Arakians are forced to seek work on the main island of Espiritu Santo. As a result, several men, or even whole families, divide their time between the island and the mainland. The Arakian community is divided into 5 hamlets or villages. From west to east, these are: Pelinta, Parili, Parili-Aru, Vinapahura, and Sope. These are essentially extended family clans; these clans can be referred to as 'vapa' (literally 'cave'). In addition, there is a common area close to Sope, called the Mission. This is where the church, meeting house, cooperative, aid post, the Chief's house, the Pastor's house, and the women's club house are located. Income sources As is often the case in rural areas of Vanuatu, most of the inhabitants of Araki Island are subsistence farmers, exploiting the resources of land and sea for their own consumption; they also breed pigs and poultry. At the same time, many Arakians have developed various trade activities as sources of income: * culture of copra and especially cocoa * local stores and bakery * selling crabs, coconut crabs, fish, and fruit, to the local market of Luganville. For many Arakians, inland activities do not generate sufficient income. Therefore, they prefer to cultivate larger slots in the mainland Santo, or even choose to live in the local capital Luganville. Language The native inhabitants of Araki Island speak a unique language, called Araki after the island. The language is becoming extinct, as a result of contact of its speakers with neighbouring languages. Today, there are about 5 native speakers of Araki language. At encounters on the mainland, Arakians are exposed to languages other than their own - especially to Tangoa language and to the pidgin Bislama. The influence of Tangoa language is increased through inter-island marriages and through missionary and church influence, as church services are usually carried out in Bislama or Tangoa, and only occasionally in Araki language. The public school system is also another cause for the decreasing use of Araki language. First, because secondary school is officially held in French or English. Second, because the teachers usually come from different places of Vanuatu, and therefore speak Bislama. Third, because Araki Island only has a kindergarten and a primary school, in such a way that children are forced to continue their schooling on the mainland. References * François, Alexandre. 2002.

There are four mechanisms under which a decision of a magistrates' court may be challenged: * reconsideration by the same magistrates' court;Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, . * appeal to the Crown Court;. * appeal to the High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench Division) by way of case stated; and * judicial review in the High Court (Queen's Bench Division). Reconsideration by the magistrates' court A magistrates' court may set aside and vary decisions of its own court, in relation both to sentence and conviction. In relation to conviction, a magistrates' court may order a rehearing of a case against a person convicted by that magistrates' court. The court may exercise the power when it appears to be in the interests of justice to do so. There is no strict time-limit for making an application for a case to be re-heard but delay can be taken into account when deciding whether or not to order a re-hearing. A magistrates' court has power to vary or rescind an order made by it, which includes a sentence. The power is used where there has been a mistake. The power may exceptionally be used to increase sentence. Appeal to the Crown Court A person convicted of an offence by a magistrates' court may appeal to the Crown Court against their sentence.It is also possible to appeal against being bound over by the magistrates: Magistrates' Courts (Appeals from binding Over Orders) Act 1995, . A person who pleaded not-guilty may also appeal against his conviction. A person who has pleaded guilty may only appeal if his guilty plea was equivocal when made, if his guilty plea has subsequently shown to be equivocal, if he wishes to argue that he had already been acquitted or convicted of the same offence on another occasion, or where a reference is made by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The appeal to the Crown Court is by way of rehearing. New evidence may be called, but the Crown Court has no power to amend information upon which the appellant was convicted (or revoke amendments made by the magistrates' court).Garfield v Maddocks [19784] QB 7. The Crown Court will consider whether the decision of the magistrates' court was correct rather than whether it was reasonable. The Crown Court may confirm, reverse or vary the original decision or may remit the case to the magistrates' court.Supreme Court Act 1981, . The Crown Court may not order a sentence which the magistrates' court had no power to order. The appeal will ordinarily be heard by a Crown Court Judge and two magistrates (who will not be those involved in the original trial). If the appeal is from a youth court then there will ordinarily be one male and one female magistrate and each will be authorised to sit in the Youth Court.Criminal Procedure Rules, r. 63.8-9. Decisions on law should be made by the Crown Court judge. Decisions on the facts may be made by a majority. The presiding judge should give reasons for the decision, whether the appeal is allowed or refused. Irrespective of whether the convicted person is against sentence or conviction, he has not more than 21 days after sentence or the date sentence is deferred, whichever is earlier to lodge a notice of appeal.Criminal Procedure Rules, r. 63.2. No particular form is stipulated, but the notice must state whether the appeal is against conviction, against sentence or against both and the reasons for the appeal. Applications made out of time may be considered by the Crown Court, taking into account the merits of the case and the reasons for the delay. Pending the appeal, a person may be granted bail by the magistrates' courtMagistrates' Courts Act 1980, . or Crown Court. A party aggrieved by the decision of the Crown Court, may appeal by way of case statedSupreme Court Act 1981, . or apply for judicial review.Supreme Court Act 1981, . Appeal by way of case stated Following any conviction, order determination or other proceeding of the magistrates' court, both the accused and the prosecution may apply to that magistrates' court to state a case for the opinion of the high court. This process may be used where the challenge is on the basis that the magistrates' decision is wrong in law or is in excess of jurisdiction.Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, . The application to the magistrates must be made within 21 days of the decision being challenged. The application may be refused on the basis that the application is frivolous, so long as the justices issue a statement to that effect and briefly give their reasons. Any refusal may be challenged by way of application to the High Court. If the application is allowed, the justices' clerk will draft a \\"case\\", which is a document stating the facts of the case and the question or questions of law to be determined.Criminal Procedure Rules, r 64.6. The case will only contain evidence if one of the questions was whether there was any evidence on the basis of which the magistrates could convict. The appeal is to the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court. Two or three judges will sit. Two judges must agree for the application to be successful.Flannagan v Shaw [1920] 3 KB 96, 107. The Divisional Court may reverse, affirm or amend the decision of the magistrates' court, or remit the case to the magistrates' court.Supreme Court Act 1981, . The Divisional Court may make any order as it sees fit. The appellant has no right to bail but may be granted bail by the magistrates' court or, if the magistrates' court refuses, a judge of the High Court.Criminal Justice Act 1948, s. 37 (1) (b). Judicial review An application for judicial review may be made on the grounds that the magistrates' court has exceeded its powers by making an error of law, acting outside of its jurisdiction or breached natural justice. Applications may be made against convictions or sentence, but judicial review of sentence will rarely be appropriate. An application for judicial review may be made promptly and not later than after three months after the decision of the magistrates' court of which the applicant complains.Civil Procedure Rules, r. 54.5 . Where the magistrates' court has acted outside of its powers, the High Court may grant quashing orders, mandatory orders and prohibiting orders. These orders are discretionary and may be refused in the interests of justice. Appeal by way of case-stated should be the ordinary method of challenge where it is alleged there has been an error of law. Judicial review should not be used to evade the 21-day time-limit.
