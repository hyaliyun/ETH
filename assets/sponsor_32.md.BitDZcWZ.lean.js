Life  Sohaemus was a prominent person in the Roman Empire in the 2nd century from the Orontid dynasty of Commagene and the Emesene dynasty from Syria.Birley, Septimius Severus: the African emperor, p.71 The novelist of the 2nd century, his contemporary Iamblichus claims Sohaemus as his fellow-countryman. Iamblichus calls Sohaemus as an Arsacid and Achaemenid, in his lineage. He was a descendant of the Median Princess Iotapa, who was once betrothed to the Ptolemaic Prince Alexander Helios.Birley, Septimius Severus: the African emperor, pp. 71, 224 Little is known about Sohaemus‚Äô family and early life prior to becoming King of Armenia.According to Christian Settipani, Sohaemus was the son of Avitus (Gaius Julius Avitus), son of Sohaemus (Gaius Julius Longinus Sohaemus), son of Sampsiceramus, son of Alexio, son of Sohaemus Before becoming King, Sohaemus had been a Roman Senator and served as a Consul in Rome at an unknown date. In 144, Sohaemus received the Armenian throne from the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius after the overthrow of Vologases I. In honor of his first ascent to the throne of Armenia, a copper medal with images of Sohaemus and Antoninus Pius was issued in Rome with the inscription \\"King of Armenians granted by decision of the Senate\\". Sohaemus was a contemporary to the rule of the Roman emperors: Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus and Commodus of the Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty. In the first reign, he ruled from the year 144 until 161. Not much is known about his first reign. The novelist Iamblichus living in Armenia at the time of his rule describes his reign as ‚Äòin succession to his ancestors‚Äô. This statement can also refer to his former ancestor Sohaemus of Emesa who lived in the 1st century. In 161 Vologases IV of Parthia, son of the legitimate King Mithridates IV of Parthia, dispatched his troops to seize Armenia and eradicated the Roman legions stationed in the country under the legatus Marcus Sedatius Severianus. Encouraged by the Spahbod Osroes, Parthian troops marched further West into Roman Syria.Sellwood Coinage of Parthia 257-260, 268-277; Debevoise History of Parthia 245; Dio Cass.71.2.1. After Armenia was seized by the Parthians, Sohaemus went into political exile, living in Rome where he became a senator.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 131 Sohaemus was well known in Rome and there were rumors in some quarters that he was not the right man in the right place.van den Hout, A commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto, pp. 301-2 These events provoked a new Roman-Parthian war and peace was made on Roman terms, with Sohaemus installed as King of Armenia by Lucius Verus in either 163 or 164. The ceremony for Sohaemus in becoming Armenian King for the second time, may have taken place in Antioch or Ephesus.Bowman, The Cambridge ancient history: The High Empire, A.D. 70-192, p.163 This war cost Rome dearly, because the victorious army brought with it from the east a plague that spread very quickly throughout the empire. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tried to declare Armenia as a province of Rome, but the uprising of Armenians led by Prince Tiridates forced the Romans to abandon their plans. In 164, Latin coinage were struck in Armenia with the inscription L. Verus. Aug. Armeniacus and on the reverse Rex Armen(ii)s datus. The time of his second reign is unknown.Birley, Septimius Severus: the African emperor, p.72 Sohaemus reigned from 163 perhaps up to 186. Under Sohaemus, construction work continued in the capital Vagharshapat. A citadel, defensive fortifications, a palace complex, and several pagan temples were built in the city. Sometime during his reign, Sohaemus was expelled by elements favorable to Parthia.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp.174-5 Sohaemus was expelled because a man called Tiridates stirred up trouble in Armenia who had murdered the King of the Osroenes and had thrust his sword in the face of Publius Martius Verus, the governor of Cappadocia when rebuked for it. Tiridates only punishment for his crimes was to be exiled to Roman Britain, by Marcus Aurelius. As a result of Sohaemus‚Äô second expulsion from Armenia; Roman forces went to war with Parthian soldiers. Parthia retook most of their lost territory in 166, as Sohaemus from his expulsion retreated to Syria.HA Verus 8.1-4; Dio Cass. 71.2. After Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus and the Parthian rulers intervened in the conflict, the son of Vologases IV of Parthia, Vologases II assumed the Armenian throne in 186.

Lenses produced under the name Metrogon also cite the US patent of the Topogon design. The initial design patented by Richter was for a f=66mm 6.3 lens, although the patent also contains two other refinements to the basic design, including one that used parallel elements to minimize vignetting. Topogon lenses have been produced with maximum apertures ranging from f/3.5 to f/15 in various focal lengths. According to Richter, the Topogon was developed from the earlier Hypergon.In the paper, Richter attributed the Hypergon design to Emil von H√∂egh; the 1900 patent for the Hypergon is credited to Carl Paul Goerz, a frequent collaborator with von H√∂egh. Although the Hypergon covered a wide angle of view (140¬∞) and had good flatness of field and distortion characteristics, the maximum aperture was limited to 22 to control longitudinal spherical aberration and chromatic aberration. A new computation of a \\"fast\\" Hypergon was made by limiting the angle of view to 90¬∞, increasing maximum aperture to 6.3. The Topogon was then derived from the \\"fast\\" Hypergon by adding a second set of strongly curved meniscus elements inboard of the larger spherical elements to correct longitudinal spherical aberration. The Topogon was later developed into the Pleogon lens by Richter and Friedrich Koch in 1956. The Pleogon, used for photogrammetry, used a cemented achromatic lens just ahead of the central stop and added two meniscus groups on either side to maintain lens symmetry.

Kansas Avenue, Topeka, Kansas, photographed in 2012. Constitution Hall, in Topeka, Kansas, is one of the most famous buildings dating from the history of early Kansas. It was a two-story building constructed between April and October 1855 of native limestone with a flat roof on the 400 block of Kansas Avenue, then in the center of Topeka's downtown, by brothers Loring and John Farnsworth. It remained uncompleted for a period. After its walls were plastered in October, those opposed to introducing slavery into Kansas Territory met in what became the Topeka Constitutional Convention which opened October 23, 1855. Almost forty delegates, who all opposed slavery and the Southern element in Kansas, met. At the time, the Southerners, through a fraudulent election, controlled the legal government of the territory, which committed many illegal acts. The element controlled by the Northern immigrants into Kansas established their own government, which had no legal standing. The convention produced what became known as the Topeka Constitution, which the United States House of Representatives adopted in July 1856, but failed in the Senate by two votes. Parts were incorporated into the Kansas state constitution drafted in 1861. Constitution Hall became the meeting place of the Northern element's government and legislature. This legislature drew the wrath of the Southerners in Congress, who asked President Franklin Pierce, a Northerner, to intervene. In July 1856, Pierce dispatched federal troops, led by Col. Edwin V. Sumner, to disperse the Topeka legislature. The troops arrived at Constitution Hall on July 4. Facing soldiers with rifles, bayonets, and a cannon, the members of the Topeka Legislature were forced to disperse. The government of the Northern element continued to meet at Constitution Hall, sometimes storing supplies seized in Southern communities in the basement of the building. By the early 1860s abutting buildings were constructed to the north and south of Constitution Hall, making it part of a contiguous row of buildings. When Kansas became a state in 1861, Topeka became the capital. Capitol of Kansas, 1863-1869 The new government planned a permanent capitol building but constructed a temporary facility in 1863 by remodeling Constitution Hall and some of the adjacent structures to create what became known as State Row. In an 1870s photo in the archives of the Kansas Historical Society, State Row occupies bays 11 through 21 and is easily distinguishable from other nearby structures. While State Row served as the Kansas capitol, the east wing of the current State Capitol was under construction. It was completed in 1869 and the State offices occupied the new space. Commercial uses, 1869-2006 When the last offices vacated State Row December 25, 1869, the buildings became home to several occupants including an arms dealer, mortuary, used book seller, pharmacy, jeweler, cutlery shop, furniture store, dry goods store, restaurants, offices and residential apartments and were remodeled extensively over the next 100 years making it difficult to determine which structures comprised State Row and which was Constitution Hall. On July 4, 1903, the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated a plaque in the sidewalk to mark the site of Constitution Hall. However, over time pedestrian traffic wore-down the details of the plaque, so leaders decided to mount it on the fa√ßade of the building. The owner of the Topeka Cutlery Shop at 429 South Kansas Avenue volunteered to have it placed outside his shop. However, there is disagreement whether the structure at 429 was actually Constitution Hall or a part of it. By the mid-1980s, the area around the cutlery shop was being abandoned for several reasons. In 1986, Cy Cohen, owner of the cutlery shop, was murdered during a robbery, and the store closed. Other businesses came and went, but none occupied 429 S. Kansas Avenue and by 1990, much of the 400 block had been razed, with Cohen's shop facing the same fate due to its poor condition. In the early 1990s, local historians and preservationists made an effort to rehabilitate the buildings of State Row but disagreed about the validity of saving the buildings. Some suggested that the block of buildings on the site had been gutted to the point that nothing of the original structure still existed and their effort failed. Official recognition Eventually, through further investigation of the building characteristics, the groups were able to determine that 427 and 429 S. Kansas Avenue were Constitution Hall and garner additional support. They formed the Friends of the Free State Capitol Inc. to preserve the building. Much happened in the first decade of the 21st century to ensure the building's survival. In 2001, the National Park Service added the two addresses to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. In October 2002, the National Park Service announced a planning grant of $7,500 to the Friends of the Free State Capitol. Later the City of Topeka presented a $27,000 grant to the organization to upgrade Constitution Hall's roof. In 2006, the Friends group sponsored a large mural that covers the fronts of some buildings of State Row to commemorate Constitution Hall and the 1856 dispersal of the unofficial territorial legislature. Finally, on July 15, 2008, Constitution Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some visitors reported sensations indicating that Constitution Hall was haunted. A paranormal group scheduled an investigation for October 2008, but did not report any findings. Restoration efforts began in 2011 and will continue as funding becomes available.

Early life John Fozard was born on 16 January 1928 at 21 Home Street, Millbridge Liverage, the son of John Fozard and Eleanor Paulkitt. He was brought up on the Firthcliffe Estate at Littletown, Liversedge, Kirklees, west of Heckmondwike. He grew up in austerity because his father was unemployed due to spinal injuries and only his maternal grandmother was in full-time employment. He passed the selection for Heckmondwike Grammar School in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where he excelled academically.Spenborough Guardian In 1942 (aged 14) he joined the Air Training Corps and with tthem visited RAF stations, where he flew in Lancaster and Halifax bombers. Fozard's headmaster arranged for interviews with Avro in Yeadon and Blackburn Aircraft in Leeds. Blackburn offered him an apprenticeship that allowed him to study for an engineering degree. In June 1946 he was awarded a London University Intermediate degree. At this time Blackburn transferred Fozard to their Brough site, which allowed to continue his studies full-time at Hull municipal technical college, funded by a West Riding Council scholarship. In July 1948 he was awarded a B.Sc with first class honours in aeronautical engineering. An extension of his scholarship allowed him to undertake two years postgraduate studies at College of Aeronautics, Cranfield under Prof Sir Robert Lickley where he gained a DCAe (Diploma in Aeronautics) in 1950. Fozard would later tell American visitors at the Hawker plant on Lower Ham Road next to the River Thames at Kingston upon Thames that Yorkshire was the Texas of the UK. Career He worked for Hawker Siddeley from 1950, working under Sydney Camm. In the late 1950s he was working on the supersonic successor to the company's Hawker Hunter, the P.1121, and the twin-seat P.1129. Although advanced designs for their time, these projects were cancelled by the infamous 1957 Defence White Paper, and Hawker concentrated all work on the P.1127, which had been considered less important up to that point. From October 1963 he was Chief Designer of the P.1154, which was cancelled in February 1965 (with the BAC TSR-2). He was Chief Designer of the Harrier from 1965 to 1978, taking over from Ralph Hooper. The Harrier entered service with the RAF (at RAF Wittering) in August 1969. The first Sea Harrier (XZ451 ‚Äì FRS.1) was handed to the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm on 18 June 1979, at a ceremony at BAe Dunsfold (the site had been owned by Hawker Siddeley from 1950), later to be based at RNAS Yeovilton. This version of the Harrier had been given the definitive go-ahead (funding) on 15 May 1975 by Roy Mason, the Barnsley-born Defence Secretary, after being met with government indifference previously. The Pegasus engine, which was integral to the aircraft design, was designed by Gordon Lewis and Sir Stanley Hooker. From 1984‚Äì7 he was Divisional Director of Special Projects at the Military Aircraft Division of British Aerospace, Weybridge. In February 1989 he retired from BAe. He later became the Director of the National Air and Space Museum, and held the Charles A. Lindbergh Chair in Aerospace History, from 1988‚Äì9. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS) in 1963. From 1986 to 1987, he was the President of the Royal Aeronautical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1987.

He later married Gloria Roberts in 1985, and they lived in Alexandria, Virginia. He was awarded the OBE in 1981. He died from liver failure, aged 68.

In all three cases the parents read Pearl's book and are believed to have been homeschooling their children. Michael Ramsey, the district attorney who prosecuted the Schatz case, investigated the Pearls' teachings and called To Train Up A Child, \\"an extraordinarily dangerous book for those who take it literally.\\" \\"It's truly an evil book,\\" he said. Dr. Frances Chalmers, the pediatrician who examined Williams' death, said ‚ÄúMy fear is that this book, while perhaps well intended, could easily be misinterpreted and could lead to what I consider significant abuse.‚Äù Responses On his website, Pearl issued his official responses to the controversy over To Train Up a Child and the deaths of Hana Williams and Lydia Schatz. The responses list quotes from Pearl‚Äôs book that warn against abuse. In an article published after Schatz's death, Pearl explained, \\"I laugh at my caustic critics, for our properly-spanked and trained children grow to maturity in great peace and love.\\" Pearl has also spoken to the media about the controversy, stating that the ¬º-inch diameter plastic tubing he recommends in the book is \\"too light to cause damage to the muscle or the bone.\\" Pearl stated of the death of Hana Williams, ‚ÄúWhat her parents (allegedly) did is diametrically opposed to the philosophy of No Greater Joy Ministries and what is taught in the book.‚Äù The Seattle Times noted that there is no mention in To Train Up a Child of the discipline used on Hana Williams except for spanking, although \\"spanking is clearly the heart of the book.\\" The New York Times suggests that the Williams' other discipline tactics involve Pearl‚Äôs book taken to extremes, such as Pearl's advice that \\"a little fasting is good training.\\" A witness in the trial reported that the Williamses followed the book's recommendations \\"to use a switch, cold baths, withhold food and force children outside in cold weather as punishment,\\" all of which were used on Williams before her death.

He was one of the two representatives of James City County, Virginia. Birth; Settlement in Virginia; House of Burgesses Sources conflict as to whether William Powell was born in 1577 or 1585 or whether these were the years of birth of one or two other men of the same name. Although his date of birth is uncertain, the colonist William Powell obviously was born in England. William Powell, described as a gentleman, arrived in the Third Supply mission of nine ships, which brought additional settlers and some supplies to the surviving colonists at Jamestown, Virginia in 1609.McCartney, Martha W. Virginia immigrants and adventurers, 1607-1635: a biographical dictionary. Baltimore: Genealogical Pub. Co., 2007. . p. 576 Another source states that the records of the Virginia Company showed that William Powell, a subscriber of the company, came to Virginia in 1611 with Lieutenant Governor Sir Thomas Gates aboard the Sea Venture.Dorman, John Frederick. Adventurers of Purse and Person, Virginia, 1607-1624/5: Families G-P. Fourth Edition, Volume 2. Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, 2005. . Retrieved July 21, 2011. p. 765 These statements are not entirely incompatible. The small ships of the Third Supply mission arrived in Jamestown in 1609 and Powell, who is identified as being in Jamestown before May 1610, must have been on one of those ships. The Sea Venture, with Sir Thomas Gates and other prominent passengers, was beached in Bermuda after being caught in a hurricane and separated from the other ships. The surviving passengers did not arrive in Jamestown until May 1610, after being stranded in Bermuda for 42 weeks. They had to build two small vessels from remains of the Sea Venture and cedar from the island in order to complete their journey.Tyler, Lyon Gardiner. The cradle of the republic: Jamestown and James river. Richmond, VA: Hermitage Press, 1906. . Retrieved July 21, 2011. p. 26None of the Sea Venture passengers were lost in the storm or the stranding of the ship but some of them did not survive their time on Bermuda. On February 9, 1610,Tyler gives a February 9, 1611 date. Although this does not correlate with an earlier presence of Powell in Virginia, it would not require Powell to have been in Virginia before the arrival of the Sea Venture passengers. On the other hand, Powell's name is not on the extant partial lists of Sea Venture passengers and the date could be equivalent to 1610 because of the peculiarities of the old calendar that was still in use at that time. the Acting Governor Captain John Percy sent \\"Ensign Powell\\" and Ensign Waller to capture, or kill if necessary, Wochinchopunck, the chief of the Paspahegh and a sub-chief or tributary of the Powhatan. The chief had been harassing and even killing colonists. He even had tried to kill Captain John Smith during the previous year but Smith subdued him and took him prisoner, only to have him later escape. Finding they could not capture the strong Wochinchopunck, Powell killed him with a sword. Lieutenant Puttock, who had been closely following Powell and Waller, killed one of the chief's men.Tyler, 1906, pp. 102-103 Deputy Governor Samuel Argall appointed William Powell as captain, responsible for the Jamestown defenses and its blockhouses, and further appointed him lieutenant governor in 1617.Argall was Lt. Governor or Deputy Governor between 1617 and 1619. He also was referred to as Principal Governor of Virginia but this only may have been after the death of Governor Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who died at sea on his way back to Virginia, in large part to investigate Argall's alleged harsh conduct, on June 7, 1618. Argall had been one of Governor West's ship captains on his early voyages to Virginia. Argall may have wanted a second in command in the colony in the events something happened to him, even before he learned of Governor West's death. Argall was succeeded as governor in 1619 by George Yeardley. No further mention of Powell as lieutenant governor has been found. Powell was a member of the first Virginia House of Burgesses in 1619, representing James City County, Virginia.Stanard, William G. and Mary Newton Stanard. The Virginia Colonial Register. Albany, NY: Joel Munsell's Sons Publishers, 1902. , Retrieved July 15, 2011. p. 52 Powell lived on the \\"Surry side\\" of James City County, on the south side of the James River from Jamestown, Virginia.

Retrieved July 20, 2011. p. 88 In 1620, Argall contracted with, or possibly even ordered, Powell to clear land and build houses for new colonists at Martin's Hundred. Powell tried to force the newcomers to pay for the work but they were able to show this would be unjust because Argall had actually put their site in the wrong location. In April 1622, soon after the Indian massacre of March 22, 1622, Captain Powell established, or at least secured rights to, property in order to establish a large plantation on the Chickahominy River. Richard Pace, an \\"Ancient Planter\\", had 10 shares in this enterprise but soon ceded them to Captain Powell.Dorman, 2005, p. 765 William Powell himself was an \\"Ancient Planter.\\"Ancient planter is a term applied to colonists who migrated to the Plantation of Virginia \\"before the coming away of Sir Thomas Dale\\" in 1616, and continued there for at least three years. These colonists received the first land grants in Virginia. Those who paid their own passage to Virginia received a \\"first dividend\\" of 100 acres (0.40 km2), free of quit-rent. Those who were brought at the Company's expense also received 100 acres, subject to an annual rent of one shilling per 50 acres. Massacre; militia action; death A great Native American (Indian) massacre of at least 347 of the 1,258 Virginia colonists occurred on March 22, 1622.

Since Powell and Pace lived near each other and were business associates, it appears that Pace warned Powell and that both men proceeded to warn other people in the neighborhood of Jamestown, as stated in William Stith's 1740 history of the colony.Stith, William (1740). The History of the First Discovery and Settlement of Virginia. Reprinted for Joseph Sabin in 1865. Spartanburg, SC: Reprint Co., 1965. . Immediately after the attack, Powell went to Martin's Hundred to help evacuate the survivors. He took possession of the estate of Nathaniel Powell, who was killed along with his wife during the attack. It was later determined Powell was not related to Nathaniel as he had claimed. Nathaniel's older brother, Thomas Powell, succeeded to ownership of the property. Soon after beginning the Chickahominy River enterprise mentioned above, Captain William Powell was killed leading a party of militia against the Native Americans (Indians). The militia were seeking revenge for the March 22, 1622 massacre. Captain William Powell, as he is identified in the list of Burgesses, may have died in late 1622 or possibly in January 1623. A letter of January 24, 1623 from colonist John Harrison to his brother, Richard Harrison, states that Captain Powell, and others, were dead.Coldham, Peter Wilson.

It is also the parent company of Broad Sustainable Building, a prefab building company. The company was established in 1996 and exports products to over 60 countries. It was Shanghai Expo 2010's only global official partner that was a Chinese private enterprise and the exclusive supplier of central air conditioning, ventilation and air purification products for the event. Broad is one of the few Chinese manufacturing companies that has been widely recognized for its green policies and commitment to countering climate change. It has expanded its business in recent years to include other energy saving products and sustainable buildings through its subsidiary Broad Sustainable Building, and achieved the feat of building a 15-story tall hotel in six days, which received two million views in the first ten days after being released on YouTube. More recently, the firm succeeded in erecting a 30-story hotel in 15 days. History 1988-1992: The early years Born in Changsha in 1960, Zhang Yue was unable to attend school until he was nine years old thanks to the Cultural Revolution, which temporarily shut down most schools in the country. He worked as a librarian and teaching drawing at primary school. He founded Broad in 1988, registering the company in Chenzhou, Hunan province. Using his savings of $3000, Broad developed industrial boilers based on Zhang's patented design. In the 1980s, most domestically manufactured boilers were of poor quality and had high risk of exploding, while Broad's did not. His current wealth is estimated at $1,5 billion. 1992-2005: Move to Changsha and rise In 1992, the company was moved to Changsha and began manufacturing absorption chillers. At the time, government provided incentives for non-electric chillers to relieve strain on the national electricity grid, contributing to the company's rise as it became the global leader in absorption chiller by sales in 1996; it entered the international market in 1998 and today, its sales in domestic and international markets split evenly. 2005‚Äìpresent: From manufacturing to sustainable construction While absorption chillers remain Broad's largest source of revenue, it now offers other environmentally friendly products including air purifiers and air conditioner terminals, with the BSB (Broad Sustainable Building) its latest invention in sustainable building technology, receiving more attention. 2012: Sky City One BSB, the building construction subsidiary of Broad group, announced plans to build Sky City One, the world's tallest tower, with a height of 838m. The announcement made headlines not only for the size of the tower, but also for an audacious construction plan that involved completion in just 90 days. In 2015, BSB built a 57-storey Mini Sky City that stands at a height of 204m. The construction of the tower took just 19 days. Tower was built using pre-manufactured steel modules which are also going to be used in construction of the Sky City One. 2016: SkyCity Challenge In 2016 SkyCity Challenge a biannual architectural design Challenge is formed by the support of Broad Group. The series started by launching ‚ÄúSkyCity Challenge 17‚Äù with over 400 registered teams from around the globe. The aim of the challenge was to design the interior atriums of 57-storey Mini Sky City.  Innovations Invented in 2009, the BSB achieves high energy efficiency and carbon reduction primarily through thermal insulation, preventing cool air from leaving indoors and hot air from coming in from outdoors when the weather is hot and vice versa when the weather is cold, and requires short construction time since parts are pre- fabricated in factories and assembled onsite. At the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference, President of Mexico, Felipe Calder√≥n, called the BSB technology \\"a practical, imaginative, creative & bold endeavor and a new revolution of world's architectural and housing industry\\", which is bound to be transferred to developing countries leading to reduction in carbon emissions. BSB has also been tested to be able to resist a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and was recommended in a United Nations Environment Program report on the rebuilding of Sichuan after its catastrophic earthquake in 2008.  Broad Sustainable Building  So far, Broad has built four demos of BSB, including the six-story Broad Pavilion in Shanghai Expo 2010 in one day, the 14-story New Ark's Hotel in Broad's headquarters in six days, the Broad Pavilion in 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference in eight days, and a 30-story hotel prototype near Dongting lake in 15 days.30-story building built in 15 days Environmental record Awards and recognition In May, 2011, Broad's founder and chairman, Zhang Yue, was awarded the Champions of the Earth Award (Entrepreneurial Vision Category) by the United Nations Environment Programme for Broad's commitment to climate change. It was one of the ten companies to be recognized by the BusinessWeek Greener China Business Awards in 2009. It was also named one of the \\"20 Most Admired Companies in China\\" in 2001, ‚Äô02, ‚Äô04, and ‚Äô05 by China's Economic Observer and Peking University. Refusing to invest in electric chiller market In 2000, amid temporary company sales drop, and huge demands for cooling equipment of all kinds in China, Zhang was urged to enter the much larger market for electric air conditioners. Zhang refused, citing that after successfully challenging himself to create wealth when the company was started, his current only motive was to \\"save energy and reduce greenhouse emissions.\\" A Carnegie Council article cited a 2004 Peking University‚ÄìRichard Ivey School of Business case study on Zhang's decision and reports \\"the authors argue that Broad would likely have gained 'a significant market share' and earned '10 times' its production cost in this product area‚Äîbut in doing so it would not have been able to 'stay true to the company's environmental protection principles.'\\" Global involvement  Broad has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2001. In October 2008, Broad formally joined The Climate Group, being among the first group of Chinese global members.

Healy served as General Secretary of the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia from 1937 to his death in 1961, a period when the union recovered from its defeat in the 1928 waterfront strike to become one of the most powerful trade unions in Australia. Healy was one of the most prominent public representatives of the communist movement in Australia during the Cold War. Biography Healy was born at West Gorton in Manchester, the son of corporation labourer Dominic Healy and cotton-worker Mary Ellen, n√©e Schaill. He attended St Francis of Assisi parish school and began assisting Labour Party canvassers at the age of 8. He enlisted in the 8th Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1915; served until he was wounded in action on the Western Front in 1918 and discharged. On his return he moved to Scotland to work as a plate-layer in the tramways. On 19 July 1919 Healy married woollen weaver Elizabeth McGowan at St Cuthbert's Catholic Church in Edinburgh. They and their three sons emigrated to Queensland in 1925, where Healy began work as a fireman and boiler attendant at Mackay. He became a wharf labourer in 1927 and the following year was elected to the management committee of the Waterside Workers' Federation (WWF) becoming branch president in 1929. Disappointed with the underperformance of various Labor governments in response to the Great Depression, Healy joined the Communist Party of Australia in 1934 after a tour of the Soviet Union. Healy moved to Sydney in 1936 and in 1937 was elected general secretary of the WWF, a position he held until his death in 1961. He transferred the union head office from Melbourne in 1939, and is given credit for modernising the union and he was the founder and first editor of the WWF's national journal, the Maritime Worker. In 1937 and 1938 he campaigned in support of waterside workers' boycotts of Japan, and he continued to strengthen the WWF during World War II due to the industry's contribution to the war effort. From 1945 to 1949 he led a boycott on the Black Armada of Dutch ships, in order to support the Indonesian independence movement. Healy oversaw the amalgamation of the WWF with the Permanent & Casual Wharf Labourers' Union (PCWLU), but the antagonism of many in the WWF towards the PCWLU weakened his position. In the 1949 Australian coal strike he was gaoled for contempt of court, having refused to disclose the whereabouts of money used to assist the strikers; sentenced to a year, he was released after apologising five weeks into his sentence. He was active in the campaign against the Menzies government's attempt to ban the Communist Party. A committee of inquiry into the waterside industry was established by the Stevedoring Industry Act of 1954, in an attempt by the government to end the WWF's monopoly on wharf labour supply; the federation went on strike with the support of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU); the government went ahead with further reforms, but Healy was appointed to the ACTU executive in 1957. Healy died of a cerebrovascular accident in 1961 at Darlinghurst and was cremated; he was farewelled in Sussex Street with a \\"comrade's farewell\\" (Healy was an atheist), attended by hundreds of mourners. The Internationale was played and the cort√®ge stretched for almost a mile, blocking traffic for over an hour.

Baynard was probably born at Preston, Lancashire. In 1665, at the time of the great plague, he was sometimes at Chiswick and sometimes in London. He entered the university of Leyden for the study of medicine in 1671, and most likely graduated there. He became an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians of London in 1684, and a fellow in 1687. Previously to this he had commenced practice at Preston. From about the year 1675, and onward for twenty-six years, it was his custom to visit the hot baths at Bath. He was established there as a physician, as well as in London, which was his home, his address in 1701 being the Old House, Ludgate Hill. Dr. Baynard is said to have been the ‚ÄòHoroscope‚Äô of Garth's ‚ÄòDispensary.‚Äô Sir John Floyer's treatise on cold bathing, entitled ‚ÄòThe ancient Psychrolousia revived‚Äô (1702), has appended to it a letter from Dr. Baynard ‚Äòcontaining an Account of many Eminent Cures done by the Cold Baths in England; together with a Short Discourse of the wonderful Virtues of the Bath Waters on decayed Stomachs, drank Hot from the Pump.‚Äô Dr. Baynard's popular work entitled ‚ÄòHealth, a Poem.

Another edition, also called the ninth, was published at London in 1764. The preface, partly in verse and partly in prose, is mainly directed against drunkenness; and the poem itself is made up of homely medical advice.

The existing 40 MeV drift tube LINAC and RF cavities have been replaced by an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source embedded in a 200 kV high-voltage terminal and induction acceleration cells, respectively. A DA is, in principle, capable of accelerating any species of ion in all possible charge states. The KEK-DA is characterized by specific accelerator components such as a permanent magnet X-band ECR ion source, a low-energy transport line, an electrostatic injection kicker, an extraction septum magnet operated in air, combined-function main magnets, and an induction acceleration system. The induction acceleration method, integrating modern pulse power technology and state-of-art digital control, is crucial for the rapid-cycle KEK-DA. The key issues of beam dynamics associated with low- energy injection of heavy ions are beam loss caused by electron capture and stripping as results of the interaction with residual gas molecules and the closed orbit distortion resulting from relatively high remanent fields in the bending magnets. Disturbing as it may sound, imagine cancer cells located near a human organ, cells that need to be treated. One of the most promising treatments is to irradiate cancer cells with high energy particles in order to ionize the DNA molecules in the cancer cells, breaking the molecules and killing the cells. Doctors can use radiation to damage the cancer cells but not the healthy cells around them. Particle therapy uses a property of particles called the Bragg peak of energy disposition. When a particle travels through a material, it deposits energy to its surroundings as it travels, before it comes to a complete halt. It turns out that ions lose most of their energy immediately before they come to stop. This property can be used to target cancer cells that are located at certain distance from the skin, without affecting healthy tissues on its way. Another well known radiation therapy for cancer, X-ray therapy, cannot do this. The energy loss spectrum is much broader so that much of the energy gets absorbed by the surrounding, damaging unwanted regions. This feature remains the same for the recently developed technique called intensity-modulated radiotherapy CHHIP. Sense and response would be the right words to describe the principle behind the digital particle accelerator. Instead of radio-frequency cavities, a digital accelerator ring is equipped with devices called induction accelerating cells. Particles travel around the ring in a form of a bunch. When a charged particle bunch passes a beam sensor, the system picks up the signals and calculates the timing to generate the pulse voltage required to accelerate the bunch, and then produces the pulse voltage energizing a transformer. Using the intense, well-controlled heavy ion beam, scientists will be able to make mesh filters with nanometer-sized holes. Such a material could be used as a hemoglobin filter for blood. The intense ion beam can also alter material properties in diamond when shot into it to change the crystalline structure, making an insulator a conductor. This will allow production of three-dimensional nanometer-sized circuits. Applications of such circuit might completely change the industry of semiconductor devices, and may be useful for such future technologies as a quantum computer. Because heavy ions transfer energy to their surroundings much more efficiently than gamma-rays or X-rays, a digital accelerator will also make an excellent tool to induce mutations, by breaking off the DNA's double helix. This has important applications in environmental science. Combining induced mutation with genetic engineering is a promising approach to developing crops with larger yields of food and biofuels. On the other hand, astrophysicists plan to use the digital accelerator technology to create high-temperature, high-pressure conditions like those in Jupiter's core. Biologists also plan to use the digital accelerator to produce the interstellar environment and explore how life can be formed in the interstellar environment of the cosmic rays and cosmic medium.

The perpetrators included a girl he was dating and his best friend since childhood. Due to the manner in which Sweeney was murdered, the ages of the teens involved, and the seeming indifference of the perpetrators, the crime received national media coverage. Murder Jason Sweeney had left school and was working for his father, a contractor, on a building project in Philadelphia. He had recently met a girl he liked, 15-year-old Justina Morley, with whom he had a date on the evening of Friday, May 30, 2003. Unbeknownst to Sweeney, Morley had engaged in sexual relations with two other 16-year-olds, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr. Batzig had been Sweeney's best friend since the fourth grade. Nicholas Coia and his 17-year-old brother, Domenic Coia, had also been friendly with Sweeney, but the brothers later ended the friendship. With the promise of sex, Morley lured Sweeney to \\"The Trails,\\" a wooded area of Fishtown near the Delaware River, where Batzig and the Coia brothers were lying in wait. Batzig took the first blow, striking Sweeney in the head four to five times. Batzig and the Coia brothers then pummeled Sweeney, primarily on his head and face, with a hatchet, a hammer and a rock until he was dead. Batzig later told a detective how he hit Sweeney with the hatchet face four or five times. Batzig said, \\"Jason started begging for his life, but we just kept hitting him.\\" Batzig also said that Sweeney looked at him during the beating and said \\"Please stop, I'm bleeding,\\" after which Batzig hit Sweeney again with the axe. They finished by dropping a boulder on the right side of his head. Sweeney's head was crushed and the only bone left undamaged was his left cheekbone. He was identified by a cut on his hand that he sustained at his construction job. Following Sweeney's murder, the four assailants stole the $500 cash he had earned from work. Before leaving the crime scene, the Coias, Batzig and Morley shared a group hug and split the money, which they used to buy jewelry and illegal drugs‚Äîheroin, marijuana and Xanax‚Äîand then \\"partied beyond redemption,\\" according to Domenic. Domenic Coia confessed in a court hearing that they were all involved in the murder of Sweeney. The police said the murder was planned days before. Part of the preparation of the murder was listening to the Beatles song \\"Helter Skelter\\" over forty times, prompting later news coverage to draw a parallel to the Manson family murders. Joshua Staab, 18, a friend of Domenic Coia, said that the group had bragged about their plan to kill Sweeney by using Justina Morley as \\"bait.\\" Staab also said that Batzig knew that Sweeney would have his paycheck earnings on him on the day of the murder. The prosecutor asked Staab about the teens' demeanor after the killing. Staab said, \\"They seemed pretty fine. In a way, happy.\\" Although all four teens involved in the murder were drug addicts, they were not high before they murdered Sweeney. In response to a detective's question about whether they were high during the killing, Domenic Coia answered, \\"No, I was as sober as I am now. It is sick, isn't it?\\" A detective involved in the case and a forensic psychologist later opined that the killers' motivation went beyond robbery and stemmed from envy and resentment of Sweeney's relative success in life. In his memoir, Domenic Coia gave a different account of the murder. He stated that he did not take the concept of the murder seriously and believed Batzig and Nicholas Coia were not seriously going to hurt Sweeney. He was unaware of Nicholas's contempt for Sweeney's success and the fact that Sweeney's father apparently considered him a \\"slacker\\" adding to his rage was Nicholas's ex girlfriend aborting their child without his consent. Domenic claimed he panicked when Batzig actually hit Sweeney and only participated when he feared him and his brother getting caught. He also denies stating he was sober during the attack and states he later prevented them from killing Justina Morley as they feared she would testify. He also denies involvement in any plans for the murder before the day it happened. Justina Morley Justina Morley claimed that she started smoking marijuana at the age of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting cocaine. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists at the age of 10. Morley had been hospitalized for threatening suicide and self-mutilation in 2002. She was once admitted to Friends Hospital for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she had penned, on her door. Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley had also been expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown. A psychiatrist hired by the defense team, William Russell, said the reason Morley began sexual activity at an early age \\"was an attempt at validation of self-worth\\". Morley testified that she had sex with both Nicholas Coia and Batzig in exchange for heroin just a few days before they murdered Sweeney. Trial Justina Morley's attorneys explained to the judge that the girl had suffered through depression, suicide attempts and substance abuse in order to get her a juvenile court trial. Psychiatrist William Russell explained to the court how Morley attempted suicide twice by overdosing on pills only the year before the killing. Morley's attorney argued she was the least culpable and if tried as a juvenile, she could get treatment and live a productive life. The Assistant District Attorney argued that Morley was an important part of the plot in Sweeney's murder and she had treatment before, to no avail. If tried in a juvenile court, Morley could have been free of court supervision by the age of 21. The judge agreed with the prosecution and ordered her to be tried as an adult for murder. At that point, Morley pleaded guilty to third-degree murder in exchange for her testimony against other defendants, and was sentenced to 17 1/2 to 35 years in prison. As of September 2019, she is still in prison. Domenic Coia, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr. were charged with first- degree murder, conspiracy, robbery and possessing an instrument of crime. All were tried together as adults. In 2004, prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty against Batzig and Nicholas Coia, but planned to seek it against Domenic Coia. However, during the trial, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roper v. SimmonsRoper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005). that defendants under the age of 18 could not be executed. As a result, Domenic Coia, who was 14 days away from his 18th birthday at the time of the crime, could not receive the death penalty. Therefore, the Coia brothers and Batzig all faced mandatory life sentences without parole if convicted of first-degree murder. Jailhouse letters of the defendants were read during the trial to understand their behavior and to determine who, if anyone, was the most culpable. Defense counsel for the Coias and Batzig argued that Morley was the instigator and led the boys to commit the murder of Sweeney. In one of her writings to Domenic Coia, she wrote: \\"So you say I'm manipulative, and yes, I believe I am in ways. I'm persuasively manipulative, and I think I'm pretty good at it, too. I enjoy dragging people along.\\" She went on to say: \\"...tell me you don't enjoy these gullible humans. It's funny how easy it is to persuade them into lies.\\" She also wrote to Domenic Coia, \\"I'm a cold-blooded [expletive] death- worshiping bitch who survives by feeding off the weak and lonely. I lure them, and then I crush them.\\" Expressing no remorse at all in one letter, she stated: \\"I am guilty. But I still don't feel guilty for anything... I still enjoy my flashbacks. They give me comfort. I love them.\\" However, Morley testified that she did feel remorse for the slaying of Sweeney and that she only wrote such things so that she would be accepted by the Coias and Batzig. The prosecution, while acknowledging that Morley's letters showed her to be \\"a cold-blooded killer\\", nevertheless used her letters to demonstrate the depravity of the group. The defense attorneys for the Coias and Batzig also contended that their clients, being drug addicts, lacked the intent to kill needed to support a first-degree murder conviction, and at most had committed the lesser crime of third-degree murder. However, this strategy was undermined by the confessions of the three defendants. Assistant District Attorney Jude Conroy read part of Domenic Coia's confession in court: \\"We just kept hitting and hitting him. . . . We took Sweeney's wallet and split up the money, and we partied beyond redemption.\\" Domenic Coia had also told a detective: \\"It was like we were all happy [with] what we did.\\" Verdict and sentencing The Coia brothers and Batzig were convicted on charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy, robbery and possession of an instrument of crime. In May 2005, each one was sentenced to mandatory life in prison without parole for murder, plus 22 1/2 to 45 years for conspiracy, robbery and possessing an instrument of crime. None of the teens showed any remorse or apologized for the murder. Paul Sweeney, the victim's father, addressed Domenic Coia, saying, \\"Look at me, Domenic. I know you think you have evil eyes but mine are going to be staring back at you every night for the rest of your life.\\". Domenic Coia responded to the judge upon asking if he would like to be heard, \\"I never thought I had evil eyes. But other than that, I'm cool.\\" something that would later be misquoted to make him look worse, according to Coia in his memoir, Biological Juvenile. The judge, in denying defense counsel's motion for a sentence that could allow for parole, said: \\"There is a level of inhumanity that exists in these facts. This was a totally depraved act.\\" Resentencing In 2012, the Supreme Court in Miller v. AlabamaMiller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. ____ (2012). struck down mandatory life without parole sentences for juveniles under 18, holding that the court must consider the individual circumstances of each juvenile defendant in determining sentence ‚Äî which might still be life without parole if, in the court's judgment, the circumstances warrant it. The Supreme Court left open the question of whether Miller applied retroactively to trigger resentencing of all juveniles who had already been sentenced, leaving this to the decision of individual state courts and legislatures. In Pennsylvania, where the Coias and Batzig were sentenced, the state supreme court ruled in 2013 not to apply Miller retroactively, thus upholding the mandatory life sentences of juveniles whose sentences were already final at the time of the Supreme Court ruling.Rovner, p. 3. However, the state supreme court also ruled (in a different case) that juveniles sentenced to mandatory life without parole whose sentences were not yet final at the time of Miller were entitled to a resentencing hearing considering their individual circumstances, at which they could receive a sentence of life without parole, or life with the possibility of parole after a minimum term. Batzig and Nicholas Coia, who both had appeals pending at the time of Miller, were granted such resentencing hearings.Commonwealth v. Coia, No. 35 EAL 2010 (Pa. 2013) (per curiam).Commonwealth v. Batzig, No. 131 EAL 2010 (Pa. 2013) (per curiam). At Nicholas Coia's resentencing hearing on February 19, 2015, Common Pleas Judge Sandy L. V. Byrd sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole, upholding the original 2005 sentence. Byrd noted, \\"This is an uncommon case, there are no factors which remove the defendant from the punishment of life in prison without parole,\\" Byrd said. \\"Not only did he plan the assault, but he participated in the assault which was so violent that Jason Sweeney had to be identified with dental records.\\" Memorial foundation Paul and Dawn Sweeney, Jason Sweeney's parents, set up the Jason Keel Sweeney Foundation, in memory of their son, to fund a full scholarship for the Valley Forge Military School, the school of their son's dreams. Jason Sweeney had wanted to attend the military school to become a Navy SEAL. He had been accepted into the school, but could not afford the tuition. In popular culture A 2003 episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation entitled \\"Coming of Rage\\" (Season 4, Episode 10) is loosely based on the crime. The crime inspired comic artist Kevin Colden's 2008 graphic novel Fishtown, which was nominated for an Eisner Award. A 2012, episode of the Lifetime Movie Network series Killer Kids entitled \\"Foul Ball and Framed\\" detailed the murder, including actual footage from the crime scene, in the second segment of the episode (\\"Framed\\"). In 2013, convicted murderer Domenic Coia wrote a memoir of his life and the murder, entitled Biological Juvenile. It was subsequently posted in PDF form on the website prisonsfoundation.org. In the memoir, he actually does express remorse for his actions, explains why he didn't apologize during the final trial, criticizes the law system in the USA, gives full context of what he did say at the trial and to detectives, and apologizes to both his family and the Sweeney family. An episode of Murder Among Friends, titled '\\"Friend Fatale,\\" on Investigation Discovery profiled the murder of Jason Sweeney on May 17, 2016, less than two weeks before the 13th anniversary of Sweeney's death.

Her mother married Carl Gustav Sundstrom in 1912; Thelma attended Fort Street Girls' High School before graduating from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Arts in 1928. She subsequently taught at Meriden School and travelled abroad. She married grazier Richard Falkner Harvey on 20 June 1934 at St Philip's Church of England in Sydney and settled on his property near Ivanhoe, where she joined the Country Women's Association. Her husband died in 1946; the following year she stood as the Country Party candidate for the seat of Dubbo in the state election. Thelma Harvey was one of the first women endorsed by the Country Party to contest an election in Australia. She also contested the 1953 Gwydir by-election. She married Kenneth Kirkby, a Country Party executive member, on 8 December 1949 at St John's Church of England in Darlinghurst; the couple lived at Bellata near Moree, and were divorced. Kirkby continued to contest elections for the Country Party but was not elected. She represented New South Wales at the Associated Country Women of the World conference in Toronto in 1953, and continued to be active in the community. A committee member of the Freedom from Hunger Campaign, she was the New South Wales representative to the United Nations Association of Australia International Weomn's Year committee. On 12 June 1958 she married Jeff Bate, the Liberal member for Macarthur in the Australian House of Representatives, who farmed at Tilba Tilba. They divorced in 1968. Bate was honorary secretary (1957-59) and president (1959-62) of the CWA, when she became known for her strong support of the inclusion of Aboriginal women in the CWA.

Originally developed by David Wade Chambers in 1983, the main purpose was to learn at what age the well known stereotypic image of the scientist first appeared. Following the simple prompt, \\"Draw a scientist\\", 4807 primary school children in three countries completed drawings. The drawings were then analyzed for seven standard indicators: lab coat, eyeglasses, facial hair, symbols of research, symbols of knowledge, products of science (technology) and relevant captions. From these indicators, Chambers was able to show that children began to develop stereotypical views of scientists from a very early age, with a progressively larger number of indicators appearing as the grades progress. History Chambers‚Äô original 1983 DAST, based on surveys conducted between 1966 and 1977, differs significantly, in both purpose and methodology, from the earlier Draw-A-Person and Draw-A-Man projective tests (such as Florence Goodenough in 1926; Harris, 1963; Goodenow, 1977 ), which have been used as a measure of intellectual maturation, to elicit personality type and unconscious material, and as part of neuropsychologic tests for stroke victims. Chambers, rather, was responding to important essays by Margaret Mead and Rhoda Metraux, which identified typical stereotypical images of scientists in high school students, and D. C. Beardslee and D. D. O'Dowd, which was a careful examination of the college student image of the scientist. Over the next 3 decades, several hundred researchers, mainly in the discipline of education, have used the Chambers DAST to gauge various social, cultural and educational factors in student perception of science and the scientist. Some of these variables are discussed below. Kevin D. Finson published an extensive review of the DAST literature. Specific disciplines and related professions Since the publication of the DAST, several different scientific disciplines have been studied simply by changing the prompt from \\"Draw a scientist\\" to \\"Draw a ...\\" These include such professions as engineer, chemist, archeologist, psychologist, mathematician, physicist, doctor, (Schibeci & Sorensen, 1982; Hill, 1991; Warren, 1990; Flick, 1990), Ethnicity and country Draw a Scientist Test (Chambers, 1983) Chambers 1983 survey included children's images in French and English Canada, Australia and the United States along with a single set of drawings from the People's Republic of China. Schibeci and Sorensen (1983) used the DAST for a study of elementary children in Australia, reporting that the media, primarily television, contributed significantly to reinforcement of the stereotypical image.Schibeci, R. A., & Sorenson, I. (1983) Elementary school children‚Äôs perceptions of scientists. School Science and Mathematics She (1995) administered a modified DAST to Taiwanese students (grades 1 to 8) including an analysis of how those images may be influenced by science textbooks currently in use in Taiwan. Earlier studies conducted by She showed Taiwan students held very similar stereotypical images of scientists as those in the West. Fung (2002) administered the DAST to Hong Kong Chinese students comparing primary and secondary school student‚Äôs images. A study of primary students in Ireland (Maoldomhnaigh & Hunt, 1989) revealed that not a single male student drew a female scientist and that only 23 out of 45 female students drew female scientists. Song & Kim (1999) reported that in their study of Korean students, 74 percent described their scientist as male and only 16 percent as female. Buldu (2006) administered DAST to children aged 5‚Äì8 years. None of the 24 boys drew female scientists and 5 of 13 girls drew female scientists. Sj√∏berg (2002) reported on images of scientists in 21 countries. Michalak (2013) reported that when Korean students were asked to depict their perception of a scientist/science from East Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, a hierarchy of time, resources and awareness immediately emerged, some regions held in much lower estimation to others. The list of countries where the DAST has been administered (and findings have been reported in scientific journals referenced) includes French and English Canada, United StatesChristidou, V., Bonoti, F., & Kontopoulou, A.

Methodological A range of methodological variations of the original DAST have been developed. The Draw-a-Scientist-Test Revised Prompt (DAST-R) was recommended and tested by David Symington and Heather Spurling (1990). They pointed out that students seemed to be drawing what they perceived to be the public stereotype of a scientist, and not necessarily their own perception. To remedy this problem, Symington and Spurling tested the effect of a revised prompt, \\"Do a drawing which tells what you know about scientists and their work.\\" They compared drawings done by children given both sets of prompts. The drawings showed enough differences that these researchers concluded their report with a recommendation that the DAST prompt be critically examined for what it was actually asking the students to draw. Finson, Beaver, and Cramond (1995) developed the Draw-A-Scientist Checklist (DAST-C) a revised list of indicators based mainly on those first noted in the Chambers' DAST. Several researchers have raised other methodological issues. Jarvis & Rennie (1995) thought that the use of drawings without words could represent an abstract idea the observer may be unable to comprehend. They suggested that children be asked to add sentences or annotate their drawings to improve interpretation. Losh, Wilke & Pop (2008) felt that analysis of the DAST is weakened by asking children to draw ‚Äòonly scientists‚Äô, suggesting that it is unlikely children view scientists as different from other professionals especially in absence of comparison across occupations. Maoldomhnaigh & Hunt (1989) reported that when they asked their subjects to draw two pictures of scientists the frequency of appearance of mythic stereotypes changed from one set of representations to the other leading them to conclude that students might have more than one definition of the word ‚Äúscientist‚Äù. Maoldomhnaigh & Mholain (1990) cautioned that greater care be taken in the standardization of task directions provided to children since different wording could produce differences in the drawings. Chambers responded to these objections by pointing out that, although revised prompts may be very useful in relation to certain revised research objectives, the aims of the original study were well served by using the simplest of prompts to avoid confusion and possible inadvertent signaling to the children of 'what was expected'. Also, since the DAST was first designed to discover at what age the well-known stereotype first appeared, the use of words was not really appropriate when dealing with younger children of limited verbal capacity. Finally, Chambers believed the use of a standardized prompt was desirable to ensure that different studies, across cultures and across time, remain comparable. (Chambers, 1996) Gender Female scientist from Chambers (1983) The single most widely studied variable in DAST research has been that of gender. Mead and Metraux (1957) noted that when asked to write essays about scientists, both male and female high school students mostly described male scientists. In the original DAST study, out of nearly 5,000 students tested, 28 girls, and no boys, drew female scientists. (See also Schibeci and Sorenson, 1984; Kelly 1985). To a greater or lesser degree, almost all the hundreds of DAST studies observed this gender divide, as indicated in a recent review of the DAST literature. > \\"A survey of students from across the United States found that only 14 > percent of the drawings by girls and 8 percent of the drawings by boys > depicted female scientists, and only 20 of the 1,600 drawings by both girls > and boys depicted scientists of color (Fort and Varney 1989). A study of > undergraduate biology and liberal studies majors showed that students in > both groups drew more male scientists than female scientists, and only > female students from both groups drew female scientists (Rosenthal 1993). > Another study found that children in kindergarten through twelfth grade > primarily drew pictures of male scientists (Barman 1999), and older students > were less likely to draw female scientists than were younger > students.\\"Steinke, Jocelyn; Maria Knight Lapinski; Nikki Crocker; Aletta > Zietsman-Thomas; Yaschica Williams; Stephanie Higdon Evergreen and Sarvani > Kuchibhotla (2007) \\"Assessing Media Influences on Middle School Aged > Children's Perceptions of Women in Science Using the Draw-A-Scientist Test > (DAST)\\" Science Communication 29(35). Another account from 2009 is typical of the gender analysis found in the interpretation of DAST drawings: > \\"Females more than males drew their scientist in a laboratory setting with > symbols of knowledge such as books, charts, etc. It is also not surprising > that males tended to draw their scientist as a male while females drew both > male and female scientists. More females drew their scientists with > eyeglasses than did the males. However more males drew their scientists as > males with symbols of technology and mythical stereotypes. Overall gender > analysis confirms a predominantly ‚Äúmanly‚Äù image of a scientist irrespective > of the country from which the student hails from.\\" (Narayan, 2009) Stereotypes and negative attitudes to science Another 1983 example A direct connection between stereotypic images and negative attitudes to science is difficult to establish. In several studies over the next three decades (Smith & Erb, 1986; NSTA, 1992; NSTA, 1993; and Odell, Hewett, Bowman, & Boone, 1993) evidence indicated that negative stereotypes of science and scientists led to negative perceptions, which, in classrooms, led to negative attitudes toward science. At the same time, since scientific stereotypes are by no means exclusively negative, the lessons to be learned for science teaching are more complex. In any case, Chambers pointed out that most adults, even many scientists, utilize the standard indicators to convey graphically the concept ‚Äúscientist‚Äù. References Further reading * Barman, C.R.

She was held down for nine hours by Elizabeth and beaten dozens of times by Kevin on the back of her body, causing massive tissue damage according to Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey. She was being disciplined for apparently mispronouncing a word. She died in hospital on February 6, 2010. Her sister Zariah, 11 years old, was also beaten for \\"being a liar and a bad influence on the 7-year-old.\\" Zariah was hospitalized in critical condition with severe injuries but she survived.  Trial  The District Attorney points to a book written by a Tennessee Evangelist named Michael Pearl, who the Schatz's have told police they were following. Investigators say the Schatz's practiced a similar form of corporal punishment on their six biological children and were training their oldest daughter in the proper way to deliver spankings. Pearl's Web site, www.nogreaterjoy.org, suggests \\"A swift whack with the plastic tubing would sting but not bruise. Give ten licks at a time, more if the child resists.\\" Kevin Schatz was found guilty of second degree murder and torture and was sentenced to serve at least 22 years of imprisonment from two life sentences. Elizabeth Schatz was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and infliction of unlawful corporal punishment and was sentenced to serve at least 13 years of imprisonment.http://whynottrainachild.com/2011/06/10/schatz-sentenced-to- prison/ See also *Adoption in the United States *Child discipline *Corporal punishment *Corporal punishment in the home *Domestic violence *List of murdered American children References Category:2010 murders in the United States Category:Child abuse resulting in death Category:Murdered American children Category:American torture victims Category:Whipping Category:Crimes in California Category:2010 in California ","title":"Death of Lydia Schatz"},{"id":"32483230","text":"√âric N'Gapeth (born July 17, 1959 in Douala, Cameroon) is a French former volleyball player and coach who competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics.sports reference Retrieved 21 July 2011Nord √âclair, l'actualit√© N'Gapeth, le volley de p√®re en fils 27 oct. 2009 \\"Tours ne peut que se f√©liciter d'√™tre all√© chercher √âric N'Gapeth l'an dernier.

Biography Page one of a manuscript entitled 'Historical narrative of an attempt to form a settlement in New Zealand' by Baron de Thierry. De Thierry was from a French family that had fled to England following the revolution. He claimed to have been born in 1793 while his parents were fleeing, probably in Grave in the Netherlands. Upon reaching England, his father Charles Antoine de Thierry, claimed the title of Baron Nasher. De Thierry was enrolled at Magdalen College, Oxford, and claimed to have transferred to a college of the University of Cambridge. There, he met Hongi Hika, the NgƒÅpuhi chief who was visiting England, and the missionary Thomas Kendall. De Thierry subsequently arranged a purchase of at Hokianga, in Northland, through Kendall while at Cambridge. The land was bought for the price of about 500 muskets plus powder and ball which de Thierry sent to Sydney, Australia. Hongi Hika uplifted the weapons on his return to Sydney. It was this act that ignited the inter-iwi and inter-hapu Musket Wars in New Zealand, which continued until about 1842. After travels in North America and the Caribbean, de Thierry came to the Pacific in 1835. In the Marquesas Islands, he announced himself King of Nuku Hiva and wrote to James Busby, the British Resident in New Zealand, of his intentions to land there and establish himself as \\"sovereign chief\\". His kingdom would embrace free trade and medicine, and share its \\"occasional bounties\\" with local chiefs. In Sydney 1837 he recruited some locals to join his adventure, but when he arrived in the Hokianga, rangatira (chiefs) TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene and Eruera Maihi Patuone repudiated his claims. He was allowed to settle at a smaller, 800 acre plot by Nene and Te Taonui. The settlement was a failure, however, as de Thierry's followers rioted and abandoned him, and he was dependent on MƒÅori charity. Despite his failures, he continued to exaggerate his successes to France and agitate for the establishment of a French colony led by himself. Any possibility of this was finally curtailed with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. De Thierry subsequently moved to Auckland, where he worked as a piano teacher until his sudden death on 8 July 1864.

Born in South Brisbane to Hungarian tailor Julius Isack (known as Isack Julius) and his Romanian-born wife Ernestina, n√©e Lang, he was raised a non-orthodox Jew and attended Leichhardt Street State School, winning a scholarship to Brisbane Grammar School in 1929. He attended the University of Queensland from 1934, gaining a Bachelor of Arts in 1938 and a Bachelor of Law in 1940. He was secretary of the Radical Club from 1937 to 1938 and edited the Student Union's paper, Semper Floreat, in 1938. He joined the Communist Party of Australia in 1936. Julius was involved in socialist theatrical productions in the 1930s and he co-founded the Eureka Youth League in 1940 with Connie Healy. In 1941 his application to join the Queensland Bar was blocked due to his communism; he took the matter to court with Fred Paterson as his counsel. The judge found in his favour and he was admitted to the bar on 29 June. He was nevertheless shunned by much of the legal community but stayed solvent by charging a token fee. He married Kate Doreen Gillham on 22 October 1943 at Brisbane (they divorced in 1962). In 1948 Julius was sentenced to three months' gaol for not paying fines resulting from his involvement in the St Patrick's Day march, but he was released after two weeks when widespread sympathy led an anonymous donor (rumoured to be the Hanlon Labor government) to pay his fine. He was a frequent candidate for elections, and it was his preferences that decided the seat of Moreton in the 1961 federal election in favour of the Liberal James Killen, allowing Robert Menzies to retain government. Julius was involved in the legal case regarding Menzies' attempted dissolution of the Communist Party in 1950-51, and in 1954-55 he cross-examined the Petrovs at the royal commission on espionage. He was also a supporter of the peace movement and Aboriginal rights. On 16 February 1960, under financial difficulties, he had himself removed from the roll of barristers and became a solicitor. Julius died at Princess Alexandra Hospital in South Brisbane on 27 February 1963 of myocardial infarction and was cremated.

Clancy was born at Redfern in Sydney to grocer Denis Edward Clancy and Olive, n√©e Kitchen. He attended St Peter's De La Salle School in Surry Hills, leaving at the age of 14 to work in a boot pattern factory. He was briefly apprenticed in the printing industry before working in a battery factory. He played with rugby league with the junior Balmain Tigers in 1936 and was also an amateur boxer. In 1937, he won 22s 6d in a professional fight at Leichhardt, which allowed him to afford a fare to Port Kembla where he was apprenticed as a bricklayer. The 1938-39 dispute over exporting pig-iron to Japan, and the 1940 strike, raised his political awareness. On 10 August 1940, he married machinist Alma May Thomas at St Francis Xavier's Catholic Church in Wollongong. Clancy joined the United Operative Bricklayers' Trade Union Society in 1941 and was elected to the committee in 1942. He became secretary of the South Coast district council of the Building Workers' Industrial Union (BWIU) in February 1943. After studying Marxism with the intention of converting his socialist wife to Catholicism, he became a Marxist himself and joined the Communist Party of Australia in 1943. He was also elected to the Labor Council of New South Wales, becoming a vice- president. After his election as a state organiser of the BWIU in 1944, Clancy moved to Revesby, and continued his involvement in the Communist Party. He became assistant secretary of the BWIU in 1947 and secretary in 1953, ultimately rising to become federal secretary in 1973. He was a building group representative on the Australian Council of Trade Unions' executive from 1970 to 1973 and 1975 to 1979. He retired as federal secretary in 1985 and became honorary chair of the union's international department. He had become completely blind in 1980 as a result of diabetes. Clancy contested numerous elections for the Communist Party, and was on the central committee executive during the 1968 split after the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia. He resigned from the party in 1971, and in December of that year became president of the new Socialist Party of Australia. Disagreement among members led to his removal and resignation from the party in 1983. Attempting to reunite the far left, he formed the Association for Communist Unity in 1984. Clancy's interest in classical music saw him serve from 1973 to 1978 as the trade union representative on the board of the Australian Opera, and he was a passionate supporter of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. He was awarded the Order of People's Friendship by the Soviet Union in 1979 and was included on the New South Wales Labor Council's list of leading unionists in 1980. He died of a heart attack in 1987, at Mumbai in India, while returning from a peace conference in Mongolia.

Photography Friel was a painter for many years before turning to photography in 2006, since when he has not painted. This change in medium coincided with his leaving London to live on a beach in Whitstable, Kent. He has talked about the importance of the Kent countryside and coast to his work. His early photographic work was shot in black and white. The reason he has given for this is that he is partially colour blind and \\"did not feel confident enough to shoot landscapes with the correct colour balance\\". However, since 2009 most of his prolific output has been in colour. He is quoted as saying that he usually shoots 1000 images a day.Tom Sutherland, \\"Chris Friel interview\\", interview page, Frontview Gallery. Accessed 25 July 2011. He has cited his early influences as the Russian photographer Alexey Titarenko, the Canadian impressionist landscape photographer Frank Grisdale and the British painter Kurt Jackson; and other influences as James Wainwright, Peter Scammell, Toshihiro Oshima, and Luis Montemeyer; while Tim Parkin has noted the influence of Fay Godwin, Bill Brandt and Harry Callahan. All of his photographs are produced using digital cameras and a combination of tilt-shift lenses, long exposure photography and intentional camera movement ‚Äì the movement of the camera over the course of the exposure. He has said \\"My aversion to sitting in front of computers means that I do minimal post production on images\\". His photographs have been exhibited widely including at the South Bank Centre London, on the Santiago subway in Chile, and projected behind the London Sinfonietta in the Royal Festival Hall, and Mikhail Palinchak has described him as \\"one of the finest contemporary landscape photographers in the uk today\\".. (This post is uncredited, but a whois search for the domain name reveals that it is owned by Palinchak.) He was shortlisted for The Sunday Times' Landscape Photographer of the Year for the last four years, and won a judge's choice award in 2011. In 2011 Friel published Moving Pictures, a collection of 80 of his abstract colour landscape photos with an essay by the Canadian art critic Ann Marie Simard. 2011 also saw Friel collaborating with Matthew Herbert on the artwork for his album one pig.

She is a descendant of Emperor Alexander II of Russia and of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Family A psychiatrist, Clotilde is the only child of Count George von Merenberg (1897‚Äì1965) and Elisabeth M√ºller-Uri (1903-1963). She is the last patrilineal descendant of the House of Nassau, the male line of which ruled the Duchy of Nassau until 1866, provided a 12th-century German king, a line of Princes of Orange who served first as stadholders of the United Dutch Provinces and, from 1815 to 1948, as kings of the Netherlands, and reigned as grand dukes of Luxembourg until 1968. Neither she, however, nor her father or paternal grandfather were deemed full members of the Nassau dynasty, the last member of which, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, died in 1985.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, F√ºrstliche H√§user XVI. \\"Luxemburg\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 2001, pp. 80-81. German. While Countess Clothilde's branch of the family had legitimate male members until 1965, they had been bypassed for Luxembourg's throne since 1907. The Counts von Merenberg descend legitimately from the morganatic marriage in 1868 of Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau and Natalia Pushkina, an untitled member of the lower Russian nobility, a daughter of the renowned poet Alexander Pushkin. Although their son, Count George von Merenberg married Princess Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya, a daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, and pressed for recognition as heir presumptive to the Luxembourgeois throne as its grand ducal line approached extinction, a 1907 law of the grandduchy dismissed the Merenbergs' claim to the throne. Prince Nikolaus was a great-grandson of Charles Christian, 3rd Prince of Nassau- Weilburg, who in 1760 married Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, a daughter of the Dutch stadholder William IV, Prince of Orange and Anne, Princess Royal of Great Britain. Countess Clotilde is also a great-granddaughter of the Russian Emperor Alexander II.  Marriage and children  In 1965, she married Junker Enno von Rintelen (9 November 1921, Berlin-Charlottenburg - 16 October 2013), a gynecologist, son of Junker Viktor von Rintelen (1887‚Äì1954) and Antonie Bracht (1893-1922). He was a grandson of Wilhelm von Rintelen, a prussian Lieutenant general ennobled in 1913 by German Emperor Wilhelm II. Clotilde and Enno have three sons: * Alexander Enno von Rintelen (born Wiesbaden, 23 March 1966). * Georg Nicolaus von Rintelen (born Wiesbaden, 29 June 1970) He married on 30 June 2007 Olivia Minninger (born Cologne, 27 August 1969), daughter of G√ºnther Minninger and Monika Kleineberg.

It provides services in the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of numerous Environment Agency - European Waste Catalogue , Retrieved 2011-07-22 waste streams from 27 locations throughout the UK.CSG Operating Centres, Retrieved 2011-07-22 In July 2018, CSG were named as the 58th-largest privately-owned company, based in the Solent region.  History  Edgar 'Bunny' Hart founded Hampshire Cleansing Service in 1934, having purchased a Dennis tanker from Wokingham Rural District Council for ¬£5 and acquired an operator‚Äôs licence to empty cesspits. He opened a depot at Botley, Hampshire (which the company still uses today) and quickly expanded the business, becoming a contractor for several local councils. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Hart had six tankers on the road, specialising in domestic sewage and night soil collections from septic tanks, cesspits and cesspools.CSG History, Retrieved 2011-07-22 Wartime brought with it several opportunities for HCS. Sewage removal work was classified as an essential war service, which meant the company was not affected by conscription of its workers or subjected to fuel rationing. Furthermore, a number of army camps became established in the region, increasing the amount of sewage which needed to be transported and the sewage itself was in greater demand, as a more economic alternative to fertilisers. At its peak wartime operation, the company‚Äôs fleet had risen to 20 tankers and 15 bucket collection vehicles and its workforce to 100. After the war, the company grew through diversification and wider geographical spread. Hampshire Cleansing Service changed its name in 1954, to become Cleansing Services (Southern Counties) Ltd. A veteran of the First World War, Bunny Hart was keenly opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and supported the annual Aldermaston Marches of the late 1950s and early 1960s by cleaning waste from the marches at cost price. The 1960s saw further growth, with the establishment of a tank-cleaning division and numerous competitor acquisitions leading to the company becoming described as the Cleansing Services Group, a name which survives today as CSG. Also during the sixties, CSG became pioneers in the South with the Front End Loader ‚Äì a tool now common place within the waste industry. In 1971, Bunny Hart died, after a long illness, expressing a firm wish that the company should remain owned and controlled by the Hart family. In accordance with his wishes, his eldest daughter, Heather, was appointed as his successor. On 24 February 1972, an event took place which was to define the very future of the waste industry ‚Äì an event in which CSG played a central role. 36 drums of sodium cyanide ash were found, dumped near a children‚Äôs playground in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. A CSG subsidiary was called in to remove the drums. The following day, as the incident was being debated in Parliament, the material was being safely processed at CSG‚Äôs Botley headquarters. The fact that a major loss of life had been so narrowly avoided forced the Government to examine rogue tipping practices that were prevalent in the UK waste industry at the time. Within weeks, the Government passed the Disposal of Poisonous Waste Act (1972), which became the precursor to much of today‚Äôs UK Hazardous waste legislation. In the intervening years, CSG have continues to diversify, through acquisition and natural expansion, in order to exploit the opportunities brought about by the increasing legislation of waste management.  Operations  CSG operate a number of different facilities across a variety of sites across the UK, across a number of sectors of the waste industry. In addition to domestic sewage handling and other wet waste operations, CSG now operate their own sewage treatment plant in Worcester. A number of hazardous waste streams are treated at their site at Cadishead, near Manchester, with waste oil being treated and processed at a number of locations around the UK. CSG operate a printing materials recycling plant in Dorset and even a waste oil collection vessel, the Erimus Star, based on the Tees at Middlesbrough.  Corporate Social Responsibility  Since Bunny Hart‚Äôs assistance to the Aldermaston Marches in the 1950s, CSG have always sought to be involved in a number of initiatives that seek to benefit the communities in which they operate. Funds and Management time are donated to a wide range of activities, including the Bourne Community Farm in Salisbury, Wiltshire, a number of amateur and junior sports teams and a Trust dedicated to improving the IT skills of nearby residents. The Margaret Hart Trust Since 1976, CSG has operated a trust in the name of Bunny Hart‚Äôs wife. The trust was designed to provide assistance to retired employees or any current or former employee financially disadvantaged by health problems. It‚Äôs believed to be a unique feature of a privately-owned company of CSG‚Äôs size.  Other Activities  In 2013, CSG launched SepticTanksAndCesspits.com; a dedicated sewage clearance booking website which enables customers to get an instant online quote and book a tanker to empty their septic tank, cesspit or sewage treatment plant. CSG was the subject of Waste Matters: A History of Cleansing Service Group (), a 2002 book by Nigel Watson, examining the history of the company. The text was updated in 2017, entitled The Hart of Waste (). CSG have interests in a broad range of activities across the waste sector. In 2008, CSG acquired J&G; Environmental, the largest print waste company in the UK and a major recycler of aluminium. In 2015, the group acquired Willacy Oil Services, specialists for many years in industrial cleaning, oil refinery services and the manufacture of specialist automated tank cleaning equipment, along with the Oilmonster waste oil collection brand.  Awards  In 2010, Cleansing Service Group ranked 24th in The Sunday Times Profit Track 100 listing which ranks the UK's top 100 private firms with the fastest growing profits.

Cameron was born at Warracknabeal to farmer Finlay Cameron (later a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly) and Victoria May Cameron, n√©e Marshman. He attended Brim East State and Warracknabeal High schools before entering the public service as a taxation clerk on 7 March 1938. He studied from 1938 to 1939 at the University of Melbourne. Cameron joined the militia forces (citizens) in December 1937. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 3 November 1939, being posted to the 2/5th Battalion. He was sent to the Middle East in April 1940 and trained in Cairo until his commission as a lieutenant on 30 March 1941. He was put in command of anti-aircraft defences on the transport ship City of London, which evacuated his battalion from Greece, in April, and then served as a platoon commander in Syria in June and July. Cameron's battalion left the Middle East in March 1942, returning to Australia in August before being sent to Papua in October. In January 1943 the 2/5th was transported to Wau, New Guinea, and Cameron's platoon captured a ridge from the Japanese during the advance to Crystal Creek, earning Cameron the Military Cross. He was promoted captain in March. Cameron was wounded in July leading an attack on Mount Tambu, and did not return to his battalion until February 1944, by which time they had returned to Queensland. Cameron married Daphne Alice Grayling, a schoolteacher, on 29 July that year at the Methodist Church in Kaniva, Victoria. In November 1944 Cameron's battalion was sent to Aitape; on 3 January 1945 Cameron's company was sent to clear an enemy ridge. Cameron's inspiring capture and defence of the position earned him a Bar to his Military Cross. When he returned to Australia in October he was assigned to the Directorate of Recruiting and Demobilization at Army Headquarters in Melbourne, and his appointment was terminated on 28 July 1948. Cameron established a sheep farm at Dunkeld after the war and became active in the Victorian Farmers' Union. He contested four Legislative Council elections for the Country Party from 1964 to 1976, and stood as an independent Country candidate in several federal contests. In 1986, he died suddenly of myocardial infarction at his farm, two weeks prior to a planned trip overseas back to Egypt & Europe.

One of the best-known inns in southeast England, it was established in the 12th century and has a long, turbulent history. The current building dates from 1420 and has 16th-century additions in the Tudor style, but cellars built in 1156 survive. The inn has a strong connection with the notorious Hawkhurst Gang of smugglers, who used it in the 1730s and 1740s as one of their strongholds: Rye was a thriving port during this period. Some of the smugglers, their mistresses and other characters are reported to haunt the inn. The AA Rosette- winning restaurant serves British and French cuisine and features medieval- style artwork in the interior by the Slade School of Fine Art. It has been owned by Judith Blincow since 1993. Geography The Mermaid Inn is located on Mermaid Street, which was once the town's main road. Mermaid street of present day, must have been the Middle street of 1670. Middle Street used to include the present Mermaid and Middle streets; in fact, the original Middle street was the present Mermaid street, as the Mermaid Inn is described as abutting on the south towards that street. The inn is situated on the north side of Mermaid street, and abutted to Middle Street towards the south. Other close-by establishments, which were also used by the Hawkhurst Gang, included the London Trader Inn, the Flushing Inn, and the Olde Bell Inn. History Passage leading to the courtyard Early years The cellars of the Mermaid Inn date from 1156, believed to be the year that the original inn was built, or shortly afterwards: Nikolaus Pevsner and English Heritage identified them as 13th-century. In its original form, the building was constructed of wattle and daub, lath and plaster. It was a notable alehouse during medieval times, brewing its own ale and charging a penny a night for lodging. The inn became popular with sailors who came to the port of Rye, and the port also provided ships for the Cinque Ports Fleet. In the 1420s, the inn was rebuilt but retained its cellars. It underwent further renovation in the 16th century, much of which remains today. Catholic priests who had fled from Continental Europe escaping from the Reformation during 1530 stayed in the inn, which is testified by (Jesus Homnium Salvator) inscribed in the oak-panelled \\"Syn's Lounge\\". Between 1550 and 1570, the Town Corporation organised many functions such as the \\"Sessions Dinner\\", the \\"Gentlemens Freeman's Dinner\\", \\"Mayoring Day\\" and the \\"Herring Feast\\". Queen Elizabeth I was also a guest at the inn around this time. The inn had a strong connection with the notorious Hawkhurst Gang which used the premises during the 1730s and 1740s. This large group of smugglers controlled territory from Kent to Dorset from their base at the Oak and Ivy Inn in Hawkhurst, but they used the Mermaid Inn as a secondary location. There are a myriad of secret tunnels, including one which ran from the cellars to the Old Bell Inn (built 1390) in The Mint, a street which runs parallel to the north of Mermaid Street. A revolving cupboard at the end of the tunnel in the Olde Bell would then be used by the gang for a quick getaway. A resident of Rye remembered the smugglers as; \\"when the Hawkhurst Gang were at the height of their pride and insolence having seen them (after successfully running a cargo of goods on the seashore), seated at the windows of this house (the Mermaid) carousing and smoking their pipes, with their loaded pistols lying on the table before them; no magistrate daring to interfere with them\\". By 1770, the building ceased functioning as an inn. By 1847, it was in use as a house and was owned by Charles Poile; the yard at the back, through which there was a footway leading to High Street, was called the Mermaid Yard. Later years The inn functioned as a club in 1913, after it came under the ownership of May Aldington, mother of the novelist Richard Aldington. It was then a popular locale for many artists like Dame Ellen Terry, Lord Alfred Douglas (Oscar Wilde's \\"Bosie\\"), A.C. and E.F. Benson and Rupert Brooke. In 1945, during World War II, the inn functioned as a garrison for Canadian officers. It was later purchased by Mr L. Wilson, a Canadian, who had been garrisoned there. The Mermaid Inn had the honour of hosting a luncheon to Her Majesty the Queen Mother when she was named as the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports during her visit to Rye in 1982. Under the name Mermaid House and The Mermaid Hotel, the Mermaid Inn was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 12 October 1951. This defines it as a \\"particularly important\\" building of \\"more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 75 Grade II* listed buildings, and 2,106 listed buildings of all grades, in Rother‚Äîthe local government district in which Rye is located. The Mermaid Inn is presently owned by Judith Blincow and Robert Pinwill, who bought it in 1993. In late 1982, the exterior of the inn was used in the post Monty Python film Yellowbeard, alongside its neighboring church square and infamous cobbled Mermaid Street leading to the inn. The film turned out to be Marty Feldman's last ever project, after he died in Mexico during production. Architecture and fittings The black and white timber-framed and tiled building, with dark oak and carved stone chimney pieces, was constructed in the mid-15th century; the author of Old Sussex Inns identifies 1426 as the date. Some of the timber was taken from ships that had been broken up. The south-facing elevation, the oldest section apart from the cellars, has a five- window range to the upper storey and attic space above. The upper storey is jettied, and the section to the west extends over the entrance to the inner courtyard and former stable area. This overhang is supported on wooden columns with brackets and cross-beams. The north-facing section, beyond courtyard, is also timber-framed but with brick facing and infilling. It rises to two storeys with two windows on each and a dormer above. This, and the east and west ranges, are 16th- and 18th-century. The tiled roof has one gable end. The chimney is made of Caen stone and embellished with decorations. The secret passages that existed in the inn have now been converted into fireplaces. The Giant's Fireplace Bar features an inglenook fireplace which is supported by a beam that traverses the room. Other low panelled rooms, contain large Tudor fireplaces and dog grates (a freestanding basket grate intended to hold wood for the fireplace). Monogram, names and dates are carved on the stone fireplaces, including \\"1643\\", \\"1646\\", and \\"Loffelholtz\\". Some of the chairs are elaborately carved and were made from ships' timbers. There are 31 rooms, each of different design, spread over several floors. Eight bedrooms have 4-poster beds. The bathrooms are fitted with modern amenities. The ceiling has thick and dark teak wood beams while the windows are made of lead frames. Diamond-paned windows are situated at the back. The floors creak. Haunting Entrance hall Dining room The Mermaid Inn is well known for its hauntings and has been subject to an investigation by Most Haunted. The events in one room have been described as \\"one of the most well-organised ghostly scenarios anywhere\\". * Room 1 (James) is said to be haunted by a lady in white or grey who sits in the chair by the fireplace. Guests have reported waking up in the morning and finding their clothes on the chair wet, despite no windows or pipework being near the chair. * Room 10 (Fleur de Lys) is said to be haunted by the ghost of a man who has terrified guests by walking through the bathroom wall into the main room. * Room 16 (Elizabethan) was said to be the scene of a duel involving two men \\"of unknown date and origin\\" (although they have also been described as wearing \\"16th-century clothing\\"). After fighting through some of the nearby rooms, one of the men was killed, dragged into the adjacent room and thrown through a trapdoor into the dungeon below. Many unexplained light anomalies have been recorded in the middle of the night. On one occasion an employee was tending to the fireplace when all of the bottles on the bottle shelf at the other end of the room fell off; the experience caused him to resign. The ghost of a maid is said to be present in the inn; she was the girlfriend of one of the smugglers of the Hawkhurst Gang and was killed by his fellow gang members as they feared she knew too much and would expose them. * Room 17 (Kingsmill) is named after Thomas Kingsmill, a Hawkhurst smuggler who inhabited the inn. It is said to be haunted by the ghost of a woman who was said to be the wife of the Hawkhurst gang founder George Gray. She was said to haunt a rocking chair in the room; guests would wake up in the middle of the night and see the chair rocking on its own, and found the room icy cold. The chair was eventually removed from the premises because it caused so many disturbances with guests. * Room 19 (Hawkhurst) is said to be haunted by a gentleman in old-fashioned clothes. One American guest reported seeing him sitting at the end of her bed: in terror, she spent the night in the adjacent room with a mattress pulled around her head. Judith Blincow, who owns the inn and has worked there since 1980, states, \\"Although I have not personally seen ghosts, I certainly have met some very convinced and frightened guests.\\" References Notes Bibliography    External links *Official site *Reviews: TripAdvisor The Times Beer In The Evening Category:Hotels in East Sussex Category:Pubs in East Sussex Category:Tudor architecture Category:1156 establishments in England Category:Grade II* listed buildings in East Sussex Category:Rye, East Sussex Category:Reportedly haunted locations in South East England Category:East Sussex folklore Category:Grade II* listed pubs in England Category:Timber framed pubs in England ","title":"The Mermaid Inn, Rye"},{"id":"32483595","text":"The R√≠o Grande (Spanish for \\"great river\\") is a river located on the island of Tierra del Fuego.

Born Isabel Frances Swann on 1 June 1881 in Temora, she was the daughter of English-born schoolteacher William Swann and Elizabeth, n√©e Devlin. Isabel was registered as a dentist on 20 June 1902 and began practising at Parramatta; by 1912 she had an address on Liverpool Street. Brought up in a pacifist family, her patients included Miles Franklin, Jennie Scott Griffiths, and others, and she joined the Australian Freedom League in 1912. She was a militant anti-conscriptionist who was disappointed with the attitude taken by Rose Scott and her supporters, who Swann saw as advocating war in the name of defence. In the late 1910s Swann was a speaker at Socialist Sunday Schools and became involved in a number of controversial causes, including opposition to saluting the flag in schools and the Howard Prison Reform League. A correspondent of Henry Holland, she claimed partial responsibility for ending indentured labour in Fiji as part of the Anglo- Indian committee. She hid New Guinean natives in Sydney until their shipboard conditions improved and represented the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom at the Australian Peace Alliance conference in 1921. On 23 August 1924 she married William Longworth, a grinder, at Randwick; they would have one daughter Isabel Jean. The family moved to Wyong in 1932 where they attempted to grow passionfruit commercially, and then to Newcastle in 1936. She helped organise a peace conference with the Christian Socialist Movement, where she argued against fascism. A supporter of the Soviet Union, Longworth unsuccessfully contested the House of Representatives seats of Newcastle (1946) and Shortland (1949) as an Independent Scientific Socialist. At the age of 78, she was recognised as the longest-practising dentist in Australia. Longworth died on 13 January 1961 at Newcastle and was cremated with Congregational forms.

A grid-connected PV system consists of solar panels, one or several inverters, a power conditioning unit and grid connection equipment. They range from small residential and commercial rooftop systems to large utility-scale solar power stations. Unlike stand-alone power systems, a grid-connected system rarely includes an integrated battery solution, as they are still very expensive. When conditions are right, the grid-connected PV system supplies the excess power, beyond consumption by the connected load, to the utility grid. Operation Photovoltaic power station at Nellis Air Force Base, United States Residential, grid-connected rooftop systems which have a capacity more than 10 kilowatts can meet the load of most consumers. They can feed excess power to the grid where it is consumed by other users. The feedback is done through a meter to monitor power transferred. Photovoltaic wattage may be less than average consumption, in which case the consumer will continue to purchase grid energy, but a lesser amount than previously. If photovoltaic wattage substantially exceeds average consumption, the energy produced by the panels will be much in excess of the demand. In this case, the excess power can yield revenue by selling it to the grid. Depending on their agreement with their local grid energy company, the consumer only needs to pay the cost of electricity consumed less the value of electricity generated. This will be a negative number if more electricity is generated than consumed. Additionally, in some cases, cash incentives are paid from the grid operator to the consumer. Connection of the photovoltaic power system can be done only through an interconnection agreement between the consumer and the utility company. The agreement details the various safety standards to be followed during the connection. Features Electric power from photovoltaic panels must be converted to alternating current by a power inverter if it is intended for delivery to a power grid. The inverter sits between the solar array and the grid, and may be a large stand-alone unit or may be a collection of small inverters attached to individual solar panels as an AC module. The inverter must monitor grid voltage, waveform, and frequency. The inverter must detect failure of the grid supply and must not supply power to the grid. An inverter connected to a malfunctioning power line will automatically disconnect in accordance with safety rules, which vary by jurisdiction. The location of the fault current plays a crucial part in deciding whether the protection mechanism of the inverter will kick in, especially for low and medium electricity supply network. A protection system must ensure proper operation for faults external to the inverter on the supply network. The inverter must be designed to synchronize its AC frequency with the grid, to ensure correct direction of power flow. Anti-islanding Diagram of a residential grid-connected PV system Islanding is the condition in which a distributed generator continues to power a location even though power from the electric utility grid is no longer present. Islanding can be dangerous to utility workers, who may not realize that a circuit is still powered, even though there is no power from the electrical grid. For that reason, distributed generators must detect islanding and immediately stop producing power; this is referred to as anti-islanding. In the case of a utility blackout in a grid-connected PV system, the solar panels will continue to deliver power as long as the sun is shining. In this case, the supply line becomes an \\"island\\" with power surrounded by a \\"sea\\" of unpowered lines. For this reason, solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have automatic anti-islanding circuitry in them. In intentional islanding, the generator disconnects from the grid, and forces the distributed generator to power the local circuit. This is often used as a power backup system for buildings that normally sell their power to the grid. There are two types of anti-islanding control techniques: * Passive: The voltage and/or the frequency change during the grid failure is measured and a positive feedback loop is employed to push the voltage and/or the frequency further away from its nominal value. Frequency or voltage may not change if the load matches very well with the inverter output or the load has a very high quality factor (reactive to real power ratio). So there exists some Non Detection Zone (NDZ). * Active: This method employs injecting some error in frequency or voltage. When grid fails, the error accumulates and pushes the voltage and/or frequency beyond the acceptable range. Advantages * Systems such as Net Metering and Feed-in Tariff which are offered by some system operators, can offset a customers electricity usage costs. In some locations though, grid technologies cannot cope with distributed generation feeding into the grid, so the export of surplus electricity is not possible and that surplus is earthed. * Grid-connected PV systems are comparatively easier to install as they do not require a battery system. * Grid interconnection of photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems has the advantage of effective utilization of generated power because there are no storage losses involved. * A photovoltaic power system is carbon negative over its lifespan, as any energy produced over and above that to build the panel initially offsets the need for burning fossil fuels. Even though the sun doesn't always shine, any installation gives a reasonably predictable average reduction in carbon consumption. Disadvantages * Grid-connected PV can cause issues with voltage regulation. The traditional grid operates under the assumption of one- way, or radial, flow. But electricity injected into the grid increases voltage, and can drive levels outside the acceptable bandwidth of ¬±5%. * Grid- connected PV can compromise power quality. PV‚Äôs intermittent nature means rapid changes in voltage. This not only wears out voltage regulators due to frequent adjusting, but also can result in voltage flicker. * Connecting to the grid poses many protection-related challenges. In addition to islanding, as mentioned above, too high levels of grid-connected PV result in problems like relay desensitization, nuisance tripping, interference with automatic reclosers, and ferroresonance.

In addition to Balcon and Setton, members included Kenneth Shipman, John Bryan, Tony Richardson, Julian Wintle and Ronald Neame. Alliance Films, Denham Laboratories and Lloyds Bank were also investors. Producer-investors were meant to \\"vet\\" each other's scripts.

In November 1961 the company announced it would go into co-production with Seven Arts Productions, to make Sammy Going South and Tom Jones. Bryanston distributed several films made by Woodfall Film Productions but refused to produce Tom Jones (1963) in colour, the success of which could have established the company for a long time.p.222 Barr United Artists stepped in to finance the film instead.

Plot After celebrating his 29th and - as everyone including himself knows - last birthday, James, a young man terminally ill with cancer, sets out on a last hiking trip with his three best friends, Davy, Bill and Miles. Their destination is James's favourite beach at Barafundle Bay, on the Pembrokeshire coast. Davy is a kind, loyal and responsible soul who has been unemployed and helping James's family take care of him for quite a while already. Bill is boisterous and fun-loving, and everybody hopes he is finally getting around to breaking up with his oppressive girlfriend. Miles, lately absent from James's life, is a handsome intellectual turned into a businessman and the son of a successful novelist who died, also of cancer, when Miles was a child. James's and Miles's friendship used to be very close and has always bordered on rivalry, particularly as aspiring writers. James is too weak to walk much any more, so he mostly sits in a special cart and needs a lot of very practical and physical help from his companions, in addition to liquid morphine and other medications at increasing frequency to manage his chronic pain and other symptoms. Having been ill for years already, he seems to be at peace with his rapidly approaching death and takes childlike delight in everything this last journey has to offer. However, his failing strength and increasing discomfort and outright pain also bring out his bitterness in the knowledge that his life will be over before he ever had time to make anything much of it. Traveling over the rugged and isolated coastal terrain, the young men fool around having light-hearted, juvenile fun to give James the time of his life. They also encounter various odd persons and situations and are faced with a series of setbacks and accidents, including loss of various supplies and finally the cart. Everyone's nerves and patience are sorely tested by James's outbursts at each of his friends in turn: out partly of premeditation and partly of spontaneous pain-induced anger, he seems to attempt to shake them out of mediocrity, settling for things and excessive unselfishness and into making what they actually want out of the lives they still have ahead. Davy is mortified by James's observations; Bill reveals that his girlfriend is pregnant and while he knows that they are not right for each other, he can't and won't leave her; Miles counters James's attacks with equally brutal honesty regarding James himself. Eventually James and Miles come to reveal the guilty secrets each has kept from the other. James found and read a novel manuscript Miles finished years ago without ever telling anyone, and has been jealous ever since but also impressed by Miles's talent. Miles has kept away from James lately because he has been unable and unwilling to cope with his best friend's illness, but he is in love and sleeping with James's married sister, and she and her children will soon come to live with Miles ‚Äì something he did not intend James ever to know. On the night they finally arrive at Barafundle Bay, James reveals the true purpose of the trip: he plans to drown himself in the sea before pain takes his life over completely. He asks his friends to let him do so and tell his family and the police that they woke up in the morning and found his body in the water. Horrified at the thought, they refuse; however, after temporarily losing James's morphine supply and witnessing him struggle with severe pain, they change their minds. In the morning, James swims out with his friends keeping him company, and eventually Miles helps James drown himself near the shore and brings his body back.

Shand was born in Drummoyne in Sydney to accountant James Shand (later a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly) and Ann, n√©e Donald. Shand attended Epping Public, Cleveland Street Intermediate High and Burwood Commercial schools, and studied at Sydney Technical College while employed by a wool firm. He worked on properties near Armidale before becoming a wool and skin buyer. On 24 May 1927 he married Evelyn Wigan, n√©e Hawkins, formerly Hyde, a twice-widowed 48-year- old, at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church in Sydney. They settled near Armidale at Woodville, a 4000-acre property. Shand converted the heavily wooded area of his property into agricultural land, selling wood to Armidale residents, and managed to survive the Great Depression by long and hard work. His reputation grew and by 1939 he was known for cultivation of soy beans, peas, chrysanthemums (for pyrethrum) and opium poppies (for morphine). He ran as one of several Country Party candidates for the House of Representatives seat of New England in 1940 and 1949, but was not successful. During World War II he organised mass production of primary products by co-operating with other landholders and using women to work the land. In 1947 Shand became the founding chairman of East-West Airlines, which flew between Tamworth and Sydney, as well as other routes. The airline was also used for agricultural purposes, spreading superphosphate, seeding and crop dusting, for example. Trans-Australian Airlines was a related company, but Shand resisted pressure from the Commonwealth Government and Senator Shane Paltridge to accept a takeover from Ansett. Routes to Maroochydore and Alice Springs were added in the early 1970s. Shand had been appointed to a new crops advisory body by the government during World War II, and by smuggling grains of hybrid maize from the United States he expanded on Australia's existing commercial industry. Appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1976, Shand was able to exploit the plummet in beef prices in the early 1970s with his new crops. Shand's first wife died in 1951; he married another 48-year-old widow, Beryl Constance Downe, n√©e Coventry, on 24 May 1952 at St Paul's Church in Armidale.

Information from hydrocarbon exploration demonstrates that the area is underlain by a series of active thrust faults and related folds, some of which have been detected from anomalous drainage patterns. These blind thrust faults are roughly west-northwest‚Äìeast-southeast- trending, parallel to the mountain front, and dip shallowly towards the south- southwest. The 1570 earthquake has been linked to movement on the outermost and northernmost of these thrusts. Ferrara The city Ferrara is located on the Emilian side of the Po Valley, an alluvial plain geologically quite stable since the Messinian age (7-5 mya). Small earthquakes are common, albeit not frequent, but rarely lead to considerable damage to the urban cityscape. Ferrara was the location for minor earthquakes in the four centuries before 1570, these events being recorded in the city archives with detailed descriptions of damage to buildings and depositions by witnesses. At the time of the 1570 event, it was a medium-sized city, with 32,000 inhabitants. Despite continuous ‚Äì and often victorious ‚Äì wars against the age's superpowers, the nearby Venice and the Papal States, Ferrara in the 16th century was a thriving city, a major hub for trade, business and liberal arts. World class music and painting schools, linked with Flemish artistic communities, were established in the late 15th and early 16th century, under the patronage of the House of Este. Musical instrument workshops, and especially the making of lutes, were a pride of the city and were considered preeminent. A new part of the city, named Addizione Erculea (Erculean Addition) had been built in the previous century: it is commonly considered one of the major examples of urban planning in the Renaissance, the biggest and most architecturally advanced town expansion project in Europe at the time. Political, economical and religious situation Alfonso II d'Este, by Girolamo da Carpi (Museo del Prado, Madrid) In 1570 the city was held by Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, vassal of Pope Pius V, a beloved ruler and a devoted liberal art patron, but careless and a big spender as an administrator. Alfonso was the main sponsor of many artists including Torquato Tasso, Giovanni Battista Guarini, Luzzasco Luzzaschi and Cesare Cremonini, confirming the reputation of Ferrara as a haven for artists and freethinkers. The emerging of the city as a cultural powerhouse came at the cost of a sharp increase in taxes. The city was a safe refuge for Jews and converts from the persistent prosecutions promoted by the Roman Catholic Church. Despite Alfonso II's formal status as a vassal of the Holy Seat, he never took any action against the two thousand Jews living in the city walls, well knowing that the Hebrew community accounted for a strong share of the city cultural and economic success. His disregard of the Holy Seat's orders made him more than one enemy. Even if he was walking on a thin line, Alfonso managed to avoid the Papacy's many diplomatic and legal challenges to the city independence, thanks to cunning politics and a strong friendship with the powerful Charles IX of France. It is to be remembered that Alfonso II was the son of Ren√©e of France, member of the House of Valois, declared heretic and guilty of housing John Calvin himself under the eyes of the Catholics. Alfonso was not new to compromises: to smooth his frequent brushes with the Pope, he was usually attending masses and acting as a good Catholic in public, receiving communion, giving substantial sums to charity, arranging religious parades for saints and building convents. Both the high taxation, and the soft stance with the Jews ultimately gained him hostility in the most die-hard Catholic part of the population, which supported an acquisition of the city and its lands by the Holy Seat. Those rebel fringes were instrumental in the political struggle following the disaster. The earthquake Book by Michael Manger (1570) Precursor events and main shock Earthquake lights were seen above the city on November 15, 1570, the night before the first quake. Flames were reported to come out from the soil and raise into the air, probably small pockets of natural gas set free by cracks in the earth crust. The earthquake struck at dawn: three strong shocks hit the city in the first day; one ‚Äì the strongest ‚Äì the day after. The first strong shock struck at 9.30 (local time) November 16, 1570, its epicenter just a few kilometers under the city centre. Six hundred pieces of stone masonry (mostly battlements, balconies and chimneys) are reported to have fallen, further damaging the flimsy stone and hay roofs. The following day the ground trembled again many times. At 8 pm a new powerful shock caused severe damage to walls and caused some buildings to sustain structural damage. Just four hours later, a new tremor caused new cracks and some collapse. At 3 am on November 17 the ground shook harder than ever; many buildings, damaged by the previous shocks, gave way and caved in. Many churches' facades, often built as self-standing walls rising well over the effective architecture, collapsed, including at the Duomo. Forty percent of the city buildings were damaged, including almost every public building. Some of them collapsed, and many churches sustained critical damage to pillars and main walls. Observers reported that the shallow bowl-shaped valley where Ferrara lies seemed to rise into a kind of hump, before coming back to its original profile. Damage to the city were assessed in over 300,000 scudi, a huge sum at the time. The event was a surprise to many scholars, since according to the then mainstream theory of natural philosophy, earthquakes were not meant to strike in winter or on flat land. Minor earthquakes had struck Ferrara in the past (events were recorded in 1222, 1504, 1511 and 1561, some of them causing little damage, and a stronger event in 1346). The exceptional length of the seismic swarm, unprecedented at the time in Ferrara, led some to believe it was a supernatural phenomenon. The earthquake's intensity has been assessed as VIII on the Mercalli intensity scale: only the 1346 event was similar in intensity, though minor urbanization led to less evident damage (but more victims), the other have been all marked as class VII or VI. Other seismic events would hit the city in 1695, 1787 (three shocks in ten days) and 1796. Initial damage evaluation Giovanni Battista Tinti, St. Francis Solanus shows 1570 earthquake to St. John the Apostle and St. John the Baptist (Municipal pinacotheca of Cento) Palaces and public buildings Castello Estense, seat of the Duke, received major damage and became unfit for use. The Palazzo della Ragione (town hall) partially collapsed, as did the enclosure walls of both Loggia dei Banchieri and Loggia dei Callegari, in front of the Dome. Palazzo Vescovile (the Bishop's Palace) was destroyed, and had to be rebuilt. Minor damage was inflicted on the Cardinal Palace, Palazzo del Paradiso, Palazzo Tassoni and Duke Alfonso's personal palace. Churches Damage to churches was widespread. San Paolo and S. Giovanni Battista churches collapsed, many paintings with them. Facades of S.Francesco, S.Andrea, Santa Maria in Vado, S.Domenico, and Santa Maria della Consolazione churches were severely damaged or destroyed, as was the Charterhouse's. The Santa Maria degli Angeli church, still under constructions, was so severely damaged that further work was abandoned. Other than the facade, the Duomo lost the Corpus Domini chapel and part of a side wing: the heavy iron chain above the main altar fell to the ground, along with the columns' fine marble capitals. San Paolo church had to be rebuilt from scratch. Towers Many towers, a common kind of architecture in the Italian city skyline in the renaissance, were damaged. The Castle's bell tower collapsed to the ground, as did the top portion of the other three major towers of the town: Palazzo della Ragione's, the Porta S. Pietro donjon and Castel Tealdo tower. The Steeples of the Duomo, of S.Silvestro, S.Agostino, S.Giorgio and S.Bartolo churches were severely damaged. Further shocks The seismic wave kept going for four years, but the worst was over after about six months. Just one month after the earthquake, on December 15, 1570 a new powerful shock hit the city: this time the battered Palazzo Tassoni, S.Andrea church and S.Agostino church were not spared. On the following January 12, 1571 a new shock damaged Palazzo Montecuccoli. Victims Despite the widespread damage, fatalities were quite limited. The initial shocks alerted the population, and gave them time to evacuate the damaged buildings. The majority of houses were of one or two story height, and received less severe damage than the grander palaces and churches. Reliable sources, such as historian Cesare Nubilonio, estimate 40 victims, while Azariah dei Rossi and Giovanni Battista Guarini both place the estimate at 70. Other sources vary from 9 dead to over 100, with some other occurrences of estimates of the order of two hundred or five hundred, usually taken as unreliable. Florence's ambassador Canigiani is known to have written home about 130 to 150 victims. City evacuation Ferrara destroyed by 1570 earthquake, by H. J. Helden The poor and the wealthy People were scared by the disaster and about a third of the populace left the city for good. City jails collapsed and prisoners escaped the rubble, leading to a crime spree in the city and countryside. The palaces of the notables and courtesans were damaged as well as the poorest mansions, and the whole city population had to seek shelter together in tents and refuges, despite their status or wealth. Contemporary account estimate eleven thousand people left the city. The townspeople remained refugees for the following two years, due to the aftershocks. The resulting situation, in which societal rules were upset or fell in disuse, was perceived as awkward and unnatural by both peasants and well-to-do, leading to common psychological issues amongst the population. Along with the fear of aftershocks, people developed a sense of impending doom, precariousness and a general mistrust in humanity. The country court Duke Alfonso II d'Este and his family barely escaped the collapse of a tower of Castello Estense. The lord fled the city by coach, and set up a temporary court in the fields of the San Benedetto garden near the city along with his closest advisor. This unusual improvisation was not well regarded by the Pope and was seen as demeaning by other rulers, but ultimately it proved to be a wise choice and a necessity in view of the duration of the aftershocks. Ferrara's fate appeared sealed to the ambassadors visiting the refugee Duke: in correspondence between the embassies and the nobles, the region is sometimes called \\"di Val di Po dov'era Ferrara\\" (Po Valley, where Ferrara once stood). Florence's ambassadors were especially skeptical about the chances of city recovery. Political struggle about the rebuilding Announcement in a 1570 German woodcut broadside of Ferrara earthquake and Florence burning The Pope's stance The Duke asked Pope Pius V for help, or at least a public blessing to the city: he receiving nothing but a firm reprimand for not having prosecuted enough the city's Jews, well deserving God's wrath toward the city. Alfonso II's answer was prompt, pointing out the evident natural cause of the disaster and discharging any allegation about blaming the Jews. The Pope's rebuttal was a blunt political maneuver, meant to undermine Alfonso's authority by exploiting the discontented minorities: it stated that since the city administration tolerated the presence of the assassins of Jesus Christ, then God was justifiably angry toward the whole city. Full blame was to be put on Alfonso's part, not on the Jews, for failing to expel them from the city walls. Jewish city scholar Azariah dei Rossi wrote a short essay on the earthquake in the following days, named Kol Elohim: in the account, he credited the earthquake to a visit from God himself, suggesting it was a supernatural event but not implying any punishment toward the city or its Jews. Scaring the population Along with the Pope's stern letter, emissaries from the Capuchins were sent to the town from Bologna, in order to scare the populace and turn it against Alfonso. The friars took some decomposing corpses from the rubble, and brought them in procession claiming that God was going to sink the city to hell if the people refused to drive Alfonso away. The macabre show further contributed to the widespread sense of doom and distrust: people living in one of the most free and culturally lively cities of Italy suddenly was cast into a gloomy atmosphere of superstition and religious obscurantism. The Duke's reaction Bothered by the Capuchins' show, annoyed by the Pope's political maneuvers and worried about the loss of hope of the citizens, the Duke decided to display his strength by forcibly expelling the rabble-rousing friars from the city, abandoning any expectation of papal help and unilaterally taking in his hands the control of the city rebuilding. He walked in procession through the debris, followed by his most trustworthy men, to show off to the populace his control on the city, its laws and its people. The Duke made every effort to have the Castello Estense repaired in record time, to downplay his hardnesses with the other Italian rulers and to begin to restore a sense of normality in the evacuees. Relationships with the Papacy remained strained, but Alfonso always managed to keep the Pope's demands and attacks at bay. Return into the city and rebuilding efforts After Castello Estense was made safe again, thanks to many iron rods and anchors, in March 1571 the Duke triumphantly relocated back to the city and the return to normality begun to look possible. Minor shocks kept coming, but the city was ready for rebuilding. Immediately Duke Alfonso ordered a census of the remaining population, and on August 14, 1571 issued a decree ordering the Ferraresi to come back to the city. Return was mandatory for people living in the city for at least 15 years (that is, people with full citizenship rights), under penalty of seizing of their estates. Despite the order, only about two out of three came back to the city: among the people who left the city were many of the wealthiest and a good portion of the court nobles ‚Äì further diminishing the prestige of Alfonso II. At first rebuilding works begun on the Duomo and on S.Michele, S.Romano and Santa Maria in Vado churches, overseen by Cardinal Maremonti. According to Guarini, works on S.Rocco, S.Silvestro, S.Stefano, S.Cristoforo, S.Francesco and the rebuilding of S.Paolo begun shortly after, the latter being completed in 1575. Damage to buildings was so widespread ‚Äì chronicles reports that all the public building and most of the houses needed work ‚Äì that the forging of the much needed iron bars caused a shortage of metal in the whole province, depleting stockpiles and requiring massive imports from nearby cities. The earthquake observatory Del terremoto, dialogo del signor Lucio Maggio gentil'huomo bolognese (1571) Founding of the observatory Alfonso called on his court scholars in physics, philosophers and many \\"experts in various accidents\\" to inquire into the causes of the disaster, appointing as their leader the renowned Neapolitan architect Pirro Ligorio (a successor of Michelangelo as head of the San Pietro in Vaticano workshop), effectively founding the first seismological observatory and think tank on earthquakes in the world. The study group wrote six treatises in the following year: four of them were published and quickly became regarded as masterpieces among that part of natural philosophy dedicated to the study of earthquakes, their reputation lasting through the following two centuries. The essays were essential in disproving emerging theories that blamed the earthquake on the drainage of the many Duchy's swamps and their reclamation as fertile agricultural lands. One of the leading theories at the time was that earthquakes were caused by subterranean winds, excited by change in temperature. The winds should have escaped through the marshes, but drainage compromised the process so the winds grew in pressure and caused shocks. Ligorio's work on building safety Project for earthquake-resistant structures by Pirro Ligorio Pirro Ligorio was a scientist and a devout catholic: he needed to carefully weigh his words to avoid a clash with the Curia while at the same time proving that the Pope's claims were unfounded. He collected a long list of earthquakes of the past, compiling a time-line and showing how they were a common and natural occurrence in many parts of the known world. He kept a diary of the aftershock, writing in abundance of detail about their intensity and the damage they kept doing to the city, dramatically improving knowledge of shocks dynamics and consequences of an earthquake. Ultimately, Ligorio put the blame for the extensive damage on inappropriate techniques and bad materials used in building the city's edifices. The random mixing of stones, brick and sand in the main walls was strongly criticized, along with the rooftops built to push horizontally on the side walls (instead of providing a vertical load). Approximation in leveling of walls and ceilings led to uneven discharge of forces. In the last part of his treatise, Rimedi contra terremoti per la sicurezza degli edifici (Remedies against earthquakes for building security), Ligorio presented design plans for a shock-proof building, the first known design with a scientific anti-seismic approach. Many of the empirical findings of Ligorio are consistent with contemporary anti-seismic practices: among them the correct dimensioning of main walls, use of better and stronger bricks as well as elastic structural joints and iron rods. Following years Loss of independence Late in 1571, Alfonso II was called to fight against the Ottoman Empire fleet in the Battle of Lepanto. While the Duke was away, the Pope executed a thorough purge of the Jews from the Papal States, including Ferrara. The only allowed ghettoes were established in Rome and Ancona. Pope Pius V died the following year. After the earthquake, many nobles and well-off merchants left the city, managing their business in their country villas or moving their houses to nearby towns. Ferrara lost its capital city status and was demoted to a simple border city squeezed between Venice and the Papal States, never fully achieving economic recovery from the disaster. Without the Jews' businesses, crushed by costly reconstruction debts and losing its thriving cultural circle, the city became a minor trade and agricultural hub up until the 19th century. In 1598, Alfonso died without legitimate heirs, and the city was formally annexed to the Papal States by means of questionable claims of vacancy. The annexation of Ferrara and Comacchio was disputed by many contemporaries, including the weak Duke of Modena Cesare d'Este who was the direct candidate to the succession, but was ultimately completed. Permanent damage The city's architecture still bears many marks from the earthquake. Iron braces and rods placed in the aftermath of the shocks to strengthen the damaged walls are still present, windows closed with stones and concrete to improve the stability of damaged facades are a common occurrence and there are traces of the stubs once sustaining collapsed balconies and porches. Chimneys, decorated battlements and terraces were damaged or destroyed, and were rebuilt in the following decade in a changed style and materials. Walls from historical buildings are often uneven and out of angle. This is sometimes said by locals to provoke the special Ferrara feeling to visitors, a veiled sense of dizziness and disorientation.

Avron later garnered recognition for his production work by receiving a Grammy Award nomination for Sara Bareilles' single \\"King of Anything\\" under the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance category. Avron is noted for having particular recording techniques, believing that pre-production is essential before entering a recording studio. When recording, he prefers to lay down the drums and rhythm guitar first, as opposed to the conventional method of bass guitar and drums. Avron has noted, \\"Over the years I've had issues with recording bass first, especially when someone is hitting the strings really hard. For me it's difficult to tell whether the bass is in tune, because the fundamental is so low. When laying the rhythm guitars down first, it's much easier to tell whether the bass is out of tune or not. It also means that the bass has a place to fit.\\" Discography Selected discography (producer/mixing/engineering). *1997 ‚Äì So Much for the Afterglow by Everclear *2000 ‚Äì Songs from an American Movie Vol. One: Learning How to Smile by Everclear *2000 ‚Äì New Found Glory by New Found Glory *2001 ‚Äì Transmatic by Transmatic *2002 ‚Äì Back to the Innocence by Seven and the Sun *2002 ‚Äì Sticks and Stones by New Found Glory *2002 ‚Äì Headspace by Pulse Ultra *2002 ‚Äì Tomorrow by SR-71 *2003 ‚Äì Ocean Avenue by Yellowcard *2003 ‚Äì Die Trying by Die Trying *2004 ‚Äì Catalyst by New Found Glory *2004 ‚Äì Nothing new since Rock 'n' Roll by The Fight *2005 ‚Äì From Under the Cork Tree by Fall Out Boy *2005 ‚Äì Make Believe by Weezer *2006 ‚Äì Lights and Sounds by Yellowcard *2007 ‚Äì Minutes to Midnight by Linkin Park *2007 ‚Äì Empty Walls by Serj Tankian *2007 ‚Äì Infinity on High by Fall Out Boy *2007 ‚Äì Luna Halo by Luna Halo *2007 ‚Äì Paper Walls by Yellowcard *2008 ‚Äì Folie √† Deux by Fall Out Boy *2008 ‚Äì New Surrender by Anberlin *2008 ‚Äì Indestructible by Disturbed *2009 ‚Äì Artwork by The Used *2009 ‚Äì Say Anything by Say Anything *2010 ‚Äì Asylum by Disturbed *2010 ‚Äì A Thousand Suns by Linkin Park *2010 ‚Äì Kaleidoscope Heart by Sara Bareilles *2010 - Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice by HIM *2011 ‚Äì When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes by Yellowcard *2011 ‚Äì Vice Verses by Switchfoot *2011 ‚Äì Radiosurgery by New Found Glory *2012 ‚Äì Southern Air by Yellowcard *2012 ‚Äì Don't Panic by All Time Low *2013 ‚Äì J.A.C.K. by Forever The Sickest Kids *2013 ‚Äì Exhale EP by Stardog Champion *2014 ‚Äì Cavalier Youth by You Me at Six *2014 ‚Äì Fading West by Switchfoot *2014 ‚Äì Lift a Sail by Yellowcard *2014 ‚Äì Talking Is Hard by Walk the Moon *2014 - MALL (Music from the Motion Picture) by Mike Shinoda, Joseph Hahn, Dave Farrell, Chester Bennington, Alec Puro. *2015 ‚Äì Blurryface by Twenty One Pilots *2015 ‚Äì What's Inside: Songs From Waitress by Sara Bareilles *2016 ‚Äì Taking One for the Team by Simple Plan *2016 ‚Äì Waitress by Original Broadway Cast Recording *2016 - Unleashed by Skillet *2016 - Yellowcard by Yellowcard *2016 - Blurryface Live by Twenty One Pilots *2017 - Eternity, in Your Arms by Creeper *2018 - America by Thirty Seconds to Mars References External links  www.nealavron.com Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Record producers from California Category:American rock musicians Category:American keyboardists Category:Musicians from Los Angeles ","title":"Neal Avron"},{"id":"32483856","text":"Kvalserien is the name of round-robin tournaments to qualify for play in ice hockey leagues in Sweden.

Location Dhodial Pheasantry is located on Karakorum Highway in the village of Dhodial, Mansehra District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, from Abbottabad, towards the village of Shinkiari. It covers an area of . The Dhodial campus of Hazara University is located near the facility. History Dhodial Pheasantry was established in 1984 by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife Department with the support of the IUCN and the World Pheasant Association. It was initially set up over an area of . In 2001, when Hazara University planned to expand its campus over , then Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Lt. Gen Iftikhar Hussain Shah ordered the pheasantry to be relocated to the Jaba Sheep Farm. The Inevitable Flight, a documentary film about this issue, was made by a Pakistani Canadian documentary filmmaker, Azfar Rizvi. This brought the issue under public scrutiny. Subsequently, other factors kicked in and mobilized enough public and political support that the relocation was cancelled. Public services An information center has been developed in the aviary to accommodate visitors, facilitate researchers, and spread awareness among local pheasant breeders. More than 500 people visit the aviary daily. The entry fee for the aviary is 10 Pakistani rupees per person. In 2011, the aviary was closed to the public due to the supposed spread of bird flu. By July, all of the birds had been vaccinated and the aviary was opened to the public again on July 5, 2011. Conservation efforts The cheer pheasant, which became extinct in Pakistan, was reintroduced in the region. The World Pheasants Association sent 90 eggs of the species to the Dhodial Pheasantry. Among the eggs which hatched, the mortality was high and remained high till 1995. This situation got better in 1996. In 1997, a parent flock of 40 pairs was raised and eventually reintroduction of the cheer pheasant in Hazara District was carried out.

Foley was born at Mudgee to schoolteacher James Foley and Margaret Mary, n√©e English. He attended Mudgee High School before studying medicine at the University of Sydney, from which he graduated in 1926. He practised first at Strathfield before moving to Glebe, where he worked for the rest of his career. He married Sarah Agnes May Farmer at St Joseph's Catholic Church in Rockdale on 23 November 1932. Foley was a member of the Labor Party, and supported Premier Jack Lang in the 1930s split. He ran unsuccessfully for the state seat of Burwood in 1932 before winning election to Glebe Council in December 1934, serving as mayor in 1937 and 1938. He clashed with Lang and in December 1937 led his own group, the \\"Foley Labor Party\\", which defeated Lang's forces at the municipal elections. In 1938 he ran for the state seat of Glebe for the Industrial Labor Party, which opposed Lang. Foley was convicted in 1938 of misusing council vehicles; he was fined and disqualified from sitting on the council. Lang's second splinter party, the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist) (after 1941 simply Lang Labor), appealed to Foley's anti-communist leanings and he ran federally for West Sydney in 1943 and 1949 and for the state seat of King in 1944, 1947 and 1950. He was elected to Sydney Municipal Council in 1945 for Phillip ward and Glebe Council in 1947; when the two amalgamated, Foley's Lang Labor ticket defeated the official Labor group for the Glebe seats. He resigned from the council in 1950 but served again 1953-56. Foley rejoined the ALP in 1957 and soon gained control of the branch of Glebe North, analogous to the branch he had controlled in the 1930s. He was a councillor on Hornsby Shire Council from 1962 to 1965 and served for the Glebe ward on Leichhardt Municipal Council from 1968 to 1971. Remembered as a socially conservative Catholic in a working-class community, Foley has a park named after him in Glebe. He died at Croydon in 1989 and was buried in Rookwood Cemetery.

Early life and education McLaren was born in Tokyo to Rev. Samuel Gilfillan McLaren M.A., a Scottish missionary, and his wife Marjory. He attended Scotch College, Melbourne, and then the University of Melbourne, from which he received a Bachelor of Medicine in 1906, a Bachelor of Science in 1907 and a Doctorate of Medicine in 1910. He was resident medical officer at the Royal Melbourne Hospital from 1907 to 1908 and in 1909 moved to the Children's Hospital. In 1910, as Australasian chairman of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, he toured Australian and New Zealand universities. Career McLaren married Jessie Reeve, daughter of a missionary and travelling secretary of the Christian Union, on 22 August 1911 at Alma Road Presbyterian Church in St Kilda. They travelled to Korea as missionaries, and McLaren was assistant superintendent and then superintendent of Paton Memorial Hospital in Chinju. In 1917 he enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was medical officer to the Chinese Labour Battalion in France. He was professor of neurology and psychological medicine at Union Christian Medical College, Severance Hospital, in Seoul from 1922 to 1939 before returning to Chinju Hospital in 1940 (he also undertook further study at Vienna in 1929). McLaren revisited Melbourne periodically, lecturing on the relationship between body and mind in 1927, publishing a paper in the Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy in 1928, and lecturing for the Melbourne University Student Christian Movement in 1934. He was a prolific journal contributor on medical issues and also discussed the Shinto shrine issue in religious journals.

Life Troy was born in South Melbourne to Irish marine officer Patrick William Troy and Hilda Winifred, n√©e Ainsworth. The Troys moved to Fremantle, Western Australia, during World War I, and Paddy attended the local Christian Brothers' College. He left school in 1921 to work in various kinds of manual labour until he became a seaman in the State Shipping Service in 1924. The family moved to Geraldton in 1926, where Troy began to take responsibility for the family's welfare as his father's health declined. The Great Depression was a challenging time for Troy, who spent long periods unemployed with only casual work to support his family. He broke with the Catholic Church and the Australian Labor Party, and joined the Communist Party of Australia in 1934. In 1936 he led a strike at the Youanmi gold mine where he worked. He married Mabel Grace Nielsen at St John's Church of England in Fremantle in 1935. Troy was jailed for three months after the banning of the Communist Party in 1940, after which he returned to the marine industry. He was elected an official of the Coastal Dock, Rivers and Harbour Works Union of Workers in 1944, and became secretary in 1948. The union was deregistered by the Court of Arbitration in 1952, and Troy began rebuilding the Maritime Services Union, becoming its secretary.

The film details the personal experiences of five young Western men who were identified in childhood as being tulkus, or reincarnated Tibetan Buddhist masters. For over 700 years tulkus have been sought out as highly revered leaders and teachers of Tibetan Buddhism. Beginning in the 1970s, several tulkus have been identified as having incarnated in the West. These new, Western-born, very modern tulkus lead lives prone to culture clash and identity confusion. Background Gesar Mukpo, who wrote and directed Tulku, was born in 1973, the son of world-renowned Tibetan Buddhist master Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche and his British wife Diana. At the age of three, Mukpo was identified by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche as the reincarnation of the late Shechen Kongtrul Rinpoche (the Jamgon Kongtrul of Shechen), one of his own father's teachers in Tibet.Tulku ‚Äì Q&A; with Director/Writer Gesar MukpoTulku DVD ‚Äì review at Wisdom Books Three-year-old Gesar was then enthroned as a tulku in Berkeley, California. In the film, Mukpo's British mother describes her scandalous marriage to a Tibetan monk, and her vision in a dream of a being who asked to be her son. When Gesar was born and was identified as a tulku, his father believed he could be a great teacher, but did not send him away to a monastery, believing it would separate him from his environment too much. Mukpo, who grew up internationally, and whose father died in 1987, lives an ordinary secular life in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He has a daughter, is separated from his wife, and is a music video director and producer. Aware of the irony of his situation and the ambiguity of his life purpose, in the film he sets out to interview other Western tulkus to see if their disorientation is similar to his own, and to see how each has coped with the unique status of Western-born tulku. Mukpo travels to various locations to interview other young Western tulkus and the significant people in their lives. In the process, he relates his own life story and dilemmas as well. Synopsis Gesar Mukpo begins by interviewing a fellow Canadian, Dylan Henderson, who was the first Caucasian tulku discovered in the West, recognized in 1975 by Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche as the incarnation of one of his teachers. The identification was confirmed by Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa, who requested that Henderson come to the Rumtek Monastery in India for the rest of his life.Shambhala Sun, Volume 2, Issues 2‚Äì6. Nalanda Foundation and Vajradhatu International, 1993. p. 39. Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, however, recommended that he remain in the West. Henderson maintains his Buddhist studies and practices, but without the form and structure present in the East. He has a degree in anthropology and history. In New York City, Mukpo visits his younger half-brother Ashoka Mukpo,Trungpa, Ch√∂gyam and Carolyn Rose Gimian. The Mishap Lineage: Transforming Confusion Into Wisdom.

Chronicles of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche. 2007. Although he has not adopted the life of a Buddhist tulku, he has a thangka wall-hanging portrait of his previous incarnation, Khamyon Rinpoche, in his apartment. Ashoka was enthroned as a tulku in Tibet, and found the experience, as well as the expectations of others, very intense and at times uncomfortable. He feels his path is not to be a teacher, wearing monk's robes, but rather to help others and give back in ways appropriate to his location and culture. Mukpo visits the Tibetan refugee colony of Bir in Northern India, which since the 1950s has welcomed fleeing Tibetans after the Chinese occupation of Tibet. He interviews his mentor Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, with whom he studied in India instead of attending college. Khyentse, who is an award-winning filmmaker (The Cup, Travelers and Magicians) as well as a renowned Buddhist master, speaks eloquently about the development of the tulku system, and also about its flaws and possible failings, especially as Buddhism spreads in the West. Mukpo describes his own internal conflict between his Buddhist side and his Western side, lamenting both the seeming incongruousness of the practice when he became a teen and wanted to fit in, and the pressure and obligation he has felt because he bears the designation of tulku. Mukpo meets a 20-year-old from San Francisco, Wyatt Arnold, who has been studying the Tibetan language in India for the past year. Arnold was identified as a tulku as a young child and enthroned at the age of five.Engler, Steven and Gregory Price Grieve. Historicizing \\"Tradition\\" in the Study of Religion. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p. 355. He was slated to go to India at that time, but his parents decided against it. Arnold speaks about his early memories of his former incarnation, and about his fond memories of his childhood Tibetan Buddhist teacher in the U.S., Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche. Arnold seems youthfully conflicted about his role and task,Hill, Lizzy. \\"Two Worlds for Tulku.\\" The Coast.

This brings back fond memories: When Mukpo was 15, his father died, and his mother sent him there to study with Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche for a year. While in Nepal, Mukpo also interviews Reuben Derksen, who was born in Amsterdam in 1986, raised in Nepal and Bhutan, and recognized as a tulku at the age of 11. Derksen is the most cynical of all the young tulkus Mukpo interviews, having had a largely negative experience at the Tibetan Buddhist monastery in India he lived at for three years following high school. Although he no longer considers himself a Buddhist, he still goes back annually to emcee the weeklong Buddhist ceremony in Bhutan, mainly because his presence makes the people there so happy. Returning home to Halifax and his family, Mukpo reflects upon his life and upon the experiences of the tulkus and teachers he has interviewed. He admits that there are no easy answers to the complications and contradictions of being a Westerner identified as a Tibetan tulku in a modern, rapidly changing world. One compensation to the culture conflict is the meaningful connection formed to beloved teachers, communities, and heritages. Speaking about his fellow Western tulkus, he concludes, \\"There is no certain path for any of us, other than the path of self-discovery.\\" Cast *Gesar Mukpo *Dylan Henderson *Ashoka Mukpo *Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche *Wyatt Arnold *Ogyen Trinley Dorje *Reuben Adrian Derksen *Diana Mukpo Production To fund the film, Gesar Mukpo approached the National Film Board of Canada, as part of the Reel Diversity Competition for emerging filmmakers of colour. According to Mukpo: Tulku took two years to complete, and was shot on location in Nova Scotia, Florida, New York City, India, and Nepal. While Mukpo was filming in Bir, two local Westerners offered to take him and his cameraman paragliding for free, resulting in beautiful aerial shots of Northern India.Interview with Gesar Mukpo at the Atlantic Film Festival The film also features rare archival footage from Tibet, and archival footage and photographs of Tibetan masters such as Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, and Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche.

He writes widely on the history and culture of colonial and modern India, popular and public culture in India (especially cinema), historiography, the politics of world history, the Indian diaspora, global politics, contemporary American politics, the life and thought of Mohandas Gandhi, Hinduism, and the politics of knowledge systems. Lal was born to an Indian foreign service officer in (Delhi)India in 1961.His father‚Äôs constant movement because of diplomatic career ,he grew up in Delhi, Tokyo, Jakarta, and Washington, D.C. In Delhi he attended Springdales School.He spent four years in Tokyo, 1965‚Äì69, but has almost no memory of those years; and it is not until 1987 that he returned to Japan for a short visit, followed by a lengthier stay of four months in Osaka in 1999 when he was a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science at the National Museum of Ethnology (Minpaku).  Academic career  He earned his BA and MA, both in 1982, from the Humanities Center at the Johns Hopkins University and wrote his Master's thesis on Ralph Waldo Emerson and Indian philosophy. Lal then studied cinema in Australia and India on a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship before commencing his graduate studies at the University of Chicago, where he was awarded a PhD with Distinction from the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations in 1992. He was William Kenan Fellow in the Society of Fellows in the Humanities at Columbia University in 1992‚Äì93, and since 1993 has been on the faculty of history at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he also holds a joint appointment in Asian American Studies.  Publication  Lal is the author or editor of fifteen books. His first, The Empire of Knowledge: Culture and Plurality in the Global Economy,(Pluto Press, 2002; expanded Indian edition, Sage Publishers, 2005) argues that nothing has been more effectively, even insidiously, globalised than the knowledge systems of the West. The History of History: Politics and Scholarship in Modern India,(Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2003) is a study of the politics of history-writing in India since the early 19th century; the book also makes an unusual argument, naturally not well received by historians, to the effect that ahistoricity has been one of the most characteristic features of Indian civilisation, at least until the beginning of Muslim dynasties. Unlike colonial writers, however, Lal does not even remotely construe the absence of histories as a lack.Klein, K. L. (2011). From History to Theory.

The book was reviewed widely in the Indian press, and in scholarly journals in India and abroad, and nearly full page excerpts appeared in the Hindustan Times(6 and 26 August 2003) and the Indian Express.(6 August 2003) A new edition of the book, with a fresh foreword, appeared in 2005, and the book is in its sixth impression. Introducing Hinduism, illustrated by Borin van Loon, is Lal's contribution to the \\"Introducing\\" Series; the book has been translated into Spanish, Korean, and Finnish. The book was reissued in 2010 as Introducing Hinduism: A Graphic Guide.(London: Icon Books, 2010) Political Hinduism: The Religious Imagination in Public Spheres (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2009) is a collection of eight essays, but the book is not centrally concerned with the rise of Hindu nationalism as such; rather, it considers what a political Hinduism might be that is not Hindutva. Another of Lal's abiding interests is cinema, and his book on Deewaar, the 1975 blockbuster Hindi-language film with Amitabh Bachchan and some of the most memorable dialogues in Indian film history ‚Äì \\"mere paas ma hain\\" (\\"I have mother\\") ‚Äì was published by HarperCollins in 2011. His co-edited book, Fingerprinting Popular Culture: The Mythic and the Iconic in Indian Cinema, appeared from Oxford University Press (2006). It is one of two books, along with The Future of Knowledge and Culture: A Dictionary for the Twenty-first Century, he has co-edited with Ashis Nandy, arguably India's most prominent intellectual. Lal's engagement with the work of Nandy commenced in the late 1980s, and led eventually to the first serious assessment of Nandy's work, published as Dissenting Knowledges, Open Futures: The Multiple Selves and Strange Destinations of Ashis Nandy.(Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2000) The range of Lal‚Äôs intellectual, cultural and political interests is perhaps best explored in his collection of eight essays, Of Cricket, Guinness and Gandhi: Essays on Indian History and Culture.(Seagull Books, 2003; paperback reprint, Penguin Books, 2005) Writing on cricket, the hijras, popular cinema, Gandhi, the national-security state in India, notions of masculinity, and the obsession with the Guinness Book of Records, Lal argues that there is a tension between the idea of India as a nation-state and the idea of India as a civilisation. How India resolves this tension may well determine the course of India's future. Lal's most recent work is The Oxford Anthology of the Modern Indian City (Oxford, 2013) in two complementary volumes. The anthology draws upon the writings of nearly 100 writers, some of great eminence and some of whom are relatively little known. This is a very personal and yet critical anthology, prefaced by a long introduction, focused on how the city in India has been imagined, and the antinomies it invokes are of day and night, passion and reflection, exclusion and inclusion. The writers represented in it include Nirad Chauduri, Gieve Patel, Premendra Mitra, Nissim Ezekiel, Ananthamurthy, Tagore, Pritish Nandy, Buddhadev Bose, Ravi Dayal, Amitav Ghosh, Daya Pawar, Chandralekha, and Prakash Jadhav, and contemporary intellectuals such as Thomas Blom Hansen, Shiv Viswanathan, Sumanta Banerjee, and Ashis Nandy. 53651197009921?s=19|literature].  Contributions  Lal has been involved in various initiatives designed to enhance South-Asian cultural and political contacts, foster systematic critiques of dominant knowledge systems and the various imperialisms of the West, and suggest more ecumenical futures for all humanity. Prominently among these initiatives is Multiversity, an organisation of activists, scholars, and intellectuals from the Global South that has had four meetings in Penang, Malaysia, since 2002. Lal is the founding editor of the Dissenting Knowledges Pamphlet Series, under which eleven works have appeared so far, and also the Asian Thinkers (Pamphlet Series), launched in 2011. Both series are initiatives of Multiversity and Citizens International. He has also been associated with INCAD (International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development), the Intercultural Institute of Montreal, and the Coalition for an Egalitarian and Pluralistic India (Los Angeles). For some years, Lal wrote a column for the Economic and Political Weekly (Mumbai) published as \\"Letter from America\\". He is an acerbic critic of American foreign policy and many aspects of American society. Lal is equally a critic of Hindu nationalism, and his op-ed piece in the Los Angeles Times, \\"Coming Out From Gandhi's Shadow\\" (19 May 1998), was the first piece in a major American newspaper to sharply criticise India's nuclear explosions.

Macdonald was born at Greenock in Renfrewshire, Scotland, to sawmill foreman Alexander Macdonald and Sybil, n√©e Smith. Young Alex attended Homescroft School, but left at 13 to work in a shipyard. His father had remarried in 1920 following his mother's death in 1916, but the children did not get along well with their stepmother, and Alex and his sister Anna emigrated to Australia in 1925 (there was a delay of almost six weeks in Cape Town following a worldwide seamen's strike). Macdonald, who had come to Australia as part of the \\"Dreadnought\\" scheme, trained at Scheyville for three months before working in the mid-west of New South Wales. He intended to return to Scotland via Western Australia, but reports from his father of high unemployment prompted him to remain. He travelled to Queensland in June 1932 at the height of the Great Depression and took on seasonal work, becoming involved in the unemployed workers movement. He eventually relocated to Brisbane. Macdonald joined the Communist Party of Australia around 1933 and was elected to the state committee in 1936, becoming Brisbane branch secretary in 1937. He stood for both state and federal office several times without success. On 11 August 1939 he married Molly Cassandra Neild, a nurse, at Brisbane. Macdonald worked as an ironworker at the Evans Deakin shipyard and was elected full-time secretary of the Queensland branch of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia (FIA) in 1943. He was also on the interstate executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions from 1949 to 1969, and was a supporter of Bob Hawke. Macdonald was defeated for the secretaryship of the FIA in 1951 but became secretary of the Queensland Trades and Labor Council (TLC) in 1952. A strong negotiator, Macdonald played a significant role in the Queensland meat strike of 1946, the shearers' strike of 1956 and the Mount Isa conflict of 1964-65\\\\. He worked to admit university students to the Trades Hall and in 1968 represented the forty TLC-affiliated unions before the State Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. He died of myocardial infarction at Princess Alexandra Hospital in South Brisbane in 1969, and was cremated. His funeral was attended by thousands of mourners.

Bromham was born in Gobur, Victoria to blacksmith Frederick Bromham and Charlotte, n√©e Bradford. She was educated at Yarck before moving with her family to Western Australia in 1893. She attended school at Fremantle and then became a doctor's receptionist. Her mother died in 1908 and Bromham worked at a drapery shop in Claremont, lodging with the daughters of former Fremantle mayor and temperance campaigner Thomas Smith. By the early 1920s, with the business prospering, she began to engage in social issues, and unsuccessfully contested the 1921 state election. She was president of the West Australian Temperance Alliance and secretary of the Australian Women's Equal Citizenship Federation in 1925 before becoming secretary of the Australian Federation of Women's Societies in 1926. In June 1926 Bromham led the Australian delegation to the International Suffrage Alliance Conference in Paris and then represented Australia at a conference of the British Empire League in London on emigration. She left Perth for Melbourne in January 1934 and further represented her union at conventions and conferences in Stockholm and London. She became general secretary of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1937 and moved to Adelaide, contesting Unley at the 1941 state election. She retired briefly in 1946 before returning to Melbourne in 1947 as general secretary. She retired again at the end of 1949. Following her retirement from the temperance movement, Bromham became involved in the Chinese-Australian Friendship Society, joining a peace delegation to Peking at a time when China was highly unpopular. She continued to support the WCTU but found her Christian Socialist beliefs increasingly at odds with the union's conservative agenda, and returned to Western Australia in 1959. She also campaigned for Aboriginal rights. Bromham died at Brentwood Hospital of bronchopneumonia in 1965 and was cremated.

He composed it in Leipzig for Ratswechsel, the inauguration of a new town council, and first performed it on 30 August 1723. Bach composed the cantata in his first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, about three months after taking office at the end of May 1723. A festive service at the Nikolaikirche was an annual event, celebrating the inauguration of a new town council, always held on the Monday after St. Bartholomew (August 24). The text by an anonymous poet includes psalm verses and an excerpt from Martin Luther's German Te Deum. It is focused on acknowledgement of authority as a gift of God, thanks for past blessings, and prayer for future help. The cantata is structured in nine movements, three of them choral (1, 7, 9), the others alternating arias and recitatives. The orchestra is large and representative, with four trumpets, timpani, two recorders and three oboes, in addition to strings and basso continuo. Bach led the Thomanerchor in the first performance. In 2015 the cantata was performed by the Thomanerchor at the place of its premiere on 12 June, opening the Bachfest and celebrating both the 1000th anniversary of the first recorded mention of Leipzig and the 850th anniversary of the Nikolaikirche.  History and words  Nikolaikirche and market in the 18th century As Thomaskantor, Bach served as music director of Leipzig and had to compose not only for music in the four major churches but also for public municipal functions. The Ratswechsel was celebrated with an annual church service at the Nikolaikirche on the Monday after St. Bartholomew, August 24. It was not a democratic election, but a \\"ceremonial transfer of office\\" of council members who were appointed. The service was not part of the liturgical year with cantata texts related to prescribed biblical epistle and gospel readings. For the Ratswechsel service, Bach could count on the entire council (his employer) listening, and probably also civil servants and representatives of the Elector's administration for the region. The musicologist Klaus Hofmann notes: \\"It was an opportunity for Bach to show how sacred music was flourishing under his direction and to present himself as a composer.\\" The cantata was Bach's first for the occasion in Leipzig. Early in his career he had written at least one cantata for the equivalent service at M√ºhlhausen. There are five surviving cantatas for the Ratswechsel at Leipzig, and librettos of three more, BWV Anh. I 3, 4 and 193. The other four extant cantatas are Ihr Tore zu Zion, BWV 193, composed for the occasion in 1727 but partly lost, Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir, BWV 29, composed for the occasion in 1731, Gott, man lobet dich in der Stille, BWV 120, adapted from earlier cantatas for wedding and homage probably in 1742, and Lobe den Herrn, meine Seele, BWV 69, adapted from Lobe den Herrn, meine Seele, BWV 69a, for the occasion in 1748. The text was written by an unknown librettist who included psalm verses (from Psalms 147, 85 and 126) and lines from Martin Luther's German Te Deum \\"Herr Gott, dich loben wir\\". To suit the event for which it was written, these are all turned into hymns of thanking and praising God for Leipzig's prosperity and asking him to protect the city in the future. Bach led the Thomanerchor in the performance on 30 August 1723.  Scoring and structure  Bach structured the cantata in nine movements with choral movements as a frame and in movement 7, otherwise alternating recitatives and arias. He scored it for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and an orchestra of four trumpets (Tr), timpani (Ti), two recorders (Fl), three oboes (Ob), two of them also playing oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach- Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Music  Even among other festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four trumpets is unusual. It is characterised by a very solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus in the form of a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in K√∂then. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God ‚Äì the supreme ruler ‚Äì is entitled to have the last word.  1  The cantata opens with a French overture, unusual in featuring the chorus in the faster middle section. At the time of Louis XIV an overture in this style was played when the king and his entourage entered a performance. Bach's music expresses a similar respect for the authority of the town councils. The mostly homophonic slow opening is in the typical dotted rhythms, and shows a remarkable concerto of the trumpets versus the rest of the orchestra. The chorus appears only in the middle section, proclaiming verses from Psalm 147, \\"'\\" (Praise the Lord, Jerusalem). It uses both fugal techniques and paired entries. The coda is a recapitulation of the first section. Analysis of corrections show that Bach probably used an instrumental piece composed earlier, and that the characteristic upward run on the first word \\"Preise\\" was added later. The text from psalm 147,12‚Äì14a addresses Jerusalem, but the Leipzig congregation understood it as their city.  2  A secco recitative introduces the topic, \\"'\\" (Blessed land, fortunate city): a town is blessed if God reigns in it.  3  The oboes da caccia present a dotted-rhythm ritornello to introduce the tenor aria. The vocal entry is before the ritornello cadence, \\"'\\" (Good fortune, you people of the lindens), a reference to Leipzig sometimes being called '.  4  The bass recitative, \\"'\\" (So gloriously you stand, dear city!), is introduced and concluded with a fanfare-like trumpet and timpani line, further wind instruments, recorders and oboes da caccia add colour to the middle section, in an unusual movement for the Leipzig congregation.  5  The alto aria, \\"'\\" (Authority is God's gift), is accompanied by two obbligato recorders in unison. It is the only minor-mode movement of the cantata. The obbligato presents high repeated notes beginning midway through the ritornello theme, which recurs as episodes and at the conclusion of the movement. The movement is, in effect, a trio sonata.  6  A soprano recitative, \\"'\\" (Now! we acknowledge it and bring to You), expresses thanks for God's gift and acknowledgement of the burden on the people serving as town council, those who did it the last year and those who succeed.  7  A choral movement confirms \\"'\\" (The Lord has done good things for us). The movement is structured like a da capo aria, with a fugue in the opening and repeat, while the contrasting middle section is mostly homophonic. A a long ritornello theme features an \\"imperious\\" trumpet melody, which is played four times during the movement. The voices then enter from the lowest to the highest, with the fugal section based on the first phrase of . Additional instruments then lead to a climax. In the middle section motifs from the ritornello are played \\"above and between\\" the voices. One fanfare motif appears also in Bach's first Brandenburg Concerto and would later be used in the bass aria ' in the Christmas Oratorio. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann assumes, reflecting its secular character as a hunting signal and fanfare, that the movement is derived from an earlier homage cantata.  8  A very short alto recitative, \\"'\\" (Finally! Since You have established us as Your people), is harmonically \\"adventurous\\".  9  The cantata ends with the ninth stanza from Luther's German Te Deum, \\"'\\" (Help Your people, Lord Jesus Christ), a prayer for further help and preservation. It is a four-part setting \\"with the subtlest touches of flamboyance\\" in a chorale. No individual parts for the cantata have survived; and the score provides only the four-part setting without mentioning which instruments would play with which voice. Hofmann imagines that there might have been additional parts for trumpets and timpani for an ending to match the opening of the cantata.  Recordings  The entries in the table are taken from the selection on the Bach Cantatas Website. Ensembles playing period instruments are marked by green background.  2015 performance  The cantata was performed in the opening concert of the Bachfest Leipzig on 12 June 2015, celebrating 1000 years since the first recorded mention of Leipzig and the 850th anniversary of the Nikolaikirche. A line from the libretto was the festival's motto for the occasion: \\"So herrlich stehst du, liebe Stadt!\\" (So gloriously you stand, dear city!). The cantata was performed at the Nikolaikirche by Ute Selbig, Britta Schwarz, Patrick Grahl, Jochen Kupfer, the Thomanerchor and the H√§ndelfestspielorchester Halle, conducted by Gotthold Schwarz.

The family moved to Sydney in August 1929 at the beginning of the Great Depression, and became involved in the communism through the unemployed workers movement. Patricia, having joined the Young Communist League, was arrested in November 1930 and sentenced to fourteen days in prison for participating in an unauthorised demonstration.

Devanny came to the notice of the Communist Party of Australia and in 1931 was sent to communist international school in Moscow, where she studied Marxist-Leninist theory. After returning to Australia in 1933 she became national secretary of the Young Communist League and brought the organisation from semi-secrecy into daily political life. She and her husband, seaman Ronald William Jackson Hurd (who had fought with a British battalion in the Spanish Civil War), travelled to New Zealand for the birth of her son before returning to Sydney.

() is a book by Ukrainian writer and social activist Ivan Dziuba, written in September-December 1965. History of writing The immediate impetus for writing this work were political repressions that took place in Ukrainian SSR in 1965 against the Ukrainian intellectuals. In August and September 1965 in Kiev, Lviv, Lutsk, Ivano- Frankivsk and Ternopil about three dozen of young Ukrainian intellectuals were arrested. On September 4 in Kiev during the premiere of the Sergei Parajanov's movie Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors poets Vasyl Stus and Ivan Dziuba called for protesting against political repression. Content In the work Internationalism or Russification?, written under the influence of those events, Dziuba analyzed from a Marxist position the national and cultural policy of the Soviet Union in Ukraine. The author sent his work to the first Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Petro Shelest, and to the Head of the Ukrainian SSR government, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, and its Russian translation - to the leadership of Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In Internationalism or Russification? Dziuba argued that during Joseph Stalin's rule the CPSU had moved to the positions of Russian chauvinism. His argumentation the author built largely on quotations from the works of Vladimir Lenin and party documents of the 1920s. He believed that the policy of the CPSU, particularly in Ukraine, contradicts with the fundamental interests of the Ukrainian people and contended that the solution is in returning to Lenin's principles of national policy. Spread of the book The work Internationalism or Russification? spread in the samizdat, and in 1968 it was published abroad by the journal publisher Suchasnist. Without permission and knowledge of the author the book was repeatedly issued outside of the Soviet Union in Ukrainian, English, Russian, Chinese French and Italian languages. In Ukraine, this work was legally published only in 1990 in the magazine Motherland (–í—ñ—Ç—á–∏–∑–Ω–∞), and as a book it was first published in 1998. The reaction of the Soviet government The Soviet government announced Internationalism or Russification? as an Anti-Soviet work, and its distribution, storage or even just reading - as a crime. Dziuba lost his job, he was expelled from the Writers' Union of Ukraine and faced harassment from the KGB, and in 1972 was jailed for 18 months.

After the first two days of protests, 18 deaths, 98 serious injuries and 275 arrests had been reported. Further demonstrations were organised on 17 August and 21 September The first protest was later cancelled due to the intervention of a UN representative in initiating a dialogue; however, the talks broke down with more protests planned for Red Wednesday through a national vigil. Causes The protesters' grievances were highlighted in a 15-page petition which included a list of 20 demands: *Acute and growing fuel shortages ‚Äì queuing for fuel was becoming progressively worse over the past two years. *Forex shortfalls *Electricity shortages *Introduction of the \\"Zero Deficit Budget\\" ‚Äì this budget was introduced after England withdrew budgetary support from Malawi. *Firing of four university lecturers, including Jessie Kabwila-Kapasula, Blessings Chinsinga, Gaston Kanchedzera and Edge Kanyongoro and limiting academic freedom at the University of Malawi. *Attempts against controlling public protests through the requirement of a fee-to-protest of K2 million for mass demonstrations. *Relations with the United Kingdom following the expulsion of the High Commissioner to Malawi as a result of the Chochraine-Dyet controversy by The Nation. *Press freedom, particularly for the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation. *Failure to monitor proceeds of the Australian company Paladin Energy *Expansion of the cabinet *Payments to First Lady Callista Mutharika *Nepotism and the succession of wa Mutharika's brother Peter Mutharika as the head of state. *\\"Injunctions Bill,\\" which prevents obtaining injunctions against the government despite a court rejection of the bill. *Reversal of the unpopular change to the Flag of Malawi *\\"Sheer arrogance\\" of wa Mutharika *Unconstitutional treatment of elected officials, notably attempts to strip Vice President Joyce Banda of rights and privileges accorded by the Constitution of Malawi Protests After several weeks of protests, on 19 July, the government issued an order banning civil society organisations from protesting. A day before the protest, the government set out to intimidate potential protestors. Two vehicles belonging to the independent private radio station Zodiak Radio were set alight by masked men.http://www.nyasatimes.com/politics/dpp-will-rule- beyond-2014-%E2%80%98like-it-or-not%E2%80%99-zikhale/ In the commercial capital Blantyre, five official DPP vehicles carrying DPP Youth Cadets (a youth wing of the DPP) were seen driving around the city waving machetes. The government obtained an injunction to stop the protests. 20 July A coalition of 80 Civil societies and NGOs, religious and student groups (collectively known as 'Concerned Citizens') chose 20 July 2011 as a day of national protest against economic and administrative management. Prominent civil and human rights organisations like the umbrella NGO Human Rights Consultative Committee (HRCC) and the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation (CHRR) were both a part of the Concerned Citizens group and played a central role in planning the protest. It also included the Malawi Law Society and the Council of Churches. Mutharika then scheduled a public lecture for the same day to which he invited all citizens, NGO's and civil societies upon registration. The Concerned Citizens largely said that they would not attend a 'lecture' by the president because they wanted dialogue and their concerns to be addressed. Pro-government supporters then scheduled a pro- government protest on the same day, 20 July. On the morning of 20 July 2011, mass anti-government protests began in the major cities of Mzuzu, Blantyre, and the capital Lilongwe. Protests also occurred in Zomba, Kasungu, and Ntchesi. The Concerned Citizens were wearing red shirts and other articles of clothing and called themselves the \\"Red Army for Democracy and Peace.\\" The protests began peacefully with participants singing the national anthem, taking photos, holding signs and giving speeches. Many were waving the old Malawi flag the public display of which had been banned by the Mutharika government. The government response to these protests included preemptive arrests of civil society leaders. Police assaulted MCP spokesperson Nancy Tembo, Joyce Banda's sister Anjimile Oponyo, The Nation journalist Kondwani Munthali and the head of the HRCC Undule Mwakasungula. There was a clamp down by police on anyone wearing red clothes which was particularly violent in Mzuzu. Police forces began to disrupt broadcasts by radio stations, and ordered journalists not to report on the protests. Anti-government citizens clashed with security forces in the northern cities of Mzuzu and Karonga and Blantyre. After the national lecture by President Mutharika, which failed to address the grievances of the protesters, tensions grew further and looting of targeted business and properties began. Business properties of political allies of the president were targeted, along with the homes of two police officers in the north that had participated in the clampdown of protesters with excessive force. The violence continued to grow largely in the major cities. 21 July Although the protests were only planned for 20 July, they continued the next day because of the manner in which the government responded to the protests. The government did not acknowledge that there was discontent in the country and clamped down on journalists, radio stations, citizens and protesters wearing red. On 21 July the army was sent in to reinforce riot police already present in Mzuzu, Blantyre, Ntchesi, and in the capital Lilongwe. At least two people were killed amid widespread looting in the suburbs of Lilongwe as Mutharika vowed to \\"use any measure I can think of\\" to quell the unrest. 22 July The director of the Church and Society rights organisation, Moses Mkandawire, said that the government had blocked funeral processions for seven of those killed in the previous two days' protests. \\"We have been stopped by the government with our arrangements to bury the seven heroes. The government says it will provide transport to have the seven buried in their respective [village] homes.\\" Al Jazeera reported that many of these protest leaders had received death threats and gone into hiding for fear of arrest or worse. 23 July Vice President Joyce Banda, one of the opposition leaders Mutharika accused of inciting unrest, publicly endorsed the protests against Mutharika's government and stated \\"regret\\" for deaths, injuries, and property damage incurred during the demonstrations. Banda, thought to be entertaining a run for the presidency in 2014, suggested poor economic conditions, corruption, and weak democratic institutions had forced Malawians to take to the streets. She said she had appealed to Mutharika to hold a dialogue with the United Kingdom, the former colonial power of Malawi with which the Mutharika administration had recently become embroiled in a diplomatic row, over the Cochrane-Dyet cable in the hopes of forging an agreement to provide Malawi with economic relief. 26 July Rafiq Hajat, the director of the Institute for Policy Interaction warned Mutharika that if he did not address protesters' demands by 16 August, demonstrations would resume on 17 August with the goal of ending his regime. The Public Affairs Committee, a group composed of both Christian and Muslim activists, also warned that \\"should [the] government continue to harass people for no proper reasons, another demonstration will be inevitable. Bullets and tear gas have never triumphed over the will of the people.\\" 17 August The Concerned Citizens of Malawi staged another protest on 17 August in the form of a national vigil for the victims of the 20 July protest. The vigil was, however, cancelled a day before the protests due to the intervention of the United Nations who engaged civil society groups and the government in dialogue. The dialogue later broke down because of what the civil society groups said was continued intimidation being faced outside the meeting.http://www.malawivoice.com/national-news/21-september-virgil-to-go- ahead-mayaya/ A string of arson cases were also reported, including fires at the offices of Rafiq Hajat and the home of Reverend MacDonald Sembereka.http://allafrica.com/stories/201109192179.html wa Mutharika was accused of being behind the arsons, particularity since he threatened protest leaders by saying he would \\"smoke you out.\\" He later denied being behind the arsons.http://www.bnltimes.com/national/42-all/2437-malawi-president-denies- being-behind-arsons.html No one has been arrested or found guilty of partaking in the arson cases, but the government has condemned them. 20‚Äì21 September ‚Äì Red Wednesday The two primary markets in Blantyre and Lilongwe were also burned down on 20 September a day before the Red Wednesday protests on 21 September. On 21 September a national stay-at-home was organised with the aim of shutting down the economy via a general strikehttps://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hTm6N1iLrOfyoHYieXLqe01CGGcQ?docId=56e171666a0d446d8d8a601db9a531b1http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2011/09/21/malawi- activists-create-%E2%80%98red-wednesday%E2%80%99/ on what the organisers called \\"Red Wednesday.\\" Businesses and banks across the country were closed; at the same time there was also a heavy police presence and protestors clad in red. People were also urged by the organisers to hold vigils at home to commemorate the deaths of Malawians killed during the protests in July. The protest was held on Wednesday to mark the day of the 19 people during the July protests; it also marks the beginning of a planned for three day stay-at-home strike. Bingu wa Mutharika called for an end to the strike on the state-owned Malawi Broadcasting Corporation warning that \\"You can‚Äôt bully me into submission. [The] government can‚Äôt be taken to ransom by a few disgruntled individuals hiding in the name of civil society. If you stop people from going to work, I will deal with you.\\" He added that the strikes were illegal, while telling people to return to work the next day. Domestic responses Following the violence, Mutharika called on the people of Malawi to \\"stop the rioting and let's sit down to discuss. I have a responsibility, based on the powers vested in me by the constitution to bring law and order.\\" After accusing the protesters of being \\"led by Satan,\\" he then blamed his former deputy Joyce Banda and opposition leaders John Tembo, as well as other civil society leaders of being responsible for the violent protests. \\"The blood of these people who have died is on you. Let their spirits haunt you at night. This time I'll go after you! Even if you hide in holes I'll smoke you out!\\" He also said that those organising the protests should face the \\"consequences.\\" His rhetoric saying to protesters saying that he would \\"smoke you out\\" was in reference to former United States President George W. Bush, who used the same words for Osama bin Laden. First Lady Callista Mutharika publicly castigated the NGO's that organised the protests for allegedly being paid by Western donors to \\"disturb the peace\\" and promote homosexuality, stating that they would \\"go to hell.\\"http://www.nationmw.net/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=23717:malawi- first-lady-bashes-local-ngos&catid;=1:national- news&Itemid;=3http://www.nyasatimes.com/national/ngo%E2%80%99s-hit-back- at-%E2%80%98reckless%E2%80%99-first-lady/ She further said that villagers should not have an interest in the protest over fuel and foreign exchange since they do not drive cars and because they don't engage in cross border trade. She urged village chiefs and the rural population at-large not to protest. Her response was received with much criticism from civil society. Cabinet and army reshuffle On 19 August, state-owned radio reported that Mutharika sacked his entire cabinet without announcing a reason for the move.

However, it still included controversial posts such as his wife Callista Mutharika as a cabinet member, his brother Peter Mutharika as Minister of Foreign Affairs and former Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Culture Ken Lipenga as Minister of Finance, while excluding former Vice President Joyce Banda, wa Mutharika has repeatedly referred to the cabinet as a \\"war cabinet\\" charged with defending the \\"integrity of nation.\\" Mutharika hastened the retirement of the head of the army, General Marko Chiziko and appointed a new army chief after the protests.http://indepthafrica.com/news/east-africa/mutharika-unhappy-with- army/ Chiziko's replacement is General Henry Odillo. Zimbabwean mercenaries Mutharika was accused of hiring mercenaries from Zimbabwe to patrol the streets and suppress protestors in preparation for the second protest which was to take place in the form of a national vigil. They were hired after consultations by wa Mutharika with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe after it became clear that the Malawian army would not shoot at Malawians during the planned protests due to discontent in the army. The Zimbabwean personnel were stationed in Lilongwe, Mzuzu, Blantayre, and Zomba. 2014 presidential election In spite of the nationwide protest against the Mutharika regime, in early August 2011 the DPP National Governing Council (NGC) endorsed Peter Mutharika, the presidents brother, as a presidential candidate for the 2014 presidential election.http://www.nationmw.net/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=23846:are- voters-ready-for-peter-mutharika&catid;=62:national-news&Itemid;=59 He is currently the Minister of Education, Science and Technology. This early announcement came a few days after the protests. His appointment decision was made by President Bingu wa Mutharika and endorsed by the council without a party convention. DPP Secretary General Wakuda Kamanga stated that they are optimistic that the country will elect another Mutharika in spite of the protests because the \\"anger would phase out.\\" The party also sacked other leaders that had been against the promotion of the Peter Mutharika as a candidate, including first vice-president Joyce Banda and second vice- president Khumbo Kachale.

The masks are made of wood and other natural materials and used in funeral ceremonies called malagan. Manufacture Tatanua face masks are normally carved from lime wood and completed and decorated with fibres from sugar cane, wool and other animal hair. The face is coloured using chalk and other natural dyes.Tatanua mask, World Treasures, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, accessed 21 July 2011 The type with a high headdress are created using a cane framework that was formerly then covered in bark, although later imported fabric was used as the covering. Besides the fabric, some masks also included imported optical brighteners, which made some nominally white areas slightly blue. The masks are frequently identifiable by the pierced ear lobes and prominent mouth, which is normally carved as if the mouth is open. The masks can also be identified by the asymmetrical hair design: the mask is left bare of hair on one side to mimic how a New Ireland man would shave his head to show that he was in mourning. Ceremony Tatanua masks are worn by ceremonial dancers and are often a part of New Ireland Malagan rituals. These are funerary religious ceremonies held by the family of the deceased to communicate with deities and to show respect for the deceased. Mannequins or statues representing the soul of the deceased are also shown at the malagan ceremonies. The local people construct them so that they celebrate the dead person's characteristics. They are elaborated with anthropomorphic symbols which are thought to represent the link between the people of New Ireland, their creation and the spiritual world to which they eventually pass on. The dances were performed in groups; only those who were respected would be allowed the honour of performing the dance, as it was important that observers see the community's strength. The carved masks may take many months to construct, so that the person's death may not be formally marked for some time. The celebrations would be used as a time for the community to illustrate its skills to its neighbours as well as to meet, agree and perform the cultural aspect of a community member dying. Examples Examples of this style of mask can be seen in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, the British Museum and the Indianapolis Museum of Art.

The Tangut people of the Tang, Sung and Yuan dynasties may be of Qiang descent. The modern Qiang people as well as Tibetans may also have been descended in part from the ancient Qiangs. Etymology According to the Han dynasty dictionary Shuowen Jiezi, the Qiang were shepherds, and the Chinese character for Qiang () was thus formed from the characters for \\"sheep\\" (Áæä) and \\"man\\" (‰∫∫), and pronounced like \\"sheep\\". Shouwen Original text: ÁæåÔºöË•øÊàéÁâßÁæä‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªé‰∫∫‰ªéÁæäÔºåÁæä‰∫¶ËÅ≤„ÄÇ Fengsu Tongyi also mentions that character of Qiang was formed from the words \\"sheep\\" and \\"man\\". Modern scholars have attempted to reconstruct the ancient pronunciation of Qiang: sinologist Edwin Pulleyblank reconstructs it to *k ∞ia≈ã in Middle Chinese, while William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart reconstruct the Old Chinese name of Qiang as *C.q ∞a≈ã.Baxter, William H. and Laurent Sagart. 2014. Old Chinese: A New Reconstruction. Oxford University Press, . Qiangs are generally believed to be Tibeto-Burman speakers, although Christopher Beckwith proposes that the word \\"Qiang\\" may have an Indo-European etymology and that the Qiang were of Indo-European origin; Beckwith compares a proposed reconstruction of Qiang to *kla≈ã in Old Chinese to the Tocharian word , meaning \\"to ride, go by wagon\\", as in \\"to ride off to hunt from a chariot\\", so that Qiang could actually mean \\"charioteer\\". History According to a legend the Qiang were partly descended from the Yan Emperor, the mythical \\"Flame Emperor.\\" The Yan Emperor and his tribe were defeated by the Yellow Emperor. Origins The term \\"Qiang\\" first appeared on oracle bone inscriptions 3,000 years ago and was used to describe \\"a people other than one's people.\\"The Creation of the Qiang Ethnicity, its Relation to the Rme People and the Preservation of Rme Language, p.56-63 It appears again in the Classic of Poetry in reference to Tang of Shang (trad. 1675‚Äì1646 BC).Shi Jing, Sacrificial Odes of Shang, Yin Wu. „ÄäË©©Á∂ì¬∑ÂïÜÈ†å¬∑ÊÆ∑Ê≠¶„Äã: \\"ÊòîÊúâÊàêÊπØÔºåËá™ÂΩºÊ∞êÁæåÔºåËé´Êï¢‰∏ç‰æÜ‰∫´ÔºåËé´Êï¢‰∏ç‰æÜÁéã\\"„ÄÇ They seem to have lived in a diagonal band from northern Shaanxi to northern Henan, somewhat to the south of the later Beidi. They were enemy of the Shang dynasty, who mounted expeditions against them, capturing slaves and victims for human sacrifice. The Qiang prisoners were skilled in making oracle bones. This ancient tribe is said to be the progenitor of both the modern Qiang and the Tibetan people.Bradley Mayhew, Korina Miller, Alex English: South-West China. 2002. Northern S√≠chuan - Around W√©nchuan, page 517. There are still many ethnological and linguistic links between the Qiang and the Tibetans. The Qiang tribe expanded eastward and joined the Han people in the course of historical development, while the other branch that traveled southwards, crosses over the Hengduan Mountains, and entered the Yungui Plateau; some went even farther, to Burma, forming numerous ethnic groups of the Tibetan-Burmese language family.Chen Qingying, Tibetan History, ‰∫îÊ¥≤‰º†Êí≠Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 2003. page 7. Even today, from linguistic similarities, their relative relationship can be seen. They formed the Tibetan ethnicity after the unification of the Tubo kingdom. According to Fei Xiaotong: \\"Even if the Qiang people might not be regarded as the main source of the Tibetan people, it is undoubtedly that the Qiang people played a certain role in the formation of Tibetan race\\". Shuowen Jiezi indicated that the Qiangs were shepherds from the west and they were part of the Xirong.

Some of the ancient groups were called the \\"Horse-Qiang\\" or \\"Many-Horse-Qiang\\" (Ma Qiang or Duo Ma Qiang), suggesting they may have been horse breeders. During the Han dynasty, a group of nomads to the southwest of Dunhuang were known as the Chuo Qiang (). They were described in the Book of Han as a people who moved with their livestock in search of water and pasture, made military weapons themselves using iron from the mountains, and possessed bows, lances, short knives, swords and armour. In the Weil√ºe, other Qiang tribes named were the \\"Brown Onion\\", \\"White Horse\\", and \\"Yellow Ox\\" Qiang.Annotated translation of the Weil√ºe by John E. Hill The various tribes of the Qiangs formed a confederation against the Han but were defeated. Later in the Han Dynasty, groups of people in the western part of Sichuan were mentioned in the Book of the Later Han as separate branches of the Qiang. A song from one of these groups, the \\"White Wolf\\" people, was transcribed in Chinese characters together with Chinese translation, and the language has since been identified as a Tibeto-Burman language. Han In the mid-2nd century BC, the Lesser Yuezhi fled into southern Gansu and merged with the Qiang population. In 112 BC, the Han dynasty invaded what is now eastern Tibet with 25,000 cavalry on grounds of Qiang raiding. In 65 BC, the Qiang revolted in what is now eastern Tibet. In 42 BC, the Qiang rebelled and defeated a force of 12,000 under Feng Fengshi. In 41 BC, Feng Fengshi returned to what is now eastern Tibet with 60,000 men and crushed the Qiang rebellion. In 49 AD, the Qiang tribes retook the Qinghai region from the Han. In 57 AD, the Qiang led by Dianyu raided Jincheng Commandery. In 59 AD, a Han army defeated Dianyu. In 107 AD, Dianlian of the Qiang Xianlian attacked Liang Province. As a result the Protectorate of the Western Regions was abandoned. The Han court sent Deng Zhi and Ren Shang against the invading army, and although the Qiang forces suffered significant casualties, they were defeated at Hanyang Commandery. Having achieved victory against the Han army, Dianlian proclaimed himself emperor at Beidi Commandery. Qiang forces now threatened Han territory as far south as Hanzhong Commandery and as far east as Ji Province. In 109 AD, Dianlian conquered Longxi Commandery. In 110 AD, Dianlian defeated and killed the Administrator Zheng Qin in Hanzhong Commandery. In 112 AD, Dianlian died and was succeeded by his son Lianchang. Lianchang was too young to exercise authority and another man of the tribe, Langmo, took charge of strategy. The new regime was significantly less effective under the regent and failed to make any headway against Han forces. In 116 AD, the Han general Deng Zun led 10,000 Southern Xiongnu cavalry in a raid on Lianchang's headquarters from the north. Meanwhile Ren Shang attacked from the south and killed Lianchang's wife and children. In 117 AD, Lianchang was assassinated and forces under Ren Shang ended Qiang raids. In 120 AD, the Qiang chieftain Jiwu attacked Jincheng Commandery and was defeated by the general Ma Xian. In 121 AD, the Qiang Shaodang tribe under Manu raided Wuwei Commandery but were defeated by the general Ma Xian the following year. In 140 AD, the Qiang rebelled. In 142 AD, the Qiang rebellion was put down. In 167 AD, Duan Jiong conducted an anti- Qiang campaign and massacred Qiang populations as well as settled them outside the frontier. In 184 AD, Beigong Boyu, a member of the Auxiliary of Loyal Barbarians of Huangzhong, started the Liang Province rebellion. The rebels captured Jincheng and reached Youfufeng Commandery in 185, and from there carried out raids against Chang'an. A Han army was sent out against them led by Huangfu Song and Zhang Wen but they failed to achieve any major victory.

Sixteen Kingdoms During the era of Sixteen Kingdoms, a Qiang leader, Yao Chang, founded the state of Later Qin 384‚Äì417 CE).http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/qiang.html Northern and Southern dynasties During the period of Northern and Southern dynasties, Fan Ye (398-445) wrote a history of the Western Qiang describing traits such as \\"disheveled hair\\", folding their coat from the left side, and marriage customs where a widow would either marry her son or the deceased husband's brother. According to Fan, the Qiang lived in tribes and had no unified ruler. Tang During the Tang dynasty, the Dangxiang Qiang moved to the region of Xiazhou around modern Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province. They eventually founded the state of Western Xia (1038‚Äì1227 CE) and came to be known as the Tanguts. Another group of Qiang migrated south to the Min River in modern Sichuan Province. They came to be known as the Ran and Mang who were the ancestors of the modern Qiang people. Tibetan Empire According to the New Book of Tang, the \\"Bod originates from the Qiang.\\" According to the Da Qing yi tong zhi (1735), the Tibetan Empire was founded by a branch of the Fa Qiang. Song According to the polymath Shen Kuo, the Qiang were noted for producing high quality steel armour. Yuan During the Yuan dynasty, the term Qiang was replaced by Fan (Bod), and the people of the western plateaus were called \\"Western Bod\\". The two terms were used interchangeably until the Qing dynasty when Qiang came to refer to those living upstream of the Min River. Modern Qiangs Yandi, Dayu and Li Yuanhao , the most important deities of the Qiang people. It is located on Qiangshan, in Qiang City, Mao County of Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, in Sichuan. Qiang guard tower Traditional Qiang house Modern Qiang people are believed to be descended from the ancient Qiangs. The Qiang were first described as nomadic shepherds living in the region of contemporary Gansu and Qinghai provinces. At some point prior to the modern era they settled and adopted an agricultural way of life. Due to constant conflict between Qiang tribes and other peoples, the Qiang built numerous stone guard towers with small windows and doors, giving them the moniker of \\"Stone Tower Culture\\". These constructs, described as Himalayan Towers, can be found today in eastern Tibet and Sichuan Province.https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/sichuan/travel-tips-and- articles/the-inside-info-on-chinas-ancient- watchtowers/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d27762ce Qiang society followed matrilineal descent and it was men who integrated into the women's lineage at their deaths. There was no formal marriage ceremony or ritual. Instead the men traveled to their wives' residences and worked their land for a long period of time as bride service. Despite the centrality of women in Qiang families, Qiang society was neither matriarchal or egalitarian. Men held all the important political and religious positions, although there is some evidence that female shamans existed at one point. Like most agricultural societies, women were responsible for domestic and agricultural work while men engaged in construction, transport, and plowing. The Qiang revered the tiger and featured it prominently on their totem poles. White stones were also considered to be sacred and sometimes put on altars or rooftops. Qiang religion resembles animism and shamanism. It places spiritual belief in the natural features of the landscape and the ability of shamans to contact spirits.

Elizabeth and Jack Miles February 1913Miles was born at Wilton, Roxburghshire, Scotland, to journeyman mason William Miles and Louisa, n√©e Wiggins. He was educated at Edinburgh and apprenticed to a stonemason in northern England. He was employed at Newcastle and then Consett in Durham, where he joined the Independent Labour Party. On 9 October 1911, he married Elizabeth Jane Black at Lanchester; the couple emigrated to Queensland and arrived in Brisbane on the Orama on 31 March 1913. Miles was recruited to the Queensland Socialist League in 1918, and was a founding member of the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) in 1920. Employed as a meatworker from 1920 to 1923, he represented the Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union on the Trades and Labor Council before returning to stonemasonry and representing the United Operative Stonemasons' Society of Queensland. In the late 1920s, having risen to prominence in the CPA, he and Lance Sharkey won control on a platform of strong opposition to the Australian Labor Party's \\"social fascist\\" policies. Miles disliked middle-class communist converts, condemning Fred Paterson and John Anderson. Miles visited the Soviet Union 1934-35 and on his return embarked on a national tour to promote the communist cause. During the early 1930s, he also had an affair with writer and fellow communist Jean Devanny. Miles adopted the pseudonym \\"A. Mason\\" after the CPA was banned in 1940, and re-emerged after the party was rehabilitated by the Soviet Union's entry into the war, but he was overshadowed by Sharkey. He was described by an ASIO officer in 1953 as the \\"Grand Old Man of Australian Communism\\", and remained firmly committed to the cause throughout the revelations concerning Stalinism in the early 1950s. He died at Naremburn in 1969 and was cremated.

Its development started in 2008 within the CancerGrid and EDGeS projects. The aim was to create a generic bridge component that can be used in different grid interoperability scenarios. The 3G Bridge used within the EDGeS project that provides the core component of the Service Grid - Desktop Grid interoperability solution. 3G Bridge helps to connect user communities of different grid systems. For example, communities working on parameter sweep problems (physics, biologists, ...) and using service grid infrastructures can migrate their applications to the more adequate desktop grid platform using the 3G Bridge technology, resulting in an accelerated research. The project, started in 2008, is technically coordinated by Prof. Peter Kacsuk, head of the Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Systems and Msc. Zoltan Farkas, research leader of LPDS at MTA-SZTAKI, Hungary. Architecture  3G Bridge is currently actively used in the EDGI and DEGSICO projects as the job bridging technology between service and desktop grids. 3G Bridge enables interconnecting different grid technologies by migrating jobs between them. This way it allows to move specific type of applications to an adequate execution platform, and enables load sharing among different grid infrastructures, resulting in increased job capacity and faster execution. The 3G Bridge has the following main components: ‚Ä¢ Job Handler Interface: this is a very simple MySQL interface for handling jobs in the 3G Bridge Job Database. Can be used by local MySQL clients, or a very simple application shipped with the 3G Bridge called 'injector'. ‚Ä¢ WSSubmitter: this is a Web Service interface above the 3G Bridge Job Database. Using this interface, remote clients can add jobs to the 3G Bridge for execution, or check the status of already submitted ones. ‚Ä¢ 3G Bridge Job Database: this is a MySQL database that contains the set of jobs the 3G Bridge should handle. Important properties of the jobs, like executable name, command-line arguments, list of files used is stored within the database. ‚Ä¢ Download Manager: this component is responsible for fetching the input files belonging to jobs submitted in a remote manner. ‚Ä¢ Queue Manager: this component arranges the execution and management of 3G Bridge jobs, periodically calls the different grid plugins in order to manage jobs assigned to them. ‚Ä¢ Grid Handler Interface: this is a generic interface above the grid plugins. By using this generic layer, no 3G Bridge components other than the grid plugins must contain grid-specific code. The methods a grid plugin should implement is: submission and status update. ‚Ä¢ Grid Plugin: grid plugins are responsible for managing jobs in destination grids. For each plugin, there can be a number of instances, for example for submitting jobs to different EGEE VOs. The 3G Bridge supports the following grids: EGEE, BOINC, XtremWeb-HEP, and OurGrid. ‚Ä¢ HTTPD: is a web server so remote clients can fetch output files of finished jobs from the 3G Bridge server. The main programming language is C++, however 3G Bridge supports implementing grid plugins in Java. Web service interfaces are implemented using gSOAP. Destination plugins * Null: the simplest plugin which first sets incoming job's status to running, and finished afterwards. * DC-API-Single: this plugin can be used to submit individual jobs to a BOINC-based desktop grid. This plugin is mainly used in the EDGI project. * DC-API: this plugin is an enhanced version of the DC-API- Single plugin, capable of submitting job batches to the BOINC server. The batch feature enables packing many short-running jobs into one BOINC workunit, resulting in increased computation-to- communication ratio. * EGEE: the EGEE plugin can be used to submit jobs to gLite-based service grids. This plugin is extensively used within the DEGISCO project, solving bridging BOINC workunits to gLite. * XtremWeb: this plugin can be used to submit jobs to XtremWeb-based desktop grids. The plugin is actively used within the EDGI project. * BES: the BES plugin can be used to submit jobs to OGSA BES resources, like ARC or UNICORE. * EC2: this plugin can be used to execute jobs on different Cloud systems.

Spokespeople on the behalf of Putin and the Russian government have consistently dismissed Putin's connections to the property and the related allegations of corruption. In February 2011 the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that it had seen documents which supported Kolesnikov by implicating Vladimir Kozhin, Head of the Presidential Property Management Department, who had denied any involvement. A spokesman refused to comment on the Novaya Gazeta article. The presence of Federal Protective Service (FSO) activity in the area has been claimed as further evidence of state involvement. In April 2011 PPMD head Vladimir Kozhin admitted Kremlin involvement with the project when he said that his office was contracted by Lirus Management (Rosinvest, a subsidiary of Lirus, was directly financing the construction of the palace) to carry out the contract for the construction of the palace. In March 2011, it was reported that Alexander Ponomarenko, a businessman and billionaire who made his money in sea ports, banking, commercial real estate and airport construction, acquired the company \\"Idokopas\\" which owned the palace.Friendly Oligarch Buys 'Putin' Palace, themoscowtimes.com, 4 March 2011Alexander Ponomarenko, forbes.com, 18 March 2015 At the time of the purchase, Idokopas owned around 67 hectares of \\"recreational\\" land near the settlement of Praskoveyeka, including a \\"guesthouse\\" complex amounting to 26,000 square meters. Ponomarenko also said he had bought a second company, \\"Lazurnaya Yagoda,‚Äù which owned 60 hectares of agricultural land near Divnomorsk, a settlement 13 kilometers from Praskoveyevka. Ponomarenko bought the unfinished complex from Nikolai Shamalov, a member of Putin's circle and the businessman at the centre of Kolesnikov's claims, and his partners. At the time of the purchase, Ponomarenko did not disclose the value of the deal, but hinted he had been able to purchase the property for a very good price ‚Äì the asset was heavily encumbered with debts and the developers had run out of money to complete the project. When asked about the projected value of the complex once complete, he conceded that suggestions it could be as much as $350 million ‚Äúwere close to the truth.‚Äù According to Vedomosti, however, experts estimated the value of the property at $20 million.The so-called 'Putin Palace' is sold , themoscownews.com, 03/03/2011 In July 2011, ‚ÄúLazurnaya Yagoda‚Äù was sold to SVL Group, controlled by Boris Titov, the owner of champagne factory ‚ÄúAbrau Durso.‚Äù\\"–ê–±—Ä–∞—É-–î—é—Ä—Å–æ\\" –ø—Ä–∏—à–ª–æ—Å—å –∫–æ –¥–≤–æ—Ä—Ü—É –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –¢–∏—Ç–æ–≤ –∫—É–ø–∏–ª –≤–∏–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∏ —Å–∞–Ω–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è, —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–≤—à–µ–≥–æ—Å—è –¥–∞—á–µ–π –ø—Ä–µ–º—å–µ—Ä-–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞ kommersant.ru, 6 July 2011  Whistleblower's claims  Kolesnikov's letter to Medvedev and subsequent media interviews, including to Novaya Gazeta, David Ignatius of The Washington Post and Masha Gessen of Snob.ru, give the following account of what the whistleblower revealed was known to its participants as \\"Project South\\". In early 2000, Nikolai Terentievich Shamalov, a representative of the multinational company Siemens AG in North West Russia and somebody thought close to Russia's new President Vladimir Putin, approached Kolesnikov with a business proposition. The two men had known each other through business since 1993‚Äì1994, when Kolesnikov was deputy director general of Petromed, a St. Petersburg-based firm that specialised in the procurement of medical supplies. It was also through Petromed that Kolesnikov had got to know Putin, on whose behalf Shamalov said he made the approach. Putin had been head of the St. Petersburg Council on External Economic affairs which when Petromed became a private company in 1992 held a 51% stake. Putin's plan, as delineated by Shamalov to Kolesnikov, was: some extremely wealthy Russian businessmen were to provide large sums of money which were to be spent on improving Russia's healthcare infrastructure. They included Roman Abramovich ($203 million) and Alexei Mordashov ($14.9 million). It was arranged that a donation, in the first instance from Abramovich's Pole of Hope charity to the Sergei Kirov Military Medical Academy, would be directed to Petromed as the contractor for the modernisation programme. Kolesnikov said that 15‚Äì20% of its contracts with suppliers went to Siemens, run by Shamalov. However, Putin stipulated that 35% of the funds should be held in offshore accounts rather than spent on the projects for which they were ostensibly intended. The source of these funds was invisible, because Petromed negotiated discounts from its suppliers (including Siemens) which it did not pass on, claiming that it had paid more than it actually had. Thus, according to Kolesnikov, Petromed claimed to have spent Abramovich's $203 million, but in fact spent $130 million. The remaining $70 million was deposited in Switzerland, under Shamalov's control. Kolesnikov estimates that by 2007 $500 million had accumulated in Switzerland. In 2005, when around $200 million had been reached, Rosinvest, a subsidiary of the Swiss registered company Lirus Management, was established to invest the money in Russia. Putin allegedly held 94% of shares in Rosinvest, with Kolesnikov, Shamalov and Dmitry Vladimirovich Gorelov (director of Petromed and another friend of Putin from his time in Saint Petersburg) taking 2% each. Rosinvest's interests included shipbuilding, construction, and lumber/timber processing. Kolesnikov is reported as saying that Abramovich and the other donors to health projects acted 'nobly', implying they were unaware that a significant proportion of their donations was being diverted into an investment vehicle allegedly run for the benefit of the President and his partners in Rosinvest. This is despite the huge sums involved and disputed claims that the relationship between Putin and Abramovich has been very close. 'Project South', directed by Shamalov, was less mainstream as an 'investment project'. Part one, begun in 2005, was a small 'wellness centre' located at Praskoveevka in 73.96 hectares of protected forest; part two, begun in 2007, was a vineyard in the same area. In the aftermath of the 2008 world financial crisis funds were redirected to Project South from Rosinvest's other projects to facilitate its expansion. It was no longer to be a small 'wellness centre', as the photographs published online by RuLeaks.net show. By this stage, Praskoveevka was home to an Italianate palace of tens of thousands of square metres with casino, winter theatre, summer amphitheatre, church, swimming pools, sports grounds, heliports, landscaped parks, tea houses, staff apartments and technological buildings. Kolesnikov pointedly described it as a modern version of the Peterhof Palace, built on the orders of Peter the Great, and believes that by October 2009 the costs of construction (by the state company Spetsstroi) had reached $1 billion. In addition, it is alleged that money from the state budget was used to provide the complex with infrastructure ‚Äì a gas supply pipeline, an electric power line, and a new mountain road. Kolesnikov claims that in 2009 he and others were barred from the project when he objected to Shamalov's circumvention of customs regulations for supplies for the complex. Kolesnikov has expressed the view that the whole scheme was from the outset a balance between good and evil, but that in 2009 the closure of sensible investment projects in favour of the palace was a step too far. He claims that this order came from Putin, to whom he would give progress reports on Rosinvest. He alleges that Shamalov was sacked by Siemens for not answering bribery allegations but in 2009 was registered as the owner of the complex via the companies Indokopas and Rirus.  Financing  The chart below shows the scheme of interaction between companies and cash flows involved in financing of the construction. Scheme of interaction between companies and cash flows involved in financing of the construction of \\"Putin's Palace\\" Significant financial activity shown on this chart: # Construction of \\"Putin's Palace\\" ‚Äì estimated cost of construction $1 billion, sold by Nikolai Shamalov for $350 million to Alexander Ponomarenko in 2011, # Purchase of shares in Bank Rossiya by Nikolai Shamalov and Dmitry Gorelov. Total share as of 2006: Dmitry Gorelov 12.6%, Nikolay Shamalov 12.6% (see: history of Bank Rossiya). As of 1 April 2015 banks assets were worth 508 billion rubles (ranked 17 in Russia, see Bank Rossiya ‚Äì assets worth), # Purchase of shares in Sogaz, a big insurance company in Russia. 12.5% by Accept Ltd (owned by grandson of Vladimir Putin's uncle Michael Shelomov) and 51% by JSC ABRos Investment Company wholly owned by Bank Rossiya (see: subsidiaries of Bank Rossiya), # Various investments projects in Russia: Vyborg Shipyards, Medical Module Production in Cherepovets, Vineyard in Gelandzhik, Maritime Wharf. Kolesnikov claims that in 2009 development of new investment projects was closed in favour of the palace construction, # Money from the state budget and state-owned companies was used to provide the complex with infrastructure (gas supply pipeline, electric power line, new mountain road) despite the fact that officially this was private property.  Official response  On 23 December 2010, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Prime Minister, dismissed Kolesnikov's allegations against Putin as untrue, maintaining that the Washington Post report \\"concerns the ownership connections of various persons and entities, but Putin has never had any relationship to this palace.\\" In February 2011 Vladimir Khozhin listed the official residences operated by the Presidential Property Management Department and asserted that the government does not maintain any residence as described by the media. In April Kozhin admitted Kremlin involvement with the project when he said that his office was contracted by Lirus Management to carry out the contract for the construction of the palace.  Other reports  In February 2011, environmentalists and a journalist visited the site to investigate concerns that the construction violated laws protecting the area's ecology. They report that they were harassed and detained by members of the Federal Protective Service (FSO), the agency responsible for guarding state property and high-ranking officials. Despite the confiscation of their equipment they were able to publish additional photographs of the site. Activists made another sortie into the property in June 2011, when they claimed to have found an illegally constructed marina.

Education  Kulkarni was educated at Jadhavji Anandji High School in Athani, a town in Belgaum district, Karnataka, India. He then attended the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.  Stint with BJP  A former member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Kulkarni joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1996. Of this ideological switch he said, \\"People like me were living in an illusory land. I realised very late in my life that the Marxist ideology is not suitable in India - in fact, I would say it is unsuitable for any corner of the world.\\" As a member of the BJP, he was associated with the India Shining campaign and rode on the inaugural Delhi‚ÄìLahore Bus. He helped former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee write his speeches and in 2008 was acting as a strategist for Lal Krishna Advani, who had influenced his rise within the party. Kulkarni resigned from the BJP in 2009. The electoral defeat suffered by the party, led by Advani, had effectively ended his role with the party and he had also become disenchanted with the influence exerted by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on party decision-making. In January 2012, he was reported to be once more working full-time for the BJP, on this occasion as an advisor to its president, Nitin Gadkari. He had been working for the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank, prior to this.  Blitz  Kulkarni worked as executive editor for Blitz, a Mumbai-based tabloid format weekly that was edited and owned by Russi Karanjia. According to Kulkarni, Karanjia was sympathetic to the communist movement in India but became disillusioned with it and its anti-Hindu secularism. He became a strong sympathiser of the BJP and the Ayodhya movement, which led to Kulkarni being appointed in place of P. Sainath as deputy editor. Kulkarni was tasked with having Blitz reflect Karanjia's new-found sympathies. Kulkarni then transformed Blitz from a left- wing newspaper into a BJP-oriented publication. Hinduja Group  Kulkarni joined the Hinduja Group of Companies as Vice President (Media) in the mid-1990s, at a time when the Hinduja Group's chairman was considering tying up with American newspapers to publish an Indian version. It is reported that the Chairman, Srichand Hinduja noticed Sudheendra Kulkarni's Blitz article praising him as a modern-day 'Chanakya' or political diplomat, and arranged to meet him. Later, he joined the Hinduja Group, and wrote many speeches for the Chairman. The newspaper venture of the Hindua Group never took off, and after a few years of professional wilderness with the Hindujas, Kulkarni resigned to join the BJP. Cash for votes scandal In 2008, a sting operation was carried out that involved Kulkarni and another BJP activist. Later televised and known as the \\"cash-for-votes scandal\\", the operation purported to show a bribe of 10 million rupees being offered to three BJP MPs on behalf of the Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. The alleged bribes were intended to obtain the support of the MPs in the 2008 Lok Sabha Vote of Confidence. Subsequently, both the Kishore Chandra Deo committee ‚Äî a parliamentary panel ‚Äî and the police investigated the arrangements and questioned various participants, including Kulkarni. In 2011, Kulkarni was remanded in judicial custody for a period and in November of that year was released on bail. Attacked by the Shiv Sena On 12 October 2015, Kulkarni was attacked by Shiv Sena activists for organising a book launch for former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri. The Sena alleged that Kulkarni had disrespected Indian soldiers by sharing a stage with Kasuri, and his attackers blackened his face and clothes with black paint. Following the attack, Kulkarni continued with the book launch with his blackened face and clothes. Support for Rahul Gandhi In the run-up to the 2019 elections, Sudheendra Kulkarni switched sides again, and started openly supporting the Congress President Rahul Gandhi as the best candidate for the country's Prime Minister. Citing many problems India faced such as China and Pakistan, he said that Rahul Gandhi, whom he described as a 'leader with a good heart' would become an ideal Prime Minister of India, and openly opposed Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

(1993) Making Democracy Work. Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Princeton University Press. Social capital has been thought of as women's capital as whereas there are gendered barriers to accessing economic capital, women's role in family, and community ensures that they have strong networks. There is potential that the concept can help to bring women's unpaid 'community and household labour',Moser, Caroline (1993) Gender Planning and Development: Theory, Practice and Training London and New York: Routledge vital to survival and development, to the attention of economists. However, research analysing social capital from a gendered perspective is rare, and the notable exceptions are very critical.Molyneux, Maxine (2002) Gender and the Silences of Social Capital: Lessons from Latin America Development and Change 33 (2):167-188Maclean, Kate (2010) 'Capitalising on Women's Social Capital? Women-targeted Microfinance in Bolivia' Development and Change 41 (3) pp 495-515Rankin, K (2002) Social Capital, Microfinance and the Politics of development Feminist Economics 8 (1) pp 1-24 To summarise the debate, it is argued that communitarian theories of social capital naturalise the labour that women put into maintaining social networks and take advantage of rather than valorise their work in the community and family. Communitarian theories of social capital are the most prominent in development literature (mostly inspired by Putnam's 1994 work) and it is assumed that an increase in social capital is inherently good and can support political participation and market efficiency. Social capital is increased by building and fortifying the traditions and norms that underpin reciprocity, co-operation and trust. Whilst this could be seen to valorise the feminised role in maintaining these norms and traditions that is overlooked by development theories based on increasing GDP and getting the prices right, it could also be argued to ossify patriarchal traditions and norms and rely on women's naturalised, unpaid labour in the household and community. Assuming that social capital is inherently good overlooks hierarchies, power dynamics and difference within 'communities' and groups, and that norms can be downward levelling as well as supportive. A Marxist approach, inspired by the work of Pierre Bourdieu (Bourdieu 1985), can bring out the 'downside' to social capital,Mayoux, Linda (2001) 'Tackling the Downside: Social Capital, Women's Empowerment and Microfinance in Cameroon' Development and Change 32 pp 435-464 and is argued to be crucial if the concept of social capital is to valorise rather than exploit women's labour. Network theorists define social capital as 'aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network' (Bourdieu, 1985: 248), allowing the relationship between social networks and economic resources to be examined, and potentially exploitative or restrictive traditions, norms and relationships to be identified. Other critics claim that the concept of social capital is wholly inappropriate to the feminist project. Rather than being trapped in a paradigm that feminists have sought to problematise, gendered critiques of value and the economy would do better to draw on the work of Foucault than Bourdieu (Adkins 2005), or focus on economic diversity rather than how social capital supports capitalo-centric development (Gibson Graham 1996). However, given the prominence of social capital on the development agenda and the plethora of policy and academic work that refers to the term, it seems vital that the gendered dimensions of the debate be highlighted.

Hesperidanthus argillaceus) is a rare species of flowering plant in the mustard family known by the common names clay reed- mustard, Uinta Basin plainsmustard, and clay thelypody. Distribution The plant is endemic to northeastern Utah in the Western United States, where it is known only from within Uintah County.Schoenocrambe argillacea. The Nature Conservancy. This mustard grows in the Uinta Basin on the Green River Formation, a geological formation near the edge of the Uinta Formation, both of the Colorado Plateau region. The habitat is rocky, with steep cliffs of gypsum-rich clay covered in a layer of sandstone scree. The ground is bedrock or shale barrens littered with loose rock and fine soils. The plants grow in exposed areas and in sheltered areas on these barren slopes, the largest plants occurring in protected nooks in the rock. The area is a desert shrub plant community. Other plants in the habitat include Torrey's jointfir (Ephedra torreyana), shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), Nuttall's horsebrush (Tetradymia nuttallii), Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier utahensis), black sagebrush (Artemisia nova), lesser rushy milkvetch (Astragalus convallarius), Mojave brickellbush (Brickellia oblongifolia), yellow rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), cushion buckwheat (Eriogonum ovalifolium), Fendler's sandmat (Euphorbia fendleri), granite prickly phlox (Linanthus pungens), fleshy beardtongue (Penstemon carnosus), rock goldenrod (Petradoria pumila), northern Indian parsnip (Cymopterus terebinthinus), Indian ricegrass (Stipa hymenoides), and shortspine horsebrush (Tetradymia spinosa). Description Schoenocrambe argillacea is a perennial herb with one or more erect stems growing 13 to 30 centimeters tall from a caudex. The leaves are linear in shape, long and narrow with smooth edges, and reach up to 4 centimeters in length.Hesperidanthus argillaceus. Flora of North America. The leaves are fleshy and have a white waxy coating. The inflorescence is a raceme of mustardlike flowers. Each flower has purple sepals and four centimeter-long white or pale purple petals with purple veining. The fruit is a curved silique roughly 2 to 5 centimeters long. Conservation The plant is federally listed as a Critically endangered species of the United States. Schoenocrambe argillacea is limited to a small section of the Uinta basin in Uintah County. There are six or seven occurrences of the plant, making up three populations. The total number of plants is under 10,000.Schoenocrambe argillacea. Center for Plant Conservation. The main threat to this rare plant is oil and gas exploration in its habitat, and, potentially the mining of the oil shale that occurs under the whole area of the plant's distribution. Another threat is the use of off-road vehicles in the habitat.

Frank La Forge at the piano, 1915 Frank La Forge at the piano, 1915 Biography He was born on October 22, 1879 in Rockford, Illinois. La Forge was a boy soprano.Villamil, p. 254 He first studied piano with his older sister, and went to Vienna in 1900 to study with Theodor Leschetizky. He recorded prolifically for the Victor Talking Machine Company, as both a soloist and accompanist starting in 1906. As a soloist, he recorded works by Chopin, Liszt and MacDowell. In performance he usually accompanied entirely from memory, considered an unusual feat for an accompanist. In his biography Pathways of Song, La Forge claimed that he had 'a repertoire of over five thousand memorized accompaniments embracing all schools'.Pathways of Song He toured Europe, Russia, and the United States as an accompanist to Marcella Sembrich. La Forge moved to New York City in 1920, where he became a music teacher, coach, and accompanist. He taught a number of important American singers, including Marian Anderson, Lawrence Tibbett, Marie Powers, Emma Otero and Richard Crooks. He served as accompanist for many vocal stars and instrumentalists of the day including Johanna Gadski, Ernestine Schumann-Heink and Margaret Matzenauer. His longstanding musical relationship with Metropolitan Opera soprano Lily Pons from 1937 until his death, saw the production of recital tours with flutist Frank Versaci, down the eastern seaboard and in British Columbia. Frank La Forge died at the piano, performing at a Musicians Club of New York dinner in Manhattan on May 5, 1953, for which he had been president since 1935.Villamil, p. 255 Musical works La Forge composed around 40 songs for voice and piano in the years between 1906 and 1940, as well as a few piano solos, choral works, and at least one solo for violin and piano. Some of the songs are sacred, and most were published individually by G. Schirmer, while a few have been reissued in various song anthologies and collections of American art songs from the same publisher. Many of his early songs were composed to German texts and modeled on the German Lied. Later songs were composed in the more accessible 'concert ballad' style, which was quite popular at the time. Many were written for specific singers to show off their individual talents. The songs are known for their craftsmanship, full piano accompaniments, and tasteful musical style. His 1919 piece Song of the Open was highlighted by Upton as representative of American song from the era 1900-1930.Upton, p. 177 He was also a highly successful arranger of folksongs; Villamil mentions 'an excellent set of Mexican folk songs'. Perhaps more significant was his work as an important compiler of songs for students, in the collection of several volumes he created with Will Earhart, the Pathways of Song.

According to the Post Office the population of the 2011 Census was included in the civil parish of Dummer. The area was occupied from pre-historic times and was established as a permanent habitation during the Roman occupation of Britain. The manor of Popham was established by the monastery of Winchester as an outlying agricultural grain station. A small church and school were later established, but have long since disappeared. The parish and hamlet were later dissected by the M3 Motorway and A303 trunk road.

The nuclear reactor core is where the nuclear reactions take place. Because the reactions are exothermic, cool water is needed to prevent the reactor core from melting down. The core shroud helps by directing this cool water towards the reactor core, providing stability to the nuclear reactions.  Structure  The core shroud is composed of multiple cylindrical thermal shields stacked on top of each other. In between each thermal shield is a horizontal, stainless steel cylindrical plate that helps keep the thermal shields in place. The plates are then welded together with the thermal shields so that they create one solid structure. Vertical tie bolts are then used to reinforce each horizontal plate with their adjacent thermal shields, stabilizing the cylindrical core shroud. The thermal shields are needed because the core shroud exists near the nuclear reactor core where heat is constantly present. The thermal shields prevent heat from damaging the core shroud by absorbing or reflecting the heat. Core shroud walls are relatively thin, ranging from three to five centimeters in thickness. This is because the core shroud is not built to withstand high amounts of pressure for long periods of time, so thicker walls would be unnecessary for the core shroud's function.  Function   Direction of Water Flow  The main function of the core shroud is to direct the current of water flow inside of the reactor pressure vessel. Cold water is pumped into the reactor pressure vessel from an outside water source. The cold water flows down in between the wall of the reactor pressure vessel and the outside wall of the core shroud where it meets the fuel assemblies. It is here that the cold water is heated, and the heated water flows back up the gap between the wall of the reactor pressure vessel and the outside wall of the core shroud. This creates steam, since the water is heated, which is then used to drive the steam turbine, which powers the generator and creates electricity. By directing the cold water into the reactor pressure vessel, and allowing the heated water to rise and evaporate, the core shroud will have successfully cooled the nuclear reactions.  Water Level  In order for the reactor core to remain cool, water is sometimes needed in greater amount, resulting in a flood like effect in the reactor vessel itself. The core shroud must be able to maintain its strength when the vessel floods so that the reactor core does not melt down. The core shroud must be built to withstand the pressure of extra water because should it collapse, the fuel assemblies would not be able to cool properly.  Maintenance  In 1990, Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) was discovered in core shrouds, resulting in a heightened awareness of core shroud maintenance. Routine core shroud inspections became mandatory in most nuclear power plants worldwide because if a core shroud were to collapse, a nuclear meltdown could occur. Core shrouds crack because the heat from the nuclear reactions combined with the constant flowing water eventually wear out the steel plates. One method used to fix this problem is reinforcing the core shroud plates. This is done using an anchor bolt, which is used to attach additional steel plates to the core shroud surface, thereby reinforcing the structure. This is the most common method used to fix cracks in the core shroud since it is easy and relatively safe. Replacement of the core shroud is also an option, but it is not recommended because the cracked plates must be removed manually, leaving the laborers susceptible to radiation. In the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, cracks had been discovered in their core shrouds. In this specific event, however, core shroud cracking was not the cause of the nuclear disaster. Several other factors, such as the earthquake, tsunami, and equipment failures, caused the most damage to the nuclear power plant. It has been speculated that if a core shroud were to collapse due to cracking, it could result in a catastrophic nuclear meltdown.

He composed this Christmas cantata in Leipzig in 1724 for the second day of Christmas and first performed it on 26 December 1724. The chorale cantata is based on the hymn by Martin Luther \\"Christum wir sollen loben schon\\".  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in his second year in Leipzig for the Second Day of Christmas. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Epistle to Titus (), the Acts of the Apostles ( and ), and the Gospel of Luke (). The source for the melody is Martin Luther's setting of the hymn \\"Christum wir sollen loben schon\\", a German translation of the Latin \\"A solis ortus cardine\\" (c. 430). The opening chorus is its first verse and the closing chorale is its eighth verse, both unchanged. The hymn's other verses are freely adapted as madrigalian recitatives and arias by an unknown poet.  Scoring and structure  The piece is scored for alto, tenor and bass vocal soloists with four-part choir. The instrumental parts are cornett, three trombones, oboe d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The cantata has six movements: # Chorus: Christum wir sollen loben schon # Aria (tenor): O du von Gott erh√∂hte Kreatur # Recitative (alto): Der Gnade unermesslich's Wesen # Aria (bass): Johannis freudenvolles Springen # Recitative (soprano): Doch wie erblickt es dich in deiner Krippe # Chorale: Lob, Ehr und Dank sei dir gesagt  Music  The early-church melody on which BWV 121's opening chorus and closing chorale are based The opening choral motet is built on a quasi-church mode cantus firmus in the soprano, with an archaic effect underscored by a full four-part brass accompaniment. The instruments, other than the continuo, largely double the vocal lines; these and the continuo assume a contrapuntal role. Bach uses fugal techniques and an extended final cadence. It begins in E minor and, unusually, closes a tone higher in F-sharp minor. The tenor aria is composed as a modern da capo aria, in which the symmetrical scheme is broken up by irregular periodising and harmonization. It includes a very prominent oboe d'amore part. The movement is largely in B minor. Craig Smith remarks that the aria is \\"marvelously off- kilter\\". The third movement is an alto recitative. It ends with a \\"startling enharmonic progression ‚Äì a symbolic transformation\\" to C major. The bass aria is almost dance-like, playing with the harmony and portraying jumps, reflecting the movement's text's references to John the Baptist's leaping in his mother's womb during the Visitation of Mary. The binary-form string ritornello repeats four times during the aria, framing three separate vocal sections of the da capo aria. The penultimate movement is a soprano recitative, short and arioso-like. It is remarkable for its extended range. The closing chorale movement presents the doxology in a four-part setting, illuminating the early-church melody in a modern major-minor tonality. Unusually, the piece ends on a B minor imperfect cadence.  Recordings  * M√ºnchener Bach-Chor / M√ºnchener Bach-Orchester, Karl Richter. Bach Cantatas Vol. 1.

Etymology The Latin name of the species ' means purple and blue, referred to the changing colour of the flowers with the progress of flowering. Description Close-up on purple-reddish blooms and blue flowers Lithospermum purpurocaerula is a bushy plant that reaches on average of height, with a maximum of . The stem is hairy, erect and unbranched. Leaves are dark green and lanceolate to narrow elliptic, with a prominent midrib on the underside. Flowers are hermaphroditic, funnel-shaped, long and of diameter, clustered in a racemose inflorescence. The blossoms are purple- reddish, then the color of the flowers turns into a deep blue. The flowering period extends from April to June. The fruits are bright white capsules, long, with a glossy surface. They are very hard (hence the genus synonym Lithospermum, meaning \\"stone seed\\" for the hardness of these capsules). Distribution This species is widespread in British Isles, in central Europe up to South Russia and in Mediterranean countries from Spain to the eastern Turkey. Habitat Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum is typically found in dry and warm forests with sparse deciduous vegetation, in the meadows on the edge of the wood, in hedgerows and scrublands. The plants prefer calcareous soils rich in humus, at an altitude of above sea level. Uses Before the introduction of synthetic dyes to Meiji period Japan, the roots of lithospermum purpurocaeruleum were commonly used as a dyestuff for luxury textiles, typically high-end kimono and . The process of extracting purple dyestuff from the roots was an exceedingly long, complex and time-consuming process, necessitating its relatively high expense: > The roots [of the plant] are collected and dried for two to three months to > mature the color. While this occurs, the silk is pre-mordanted...the > mordanting process involves repeated immersion of the cloth or yarn in the > alum bath and drying over a two- ir three-month period. To prepare the > dyestuff, the gromwell roots are softened overnight in 60¬∞[celsius] water > and then pounded to release the dye. The silk is then repeatedly immersed in > the bath, aired to allow more oxygen to penetrate the cloth and then steeped > in the dye until the desired color is achieved. When the dyeing is completed > the cloth is placed in dark storage for as long as a year while the color > continues to mature. The resulting shades of purple produced by lithospermum purpurocaeruleum were referred to as , a name taken from the author of The Tale of Genji, . Additional terms were used for specific shades of purple within this range, particularly during the Heian period; names such as (\\"pale purple\\") and (\\"light purple\\") formed important distinctions when dressing in specifically- layered clothing, and could also indicate (typically high) rank.

Working most of the time in Nice, in his last decades Sosno achieved international recognition for his monumental outdoor sculptures in C√¥te d'Azur, France. Along with: Yves Klein, Arman and Cesar he was part of the New Realist (Nouveau r√©alisme) movement . Sosno had a singular artistic approach: the concept of obliteration. His sculptures are masked by empty or full space, inviting the viewer to use his own imagination.  Biography  \\"Sosno, Grande Venus, 1984 Sosno was born in Marseilles. His father was Estonian and his mother was French. Sosno spend his childhood in Riga, Latvia. During World War II, his family managed to escape to Switzerland and later to France. He began painting in 1948 when he was inspired by his neighbour Henri Matisse but stopped in 1956. In 1958 he studied in Paris (political science & oriental languages) following courses at the Law Faculty and at the Cinema Institute at the Sorbonne. In 1961 went back to Nice and founded the magazine \\"Sud Communications\\" (Eng: Southern Communications), in which he then published his first theory of the \\"School of Nice\\". Shortly afterwards, he began his long friendship with Martial Raysse. In the 1960s after a term of Military service in Toulouse and stints as a war reporter in Ireland, Bangladesh and Biafra, Sosno returned to painting. In 1974 he sold his art studio in Paris in order so that was free to cross the Atlantic by sailboat. Then three years later Sosno returned to France to make his first sculpture, \\"Obliterated Cars\\". In 1983 Sosno was the subject of a one-man show at the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Nice. Then in the year following he had his first one-man show in the United States at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield, Connecticut. IN 1986 The Galerie Beaubourg in Paris commissioned a piece from the artist. Between 1986 and 1988 Sosno developed several projects which brought together sculpture and architecture, including the Hotel Elys√©e Palace (today running under Marriott flag and named AC Hotel Nice) with architect Georges Margarita, a 28-meter high work, which incorporates a 19-meter high bronze and 420 tons of granite. In 1989 and 1990 he had four one-man shows in the U.S.: in the Floridian cities of Miami, West Palm Beach, Sarasota and Tampa. Then in the nineteen nineties the artist set up his workshop on the hills of Nice where he planted vines and olive trees. In the last decades many international exhibitions of his work were stage in nations such as France, Russia, China and Italy. Sosnp's most recognizable work remains the \\"T√™te Carr√©e\\" (square head building) library in Nice, France which he completed in 2002 in collaboration with the architects; Yves Bayard and Francis Chapus.  Style  Sosno's work has been termed l'art d'oblit√©r or the ‚Äòart of obliteration‚Äô as a result of his idiosyncratic voids or solids added to an artwork, which obliterate or distort the full picture or figure. Thus giving the viewer the task of imagining what is absent: \\"I only do 50% of the work; other people have to finish creating the sculpture\\". His pieces frequently display either the absence of material or an obstructing addition. For example, in \\"Tete aux quatre vents femme\\", Sosno removed sections of the bronze work, leaving holes where the face, ears and back of the head ought to be. This requires the audience to use its imagination in constructing the full image. Sosno's creative work is self-sufficient, soaring and martial, cultural, a protest.  Architecture (Inhabited sculpture)  Sosno possessed a passion for architecture. He believed architecture must be imbued with the artistic. In 2000 Sosno started to work on \\"T√™te carr√©e\\" (The Square Head), a 26-meter high monumental sculpture ‚Äì the Central Library in Nice with architects Yves Bayard and Francis Chapuis, financed by the Ministry of Culture, the Regional Council, the County Council and the City of Nice. One year later the installation of the aluminium structure began. When the work was completed in 2002 it became the first inhabited monumental sculpture in the world, the first construction entirely in aluminum and the first building shaped and raised thanks to naval techniques.

Biography  Thornton was born in Huddersfield in Yorkshire to tram driver Lewis Thornton and Selina, n√©e Kerry. Selina left Lewis when Ernie was two, and after taking factory and building jobs Thornton was brought to Sydney by the Dreadnought Trust in 1924 and sent to the Government Training Farm at Scheyville. He was subsequently a construction worker and became a militant unionist. The Great Depression left him unemployed, and this led him to join the Communist Party of Australia (CPA). On 9 August 1934 he married Alice Mary \\"Lila\\" Felstead, n√©e Curtis, who was divorced with two sons, at Collins Street in Melbourne. Thornton was elected as an organiser in the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia (FIA) in 1935. By 1936 he was part-time general secretary, and also a member of the CPA's central committee. Following the recovery of the economy in the late 1930s Thornton was made full-time general secretary and moved to Sydney. Thornton's position in the FIA was threatened in the 1946 union elections when the Balmain branch, backed by the Labor Industrial Groups, ran a rival ticket headed by Laurie Short. Thornton won but Short took the case to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, which found that \\"persons unknown\\" had rigged the ballot, leaving Short as National Secretary. Thornton resigned in 1950 to become Australasia's representative at the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) liaison bureau in Peking, but he was left without a job when the Australian Council of Trade Unions withdrew recognition of the WFTU. The FIA refused to accept him back and Thornton was employed full-time by the Communist Party. A decline in party finances led to his return to manual labour as a crane driver, becoming honorary president of the Sydney branch of the Federated Engine Drivers' and Firemen's Association of Australasia. He died at Lidcombe in 1969 of myocardial infarction.

In the essay Tagore offered critique on the Gandhian ethic of \\"charkha-spinning\\" as an activity which could rejuvenate the Indian masses during the Indian independence movement.  Context  Gandhi and Tagore in 1940 Rabindranath Tagore and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi were among the two most influential Indian figures during the freedom struggle of the Indian nation against the colonial rule of the British. Tagore became the first non-European to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 and was instrumental in reshaping Bengali literature and music. He was considered widely as a colossus of the Indian intelligentsia. Gandhi on the other hand emerged as the pre-eminent political and ideological leader of India during the Indian independence movement. He was a mobilizer of the masses and respected and venerated across India as the ‚ÄòMahatma‚Äô (or Great Soul). Incidentally, Tagore is said to have accorded and popularized this title for Gandhi. The two men had great mutual respect for each other but often differed significantly on some issues. One such issue was Gandhi's call for spinning the charkha as an activity which was to be the locus of the Swadeshi and Non-cooperation movement. Tagore did not view this as a beneficial exercise and wrote the essay \\"The Cult of the Charkha\\" as a critique against it. In the Indian context, this text is of immense value as it offers a dialogue on the role of machinery, nature of labor and its role in rejuvenating the intellectual life of the nation.  The problem of repetition  Tagore begins by stating that in the Indian society through the processes of the caste system there has been a \\"leveling down\\" of the masses over the ages. > Every individual of every caste has his function assigned to him, together > with the obsession into which he has been hypnotized, that, since he is > bound by some divine mandate, accepted by his first ancestor, it would be > sinful for him to seek relief therefrom. This imitation of the social scheme > of ant-life makes very easy the performance of petty routine duties, but > specially difficult the attainment of manhood‚Äôs estate. It imparts skill to > the limbs of the man who is a bondsman, whose labor is drudgery; but it > kills the mind of a man who is a doer, whose work is creation. So in India, > during long ages past, we have the spectacle of only a repetition of that > which has gone before. -Rabindranath Tagore, \\"The Cult of the Charkha\\"The > Cult of the Charkha (online text) He claims this problem of repetition cuts at the very soul of human spirit and is contrary to the work of God evidenced by the infusion of the human ‚Äòmind‚Äô which is independent and free. The only way that masters in the past have been able to subjugate masses into slavery is by poisoning the mind either by fear or greed or ‚Äòhypnotic texts‚Äô. Tagore believes that the Gandhian ethic of charkha-spinning is simply another device for lulling the human mind into a sort of conformity against the colonial government, and is not the base for any real intellectual or spiritual rejuvenation as claimed by Gandhi. > Human nature has its elasticity; and in the name of urgency, it can be > forced towards a particular direction far beyond its normal and wholesome > limits. But the rebound is sure to follow, and the consequent > disillusionment will leave behind it a desert track of demoralization... ... > I am afraid of a blind faith on a very large scale in the charkha, in the > country, which is so liable to succumb to the lure of short cuts when > pointed out by a personality about whose moral earnestness they can have no > doubt. -Rabindranath Tagore, \\"The Cult of the Charkha\\"  The nature of labor  Tagore considers another argument which has often followed the cult of the charkha, which is the effect of external labor on the mind. Tagore is critical of the impact of manual labor in rejuvenating the mind of the person undertaking it. He brings into question the nature of labor indulged in. Repetitive manual labor routine without innovation and fresh inputs is unlikely to positively impact the intellect. Tagore illustrates this point with the following example: > By doing the same thing day after day mechanical skill may be acquired; but > the mind like a mill-turning bullock will be kept going round and round a > narrow range of habit. That Is why, in every country man has looked down on > work which involves this kind of mechanical repetition. -Rabindranath > Tagore, \\"The Cult of the Charka\\" He further counters any points on the dignity of manual labor, by stating that the survival instinct of man might allow him suppress his intellectual needs, but claiming that there is a comfort in the dignity of the same would be taking it too far. Thus, Tagore negates the positive impact that the hours manual labor while spinning the charkha can have on a person.  The charkha as a symbol  Gandhi spinning yarn, in the late 1920s Another argument which Tagore tackles, is the one where it is suggested that even if the charkha is not playing a larger role in rejuvenating the masses intellectually, at least it provides constructive economic activity at the domestic level. Tagore does not really challenge this argument, but only points out that there can be several such interventions in the personal sphere where one can make a constructive contribution by incorporating a small change in daily habits. He therefore contends, while the spinning of the charkha maybe viewed as an activity which is beneficial by itself, its actual harm is in its undue importance as a symbol over all other such interventions. Furthermore, Tagore does not like the idea of the charkha invading the personal space of the individual, where his idea of leisure is one which must be measured along matrices of constructivity and productivity. Here Tagore makes a theological point by claiming that the ultimate shudra (low caste) is actually the machine, because it is the job of the shudra to facilitate the convenience of man's labor. The idea of privileging a machine as the centre of a man's universe does not appeal much to Tagore.  Relationship with the Mahatma  Tagore addresses Gandhi reverentially in the end of his essay, by proclaiming him as a being of \\"great moral personality\\" and an embodiment of shakti (divine energy) provided to the people of India by providence itself. However, he humbly chooses to differ with Gandhi on the subject of the charkha. Thus, Tagore himself saw the essay as a critique of the politics and ideology of the charkha but in no way as an attack on Gandhi as the leader of the Indian masses. Tagore offers the essay as a personal document on why he does not endorse the Gandhian ethic of the charkha but clarifies that be believes in the larger moral authority of the Mahatma and only prays that the Indian masses can live up to the standards set by him.

The needle on a safety syringe can be detachable or permanently attached. On some models, a sheath is placed over the needle or the needle retracts into the barrel following injection to protect healthcare workers and others from accidental needlestick injuries. Another option is a secondary device, such as Oak Ridge Products needle capper that allows the user, with one hand, to apply a cover over the contaminated needle. The importance of the safety syringe has increased; legislation requiring it or equivalents has been introduced in many nations since needlestick injuries and re-use prevention became the focus of governments and safety bodies. Types There are many types of safety syringes available on the market. Auto Disable (AD) syringes are designed as a single use syringe, with an internal mechanism blocking the barrel once depressed so it cannot be depressed again. The other type of syringe with a re-use prevention feature is the breaking plunger syringe. An internal mechanism cracks the syringe when the plunger is fully depressed to prevent further use. These syringes are only effectively disabled with a full depression of the plunger; users can avoid activating the re-use prevention feature and re-use the syringe. The more effective safety syringes have reuse and needlestick prevention features. A sheath or hood slides over the needle after the injection is completed with a Needlestick Prevention Syringe, which also has a re-use prevention feature (either an auto disable mechanism or breaking plunger). Retractable syringes use either manual or spring-loaded retraction to withdraw the needle into the barrel of the syringe. Some brands of spring-loaded syringes can have a splatter effect, where blood and fluids are sprayed off the cannula from the force of the retraction. Manual retraction syringes are generally easier to depress because there is no resistance from a spring. Alternatives Traditional glass syringes can be re-used once disinfected. Plastic body syringes have become more popular in recent years because they are disposable. Unfortunately, improper disposal methods and re-use are responsible for transferring blood borne diseases. Importance Of the 55 cases documented by the CDC of (non-sex work) occupational transmission of HIV, 90% were from contaminated needles that pierced the skin. The direct cost of needlestick injuries was calculated in a recent study to be between $539 and $672 Million US Dollars. That includes only lab tests, treatment, service and \\"other\\"; it does not take into account lost time and wages for employers and individuals. Legislation United States *Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, effective date 2001 Two lawyers, Mike Weiss and Paul Danzinger, were approached in 1998 by an inventor, Thomas Shaw, who was having trouble selling a safety syringe developed to protect health care workers from accidentally being infected by dirty needles. The problems were due to monopolistic actions of a major industry needle maker and hospital group purchasing organizations. The case was settled before trial for $150 million.

Description Pocilloporids are colonial and most species are reef-building. They are very variable in size and shape, some being submassive and others arborescent or ramose. The corallites are small and vary from being sunken to being raised cones. The columellae are well developed and the septa may be fused with them. The coenosteum lining the skeleton is covered with spinules. The Pocilloporidae are closely related to the other coral families, Astrocoeniidae and Acroporidae. Biology The genera in this family are polymorphic, differing in growth form according to their habitat, but showing similar growth forms in response to light availability and wave action. The colonies are hermaphrodites. The sperm is liberated into the sea and finds its way into other polyps. After internal fertilisation, the planula larvae are brooded by the parent before being ejected into the water column. This means the dispersal distances are small, but the likelihood of finding a suitable substrate on which to settle are raised.Pocillopora inflata IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

In 1804 Gordon made a grand tour of Egypt, carving his name on many ancient monuments. He returned home via Gibraltar where he boarded HMS Victory, which also brought home the mortal remains of Admiral Horatio Nelson. He arrived back in England in December 1805. Gordon became major on 11 August 1808 and lieutenant-colonel on 6 June 1820. Roger O. De Keersmaecker \\"AN EARLY SCOTTISH TRAVELLER IN EGYPT (In search of John Gordon 1804)\\" On the death of his father in 1814, Gordon inherited his estates including Cluny Castle; he was already a wealthy man as he also succeeded to his uncle's estate, who had been a merchant in West India. He purchased further properties, including North and South Uist, Benbecula and Barra. He was described by architectural historian H. Gordon Slade as a \\"model landlord\\" to tenants on his Aberdeenshire properties, although he was responsible for the expelling of tenants in the Highland Clearances from the islands. Tenants from his estates on the Outer Hebrides (around 3000 people) were made to emigrate to Canada in 1851. After the British government introduced the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 Gordon received a compensation payment from it of ¬£24,964. His six plantations in the Caribbean island of Tobago had 1383 slaves. Gordon was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis from 1826 to 1832. He became an Honorary Colonel in 1836. Gordon died a bachelor without legal issue in 1858; of his illegitimate children, John, his eldest son, was the only one to outlive him.

For other information about the professional soccer club based in Utah, please see the main article. 2004 Dave Checketts, the founder of Real Salt Lake On July 14, Major League Soccer officially awarded its 12th franchise to the state of Utah and ownership group SCP Worldwide, headed by Dave Checketts. Steve Pastorino was named general manager of the new team, and John Ellinger was hired as head coach. The team was officially named \\"Real Salt Lake\\" in October of that year in honor to Real Madrid. The announcement was met with some discontenthttp://www.deseretnews.com/cgi- bin/cqcgi_plus/@plus.env?CQ_SESSION_KEY=RTNYEDTWUYCG&CQ;_CUR_DOCUMENT=30&CQ;_TEXT_MAIN=YES among local soccer fans (see main article), but overall, the community remained excited about the new team. On November 17, RSL acquired the first player in club history, trading with Dallas Burn for star forward Jason Kreis. Over the following months, the team added several players, including decorated MLS veterans Clint Mathis and Eddie Pope. Also, the team made arrangements to play home matches at Rice-Eccles Stadium on the campus of the University of Utah, with hopes of eventually building a soccer-specific stadium in the Salt Lake area to host matches in the future. 2005 The team played its first official match on April 2, slogging through a windy, rain-soaked contest against New York MetroStars at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. That match ended as a scoreless draw. The following week, Jason Kreis scored the first goal in franchise history in a 3‚Äì1 loss to LA Galaxy at the Home Depot Center. RSL returned to Utah to play its first-ever home match on April 16. With 25,287 fans present at Rice-Eccles Stadium, Brian Dunseth scored a header in the 81st minute to deliver a 1‚Äì0 victory over the rival Colorado Rapids.http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700264165/Real-Salt-Lake-Things- have-changed-a-lot-since-05-opener.html The RSL faithful were thrilled, but from that point on, the season was mostly frustration and disappointment. The team did log back-to-back victories in May, but high hopes were quickly dashed as RSL's offense sputtered. The team set a league record by posting a 557-minute scoreless streak (later broken by Toronto FC). Real recovered enough to log back-to-back wins later in the year, but again met with disaster: the team lost 10 consecutive matches before managing a 2‚Äì2 draw on the road against the San Jose Earthquakes. The season ended with a 1‚Äì0 loss at home against Colorado, giving RSL an overall record of 5-22-5 in the franchise's inaugural season. Despite the disappointing season, there were a few highlights. In June, Salt Lake hosted a World Cup qualifier match between Team USA and Costa Rica, drawing a boisterous crowd of 40,586 fans for the double-header at Rice-Eccles Stadium.http://www.mlssoccer.com/content/landon- donovan-kasey-keller-power-united-states-3-0-world-cup-qualifier-victory-over- costa-r In August, Kreis notched his 100th career goal, becoming the first player in MLS history to reach that milestone. 2006 Real Salt Lake's sophomore season began much the way the rookie campaign ended. The team recorded five losses and one tie in the first six matches of the season. Overall, RSL had gone 18 consecutive matches without a victory ‚Äì the longest winless streak in MLS history. But despite hitting rock-bottom, the team responded positively. On May 13, RSL routed LA Galaxy 3‚Äì0, with two goals scored by newly acquired forward Jeff Cunningham. It was the first road victory in team history. A three-game homestand produced two wins and a tie, and suddenly Real looked like a playoff contender. However, their fortunes changed quickly, with four losses and two ties in the next six matches. Yet RSL rebounded again, posting five wins, one tie, and just one loss from mid- July to mid-August. But the roller coaster season hit a low point with a demoralizing 6‚Äì0 loss at the hands of New York Red Bulls. The team managed two wins and four draws in the last eight matches, but failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing with a 10-13-9 record. Cunningham provided most of Real's highlights during the up-and-down 2006 season. He had come to Salt Lake from Colorado - in exchange for Mathis, who had been a major disappointment for RSL. Cunningham earned the MLS Golden Boot by scoring a league-high 16 goals. He also added 11 assists, tied for the second-highest total in the MLS. Despite mixed results on the field, RSL scored a huge victory off the field in 2006. After much controversy and debate (see main article), the franchise finally secured a guarantee for a state-of-the-art, soccer-specific stadium to be built in Sandy ‚Äì a suburb of Salt Lake City. The team broke ground for the structure on the morning of August 12, with representatives from soccer giant Real Madrid present, including superstar David Beckham. That evening, RSL faced its namesake in front of a sellout crowd of 45,511 fans at Rice-Eccles Stadium. Salt Lake made a good showing, but Real Madrid won the exhibition match, 2‚Äì0. In September 2006, representatives from Real Salt Lake and Real Madrid signed a 10-year agreement in which the two clubs agreed to work together to promote soccer throughout both Utah and the United States. Among the provisions included in the deal were a biennial friendly match between the two teams in Salt Lake City; annual February training for the RSL squad at Real Madrid's practice facility in Spain, and the creation of a $25 million youth academy in Salt Lake City that would train up to 200 youth players ranging from ages 12 to 18.Salt Lake Tribune article announcing the RSL-RM deal However, the deal has seemed to have been dissolved, as none of the agreed upon provisions have come true: only one friendly match was ever played between the two sides, in 2006 (which the Madrid side won 2‚Äì0), and the planned soccer complex between the two has not come to fruition, with Salt Lake opening an academy on its own in Casa Grande, Arizona in 2010. 2007 The 2007 season opened with high hopes. Real Salt Lake boasted a formidable attack with Cunningham and Kreis up front, joined by recently signed Panamanian international Luis Tejada. They were supported by veteran talent in the midfield and defense, such as Chris Klein, Carey Talley, and newly arrived goalkeeper Nick Rimando. But most of the pre-season buzz surrounded up-and- coming young players in the midfield. Mehdi Ballouchy returned after a solid rookie season in 2006, and RSL acquired highly touted Freddy Adu in an off- season trade with D.C. United. At just 17 years old, Adu was already a three- year MLS veteran and was thought by some to be the future star of American soccer. But the club's excitement quickly gave way to disappointment. In the first match of the season, RSL controlled throughout, but a fluke goal by Carlos Ruiz in the final minute of stoppage time salvaged a 2‚Äì2 draw for FC Dallas on Real's home turf. RSL was devastated by the crushing result. The players appeared lifeless as they were outscored 6‚Äì0 in their next three games. In a stunning move, Ellinger was firedhttp://www.deseretnews.com/article/695198790/Tireless-Ellinger-setting- sails.html and replaced by Kreis, who immediately retired as a player. Also, general manager Steve Pastorino resigned and was later replaced by Garth Lagerwey. The franchise launched a massive re-construction project that continued throughout the year. Cunningham ‚Äì who had feuded with Kreis on more than one occasion ‚Äì was traded to Toronto. Tejada was out-of-shape and played just two minutes for RSL before being released. Adu left mid-season to pursue a career in Portugal. By the end of the year, several other key players ‚Äì such as Ballouchy and Klein ‚Äì had been traded away. In addition, veteran defender Eddie Pope retired. The team finished with a disappointing 6-15-9 record, missing the playoffs yet again. 2008 Although the previous season seemed like a giant step backwards for RSL, the team added several players in 2007 that provided a foundation for future success. Kyle Beckerman, Robbie Findley, and Yura Movsisyan came to Salt Lake via trades from other MLS teams, while Fabi√°n Esp√≠ndola and Javier Morales were brought from their native Argentina to bolster the offensive attack. Early in 2008, the club added central defenders Nat Borchers and Jamison Olave to solidify the backline. Rimando held off rookie Chris Seitz to remain the team's first-choice goalkeeper. As Real established chemistry together, they emerged as a force to be reckoned with ‚Äì at least in Salt Lake. RSL marched through the regular season with just one loss at home, against eight wins and six ties. The team's home field advantage improved dramatically in October with the opening of Rio Tinto Stadium, the new soccer-specific stadium in Sandy. However, road matches were a different story: RSL posted a dismal 2-9-4 record outside the state of Utah. But when they desperately needed a road result in the last match of the regular season, the team came up big. Movsisyan scored on a rebound shot in the 90th minute to secure a 1‚Äì1 draw in Colorado, good enough to clinch the first-ever playoff spot in franchise history. 2008 marked the first non-losing season for the club, as Real finished with a 10-10-10 record. Also, Movsisyan's late strike gave the team a positive goal differential (40 goals for, 39 against) for the first time ever. RSL advanced past Chivas USA in the first round, winning 1‚Äì0 at home and drawing 2‚Äì2 on the road. However, the season ended in disappointing fashion, as New York Red Bulls handed RSL a rare home loss in the Western Conference Final, ending Real's postseason run. Despite the setback, optimism ran high in the organization, knowing that the team was moving in the right direction. Beckerman provided strong leadership as team captain, and Morales emerged as the spearhead of the offense, setting a team record with 15 assists during the regular season. 2009 The team and fans had hoped for dramatic improvement in 2009; however, the season progressed in much the same way as 2008. Again, RSL proved nearly invincible at home, posting a 9-1-5 record in Rio Tinto Stadium, with a record-setting +23 goal differential. However, yet again, the team struggled to maintain form during road matches. In the final few weeks, RSL found itself in a five-way battle for the final two spots in the MLS playoffs ‚Äì and Salt Lake had the fewest points of the five teams. However, thanks to a 3‚Äì0 victory over Colorado in the final game of the regular season ‚Äì combined with a miraculous series of results in several other matches around the league ‚Äì RSL clinched the 8th and final position in the playoffs. Despite finishing with a losing record overall (11-12-7), the team was granted the last spot over two other teams through a tie-breaker formula (the Rapids and D.C. United also finished the year with 40 points each). As a \\"reward\\" for qualifying, RSL faced the top-seeded Columbus Crew in the Eastern Conference bracket. Led by Guillermo Barros Schelotto, the Crew stood as the defending MLS champions, in addition to owning the best record in the league during the recent regular season. Salt Lake therefore entered the two-match first round series as heavy underdogs. Still, the team was not intimidated. They used their strong home field advantage to post a 1‚Äì0 victory in the first match, and fought valiantly in the second leg, overcoming a 2‚Äì0 deficit to stun the Crew (3-2) in Columbus. Having advanced on aggregate, Real now faced the Chicago Fire in the second round. With Mexican superstar Cuauhtemoc Blanco, the Fire would be tough to beat ‚Äì especially in a single match in Chicago, where RSL had never won before. The teams played to a scoreless draw, and Salt Lake emerged victorious in the shootout (5-4) thanks to 3 huge saves by Rimando. As improbable as it seemed, RSL claimed the Eastern Conference championship and advanced to face the LA Galaxy in the final match for the MLS Cup. Over 46,000 fans packed into Seattle's Qwest Field to watch one of the most highly anticipated finals in MLS history. The two teams were polar opposites. The Galaxy were a well- established franchise, boasting several previous championships, in the giant metro area of Los Angeles. Their roster included David Beckham ‚Äì arguably the most famous athlete in the world at the time ‚Äì along with American superstar Landon Donovan, and several other well-known MLS veterans. In contrast, Real Salt Lake was a small-market franchise with very little tradition and no star players. Yet again, they found themselves heavy underdogs, but it was a role they relished. LA Galaxy struck first in the match, but Robbie Findley countered with a rebound shot in the 64th minute. The teams battled to a 1‚Äì1 draw at the end of regulation, and neither team was able to score during the hard-fought overtime. Each keeper made huge saves during the shootout, and the teams remained deadlocked after five rounds of penalty kicks. After Rimando stopped a blast by Edson Buddle in the seventh round, Robbie Russell buried his try, giving Real Salt Lake a 5‚Äì4 victory in the shootout and thus claiming the 2009 MLS Cup championship. Rimando was named MVP for his standout performance as goalkeeper. RSL's title run remains one of the biggest upsets in American soccer, and stands as the only time in the history of major professional sports in the United States in which a team has claimed the league championship despite finishing the regular season with a losing record. Real Salt Lake was formally honored by President Barack Obama at a press conference in the White House on June 4, 2010. 2010 On September 4, 2010, Real Salt Lake tied the MLS record set by the Columbus Crew the year prior (2008‚Äì2009) of 22 straight unbeaten games at home by beating the New York Red Bulls 1‚Äì0. Real Salt Lake has not lost a league game at home since May 2009. On October 16, 2010 Real Salt Lake improved their home unbeaten streak to 25 games in a row after beating the FC Dallas 2‚Äì0. This win gave Real Salt Lake the most consecutive home games without a loss in MLS history.http://www.realsaltlake.com/news/2010/10/rsl-notes-quotes- rsl-2-0-fcdhttp://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/sports/50502703-77/rsl-azul-cruz- paulo.html.csp This streak was ended at 29 games on May 28, 2010, with their loss to the Seattle Sounders FC. RSL simultaneously tied the record for a Single Season Home Unbeaten Streak with zero losses in Rio Tinto Stadium in the 2010 regular season. This tied the only other standing Single Season Home Unbeaten Streak, held by the San Jose Earthquakes in the 2005 season. After a successful first season at the club, √Ålvaro Sabor√≠o was made Salt Lake's first ever Designated Player, signing a four-year contract with the club on December 1, 2010. 2010-11 CONCACAF Champions League As MLS Cup champions, Real Salt Lake were placed in Group A of the 2010-11 CONCACAF Champions League with Cruz Azul of Mexico, Toronto FC of Canada and Arabe Unido of Panama. Real Salt Lake started their CONCACAF Champions League tournament on August 18 at Rio Tinto Stadium playing the Panamanian champions, √Årabe Unido. Real Salt Lake won the game 2‚Äì1 with both goals scored by Alvaro Saborio. Next, Real Salt Lake went down to Mexico City to take on Cruz Azul on August 25. No American team had ever won in Mexico City before, and RSL looked to be the first. Late in the game, RSL had a commanding lead of 3 goals to 1 over Cruz Azul. However, Cruz Azul wasn't about to go down quietly, and within 12 minutes they put four goals on RSL to defeat them 5‚Äì4. On September 15, 2010, Real Salt Lake took on Toronto FC at home, in Rio Tinto Stadium. Toronto struck early in the ninth minute, with a goal by Santos. However, Kyle Beckerman scored in the 21st minute, leading to three more goals throughout the match. RSL won the match 4‚Äì1, and took second place in Group A, behind Cruz Azul. Later that month, on September 22, Real Salt Lake went down to Panama to take on √Årabe Unido for the 2nd time. This time, Real Salt Lake defeated √Årabe Unido 3‚Äì2 on their home soil. Cruz Azul tied with Toronto FC the same night, and so RSL was on top of Group A with 9 points. Cruz Azul had 7 points with two more games for both teams to play. On September 28, Real Salt Lake went north up to Canada to take on Toronto FC for a second time. RSL needed at least one more point to clinch one of the two top spots in their group in order to move on to the next round. The game ended up tying 1-1, giving RSL enough points to clinch the spot. The 6th and final game for the first round of Group A came on October 19, when Cruz Azul came to Rio Tinto Stadium. Both teams stood on top of Group A with 10 points each, and the winner would take top of the group. With mostly second-tier players on the field, Real Salt Lake ended up beating Cruz Azul 3‚Äì1 in front of a record crowd of 20,463 fans, with two goals coming from rookie Paulo Araujo Jr. Real Salt Lake ended the first round at first place in Group A. This win also made Real Salt Lake the first ever MLS club to win its group in the CONCACAF Champions League. After a lackluster 0‚Äì0 tie against the Columbus Crew in Columbus, Real Salt Lake defeated the Crew 4-1 back home on March 1, 2011 at Rio Tinto Stadium to advance to the semifinals. The win over Columbus made Real Salt Lake the first ever American team to advance past the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions League, although two American have previously won the CONCACAF Champions Cup(LA Galaxy and DC United). On March 15, 2011, Real Salt Lake beat Saprissa 2‚Äì0 in the first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Semifinals at Rio Tinto Stadium and then lost 2‚Äì1 in Costa Rica on April 5, 2011. However, this was enough to secure advancement to the CONCACAF Champions League Final by an aggregate score of 3‚Äì2. Also, in doing so Real Salt Lake became the first MLS team to ever reach the CONCACAF Champions League Final. Thanks in part to their performance in the Champions League, RSL became the first American club ever to crack the Top 25 World Rankings at WorldClubRankings.com (in April 2011).World Club Rankings Top 25 - April 18, 2011 On April 20, 2011, Real Salt Lake played their first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Final at Estadio Tecnol√≥gico against CF Monterrey. RSL's Javier Morales was able to score an equalizing goal in the 89th minute, ending the game in a 2‚Äì2 draw. The second leg of the final was held on April 27, 2011, at Rio Tinto Stadium; Monterrey's Humberto Suazo scored the only goal of the game, giving Monterrey a 3-2 aggregate victory. 2011 In their 2011 MLS season, RSL's home unbeaten streak was ended at 29 games on May 28, 2011, with their loss to the Seattle Sounders FC.\\"Sounders end RSL's 29-game home unbeaten streak\\", Deseret News, May 28, 2011. Retrieved September 21, 2015. Real finished the regular season with a (15‚Äì11‚Äì8) record being third in the Western Conference, once again advancing to the MLS Playoffs. RSL defeated Seattle Sounders (3‚Äì2) aggregate in their two-game series, advancing to Face the Los Angeles Galaxy in the Conference Finals. In that game, RSL lost (3‚Äì1) to LA, being eliminated from the playoffs. RSL qualified for the 2012-13 CONCACAF Champions League since LA had won both the 2011 MLS Cup and Supporters' Shield, allowing RSL to compete in the tournament having the next best record. 2012 In 2012, Real had a successful year being second in the Western conference during the regular season. In the playoffs, RSL faced Seattle once again in the semi-finals in a home-and-home series. Their first match was a 0‚Äì0 tie. Seattle defeated Real in the second game (1‚Äì0), having RSL eliminated from the playoffs. In the 2012-13 CONCACAF Champions' League, RSL were placed in Group 2 with Herediano and Tauro. Real couldn't advance past the group stage and were eliminated from the tournament. 2013‚Äìpresent In 2013, Checketts sold his stake in Real Salt Lake to minority owner Dell Loy Hansen. Before the season, the club also traded key players J√°mison Olave, Fabi√°n Esp√≠ndola and Will Johnson. RSL finished the season in second place in the Western Conference with a 16‚Äì10‚Äì8 (W-L-T) record, and reached both the Open Cup and MLS Cup finals, losing both to D.C. United and Sporting Kansas City, respectively. After the season, head coach Jason Kreis left Real Salt Lake to become the first head coach of expansion club New York City FC, with long-time assistant coach Jeff Cassar replacing him at the helm. Despite the departure, the club finished the 2014 season in third in the Western Conference, with a record of 15‚Äì8‚Äì11 totaling 56 points, and qualified for the 2015-16 CONCACAF Champions League. In the MLS Cup Playoffs, RSL was eliminated in the conference semifinals by eventual champions LA Galaxy 5‚Äì0 on aggregate. Despite a five-game unbeaten start to the 2015 season, the team eventually began to struggle in the standings, coupled with a loss to Sporting Kansas City in the semi-finals of the 2015 Open Cup. RSL also lost key player Nat Borchers, who they traded to the Portland Timbers before the season and all-time goalscorer √Ålvaro Sabor√≠o, traded away to D.C. United mid-season. Although late-season signings Luis Silva and Juan Manuel Martinez provided strong performances, the team did not qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2007. The 2016 season started with the Quarterfinals on the 2015‚Äì16 CONCACAF Champions League where they were eliminated by eventual runner up Tigres UANL of Liga MX by an aggregate score of 3‚Äì1. The 2016 season saw Real Salt Lake return to the playoffs but they were once again eliminated by the LA Galaxy, this time by a 3‚Äì1 score line on the road in the Western Conference play in game. In the off season, longtime legends Javier Morales and Jamison Olave did not have their options exercised by the club. On March 20, 2017 the club announced that head coach Jeff Cassar had been dismissed from his duties only three games into the season. Daryl Shore was named interim head coach for the two games against the New York Red Bulls and Minnesota United. On March 29 it was announced that Mike Petke would take over the head coaching position following the game against Minnesota United on April 1. Despite a dazzling late season run, the team finished one point shy of making the playoffs. The 2018 season was heralded with the opening of the new $78 million Training Center and Zion's Bank Real Academy in Herriman, Utah. The facility was praised for offering world-class training amenities year round for Real Salt Lake and the organization's other teams the NWSL's Utah Royals FC and the men's second division side Real Monarchs. It also houses the team's youth academy, which was moved from Casa Grande, Arizona, offering a single location and clear path for acquiring and developing young talent.

Biography  He was born as a member of one of the most important princely families of Georgia, the House of Orbeliani. His parents were Prince Mamuka Tomazovich Orbeliani and Princess Ketevan Eristavi of Ksani. His family originated from Georgia, then part of the Russian Empire. He was in the army since the 1860s. His first success was shown in the battles with the mountaineers and later he also took part in the Russian-Turkish war (1877‚Äì1878). As a lieutenant he fought in the Caucasus, by 1883 he was already a colonel and six years later a major-general. He was also the commander of the: * Caucasian Military District (1892‚Äì1895) * 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Caucasian Cossack Division (1895‚Äì1896) * Terek Cossack Division (1896‚Äì1897) * 2nd Brigade Terek Cossack (1897‚Äì1899) Orbeliani led Russian forces in the Russo-Japanese War. He was promoted to lieutenant general in January 1901 and took command of the 2nd Cossack Division. In 1905 he was acting commander of the 22nd and 18th Russian Army Corps. Due to illness Ivan Orbeliani retired from service in 1906 with the rank General of the cavalry.  Family and descendants  In Tiflis in 1872, he married his cousin Princess Maria Dmitrievna Svyatopolk-Mirsky (1856‚Äì1899), daughter of the Russian General Prince Dmitry Ivanovich Svyatopolk-Mirsky and his wife, Princess Sophia Yakovlevna Orbeliani (30 May 1825 ‚Äì 9 June 1898). They had three children: * Prince Mamuka Ivanovich of Orbeliani (1873 - 1924). In 1898, he married Princess Yelizaveta Iraklievna Bagration of Georgia (27 October 1870 - 25 November 1942), the daughter of Prince Irakli of Georgia (1826‚Äì1882) and Princess Tamar Chavchavadze (1852‚Äì1933). * Princess Sonia Ivanovna Orbeliani (1875, St.Petersburg (1915), Palace Tsarskoe Selo). She never married, but dedicated herself to the Russian court. She was one of the Maids-of-Honor of the \\"Imperial Bedchamber to Her Majesty\\", the highest rank for the hundreds of women who held the position at Court. She was a close friend of Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse). She died of a progressive spinal disease.http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/soniaorbeliani.html * Prince Dmitry Ivanovich Orbeliani (1875, Mir, Belarus - 1922, London). A personal assistant of the Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia. Dmitry married (1900 in St. Petersburg) Countess Vera von Kleinmichel (1877, St. Petersburg - 1948, Malta). They had an only daughter Princess Galena Dmitrievna Orbeliani (b. 5 May 1922), who was born soon after her father's death. Prince Ivan died in 1919 and was buried at the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta, Georgia.

After World War II, he testified at trials of the Nazis, and received special recognition from the State of Israel. Biography After his parents and other family members were killed in the ghetto in 1941, Joseph and his brother David were taken to Sobibor extermination camp. After one day in the camp, he fled with his brother to the nearest forest, and together with other survivors founded the core of a partisan group. During the war, the group was led by Jews who had escaped from nearby ghettos and from Sobibor. The group also included the postwar writer Dov Freiberg. \\"We continued forward and soon we saw a small house in front of us. Because of all the snow that had built up around it, it seemed very low in the ground. In front of it was a half-destroyed low awning, without doors, and half its roofing missing. ...The door opened and Jurziek was swallowed up inside. He sat there for ages, it seemed. At last, when our patience was exhausted, he reappeared with a broad smile on his face. ‚ÄúI've found us an excellent hiding place,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúthere are two women here with a small baby girl. They are very poor and they've nothing to eat. ... In order to counteract the rumours spreading through the area, about us, we decided to spread one of our own. It became known that a partisan headquarters was based in the house and anyone who said a word about it was endangering his own life and that of his family. But the rumours about us spread very quickly. Strange and different stories were heard about the house - there were those who had seen whole 'platoons' of partisans coming and going throughout the night, and around the house guards armed with machine-guns; there were those who had seen people get to close to the house and simply disappear. People became afraid to get too close, and those whose path perforce took them in the vicinity, made a wide detour, rather than tempt providence.\\" After the war, Joseph took part in locating the fleeing Nazi war criminals in Europe and served as a witness in the Nuremberg Trials. He joined communist forces in Poland under the Soviet military control (pictured). In 1950, Serchuk obtained a passport and went to Israel. Immediately upon arriving in Israel, he was drafted as a soldier to the Israeli army. After service, he married, settled in Yad Eliyahu in Tel Aviv, and opened a business. Serchuk travelled to Europe several times to testify in the trials of former Nazis including that of Oberscharf√ºhrer Hugo Raschendorfer. Raschendorfer admitted to participating in several mass executions in Nazi-occupied Che≈Çm, and was convicted of murdering an additional number of Jews on his own volition. After Raschendorfer was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, Serchuk was awarded a special award from the Nazi Crimes Investigation Department of the Israel Police. In 1967, Levi Eshkol, the Israeli Prime Minister, gave him the Fighters against Nazis Medal, and in 1968, Serchuk received in addition the State Fighters Medal. Serchuk saw the establishment and strengthening of the Israel Defense Forces and the State of Israel as retribution against the Nazis who slaughtered all of his extended family. Serchuk died in 1993 in Tel Aviv, at the age of 74. References  External links  * About Oberscharf√ºhrer Hugo Raschendorfer and his sentence Further reading   *Freiberg, Dov (2007).

The company delivers wood pellets in bulk and sells fully automated wood pellet boilers for hydronic heating.http://www.pressherald.com/archive/heating-with-wood-pellets-gets- otten-fired-up_2008-05-08.html MESys has been involved in numerous academic studies, work with political groups concerned with the environmental and economic aspects of residential and light commercial heating, and works with American regulatory bodies concerned with the safety of heating appliances. Viable alternative energy sources in Maine 80% of Maine residences are heated with fuel oil.U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10-7-2010 In 2008 during a period of extraordinarily high oil prices former Maine Governor John Baldacci formed The Governor's Wood to Energy Task Force in order to determine the viability of biomass, and wood pellets in particular, as a fuel source for heating in Maine. The Governor's Wood to Energy Task Force in 2008 published clear estimates by the Maine Forest Service that the forests of Maine are under-utilized and 5.8 million green tons per year could be sustainably harvested in Maine in addition to the 18.6 million tons per year currently harvested.http://www.maineenergysystems.com/userfiles/files/Wood%20to%20Energy%20Task%20Force%20Report.pdf The Maine Forest Service findings went on to report that an additional 3.8 million green tons per year could be harvested sustainably from New Hampshire and Massachusetts. If 10% of Maine's residences were converted to wood pellet fuel, it would require ~650,000 tons of green wood per year making large scale wood pellet heating a possibility in Maine. It is MESys's goal to make wood pellet fuel a primary heat source for a large number of residences in Maine. Calculations on the economic impact of foreign oil on the Maine economy made by Co-Director and economist Dr. William \\"Bill\\" Strauss have been published. Bill Strauss' work \\"How to Cure Maine‚Äôs Addiction to Heating Oil\\" suggests that too much money is leaving the region as a result of foreign heating oil and that keeping some or all of the heating fuel revenues in the region through the use of wood pellet fuel would remedy this drain on the economy. Work with regulatory agencies Much of Maine Energy Systems work to make wood pellet heating more prevalent in the Northeast has been with regulatory agencies. At the time MESys was founded very few regulations existed which directly referred to Wood Pellet boilers in Maine and the surrounding regions. As a result, rules and regulations created to regulate the installation and use of cordwood and coal stoker boilers were frequently applied to pellet boilers. Co-Owner Dr. Harry \\"Dutch\\" Dresser Jr. has been instrumental in helping to achieve parity in heating regulations between wood pellet heating appliances and conventional liquid and gaseous fuel appliances in some jurisdictions. Regulations which directly address wood pellet heat have existed for decades in various countries in Europe; the majority of new construction in Upper Austria is heated with wood pellet boilers.Egger et al., Biomass Heating in Upper Austria: Green Energy, Green Jobs. O.O. Energiesparverband, 2011 As wood pellet boilers gain use in the United States it is necessary that regulations be devised which directly address appropriate wood pellet boiler use. Currently the lack of wood pellet fuel based appliance regulations requires regulatory agencies to hold wood pellet boilers to standards established for a different solid fuel source, such as cordwood, even though the manually fed operation of a cordwood boiler bears no resemblance to the operation of an automatic wood pellet boiler.http://www.maineenergysystems.com/How_Pellet_Burning_Works.htm Regulatory changes that have been made to directly address wood pellet boilers through Maine Energy Systems involvement include the following: The Maine DEP has found that some wood pellet boilers are suitable for EPA Phase II certification based on conversion of European test results achieved under EN 303-5 test standards. Vermont DEC certification is nearing completion as well at the time of this writing (August 2011) on the same basis . Use of these test results is forward looking, as US agencies are frequently reluctant to use non-US test standards. The testing considered for these certifications focuses primarily on particulate emissions for boilers installed in unoccupied buildings. The boilers issued certification have particulate emissions values nearly ten times lower than the US EPA requirements.http://www.blt.bmlfuw.gv.at/pruefber/g2004153_E.pdf The Maine Fuels Board has spent nearly a year considering many of its solid fuel-related installation codes with the help of pellet boiler practitioners. The Board has recognized the actual attributes of modern pellet-fired boiler systems and is proposing modifications to its installation regulations http://www.maineenergysystems.com/userfiles/files/MaineFuelBoardRulemakingPkg.pdf that will bring virtual parity between the rules for automatic pellet fueled boilers and conventional liquid and gaseous fuel boilers. Work with academia The carbon neutrality of wood pellet fuel has been the focus of academic discussions recently. A study by the Manomet group proposed a model on the effects of biomass energy on atmospheric carbon levels. With this model a carbon debt occurs at the time of harvest and a carbon dividend occurs as new trees replace the harvested ones. This model describes wood pellet heat as a less than carbon neutral energy source. MESys co-director and economist Bill Strauss has written a rebuttal to this study which was published in the July 2011 edition of Biomass Power & Thermal Magazine, claiming that there are other methods of modeling biomass energy and that they were not well enough explored in the Manomet study. Strauss claims that the chosen Manomet model ignores the carbon dividend accumulated prior to harvest by the trees being harvested. MESys sponsored a Worcester Polytechnic Institute student Major Qualifying Project to find and design the best method for automated ash removal for a wood pellet boiler. The project used Axiomatic design as well as conventional design methods to fully explore the functions required of an ash removal system. Two systems were prototyped and tested; a screw conveyor system and a novel cyclonic separator and vacuum system. Globalism Maine Energy Systems' involvement in the transition to wood pellet heat has required the development of global relationships with European businesses that have successful experience in the wood pellet heat industry. This year Maine Energy Systems directors Dutch Dresser and Bill Strauss were keynote speakers at The 2011 World Sustainable Energy Days Conference in Wels, Upper Austria. MESys relations with Austrian business Tropper allowed the first fully pneumatic bulk pellet delivery truck in the United States to be built and used in Maine. Contractor training Since 2008 Maine Energy Systems has offered free training to properly licensed technicians who wish to install and service wood pellet boilers. Training currently focuses on the Austrian OkoFEN AutoPellet pellet boiler and the Auto-Pellet Air hot air furnace, although in the past contractors were trained on the Swedish Janfire NH wood pellet burner.

Probably born in Latin America, the concept spread broadly in the Spanish and French world during the 1990s. Now used frequently by independent publishers, authors and NGOs defending and promoting the cultural diversity, \\"Bibliodiversity\\" is also an academic journal. The day of 21 September was declared by independent publishers \\"the Bibliodiversity Day\\".  The concept ‚Äì origin and dissemination  Exactly who first coined the term bibliodiversidad remains unclear. Yet it seems beyond doubt that the word was used in Spanish first of all. Authorship has been claimed by a group of Chilean publishers who say they used it when founding the Editores independientes de Chile collective in the late 1990s. Publisher RIL Editores (www.rileditores.com) supposedly played a key role in coining the term. This claim to paternity has sometimes been disputed by Spanish publishers, however ‚Äì in particular by some members of the Madrid group \\"Bibliodiversidad\\", who claim the term as their own creation. To date neither of these two hypotheses has been supported by any printed documentation clearly authenticated by publication date. In 1999, the directors of ‚ÄúBiblioth√®que Interculturelle pour le Futur‚Äù ('intercultural library for the future') ‚Äì a programme established by the Charles L√©opold Mayer Foundation. and led by Michel Sauquet and √âtienne Galliand ‚Äì co-organised a meeting at Gij√≥n in Spain. This is when they encountered the term, in Spanish, for the first time. May 2002 saw the creation of the International Alliance of Independent Publishers, and the word was used by the organisation's founders. From this point onwards the International Alliance of Independent Publishers has made a major contribution to disseminating and promoting this term in various languages, especially at its international meetings (sources available for consultation: the Declarations from Dakar in 2003, Guadalajara in 2005 and Paris in 2007) and in all its communications. The publishers' alliance has helped the term become internationally accepted and to spread rapidly within the French-speaking world. The term bibliodiversity spreads in the English-speaking world.  Definition  Echoing the concept of biodiversity, \\"bibliodiversity\\" refers to the need for a variety of publications to be available to readers within a given environment. Fran√ßoise Benhamou, a French specialist of economics of the arts and literature, gave this explanation in her speech at the Assises Internationales de l'√âdition Ind√©pendante (International Assembly on Independent Publishing): \\"In biodiversity, variety refers very simply to the number of species; in the book world, this would be the number of titles. Yet it is clearly insufficient to leave matters there. I will return to this point later. The second factor highlighted by the concept of biodiversity is balance, the balance between the species. If we look at what that means in biodiversity we see the extremely simple idea that if you have several species but some are present in huge numbers while others are very scarce, the ones with many units are likely to eat or prevail over the others. This is what is happening in the book world where it is a matter for concern that the dominance of blockbusters on supermarket shelves and above all in bookstore displays is pushing out other offerings which are more difficult to promote\\". Today bibliodiversity is under threat from overproduction and from financial concentration in the publishing world, which favours the predominance of a few large publishing groups and the pursuit of large profit margins. Increasing emphasis on profitability exacerbates the temptation to reshape editorial policy accordingly. In order to guarantee margins acceptable to shareholders who may be very distant from the publishing house (both physically and culturally), production is recalibrated to enhance its commercial potential. In some cases the result is a huge imbalance, with commercial logic vastly prevailing over intellectual adventurousness: here, the publisher unreservedly espouses demand-based economics to the detriment of its role of stimulating and purveying new ideas (offering texts which may be challenging, original, non-standard). At the far extreme of the concept of biodiversity, therefore, we find what we might call the \\"bestsellerisation\\" of the publishing sphere. Given the increasing concentration of the publishing world, with its associated emphasis on profit and its trend towards bestsellerisation, independent publishers fulfil more than ever a role that has been abandoned in some cases by the ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù giants. This makes them the key players in bibliodiversity terms: they are genuine discoverers of talents, they are cultural risk-takers, they facilitate the existence and dissemination of the authors and texts of the future. This socially important role is clearly acknowledged by the major publishing groups ‚Äì who frequently cherry-pick for themselves those authors who begin to gain public recognition. Recognising the fundamental right to defend and promote their cultural sectors ‚Äì in the face of a generalised deregulation which might at times appear to be the WTO's desired aim ‚Äì in late 2005 UNESCO's member states signed the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. Concrete measures could now be taken to protect bibliodiversity ‚Äì cultural diversity in the book world.  Current challenges  While there seems to be some progress on the protection of \\"local\\" cultural production, with governments seeking to create an enabling environment for the development of their cultural industries and decision-makers potentially empowered to act, it is becoming a matter of urgency to achieve some way of assessing bibliodiversity via a set of indicators, via quantitative and qualitative data. Moreover, the digital revolution currently transforming the entire book world ‚Äì from the creation of texts through to their marketing ‚Äì could have significant impacts in terms of bibliodiversity. The dematerialisation of the book, the possibility of virtual communications with a much larger group of contacts / readers / buyers (via e-marketing, for example) might suggest that independent publishers and publishers in emerging markets have the potential to raise their profile. On the other hand, the capturing of this emerging marketplace (as yet unproven in economic terms) by new players ‚Äì online sales platforms, designers and manufacturers of IT equipment (readers in particular), etc. ‚Äì suggests that the publication production system will reconfigure without promoting greater bibliodiversity at the same time.  Use and promotion of the concept  Various international organisations such as UNESCO and the Latin Union, various cultural and publishing stakeholders such as the Association Internationale des Libraires Francophones (international association of French-speaking booksellers), the Alliance des √âditeurs Ind√©pendants (Alliance of Independent Publishers) and various national publisher associations (AEMI in Mexico, EDIN in Chile, EDINAR in Argentina, FIDARE in Italy, LIBRE in Brazil, etc.) are promoting and protecting bibliodiversity through symposia, meetingsGuadalajara (2005) and Paris (2007), sponsored by UNESCO and declarations.Dakar Declaration (2003), Guadalajara Declaration (2005) and Paris Declaration (2007) A reference work on bibliodiversity was published in 2006. In 2006, following a letter addressed to the candidates in the French presidential election, the newspaper Le Monde picked up several of the concrete measures proposed to promote bibliodiversity. Some Spanish-speaking publishers from Latin America launched in 2010 \\"El Dia B\\" (\\"the Bibliodiversity Day\\", 21 September). The European Writers' Parliament issued in November 2010 the Istambul Declaration, in which the bibliodiversity is mentioned: \\"Policies should be generated to prevent the standardization of expression and promote bibliodiversity\\". The first issue of an international journal entitled \\"Bibliodiversity\\", co-published by the International Alliance of Independent Publishers and by Double Ponctuation (www.double- communication.com) appeared in January 2011 (see www.bibliodiversity.org).  Quotations  Fran√ßoise Rivi√®re, Assistant Director-General for Culture at UNESCO, in her speech opening the Assises Internationales de l'√âdition Ind√©pendante (International Assembly on Independent Publishing ‚Äì Paris, July 2007): \\"Just as it seeks to highlight the complementary nature of the aims of biodiversity and cultural diversity on the global scene, UNESCO is also closely monitoring the issue of diversity of expression and content in the international book market. In other words, it is paying very close attention to what some people call \\"bibliodiversity\\" ‚Äì a word that has become widely adopted and is beginning to enter common usage\\". S√©gol√®ne Royal, President of the Poitou Charentes Regional Council, 28 January 2008: \\"This bibliodiversity we are defending ‚Äì a bibliodiversity accessible to all, open to all ‚Äì underpins equal opportunities for education and access to knowledge\\". The Jussieu Call for Open Science and Bibliodiversity, 10 October 2017: \\"We find it necessary to foster an Open Access model that is not restricted to a single approach based on the transfer of subscriptions towards APCs (publication fees charged to authors to allow free access to their articles). Such an approach would hamper innovation and otherwise would slow if not check the advent of bibliodiversity....Open Access must be complemented by support for the diversity of those acting in scientific publishing ‚Äì what we call bibliodiversity ‚Äì putting an end to the dominance of a small number among us imposing their terms to scientific communities.\\"  Notes and references   See also   Related articles (in French)  *Livre √©quitable (Fairtrade books) *√âditeurs ind√©pendants (independent publishers) *Bibliodiversit√© (in French) * <ÿ™ŸÜŸàÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿπÿ®Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ´ŸÇÿßŸÅŸä ŸÅŸä ÿπÿßŸÑŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®> (Article in Arabic)  Links and external documents  *Trois Espaces Linguistiques: Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (organisation of French-speaking countries), *Latin Union, CPLP (Community of Portuguese Language Countries), Organisation of Ibero-American States[(article on independent publishers in the Latin world; French only)] *International Alliance of Independent Publishers *Website of the international journal ‚ÄúBibliodiversity‚Äù *El D√≠a de la Bibliodiversidad, \\"El D√≠a B\\" *The European Writers' Parliament, Declaration of Istambul 2010 Category:Publishing ","title":"Bibliodiversity"},{"id":"32485450","text":"Enrico Bondi (born 5 October 1934 in Arezzo) is an Italian administrator.

History  For ' , the autograph score survives. Bach himself noted on its title: \\".\\" (' ‚Äì Motet for two choirs for the funeral for the blessed Rector, Professor Ernesti, by J. S. Bach). Ernesti was professor of poetry at Leipzig University and director of the Thomasschule. The first performance took place in the Paulinerkirche, the university church). Scholars debate if the performance was 24 October, or rather 21 October, as indicated by the title page of the sermon. Bach wrote a number of works for occasions of Leipzig University. Twelve such works survive: they are mainly festive in character (in German they have been categorised as Festmusiken zu Leipziger Universit√§tsfeiern). As well as being part of a series of works connected with the university, Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf as a funeral motet is one of a series of Bach motets.  Text  The text is taken from the Epistle to the Romans () and Martin Luther's third stanza to the hymn \\"\\" (1524). Ernesti himself had chosen the text from the epistle for the funeral sermon.  Scoring and structure  The motet is structured in three movements and scored for two four-part choirs. They sing together in movements 2 and 3. The orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings, choir II by reeds (two oboes, taille and bassoon). For the basso continuo, separate violone and organ parts are provided. # '''' # '''' # ''''  Music  Bach composed the text according to its meaning, not as music for mourning. The opening contrasts two choirs in imitation. In lively 3/8 time, the word \\"\\" (Spirit) is illustrated by a lively melismatic figure. The following idea, \\"\\" (but the Spirit itself intercedes for), is given as a fugue, first with independent entrances of all eight parts, but concentrated to four parts in the end, \\"\\" (with unutterable sighs). The sighs are audible in the broken melodic lines of all voices. The thought \\"\\" (He, however, who examines hearts) appears as a double fugue in four parts in . Here the word \\"\\" (saints) is illustrated in extended melismatic writing. The closing Pentecostal chorale is set for four parts.

Life  Gramann was born in Neustadt an der Aisch, Middle Franconia. He worked as rector of the Thomasschule in Leipzig. Poliander was Johann Eck's secretary at the 1519 Leipzig Debate, where he met Martin Luther and joined the Protestant Reformation. Poliander became pastor of Altstadt Church in 1525 in K√∂nigsberg (Kaliningrad), capital of the new Duchy of Prussia (a fief of the Crown of Poland), succeeding the fiery Johannes Amandus. The humanist was well-regarded by his peers, including the Catholic Johannes Dantiscus. He wrote secular and religious poetry in German and Latin. He was a strong advocate with Albert, Duke of Prussia, for the creation of the University of K√∂nigsberg. He donated his personal collection of 1,000 books to Altstadt's council; this became the foundation of the later K√∂nigsberg Public Library. He died in K√∂nigsberg.

Born on 19 June 1881 at Forst (Lausitz), Brade studied architecture at G√∂rlitz in Silesia, but became increasingly interested in botany. After working for several years in Germany as an architect and construction engineer, he accepted an invitation to join his brother Alfred, who lived in San Jose, Costa Rica, and owned a horticultural business in Europe. Arriving at Puerto Limon in January 1908, Brade embarked on plant hunting expeditions along the Atlantic coast. Over the next two and a half years, he collected about 500 plant species, however much of his collection was to be destroyed in the bombing of the Berlin-Dahlem Museum in World War II before it was classified. Not wishing to return to Germany and its cold winters, Brade joined another relative in Brazil in 1910, where he again worked in construction, botanizing in his spare time. After an unsuccessful venture into farming, he accepted a post with the National Museum. Brade later moved to the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, where he rose to Acting Superintendent in 1934, ultimately becoming Head of the Department of Systemic Botany. Retiring in 1952, Brade returned to S√£o Paulo, where he built a home and dedicated himself to the classification of the ferns and Melastomataceae he had collected. He wrote 86 papers published in various scientific journals, and in 1958 was awarded the Gold Medal of Merit 'D. Jo√£o VI' on the 150th anniversary of the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro.Pabst, G.

The name had been used for a district of the Cisalpine Republic. Its name, in typical Napoleonic fashion of naming departments after geographic features, derived from the river Adige (Etsch in german) which flowed through it. Neither the Cisalpine district nor the department of the Kingdom of Italy correspond precisely to the modern Italian province of Alto Adige (known as South Tyrol in English), although there is some geographical overlap.  History  Cisalpine Republic Under the Cisalpine Republic a district of Alto Adige (Distretto dell'Alto Adige) was created as a part of the short-lived \\"Department of Benaco\\". The District of Alto Adige included some municipalities of today's province of Verona. The Department of Benaco, which was created in 1797, was disbanded in 1798 and with it the District of Alto Adige after a structural reorganization of the Napoleon's Italian republic. Kingdom of Italy After the partition of the County of Tyrol between Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy on 9 June 1810 by Napoleon Bonaparte, the new department of Alto Adige was created.

Its capital was Trent and the administrative language Italian, but the German-speaking areas temporarily adopted bilingualism in the public notices and used German in city government. The department was known in German as \\"Ober-Etsch\\". The department included the area around BolzanoHistory of Bolzano, that had a population mostly romance speaking (Italians and Ladins) while the other areas of the former South Tyrol were left united to Bavaria because mostly German speaking. The department was disbanded after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. Its territory was divided over the actual Italian autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano/Bozen (also known as South Tyrol in English or Alto Adige in Italian). 300px  Reuse of name  The name Alto Adige had no historical antecedent about the region it denoted, but merely described the geographic area of the upper reaches of the Adige river. This was something that was commonly done during the Napoleonic period when naming departments, ignoring any historical names or connotations but using geographical references. The name was dropped after the end of the Napoleonic period, but was used by the Italian irredentists in the mid 1800s. The term \\"Alto Adige\\" was later used as the Italian name of the province of Bolzano by the fascist Ettore Tolomei in his Italianization campaign. He used the words \\"Alto Adige\\" as a historical connection to the Napoleon's geopolitical transformation of the Italian peninsula.Alto Adige under Napoleon In 1918 what was used to be officially called \\"southern Tyrol\\" was united after the end of World War I to Italy; but the term \\"Alto Adige\\" was applied instead of the Austrian-proposed \\"Italian Tyrol\\" (Tirolo Italiano) or \\"Tridentine Tyrol\\" (Tirolo tridentino). \\"Alto Adige\\" was made official by the fascist regime in 1923.

Icthyol. Explorer. Freshwaters, vol. 15, No. 4, pp. 351-368. Dec. 2004. This species is very susceptible to environmental changes including flow regimes, siltation in nesting sites, and poor environmental quality. The Noturus catfish reproduces from February to September and females reach sexual maturity in only one year.Bakar, J. A. and Heins, D. C.(1994), Reproductive life history of the North American nadtom catfish, Noturus hildebrandi (Bailey and Taylor 1950), with a review of data for the genus. Ecology of Freshwater Fish, 3: 167-175. Current management strategies for this recently discovered species haven't been completely developed yet, but could be comparative to the management of other madtom species. Siltation in the southern portions of the rivers, inhabited by Noturus gladiator that comes from the northern aspects of the waterways is causing stress on the reproductive success due to nest suffocation. There are records as close as twenty years ago showing the species inhabiting multiple other rivers around the areas it currently inhabits. This could be a sign that the species is in a decline. There should be population surveys done on the existing habitat and water quality surveys done in the inhabited areas as well as the uninhabited neighboring areas to see what the limiting pollutant might be in the water causing habitats to shrink. The area that this species inhabits needs to be managed in a way that could see a resurgence in gladiators numbers.

To the north it occupies the Hatchie River, Obion River, and Wolf River. The species is believed to have inhabited a broader range at one time, but due to siltation from river based transport, construction, and farming. Gladiator occurred in the Loosahatchie River, but has not been found since 1954. It is thought to have once occupied the Forked Deer drainage, but no longer after channelization of this system. Most of the remaining populations have been pushed to sites of the rivers with lower human densities and clearer flowing water.

Environmental cleanliness is a major factor to determine if a habitat is suitable or not. Areas that consistently contain silt or have soft muddy bottoms are not proffered by the species. The preferred stream width is form 4-15m wide, at a temperature of 20-26 degrees Celsius, is 15‚Äì50 cm deep, and has a dissolved oxygen level from 4.6-8.5ppm.

Form Fishbase. http://www.fishbase.us/summary/Noturus-gladiator.html Sexual maturity is reached in the second summer, and the average life span is three years. N. gladiator's diet consists mainly of aquatic insects such as mayflies, caddis flies, stoneflies, and occasionally small fish when size allows. These insects usually only occur in healthy clean streams, which human activity has limited the amount of suitable streams for these prey items. Like all catfish they have pectoral and dorsal spines which ward off predators. These spines are one of the four different variations of spines in noturus catfish.Egge, J. J. D. and Simons, A.

Version 23 May 2007 (under construction). http://tolweb.org/Noturus_gladiator/69870/2007.05.23 in The Tree of Life Web Project, http://tolweb.org/ Life history The spawning period is during the summer months, starting in June and running through August. The clutch sizes consist of anywhere from reported seventy to one-hundred oocytes. Dry mass, clutch size, and clutch volume, has been found to be directly correlated to female size. The males guard the nests and do not retreat when disturbed. Males stay on the nest after the young hatch and until they are free swimming. The most common nest sites are under rocks or in discarded cans or jugs. Males that do not have a nest to guard still will find a nest site and guard it until the mating season is over. Growth is rapid over N. gladiators lifespan. After the first three months of life N. Gladiator will be 35-40mm, and after the first year, 45-50mm. Sexually mature adults are between 40mm to well over 100mm. Their egg size is relatively large compared to their body size, and the intensive parental care given to the young helps maintain the species‚Äô populations.

Population studies since have been done and revealed that N. Gladiator is sporadic but not as rare as once thought. Due to human related activities the success of the species has dwindled from recent historical reports. N. Gladiator is a new species, but was once thought to be a sub-species of another Noturus. This former group was thought to be one of the most richly populated species of Noturus in America. Poor agricultural practices and river reconstruction are the main causes of the diminishing populations. The lower Hatchie River was channelized for agricultural purposes and has taken out all of the cover N. gladiator could have used to feed and reproduce. Before this channelization, the lower portion was also uninhabitable for N. gladiator because of extreme siltation due to erosion from agriculture. The remaining populations of N. Gladiator are sustaining themselves in the stretches of untainted habitat in the upper portions of their river ranges. As long as these areas remain undisturbed from siltation and cover loss N. gladiator should not decline any more.

It was named after the humanist Johannes Reuchlin (1455‚Äì1522).  History  The history of Reuchlin-Gymnasium dates back over 500 years. In 1447 a Latin school of Pforzheim was named as predecessor school for the first time, whose founding date is unknown. It probably owes its origins to the institution of a collegiate at castle church St. Michael. Members of the collegiate were most probably teachers as the five year old Johannes Reuchlin entered the school. Reuchlin was taught there for ten years. In the two last decades of the 15th century the Latin school in Pforzheim became more important as it surpassed the Latin schools of Baden-Baden and Ettlingen. The Latin school in Pforzheim had competent teachers, and great men praised themselves to have received their first education at this school. Around 1500 under rector Georg Simmler the school turned from the collegiate school to an urban school. The heyday of the school lasted half a century, but with the death of Reuchlin the prominence of the school in Pforzheim gradually decreased. 1692 the monastery in which the Latin school was placed was destroyed in a great city fire. The Latin school wasn't continued until 1718 as Collegium Reuchlianum in the sacristy extension of the castle church. As an answer to the great growth of the town in the end of the 19th century new school buildings were constructed. In this time the grammar school was built as a successor to the Latin school on the bridge to Goethestra√üe into which it was moved in 1905. It was a stately renaissance building. The highlight was, that the new school would bear the name \\"Reuchlin-Gymnasium\\". The riverside road on the Enz at the Reuchlin-Gymnasium received the name \\"Simmlerstra√üe\\" in memory of the first known rector of the Latin school. Eleven years later the High Secondary School, now named Hebel-Gymnasium, moved into its new house. The destruction of Pforzheim on 23 February 1945 ruined the Reuchlin-Gymnasium building stock so severely that it couldn't be rebuilt. Unlike the Reuchlin, the High Secondary School (Hebel-Gymnasium) was rebuilt and accommodated the Reuchlin- Gymnasium and the girls' secondary school in its rooms. For twenty years (1948‚Äì1968) the Reuchlin-Gymnasium was a guest at the Hebel-Gymnasium. 1955 the Reuchlin-Gymnasium received its organisational independence back again on the occasion of the humanist Johannes Reuchlin's 500th birthday. The Reuchlin- Gymnasium couldn't move into the own house on the old water tower until 25 October 1968. The Reuchlin-Gymnasium is located far away from the loud town traffic. Nonetheless it is still near the city centre and with the city bus line 7 and direct school bus it is linked with the central station, and all town districts are easily reachable. The four buildings are amid green areas and schoolyards, the main building with the class room section and an atrium as the meeting place for communication and celebration, the music pavilion, the scientific building with the sports hall, since 1970 the extra building and since 1999 the Greek Theatre. Currently about 900 students visit the Reuchlin-Gymnasium.  Education  After entering the school, the Reuchlin- Gymnasium offers an old language and a new language orientation, plus a bilingual one. The school is especially known for its Highly gifted orientation. In the old language orientation, Latin is taught four hours per week from the 5th class onwards. In the new language orientation, the second foreign language is French taught from the 6th class onwards. The bilingual orientation offers intensified English lessons (six weekly lessons instead of four in class 5, and four instead of three in class 6) and also from class 6 onwards French. In class 8 every student has the choice between Ancient Greek and Naturwissenschaft und Technik (English Science and technical education). Students of all forms, who haven't chosen French for class 6, can choose it now. The highly gifted orientation, which the school has had since 2006, teaches Latin from class 5 onwards and is taught by extra skilled teachers. For entering the highly gifted orientation a student has to pass a test and some practice lessons. Also every student can earn the certificate \\"Europ√§isches Gymnasium\\" (English European grammar school), if he chooses Spanish as a 4th foreign language, thus studying two old languages (Latin and Greek) and two modern languages (English and Spain). If chosen, the English lessons are reduced to two weekly lessons.  Events  * Adventsrock (Advent Rock): Every year in the atrium of the Reuchlin-Gymnasium on the first Friday of December the Adventsrock takes place.

Nevertheless, the relationship between induced abortion and mental health is an area of political controversy. In 2008, the American Psychological Association concluded after a review of available evidence that induced abortion did not increase the risk of mental-health problems. In 2011, the U.K. National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health similarly concluded that first-time abortion in the first trimester does not increase the risk of mental-health problems compared with bringing the pregnancy to term. In 2018, The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that abortion does not lead to depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder. The U.K. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists likewise summarized the evidence by finding that abortion did not increase the risk of mental-health problems compared to women carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term. Two studies conducted on the Danish population in 2011 and 2012 analysed the association between abortion and psychiatric admission found no increase in admissions after an abortion. The same study, in fact, found an increase in psychiatric admission after first child-birth. A 2008 systematic review of the medical literature on abortion and mental health found that high-quality studies consistently showed few or no mental-health consequences of abortion, while poor-quality studies were more likely to report negative consequences. Despite the weight of scientific and medical opinion, some anti-abortion advocacy groups have continued to allege a link between abortion and mental- health problems. Some anti-abortion groups have used the term \\"post-abortion syndrome\\" to refer to negative psychological effects which they attribute to abortion. However, \\"post-abortion syndrome\\" is not recognized as an actual syndrome by the mainstream medical community. Post-abortion syndrome (PAS) is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM- IV-TRAmerican Psychiatric Association (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition: DSM-IV-TR. American Psychiatric Pub. . or in the ICD-10 list of psychiatric conditions. Medical professionals and pro-choice advocates have argued that the effort to popularize the idea of a \\"post-abortion syndrome\\" is a tactic used by anti-abortion advocates for political purposes. \\"Currently, there are active attempts to convince the public and women considering abortion that abortion frequently has negative psychiatric consequences. This assertion is not borne out by the literature: the vast majority of women tolerate abortion without psychiatric sequelae.\\" Some U.S. state legislatures have mandated that patients be told that abortion increases their risk of depression and suicide, despite the scientific evidence contradicting such claims.  Current scientific evidence  Systematic reviews of the scientific literature have concluded that there are no differences in the long-term mental health of women who obtain induced abortions as compared to women in appropriate control groups‚Äîthat is, those who carry unplanned pregnancies to term. While some studies have reported a statistical correlation between abortion and mental health problems, these studies are typically methodologically flawed and fail to account for confounding factors, or, as with results of women having multiple abortions, yield results inconsistent with other similar studies. Higher-quality studies have consistently found no causal relationship between abortion and mental- health problems. The correlations observed in some studies may be explained by pre-existing social circumstances and emotional or mental health problems. Various factors, such as emotional attachment to the pregnancy, lack of support, and conservative views on abortion may increase the likelihood of experiencing negative reactions. Major medical and psychiatric expert groups have consistently found that abortion does not cause mental-health problems. In 2008, the American Psychological Association reviewed the literature on abortion and mental health and concluded that the risk of mental health problems following a single, first-trimester induced abortion of an adult women is no greater than carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term. While observing that abortion may both relieve stress and \\"engender additional stress,\\" they explicitly rejected the idea that abortion is \\"inherently traumatic.\\" Among those women who do experience mental health issues following an abortion, the APA concluded that these issues are most likely related to pre-existing risk factors. Since these and other risk factors may also predispose some women to more negative reactions following a birth, the higher rates of mental illness observed among women with a prior history of abortion are more likely to be caused by these other factors than by abortion itself. The panel noted severe inconsistency between the outcomes reported by studies on the effect of multiple abortions. Additionally, the same factors which predispose a woman to multiple unwanted pregnancies may also predispose her to mental health difficulties. Therefore, they declined to draw a firm conclusion on studies concerning multiple abortions. In December 2011, the U.K. Royal College of Psychiatrists undertook a systematic review to clarify the question of whether abortion had harmful effects on women's mental health. The review, conducted by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health and funded by the U.K. Department of Health, concluded that while unwanted pregnancy may increase the risk of mental-health problems, women faced with unwanted pregnancies have similar rates of mental-health problems whether they choose to carry the pregnancy to term or to have an abortion. Some women do experience negative emotions after an abortion, but not at rates different from women who wanted an abortion and did not have one or from women who have miscarriages. Women having abortions may receive support from abortion providers or national call centers like Exhale or All-Options. Post-abortion syndrome The idea that abortion has negative psychological effects was widely promoted by crisis pregnancy centers in the 1970s and the term \\"post- abortion syndrome\\" has widely been used by anti-abortion advocates to broadly include any negative emotional reactions attributed to abortion. Post-abortion syndrome has not been validated as a discrete psychiatric condition and is not recognized by the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, nor the American Public Health Association. The Guttmacher Institute reports that as of August 2018, of the 22 U.S. states that include information on possible psychological responses to abortion, eight states stress negative emotional responses. Recent literature that has addressed the psychological impacts of abortion have emphasized a need to study women who have a predisposition to mental health risk before having an abortion.  Legal and political history  Under the 1967 Abortion Act, abortion in the United Kingdom was legalized only when two doctors agreed that carrying the pregnancy to term would be detrimental to a woman's physical or mental health. Consideration of mental health also played a role in the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade which ruled that state governments may not prohibit late terminations of pregnancy when \\"necessary to preserve the [woman's] life or health\\". This rule was clarified by the 1973 judicial decision Doe v. Bolton, which specifies \\"that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors‚Äîphysical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age‚Äîrelevant to the well-being of the patient.\\" It is by this provision that women in the US can legally choose abortion when screenings reveal abnormalities of a viable fetus. In 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan directed U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, an evangelical Christian and abortion opponent, to issue a report on the health effects of abortion. Reportedly, the idea for the review was conceived as a political gambit by Reagan advisors Dinesh D'Souza and Gary Bauer, who believed that such a report would \\"rejuvenate\\" the anti-abortion movement by producing evidence of the risks of abortion. Koop was reluctant to accept the assignment, believing that Reagan was more concerned with appeasing his political base than with improving women's health. Ultimately, Koop reviewed over 250 studies pertaining to the psychological impact of abortion. In January 1989 Koop wrote in a letter to Reagan that \\"scientific studies do not provide conclusive data about the health effects of abortion on women.\\" Koop acknowledged the political context of the question in his letter, writing: \\"In the minds of some of [Reagan's advisors], it was a foregone conclusion that the negative health effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming that the evidence would force the reversal of Roe vs. Wade.\\" In later testimony before the United States Congress, Koop stated that the quality of existing evidence was too poor to prepare a report \\"that could withstand scientific and statistical scrutiny.\\" Koop noted that \\"... there is no doubt about the fact that some people have severe psychological effects after abortion, but anecdotes do not make good scientific material.\\" In his congressional testimony, Koop stated that while psychological responses to abortion may be \\"overwhelming\\" in individual cases, the psychological risks of abortion were \\"minuscule from a public health perspective.\\" Subsequently, a Congressional committee charged that Koop refused to publish the results of his review because he failed to find evidence that abortion was harmful, and that Koop watered down his findings in his letter to Reagan by claiming that the studies were inconclusive. Congressman Theodore S. Weiss (D-NY), who oversaw the investigation, argued that when Koop found no evidence that abortion was harmful, he \\"decided not to issue a report, but instead to write a letter to the president which would be sufficiently vague as to avoid supporting the pro-choice position that abortion is safe for women.\\" Later in 1989, responding to the political debate over the question, the American Psychological Association (APA) undertook a review of the scientific literature. Their review, published in the journal Science, concluding that \\"the weight of the evidence from scientific studies indicates that legal abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in the first trimester does not pose a psychological hazard for most women.\\" The APA task force also concluded that \\"severe negative reactions after abortions are rare and can best be understood in the framework of coping with normal life stress.\\" In 1994, the U.K.'s House of Lord's Commission of Inquiry into the Operation and Consequences of The Abortion Act published a report (commonly referred to as the Rawlinson Report) which concluded that there was no scientific evidence that abortion provided any mental health benefits but instead may put women at risk for psychiatric illness greater than if woman carried to term. The Commission recommended that abortion providers \\"should initiate independent and long-term follow up of those clients considered to be most at risk of emotional distress.\\" In a press release, the Rawlinson commission stated that the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) had provided written testimony stating that there are \\"no psychiatric indications for abortion,\\" noting that this \\"raises serious questions given that 91% of abortion are carried out on the grounds of the mental health of the mother.\\" In response, the RCP issued a statement that the Rawlinson commissions summary of their written statement was \\"an inaccurate portrayal of the College's views on abortion,\\" adding that \\"There is no evidence of increase risk of major psychiatric disorder or of long lasting psychological distress [following abortion]. In 2006, the U.K.'s House of Commons Science and Technology Committee undertook another inquiry into scientific developments and included a request for the RCP to update their 1994 statement on abortion in light of more recent studies. In 2008, the RCP did update their position statement to recommend that women should be screened for risk factors that may be associated with subsequent development of mental health problems and should counselled about the possible mental health risks of abortion. The revised RCP position statement included a recommendation for a systematic review of abortion and mental health with special consideration of \\"whether there is evidence for psychiatric indications for abortion.\\" This modified opinion was influenced by a growing body of literature showing a link between abortion and mental health problems, including a 30-year longitudinal study of about 500 women born in Christchurch New Zealand and a Cornwall inquest into the abortion related suicide of a well known British artist, Emma Beck. This recommendation resulted in the 2011 review conducted by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health.

Its native range stretches from the Obion River in Kentucky to the Homochitto River in Mississippi.  Description  The least madtom is a small slender- bodied fish with a flat head. It measures up to 6.9 centimeters in length. The adipose fin is either clear or white; however, populations in Mississippi sometimes have a dark patch on the adipose fin. Body coloration varies by geography. There are two known subspecies, Noturus h. hildebrandi and Noturus h. lautus. N. h. hildebrandi, which inhabits the Homochitto River and Bayou Pierre, has a long head and a mottled coloration. N.h. lautus lives in the Obion and surrounding rivers; this subspecies has a shorter head and four light-colored oval areas on a red-brown to black back. Males and females are identical in appearance. Most live about 12 to 15 months, dying shortly after reproducing.  Habitat  The least madtom inhabits sandy riffles, mixed rock riffles, creeks, pools, and small rivers. It is commonly found in shallow areas containing submerged logs, sticks, leaves, and other debris.  Reproduction  The least madtom's spawning season lasts from June through August. During this time the males increase in size. The females spawn during their second summer. To prepare for spawning, adults take shelter, either singly or in pairs, under stones, shells, or in debris. An average of 19 orange oocytes are laid in these areas. Both parents guard the nest as the eggs develop. Eggs hatch within 8 to 9 days. Yolk resorption takes about 9 to 10 days after hatching.  Diet  The least madtom's diet consists of 16 different invertebrate taxa. Midges make up the majority of their diet, followed by caddisfly larva. Crustaceans are consumed only in late winter and early spring. The size of prey is proportional to body size.

New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2011. 181. The species' average length is between ; however, the longest ever recorded specimen was . Distribution The speckled madtom has a wide range throughout the southeastern United States. The species is found in abundance throughout Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee.Speckled Madtom. Florida Museum of Natural History, n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2013. . In Tennessee it is found only in the Conasauga River system, where it is abundant.Etnier, David A., and Wayne C. Starnes., The Fishes of Tennessee. Knoxville, Tennessee: The University of Tennessee Press, 2001. 321-22. Web. 20 Nov. 2013. It is also found in Atlantic and Gulf slope drainages from the Edisto River in South Carolina to the Amite- Comite River system of Louisiana. The St. Johns River system in the Florida peninsula makes up the southernmost area of their range.Noturus leptacanthus. Encyclopedia of Life, n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2013. . Ecology The speckled madtom inhabits small to moderate-sized streams. They often inhabit very shallow riffles with sand, rock or gravel bottoms. During the day speckled madtoms will rest in areas with aquatic vegetation such as pondweed or burweed.Ross, Stephen T., Inland Fishes of Mississippi. Jackson, Mississippi: Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, 2001. 323-24. Web. 20 Nov. 2013. However, due to their nocturnal feeding patterns, they will leave these areas at night to go feed. Feeding begins at dusk and the amount of food in their stomach will increase until dawn when the feeding stops. Their diet is mostly insect larvae, especially midge larvae. They detect their food with their sensory barbels, and their vision plays little part in their feeding behavior. Major competition for the speckled madtom comes from other species from the genus Noturus. The only known predators of the speckled madtom are the rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) and larger Noturus species.Clark, Kathleen E., Ecology and Life History of the Speckled Madtom, Noturus leptacanthus [Ictaluridae]. 1978 In order to protect themselves from predation, all Noturus species have developed a venomous sting from their pectoral spines; however, the speckled madtom has a relatively low level of toxicity.Reed, Hugh D., The Poison Glands of Notorus and Schilbeodes. The American Naturalist 41(1907): 553-566. Life history The spawning period for the speckled madtom is from May through August with water temperatures ranging from . The speckled madtom is one of the least fecund species of freshwater North American fishes. They normally spawn two clutches per year with each clutch consisting of 14-45 eggs. Their eggs are very large relative to their body size, with the average size being in diameter. It is believed that the large egg size compensates for the extremely small clutch size. The large egg size allows for the larvae to be very large and well developed upon hatching. The average size of a one-year-old is , and the average size of a 2-year-old is . They reach sexual maturity by their second summer and have a maximum lifespan of 2.5‚Äì3 years. The speckled madtom is known to nest inside of discarded cans and bottles that are cleared of debris and silt by the male. The male then guards the eggs without feeding for around 2.5 weeks. Conservation The population of this species is steady throughout its range and shows no signs of major decline. No widespread threats to the species are known. One study showed that the speckled madtom is more abundant in areas with agricultural land use, though agriculture has been known to hurt many species because of runoff.Walser, C A., H. L. Bart., Influence of Agriculture on In-Stream Habitat and Fish Community Structure in Piedmont Watersheds of the Chattahoochee River System.

This species is endangered in Missouri, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Michigan and is federally listed as threatened. Ecology According to a 1982 study by Burr, the quantitative diet of the brindled madtom was determined via dissection of stomach contents which \\"[‚Ä¶] contained mostly dipteran larvae and pupae, ephemeropteran naiads, trichopteran larvae and adult isopods, [‚Ä¶], chironomids and simuliids were most frequently eaten. Ephemeropteran larvae, including the genera Potamanthus and Stenonema, were second in frequency, and trichopteran larvae, primarily the genus Chematopsyche, were third in frequency. Among crustacea, Lirceus and a variety of copepods were next in importance in the diet. Worms, other microcrustaceans, other aquatic insects and fish and plant material made only small contributions to the total diet,\\".Burr, Brooks M., Mayden, Richard L., \\"Life History of the Brindled Madtom Noturus miurus in Mill Creek, Illinois (Pisces: Ictaluridae).\\" American Midland Naturalist 107 1 (1982): 25-41. Predation upon adult brindled madtoms is primarily from upper trophic level aquatic predators such as the longnose gar. Brindled madtom egg clutches are a viable food source for multiple opportunistic species including crustaceans, insects, and other fishes. Although most other Noturus species occur primarily in riffles, the brindled madtom occurs primarily in moderately silted pools with heavy texture and mild currents. The brindled madtom thrives in clean, benthic regions of pools in swift streams and rivers that have moderate siltation over a cobble or heavily textured bottom.Turner, Thomas F., Robison, Henry W., \\"Genetic Diversity of the Caddo Madtom, Noturus Taylori, with Comments on Factors That Promote Genetic Divergence in Fishes Endemic to the Ouachita Highlands.\\" The Southwestern Naturalist 51 (2006): 338-345 The species thrives in water with consistent temperatures around .Coker, G.A., Portt, C.B., Minns, C.K. \\"Morthological and Ecological Characteristics of Canadian Freshwater Fishes.\\" Canadian Manuscript Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 2554 (2001).

Life history It takes one year for females and two years for males to mature sexually and nesting/reproduction extends from May to July, with regional variance according to water temperature. When reproduction begins, the mating pair guards their clutch of 50-100 eggs, which is usually deposited in a protective shelter with a very small opening such as under rocks or in bottles/cans that litter the waterways; and these shelters are layered with mud or silt by the parents. The brindled madtom can produce multiple clutches per year and the average lifespan of the species is about 3 years, with most specimens being found in the 2 year old range. The selective nature of this species as it relates to reproduction habitat puts the reproductive fitness of the species as a whole, in jeopardy. Since this species prefers a substrate which has equal stone, cobble, sediment and texture which provides shelter and preferred nesting opportunities, even the slightest disturbance can drastically alter and distort the balance needed for fitness. The decrease in preferred habitat has contributed to the decline of various species of madtoms, leading to an inter-species breeding, specifically between the brindled madtom and the tadpole madtom,Menzel, Bruce W., Raney, Edward C., \\"Hybrid Madtom Catfish, Noturus gyrinus x Noturus miurus, from Cayuga Lake, New York.\\" American Midland Naturalist 90 (1973)165-176. which may lead to further chromosomal evolution within this species as identified by LeGrand's study.LeGrande, William H., \\"Chromosomal Evolution in North American Catfishes (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae) with Particular Emphasis on the Madtoms, Noturus.\\" Copeia 1 (1981): 33-52.

Its spawning season occurs from spring to early summer in riffle areas, and sexual maturation occurs after two years.  Geographic distribution  The freckled madtom is a freshwater species found across the eastern United States; it is common across most of its range.

Freckled madtoms are often misidentified as bullheads or other catfish. Further, the freckled madtom is said to be an intolerant species that sometimes disappears after a disturbance. These individuals are fluvial specialists, meaning they are specialized to a particular habitat, theirs being fast-moving riffle habitats. Human litter may be a potential disturbance to the species; young and breeding adult male individuals have often been found in beverage cans and other human- created debris. It may be difficult to determine range expansion, though, because of its small population sizes in certain areas, including central Oklahoma.Orth, D.J. and Jones, R.N. \\"Range Extensions of the Orangethroat Darter (Etheostoma spectabile) and the Freckled Madtom (Noturus nocturnus) into Western Oklahoma.\\" Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Science 60 (1980): 98-99. However, freckled madtom distributions may have extended slightly as water quality in certain regions has improved.  Ecology  The freckled madtom is known to inhabit fast-moving and permanently moving streams that are medium to large in size. The streams usually contain rocky bottoms. Further, this species is sometimes found in the vicinity of undercut banks near masses of sticks and roots. The freckled madtom is primarily an invertivore (feeding on invertebrates). It uses ambush tactics in benthic regions largely at night to feed. It notably consumes insect larvae, including mayfly, black fly, caddisfly, and midge larvae. It also occasionally eats crustaceans. Though it is largely an invertivore, it has also been known to occasionally eat other fish. In southern Mississippi, evidence was found of freckled madtoms feeding on the smaller speckled madtom (N. leptacanthus). To aid in devouring victims, this catfish has a venom glands along smooth spines on the pectoral and dorsal fins.Egge, J.J.D. and Simons, A.M., \\"Evolution of Venom Delivery Structures in Madtom Catfishes (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae).\\" Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 102 (2011): 115-129.Wright, J.J., \\"Diversity, Phylogenetic Distribution, and Origins of Venomous Catfishes.\\" BMC Evolutionary Biology 9 (2009): 1-12.

He was the son of Oliver Stephen Southwell Piper (born 1855), a prominent figure in the British shipbuilding industry, and his wife Ann (born 1851). Both Piper's parents were English and Oliver spent much of his early life in England and Wales. He was one of six children, though two siblings died before adulthood.Census 1911 return In 1898, when the docks at Passage West, Cork, were bought by the Jacobs brothers, Oliver Piper's father Oliver Piper senior was brought over as managing partner of the firm, then called the Channel Dry Docks Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Limited.Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, page 81, (The Society, 1931) After two years Piper moved into Glenbrook House, Cork. Career Oliver Piper senior eventually bought the company he had been directing and re-established the concern as the Queenstown Dry Docks Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. Ltd and in so doing revived its fortunes. His efforts in bringing Winston Churchill, then the First Lord of the Admiralty, on a guided tour of the Royal Victoria Dockyard when he came to view Cork Harbour in the summer of 1912 did not result in as much Admiralty work as hoped, although there were many ships needing repair. Early in 1917, the company was sold to Furness, Withy and Co. Ltd. and a new limited company, the Queenstown Dry Docks Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. Ltd., was formed. Oliver Piper junior was appointed managing director and by the end of 1917, some 800 workers were employed at Passage and Rushbrooke. By August 1919, the Albert Dry Dock had been extended into the river. However, by 29 December 1930, it was proposed to wind up the Queenstown Dry Docks Shipbuilding and Engineering Co.

It has several unusual properties, arising from Conway's discovery that it has a norm zero Weyl vector. In particular it is closely related to the Leech lattice Œõ, and has the Conway group Co1 at the top of its automorphism group. Construction Write Rm,n for the m+n dimensional vector space Rm+n with the inner product of (a1,...,am+n) and (b1,...,bm+n) given by :a1b1+...+ambm ‚àí am+1bm+1 ‚àí ... ‚àí am+nbm+n. The lattice II25,1 is given by all vectors (a1,...,a26) in R25,1 such that either all the ai are integers or they are all integers plus 1/2, and their sum is even. Reflection group The lattice II25,1 is isomorphic to Œõ‚äïH where: *Œõ is the Leech lattice, *H is the 2-dimensional even Lorentzian lattice, generated by 2 norm 0 vectors z and w with inner product ‚Äì1, and the two summands are orthogonal. So we can write vectors of II25,1 as (Œª,m, n) = Œª+mz+nw with Œª in Œõ and m,n integers, where (Œª,m, n) has norm Œª2 ‚Äì2mn. To give explicitly the isomorphism, let w = (0,1,2,3,\\\\dots,22,23,24; 70), and z = (1,0,2,3,\\\\dots,22,23,24; 70), so that the subspace H generated by w and z is the 2-dimensional even Lorentzian lattice. Then H^\\\\perp is isomorphic to w^\\\\perp/w and we recover one of the definitions of Œõ. Conway showed that the roots (norm 2 vectors) having inner product ‚Äì1 with w=(0,0,1) are the simple roots of the reflection group. These are the vectors (Œª,1,Œª2/2‚Äì1) for Œª in the Leech lattice. In other words, the simple roots can be identified with the points of the Leech lattice, and moreover this is an isometry from the set of simple roots to the Leech lattice. The reflection group is a hyperbolic reflection group acting on 25-dimensional hyperbolic space. The fundamental domain of the reflection group has 1+23+284 orbits of vertices as follows: *One vertex at infinity corresponding to the norm 0 Weyl vector. *23 orbits of vertices at infinity meeting a finite number of faces of the fundamental domain. These vertices correspond to the deep holes of the Leech lattice, and there are 23 orbits of these corresponding to the 23 Niemeier lattices other than the Leech lattice. The simple roots meeting one of these vertices form an affine Dynkin diagram of rank 24. *284 orbits of vertices in hyperbolic space. These correspond to the 284 orbits of shallow holes of the Leech lattice. The simple roots meeting any of these vertices form a spherical Dynkin diagram of rank 25. Automorphism group described the automorphism group Aut(II25,1) of II25,1 as follows. * First of all, Aut(II25,1) is the product of a group of order 2 generated by ‚Äì1 by the index 2 subgroup Aut+(II25,1) of automorphisms preserving the direction of time. * The group Aut+(II25,1) has a normal subgroup Ref generated by its reflections, whose simple roots correspond to the Leech lattice vectors. *The group Aut+(II25,1)/Ref is isomorphic to the group of affine automorphisms of the Leech lattice Œõ, and so has a normal subgroup of translations isomorphic to Œõ=Z24, and the quotient is isomorphic to the group of all automorphisms of the Leech lattice, which is a double cover of the Conway group Co1, a sporadic simple group. Vectors Every non- zero vector of II25,1 can be written uniquely as a positive integer multiple of a primitive vector, so to classify all vectors it is sufficient to classify the primitive vectors. Positive norm vectors Any two positive norm primitive vectors with the same norm are conjugate under the automorphism group. Norm zero vectors There are 24 orbits of primitive norm 0 vectors, corresponding to the 24 Niemeier lattices. The correspondence is given as follows: if z is a norm 0 vector, then the lattice z‚ä•/z is a 24-dimensional even unimodular lattice and is therefore one of the Niemeier lattices. The Niemeier lattice corresponding to the norm 0 Weyl vector of the reflection group of II25,1 is the Leech lattice. Norm ‚Äì2 vectors There are 121 orbits of vectors v of norm ‚Äì2, corresponding to the 121 isomorphism classes of 25-dimensional even lattices L of determinant 2. In this correspondence, the lattice L is isomorphic to the orthogonal complement of the vector v. Norm ‚Äì4 vectors There are 665 orbits of vectors v of norm ‚Äì4, corresponding to the 665 isomorphism classes of 25-dimensional unimodular lattices L. In this correspondence, the index 2 sublattice of the even vectors of the lattice L is isomorphic to the orthogonal complement of the vector v. Other vectors There are similar but increasingly complicated descriptions of the vectors of norm ‚Äì2n for n=3, 4, 5, ..., and the number of orbits of such vectors increases quite rapidly.

Ranges and habitat N. stigmosus can be found in the Ohio River valley stretching into distinct locations in Canada, where it is considered endangered. It is a fairly rare species with little data available because such small numbers are observed.Holm E., N.E. Mandrak. 2001. Updated status of the northern madtom, Noturus stigmosus, in Canada. Canadian Field-Naturalist 115:138-144 The northern madtom prefers habitats with relatively swift currents along with sand, silt, or rocky substrates. The species begins spawning around 23 ¬∞C, which is sometime in early summer throughout its range. It is a cavity nester and builds its nests under large rocks and logs.Parsons Glenn R. 1994. Notes on the status and life history of the northern madtom, Noturus stigmosus, in Mississippi. Southeastern Fishes Council Proceedings 30:1-3 Presently, not much is known about the ecology or life history of this species because it is found in such small numbers throughout its range. The species can survive in waters with some turbidity, but not in waters with a high amount of sediment pollution. One of the leading management actions aiding in the successful reproduction of this species is keeping the waters void of sediment pollution and habitat alterations.DFO. 2012. Recovery potential assessment of Northern Madtom (Noturus stigmosus) in Canada. DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Sci. Advis. Rep. 2012/051 The northern madtom is also found along the Allegheny River system running from Canada through the Northeastern United States to Tennessee. However, over much of its range, the species is found in only a few streams/creeks in each state.Felbaum, Mitchell, et al. 1995. Endangered and Threatened Species of Pennsylvania. Harrisburg, PA: Wild Resource Conservation Fund In Canada, the species is confined to only four distinct locations: St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, Thames River (Ontario), and Detroit River. The population status of these four locations has been classified as poor by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. In Pennsylvania, the northern madtom is only found in one creek on the far western edge of the state. Because of this restricted distribution across most of its range, the species has been labeled as critically imperiled. In Tennessee, the species is more common and is classified as vulnerable, instead. However, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency places the northern madtom on the \\"Wildlife in Need of Management Proclamation\\" list. The sporadic distribution of the species across its range suggests that the northern madtom probably has very specific habitat requirements, so is vulnerable to habitat alterations. Ecology The diet of the northern madtom consists of small insects and invertebrates. However, because the species is found in such small numbers, no real evidence supports the specifics of their diet. Little is known as to the quality or quantity of what the northern madtom eats. The northern madtom is found in different habitats throughout its range. In the northern extent of its distribution, the species is found more in larger rivers and even in a few lentic environments such as Lake St. Clair. However, in the lower most stretches of its range, such as in Tennessee, the species is generally more common in small creeks and streams with a somewhat moderate current. Across all regions, the species tends to prefer habitat with sand, gravel, or rock substrates.Carman, S.M. 2001. Special Animal Abstract for Noturus stigmosus (Northern Madtom). Michigan Natural Features Inventory. Lansing, MI. 2 pp The species is somewhat tolerant of turbidity, but avoids areas of high siltation. The northern madtom shares its habitat with several similar species ranging from the very similar mountain madtom to some invasive species, which create competition for both food and resources. However, not much is known about the specifics of the effect of this competition on the northern madtoms because they are found in such small numbers. Life history Both sexes of N. stigmosus come into reproductive condition in early summer. However, spawning does not take place until the water temperature reaches 23 ¬∞C. The species is thought to produce only one clutch per year with an average clutch size of 32 to 160 eggs. The wide range of clutch size can possibly be caused by females laying eggs in multiple nests. The northern madtom is a cavity-nesting species; they have been found in depressions under large rocks, logs, and inside crayfish burrows. Their nests have also been found inside anthropogenic debris such as bottles, cans, and boxes. Males guard the eggs, and when the eggs hatch, the adult males continue to guard them for around one month. In Canada, the juveniles are found mainly in areas with a water temperature between 19.5 and 28 ¬∞C, a pH of 8.03 to 8.47, a dissolved oxygen content between 6.0 and 10.05, a depth between 0.06 and 0.90 meters, and a near bottom velocity between 0 and 0.55 meters per second. Although this sounds like very specific data, the many species fall into this data set, and little is known about the specifics of the northern madtom's life history. Current management Noturus stigmosus is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" on the federal level. However, throughout the majority of its distribution, especially in the northern region, many states have it classified as \\"critically imperiled\\". The reason for this is the sporadic distribution and small numbers associated with the species. These characteristics also show that the northern madtom probably has very specific habitat parameters is probably very sensitive to habitat alterations. One of the main causes for the decline of the northern madtom is loss of suitable habitat. Several factors contribute to this, ranging from the changing of the landscape for anthropogenic purposes to the building of small dams in the creeks where the species occurs. Increases in the amount of stream siltation are also believed to have negative impacts on the species. Because so little information is available regarding the habitat requirements and life history strategies of N. stigmosus, little to no management is occurring that specifically targets the species. The current management practices consist of attempting to conserve the species natural habitat through maintaining stream flow, avoiding bank erosion and soil deposition, and altering stream bank habitat. Individual counts are conducted via seining and trapping. However, because the species is so rare in the northern portion of its range, not much is learned from these collections.

Early life He was born in Ta≈ülƒ±ca (Pljevlja, now Montenegro), in the Bosnia Eyalet.Uzun√ßar≈üƒ±lƒ± 1954, p. 424 He was the kdhya of Grand Vizier Ahmed K√∂pr√ºl√º (s. 1661‚Äì1676), and later the Sultan's master of the horse. Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire After Sarƒ± S√ºleyman Pasha was appointed grand vizier, he immediately began to write desperate letters to the Great Khan of the Crimean Khanate and the pashas of Timi»ôoara, Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and Osijek in order to reorganize and reinforce the battered Ottoman Army in Hungary, struggling during the Battle of Buda (1686). Although Sarƒ± S√ºleyman Pasha made several attempts to break the blockade around Buda, the city was ultimately captured by Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Soon afterwards the Ottomans had even lost Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. S√ºleyman Pasha thereafter commanded his forces to hold what remained of the Ottoman north against their opponents and even sent Mehmet Agha to negotiate peace with Donat John Heissler at Guttentag. After the defeat at Moh√°cs, the Ottoman army started a rebellion against the grand vizier. S√ºleyman Pasha, fearful that the rebellion would result in his death, escaped from the commanding position, first to Belgrade and then, rather foolishly, to Constantinople, where he took refuge at the house of an old friend, a Jew named Salomon. At the beginning of September 1687, news about his defeat and escape came to Constantinople. After Mehmed IV received this news, he proclaimed Abaza Siyavu≈ü Pasha as the new commander of the armed forces, and, eventually, as the new grand vizier. Soon after this, S√ºleyman Pasha was apprehended and executed. Two months later, the sultan himself was also removed from power as the result of the defeat in the Battle of Moh√°cs, and was replaced by sultan S√ºleyman II.

The story was first published in the seventh issue of the Slovo anthology (Moscow, 1917) and remains to this day one of the most talked about Bunin's stories, being the first piece of work in the Russian literature featuring a serial killer as the main character.The Works by I.A.Bunin. Vol.IV. Novelets and Stories, 1912-1917. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. 1965. Commentaries, pp.492-494. Mark Aldanov considered the story as one of the Bunin's best. Some scholars regard \\"Loopy Ears\\" as a dark parody on Crime and Punishment and one striking example of Bunin's deep antagonism towards Fyodor Dostoyevsky and the ideas he represented.  Background  Originally Bunin planned to write a large novel about a serial killer, \\"vyrodok\\" (a moral degenerate) named Sokolovych, for which the now known text of the story would form a kind of primal factual basis. In the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (–¶–ì–ê–õ–ò) there are several expanded versions of the story, each pointing to directions in which it was supposed to develop into a novel. One of them feature as its obvious turning point Sokolovich's words addressed to a policeman: \\"In this case I am more of a sufferer than a criminal. Why? This does not concern you in any way\\". In another rough draft Sokolovich's family past and socio-psychological aspects of an environment were explored. In it, the murderer, arrested in Vologda a month after the act, asks for a permission to produce a hand-written account of what preceded it and (according to the author) \\"comes out with something much more cruel and bizarre than might have been expected even taking into account the nature of the atrocity committed.\\"  Crime and Punishment parallels  According to the literary scholar Aleksandr Dolinin, Looped Ears (that's his version of the title's translation) \\"rewrites\\" Crime and Punishment, constructing a \\"recognizable Dostoevskian world of gloomy, oppressive Saint Petersburg with its misty streets, demonic slums, seedy taverns and hotels, and then exploding it from within.\\" The story's two characters, the murderer Sokolovich and the prostitute Korolkova, his victim, are \\"the grim travesties of Raskolnikov and Sonia lacking any redeeming moral aspects of their models.\\" Bunin's down-to- earth treatment of murder and prostitution, argues the critic, is intended to debunk Dostoevsky's melodramatic 'humanization' of the subject. Sokolovich takes it upon himself to take issue with the author of Crime and Punishment in his monologue, expounding his own philosophy of murder:  External links  * –ü–µ—Ç–ª–∏—Å—Ç—ã–µ —É—à–∏.

Description The thallus of L. scrobiculata has broad, concave and rounded lobes, rather wider than in Lobaria pulmonaria. The upper surface has large shallow depressions (scrobiculate, hence the specific name). Blue-grey soredia, the asexual reproductive bodies, are always present along ridges and on the margins. The thallus has a blue-grey colour and pliable texture when hydrated but assumes a light grey or yellow-grey colour and papery texture when dehydrated. The underside is covered by light brown tomentum and rhizines except on raised areas that correspond to the depressions on the upper surface. Fungal fruit bodies (ascocarps), rarely present, are small dark red discs with a thick inflexed margin. Thallus lobes grow away from the substrate in irregular patches as in L. pulmonaria but unlike the more regular rounded and flattened colonies of L. quercizans, L. amplissima and L. virens. The algal symbiont is the cyanobacterium Nostoc, in contrast to the green algae in most other species of Lobaria. Distribution Lobaria scrobiculata is mostly found in temperate climates (K√∂ppen climate classification Cf and Df climates, especially Cfb and Dfb) which have high rainfall, especially coastal districts of north west Europe, north eastern North America and north western North America, but there are also a few known occurrences in warmer countries such as Kenya. The distribution records are possibly very incomplete and biased towards Europe and North America. The map data at www.discoverlife.org shows the worldwide distribution of some of the recorded locations for L. scrobiculata. In southern England, which may be representative of lowland western Europe, Lobaria species are very restricted in their distribution, in part because of a history of air pollution, forest loss and fragmentation but also because the climate is sub-optimal with relatively low rainfall. In contrast the cool, moist and mountainous regions of north west Scotland have a relatively high frequency of L. scrobiculata on suitable trees. Ecology Lobarias are primarily found growing upon tree bark. The type of tree is important with deciduous angiosperms strongly preferred to gymnosperms. Within these angiosperms, rough barked mature trees with relatively high bark pH such as oaks or maples are a more suitable substrate than smooth-barked species such as birches. In the UK sessile oak (Quercus petraea), pedunculate oak (Q. robur) and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) are the most important. In eastern North America sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (A. rubrum) are favoured but yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) can also be colonised. In the lowlands of southern England the presence of Lobarias is considered indicative of long forest habitat continuity for a particular site. In regions of high rainfall, low air pollution and a higher frequency of suitable habitat the species can be more mobile and able to colonise younger forests and trees but is still generally more prevalent in old-growth forests. The presence of Lobaria species, along with certain other lichens, has been used as part of an index of forest continuity and habitat quality in Britain. Uses The lichen is used for food by the Yupik people of Alaska.

The club is a member of the Country Rugby League and compete in the Illawarra Rugby League premiership. The club play out of Figtree Oval, Figtree. Wests wear red and blue jerseys and have won 14 premierships. Wests Illawarra Leagues club is a thriving club in Unanderra. History Wests formed in 1949 with the amalgamation of clubs in the district (primarily Unanderra and Mount Keira). The Leagues Club was established in Unanderra and opened in 1956. The Red Devils won the premiership the following year with a 22‚Äì6 win over Wollongong. They repeated this effort in 1959 when they defeated Northern Suburbs 12‚Äì6 in the Grand Final.Western Suburbs History With Don Parish at the helm as captain-coach, Wests took back-to-back titles in 1969‚Äì70. Warren Ryan continued this trend the following two seasons when he took over, defeating Thirroul (18‚Äì11 in 1971, and 23‚Äì9 in 1972). Cronulla Sharks legend, Tommy Bishop also guided the team to a premiership in 1978. Wests were again premiers two years later, winning in 1980 and 1981. The following year the Illawarra Steelers were accepted into the NSWRL premiership, thus all the sides in the league became feeder clubs to this side. Being premiers, a large portion of the Red Devils were contracted to the Steelers. This made life difficult in the 1982 premiership for the Red Devils, but within three years they won another premiership. They followed this up with another in 1989 and 1991. The Red Devils went through a dry spell from here, not winning the premiership for 18 years. They came close during Brendon Reeves' reign in 2005. They did eventually break the drought in 2009 when they defeated reigning premiers, Thirroul, 14‚Äì4 under coach Paul McGregor in his first season. They went back-to-back with a 24‚Äì0 win in 2010, again over the Butchers. In 2011, Wests made it a treble of grand final wins with a 34‚Äì24 victory over Helensburgh. The Red Devils were unable to match the team of the 60-70s that won four consecutive premierships when they lost 20‚Äì16 to finals rivals Thirroul in the 2012 grand final. In 2018 Wests found enough to hold off Thirroul 18‚Äì16 to claim their first Illawarra League crown in eight seasons. The Devils ran in four first-half tries to lead 18‚Äì0 at the break before a second-half fightback saw the Butchers get within two with 18 minutes to play.https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/5635018/gutsy-devils-tackle- their-way-to-2018-title/?cs=2375 Players Notable former players {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; width:79%;\\" |- style=\\"background:#c1d8ff;\\" !rowspan=2 |Player ! colspan=\\"2\\"|Country Firsts ! colspan=\\"2\\"|City Firsts ! colspan=\\"2\\"|Country Origin ! colspan=\\"2\\"|New South Wales ! colspan=\\"2\\"|Australia |- style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" !|Years !|Apps !|Years !|Apps !|Years !|Apps !|Years !|Apps !|Years !|Apps |- align=center align=left|Bob Fulton  1967‚Äì1978 9  1971‚Äì72, 1974 6 1968‚Äì78 51 |- align=center align=left |Graham Lye 1969‚Äì70     - align=center align=leftDavid Waite 1973 1   1973‚Äì74 2 1973‚Äì74 6 |- align=center align=leftJohn Dorahyhttp://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/search/?q=john+dorahy 1972‚Äì73 2 1980 1 1988 1 1979 2 1978 2 |- align=center align=leftRoyce Ayliffe    1982 3 1981 1 |- align=center align=leftGarry Jackhttp://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/search/?q=garry+jack 1986 1 1984‚Äì85 2 1987 1 1984‚Äì89 17 1984‚Äì88 29 |- align=center align=leftSteve Roach 1986-86 2 1984 1 1988, 1990 2 1984‚Äì86, 1988, 1990‚Äì91 17 1985‚Äì86, 1988‚Äì91 27 |- align=center align=leftJason Ryles   2001, 2003, 2005 3 2002‚Äì05 8 2001‚Äì02, 2004‚Äì05 15 |- align=center align=leftBrett Stewart   2007 1 2007‚Äì12 8 2007 1 |- align=center align=leftGlenn Stewart   2008, 2010‚Äì11 3 2009, 2012 5 2008‚Äì09 5 |- align=center align=leftBruce Olive 1959‚Äì62    1958  - align=center align=leftAl Maddelena    1969  - align=center align=leftBrian Hetherington 1977, 1984 2 1986 1  1984, 1986 2  |- align=center align=leftBrett Rodwell   1991, 1993, 1995 3 1995 1  |} *Beau Ryan *Jackson Hastings (2014‚Äì Sydney Roosters) Players in bold represent current NRL players.

He was first retained by John Mason, the proprietor of the territory that later became New Hampshire, to administer his holdings. Arriving at the Piscataqua River in 1634, he administered Mason's settlement (roughly including present-day Portsmouth and some nearby communities) until Mason's death in 1635. (In some New Hampshire histories he is styled as \\"governor\\" of the Mason properties). He thereafter moved further up the coast, settling in what is now Scarborough, Maine. He briefly acted as deputy governor of the Province of Maine in the colonial administration of Thomas Gorges, before the area came under the control of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was opposed to Massachusetts rule, and was arrested on one occasion for his resistance. When the area was granted to James, Duke of York in 1664, it became part of the Province of New York, and Josselyn was appointed a magistrate. There is no record of his death; a letter date May 10, 1683 mentions his passing.

He was named All-City twice in football, garnering All-State honors as well as named to Michigan's 'Dream Team' as a senior. Played both safety and quarterback. A standout basketball player, garnering All-City honors twice including the City Championship in 1998. He averaged 18 points and over seven rebounds for his prep career playing guard. Only played one year of baseball as a sophomore, playing third base. Shined in track and field, claiming the City Championship in the 4x100 meter relay as a senior. Finished fifth in the state in 1998 on the 4x200 meter relay team. College career Duke Bryant was a dual sport athlete at Duke University playing football and basketball. During his freshman year, 1998-1999, Bryant was a reserve with Duke University's basketball team. The Blue Devils went 37-2 overall and were undefeated in the Atlantic Coast Conference. They finished #2 in the country after losing the 1999 national championship game to the University of Connecticut. Three of his teammates later had long professional careers: i.e., Shane Battier, Elton Brand, and Corey Maggette. Bryant did not play basketball after his freshman year, concentrating exclusively on football. Bryant became the starting quarterback at Duke midway through the 2000 season (when he was a sophomore) and continued in that role as a junior. During his junior season, he passed for 2,454 yards and 11 touchdowns. Duke's football program was somewhat less successful than the basketball program during those years.

Data extracted from the The name \\"'capsulatus'\\" coming from the alga's large capsule which surrounds the cell. This unicellular algal species was discovered in 1990 in the West Pacific Ocean and has characteristic reproduction methods as well as an interesting and potentially exploitable morphology. Miyashita et al. 1993 This is the only species in the genus, though various strains exist, for example URI 266G is the Atlantic clone. Morphology The most notable feature of P. capsulatus's morphology is its large capsule composed of an exo-polysaccharide which has been dubbed \\"capsulan\\". Capsulan is thought to be synthesised in the Golgi and then secreted through the decapore (a specialised circle of 10 pores through the cell wall). After exiting the decapore capsulan becomes visible and it is thought that it cross links with divalent ions in the seawater.Sieburth et al. 1999 Widespread occurrence of the oceanic ultraplankter Prasinococcus capsulatus (Prasinophyceae), the diagnostic \\"Golgi-Decapore complex\\" and the newly discovered polysaccharide \\"capsulan\\" Research is currently underway to find potential applications for capsulan and how to maximise its production. The capsule's function is not clearly defined but various explanations have been suggested. One is that it offers protection to newly divided cells which lack a thick cell wall, another is that it provides a template for daughter cells to synthesise their new cell wall. The capsule may also interfere with filter feeding, thus reducing predation. In similar species, capsules have been noted for their antibacterial properties Davidson and Marchant 1987 \\"Binding of manganese by Antarctic Phaeocystis pouchetii and the role of bacteria in its release\\" and a conspicuous lack of bacteria as well as viral particles in impure samples of P. capsulatus has been observed. Reproduction Sexual reproduction has not been observed in P. capsulatus but its mode of asexual reproduction is quite distinctive. The cell splits into two daughter cells while remaining inside the original cell wall, one daughter cell then begins to enlarge, while the other is pushed out of a small hole in the parental cell wall. The larger cell remains in the original cell wall while the other migrates to the edge of the capsule which surrounds them both. Before leaving the parental capsule this daughter has synthesised its own firm cell wall after which it leaves the parental capsule and begins to produce its own capsule. Others claim that this mode of reproduction immature cells with thinner walls older cells with thicker walls must first discard the paternal cell wall before undergoing binary fission and then each daughter cell produces its own new cell wall. This is evidenced by abandoned cell walls residing in mature cells' capsules. Distribution P. capsulatus is an important contributor to oceanic biomass especially in late winter to early spring. Its range covers much of the West Pacific and West Atlantic Oceans. Bio-remediation P. capsulatus is currently being studied for use in Carbon Dioxide capture, especially important as it recycles this carbon into capsulan which may be a useful compound.Kurano, 1995, Fixation and Utilization of Carbon Dioxide by Microalgal Photosynthesis References Category:Palmophyllophyceae Category:Plants described in 1993 ","title":"Prasinococcus capsulatus"},{"id":"32486327","text":"Eopaussus balticus is a species of beetle in the family Carabidae, the only species in the genus Eopaussus.

Perkins operates from a 1910 historic Tudor home and carriage building in Moorestown, New Jersey (Burlington County), as well as a former printing press in Collingswood, New Jersey (Camden County). Recognized by the New Jersey State Council on the Arts as a Major Presenting Organization and receiving a Citation of Excellence, Perkins Center offers arts programs that promote participation, understanding, and communication among diverse audiences.  History  In 1815, the triangular piece of property that now includes Perkins Center for the Arts in ‚ÄúWestern Moorestown‚Äù was established by Joseph French and John Perkins as the Fairview Nurseries. It later became known as Tan Yard Farm and then Pinehurst Farm. The property was utilized as a nursery specializing in ornamental trees. Some of the specimen trees on the property today are believed to be from this time. The home on the former nursery property was built in 1910 by Herbert C. Wise, a noted Philadelphia architect, as a wedding gift to Dudley and Alice Perkins. The home, named by the family as Evergreen Lawn, is built in the Tudor Revival style inspired by English manor homes of the 15th and 16th centuries. The front porch tie beam is inscribed \\"D&AP; 1910\\", for Dudley and Alice Perkins and the date the house was built. At or around 1930, the carriage house was built in the Craftsman style, the lower level served as a garage and the upper level an apartment. The same year, the second level porch at the original home was enclosed into a sleeping porch. Perkins Center for the Arts, Moorestown, NJ Dudley died in 1918 of influenza during the epidemic that occurred soon after the Great War (WWI). The couple had one son, Thomas Haines Dudley Jr. Soon after T.H. Dudley Sr.‚Äôs death, Alice Perkins invited her sister, Mable (Sullivan) and husband Francis D‚ÄôOlier to live with her at Evergreen Lawn. After Alice‚Äôs and Frank‚Äôs death and the death of Dudley, Jr. at the age of 48, Mabel (Sullivan) D‚ÄôOlier was the sole occupant in the home. Mable purchased the home from Dudley Jr‚Äôs estate. Upon her death, the property and home were bequeathed to the Township of Moorestown to be used in perpetuity as a park or other suitable township purpose, Mable stipulated that the point of property between the house and where Kings Highway meets Camden Avenue be maintained as open space for the community and no buildings or structures should be placed on it, she stated that it be referred to as the Perkins Lawn. In the early 1970s, the township was contemplating the sale or demolition of the historic building. Responding to this situation, a group of concerned Moorestown citizens including Sally Harrall, Jean Gaasch, Frank Keenan and Louis Matlack fought to save Evergreen Lawn and had the buildings listed on the National and State Registers of Historic Places in 1975. Thanks to community involvement and support, the township‚Äôs Recreational Advisory Committee recommended that the building be retained for use as a self-sustaining cultural arts center. Perkins Center for the Arts was created and was officially incorporated in 1977 as a non-profit community arts center serving the residents of Moorestown and the entire southern New Jersey region. Around this time, the remainder of the property was also designated as Open Space and in 1981, the 5.5 acre property was designated as an Arboretum. Perkins Center is currently operating under its second 25-year lease with the Township of Moorestown. The maintenance and upkeep of this historic site is solely dependent on public support and tax deductible donations.  Collingswood location  In 2002, Perkins expanded to a second facility in Collingswood, NJ, reaching new audiences, expanding their programs in Camden County, and supporting a multi year arts initiative in Camden. Plans are underway to fully renovate the building to include quality art studios, classrooms and exhibition spaces within an environmentally sensitive \\"green building.\\" Perkins Center for the Arts, Collingswood, NJ  Programs at Perkins  The Center‚Äôs programs include: * Studio Classes in the visual and performing arts for all ages * An Exhibition Series which promotes and supports emerging and established artists * A Conservatory of Music with individual and group music lessons * A Performance Series including classical Family Concerts and folk/contemporary Concerts * An ARTS (Art Reaching The Students) Residency Program which matches professional artists with schools for extended residencies in their respective disciplines * A Summer Arts Camp bringing urban and suburban youth together in a creative arts environment * An Out-of-School program for at-risk youth * A Mural/Community Gardens Initiative in Camden, NJ * A Folklife Center to document and engage ethnic groups and communities in the tri-county area (Burlington, Camden & Gloucester).

The project features paper cut-outs based on the title character of the 1964 children's book Flat Stanley. The project was designed to facilitate the improvement of the reading and writing skills of elementary school students, while also promoting an interest in learning about different people and places. In 2001 Hubert was presented the Prime Minister's Awards for Teaching Excellence, an annual award issued by the Prime Minister of Canada to honour outstanding and innovative elementary and secondary school teachers. History Flat Stanley on a boat as part of the Flat Stanley Project Dale Hubert first introduced The Flat Stanley Project to his students at Wilfrid Jury Public School in 1995. The project's name comes from the eponymous character of the children's book Flat Stanley. Written in 1964 by American author Jeff Brown, the book centers around the life of character Stanley Lambchop, a boy who is accidentally flattened. In an interview with CNN in 2005, Hubert explained: \\"In the book, by Jeff Brown, Stanley gets squashed flat by a falling bulletin board. Stanley's parents rolled him up, put him in an envelope and mailed him to his friend in California. And that just seemed like a way of communicating that grade-three students might enjoy.\\" Students involved in The Flat Stanley Project are read the story of Flat Stanley and are subsequently given black-and-white cut-outs of him for them to color. The students are also asked to write a story about him, including details such as where he is from, his daily routine and his interests, then they mail their Stanley to someone, such as a friend or relative in another country, or a student at another school participating in the program. The person receiving the Flat Stanley is asked to take a picture with the cut-out doll and to send a letter back, either via email or regular mail, to the student recounting Flat Stanley's adventures along with the accompanying photo. The student then shares the photo and letter with their class. By then end of its first year there were 13 classrooms participating in the project across the province of Ontario. Classrooms in the United States were short to follow suit and by 2006 the program had grown to 6,000 classes in 47 nations. By 2011 it was reported that at least 88 countries were participating in the program annually. In the media Flat Stanley befriends a shop owner in Kano, Nigeria The Flat Stanley Project's popularity increased in the 2000s after it received increased media attention. Similar to the Travelling gnome prank, photos of Flat Stanley began to appear in the news media and on social media sites with the cut-out doll pictured in increasingly exotic and unusual locales and with various celebrities. In the run-up to the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, Arnold Schwarzenegger took his son's Flat Stanley with him on the campaign trail, including his appearance that year on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Clint Eastwood carried his daughter's Stanley along with him on the red carpet at the Oscars in 2005. US Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have all had their pictures taken with him as well as former US Vice President Dick Cheney. Flat Stanley travelled on Presidential airliner Air Force One accompanied by then- Secretary of State Colin Powell and also orbited the Earth aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. According to the February 26, 2009 broadcast of Countdown with Keith Olbermann, Flat Stanley was on board US Airways Flight 1549 when it was forced to make an unpowered emergency water landing in the Hudson River. He was carried to safety in the briefcase of his travelling companion. Flat Stanley has also been photographed alongside such people as television personalities Steve Irwin, Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay, NASCAR drivers Joe Nemechek and Richard Petty, former heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali, NFL quarterback Peyton Manning, musicians Clay Aiken and Willie Nelson, as well as Ireland's oldest person. The Flat Stanley Project was featured in a 2004 episode of the animated TV series King of the Hill titled \\"How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Alamo\\", in which Peggy Hill takes photographs of a Flat Stanley doll in order to help teach kids about geography and safety issues. Stanley has also made appearances on the television series The West Wing and Everybody Loves Raymond as well as game shows Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and Jeopardy!. Flat Stanley goes hi-tech In 2006, four schools in rural Chesterfield County, South Carolina implemented a year-long project called Flat Stanley Goes Hi-Tech. Project participants communicated and shared photographs via email and web-cam with students attending participating schools in Chile and Nova Scotia, Canada. The project involved 9 teachers and over 200 students. The progress of the project was captured in an hour-long documentary film that was broadcast on South Carolina Educational Television (SCETV).Flat Stanley Goes Hi-Tech official website - Main page Flat Stanley Goes Hi-Tech official website - The Production Links to the video as well links to interviews with the cast and crew are available at the Flat Stanley Goes Hi-tech website.Flat Stanley Goes Hi-Tech official website - View the Film & Trailer Flat Stanley Goes Hi-Tech won the TIPS (Technology Innovation Programs in Schools) Award for South Carolina in 2006, presented at South Carolina Ed-Tech, an annual educational technology conference held by The South Carolina Association for Educational Technology (SCAET) in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Variations The Flat Stanley Project has inspired similar projects worldwide. A traced and life-sized variation of \\"Flat Self\\", Flat Stanley sent from Ft. Wayne, Indiana, going for a ride in Greensboro, North Carolina Flat Mark In 2003 Karlo Cabrera, a teacher at Fenside Public School in Toronto created \\"Flat Mark\\" as part of a civics and literacy project. The idea for Flat Mark came from nine-year-old student Steven Matskoulis, who had visited the Parliament Buildings with his parents and had suggested it to Cabrera after having read the children's book Flat Stanley. Cabrera's fourth grade class sent Flat Mark to the newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin along with a letter that asked that he take Flat Mark along with him on the job. Flat Mark attended several transition meetings, met with Mr. Martin's Chief of Staff Tim Murphy and principal secretary Francis Fox, toured Rideau Hall and attended a meeting between Martin and the Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson. Flat Stan the Man In 2010 the St. Louis Cardinals launched the \\"Stand for Stan\\" campaign with the goal of convincing President Barack Obama to present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Stan \\"The Man\\" Musial. Fans were also encouraged to download copies of \\"Flat Stan the Man\\" from the club's website and to post pictures of themselves with their cut-out to the club's website. The cause was moved forward by Senators Christopher Bond, Republican of Missouri; Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri; and Richard J.

Musial was presented his award in a ceremony at the White House on February 15, 2011. Flat Stanley Cup After the Chicago Blackhawks' Stanley Cup victories in 2010, 2013 and 2015, the Chicago Tribune newspaper offered a cut-out \\"Flat Stanley Cup\\" for fans to download. Blackhawks fans were encouraged then post pictures of themselves and the cup on Twitter with the hashtag #flatstanleycup or they could post them to the Tribune site. Flat Francis The Catholic Extension‚Äîan organization based in Chicago that raises money for dioceses in need across the United States‚Äîcreated the \\"Flat Francis\\" campaign to officially welcome Pope Francis on his visit to the United States in 2015. The organization created the website flatfrancis.org where participants could download a copy of Flat Francis. Participants were asked to take pictures of themselves with their Flat Francis and post them to social media sites along with the hashtag #FlatFrancis.

The school operates an elementary school, middle school, and high school on two separate campuses. Grades kindergarten through 7th \\"loop\\" with their teachers for 2 years. With both campuses combined, the student body is approximately 1,300 pupils, with about 100 per grade level. Each year, the random lottery that selects new families to attend CSD leaves over 3,000 students on the wait list for entry. When CSD originally started under the name Children's Community School (CCS) in 2001, it was a secular private school out of Lake Norman Baptist Church in Huntersville, North Carolina. The school originally had only one kindergarten class, but it expanded by one grade over its first three years. In its fourth year, it became a charter school. With the school now having around 60 students, the directors decided that a new building was needed to accommodate the larger number of students, so they purchased the former Elox manufacturing facility in Davidson, NC. That building now houses the kindergarten through 7th grades, while the 8th through 12th grades reside about 1 mile up the road in a newer space. In the high school building, the 8th grade resides in a separate wing from the high school grades. CSD is known for its inclusion exceptional children's program, integration of the arts and its commitment to service. Students are engaged in service beginning in kindergarten and expand their service with a service- learning program called Practicum in 8th grade where there are 6-8 students in each group. They continue in high school by participating in service Fridays through the advisory program made up of small groups of 12-14 students per teacher. The arts program at CSD is an integral part of the curriculum. Students are exposed to a variety of arts classes, and many high school students choose a concentration for their 4 years. The theater program is notable for always having a show in rehearsal, performing 4 times yearly even through the summer months. The sports program and boosters are currently raising funds to build a Sports Complex for outdoor sports teams. The high school teams have won multiple state championships including 2 in women's soccer, 4 in women's volleyball, and women's cross country. The school also has multiple state Wells Fargo Cup wins noting a culmination of points among all school sports.

Final rule to determine Glaucocarpum suffrutescens (Toad-flax cress) to be an endangered species. Federal Register October 6, 1987. There are seven populations of the plant located in three main areas. Five of the seven populations contain 250 or fewer plants. This plant is threatened by hydrocarbon exploration and the mining of oil shale and tar sands. All the populations of the plant are located on land which has been leased for oil and gas exploration. Its habitat is located over a large deposit of oil shale which may be a target for extraction. When the plant was added to the Endangered Species List, parts of populations had been destroyed during energy development activities. The populations are already somewhat isolated due to habitat fragmentation, which is increased by roads running through the area. Dust from the roads and from energy activity may negatively affect the plant in several ways. Some of the processes that affect the habitat and the plant also affect the plant's pollinators, such as bees. Other threats include off-road vehicle use, grazing, and the mining of surface rock for use as building stone.

Childhood and youth  Philipp Reinhard was born in 1664 Bischofsheim am hohen Steg (now Rheinbischofsheim) as a child of Johann Reinhard II of Hanau-Lichtenberg and the Countess Palatine Anna Magdalena of Zweibr√ºcken-Birkenfeld. When his father died in 1666, his mother and his uncle Duke Christian II of Zweibr√ºcken-Birkenfeld (1654‚Äì1717) became guardian for him and his younger brother Johann Reinhard III. He was educated together with his younger brother Johann Reinhard III, initially in Strasbourg. In 1678, they moved to Babenhausen, where their mother lived at the time. In 1678, they started a Grand Tour to the Alsace, Switzerland and Geneva. In 1680, the travelled for a year in Savoy and Turin, in 1681 to Paris, in 1683 to the Netherlands, England and some French provinces. In early 1684, they were in Milan, from there they went to see the carnival in Venice, followed by a trip to Rome (with audiences with Pope Innocent XII and queen Christina of Sweden), then to Naples, Florence, Modena, Parma and Mantua. In 1686, they visited the imperial court in Vienna and on the way back, they traveled to Bohemia and visited the Electoral Saxon court in Dresden.  Government   Policy  Philipp Reinhard came to the throne of Hanau- M√ºnzenberg at the age of 16 on . His uncle Friedrich Casimir had financially ruined the county with his escapades and he was overthrown by his family. They put Philipp Reinhard on the throne, but as he was still a minor, his guardians acted as regents until 1687. His younger brother Johann Reinhard III was put on the throne of Hanau-Lichtenberg, which had also been ruined by Friedrich Casimir. The district of Babenhausen was awarded to Hanau-M√ºnzenberg; this decision was confirmed in a treaty in 1691. Philipp Reinhard came of age in 1687 and began to rule independently. In 1691, Duke Christian II filed his final report on the guardianship. Philipp Reinhard's reign was marked by a thoughtful territorial and fiscal policy that tried to repair the damage done by the Thirty Years' War and the reign of his predecessor.  Foreign policy  In 1692, Philipp Reinhard was elected as the permanent director of the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts. In 1704, Philipp Reinhard was made a member of the Order of the Black Eagle by King Friedrich I of Prussia. For the investiture, he had to travel to Berlin, which he did in 1710. In 1711, Emperor Karl VI visited Hanau while travelling to Frankfurt for his coronation. His territorial policies met with little success. The districts Schwarzenfels and Kellerei with Naumburg Castle had been pledged to Hesse- Kassel. He tried to redeem them and failed. He did manage to redeem some smaller territories, notably Konradsdorf monastery. He exchanged some territory with Isenburg, swapping parts of Hain in Dreieich for a share in Dudenhofen. He also bought the Gronauer Court, which formerly belonged to the Ilbenstadt monastery.  Domestic policy  During his reign, religious refugees migrated into the county, as had happened 100 years earlier during the reign of Count Philipp Ludwig II, especially after Louis XIV had revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685 and the Waldensians began to be persecuted in Savoy. The refugees were admitted, partly as a humanitarian act and partly to strengthen the county's economic position. The Waldensians only stayed in Hanau temporarily, though.  Elevation to the rank of prince  In the older literature it is repeatedly claimed that Philipp Reinhard would have obtained the rank of Prince. This appears not to be the case. There is no record of such an elevation, neither in the archives of Hanau, which have since been moved to the Hessian State Archive at Marburg, nor in the Austrian House-, Court- and State Archives in Vienna, nor is there a record of any related payments. It has been documented that Philipp Reinhard spent time and expenses to obtain such a title and that he never used one, which would have been a very strange behaviour if he had received it.  Culture  Philippsruhe Castle Frankfurt Gate, west side In 1701, Philipp Reinhard began the construction of Philippsruhe Castle, which was named after him, in the village of Kesselstadt, to the west of Hanau, just outside the city gate. In 1712, he began the construction of new stables for the City Palace in Hanau (later Hanau's City Hall; today the \\"Congress Park Hanau\\"). This project was completed after his death by his brother Johann Reinhard III. Philipp Reinhard was able to complete, during his lifetime, the construction of the college building, which today houses the city library, opposite the City Palace.  Marriage and issue  On , Philipp Reinhard married his cousin, Countess Palatine Magdalena Claudia (born: 16 September 1668; died 28 November 1704), the daughter of Duke Christian II of Zweibr√ºcken-Birkenfeld (born: 22 June 1637; died 26 April 1717). Her dowry was . This marriage produced: * Stillborn child (1691), buried in the crypt in the Lutheran Church (now called: Old St. Johann's Church) in HanauSuchier: Grabmonumente, p. 46 * Stillborn child (1693) * Katharina Magdalene of Hanau (born: ; died: , buried in the crypt in the Lutheran Church in HanauSuchier: Grabmonumente, p. 48 After the death of his first wife, Philipp Reinhard was engaged with Elisabeth Louise Christine of Mauchenheim named Bechtolsheim, a lady in waiting of his first wife. He intended to marry her after she had been elevated to countess. Both his relatives and his councillors opposed the marriage on the grounds that she was of lower birth. He then broke off the engagement and bought her off with moneyL√∂wenstein, p. 21 On 26 December 1705, Philipp Reinhard married Charlotte Wilhelmine (born: ; died: 5 April 1767), the daughter of Duke Johann Ernst IV of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Her dowry was also . This second marriage remained childless.  Death  Philipp Reinhard died at his Philippsruhe Castle on 4 October 1712 alone. He was buried in the family vault in the Lutheran Church (now the St. Johann's Church in Hanau. The tomb was destroyed when Hanau bombed during the Second World War. His second wife, Wilhelmine Charlotte, survived him by 55 years. His younger brother Johann Reinhard III, who had until then ruled the county of Hanau-Lichtenberg, inherited Hanau-M√ºnzenberg. This would be the last time all of Hanau was united in one hand.

Alma Mater faculty has participated at the leading universities' events including those of Harvard, UCLA, and Yale. Their expert opinion appeared in leading media such as The Guardian, The Boston Globe, and Euractiv.  History   Origins and early years  A meeting of the Alma Mater Europaea senate In 2007 European Academy of Sciences and Arts Salzburg (EASA) established Alma Mater Europaea as an academic institution that provides an organizational frame and contents for cultural and professional renewal of the Danube region. AMEU - ECM is part of Alma Mater Europaea as an academic and research institution, a network of over 250 academic teachers and over 40 academic institutions from 12 countries in the Danube region, also connecting 1400 excellent researchers, several Nobel prize recipients. In 2011, EASA gave an institutional patronage to the European Centre Maribor, including it into the newly established university network Alma Mater Europaea, established particularly for the Danube region. A new project was placed in hands of AMEU - ECM under this patronage; namely organization of the Regional Interactive Educational Network (RIEN). In 2011 students started studying management and social gerontology. Alma Mater Europaea started offering environmental studies and European studies in 2012 and archival science in 2013. In March 2013 the first group of 50 students graduated. The president of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts prof. ddr. Felix Unger gave the opening speech.  Campus   Locations  Alma Mater Europaea operates in several different cities in Slovenia. The main office and academic facilities are located in Maribor. The academic programmes also take place in Ljubljana and Murska Sobota. Some of the academic programmes mostly enroll students from Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. The lectures, seminars and exams take place in Zagreb, Croatia. AMEU also has its affiliates in Salzburg, Austria.  Buildings  Alma Mater Europaea has its headquarters in Slovenska Ulica 17, Maribor, Slovenia. Prior to July 2015 the headquarters were on Gosposka Ulica 1. The headquarters consist of several floors containing administration offices and several classrooms with capacities ranging from 20 to 150 students. The building is equipped with state of the art electronic equipment such as laptops, projectors, tablet computers, medical equipment for health care and physiotherapy programmes such as massage beds, inflatable balls, skeleton models etc.  Career center  Alma Mater Europaea has a career center, which assists students with their employment. Employment rate of the Alma Mater Europaea graduates is the highest in the country.

Teaching and learning   International research and development programs  Some of the successful research projects include: * Slovene Jews in Prekmurje and ≈†tajerska: survival, remembering and revitalization (holder assistant professor Irena ≈†umi, Ph.D.) * Suffrage of persons with special needs ‚Äì Questions on regulation and improvement of implementation methods (holder assistant professor Jurij Toplak, Ph.D.) * Cross-border innovation network for value analysis for the endorsement of value analysis as an innovative tool for successfulness enhancement of Slovene and Austrian companies  Apple 1-1  The iPad one-to-one program uses technology that is already a big part of students‚Äô lives to make them more excited about learning. Recognizing that students get most of their information from the internet, AMEU wanted to adapt their teaching methods to an increasingly digital world, to help students better prepare for real life. By incorporating digital literacy standards into the curriculum, the goal was to create a teaching environment using the same technology that students were already using outside school. Because it was important to move away from traditional textbooks, AMEU chose the iPad as a learning tool because it gives students access to the world as it is today. Giving students access to iPad also allows teachers to better adapt to their students‚Äô unique needs and abilities. Students are no longer limited to writing essays and answering multiple-choice questions in order to demonstrate what they have learned.  Athletics  AMEU provides students with opportunities to participate in sporting events and has therefore formed several teams to compete in sports. As of now there is a football/soccer team, a volleyball team and basketball team all going by the name Team Alma Mater. The teams were formed in the study year 2014/2015 based on the initiative of the students and the student council. In the year 2016/2016 they elected the president of Team Alma Mater. The team competes in tournaments of footsal, volleyball and street basketball. Alma Mater Europaea also provides support for professional athletes competing in individual sports such as martial arts.

It was built to house engines hoisting ore from various Cleveland Mine locales, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. History View from southwest The Cleveland Mine was established in 1849, and was the second iron mine opened on the Marquette Iron Range after the Jackson Mine. The mine was one of the largest producers in the area from the 1850s through the 1880s, when it was headed by Samuel L. Mather. The first portion of the engine house was built in 1880-1882 and served as the mine's primary engine house. A hoisting plant consisting of two engines built by the Iron Bay Foundry of Marquette was installed in the building, and the equipment was used to haul ore from what was then known as the Incline Pit and the Sellwood (or Number 3) Pit. In 1884, the size of the building was doubled, and a four-engine hoist was installed. The iron ore mined by the Cleveland Mine company was depleted in the early 1890s. However, in 1891, the assets of the Cleveland Mining company were merged with that of other iron companies in the area, including the Jackson Mine and the Iron Cliffs Mine, to form the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company. Samuel L. Mather's son William G. Mather was president of the merged company. The Number 3 Engine House was converted to a storage facility.

The committee was formed in 1899 in response to the outbreak of the war, for the \\"dissemination of accurate information\\", and to seek an early \\"peaceable settlement between this country and the Boer Republics\\". The Conciliation Committee campaigned chiefly for formal negotiations to end the war. Among other movements, the Conciliation Committee was seen to be taking the centre ground, aiming to keep South Africa in the British Empire rather than pressing for the British to withdraw unilaterally, making non-partisan appeals to reason. Founded by Catherine Courtney, its president was the veteran politician Leonard Courtney. Courtney recruited Emily Hobhouse as secretary. Jane Cobden Unwin, daughter of the Radical and Liberal statesman Richard Cobden, was a founder member, as was the suffragist Elizabeth Maria Molteno, daughter of the first Cape Prime Minister, John Molteno.Marthinus van Bart: Songs of the Veld. Cape Town: Cederberg Publishers, 2008. Other prominent members included John Clifford, president of the Stop the War Committee,John Vickers, John Clifford , in A Dictionary of Methodism in Britain and Ireland, online at Spartacus Educational Allan Heywood Bright MP, Sir Wilfrid Lawson MP, publisher Thomas Fisher Unwin, left- wing journalist Henry Brailsford, and Robert Spence Watson, author of The History of English Rule and Policy in South Africa. There was a considerable overlap with the members of the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom. The 1900 general election was generally considered a \\"khaki election\\", and candidates such as Bright and Lawson, who were identified as \\"anti war\\", were heavily defeated. Against this background the Committee drew considerable public opposition to its campaigning, particularly when it organised a women's demonstration against the war in the same year. However, the antagonism was not as strong as that provoked by the Stop the War Committee, with its religiously inspired utopian approach. The Conciliation Committee's distinctive role was seen by The Spectator as providing authentic information about the war. Emily Hobhouse visited South Africa in 1900‚Äì1; her 1901 report on the British concentration camps led to the Fawcett Commission, which formally confirmed her findings. The South African branch of the Conciliation Committee was founded in Cape Town in early 1900, under the chairmanship of prominent parliamentarian John Molteno. It fought a long-running (though ultimately relatively successful) battle against state censorship and martial law.H.H. Hewison: Hedge of Wild Almonds. James Currey Publishers. 1989. p. 102.

It was part of the Allied administration of Libya. History British tanks and crews line up on Tripoli's waterfront after capturing the city during World War II - December 1942 In November 1942, the Allied forces retook Cyrenaica. By February 1943, the last German and Italian soldiers were driven from Libya and the Allied occupation of Libya began. Tripolitania 10-lire stamp of 1950 with face of King George VI Tripolitania and Cyrenaica remained under British administration, while the French controlled Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in Cairo but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal in 1947 of some aspects of foreign control. Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy, which hoped to maintain the colony of Tripolitania and France, which wanted the Fezzan, relinquished all claims to Libya. Libya so remained united. In June 1948, anti-Jewish rioters in Libya killed another 12 Jews and destroyed 280 Jewish homes.Shields, Jacqueline.\\"Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries\\" in Jewish Virtual Library. The fear and insecurity which arose from these anti-Jewish attacks and the founding of the state of Israel led many Jews to flee Libya.

Disposition of Italian colonial holdings was a question that had to be considered before the peace treaty officially ending the war with Italy could be completed. Technically, Libya remained an Italian possession administered by Britain and France, but at the Potsdam Conference in 1945 the Allies‚ÄîBritain, the Soviet Union, and the United States‚Äîagreed that the Italian colonies seized during the war should not be returned to Italy. Further consideration of the question was delegated to the Allied Council of Foreign Ministers, which included a French representative; although all council members initially favored some form of trusteeship, no formula could be devised for disposing of Libya. The United States suggested a trusteeship for the whole country under control of the United Nations (UN), whose charter had become effective in October 1945, to prepare it for self- government. The Soviet Union proposed separate provincial trusteeships, claiming Tripolitania for itself and assigning Fezzan to France and Cyrenaica to Britain. France, seeing no end to the discussions, advocated the return of the territory to Italy. To break the impasse, Britain finally recommended immediate independence for Libya.Library of Congress: United Nations and Libya In 1949, the Emirate of Cyrenaica was created and only Tripolitania remained under direct British military administration. A year later, in 1950, it was granted civil instead of military administration. Idris as-Senussi, the Emir of Cyrenaica and the leader of the Senussi Muslim Sufi order, represented Libya in the UN negotiations, and on 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence Independence In 1951, with representatives from Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan declaring a union and with the country being called the United Kingdom of Libya, Idris was offered the crown. In accordance with the constitution the new country had a federal government with the three states of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan having autonomy. The kingdom also had three capital cities: Tripoli, Benghazi and Bayda. Two years after independence, on 28 March 1953, Libya joined the Arab League. When Libya declared its independence it was the first country to achieve independence through the United Nations and one of the first former European possessions in Africa to gain independence.

BFHP is one of the largest homeless service providers in the East Bay.  History  The current Berkeley Food and Housing Project evolved from a small group of local churches providing emergency meal service to the transient youths who flooded the area during the Summer of Love in 1969. Initially, First Baptist Church of Berkeley under the leadership of Dr. Raymond P. Jennings began offering a meal service based out of their basement. University Lutheran Chapel and other local churches soon formed a partnership with First Baptist.http://articles.sfgate.com/2001-12-14/news/17631881_1_housing-project- women-s-shelter-rufus/4 In 1972, the meal service was renamed the Berkeley Emergency Lifeline. In 1984, the program was composed of several shelters operating out of Berkeley churches.http://bfhp.org/about/history In 1986, the programs were consolidated into a secular, incorporated organization called Berkeley Emergency Food Project. The City of Berkeley arranged to convert the basement of the downtown Veteran's Building into the Men's Overnight Shelter. In 1991 a women's shelter was founded at a building on Dwight Way, and in 1996 a Multi-Service Center opened on the ground floor of Trinity United Methodist Church. Another location, called Russell Street Residence, opened in 2002 as a California state-licensed board and care facility serving 17 men and women who were once homeless and are diagnosed with a mental disability.http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/08/20/after-40-years-berkeley- homeless-group-looks-ahead/ In 2013, BFHP received an award from the VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Familieshttps://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf/index.asp program, which allowed BFHP to start a program to help homeless veteran households in Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano Counties.https://bfhp.org/about/history/ In 2017 the program was renamed Roads Homehttps://bfhp.org/services/homeless-veteran-services/ and has since expanded into Sacramento, Amador, and San Joaquin Counties. Owing to structural issues at the Veteran's Building, in September 2018 the Men's Overnight Shelter and Veterans Transitional Program were moved into the same building as the women's shelter on Dwight Way, with the whole building now branded as the Dwight Way Center.  Services  The Community Meal (formerly known as the Quarter Meal) is the longest running free, weekday community meal program in the City of Berkeley. The meal is served four days a week and guests include those who are homeless and/or unemployed but also many who have housing and jobs and who depended on the program in order to free up income to cover other essentials like rent and utilities. In 2018 BFHP served 20,440 meals at the Community Meal, 18,615 meals at Russell Street Residence, 39,714 meals at both shelters. BFHP's Dwight Way Center in Berkeley accommodates two shelters. The women's shelter (in operation since 1992) and the men's shelter (launched in 1986), each have 32 beds. The Shelter offers those who are homeless a safe place to stay and support while they build income, skills, and seek permanent housing. The Shelter operates 365 days a year.https://bfhp.org/services/safety-net-services/ Beginning in 2019 BFHP has also run the CARE (Coordinated Assessment and Resource) & Warming Center in Concord which serves homeless individuals and families in Contra Costa County. The multi-purpose facility acts as a drop-in center during the day where people who are experiencing homelessness can access services. At night it becomes a low-barrier shelter for homeless individuals and families. The shelter can accommodate 30 people per night. The Contra Costa County CORE Outreach Team offers transportation to the shelter on a nightly basis. Russell Street Residence was established in 2002 and provides permanent supportive housing for 17 formerly homeless adults diagnosed with serious and persistent mental illness. Residents at Russell Street receive 24/7 care. Staff works with residents to develop independent living skills and assess those who might be ready to move into a more independent setting. BFHP's Shelter Plus Care is a HUD-funded program that provides permanent housing with tenancy support services.https://bfhp.org/services/permanent-supportive-housing/ Roads Home is a program of Berkeley Food & Housing Project that works to help end homelessness among veterans and their families. In 2010 BFHP opened a transitional housing program for homeless male veterans in downtown Berkeley. Four years later, the agency was selected as an SSVF grantee, which led to Roads Home becoming a program that provides an array of services to veterans and their families experiencing housing insecurity. Roads Home now includes five sites delivering services across six counties ‚Äì a territory comprising more than 1,600 square miles.https://bfhp.org/services/homeless-veteran- services/  References   External links  * Berkeley Food and Housing Project * EveryOne Home: Alameda County Category:Homelessness in the United States Category:Culture of Berkeley, California Category:Housing in California ","title":"Berkeley Food and Housing Project"},{"id":"32487087","text":"The Hamilton-Holly House, located at 4 St. Mark's Place in the East Village section of Manhattan, is a Federal style townhouse constructed in 1831. A designated landmark, it was the home of Eliza Hamilton, the widow of Alexander Hamilton, from 1833 to 1842. The Trash and Vaudeville fashion store was located there for over forty years ending in 2016. Building and initial development 19th-century appearance of St. Mark's Place townhouse The property was developed by Thomas E. Davis, a British-born real estate developer, who developed the entire block of St. Mark's Place (the name of East 8th Street in this area) between Third and Second Avenues. Davis built Federal style townhouses on both sides of the street. There are two other surviving townhouses from this development, at 25 St. Mark's Place and the best preserved of the three, the Daniel LeRoy House at 20 St. Mark's Place. The townhouse at 4 St. Mark's Place is wide and stories in height plus a basement level. The house is built of brick in a Flemish bond pattern with white marble at the basement level up till the beginning of the first floor, it has a high front stoop to the main entrance on the left which is characterized by the Baroque style Gibbs surround entrance with triple keystone and vermiculated blocks and long parlor-floor windows, molded pediment lintels and a peaked roof with two dormer windows. There was originally a semi-circular wrought iron balcony at the elevated first floor level. Around 1865‚Äì66, a nearly 53-foot two-story rear addition was built in the large rear yard, and a fire escape was installed on the front facade by the 1890s. Historical significance Sidney Augustus Holly, miniature portrait () For nine years, the townhouse at 4 St. Mark's Place was the home of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton (Eliza), widow of Alexander Hamilton, who was the first Secretary of the Treasury and one of the founding fathers of the United States. In November 1833, Eliza's son Col. Alexander Hamilton Jr. purchased the townhouse from Davis for $15,500. At the same time, Davis purchased The Grange (now the Hamilton Grange National Memorial) from Eliza, who was then 76 years old, for $25,000. The sale of the upper Manhattan home on 35 acres funded the Hamilton family's purchase of the townhouse. From 1833 to 1842, Eliza Hamilton lived there with two of her grown children and their spouses: her son Alexander and his wife Eliza Knox Hamilton, and her youngest daughter Eliza Hamilton Holly and her husband Sidney Augustus Holly. The building, now known as the Hamilton-Holly House, was designated as a landmark in October 2004 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Later uses and development In the 1870s and 1880s, the building was used as a rental meeting hall, and the upper two stories became apartments. Later, the street level and basement became a rental property occupied by a succession of commercial tenants. An auditorium in the basement level of the building became, in the 1950s and 1960s, the home of the Tempo Playhouse, which staged the American premieres of works by Jean Genet and Eug√®ne Ionesco. It was later used by the New Bowery Theater, which debuted a number of early underground films. For over forty years, from 1975 to February 2016, the first floor and basement were occupied by Trash and Vaudeville, a punk fashion store. The property was listed for sale in 2015, at a price of roughly $12 million. After the building's retail space and four apartments were vacated, it was purchased by an investment group in April 2016 for $10 million. Portions of a renovation plan were approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in November 2016, including approval for restoration of the fa√ßade, reconstruction of the grand curved balcony at the first floor, a new entryway, and rebuilding the interior space to provide additional residential units.

Christina Miller was deaf from childhood and also lost the sight of one eye in a laboratory explosion in 1930. The Christina Miller Building within Edinburgh University's Kings Buildings is named in her honour, as is Christina Miller Hall at Heriot-Watt University. Early life Christina Cruikshank Miller (Chrissie Miller) was born in 1899 in Coatbridge, Scotland to a stationmaster and was the eldest of two sisters. She suffered from measles and rubella at the age of five, causing her hearing to become damaged which became progressively worse throughout her life. Christina became interested in studying chemistry after reading a magazine article which showed industrial analytical chemistry as a potential career choice for women. Originally she had hopes to pursue a career in teaching but unfortunately her disabilities prevented this. Education Christina simultaneously studied on a three-year degree course at Edinburgh University (1917-1920) and a four-year diploma course at Heriot-Watt College (1917-1921), now Heriot-Watt University, which took the form of evening classes during the First World War, during this period she was one of only three women to get a diploma in chemistry. In 1920 she graduated from Edinburgh University with a Bsc with special distinction, won the class medal and was awarded the Vans Dunlop Scholarship which allowed her to undertake research for her PhD. She then went on to graduate from Heriot-Watt College in 1921. She approached Professor Sir James Walker in 1920 in the hopes of working under him at Edinburgh University and he instructed her to return in 1921 once she had learned German as much of the important literature of the time was written in German. In 1951 she was the only woman among the 25 first fellowes of Heriot-Watt University. Research Her PhD work was under the direction of Sir James Walker. She worked on verifying the Stokes-Einstein law for diffusion in solution. She studied how viscosity and temperature affected the diffusion of iodine in various solutions. The work was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. Post PhD, Miller changed topic to working on phosphorus trioxide. In 1928 she obtained the first ever sample of pure Phosphorus trioxide and showed the luminescence observed in previous samples was due to the presence of dissolved phosphorus. The paper was awarded the Keith Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The success of this work led to her achieving her ambition to obtain a DSc before the age of 30. She was described by a leading inorganic chemist of that time as the greatest advance in knowledge of the topic in the last 20 years. The research into phosphorus trioxide was curtailed following an explosion in which she lost the sight in one eye. Following this, Miller focused on developing techniques for Microanalysis. She focused on using these techniques to analyse rocks and metals. According to Ann Jones \\"Christina Miller was a true trailblazer. She made pioneering discoveries in analytical chemistry when this field was still very much a male preserve, and was an inspirational teacher and a mentor to generations of students.' In 1933 she was appointed director of the teaching laboratory and, through her commitment to innovation and new technology, strove to ensure that chemistry students received a thorough grounding in analytical chemistry. In 1949 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Her proposers were Sir James Pickering Kendall, Sir Edmund Hirst, John Edwin MacKenzie and J. Norman Davidson. She won the Society's Keith Medal for the period 1927-29.

The music style is sometimes labeled by some as fusion due to the wide range of styles that are played throughout the albums and even throughout the course of the same song. The band was originally formed by Pedro Calquinha (keyboard and guitar) and Andr√© Marques (bass guitar), although both play several other instruments on the band's albums, such as percussion, bouzouki, mandolin, flute and synthesizers. The band has so far released three studio albums: Bufus Dei (2010), Ablun Mal√ºss 108 (2011) and Drubahaal (2011). All albums were recorded, mixed and mastered by the band members themselves and are available for free at the band's blog. After the release of Drubahaal, the drummer Samuel Silva joined the band, being currently working in the composing and recording stage of the fourth album. Bufus Dei (2010) Bufus Dei is the first album of the band, and consisted in a mix of drums, electric guitar and electric bass almost exclusively. It is a concept album divided into 12 tracks, with the full length of 44 minutes and 22 seconds. The predominant musical genres in this album is funk, rock, jazz and metal.

The album was divided into 99 tracks, consisting in musical sentences and excerpts, and dense ambient created by the diverse orchestration used throughout the full length of the album (48 minutes and 57 seconds). Although some tracks contain lyrics and speeches, Ablun Mal√ºss 108 is an instrumental album, mixing musical genres such as funk, rock, folk, ethnic, jazz, tango, blues, and many others. Droban-Apherna also start to expand their orchestration in this album, using keyboards, various percussion, flutes, bouzouki, mandolin, kazoo, melodica and the usual bass, guitar and drums. Drubahaal (2011) Drubahaal is the third studio album by Droban-Apherna, released in late October 2011. The theme of video games is explored throughout the album, and the tracks are not united or \\"glued\\" like in the previous works. The full-length of Drubahaal is of 43 minutes and 52 seconds, divided into 12 tracks, and the orchestration used was mainly electric bass (fretted and fretless), electric keyboards, MIDI keyboards and drum sequencing, though there are certain bits of voices in track 9 and an electric guitar solo in track 7. This was also the first album where Droban-Apherna made videoclips. Using the videogame Minecraft, they used each track as a chapter of a movie based on the 2012 phenomenon.

The modest embellishments and its high level of preservation make it one of the most architecturally interesting examples of small, historic homes in Virginia. Architecture The house is very typical of early Chesapeake architecture. It is a 1-1/2 story brace- framed structure, clad in weatherboard siding that is largely original, with one wall of brick laid in Flemish bond. Its interior consists of a single chamber with a sleeping loft above. The dwelling is remarkably detailed and impeccably constructed. The owners were presumably slightly more well-off than their near neighbors, but still not wealthy enough to afford a larger, brick building. Distinctive features of the building include a pyramidal chimney and glazed brickwork. Although there used to be controversy surrounding the construction date, Dendrochronology and extensive study place the date between 1720 and 1750. The building underwent a number of alterations in the 19th and early 20th centuries. From the mid-1940s to the mid-1980s the house was little-used, sometimes housing migrant workers, but it was also used for storage, and as a chicken house for a time. Preservation Preservation Virginia purchased the property in 1986. They began extensive restoration work, including repairing the foundation, in 1994. The entire roof of the structure was replaced with cedar shingles, as called for by the Historic Structures Report, in 2004. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2013. On November 13, 2014 Preservation Virginia transferred ownership of Pear Valley to the newly formed Northampton Historic Preservation Society (formerly the 100-year-old Northampton Branch, PVA). The property is currently open to the public by appointment.

Pauly, Eds. Fundulus olivaceus. FishBase. 2011. It is native to the south-central United States, where it is known from the drainages of the Mississippi River from Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico and as far west as Galveston Bay. This species lives in clear streams with fast currents and sand or gravel substrates. It can often be found near the thick vegetation along the banks of the streams. It is omnivorous, consuming some plant matter along with a main diet of insects and other arthropods.  Description  The blackspotted topminnow has an elongate body up to 9.7 centimeters long. It is brownish yellow to olive green on its upper side and has a wide, dark lateral band and distinct dark spots. The male has longer fins than the female and the fins of the male may take on a yellowish color during breeding. This species is very similar to the blackstripe topminnow (Fundulus notatus), which also has a dark lateral band. It can be distinguished from F. notatus by its darker, more numerous spots. The two may hybridize.Hendrickson, D. A. and A. E. Cohen. Fundulus olivaceus. Fishes of Texas Project and Online Database (www.fishesoftexas.org). Published by Texas Natural History Collection, a division of Texas Natural Science Center, University of Texas at Austin. 2012. In Fundulus olivaceus, the gill slit extends the dorsal to the uppermost pectoral fin ray. The distance from the origin of the dorsal fin to the end of the hypural plate is less than the distance from the origin of the dorsal fin to the preopercle or occasionally about equal to that distance.Hubbs, C., R.

On occasion, large males have been observed keeping an open territory of three square meters, Males seldom tolerate females in the wild, except during morning or evening spawning activities. In the aquarium, however, thus fish loses its wild traits, and becomes less aggressive. When spawning approaches, though, the males start to reveal their wild, aggressive traits. The males will approach each other head-on, and exhibit flaring opercula and gular areas-very similar to cichlid or betta behavior. They will then begin to slap and bite each other's flanks until one backs down. Ripe eggs are an average of 2.14 mm in diameter. The outer egg membrane has filaments that tend to be restricted to one area forming a tuft. The eggs hatch in 10‚Äì14 days and live for about 3 years  Distribution  Range of the blackspotted topminnow includes the Gulf Slope, from Galveston Bay drainage, Texas, east to Choctawhatchee River system, Florida, and middle Chattahoochee River drainage, Georgia; Mississippi River basin from the Gulf to southeastern Kansas,Holcroft, N.

She was licensed to practice medicine in Iowa (1873), Illinois (1876), Pennsylvania (1880) and New York (1890). Cleaves lectured and had clinical practice in London, Paris, Leipzig, Berlin and New York. From 1873-6, Cleaves worked as an assistant physician at the State Hospital for the Insane, Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. Cleaves was the first woman physician to regularly treat mental illness at that institution, she subsequently served as a member of the board of trustees. From 1880-3, Cleaves was physician-in-chief of the Women's Department, State Hospital for the Insane, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In 1885, Cleaves was appointed to the University of Iowa Medical Department's examining committee, \\"perhaps the first woman to serve in that capacity in the United States.\\"Classics in Brachytherapy, Margaret Cleaves Introduces Gynecologic Brachytherapy, by Jesse N. Aronowitz, Shoshana V. Aronowitz, Roger F. Robinson (No. 6 2007 p 293-297) In 1895, Cleaves founded the New York Electro- Therapeutic Clinic, Laboratory and Dispensary in New York City. Her work there included the treatment of a large number of cases of neurasthenia among both male and female patients.Margaret A. Cleaves, \\"Franklinization as a Therapeutic Measure in Neurasthenia,\\" Journal of the American Medical Association 27 (1896): 1049-052. Cleaves was a prolific author on topics concerning the use of radiation and electricity to treat illnesses. Cleaves also invented a variety of instruments for such treatments. Having an interest in the welfare and advancement of women, She organized the Des Moines Woman's Club and served as its first president. Early years and education Margaret Abigail Cleaves was born in Columbus City, Iowa, November 25, 1848. Her father was of Dutch and English, and her mother of Scotch and Irish ancestry, but by birth, they were both Americans. Her father, Dr. John Trow Cleaves, was born in Yarmouth, Maine, in 1813, and her mother, Elizabeth Stronach, in Baltimore, in 1820. In 1843, they were married in Columbus City, where Dr. Cleaves practiced medicine until his death in October 1863. He was a man who took an interest in public affairs, and he was twice elected to the Iowa State Legislature, first in 1852, and again in 1861. Cleaves was the third of seven children. She inherited her father's taste for medical pursuits and, as a child accompanied him on his visits. Her education was obtained in the public schools and in the Iowa State University, but because of limited means, she was unable to finish the collegiate course in the latter institution. After she was sixteen, she alternately attended and taught school for some years. In 1868, the family moved to Davenport, Iowa. There, Cldaves resolved to become a doctor instead of continuing a school teacher. Her choice of a profession was not regarded with favor by the various members of her family, who entertained the prevailing ideas concerning the limitations of woman's sphere, but her mind was made up, and in 1870, she began to read medicine and, against their wishes, entered the Medical Department of the Iowa State University. In 1871, she entered the office of her preceptor, Dr. W. F. Peck, who was dean of the faculty and professor of surgery in the university. She was graduated March 5, 1873, standing at the head of the class. Career Physician Margaret Cleaves Shortly after graduating, Cleaves was appointed second assistant physician in the State Hospital for the Insane, Mount Pleasant, Iowa. There, she was a veritable pioneer, for up to that time, only one other woman in the world had occupied the position of physician in a public insane asylum. She remained in the asylum for three years and then resigned her position to commence private practice in Davenport, She was subsequently appointed one of the trustees of the asylum. While practicing medicine in Davenport, she became a member of the Scott County Medical Society, being the second woman to gain admission to that body. For several years, she was the secretary of the society. She also joined the State Medical Society, where she was again the second woman to gain admission. She was the first woman to become a member of the Iowa and Illinois Central District Medical Association. During her residence in Davenport she was an active member of the Davenport Academy of Sciences. In 1879, the board of trustees of the State Asylum for the Insane chose her their delegate to the National Conference of Charities, which that year met in Chicago, Illinois. In that conference, she read a paper on \\"The Medical and Moral Care of Female Patients in Hospitals for the Insane.\\" It attracted widespread attention, and was printed in a volume, Lunacy in Many Lands, which was published by the Government of New South Wales. In June 1880, she was appointed by the Governor of Iowa a Slate delegate to the National Conference of Charities in Cleveland, Ohio, and thus the distinction was conferred upon her of being the first female delegate from Iowa to that body. She reported for the State to the conference, and her report was subsequently incorporated in the Governor's annual message. That same year she was appointed physician-in-chief in the Female Department of the Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital in Harrisburg. After three years of hard work, rendered all the more arduous by her conscientious devotion to the minutest details of her duties, Cleaves was compelled by failing health to resign her position. She went abroad in 18S3, remaining nearly two years, visiting insane hospitals in Scotland, England, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Belgium, everywhere receiving courtesies from men of recognized eminence in the treatment of insanity. She witnessed operations in general hospitals in England, France, and Germany, and in Paris, she was for several months a regular attendant at lectures and clinics. After returning to the United States, she opened a private home for the reception of patients in Des Moines, Iowa, conducting also an office practice in connection with her other work. In March 1885, she was appointed one of the examining committee of the Medical Department of the Iowa State University. It was the first honor of that kind bestowed on a woman by any standard medical school in the United States. In July 1886, she was sent as a delegate to the yearly meeting of the National Conference of Charities, which was held in St. Paul, Minnesota. During her residence in Des Moines, she was an active member of the Polk County Medical Society, of the Missouri Valley Medical Association and of the Iowa State Medical Association. Before all those bodies she read papers and she served the last-named body as chairman of obstetrics and gynaecology in the session of 1889. At that time she was the only woman who had received such an appointment. Activist and writer Illustration from Light energy, its physics, physiological action and therapeutic applications (1904) Her work was not confined to medicine alone. She took a deep interest in all that pertained to the welfare and advancement of women. She organized the Des Moines Woman's Club and was its first president. Some time prior to that, she had become a member of the Association for the Advancement of Women. Becoming interested in the subject of electro-therapeutics, she went to New York in the winter of 1887 and to Paris in the following summer, to prosecute her inquiries and investigation. After her return, she continued to practice for a while in Des Moines, but in 1890, she retired from that field and went to New York City, where she opened an office. She there joined the Medical Society of the County of New York, the American Electro-Therapeutic Association and the New York Women's Press Club. In the Post-Graduate Medical School, New York, she served as clinical assistant to the chair of electro-therapeutics. Since she took up her residence in New York, she read papers before the Medical Society of Kings County, Brooklyn, the New York Medico-Legal Society, the American Electro- Therapeutic Association and the National Conference of Charities. Many of them were published, and all of them were distinguished by painstaking research, clearness of statement, and logical reasoning. She was author of Light Energy: Its Physics, Physiological Action and Therapeutic Application, and American editor of the Journal of Physiological Therapeutics, London. Cleaves died in a hospital in Mobile, Alabama, November 7, 1917.

Description Distribution The southern studfish has its historical distribution in the upland tributaries of the Alabama River in Alabama (except the Tallapoosa River system); in northern Georgia, in a few of the headwater tributaries of the Chattahoochee River; in the upper Chattahoochee River drainages in northern Alabama and southeastern Tennessee; and the Tennessee and Cumberland River drainages in eastern Tennessee. Currently, the studfish still occupies all the historical distribution areas and seems to be holding a sustainable population in comparison to the northern studfish (Fundulus catenatus), which is seemingly being replaced in these areas. The decrease in some small areas, although not significant, as in Alabama, and the failure to collect additional specimens from previous samples may indicate this species has been extirpated from the Cahaba River system. The southern studfish is also thought to be replaced in the Tallapoosa River system by the stippled studfish (Fundulus bifax). The cause of this decline is the increase in road runoff into these waterways and competition for food and breeding areas. Prey and predators The southern studfish's larger crushing teeth are correlated with its diet of 80% mollusks and crustaceans, although the younger specimens collected also contained small insects and invertebrates. The development of their teeth is a key factor in the diet of the species; as an individual matures, it will go through an ontogenetic shift in diet. The amount of food consumed is greatest in the months preceding and during spawning, and lowest during fall and early winter. This species' direct competitors are other top minnows and killifish also native to these areas, such as the central stoneroller (Campostoma anomalum), the coosa darter (Etheostoma coosae), and the trispot darter (Etheostoma trisella). The predators of this species are in the families Centrarchidae (in particular, the genus Micropterus) and Percidae. Some abiotic factors that may affect this species is that they are very limited in geographic distributions and/or in characteristics of their environments, especially with respect to water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and salinity. Ambient temperature is often thought of as the key abiotic condition influencing the distribution and abundance of aquatic organisms, increasing the areas needed for laying eggs. This is due to its pervasive increase of chemical activity. However, both ambient temperature and salinity are key factors in the success of this species because of their effects on distributions of aquatic organisms. Some human influenced abiotic induced factors are caused by the alteration of road crossings and urbanization of runoff areas. This factor effects both the structure of the aquatic habitat but also the biology of this habitat. Life history This species prefers margins, pools, and backwaters of creeks and small rivers, with moderate to high gradients, a permanent flow of clear water, and the bottom usually consisting of sand, gravel, rock, and occasionally an admixture of silt. F. stellifer is most commonly found in shallow, sandy backwaters near clear creeks with gravel bottoms. Males establish and defend small territories in shallow, quiet-water spawning areas. Spawning occurs between late April and early June. This species does not migrate or prepare a nest. Sexual maturity is reached in the second full spawning season for both sexes, with females having a maximum ovum diameter of 2.75 mm. The average size of this species is 8.01 cm. Maximum age appears to be just over two years for both sexes, as the oldest specimens collected were estimated at 28 months of age. Although this species is not migratory, its distribution is affected by the alterations of road crossings mentioned by a study done in north Georgia on the Etowah Basin streams. These alterations affect the structure of these aquatic ecosystems, changing how these species travel, eat, and spawn. Management One major management effort to protect the southern studfish and other killifish and top water minnows, located in Alabama, focuses on the watershed features and current biological and habitat conditions of Hatchet Creek. This management effort was established by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management with the support of the Geological Survey of Alabama. The focus of this effort is to research and develop strategies of future management based on water quality variation, stream hydrology, watershed features, land-use patterns, and biological conditions.

On 25 February, most of eastern Libya was reported to be under the control of protesters and rebel forces. Gaddafi remained in control of the cities of Tripoli, Sirte and Sabha. By 15 March, however, Gaddafi's forces had retaken more than half a dozen lost cities. Except for most of Cyrenaica and a few Tripolitania cities (such as Misrata) the majority of cities had returned to Gaddafi government control. On 17 March, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution which authorized member states \\"to take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamhariya, including Benghazi, while excluding an occupation force\\". This began a new phase in the conflict. Early phase (15‚Äì26 February) 4 February *Al Jazeera reported as early as 4 February that calls for a day of protest on 17 February had been circulating on the internet. 15 February *In the evening approximately 200 people began demonstrating in front of the police headquarters in Benghazi following the arrest of human rights activist Fathi Terbil. They were later joined by others, totaling between 500 and 600 protesters. The protest was broken up violently by police, causing as many as forty injuries among the protesters. *In Bayda and Zintan, hundreds of protesters called for \\"the end of the regime\\" and set fire to police and security buildings. In Zintan, the protesters set up tents in the town centre. 16 February *Protests continued in Benghazi, where hundreds of protesters gathered at Maydan al- Shajara before security services tried to disperse the crowd using water cannons. After clashes between the two groups, the police left. The protesters set fire to two cars and burnt down the headquarters of the traffic police. In the ensuing clashes with police six people died and three were injured. In Al- Quba, more than 400 protesters over a wide range of ages set fire to the police station. Protests were also reported in Derna and Zintan, though there were no injuries. *Pro-government rallies of many dozens of Gaddafi supporters and Tripolitanian people also took place. *Reportedly as a response to the demonstrations, Libya released 110 members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group from prison on 16 February. 17 February: Day of Revolt *Libyans called for a \\"Day of Revolt.\\" The National Conference for the Libyan Opposition stated that \\"all\\" groups opposed to Gaddafi both within Libya and in exile planned the protests in memory of the demonstrations in Benghazi on 17 February 2006 that were initially against the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, but which turned into protests against Gaddafi. *In Benghazi, the government released thirty prisoners from jail, armed them and paid them to fight against protesters. Demonstrators claimed at the time that several people were killed by snipers and gunfire from helicopters, a claim that Amnesty International says that there is no evidence for. The Evening Standard and Al Jazeera estimated that fourteen people were killed. The latter reported that an eyewitness saw six unarmed protesters shot dead by police. The BBC News reported that \\"at least 15 people\\" were killed in the clashes. *Libya al- Youm (ŸäŸàŸÖ) reported that four people were shot dead by sniper fire in Bayda and a Libyan human-rights group reported thirteen people had been killed. In Ajdabiya and Derna at least ten and six protesters were killed by police, respectively. Protests also took place across Tripoli and in Zintan, where a number of government buildings including a police station were set on fire. 18 February *Thousands of anti-government protesters gathered in front of the Benghazi courthouse. According to the BBC News, a \\"doctor at Benghazi's Jalla hospital\\" told them that he had \\"seen 15 bodies ‚Äì all dead from gunshot wounds\\" by the time he left the hospital \\"in the early hours of [the day]\\". Police and army personnel later withdrew from the city after being overwhelmed by protesters. Some army personnel also joined the protesters; they then seized the local radio station. In Bayda, unconfirmed reports indicated that the local police force and riot-control units joined the protesters. Two police officers who were accused of shooting protesters were hanged by protesters. *According to a local activist, protesters in Bayda succeeded in capturing its military airbase, and then \\"executed 50 African mercenaries and two Libyan conspirators\\". He also claimed that other \\"conspirators were executed\\" in Derna by burning down a police station, where they were locked up in cells. *The Libyan newspaper Quryna reported that about 1,000 non-political prisoners had escaped from a Benghazi prison. A security source told Agence France-Presse that four inmates were shot dead during a breakout attempt in Tripoli. *The Libyan government initially restricted access to the Internet in Libya for several hours, but later imposed a more comprehensive and sustained blackout. 19 February Opposition protests outside the White House, Washington, D.C., on 19 February *Widespread protests continued for another day. Demonstrators in Benghazi had reportedly taken control of Benina International Airport early in the day. *The opposition warned civilians of a massacre by the government, unless the international community applied pressure. Witnesses in Libya have reported helicopters firing into crowds of anti-government protesters. The army withdrew from the city of Bayda. Human Rights Watch and the Libyan newspaper Quryna said thousands of demonstrators had poured out onto the streets in Benghazi and other eastern cities on 18 February, a day after the clashes in which 49 people were killed, and that some protests were still continuing. Artillery, helicopter gunships and antiaircraft missile launchers were used to kill protesters. Security forces reportedly opened fire at a funeral for dead protesters in Benghazi, killing at least fifteen people and injuring scores more. *A doctor from Benghazi's Al-Jalah Hospital said staff there had received fifteen bodies and were treating numerous people following the shootings at the funeral. \\"This is not a well-equipped hospital and these injuries come in waves,\\" he said. \\"All are very serious injuries, involving the head, the chest and the abdomen. They are bullet injuries from high-velocity rifles.\\" The hospital counted forty-four deaths in three days, and was struggling to treat the wounded. The residents of Benghazi told Al Jazeera that at least 200 people had died, while the Human Rights Watch put the countrywide death toll at a \\"conservative\\" 104 on 19 February. *Anti-Gaddafi protests were also reported in Misrata, where thousands of people took part in peaceful protests. They were demonstrating against state brutality and censorship, rather than calling for a change in government. *Both pro- and anti-government protests broke out in other major cities, including Bayda, Derna, Tobruk and Misrata. *Several hundred government supporters and party activists took to the streets in large numbers, and security forces prevented large demonstrations against Gaddafi's government. *According to figures compiled by Agence France-Presse from local sources, at least forty-one people had been killed since demonstrations first started on 15 February. The toll excludes two policemen, newspapers said, who had been hung in Bayda on 18 February. Human Rights Watch, citing phone interviews with hospital staff and eyewitnesses, said that security forces had killed more than eighty anti-Gaddafi protesters in eastern Libya. Opposition groups later put the number of dead at over 120. The residents of Benghazi told Al Jazeera that at least 200 people had died while Human Rights Watch put the countrywide death toll at a \\"conservative\\" 104. The security forces of Benghazi were in their barracks while the city was in a state of civil mutiny. *Mohamed Abdulmalek, the chairman of the human rights group Libya Watch, commented that the delay of protests in the west was due to the heavy presence of Libya's State Security Forces and secret police were out there and \\"not because the people did not want to go out\\". *Former UK Foreign Secretary and Chairman of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC News that the protests across the Middle East were resembling the anti-Communist/pro-democracy events in Eastern Europe of 1989. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was \\"deeply concerned\\" by the \\"unacceptable violence\\" used against protesters. 20 February *Protests escalated with residents also reporting small protests beginning in Tripoli, indicating a widening of the unrest from the eastern half of Libya into Gaddafi's center of power. Hospitals confirmed that they had run out of supplies and doctors estimated the death toll in Benghazi to be between 200 and 300. After the people of Benghazi beat back the police and captured several key military barracks local military brigades joined the protesters. By this time, protesters in Benghazi numbered in the tens of thousands, possibly in the hundreds of thousands. Reports also emerged of pro-Gaddafi militia by the Elfedeel Bu Omar compound \\"being butchered by angry mobs.\\" Al Jazeera said that protesters were in control of the city as government security forces fled to the airport. Further military units were reported to have defected in order to protect protesters. Several senior Muslim clerics and tribal leaders from around Libya called for an end to the bloodshed by the government, and for the government to step down. A \\"spontaneous\\" protest occurred in Tripoli by night where the protesters quickly overran police. One tribal leader threatened to block oil exports. *The Tuareg tribe in the south was said to have answered a call by the larger Warfalla tribe to take part in the protests. The Tuareg towns of Ghat and Ubari were also locations for violence, with members of the tribe reportedly attacking government buildings and police stations. *Gaddafi's second son Saif al-Islam appeared on state television and said that the unrest \\"may cause civil war\\". He also said that Libya was different from its neighbours. He ended by warning, \\"We will fight to the last man and woman and bullet. We will not lose Libya. We will not let Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and BBC trick us\\". State-run Al-Shababiya was reportedly attacked in the evening following Saif al Islam's address. *The United States Department of State, through the American Embassy, issued a travel warning to US citizens due to the continuing unrest in Libya. The European Union called on the government to refrain from using force and to answer the protesters' grievances. *In the night, clashes escalated in Tripoli, with protesters trying to seize control of Green Square. Witnesses reported snipers firing into the crowds, and Gaddafi supporters driving around the square shooting and running demonstrators over. Protesters burned a police and security forces' station and the General People's Congress' building. Hospital mortuaries in Tripoli were reportedly overrun with bodies many having gunshot wounds to the head and chest. It is estimated that 600 to 700 people were killed. 21 February *Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi called for a \\"general assembly\\" to discuss grievances.Al Jazeera. Breaking News. Representatives of the Libyan Community in Ireland demonstrating in Dublin, Ireland, against Gaddafi on 21 February 2011. *In Benghazi, protesters took control of the streets, looted weapons from the main security headquarters and seized the local radio station, starting their own broadcasts under the name Voice of Free Libya. Demonstrators also lowered the Libyan flag from above the main courthouse and replaced it with the flag of Libya's old monarchy. Libyan Air Force warplanes and attack helicopters launched airstrikes on protesters, reportedly targeting a funeral procession and a group of protesters trying to reach a military base. Two senior mutineering air force pilots flew their Dassault Mirage F1 fighter jets to Malta and requested political asylum after defying orders to bomb protesters. Two civilian helicopters also landed in Malta, carrying seven passengers who claimed to be French oil workers. *Reports indicated the People's Hall in Tripoli, which serves as the meeting place for the General People's Congress, had been set on fire. There were also reports that the state-television building had been smashed up by protesters and that at least one Tripoli police station was burned down. Libyan Navy warships were reported to have begun bombardment of residential areas causing an unknown number of casualties. Banks and other government buildings were looted throughout the day. Demonstrators clashed with security forces, and heavy gunfire was heard throughout the city. At least sixty-one people were killed. *Some people alleged that they were offered money to turn up for pro-Gaddafi rallies outside Libya. Within Libya, state-run television showed pro-Gaddafi rallies, though the international media doubted the authenticity of these protests as possibly having been staged. *The Libyan Navy reportedly shelled demonstrators from the sea, and Gaddafi allegedly issued execution orders to soldiers refusing to fire on protesters. *UK Foreign Secretary Hague said that he had received information that Gaddafi had left Libya and was travelling to Venezuela. Venezuelan government officials denied reports that Gaddafi had left Libya and was on a plane bound for Caracas. It was later reported that one of Gaddafi's sons arrived on Isla Margarita, Venezuela, around the time that Hague made his allegation. *The BBC News reported that the Libyan Army was \\"fighting forces loyal to Colonel Gaddafi, who appears to be struggling to hold on to power.\\" A group of army officers also called upon their fellow soldiers to \\"join the people\\" and remove Gaddafi from office. Islamic leaders and clerics in Libya urged all Muslims to rebel against Gaddafi. The Libyan Ambassador to Poland stated that the flood of defections by elements of the Army and Air Force, as well as by government ministers, could not be stopped and that Gaddafi's days in power were numbered. He also said that firing on the protesters was only increasing the unrest and that it was the sign of a dying government. The Libyan Ambassadors to Indonesia, Bangladesh, the European Union and India also resigned in protest of the actions of the Gaddafi government. *Protesters seized control of the oil town of Ra's Lanuf and workers set up committees to protect the oil installations. *Activists claimed that protesters surrounded Gaddafi's Bab al-Aziza compound and were trying to storm it, but were forced back by heavy gunfire that killed up to 80 people. 22 February *Gaddafi made a brief appearance on Libyan state television in which he said he had been speaking to the youth in Tripoli's Green Square. He also said: Gunfire was reportedly heard throughout the night of 21‚Äì22 February. Government soldiers were reported to have continued some bombarding to keep defecting soldiers away from the protests. Fighter jets were reported to have targeted army ammunition depots in order to prevent troops from joining the protesters. *A Libyan naval vessel was reportedly sighted off the coast of Malta. According to Al Jazeera, five Italian fighter jets overflew the ship, and the Italian Navy began conducting surveillance. The ship reportedly had its flag lowered, suggesting that the crew may want to defect. The Armed Forces of Malta several times denied reports in the international media that it was monitoring any such vessels approaching Maltese shores. *Former Libyan Ambassador to India Ali Abd-al-Aziz al-Isawi, stated that he feared returning to Libya. He also confirmed that fighter jets were used to bomb civilians, and that foreign mercenaries, who seemed to have come from other African states, were \\"massacring\\" people. *Former Libyan Ambassador to Bangladesh A. H. Elimam, was also reported to have \\"disappeared\\" after 9:00 Bangladesh time. Al Jazeera said the last conversation with him noted \\"a sense of panic\\" in his voice and that his phone had been switched off. He indicated a feeling of being threatened by an intelligence officer at the embassy, who was from the same village as Gaddafi. The Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry and other diplomats in that state could not confirm his whereabouts. *A doctor in Tripoli told Asharq Al-Awsat that mercenaries broke into his hospital and killed injured people. *Former UK Foreign Secretary David Owen said that a \\"military intervention\\" via a no-fly zone was immediately necessary. The Austrian Army reported that the airspace around Tripoli had been closed, but later retracted the statement. An Austrian Defense Ministry spokesman, Michael Huber, said: \\"One of our sources said that initially that it (airspace) was closed, but then another later confirmed otherwise. Our plane was able to leave.\\" *Eyewitnesses reported that thousands of African mercenaries were flown into Tripoli to put down the uprising. One insider source reportedly said that Gaddafi now could only rely on his own clan and 5,000 men, out of 45,000, and knew he could not retake Libya. According to this source, he apparently planned to force a Pyrrhic victory on his opponents; to whittle down their numbers with many skirmishes, harm the economy by sabotaging oil reserves, and in every sense damaging infrastructure to the best of his ability, stating \\"I have the money and arms to fight for a long time\\". Oil infrastructures may be sabotaged to cut economic supply to rebel clans, while fights may lead thousands to flee Libya to pressure them. Thus, all may prefer to accept the Gaddafi's status quo. *In a second speech within twenty-four hours, believed by commentators to be made from his family compound in the Bab al-Azizia military barracks in southern Tripoli, Gaddafi blamed foreign powers and hallucinogens being forced on the protesters for the unrest. He rejected stepping down, saying he had no official position from which he could step down, and stated that he would \\"die as martyr\\". The scenery of the speech indicated that Gaddafi was in Libya. *In his hour-long speech, he blamed the uprising on \\"Islamists\\", and then warned that an \\"Islamic emirate\\" has already been set up in Bayda and Derna, where he threatened the use of extreme force and genocide-like tactics, to stop the Islamfication of Libya. Gaddafi vowed to fight on and die a \\"martyr\\" on Libyan soil. He then called on his supporters to take back the streets on the 23rd from protesters and tribal rebels, who were demanding that he step down. He also went on to state that he had \\"not yet ordered the use of force\\", and warned viewers that \\"when I do, everything will burn\\". *Gaddafi vowed to fight his opponents \\"until the last drop of his blood had been spilt\\" rather than step down, describing anti-government protesters as \\"rats\\" and \\"mercenaries\\" working for foreign states and corporate agendas. Gaddafi said the rioting urban youths that were opposed to his rule were manipulated by others who gave them drugs and who were trying to turn Libya into an Islamic state. (In earlier speeches he blamed \\"Zionists\\" for the riots.) Furthermore, he threatened a Tiananmen-style crackdown. The speech would later be parodied in a viral YouTube video entitled Zenga Zenga. *Abdul Fatah Younis, who held the position of top general and interior minister, escaped from house arrest, resigned, and called for the army and police to fight Gaddafi and his government. Until his resignation, General Younis was regarded as the second most powerful man in Libya. *Human Rights Watch said that at least 233 people had been killed up to 22 February. *By nighttime, the Arab League had suspended the Libyan delegation from meetings until the Libyan people were safe. 23 February A young Libyan carrying King Idris's photograph during a protest in Benghazi on 23 February 2011. *UK Foreign Secretary Hague said in a press release that there were \\"many indications of the structure of the State collapsing in Libya\\". He also urged the Libyan state to listen to people's demands. Luxembourger Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn called the situation in Libya a genocide and called for massive intervention from the international community. He argued a resolution was needed allowing control of Libyan airspace so as to stop mercenaries entering Libya. He called Gaddafi a \\"sick and dangerous\\" \\"tyrant\\". *Peru fully severed diplomatic ties with Libya's government and the African Union conducted a security meeting on the rapidly changing situation in Libya. The European Union agreed in principle to impose sanctions, the form of which to be decided the following Friday, and the Dutch government met in emergency session to consider freezing billions of euros of assets invested by Tamoil, the Libyan government's oil company. *The Warfalla, the largest of the numerous tribes in Libya, joined calls from other tribes for Gaddafi to stand down. *Mustafa Abdul Jalil, Libya's justice minister, who had resigned on 21 February in protest at the \\"excessive use of violence\\" against protesters along with diplomats at the Libyan Mission to the United Nations, who called on the Libyan Army to help remove \\"the tyrant Muammar Gaddafi\\". He had also asserted that Gaddafi personally ordered the Lockerbie bombing of 1988. *Youssef Sawani, a senior aide to Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, resigned from his post \\"to express dismay against violence\\" and thousands of foreigners continue to leave, with chaos at Tripoli International Airport. *Tripoli's streets were deserted after Gaddafi urged attacks on protesters, but Tobruk was still full of protesters. Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said there were credible reports that about 1,000 people have been killed in Libya's week-old rebellion. Frattini also confirmed that the eastern half of Libya, known as Cyrenaica, was no longer under Gaddafi's de facto control. Unconfirmed reports suggested that the government now only controlled a few parts of Tripoli and the southern desert town of Sabha. Misrata was confirmed to be under protester control. The pre- Gaddafi 1951‚Äì1969 royalist Libyan flag was also reportedly raised in Zawiya, west of Tripoli. Both coastal Tripolitania and most of northern Cyrenaica were in rebel hands by the middle of the day. The Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights said that the anti-Gaddafi protesters also controlled Sirte, Misrata, Khoms, the Tarhunah District, Zintan, Zawiya and Zuwara. Pro-Gaddafi forces were sent to Sabratha after demonstrators burned government buildings and joined in the rebellion, according to Libyan newspaper Quryna. *A 23 February Reuters article stated that according to a WikiLeaks-leaked US cable, Gaddafi pressed the US to foster division and disagreements in Saudi Arabia and exerted heavy pressure on the US as well as on oil companies to reimburse the $1.5 billion Libya had paid in 2008 into a fund to settle terrorism claims from the 1980s. *By the end of the day, headlines in online news services were reporting a range of themes underlining the precarious state of the regime ‚Äì former justice minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil alleged that Gaddafi personally ordered the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, ‚Äì citing an original interview with Expressen in Sweden: (English translation (via Google Translate).) resignations and \\"defections\\" of close allies, the loss of Benghazi, the second-largest city in Libya, reported to be \\"alive with celebration\\" and other cities including Tobruk and Misrata reportedly falling with some believing that government had retained control of \\"just a few pockets\\", Gaddafi family members allegedly refused entry to safe jurisdictions (an unscheduled plane said to be carrying Gaddafi's daughter Aisha was denied permission to enter Malta, although the Maltese government later denied knowing whether she was on board), mounting international isolation and pressure, and reports that Middle East media considered the end of his \\"disintegrating\\" regime all but inevitable. *Around midnight, some reports began to emerge describing the situation as civil war or revolution, with Gaddafi trying to ensure control over the capital and his political base Tripoli. 24 February *Protesters assumed complete control of Tobruk, where soldiers and residents celebrated by waving the former Libyan flag used during the Kingdom of Libya (1951‚Äì1969), firing guns into the air and honking horns. Army units in Tobruk and throughout eastern Libya sided with protesters, with some soldiers and officers participating in demonstrations. Commanders pledged to defend the \\"liberated territory\\" with their lives after Gaddafi threatened to take it back by force. Two airmen bailed out of their jet, which crashed into the desert, after defying orders to bomb Tobruk. In the collapse of central authority, residents formed public-defence committees for security, and opened welfare organisations to ensure that residents had enough to eat. At newly established security checkpoints, demonstrators handed out bottled water and juice to passing motorists. *Cities and towns close to Tripoli were reported to be falling to protesters, while in Tripoli itself, pro-Gaddafi militia patrolled the streets to prevent demonstrations. In the east, civilian protesters and military units that had defected and reorganized armed themselves to prepare for an upcoming \\"Battle of Tripoli\\". Meanwhile, Gaddafi prepared for the defense of the city by gathering pro-government forces in the capital and deploying tanks in the suburbs. *The North African wing of al-Qaeda announced that they would support the Libyan uprising. In a televised phone call to the people of Zawiya, where fighting was taking place, Gaddafi claimed the revolts could be blamed on Osama bin Laden, and that young Libyans had been duped with drugs and alcohol.Staff (24 February 2011). \\"Libya Protests: Gaddafi Says Bin Laden To Blame\\". BBC News. Retrieved 30 March 2011. Gaddafi dispatched an envoy to Zawiya, who warned protesters of a \\"massacre\\" if they did not leave. *Pro-Gaddafi Libyan forces and foreign mercenaries opened fire on a mosque in Zawiya, where residents, some armed with hunting rifles, had been holding a sit-in to support the protesters in Tripoli. The troops blasted the mosque's minaret with an anti-aircraft gun, killing 10 people and wounding 150. Thousands of people then gathered in Zawiya's main square to demonstrate against Gaddafi. Hours after the attack, Gaddafi gave a speech on state television, where he expressed condolences for the deaths, but scolded the city's residents for siding with the uprising, saying \\"shame on you, people of Zawiya, control your children\\", and that \\"they are loyal to Bin Laden. What do you have to do with Bin Laden, people of Zawiya? They are exploiting young people... I insist it is Bin Laden\\". He also blamed teenagers on hallucinogenic pills given to them \\"in their coffee with milk, like Nescaf√©\\".https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-protests-gaddafi- idUSTRE71N4NI20110224 *Pro-Gaddafi militia and foreign mercenaries also attacked an airport outside Misrata, which was defended by protesters armed with rifles, in what would become the Battle of Misrata. During the fighting, the militia bombarded the protesters with rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, while the protesters managed to seize an anti-aircraft gun and turn it against the militia. At the same time, officers from an air-force school near the airport mutinied, and with the help of local residents, overran an adjacent airbase where Gaddafi supporters were holed up, and disabled fighter jets to prevent their use against protesters. Five people were killed during the fighting: four protesters and one pro-Gaddafi militiaman, and another forty wounded. *In Tripoli, militia and foreign mercenaries continued patrolling the streets, firing guns into the air, while neighbourhood-watch groups barricaded side streets to try to keep the fighters out. Security forces also raided numerous homes around the city and arrested suspected political opponents. Armed militiamen entered a hospital to search for government opponents among the wounded. *Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, a cousin and one of Gaddafi's closest aides, defected to Egypt, protesting what he called \\"grave violations of human rights and human and international laws. *The European Union called for Libya to be suspended from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and for the United Nations Security Council to approve a probe to investigate \\"gross and systematic violations of human rights by the Libyan authorities\\", while Switzerland froze all of Gaddafi's assets there. Sources in the UK government including the UK Treasury, announced that Gaddafi's assets were being tracked and that ¬£20 billion in liquid assets and a ¬£10-million mansion in London would be seized within days. 25 February *For the first time in days, thousands took to the streets of Tripoli to protest, with protester and civilian death tolls rising. *The dual military and civilian Mitiga International Airport, about east of Tripoli, seemed to have been taken over by anti-Gaddafi protesters in the afternoon, \\"after a series of defections\\". The Guardian described the takeover as \\"confirmed\\"; Guardian journalist Ian Black, stated, \\"If Mitiga air base near Tripoli is confirmed as having gone over to the Libyan popular uprising it would be a serious blow for the regime close to the heart of the capital.\\" *Gaddafi in Tripoli's Green Square, with a crowd of supporters, \\"Sing, dance and be ready, we will fight those who are against us\\" and \\"If the people of Libya and the Arabs and Africans don't love Muammar Gaddafi then Muammar Gaddafi does not deserve to live.\\" 26 February *United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 was passed unanimously, referring the Libyan government to the International Criminal Court. *Witnesses told Al Jazeera Arabic that Libyan protesters had taken control of a number of areas in Tripoli. Security forces had abandoned the working-class Tajoura district, after five days of anti- government demonstrations, residents told foreign correspondents who visited the area. *In Benghazi, a small naval base became controlled by the opposition. The naval force consisted of a missile cruiser, a frigate, a decommissioned minesweeper and a decommissioned submarine. The commander of the fleet that remained, after his superiors deserted their posts, said that he would defend the city against Gaddafi forces, saying that \\"He [Gaddafi] means nothing to me, he sees the east part of the country as enemies and he will do anything to exterminate us\\". *In Benghazi, a spokesman for the revolution told Agence France-Presse that they were drawing up plans for a transitional government to take power, but in the nearby town of Ajdabiya, local residents said food was becoming scarce. *By the end of the day, an interim government had been formed by former justice minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil. Libyan Ambassador to the US Ali Suleiman Aujali became the first Libyan diplomat to recognise the new government. *For the first time, US President Barack Obama urged Gaddafi to step down from power and avoid further violence. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took the same stance. National Transitional Council established (27 February ‚Äì 3 March) 27 February *After distancing itself from the Gaddafi government, the Italian government officially suspended the \\"friendship\\" treaty it holds with Libya. The treaty forbids warfare or military confrontation between the two states, but the suspension of the treaty would allow otherwise. *On 27 February, the Tripoli Post reported that the UN Security Council on 26 February had voted unanimously to impose sanctions against the Libyan authorities, imposing an arms embargo and freezing the assets of its leaders, while referring the ongoing violent repression of civilian demonstrators to the International Criminal Court. *Gaddafi gave an interview to Serbian television station RTV Pink, calling the UN Security Council resolution \\"invalid in accordance with the United Nations Charter\\" and that the resolution was based on the news reports rather than on actual state in Libya. He vowed to stay in Libya blaming the \\"foreigners and Al-Qaeda\\" for the unrest, saying that the protests began when \\"the gangs of drugged young men attacked regular army forces\\". *A National Transitional Council was formed in Benghazi. It was created not as a provisional government but rather seeking to act as the \\"political face of the uprising\\". The efforts of former justice minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil to form a provisional government appeared to have stalled. *Tripoli was largely quiet during the morning, with militiamen erecting additional roadblocks and tanks parked at major intersections. Residents said the Libyan leader was arming civilian supporters to set up checkpoints and roving patrols around the capital to control movement and quash dissent. *Zawiya, a city of 290,000 just west of Tripoli, appeared to be a potential focal point for clashes as anti- government forces mounted tanks and anti-aircraft guns throughout the city center, and Gaddafi forces surrounded the outskirts with tanks and military checkpoints, according to an Associated Press reporter who visited the city. *The UK revoked the diplomatic immunity of Gaddafi and his family, UK Foreign Secretary Hague said, urging the dictator to step down. The Belgian government announced that it would shut down its embassy in Tripoli on 28 February, temporarily discontinuing diplomatic activities in the troubled north African state, the foreign ministry said. Canada, France, the UK and the US were among the states that had already temporarily shut their embassies in Tripoli and evacuated their staff amid growing unrest over demands for Gaddafi to quit. *US Secretary of State Clinton offered \\"any kind of assistance\\" to Libyans and opposition groups seeking to overthrow Gaddafi. *Hafiz Ghoga, spokesman for the National Transitional Council, said the council was not an interim government, was not contacting foreign governments and did not want them to intervene. \\"We will help liberate other Libyan cities, in particular Tripoli through our national army, our armed forces, of which part have announced their support for the people,\\" Ghoga said, but he did not give details about how the council would help. Although not a direct response to Clinton's remarks, Ghoga said: \\"We are completely against foreign intervention. The rest of Libya will be liberated by the people and Gaddafi's security forces will be eliminated by the people of Libya.\\" 28 February *It was reported that opposition forces shot down a government warplane during the Battle of Misrata. *The US Navy began positioning several ships near the coast of Libya, although it was still unclear what action they might take. Calls for a military enforced no-fly-zone on Libya became increasingly prominent. UK Prime Minister David Cameron, proposed the idea of a no-fly zone to prevent Gaddafi from airlifting mercenaries and using his military aeroplanes and armoured helicopters against civilians. Rhetoric used by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that the implication of such was likely. Clinton also stepped up her rhetoric against Gaddafi, calling for his immediate removal. *Gaddafi had reportedly appointed the head of Libya's foreign intelligence service to speak to the leadership of the anti-government protesters in the east of Libya. *The US froze US$30 billion of assets belonging to the Libyan government, the largest amount of assets ever frozen. *Pro-Gaddafi forces tried to retake control of the western border crossings with Tunisia that had fallen under opposition control and they bombed an ammunition depot in the rebel-held east, residents in the area said. The Libyan Defense Ministry denied the bombing. *Government forces attacked Zawiya and Misrata, but were repelled by anti-government forces with a small number of casualties on both sides. 1 March *On 1 March, Australian Minister for Defence Stephen Smith confirmed that his government was considering military options against Gaddafi, saying that international intervention to enforce a no-fly zone was probable. Smith asserted that \\"no one is expecting\\" Gaddafi to leave power voluntarily. Al Jazeera reported that Misrata was once again under attack, this time from a combined armor and air assault. According to a witness quoted by Al Jazeera, Gaddafi's forces were using heavy weapons against protesters and rebels in the city, while the anti-Gaddafi forces were fighting back with small arms. *Abdul Fatah Younis, Gaddafi's former interior minister and the leader of a growing rebel force, told Al Jazeera that if Gaddafi could not be dislodged from Tripoli, he would welcome foreign intervention in the form of targeted airstrikes, though he said a land invasion was unwanted and offered the use of Libyan military airbases only in case of emergency to foreign aircraft. Al Jazeera also reported that anti-Gaddafi forces had repulsed a six-hour offensive by government forces attempting to seize Zawiya, securing the city for the opposition. *Rebel leaders debated whether to ask for Western airstrikes under the United Nations banner against military assets of the government. One senior official said, \\"If he falls with no intervention, I'd be happy, but if he's going to commit a massacre, my priority is to save my people.\\" *Brigadier Musa'ed Ghaidan Al Mansouri, the head of the Al Wahat Security Directorate, and Brigadier Hassan Ibrahim Al Qarawi defected to the protester side. *Brigadier Dawood Issa Al Qafsi later defected to the opposition as well. The brigadier also confirmed that the eastern towns of Brega, Bishr, El Agheila, Sultan and Zuwetina are under opposition control as well. *By night, the UN had suspended Libya from the UN Human Rights Council. *Britain's foreign secretary William Hague said that a no-fly zone could be imposed \\"even without a Security Council resolution ‚Äì it depends on the situation on the ground\\". *Gaddafi's government sought to show that it was the state's only legitimate authority and that it continued to feel compassion for areas in the east that fell under the control of its opponents. A total of eighteen trucks loaded with rice, flour, sugar and eggs left Tripoli for Benghazi. Also in the convoy were two refrigerated cars carrying medical supplies. *Gaddafi's government attempted to retake Gharyan and Zliten. The governments's forces were repelled from Zliten, but remained local at Gharyan, where there was ongoing fighting. 2 March *The Gaddafi government attempted to retake the city of Brega, but the attack was largely repelled by the rebels. At least fourteen were reported killed in the fighting, although reporters who came in from the Benghazi area saw only four dead, two of which were apparently pro-Gaddafi fighters. The attack on Brega was believed to be more towards psychological warfare against the eastern cities. *Warplanes were also sent to Ajdabiya in an attempt to bomb the weapons storage. Two fighter jets attacked the weapons storage area, one of which was shot down by anti- aircraft guns. *Benghazian residents stated that a convoy of armed opposition fighters, accompanied by army officers, had embarked on a long journey south. They were expected to attempt to reach Tripoli by navigating around the town of Sirte. *The opposition's interim-government council had formally requested the UN to impose a no-fly zone and to conduct precision air strikes against Gaddafi's forces. US Secretary of State Clinton, after backing down from the idea of a no-fly zone, re-engaged in supporting the idea of a military enforced no-fly zone. The Arab League stated that a no-fly zone was necessary. It also said that in cooperation with the African Union, it could impose a military-enforced no-fly zone without the UN's backing. *By the end of the day, rebels in the southwest city of Ghadames managed to take control of the city. 3 March *The International Criminal Court announced it would begin to launch an investigation into war crimes committed by Gaddafi, his sons and his inner circle. Opposition forces were also to be investigated as well to assure no crimes were being committed on its side. *The Libyan opposition rejected calls from Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez to conduct peaceful dialogue with Gaddafi, after Ch√°vez convinced Gaddafi to start \\"peaceful talks with protesters\\". The Libyan opposition refused to conduct talks or negotiations with the government. Initial rebel advance (4‚Äì5 March) 4 March *Occasional air strikes continued on Ajdabiya's weapon-storage area, with no reported casualties. *Government forces in Tripoli prepared for an expected mass protest by anti-government activists after Friday prayers. By the afternoon, demonstrators gathered in the thousands, but did not amount to a siege of the city. *Government forces attempted to retake the oil refineries in Zawiya, but were met with heavy resistance, with casualties on both sides according to witnesses. During the night, pro-Gaddafi forces withdrew to the outside of the city, according to local witnesses. *According to eye-witness accounts, opposition forces had begun an assault on the small port town of Ra's Lanuf. The opposition forces claimed that they numbered 7,000 personnel in the attack on Ra's Lanuf. They also reported that there were \\"massive\\" defections at the local pro-Gaddafi military base in Ra's Lanuf. *By night, the opposition forces managed to capture the entire town of Ra's Lanuf, including the airbase. 5 March *In battles occurring in the morning of 5 March in Zawiya, thirty-three people were reported killed, twenty-five of them rebels and eight pro-Gaddafi soldiers. Pro-Gaddafi forces used tanks to destroy residential buildings and kill some protesters, but rebels were able to overcome them by capturing some and lighting another six tanks on fire. By mid-day, pro-Gaddafi soldiers were reported to have been beaten back. *Witnesses reported that a fighter jet was shot down in Ra's Lanuf after it attempted to bomb the town. They later report that they had found the remains of two pilots. This incident is confirmed through video evidence. *Rebels prepared to try to capture the city of Sirte, Gaddafi's home town and stronghold. Rebels took control of Bin Jawad, a town between Ra's Lanuf and Sirte. Political divides and hostilities had already formed amongst the local population in Sirte because of the killing of several tribesmen by government forces. *After previously backing down from the idea, France re-engaged in support for a no- fly zone and was working with the US and UK to get the resolution passed. *The National Council established by the opposition declared itself Libya's sole representative. First loyalist offensive (6‚Äì16 March) 6 March *Opposition forces advancing on Sirte were targeted by Libyan warplanes in the morning, although the effectiveness of the airstrikes was unclear, and a witness fighting for the opposition reported heavy fighting in Bin Jawad as Government soldiers apparently launched a counterattack against the town. Al Jazeera reported that opposition forces were massing for a decisive battle at the town of Wadi al Ahmar, which could determine control of Sirte itself. *At least some advancing rebels withdrew toward Ra's Lanuf under helicopter attack, Al Jazeera and Reuters reported, and Libyan warplanes again bombed positions near both Ra's Lanuf and Zawiya. Administration of Bin Jawad was resumed by government forces as the rebels retreated, but Al Jazeera reported opposition forces pushed west after reportedly shooting down an attack helicopter and two warplanes and reasserted control over the hamlet. Al Arabiya and other agencies reported that forces loyal to Gaddafi began shelling the city of Misrata, the largest opposition stronghold in Tripolitania. *According to local witnesses, the rebels fended off the attack on Misrata by Gaddafi's forces. 21 rebels and civilians were killed, including a twelve-year-old boy. 22 of Gaddafi's soldiers were killed, and another twenty captured. 7 March *France and the UK were attempting to get a no- fly zone established through the UN Security Council, after previously backing down from the idea. The gulf states in the Middle East had officially called for a no-fly zone to be placed, and an Arab League emergency meeting will discuss the implication of one backed by its own organization. *Hundreds of Gaddafi's soldiers entered Zawiya with tanks. According to local witnesses, the soldiers used the tanks to fire at houses and many homes were destroyed. The death toll was a minimum of eight, with dozens of civilians casualties expected to be found. Rebels still controlled Zawiya, however, but was fighting the fiercest battle yet, according to witnesses. Some witnesses went on to say \\"the whole town is in ruins\\". *By the morning of 7 March, BBC News had reported that the town of Bin Jawad was under the control of government forces and they were advancing on Ra's Lanuf. *While rebels in Ra's Lanuf managed to successfully fend off attacking infantry forces, fighter jets continued to launch air-strikes in Ra's Lanuf, causing several casualties. 8 March *Air strikes continued on Ra's Lanuf, which was still held by rebels. The air strikes on 8 March caused no casualties. Zawiya was still held by rebels, but under repeated artillery fire by pro-Gaddafi forces. A video posted on YouTube, allegedly provided by Sky News reporters who sneaked into Zawiya, debunked the government's claims that they controlled the city. *The National Transitional Council issued a statement to Gaddafi, saying that if he and his family were to call off fighting and leave Libya within seventy-two hours, the council would not prosecute them for crimes committed. 9 March *Rebels still held on to Zawiya but were still under assault by tanks, snipers, and heavy artillery from Gaddafi's forces. Local witnesses said the government's military temporarily captured Zawiya's main square, but by night were driven back to from the city center. *The rebels attempted to move against Bin Jawad once more; however, after firing off around fifty rockets and making some advances, they were hit by artillery and air strikes and retreated to Ra's Lanuf. The rebels then claimed that they had eventually retaken Bin Jawad, although this could not be confirmed. *The European Parliament urged all European states to recognize the National Interim Council as the government of Libya. 10 March *On 10 March, France officially recognized the National Transitional Council as Libya's only legitimate government. Portugal later also recognized the council. *Zawiya was retaken by government forces. Reporters from The Times and ITV reported from the square in the city where they confirmed it was under government control and clean-up operations were underway. At the same time on the eastern front, after beating back the rebels from Bin Jawad, government forces launched their largest attack yet against Ra's Lanuf and began to move into the town. Opposition forces were in retreat from the city along with some of the civilian population and were attempting to regroup east of Ra's Lanuf. *In spite of Libyan state television claiming that Gaddafi forces had cleared Ras Lanuf of \\"armed gangs\\" and Government military forces intensifying their attack \\"with heavy artillery from the sea and the air\\", anti-Gaddafi forces still controlled the town. *The African Union announces the composition of the Ad- hoc High Level Committee on Libya 11 March *On the morning of 11 March, the first government ground troops entered Ra's Lanuf with 150 soldiers, backed up by three tanks, and managed to get to the town center. At the same time, four transport boats came in from the sea and unloaded between forty and fifty soldiers each on the beach near the Fadeel hotel. They were engaged by hard-core rebel remnants, who had not retreated from the town the previous day. Government troops captured the residential area, but the rebels continued to hold out in the oil-port facilities throughout the day and recaptured much of the town in a counteroffensive in the afternoon. *Rebels claimed they were still in control in Zawiya; however, just a few hours later, a pro-Gaddafi rally was held in the center of the city, witnessed by 100 foreign journalists, confirming the city was retaken. 12 March *On 12 March, rebels fighting in Ra's Lanuf retreated in the afternoon to the town of Uqayla west of Brega. Later during the day, the government took foreign journalists to the city for confirmation of the town's fall. *Arab League Secretary- General Amr Moussa called for a no-fly zone to be put in place after previously resisting the idea. The league met and did not allow Libyan diplomats from Gaddafi's government to join despite Gaddafi's government's request to attend. The league \\"called on the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya in a bid to protect civilians from air attack\\". Its request was announced by Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah. He stated that all member states present at the talks agreed with this. *The league also announced it now recognized the National Transitional Council as the government of Libya. *Al Jazeera cameraman Ali Hassan al-Jaber was shot dead near Benghazi. He was the first journalist killed since the uprising started. 13 March *Before dawn on 13 March, pro-Gaddafi forces, advancing eastward from Ra's Lanuf, had taken the town of Uqayla and the village of Bisher and were heading toward Brega. Rebel forces in Brega had started a retreat for Ajdabiya. Brega was captured later in the day by pro-Gaddafi forces. *According to human-rights watchers, Tripoli was in a state of fear as pro-Gaddafi forces arrested people along with disappearances taking place. According to residents of the city, scores of anti-government protesters had been arrested and were subjected to torture. *Ali Atiyya, a colonel of the Libyan Air Force at the Mitiga military airport near Tripoli defected and joined the rebellion. *Amnesty International condemned the killing of al-Jaber, the Al Jazeera journalist, the day before. *Rebels forces returned to fight in Brega. Reports from rebels and Al Jazeera sources claimed that the rebels had recaptured the town, killing twenty-five of Gaddafi's soldiers and capturing twenty in the process. With the destruction of the Ra's Lanuf oil refinery, Gaddafi only controlled one oil refinery in Zawiya.

On 19 February, another funeral procession passed the Katiba compound, and were again fired on. Fighting broke out, and opposition forces commandeered bulldozers and tried to breach the walls of the Katiba compound, but were met with withering fire. Protesters also used stones and crude bombs made of tin cans stuffed with gunpowder. As the fighting continued, a mob attacked an army base on the outskirts of Benghazi and disarmed the soldiers. Among the equipment confiscated were three small tanks, which were rammed into the compound. The fighting stopped on 20 February, and another thirty people had been killed during the previous twenty-four hours of fighting.https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/02/20/libya-governments-should-demand- end-unlawful-killings By 20 February, violent clashes also broke out in Misrata between government forces and demonstrators.

Opposition fighters resumed their assault, bolstered by reinforcements from Bayda and Derna. During the final assault, forty-two people were killed. Libyan Interior Minister Abdul Fatah Younis showed up with a special forces squad to relieve the compound, but Younis defected to the opposition and announced safe passage for loyalists out of the city.

According to a doctor in Ra's Lanuf who treated government casualties from Ajdabiya and the road from Benghazi, the airstrikes caused hundreds of casualties among government forces, morale dropped, and soldiers were faking injuries to escape the fighting. According to the doctor, \\"the first day, we had 56 seriously wounded. To the head, to the brain, lost arms and legs. Soldiers with a lot of shrapnel in them. It was like that every day after\\". The doctor said that he did not know how many soldiers were killed, but that soldiers who came to the hospital said that there were 150 dead on the first day of airstrikes, and that there were less after that, as they hid.

Following the attacks, angry mobs of Gaddafi loyalists burned and vandalized the British and Italian embassies, a US consulate, and a UN office, prompting the UN to pull its staff out of Tripoli. The strike came shortly after Gaddafi called for a mutual cease-fire and negotiations with NATO. A NATO official said before Saturday's strike that the alliance would keep up pressure until the U.N. Security Council mandate on Libya was fulfilled. The NATO official noted that Gaddafi's forces had attacked Misrata hours before his speech. Opposition leaders called the cease-fire offers publicity stunts. \\"We don't believe that there is a solution that includes him or any member of his family. So it is well past any discussions. The only solution is for him to depart,\\" said rebel spokesperson Jalal al-Galal.

Gaddafi operations in rebel areas Following the withdrawal of government forces from cities as they fell, members of Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees remained, and launched a series of shootings and bombings against civilians and spied on local rebel activity. They also assassinated a military commander who defected to the rebels and a journalist, both of them in Benghazi. On 1 June, suspected Gaddafi loyalists blew up a car in front of a Benghazi hotel where foreign journalists and diplomats were staying. Rebels claimed that pro-Gaddafi agents in Benghazi may be acting as spies for the regime, seeking to corrode the uprising on the inside. According to a Benghazi resident, Gaddafi's supporters were in hiding, organizing themselves for when the government retook Benghazi. Estimates of the number of Gaddafi sympathizers in Benghazi ranged from 300 to 6,000. Rebel Information Minister Mahmud Shammam told journalists that small sleeper cells of Gaddafi's agents existed. Rebel forces responded with a security crackdown, arresting hundreds of suspects over a several-week period. Many arrests were carried out by civilian \\"protection squads\\" not sanctioned by the National Transitional Council. Some of the suspects targeted by the rebels were armed and engaged in shootouts, resulting in casualties on both sides. Rebels often arrested suspects based on criteria such as the regime loyalty of their hometown, a photograph of Gaddafi in their wallet, and family ties. However, the rebels also used other methods to discover Gaddafi supporters, such as sending women into the homes of suspects to pretend to be in need of something while searching for guns. Some suspects were arrested after their friends reported that they were loyal to Gaddafi. One detainee died of torture while in custody. Some suspects were summarily executed rather than being arrested. An official in the rebel security agency stated that six of Gaddafi's former internal security agents were found dead in one week.

Their activities included attacking two Benghazi jails, freeing more than 200 inmates. In late July, opposition forces attacked the brigade's base near Benghazi, and overran the base after several hours. The rebels lost four dead and six injured, while the Al-Nidaa Brigade suffered about twenty casualties, with another 31 fighters arrested. June helicopter strikes British AgustaWestland Apache helicopters are being used to attack Pro-Gaddafi forces from the British amphibious assault ship British and French forces began employing helicopter attacks against Libyan targets on 3 June as part of Operation Unified Protector. The attack helicopters were used to attack communications and control facilities, and were able to target Gaddafi forces in populated areas while minimizing risks to civilians. According to UK Defense Secretary Liam Fox, the employment of helicopters was an extension of the way in which fast jets had been used in ground attacks and did not signify a change in tactics. Operating from , British AH1 Apache attack helicopters armed with Hellfire missiles and heavy chainguns disabled a military checkpoint and a radar station near Brega. British attack aircraft supported the helicopters by destroying one military installation. Meanwhile, two munition storage depots were destroyed in a separate mission in central Libya.

Rebels claimed that 16 rebels and 50 loyalists were killed, and that at least 40 rebels were wounded, in addition to civilian casualties. Another 61 were wounded when loyalist forces shelled Dafniya with tanks, artillery, and incendiary rockets. However, a subsequent attack by loyalist infantry and armor was repulsed. Loyalist forces also surrounded Zliten. According to rebel military spokesman Ahmed Bani, the troops were equipped artillery and Grad rockets. Residents were allegedly threatened with shelling and rape by mercenaries if they did not surrender.

Meanwhile, rebel forces began conducting a flanking operation against Gaddafi forces to push them from Zliten. As the rebel offensive progressed, opposition fighters conducted small-scale attacks against government forces in Tripoli, although few of the attacks were apparently effective. Residents claimed that several significant assaults took place in late May and early June. At night, gunfire was frequently heard in the city, with some residents claiming that it was security forces clashing with opposition fighters, and Libyan authorities claiming it to be celebratory gunfire. In addition, protesters held \\"flash\\" protests, chanting anti-Gaddafi slogans for several minutes before melting away, hanged the rebel flag from bridges, and spray-painted anti-Gaddafi graffiti at night. Due to fears of rebels smuggling weapons into the city, authorities set up checkpoints in the city and roadblocks at the entrances, searching cars. According to some media reports, poorly trained students were given weapons and told to man checkpoints, due to a shortage of regular military forces in the city. On 19 June, nine civilians were killed in a NATO airstrike on Tripoli. Reporters were taken to the location of the strike and saw bodies being pulled out of the rubble of a destroyed building. NATO said that it was investigating the reports. Later in the same day, NATO acknowledged being responsible for the airstrike and the civilian deaths. NATO claimed that it was targeting a missile site, but that a bomb apparently missed its target due to a weapon systems failure and hit a civilian target instead.\\"Libya: Nato Admits Civilian Deaths as Gaddafi Regime Claims Propaganda Coup\\" . The Daily Telegraph. On the front-line, the fights continued around Dafniya near Misrata with artillery fire from both sides. On 20 June, Gaddafi government officials claimed that NATO killed 19 civilians in the town of Sorman, west of Tripoli. This came only a day after NATO admitted to accidentally killing civilians in a separate airstrike in Tripoli. NATO stated that the target in Sorman was a military command and control node.

Battle for Tripoli On 20 August, rebel elements in Tripoli supported by NATO launched a general uprising codenamed Operation Mermaid Dawn in the city. Many of the weapons used by rebels had been assembled and sent to Tripoli by tugboat. Opposition forces in the city launched a general uprising, surrounding almost every neighborhood, with especially heavy fighting occurring in Fashloom, Tajura, and Souk al-Jomaa. Rebels suffered high casualties, while Gaddafi forces also took losses. NATO warplanes supported the operation by conducting bombing runs over government targets in the city. Following a night of heavy fighting, rebels controlled all or parts of the Tajura, Souk al-Jomaa, Araba, Qadah, Ben Ashour, and Zawiyat al-Dahmani, with fighting continuing in some areas the following day, including in Mitiga International Airport.

Gaddafi's wife and three children flee to Algeria As the Battle for Tripoli reached a climax in mid-August, the Gaddafi family were forced to abandon their fortified compound. On 27 August, it was reported by the Egyptian news agency Mena that Libyan rebel fighters had seen five armoured Mercedes-Benz sedans, possibly carrying top Gaddafi regime figures, cross the border at the southwestern Libyan town of Ghadames towards Algeria, which at the time was denied by the Algerian authorities. On 29 August, the Algerian government officially announced that Safia Farkash, with daughter Ayesha and sons Muhammad and Hannibal, accompanied by their spouses and children, had crossed into Algeria earlier that day. An Algerian Foreign Ministry official said that all the people in the convoy were now in Algiers, and that none of them had been named in warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for possible war crimes charges. Mourad Benmehidi, the Algerian permanent representative to the United Nations, later confirmed the details of the statement. The family had arrived at a Sahara desert entry point, in a Mercedes and a bus at 8:45 a.m. local time. The exact number of people in the party was unconfirmed, but there were \\"many children\\", and they did not include Colonel Gaddafi. The group was allowed in on humanitarian grounds, and the Algerian government has since informed the head of the National Transitional Council, who had made no official request for their return. Remaining Gaddafi family Gaddafi and the whereabouts of other members of his family remained unknown. A LD 2 million bounty was placed by a group of businessmen, supported by the NTC, on anyone who brings Colonel Gaddafi to the NTC, dead or alive. After the fall of Tripoli, son Saadi stated in various media interviews that he had been authorised to negotiate a transfer of power to the NTC. On 31 August, Saif al- Islam claimed to be talking to Damascus-based Alrai TV from a Tripoli suburb, and said in an audio interview that \\"the resistance continues and victory is near\\". On 19 November, he was captured in the southern Libyan desert near the Niger border by the fighters from the Zintan Brigades. After his capture he was flown to Zintan. On 20 November, Abdullah Senussi, Muammar Gaddafi's brother-in-law, was also captured. He was found at his brother's house about 100 kilometers north of Sabha. He is currently being held in Sabha. International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo arrived on 22 November in Libya for talks with the Libyan government. Both Saif al-Islam and Abdullah Senussi are currently under indictment by the ICC in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, but will probably be tried in Libya first. After the fall of Tripoli With the taking of Tripoli by rebel forces, the largest cities under loyalist control were Tarhuna to the south of the capital, Sirte on the gulf, and Sabha with its military installations in the southern desert. Secondary cities were Bani Walid to the south of Tarhuna, and Hun between Sirte and Sabha. Southern desert The NTC said that the desert town of Hun had greater strategic value than Bani Walid or Sirte. The NTC had plans to deal with Hun and Sabha and its military bases after they take Sirte, but by early September local rebels had taken over part of the town and the NTC was sending in fighters. There have been attempts to cut off supplies to Sabha, but reports from the region are sketchy. Several smaller towns in the southern desert have fallen to the non-Arab Tubu. On 21 September, the NTC reported its forces had captured Sabha. Remaining villages holding out against the revolutionaries were taken in the subsequent days, with anti-Gaddafi fighters seizing control of the garrison town of Ghat by month's end. Tripolitanian interior With loyalist forces expelled from Tripoli itself, fighting continued to the south of the city, with attacks on the airport from Tarhuna. Bani Walid further south had a large loyalist presence, but local officials had promised not to attack rebel positions, and there were no reports of fighting. By 28 August, however, there was fighting in Tarhuna, with its capture by rebels that day or the next. Khamis Gaddafi, the youngest son of Muammar Gaddafi and one of the regime's most notorious generals, was apparently killed by either a NATO strike or an ambush by rebel technicals in his attempt to flee Tarhuna for Bani Walid. Rebels then approached Bani Walid from both Tripoli and Misrata. Four attempts to seize the town failed, with pro-Gaddafi holdouts putting up fierce resistance and benefiting from Bani Walid's defensible terrain. The town was finally wrested from the control of pro-Gaddafi holdouts on 17 October, with many of its defenders fleeing into the surrounding valleys in the face of a concerted push by anti-Gaddafi reinforcements. Western coast Since the rebel taking of Sorman, both parties controlled part of the road between Tripoli and Tunisia, preventing either from supplying Tripoli from that country. The rebels made a successful attack on the border town of Ras Ajdir on 26 August, and on 28 August Tunisia reopened its border with Libya. It appeared that by that time rebels had taken the last intervening town, Ajaylat, consolidating the route to the capital, where shortages of food, water, fuel, and medical supplies were creating difficulties, though later reports indicated that a loyalist \\"pocket\\" remained at Ajaylat, with supply lines bypassing the town. Loyalist forces continued to shell the area from the interior. Central coast Despite the fall of Tripoli, loyalists continued to fight from Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte. Rebel forces approached from Misrata in the west and Benghazi in the east, but on both fronts they were held up by loyalists forces dug into small towns. On 27 August, eastern forces passed Bin Jawad, the last town of any size before Sirte. On 1 September, they announced that since Sirte has no economic importance, if it does not surrender, they would prefer to cut supplies and wait it out to minimize casualties. In the afternoon of 8 September, it was reported that NTC forces had taken the Red Valley, a heavily defended area about 60 km east of Sirte. On 16 September, the NLA took control over Sirte's airport and launched a major offensive into the city itself. Sirte fell on 20 October, and Muammar Gaddafi and several other leading regime figures including his son Mutassim were found and killed as they attempted to flee the city. The engagement marked the end of the war. Post conflict planning Unfreezing of assets From 20 August onwards, diplomats of the United States, the United Kingdom and France began working on a UN resolution to release some of the frozen Libyan assets to the NTC. Resistance was met from China and Russia, who felt that the move would formally recognise the NTC as the de facto government of Libya. On 25 August, the UN sanctions committee released $500 million of frozen Libyan assets following a direct request by the US. South Africa only agreed on the condition the money would be used for humanitarian purposes, but blocked the release of a further $1 billion for the NTC itself. As a result, on 31 August, the British Royal Air Force flew the first LD 280 million of a shipment of LD 2 billion, that were blocked from entering the country at the start of the conflict. The money was to be handed over direct to the Central Bank of Libya, authorised by the UN on humanitarian grounds, and particularly to pay Libyan Government workers during Eid ul-Fitr, some of whom had not been paid for over three months.

The brook silverside lives in slow moving rivers and lakes from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi Basin and Gulf Coastal Plains. The brook silverside survives best in clear water with aquatic vegetation. L. sicculus feeds on a diet of copepods, insect larvae, and winged insects. The spawning season of the brook silverside occurs during the spring and early summer. The survival of freshwater fishes such as the brook silverside is increasingly threatened. In order to ensure survival of the brook silverside, turbidity of natural habitats should be monitored. Geographic distribution A preserved specimen of Labidesthes sicculus The distribution of brook silverside populations range from the Great Lakes southward through the Mississippi Basin and Gulf Coastal Plains (including 27 U.S. states and parts of Canada). It is native to the majority of this distribution, but has also been stocked outside of its natural range as forage food for sport fishes.Jonna, R. (2004): Actinopterygii. NatureServe. The brook silverside occupies freshwater lakes, ponds, quiet pools and small rivers. The environment ranges from cool to warm water Marsden, J.E., Langdon, R.W. & Good, S.P. (2000): First occurrence of the brook silverside (Labidesthes sicculus) in Lake Champlain, Vermont. Northeastern Naturalist, 7 (3): 248-254. with variability in levels of gradient and vegetation. Consistently, however, the brook silverside prefers clear water with low substrate concentrations. The brook silverside is vulnerable to turbid waters.Powles, P.M. & Sandeman, I.M. (2008): Growth, summer cohort output, and observations on the reproduction of brook silverside, Labidesthes sicculus (Cope) in the Kawartha Lakes, Ontario. Environmental Biology of Fishes, 82 (4): 421-431. In Tennessee, brook silverside populations were shown to have decreased shortly after the construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. Populations likely declined because of introduced competition.Strongin, K., Taylor, C.M., Roberts, M.E., Neill, W.H. & Gelwick, F. (2011): Food Habits and Dietary Overlap of Two Silversides in the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway: The Invasive Menidia audens Versus the Native Labidesthes sicculus. The American Midland Naturalist, 166 (1): 224-233. Ecology The brook silverside is on the lower end of the food chain, and is preyed on by many larger fish. The diet of the brook silverside consists mostly of zooplankton. They are highly specialized feeders with cladocerans comprising 80% of their diet, (40%) small flying insects, and (20%) midge larvae. Their diet varies with life stages and seasons. At a younger age, the brook silverside preys mostly on smaller fish. Their diet shifts to immature insects later. During winter, the brook silverside eats mostly planktonic crustaceans. Because of both intentional and unintentional species introduction, the brook silverside must compete for food sources. Specifically, the brook silverside has been forced to compete with the non-native Menidia audens, which was introduced by waterway construction. This forced competition of resources has led to a decrease in brook silverside populations.Morris, J.E. (1982): Distribution and food habits of the inland silverside, Menidia beryllina, and the northern brook silverside, Labidesthes sicculus, in Lake Conroe, Texas. Master's Thesis. Texas A&M; University. 57 pp. Life history The brook silverside breeds in the summer from late May to mid-August. Their life span is only one year.Bloom, D.D., Piller, K.R., Lyons, J., Mercado-Silva, N. & Medina-Nava, M. (2009): Systematics and Biogeography of the Silverside Tribe Menidiini (Teleostomi: Atherinopsidae) Based on the Mitochondrial ND2 Gene. Copeia, 2009 (2): 408-417. During the first year, they have rapid growth, growing up to one millimeter per day. Brook silversides quickly reach a maximum size of approximately eight centimeters. They reach sexual maturity by the first summer in order to reproduce. Some studies report that brook silversides reproduce by internal fertilization, although this has not been entirely confirmed. When the eggs are produced, they have an attached filament, which allows for the eggs to be deposited on logs, plants and rocks. Temperature does not affect the sex of fish. After the eggs hatch, they immediately swim away from the shore into deeper water, but still stay just under the surface.Pratt, K.E., Hargrave, C.W. & Gido, K.B. (2002): Rediscovery of Labidesthes sicculus (Atherinidae) in Lake Texoma (Oklahoma-Texas). The Southwestern Naturalist, 47 (1): 142‚Äì147. They congregate in large schools. The brook silverside migrates throughout its life cycle. No human-induced changes are reported as affecting the life history.Hubbs, C.L. (1921): An Ecological Study of the Life-History of the Fresh-Water Atherine Fish Labidesthes sicculus. Ecology, 2 (4): 262-276. Human-induced changes are reported as more strongly affecting populations rather than behaviors. Current management Human intervention through species introduction, habitat alteration, pollution, and construction are causing the decline of the brook silverside and other freshwater fishes. Freshwater fishes account for the majority of extinctions in ray-finned fishes. To stabilize and increase populations, no more dams or waterways should be built. Additionally, pollution must be stopped. Agricultural runoff creates turbid waters, which the brook silverside cannot thrive in. Stream sampling occurs through organizations such as USFWS and TVA (locally). This allows for populations to be monitored and stream chemistry to be controlled. Over-fishing and hybridization aren't causing brook silverside populations to decline. Invasive species and habitat destruction have the greatest impact on population decline. Areas are being reserved for the preservation of endemic fish, but more must still be done.

It is categorized as a warm water pan-fish. Early settlers said that this species of sunfish resembled a European species they called bream. Historically it has been found along the Southern Atlantic coastal drainages from North Carolina to Florida, and west to Texas.Hubbs, C., R.J. Edwards, and G. P. Garrett. 1991. An Annotated Checklist of the Freshwater Fishes of Texas with keys to Identification of Species. The Texas Journal of Science 43(4):1-56. Lepomis marginatus mainly feeds on detritus and filamentous algae as well as a few terrestrial insects (Homoptera, Hymenoptera, Etnier, and Starnes). The juvenile and mature fish do not have many predators, but the eggs in the nest are in danger of predation from a few different species of fish. The dollar sunfish can have different breeding seasons depending on where it is located geographically. On average the dollar sunfish breeds from April to September, and in some states such as North Carolina, it breeds from May to August. They always finish breeding before the weather turns cold. These fish breed mainly on sandy substrates. \\"Bourgeois\\" males build and tend nests, court females, and care for eggs and young.Breder CM. (1936) The Reproductive habits of North American Sunfishes (family Centrarchidae). Zoologica,21,1-47. The average lifespan is around 6 years, and it can grow up to a maximum of 100 mm. Currently there are very well managed creel limits for the sunfish species. The creel limits help to protect the species from being over harvested. Other species of sunfish have been stocked in Tennessee lakes, however the dollar sunfish has yet to be stocked in any of the river drainages of Tennessee. Geographic distribution Historically, the dollar sunfish has been found along Southern Atlantic coastal drainages from North Carolina to Florida, and extending west to Texas. The species is most common in the southeastern United States, becoming increasingly uncommon in the western part of its range Robinson, H.W., and T.M. Buchanan. 1988. Fishes of Arkansas. The university of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville Arkansas.Loftus, W.F., and J.A. Kushlan. 1987. Freshwater Fishes of Southern Florida Bulletin of the Florida State Museum, Biological Sciences 31(4):1-344. Its Current range in North America is the Tar river in North Carolina to Brazos river in Texas in the USA; Former Mississippi Embayment in the US from western Kentucky and eastern Arkansas south to Gulf of Mexico. There have been a few records of the dollar sunfish in the Tennessee and Mississippi river drainage. However, due to its great similarity in appearance to younger specimens of the longear sunfish, L. megalotis, the distribution of L. marginatus has not been well understood in certain portions of its range.Etnier, D.A., and W.C. Starnes. 1993. The Fishes of Tennessee, University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville. 681pp. Ecology The dollar sunfish has a fairly specific diet. Due to its small gape size it cannot open its mouth large enough to eat many of the smaller larvae fish swimming in its habitat. Instead its diet consists of much smaller living organisms. McLane listed midge larvae and microcrustaceans as the major food items for dollar sunfish. Stomachs of specimens from Tennessee contained much detritus and filamentous algae and a few terrestrial insects (Homoptera, Hymenoptera), probably indicating both benthic- and surface-oriented feeding behavior. This means that the dolar sunfish feeds on living organisms both in the water and on top of the water. They seem to focus more on the easier attainable prey, which means they don't expend a lot of energy for feeding. The juveniles and adults do not have many predators other than humans. However the eggs and larvae are at risk of predation from larger fish such as largemouth bass, other sunfish, and some invertebrates. The only real competitor the dollar sunfish might have is another species of sunfish. This is highly unlikely though because the different species of sunfish usually occupy different habitats and zones. The micro-distribution of the dollar sunfish is characterized by a pH of 7 - 7.8, and a temperature of 16 - 28 degrees Celsius (61 - 82 degrees Fahrenheit) They are often found in slow moving, small to large streams, floodplain pools, and oxbow lakes, ponds, and vegetated areas of large reservoirs. More specifically they are usually found over substrates of sand or clay overlain with silt and organic debris, and are often associated with submerged aquatic vegetation, hydrophytes, and overhanging vegetation along undercut banks. Life history The spawning season of the dollar sunfish occurs in the spring, from April - October at water temperatures of 16.8 - 25.6 degrees Celsius; peak spawning activity during late spring and summer.Davis, J.R. 1972. The Spawning Behavior, Fecundity Rates and Food Habits of the Redbreast Sunfish in Southeastern North Carolina. Proc. Ann. Meet., Southeastern Assoc. Game Fish Comm. 25:566-60. Their nests are solitary, usually adjacent to logs or some other structure; nests range from 30 ‚Äì 94 cm in diameter, are 15 ‚Äì 20 cm deep at center, and are usually constructed over sand.Davis, J.R. 1972. The Spawning Behavior, Fecundity Rates and Food Habits of the Redbreast Sunfish in southeastern North Carolina. Proc. Ann. Meet., Southeastern Assoc. Game Fish Comm. 25:566-60. Usually the males will make the nest on a hard sand substrate. Females produce an average of 3302 eggs, with a range of 322 - 9206, depending on their body size.Sandow, Jr, J.T., D.R. Holder, and L.E. Moswain. 1975. Life History of the Redbreast sunfish in the Satilla River, Georgia. In Proceedings of the Annual Conference Southeaster Association of Game and Fish COmmissioners. 28(1974):279-295. Individuals in Carolina are mature at age two and have a life span of six years. There are not many human induced factors influencing the life history of the dollar sunfish. However, as dams were built across the Tennessee and Mississippi river valley the populations seemed to decrease. The dams took away their natural habitat, but the dollar sunfish have adapted and can now be found in some reservoirs in West Tennessee and Florida. Management Laws and regulations exist to protect dollar sunfish populations. Most states enforce a creel limit, which is a limit on the maximum number of fish that a single person can catch in one day. However, there is no creel limit or size limit for the nongame pan fish in the state of Tennessee. The dollar sunfish is not federally or state listed as threatened or endangered. However it is rare to find dollar sunfish in its western range; the abundance has decreased a lot over the past twenty years. There is no true explanation for the decline in abundance, but some fish managers hypothesize that habitat destruction is the leading cause. In the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, there is a large problem with habitat destruction. Hurricanes can destroy the vegetation and cover where the dollar sunfish lives. There are no true biological causes of decline of the dollar sunfish species. They are very small, and not a true target of anglers, so it is unlikely that they are overfished. An issue in the lakes with more plankton is the clarity of the water; dumping trash and stirring up the clay and silt with boats reduces the plankton populations. The water becomes too dark and no sunlight can get through to help the plankton grow, thus the dollar sunfish food supply decreases. Humans can help to protect the habitat of the dollar sunfish by managing the aquatic vegetation in the rivers and reservoirs. Also there should be larger fines for dumping trash into the rivers and lakes. However, the state conservation or resource agencies, such as TWRA, are the only groups currently working to protect this species. There are also some areas set aside in the Mississippi and Ohio Valley Plains to help conserve the populations.

Smoot Fahlgren founded Fahlgren & Associates in Parkersburg, West Virginia, in 1962. After expansion through West Virginia and Pittsburgh, Pa., the company merged with the advertising agency owned by Cincinnati-based David Ferris in 1970 to create Fahlgren & Ferris. From there, expansion continued to Philadelphia, Toledo, Columbus, Washington, D.C., New York City and Atlanta.  Acquisitions  Fahlgren & Ferris and Swink Advertising merged to form Fahlgren & Swink on July 1, 1984. The merged companies together acquired Atlanta-based Nucifora & Associates. In October 1988, Fahlgren & Swink was acquired by Lintas New York Inc., a subsidiary of The Interpublic Group of Companies. At the time, Fahlgren had offices in Parkersburg, W. Va.; Atlanta; Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo, Ohio; Greensboro, N.C., and Tampa. When Interpublic acquired another company, Ammirati & Puris, which was the lead national creative agency for Burger King, the conflict with Fahlgren client McDonald‚Äôs presented the opportunity for the company to buy itself back from the holding company, again becoming an independent company. In 1989, Fahlgren & Swink acquired Florida-based Benito Advertising, which had offices in Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville and handled multiple Florida co-ops of McDonald‚Äôs. The resulting company was named Fahlgren & Swink/Benito. In May 1990, Fahlgren & Swink bought Hawley & Martin and became known as Fahlgren & Martin, with David N. Martin serving as chairman. In 1993, Fahlgren Martin sold Hawley Martin to Arnold Fortuna Lawner & Cabot, again becoming known as Fahlgren. 2009-present In 2009, Neil Mortine was named CEO of Fahlgren. Throughout 2010, Fahlgren Mortine completed three acquisitions, beginning in January with the acquisition of Cleveland, Ohio-based Edward Howard & Co., followed in March by the acquisition of Columbus, Ohio-based GRIP Technology, and, finally, in November with the acquisition of certain assets of Sabatino/Day of Dayton, Ohio. In 2010, Fahlgren celebrated 35 years as agency of record for McDonald‚Äôs co-ops across the country. The company handled advertising and public relations for multiple co-ops in Ohio and Florida.

Web. Retrieved 11 November 2012. http://www.midwestfw.org/documents/FisheriesAbstracts.pdf There could be a number of causes for the decrease in the Lepomis miniatus in Illinois. A popular theory is that the redspotted sunfish has struggled due to a loss of wetlands, which make up the sunfish's natural habitat. The population may also be declining due to increasingly poor water conditions or from competition with invasive species.Great Rivers: Restoring Wetlands Gives Fish a Fighting Chance.

Zooplankton make up between 33.3% to 74.6% of the diet of small sunfishes, about 50% of the diet of medium-sized sunfishes as they introduce larger prey into their diet. At larger sizes the redspotted sunfish shifts primarily to benthic macrofauna.VanderKooy, K.E., C.F. Rakocinski, and R.W. Heard. 2000. Trophic relationships of three sunfishes (Lepomis spp.) in an estuarine bayou. North American Journal of Fisheries Management. Vol 23-5: 621-632. Many larger carnivorous fish feed on the redspotted sunfish, primarily bass.Martin, C.W., M.M. Valentine, and J.F. Valentine. 2010. Competitive Interactions between Invasive Nile Tilapia and Native Fish: The Potential for Altered Trophic Exchange and Modification of Food Webs. PLOS ONE. Vol 5-12: Article e14395. Lepomis miniatus is commonly found in shallow and highly vegetative water. The species seems to prefer areas of slow moving water, 0.4 cm/s. While the redspotted sunfish has been shown to compete with other sunfish and some invasive species, like the Rio Grande cichlid in Louisiana, this competition is thought to have little effect in most cases due to the generalist diet of Lepomis miniatus.Lorenz, T.O., M.T. O'Connell, and P.J. Schofield. 2011. Aggressive interactions between the invasive Rio Grande cichlid (Herichthys cyanoguttatus) and native bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), with notes on redspotted sunfish (Lepomis miniatus). Journal of Ethology. Vol 29-1: 39-46 A more direct danger could be invasives who force the Lepomis miniatus out of its preferred habitat, thus increasing the risk of predation. Human induced changes that might affect the redspotted sunfish could be the reduction in habitat itself, seeing as how they inhabit smaller bodies of water due to their preference for shallow, vegetative, water. They also might directly hurt the water quality through pollution, like in the case of the Wabash River in Illinois which saw the species decline possibly due to oil pollution. Life history The breeding time of the redspotted sunfish varies across the range of the species but usually occurs in late spring or early summer.

The average lifespan of the Lepomis miniatus is about five to six years, six being the maximum age the species tends to reach. The effect of human induced changes on this life history is unknown at this time. Also they can be found in the great lakes Conservation and management Decimation of the sunfish was probably the result of drainage of swamps and bottomland lakes and the general deterioration of the water quality. There is some concern that the release of the invasive Nile tilapia into waters inhabited by the redspotted sunfish could be detrimental to the species. In Illinois the redspotted sunfish has been listed as endangered in that state. Fortunately a number of organizations have been working to help the species recover and are hoping to get the sunfish's status reduced to threatened in Illinois by 2014. The main groups who are working to rehabilitate Lepomis miniatus are the Nature Conservancy in conjunction with the Illinois Natural History Survey and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. These conservation efforts have involved transplanting a portion of the redspotted sunfish population into two protected, suitable, bodies of water. The first being a preserve lake in Emiquon Nature Preserve and the second being a refuge pond in Allerton Park. These populations have spawned enough fish to stock five more suitable bodies of water. The redspotted sunfish is listed as an endangered species in the state of Illinois. It is being reintroduced into the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge near Havana, Illinois.

The ship was laid down in August 1937 and launched in July 1939, after which the Soviet Union requested to purchase the ship. The Kriegsmarine agreed to the sale in February 1940, and the transfer was completed on 15 April. The vessel was still incomplete when sold to the Soviet Union, with only half of her main battery of eight guns installed and much of the superstructure missing. Renamed Petropavlovsk in September 1940, work on the ship was delayed by poor German-Soviet co-operation in crew training and provision of technical literature to enable completion of the ship, which was being carried out in the Leningrad shipyards. Still unfinished when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the ship briefly took part in the defense of Leningrad by providing artillery support to the Soviet defenders. She was heavily damaged by German artillery in September 1941, sunk in April 1942, and raised in September 1942. After repairs were effected, the ship was renamed Tallinn and used in the Soviet counter-offensive that relieved Leningrad in 1944. After the end of the war, the ship was used as a stationary training platform and as a floating barracks before being broken up for scrap sometime between 1953 and 1960.  Design  Recognition drawing of an Admiral Hipper-class cruiser The of heavy cruisers was ordered in the context of German naval rearmament after the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 and repudiated the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1935, Germany signed the Anglo‚ÄìGerman Naval Agreement with Great Britain, which provided a legal basis for German naval rearmament; the treaty specified that Germany would be able to build five \\"treaty cruisers\\". The Admiral Hippers were nominally within the 10,000-ton limit, though they significantly exceeded the figure. L√ºtzow was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of . L√ºtzow was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines, which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra-high pressure oil-fired boilers. The ship's top speed was , at . As designed, her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men. L√ºtzows primary armament was eight SK L/60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets, placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Her anti- aircraft battery was to have consisted of twelve L/65 guns, twelve guns, and eight guns. The ship also would have carried a pair of triple torpedo launchers abreast of the rear superstructure. The ship was to have been equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult. L√ºtzows armored belt was thick; her upper deck was thick while the main armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick faces and 70 mm thick sides.  Service history  L√ºtzow was ordered by the Kriegsmarine from the Deschimag shipyard in Bremen. L√ºtzow was originally designed as a light cruiser version of the Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruisers, armed with twelve guns instead of the Admiral Hippers eight guns. The Kriegsmarine decided, however, to complete the ship identically to Admiral Hipper on 14 November 1936. Her keel was laid on 2 August 1937, under construction number 941. The ship was launched on 1 July 1939, but was not completed. In October 1939, the Soviet Union approached Germany with a request to purchase the then unfinished Admiral Hipper-class cruisers L√ºtzow, , and , along with plans for German capital ships, naval artillery, and other naval technology. The Kriegsmarine denied the request for Seydlitz and Prinz Eugen, but agreed to sell L√ºtzow, as well as gun turrets and other weaponry. The price for the heavy cruiser was set at 150 million Reichsmarks, nearly double the original cost of the vessel, which was 83,590,000 Reichsmarks. Complete technical specifications, the results of engine trials, and spare parts were included in the sale. Eighty percent of the material was to be provided within twelve months of the transfer, with the remainder to be provided within fifteen months. L√ºtzow was renamed \\"L\\", her original contract name, for the transfer to the Soviet Union. In February 1940, when the agreement was concluded, L√ºtzow was fitting-out in Bremen. Her main battery guns had been transferred to the German army and placed on railway mountings; they had to be dismantled and returned to Bremen. The ship was then towed to Leningrad on 15 April by a private German towing company. The two navies agreed that Germany would be responsible for naval escort, which included destroyers and smaller vessels. Rear Admiral Otto Feige was placed in command of the operation. Feige then led an advisory commission assigned to assist the Soviet effort to complete the ship. At the time the ship arrived in Leningrad, only the two forward gun turrets had been installed and the bridge superstructure was incomplete. The only secondary guns installed were the 3.7 cm anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet Navy renamed the ship Petropavlovsk on 25 September 1940, and designated the construction effort to complete the ship Projekt 83. The vessel's design provided the basis for a planned heavy cruiser, designated Projekt 82, although this ship was canceled before work began. Training for the Soviet crew of the ship proved to be contentious; the Soviets wanted their personnel trained in Germany, while the Germans preferred sending instructors to the Soviet Union. Language barriers and inexperience with international training missions also hampered the training effort. Sea trials for Petropavlovsk were scheduled to begin some time in late 1941, and according to the training program, the Soviet crew would not begin training until a month before the trials. It was decided that Soviet officers would train at German naval schools in the Fall of 1941, and that five officers would train aboard Seydlitz when the ship was commissioned for trials. German instructors would also be sent to Leningrad to train engine-room personnel. At the time of the commissioning of Petropavlovsk, the relevant German training and technical manuals would be sent to the Soviet Navy, albeit in German only. By the time Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Petropavlovsk was still incomplete. She was nevertheless used as a floating battery in the defense of Leningrad in August of that year. Several other ships, including the cruiser , joined Petropavlovsk in shelling the advancing Germans. On 7 September, the ship fired on German forces encircling the city; she fired forty salvos from her forward main battery turrets‚Äîthe only two operational‚Äîexpending some 700 rounds of ammunition during the attack. On 17 September 1941, the ship was disabled by German heavy artillery; after being hit 53 times, the ship was forced to beach herself to avoid sinking. On 4 April 1942, the I Fliegerkorps launched a major attack on the Soviet naval forces in Leningrad: 62 Ju 87s, 33 Ju 88s, and 37 He 111s struck the ships in the harbor. Petropavlovsk was hit once (credited by Hans-Ulrich Rudel), suffering serious damage, and sunk. The Soviet Navy raised the ship on 17 September 1942 and towed her to the Neva where she was repaired. Renamed Tallinn in 1943, the ship returned to service to support the Soviet counter- offensive to relieve the Siege of Leningrad in 1944. The ship was never completed, and was used as a stationary training ship after the end of the war. She was later used as a floating barracks in the Neva, and renamed Dniepr in 1953. The date of her disposal is uncertain; Erich Gr√∂ner reports the ship survived until being broken up for scrap in 1960, while Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships states that the vessel was scrapped in 1958‚Äì1959. Tobias Philbin reports that the ship was broken up in 1953.

The regiment and it colors were captured, along with much of Govan's Brigade at the Battle of Jonesboro, Georgia, on Sept. 1, 1864. Due to a special cartel between Union General Sherman and Confederate General John B. Hood, the unit was quickly paroled and exchanged for Union prisoner held at Andersonville Prison. The regiment re-entered service approximately a month later. Franklin-Nashville Campaign The regiment and the rest of Govan's Brigade was released in time to participate in General John B. Hood's disastrous Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Due to the appalling losses suffered by Govan's Brigade during the Atlanta Campaign, the 1st/15th, 5th/13th and 2nd/24th Arkansas Regiments were consolidated into one regiment, which was commanded by Colonel Peter Green of the 5th/13th (specifically of the 5th).

Description The bantam sunfish is dark in color with around ten vertical stripes visible along each flank. The lower jaw protrudes noticeably beyond the upper. Distribution and habitat The northern and southern boundaries for the bantam sunfish coincide fairly heavily with the former Mississippi Embayment from southern Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. As for the eastern and western boundaries, the bantam sunfish occurs along the Gulf Coast from Eagle Lake (in the Colorado River drainage) in Texas east through the Biloxi River system in Mississippi. The species is common only in a few states. These states include Louisiana where the fish resides statewide,Douglas, N. H. 1974. Freshwater fishes of Louisiana.

The bantam sunfish is also known to occur, less commonly, in parts of extreme southwestern Illinois, the Bootheel of Missouri, McCurtain County in Oklahoma, and some Mississippi and Gulf Coast drainages of the State of Mississippi.

M. et al. 1996. Selected Illinois fishes in jeopardy: New records and state evaluations. Transactions of the Illinois State Academy of Science. 89:169-186. Previous collections in the Cache River drainage failed to produce any bantam sunfish.Zeman, D. K. and B. M. Burr, 2004. Conservation Assessment for Bantam Sunfish (Lepomis symmetricus). USDA Forest Service. Ecology One study of the gut contents of wild-caught bantam sunfish revealed a diverse diet dominated by gastropods, odonate larvae, and micro-crustaceans. Bantam sunfish individuals of less than 21mm in length fed primarily upon aquatic Hemiptera, micro-crustaceans, and chironomids, while individuals of more than 40 mm in length commonly ate gastropods, amphipods, and larger dipteran larvae. Bantam sunfish of all size classes regularly consumed dragonfly larvae. The bantam sunfish has no known predators. Many predatory fish coexist in the habitat of bantam sunfish; however, predation has not been documented in literature reports. One extensive study at Wolf Lake, Illinois found no evidence of predation on the bantam sunfish. Gut analysis of potential predators, including largemouth bass, black crappie, white crappie, warmouth, bluegill, and yellow bullhead revealed a lack of predation on bantam sunfish. The bantam sunfish typically inhabits sloughs, oxbows, ponds, backwaters, lakes, and swamps. The vegetated margins of these environments are dominated by spatterdock, American lotus, broadleaf arrowhead, coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum), and duckweed (Lemna spp.) and are the preferred habitat for this fish. Substrates commonly consist of detritus, mud, and silt, with some sand. Environmental degradation caused by anthropogenic disturbance, particularly drainage of wetlands, is probably the greatest threat to the persistence of bantam sunfish in the wild. Wetlands and swamps have been channelized, dredged, drained, and converted to croplands.Fletcher, D. E. and B. M. Burr. 1992.

Over- collection for scientific research and educational purposes could become a problem given the bantam sunfish's short lifespan. Life history The typical spawning period for the species throughout its range is from mid-April to early June. Only large males at least one year and 40 mm in length appear to be sexually mature and do most of the spawning. Females become sexually mature at one year of age; these individuals may be as short as 34 mm in length. However, the largest females develop the earliest mature ova and probably contribute most to the spawning effort. There is little published data on the nest associates, nest sites and nesting behavior of the bantam sunfish in the wild. One of the few accounts is from Robinson;Robison, H. W. 1975.

Arkansas Academy of Science Proceedings 29:54-56 at 56. observations were made in a roadside pool in Saline County, Arkansas, where bantam sunfish had recently spawned in depressions in the mud and leaf litter substrate. Conservation Environmental degradation caused by anthropogenic disturbance, particularly drainage of wetlands, is probably the greatest threat to the bantam sunfish. \\"We are not aware of any current management activities being employed in any states focusing on populations of L. symmetricus, except that Illinois is apparently planning possible introduction of the species back into its historic range on the Illinois River (probably backwaters or oxbow lakes) near Pekin...We are not aware of any past or current conservation activities being employed in any states focusing on populations of L. symmetricus, except for its inclusion on State lists of endangered/threatened or special concern species\\". Limited information on the spawning and nesting habits of bantam sunfish in the wild make it near impossible to determine if populations are reproducing at a sustainable level.

The album was released on September 6, 2011 through Vagrant Records.  Recording and production  Thrice entered Red Bull Studios in early May 2011 with producer Dave Schiffman. The group had previously worked with Schiffman on 2005's Vheissu as an audio engineer, and on 2009's Beggars as a mixer. Thrice also previously used Red Bull Studios to record their acoustic live EP The MySpace Transmissions in 2007. When Thrice presented Schiffman with the demos they had been working on, his initial reaction was that the group was trying to make a grunge album. According to vocalist Dustin Kensrue, this was not their intention, and the finished product after production sounded \\"kind of bigger and meaner than the demos.\\" Both musically and production-wise, the group's previous album Beggars was a \\"stripped-down\\" record, and Thrice wanted Major/Minor to sound \\"bigger and in-your-face\\" without sounding \\"smashed and oversaturated.\\" Kensrue also noted that Schiffman joined the album process later than a producer normally would to help record an album, and that his input was minimal. He said: After the recording for Major/Minor had been completed, Thrice returned to their home studio to record \\"two or three\\" additional tracks to be used as B-sides. The home studio was also used to record Thrice's 2007/2008 albums The Alchemy Index Vols. I & II and The Alchemy Index Vols. III & IV, and Beggars.  Release and promotion  Major/Minor was initially released in a double LP vinyl record format on September 6, 2011 through Vagrant Records. The gatefold vinyl edition came with additional liner notes from the band members and the first pressing was limited to 4,000 copies. Two weeks later, on September 20 in the US and September 19 in the UK, Major/Minor was released in CD and digital download formats. Pre-orders for the album received an instant download of an acoustic version of \\"Anthology\\". The iTunes version of Major/Minor comes with an acoustic version of \\"Yellow Belly,\\" and pre-orders through the store placed before the official release date exclusively received an acoustic version of \\"Promises.\\" In July 2011, Thrice offered a free download of the opening track \\"Yellow Belly\\" through the website ChinaShop. The rush of traffic to the website caused the site to crash, and the song was subsequently uploaded to SoundCloud. \\"Yellow Belly\\" was previously debuted live at The Bamboozle festival in April 2011. In August 2011, an acoustic version of \\"Anthology,\\" and a lyric video for \\"Promises\\" were posted online. Beginning on September 7 and lasting until the day of the digital/CD release, Thrice posted one new song from Major/Minor each weekday for online streaming. \\"Promises\\" impacted radio on October 4, 2011.  Supporting tours  Thrice's first headlining tour in support of Major/Minor ran from September 30 to November 11, 2011 and featured openers La Dispute, Moving Mountains and O'Brother. Kylesa was originally intended to be an opener for this tour, but announced they would not be able to perform due to an illness in the family several months before the tour began.  Reception  Critical response Upon its release, Major/Minor was met with critical acclaim, earning an average score of 82 based on 10 reviews from Metacritic. In a positive review, Raziq Rauf of BBC Music praised the production of the album, stating that \\"there‚Äôs a simplicity to the music and songs that allows the listener to enjoy them at a very elemental level.\\" With a four out of five rating, Punknews praised the grunge influence of the album, comparing their sound to \\"an authentic 1990s Pearl Jam/Soundgarden creation.\\" IGN labeled the album as \\"one of the strongest rock efforts of the year,\\" with reviewer Chris Grischow praising Kensrue's vocals on \\"Yellow Belly\\", \\"Blinded\\", \\"Promises\\", \\"Cataract\\" and \\"Anthology\\".

VSM allows individuals to view themselves being successful, acting appropriately, or performing new tasks. Peter Dowrick, a key researcher in the development of self-modeling, described two forms of VSM, feedforward and self-review. Self-review involves someone with a relatively well developed skill watching examples of best performance.Dowrick, P. W. & Biggs, J. (1983), Using Video: Psychological and social applications (1st ed.), New York: Wiley A good example of this is the procedure used by Laura Wilkinson, gold medal platform diver, prior to every meet. In an interview after her gold medal performance, she was asked how she prepares for competition.National Broadcasting Corporation (2000, September, 24). Laura Wilkinson gold medal interview - Sydney games. New York: NY. She said that she watches a video that consists of her best dives along with encouragement from family and coaches. Self-review is mainly used in sports training as a form of visual imaging.Buggey, T. (2009). Seeing is Believing: Self-modeling Applications with Children with Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities. Baltimore; Woodbine House. Feedforward, on the other hand, is used with people who do not have a skill or when a new skill is emerging. Thus, feedforward is the method most often used in instructional or clinical settings. Because Feedforward involves new skills or behaviors performed by the viewer, it usually requires some degree of video editing to make it appear that the viewer is performing in an advanced manner. The term feedforward can be contrasted with the more traditional term feedback as it relates to receiving information about performance. Feedback allows people to see how they are doing. Feedforward allows them to see how they could be performing; a future self. Feedforward is mainly used in education and therapy circles and mainly with children with disabilities. It has been found to be especially effective with children with autism who tend to be visual learners and who seem to attend better to monitors than to live models.Bauman, M. L. (1999). Autism: Clinical features and neurological observations. In Helen Tager- Flusberg (Ed.) Neurological Disorders (pp. 383-399). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. Background Research across an array of behaviors and many types of disabilities has been ongoing since 1970 with very positive results. Researchers report that changes occur rapidly, there is good maintenance, and that changes generalize across settings.Bellini, S. & Akullian, J., (2007). A meta-analysis of video modeling and video self-modeling interventions for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Exceptional Children, 73, 261-284. Adoption by educators and therapists has lagged behind the research possibly because of the technology requirements for editing videos. The advent of user-friendly editing software such as iMovie and Movie Maker has gone a long way in solving that problem. Another reason that the use of VSM seems to be gathering momentum is an article that appeared in 2007 by Scott Bellini and Jennifer Akulian. These researchers conducted a meta- analyses of all forms of video modeling and concluded that both peer and self- modeling met the Council for Exceptional Children's requirements for research- based methods. Self-modeling has several attributes that sets it apart as a good tool to use with children with disabilities. It uses only positive imagery which makes it fit well into most positive behavior support plans. Effects of VSM should be seen almost immediately. If change is not seen after two or three viewings, one can move quickly to an alternate intervention. Finally, there appears to be no real down-side to the method. No damage is done if it does not work for an individual. As Buggey states in his book, the only tangible outcome when no results are seen is that the person ends up with a flattering video of him or herself. In his book, Seeing is Believing, Tom Buggey lists three major ways video footage can be collected and compiled into a feedforward video: # Imitation ‚Äì Particularly useful with language skills. Children are prompted to say words or phrases. Words can be new or rarely used and phrases and sentences can be longer or more complex than presently used. Individual words can even be extracted from videos using video editing software and joined into sentences. # Role playing ‚Äì Particularly useful for social skills. Children act out scenes of proper behavior that are usually challenging for them. For example, the triggers of tantrums can be determined and then each trigger can become a scene in the VSM video ‚Äì with the person performing appropriate alternative behaviors rather than tantruming. # Let the camera roll to capture rare behaviors ‚Äì typically used with persons who cannot imitate or follow directions. This can be very time-consuming; however, it has been used effectively for eating problems. A child can be filmed during several lunch periods and best examples of appropriate eating (such as putting food to mouth) can be extracted and combined into a feedforward movie.  Caveats  Although VSM has shown overwhelming success with a range of ages and types of disabilities it has had problematic results with children under 4 yrsBuggey, T. (2016). Facilitating social initiations with young preschoolers with autism using self-modeling: A replication. Focus on Autism and Other DisabilitiesClark, E., Beck, D., Sloane, H., Goldsmith, D., Jenson, W., Bowen, J., Kehle, T. (1993). Self-Modeling with preschoolers. School Psychology International, 14, 83-89. and with persons with very severe cognitive disabilities (although it has been successful with children with severe autism).Buggey, T., Hoomes, G., Williams, S. & Sherberger, B. (2010). Facilitating social initiations with preschoolers with autism using self- modeling. Focus on Autism and Other Disabilities. Users must use caution to not depict behavior that is far beyond the viewer's ability. Showing skills beyond the reach of individuals can cause frustration and work counter to the purpose of VSM. Both speech/language and physical or occupational therapists need to be consulted when the skills needing to be addressed fall within their areas of expertise. (update: 2017. Studies with children under the age of 4 were restricted to the training of social skills. However, The Dept. of Education in Minnesota (MDOE) funded a training project for its Birth to 3 caregivers in 2013. Participants were trained in the use of VSM and were required to record and report results to a MDOE supervisor. Over 90 personnel were trained and 87 submitted results. All but 3 reported positive results. The skills addressed were mainly functional and language-based. Because none of these cases involved training social interaction skills, it was hypothesized that use of VSM with children under 4 [as young as 2 yrs. 1 mo.] was practical for certain behaviors.Grove, V. & Buggey, T. (2014). The Minnesota Project: VSM use in Early Intervention. The Division of Early Childhood (CEC) Annual Conference. St. Louis, MO.) Users should also be aware of the differences between self-modeling and self-observation. While self- modeling involves edited videos depicting only positive imagery, self- observation involves watching raw, unedited footage of behavior. The classic example of self-observation is watching game films in sports. Much can be gained by using self-observation; however, there is a risk that if behaviors viewed are too negative (e.g. a lineman missing blocking assignments 60% of the time) it could adversely affect self-confidence, and thus the performance of the viewer. Buggey suggests that use of self-observation with children with disabilities should be used with extreme caution.  Theory behind self- modeling  Many self-modeling researchers point to Albert Bandura's studiesBandura, A. (1994). Self-efficacy. In V. S. Ramachaudran (Ed.), Encyclopedia of human behavior (Vol. 4, pp. 71-81). New York: Academic Press. on social learning as key to the understanding of the effectiveness of VSM. Bandura made two fundamental findings that relate directly to self modeling. The first is that the best models are those as close to the viewer as possible in all attributes including ability. You cannot get closer than when the model and viewer are the same person with only a slight change in ability. The other finding involves self-efficacy, the belief that one can succeed at a task. Bandura found that the higher the belief in success, the higher the success rate. Self-modeling allows children to see themselves succeeding, and increases self-efficacy (as long as the new behavior is attainable and developmentally appropriate). One of the reasons VSM may work so well with social behaviors may have been uncovered by Thomas Kehle and colleagues.Kehle, T. J., Bray, M. A., Margiano, S. G., Theodore, L. A., & Zhou, Z. (2002). Self- modeling as an effective intervention for students with serious emotional disturbance: Are we modifying children's memories? Psychology in the Schools, 39, 203-207. While working with children with emotional disorders who had had VSM intervention, they noticed that clients had difficulty remembering negative behaviors during exit interviews. They hypothesized that these individual were not only getting new memories based on VSM experiences, but they were also supplanting memories of the old behaviors. Their hypothesis was substantiated in the 2002 study. Their findings are preliminary and there have not been any published replications, but if substantiated, it raises both interesting methodological and ethical issues.  Possible applications  Any behavior that can be observed, and thus filmed, can be a subject of a self- modeling video. In their meta-analysis article, Bellini and Akulian identified behaviors that were addressed in studies they evaluated. These include: # Cognitive skills such as math computation # Selective mutism # Language skills # Functional skills such as making beds or getting dressed # Physical skills such as swimming or lifting legs when walking # Depression # Stuttering # Oral reading fluency References  External links  * Educational site dedicated to VSM with videos, power point, and other resources * Video Futures Project at Univ. of Hawai'i Manoa * Video modeling for Autism * Council for Exceptional Children * Leveraging Technology for Video Self Modeling, Angie Sterling-Orth * https://pacificnwpublish.com/products/Picture-Perfect.html Category:Autism Category:Therapy Category:Special education ","title":"Video self-modeling"},{"id":"32487749","text":"The Roman de la Rose Digital Library (Rose DL) is a joint project of the Sheridan Libraries of the Johns Hopkins University and the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. The goal of the Rose DL is to create an online library of all manuscripts containing the 13th-century poem Roman de la Rose. The library currently displays digital surrogates of more than 140 Roman de la Rose manuscripts, and the collection continues to grow. The entire collection is freely available to the public for scholarly research and personal use. History This project first began in 1996 when Stephen G. Nichols, James M. Beall Professor of French and Chair of the Romance Languages and Literatures Department at Johns Hopkins University, approached staff at the Milton S. Eisenhower Library about digitizing Roman de la Rose manuscripts for teaching purposes. After receiving funding from Ameritech Library Services, the Getty Grant Program, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, and the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, the Eisenhower Library created the prototype Roman de la Rose: Digital Surrogates of Medieval Manuscripts, which came to include six Rose manuscripts from various libraries in the US and UK. The original library contained manuscripts from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, the Morgan Library in New York, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and the Bodleian Library in Oxford. In 2007, the Biblioth√®que nationale de France and the Rose DL began a partnership to digitize all the Rose manuscripts held in Paris and in municipal and university libraries in France for the site. With funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, this joint project makes available about half of the roughly 300 Rose manuscripts known to be extant. Features All page images in the digital library may be viewed in a page turner application or in an image browsing format. Researchers may pan on a page or zoom down to a high degree of magnification. In addition to the images themselves, the Rose DL provides metadata that supports the research process. Many of the manuscripts have detailed manuscript descriptions that provide information about the history of the manuscript and about its physical characteristics such as binding, quire structure, material, and decoration. Full transcriptions exist for a few manuscripts and illustration descriptions are available for many. It is often difficult to find the same narrative section in multiple manuscripts since they differ in line length, number of columns, and number of lines on a leaf. To get around this, the Rose DL includes a narrative sections tool that approximates the start and finish of each section. These are usually accurate to within two columns.

The autonomous region experienced protests that were concurrent with the 2011 Iraqi protests and the wider Arab Spring. The Iraqi Kurdish protests were also related to the 2011 Kurdish protests in Turkey and the 2011‚Äì2012 Iranian protests, as well as the civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War. Background Inspired by the Arab Spring, the Movement for Change, a major opposition party, called for the resignation of the Cabinet and the disbanding of the Kurdistan Regional Government. The movement was criticized by ruling and opposition parties for causing unnecessary unrest. Qubad Talabani said that there was no need for the government to disband because \\"unlike Tunisia and Egypt, there is an open political process with a viable opposition in Kurdistan.\\" Despite this criticism, the Movement for Change continued to organise demonstrations. Protests Sulaymaniyah Protests erupted in the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan, mainly in the city of Sulaimaniya where a crowd of 3000 protesters gathered against corruption and social injustice. The demonstrations turned violent when a group of protesters tried to storm the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party and threw rocks at the building. The security guards responded by shooting into the crowd several times to disperse them during which two people died and 47 were wounded. The Movement for Change took responsibility for the demonstrations but said it had nothing to do with the storming of the building and condemned the attack on the headquarters. In the following weeks the demonstration expanded and reached a height of 7000 protesters. A sit-in demonstration was held and demonstrators occupied the Freedom Square (Saray Azadi in Kurdish) in Sulaymaniyah. About 400 protesters gathered in Sulaimaniya's central square, but at least 50 were hurt when some demonstrators allegedly began to attack police with sticks and stones, leading to a riot. Religious leaders and other opposition parties joined the protesters Security forces clashed with protesters several times and both sides took casualties resulting in the dead of ten people Crackdown On 19 April security forces stormed the main square of Sulaimaniya to impose order and prevent further demonstrations. Security forces were successful in quelling demonstrations. Security forced were deployed all around the province making for an uneasy peace between authorities and civilians. Parliament The opposition called for a motion of no confidence against the cabinet of prime minister Barham Salih. The motion was rejected with 67 to 28. The opposition said it didn't expect the motion to pass but that it wanted to give a symbolic gesture. Barham Salih responded by saying that the debate \\"offered opportunity to present achievements, challenges& agenda for expanding reforms. [We] Must listen to voices of people.\\" Reaction * Massoud Barzani: After a week of protests the Kurdistan Regional President Massoud Barzani responded to the protesters saying everyone has the right to protest as long as it is peaceful. * Jalal Talabani: The Iraqi President,whose party relies on the city of Sulaymaniyah for support, said in an interview that the \\"crowd's demands are inspirational and legitimate\\". * Amnesty International: Amnesty International called for an end to the crackdown saying: \\"Iraqi authorities must end the use of intimidation and violence against those Iraqis peacefully calling for political and economic reforms\\". * Human Rights Watch: HRW criticized the authorities saying: \\"In a time when the Middle East is erupting in demands to end repression, the Kurdish authorities are trying to stifle and intimidate critical journalism. \\" Regional connections Kurdish protesters in Iraqi Kurdistan have expressed solidarity with brethren in Syria and Turkey, and the relative autonomy of the region has helped it to function as a sort of sanctuary for Kurdish leaders and refugees. After the independence of South Sudan in East Africa, some Iraqi Kurds suggested that the example of the South Sudanese peacefully and democratically gaining independence from Arab- dominated Sudan should be a model for the Kurdish population in the Middle East.

The virtual world can be explored in a free-camera mode as well as in vehicles such as planes, boats and cars. It also features a first person walking mode. For the mirror world real world data was used - ingame the user can blend in an embedded Google Maps of real Earth that is synchronized with the current camera position. Since June 2013 Anteworld provides support for Oculus Rift. Furthermore, user-made objects such as houses and vehicles can be spawned and used in the sandbox game. While the tech-demo is free some features require an upgrade to the $15 full version. An accompanying novella that is loosely tied to the game written by C. Shawn Smith is planned as well.  Middle-Earth DEM Project  In 2013 a separate non-profit motivated group of hobbyists released a first version of terrain data of Middle-Earth compiled for Outerra. The goal of this digital elevation model project, which was launched by Oshyan Greene and Carl Lingard in 2006, is what they summarize as a \\"living, breathing Middle Earth\\" - a highly detailed model which includes rivers, vegetation, buildings, roads and subterranean features. The sources for the maps include Tolkien's maps (such as the ones in The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion), Strachey's Journeys of Frodo, Fonstad's The Atlas of Middle- earth, the locations used in Peter Jackson's movies as well as fan made maps.  Virtual Mars  In February 2014 the developers announced ongoing development, which was planned since October 2009, to add another planet to the two already existing ones (Earth and the fictional Middle Earth) - Mars.

St. Nicholas‚Äôs Church and graveyard are in the town, where the earthly remains of St. Nicholas of Myra are said to be buried. Belmore House stands at the top of the town.  History  View of St Nicholas Church from Belmore House * The lost town of Newtown Jerpoint. It was founded by either Earl Marshall or Griffin Fitzwilliam in 12th centuryheritageconservationplan/NewtonJerpoint, p.26 where the main crossing of the River Nore was formed by a toll bridge, giving Jerpoint its name as it means 'Nore bridge'.heritageconservationplan/NewtonJerpoint, p.17 * It was a vibrant town, with approx 27 dwelling houses, a court house, woollen mill, a tannery, a brewery and reputed to have had 14 taverns. * Newtown Jerpoint lasted at least into the 17th century, but eventually declined, perhaps from the loss of its bridge and the re-routing of the road.heritageconservationplan/NewtonJerpoint,3.2 p.26 Its visible remains and its close proximity to one of Ireland‚Äôs best-known and well-preserved Cistercian abbeys makes Newtown Jerpoint one of the most important sites in the study of medieval settlements in Ireland.heritageconservationplan/NewtonJerpoint,p.11 * The ruins of St Nicholas‚Äô medieval parish church dates from the 12th to the 13th century, with a late medieval rood gallery and a tower where the parish priest would have resided. * Belmore House was commissioned as a hunting lodge by Earl Belmore in the 18th century and designed by the Irish architect Sir Richard Morrison. An extension of the house was planned as a square villa at the east end of the house with the rest of the house to become a service wing, but it was never built.heritageconservationplan/NewtonJerpoint, p.83 The Earl of Belmore's main residence was Castle Coole, in Co. Fermanagh  Legends  Tomb of St Nicholas (Santa Claus) St. Nicholas who inspired the legend of Santa Claus is believed to have been buried in Newtown Jerpoint some 800 years ago. The grave slab features a cleric with the heads of two knights behind each shoulder and is said to be St Nicholas and the heads, the two crusaders who, so the story goes, brought Nicholas' remains back to Ireland. Evidence lends some possible credence to this tale as the Normans in Kilkenny were keen collectors of religious relics. And it is known that Norman knights participated in the Holy Land Crusades Another version of the story tells of a French family, the de Frainets, who removed Nicholas' remains from Myra to Bari, Italy, in 1169 when Bari was under the Normans. The de Frainets were crusaders to the Holy Land and also owned land in Thomastown, Ireland. After the Normans were forced out of Bari, the de Frainets moved to Nice, France, taking the relics with them. When the Normans lost power in France, Nicholas de Frainet moved to Ireland. This story has the relics being buried in Jerpoint in 1200.http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/ireland/  Archaeology  View of the Lost Town of Newtown Jerpoint A survey was commissioned in 2007 by the Heritage Council Ireland and the Discovery Programme that used Lidar to show the extent of Newtown Jerpoint. \\"One of Ireland‚Äôs best surviving examples of a deserted 12th Century Medieval Town\\" .......

Background Tihomir's predecessor ƒåaslav (r. 927‚Äì960) had united several Slavic tribes, expanding Serbia which then extended between the shores of the Adriatic Sea, the Sava river and the Morava valley. The Magyars led by Kisa invaded Bosnia. The Serbian army advanced and met them on the banks of river Drina, in the Drina ≈æupania, downstream from present-day Foƒça. The Magyars were decisively defeated, and Kisa was killed by Tihomir. Due to his heroism, ƒåaslav appointed Tihomir Duke of Drina and gave him his daughter in marriage. Succession to Ra≈°ka Kisa's widow asked the Magyar leaders to give her an army for revenge. With an \\"unknown number\\" of troops, the widow returned and surprised ƒåaslav at Syrmia. The Magyars attack the Serbs in the night, capturing ƒåaslav and all of his male relatives. On the command of Kisa's widow, all the prisoners were bound by their hands and feet and thrown into the Sava river. This event is dated to around 960 or thereafter, as 'De Administrando Imperio' does not mention his death. Through his marriage with ƒåaslav's daughter, Tihomir inherited the crownland of Ra≈°ka. Later annexation of Ra≈°ka by Byzantium Tihomir's reign ended around 969. The Catepanate of Ras was established between 971‚Äì976, during the rule of John Tzimiskes (r. 969‚Äì976). A seal of a strategos of Ras has been dated to Tzimiskes' reign, making it possible for Tzimiskes' predecessor Nikephoros II Phokas to have established rule over Ra≈°ka. The protospatharios and katepano of Ras was a Byzantine governor named John. Data on the katepano of Ras during Tzimiskes' reign is missing. Byzantine military presence ended soon thereafter with the wars with Bulgaria, and was re-established only ca. 1018 with the short-lived Theme of Sirmium, which however did not extend much into Ra≈°ka.

The Wartburg was founded in 1866 as an orphanage and farm school and began serving older adults in 1898. As the foster care system took hold in the mid-1900s, the Wartburg gradually phased out the orphanage and by 1979, its focus was solely on serving the elderly. History The Wartburg Orphans‚Äô Farm School was established in 1866 by a Lutheran minister, Reverend William Passavant, with an initial gift of $30,000 from New York sugar refiner Peter Moller.Das Buch der Deutschen in America: Pages 383 - 387. Translation by Susan Kriegbaum-Hanks. Buffalo & Erie County Public Library, Buffalo NY. http://www.archivaria.com/BdDA/BdDA5.html Originally, Moller had planned to use the funds to erect a lavish memorial for his son, whom he had lost in the American Civil War. However, Reverend Passavant, who had previously founded The Orphan‚Äôs Home and Farm School in Zelienople, Pennsylvania, convinced Moller of the need for a similar orphanage in New York to help the great number of children left fatherless by the Civil War. Moller agreed and donated the $30,000 to help fund the new orphanage. With advisement from Reverend G.C. Holls, headmaster of the Zelienople orphanage and Sister Elizabeth, a nun affiliated with a similar orphanage in Rochester, Pennsylvania, Reverend Passavant searched for an appropriate property for the new orphanage. Ultimately, they settled on 125 acres of land in Pelham, New York purchased from The Lutheran Committee for Charitable Concerns. On a visit to the property, Passavant was believed to comment that ‚ÄúThis is something like the site of The Wartburg where Luther translated the New Testament,‚Äù of which Pastor Holls, later hired as the first director of The Wartburg, replied with ‚ÄúThen we will call it The Wartburg.‚ÄùThe Wartburg Castle. Sacred Destinations The Wartburg was originally incorporated under the name ‚ÄúDeaconess Institution of the State of New York.‚Äù However, in 1884, a state charter was obtained, officially naming it ‚ÄúThe Wartburg Orphans‚Äô Farm School of the Evangelical Lutheran Church‚Äù.

By 1916, he was placed in Thessaloniki as the commander of a mountain artillery regiment. He played a major role in the September 1916 coup d'√©tat by the Venizelist \\"Movement of National Defence\\", and served as head of the Artillery Directorate in the subsequent National Defence government. In 1918 he was posted to Bern as Greek military attach√© to Switzerland. He returned to Greece in 1919 to assume command of the Xanthi Division during the occupation of Western Thrace. In 1920, he led his division to a landing on Bandirma during the Greek offensive against the Kemalists, and shortly after in the occupation of Eastern Thrace, against the local Turkish forces of Cafer Tayyar. Following the Greek defeat in Anatolia by the Kemalists in August 1922, he chaired the commission of inquiry into the reasons for the defeat.

The character appears in the NEW-GEN comic books. Created by Chris Matonti, J.D. Matonti, and Julia Coppola, he first appeared in NEW-GEN #1 (2010). He is the founder and leader of the A.P.N.G., and the leading scientific mind in the field of nanotechnology on the world of New-Gen.http://www.comicvine.com/gabriel/29-69829/ Fictional Character Biography Utopia and Deadalus' Betrayal Gabriel's long career in the creation and application of various kinds of nanotechnology on the world of New-Gen gained him a tremendous amount of success and admiration from the general populace. Through his technological advancements and careful cooperation with his wife, Thea (a guardian of the natural world), Gabriel revolutionized life on New-Gen, creating an almost utopian society. After taking on Sylvester Deadalus as an apprentice, Gabriel was able to create even more ways to make the quality of life more harmonious and comfortable for the general populace. However, unbeknownst to his mentor, Deadalus began to experiment on living things, pushing the envelope of nanotechnology and enhancing his subjects in unnatural ways. When Gabriel found out about this, he was furious and told Deadalus to stop immediately. However, Deadalus released onto the public of New-Gen, a swarm of nanobots he designed to alter the biological structure of those they infected. After the nanobots infected several children, mutating their bodies rapidly and giving them superpowers, Gabriel apprehended Deadalus and banished him to the underworld as punishment. Gabriel then sent his twin sons, Sean and Chris, to present-day New York City on Earth, to protect them from further attacks by Deadalus. Before he sent them there, Gabriel expressed concern that their bodies had also been affected by Deadalus' nanobot infestation.NEW-GEN #1 Gabriel banishing Deadalus to the underworld. Training the A.P.N.G. After taking in the children whose bodies were affected by Deadalus' nanobots, Gabriel and Thea began to train them in the responsible use of their powers, with the end goal of forming a super-powered team to combat against those who would seek to threaten the lives of the innocent. Gabriel sent the oldest and best trained warrior, Mini and a combat robot, the Horus, to dispatch Deadalus after he resurfaced in ancient Crete and started wreaking havoc. When Mini had defeated Deadalus, Gabriel commanded Mini to banish Deadalus again, rather than kill him.NEW-GEN #2 Periodically, Gabriel checked in on his twin sons on Earth, who grew up not knowing their true father or mother. Thea often chastised Gabriel for the decision to send them to Earth, although she only did so privately, away from the eyes of the students.NEW-GEN #3 Battle with Sly When Deadalus emerged from the underworld onto Zadaar III, transformed by microbots into the insane and brutal Sly, Gabriel sent Mini to dispatch him again. However, it became evident very quickly that Mini was not strong enough to take out Sly's entire army of enhanced MetalMites by himself, so Gabriel teleported the remaining members of the team to help. As he watched Mini, Flyer, Gazelle, Diamond, and Roboduck fight Sly from his command center on New-Gen, Gabriel also noticed his sons having fitful visions of the battle. Gabriel prepared to depart and join the fray himself, carrying with him six green orbs containing highly advanced nanotechnology.NEW-GEN #5 Just before Gabriel arrived Sly shot the A.P.N.G. with a nanobot killing energy blast, leaving them powerless and weak. Gabriel, enraged, teleported to the battle and gave each member of the A.P.N.G. one of the green orbs, each of which transformed into a nano-glove, containing nanobots which restore their powers and strength. Gabriel then engaged Sly one on one, using his mastery of his own nanobot-given powers. After being overwhelmed at first, Gabriel fought back and eventually overcame Sly, banishing him for the third time to the underworld.NEW-GEN #6 Powers, abilities, and equipment Gabriel's powers stem from his complete mastery of the nanotechnology he has implanted within himself. He possess superhuman strength, the ability to emit powerful energy blasts, and telekinetic abilities (and by extension, flight).NEW-GEN #5 He is also able to teleport himself and others to any point in time and space instantaneously.NEW-GEN #1 Gabriel also possesses a genius level intellect, and regularly creates both nanobots and large robots to perform specific, complex tasks.NEW-GEN #1 He also possesses the Kane, a large blue rod composed of nanobots that he can change the shape of according to his will. It also seems to serve as a means for him to focus or augment his powers, as well as weapon in physical combat, at which Gabriel excels.NEW-GEN #5  References   External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20110707153446/http://apngenterprises.com/comic/characters- of-new-gen/ * http://www.comicvine.com/gabriel/29-69829/ ","title":"Gabriel (New-Gen)"},{"id":"32488214","text":"Pentaplatarthus is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Pentaplatarthrus schoutedeni Reichensperger, 1925 * Pentaplatarthrus bottegi Gestro, 1895 * Pentaplatarthrus dollmanni Wasmann, 1922 * Pentaplatarthrus focki Wasmann, 1919 * Pentaplatarthrus gestroi H.Kolbe, 1896 * Pentaplatarthrus natalensis Westwood, 1850 * Pentaplatarthrus paussoides Westwood, 1833 * Pentaplatarthrus vandamii Van De Poll, 1886 These are Ant nest beetles and are obligate myrmecophiles predatory on ant larvae and workers.

The first version was designed by Rudolph Kaiser and subsequent versions by Egon Scheibe.Simons, Martin, Sailplanes 1945-1965, (Ed: Eqip) p.162 Design and development The Zugvogel was designed with the goal of a simple and inexpensive, but high performance, open class competition glider, with quick assembly. It was developed through several variants before production ended after 100 had been completed. The aircraft is of mixed construction, with a welded steel tube fuselage covered in doped aircraft fabric covering, wooden framed tail surfaces covered in fabric and wooden wings. The span wing uses a NACA 63-616 airfoil at the wing root, changing to a NACA 63-614 section at the wing tip. The wing uses dive brakes for glidepath control. The nose is covered with fibreglass. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel. The Zugvogel IIIB was type certified in the United States on 6 May 1964. Zugvogel IIIAs operated in the US are in the Experimental - Racing/Exhibition category.

Changes in the catch per unit effort are inferred to signify changes to the target species' true abundance. A decreasing CPUE indicates overexploitation, while an unchanging CPUE indicates sustainable harvesting. CPUE has a number of advantages over other methods of measuring abundance. It does not interfere with routine harvesting operations, and data are easily collected. The data are also easy to analyse, even for non-specialists, in contrast to methods based on transects. This means that decisions about stock management can also be made by the people doing the harvesting. The best practice is to standardise the effort employed (e.g. number of traps or duration of searching), which controls for the reduction in catch size that often results from subsequent efforts. Although CPUE is a relative measure of abundance, it can be used to estimate absolute abundances. The main difficulty when using measures of CPUE is to define the unit of effort.

Design and development Designed by Prof. Dr. Tomislav Dragoviƒá at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Aero Engineering Institute, University of Belgrade, the Vuk-T was manufactured by FAJ Jastreb in Vr≈°ac entirely from fiberglass. After manufacture the gliders were first tested by the JRV and JNA before donation to state-sponsored aero clubs across the country. Permitted to do the following aerobatic manoeuvres: loop, stall turn, steep turn and spin, the Vuk-t is popular in flying clubs because it reminds club members about free flying, the free donation of planes to clubs by the army and general Yugoslavian nostalgia. The majority of surviving Vuk-t gliders fly with aero- clubs with few aircraft in private ownership and are expected to have a long life due to the high structural strength and ease of maintenance. One peculiar attribute of the VUK-T can be characterized by a whistling sound when flying, often described as the howl of a wolf, (vuk meaning wolf in some languages used by peoples of the former Yugoslavia).

Biggest successes  In 2006 and 2011 Meyer won the title at the National Championships in the Women‚Äôs category. She also placed 3rd in the Men's category in 2011. She finished the 2008 Riders Tour as second overall. During the last years Meyer became a regular figure in German Nations Cup teams. July 2010 saw her first appearance in a Nations Cup team at the CHIO Aachen. Immediately afterwards she was promoted to the German national squad A for show jumping riders.Kaderkorrekturen Springen: Janne- Friederike Meyer im Championatskader ‚Äì Christian Ahlmann ab August im B-Kader , Deutsche Reiterliche Vereinigung e.V., 16. Juli 2010. For the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games Meyer was nominated originally as a substitute. Because of an injury of another horse she could participate in both the team and individual event. With just four penalty points in the first round and a flawless second round, Meyer could contribute to the success of the German team winning the gold medal. Her biggest individual success so far was her victory in the Grand Prix of Aachen at the 2011 CHIO with Cellagon Lambrasco. Only a day earlier she won the \\"Best of Champions\\" class, participation in which is limited to the five highest ranked women and men in the world rankings plus the Olympic, World and European champions, with Holiday by Solitour. Later in 2011 Meyer (with Cellagon Lambrasco) was part of the German team that won the Gold medal at the FEI European Jumping Championships in Madrid. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Meyer failed to reach the final round of the individual competition, finishing in 41st place overall. The German team, together with Meyer, also failed to reach the second round of the team competition, finishing in a shared 10th place.

Life Baynes was born at Middleham, Yorkshire, and educated at Richmond Grammar School in the same county, under Anthony Temple. Proceeding to Trinity College, Cambridge, he graduated B.A. in 1777, gaining one of Dr. Smith's prizes for philosophy and the first medal for classics. In 1780 he took his M.A. Baynes was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1778 or 1779, and read law with Alan Chambre. In 1779 he was elected a fellow of Trinity, and remained one till his death. Besides practising as a special pleader, Baynes turned his attention to politics, and like his tutor, John Jebb, became a zealous whig. He joined the Constitutional Society of London, and took an active part in the meeting at York in 1779. At the general election of 1784 he supported the nomination of William Wilberforce for Yorkshire, and inveighed against the late coalition of Portland and Lord North. Shortly before his death Baynes, with the junior fellows of Trinity, memorialised the senior fellows and master on the irregular election of fellows, but they were only answered by a censure. The memorialists appealed to the lord chancellor as visitor of the college, and the censure was removed from the college books. Baynes died in London from a putrid fever, on 3 August 1787, and was buried by the side of his friend Dr. Jebb in Bunhill Fields. Works Baynes contributed political articles to the London Courant. He wrote (anonymously) political verses and translations from French and Greek poems; some of these were published in the European Magazine (xii. 240). He is mentioned by Andrew Kippis as supplying materials for the Biographia Britannica. The arch√¶ological epistle to Jeremiah Milles, on the Rowley poems was ascribed to Baynes, because it passed through his hands to the press; but he denied the authorship. Cannon in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests William Mason used Baynes to have it published.

He saw service during the Seven Years' War and the American War of Independence, being killed in action in a brief engagement prior to the Battle of the Saintes. Seven Years' War Bayne became a lieutenant on 5 April 1749; in 1755 he served in that rank on board HMS Torbay, in North American waters, with Admiral Edward Boscawen, and in November 1756 was advanced to the command of a sloop of war. In 1760 he was promoted to post captain and given command of the 44-gun , and served in that ship at the reduction of Martinique in 1762, and continued there aboard the frigate , under the command of Vice- Admiral George Brydges Rodney. American War of Independence After this he had no command till 1778, when he was appointed to the newly built 74-gun , and served in the Channel Fleet through 1779 and 1780. He afterwards went to the West Indies as part of the squadron with Sir Samuel Hood, and was present in the action off Fort Royal in Martinique on 29 April 1781, and in the action off the Chesapeake on 5 September. Owing to the faulty system of tactics then in vogue and almost compulsory, the Alfred had no active share in either of these battles, the circumstances of which were afterwards much discussed. On returning to the West Indies the Alfred was with Sir Samuel Hood at the Battle of Saint Kitts, where she accidentally fouled the frigate , cutting her down to the water, and losing her own bowsprit. This delayed the fleet at the very critical moment when Hood had proposed an unexpected attack on the French at anchor. No blame was attached to Captain Bayne for the accident, which was mainly due to the darkness of the night. Bayne quickly refitted his ship and resumed his station in the line, which won him credit, as did his distinguished conduct in the battle. When the fleet was reunited under the flag of Sir George Rodney, the Alfred continued under the immediate orders of Sir Samuel Hood, and with other ships of Hood's division was engaged in the partial action with the French on 9 April 1782, just prior to the Battle of the Saintes. It was little more than a distant interchange of fire between the respective vans; but one shot carried off Captain Bayne's leg about mid-thigh. Before a tourniquet could be applied, he was dead. To his memory, jointly with that of Captains William Blair and Lord Robert Manners, who were killed in the battle three days later, a national monument was placed in Westminster Abbey.

Its average elevation is above sea level and its total land area is 823 hectares. Mayrouba's inhabitants are almost predominantly Maronite Catholic. As of 2008, the village had a school with 50 pupils and seven businesses with over five employees. There are several Stone Age archaeological sites in the vicinity that have defined the location as the type site of the Mayroubian culture. Archaeology Mayrouba I Mayrouba I is east northeast of Junie by the way to Faraya. It is a large site on top of a plateau to the north of the village situated in sandstone at an altitude of approximately . It was discovered by Paulist Fathers from Harissa. Collections were made from the site by P.R. Gigues and various Jesuits including Maurice Tallon, Auguste Bergy, Francis Hours and Henri Fleisch. Fleisch admitted that it was not the best choice for a type site due to the possibility of mixed industries however he published it as a transitional site with successive occupations between peoples of the Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic.Fleisch, Henri., Les stations pr√©historiques de montagne au Liban, VI' Congr√®s de l'UlSPP (Rome, 1962) Finds of predominantly blue-grey Upper Jurassic flints included an emphasized Upper Paleolithic element with finds of two Emireh points by Lorraine Copeland and R.

She was among the first doctors in the United States to recognize the AIDS epidemic of the early 1980s; she co- authored the first article linking AIDS with Kaposi's sarcoma. Laubenstein was raised in Barrington, Rhode Island, where a childhood bout of polio left her paraplegic and using a wheelchair for the rest of her life. She graduated from Barnard College in 1969 and received her medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, where she specialized in hematology and oncology. She went on to become a clinical professor before leaving to focus on treating AIDS patients in her private practice. In addition to her medical work, she was an outspoken AIDS activist and co-founded a non-profit organization, Multitasking, which provided employment to people with AIDS. After Laubenstein's death in 1992, aged 45, the New York State Department of Health established an award named after her for HIV/AIDS physicians. She was also memorialized in Larry Kramer's play The Normal Heart and its subsequent film adaptation.  Early life  Linda Laubenstein was born on May 21, 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Priscilla and George Laubenstein. She grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island. Her mother worked as a special-education preschool teacher, while her father worked as a purchasing agent for Providence Gas Company. As a child, she had severe asthma and contracted polio at the age of five. She was placed in an iron lung for three months to prevent respiratory failure and was left paraplegic; she would use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. Because she was unable to physically attend elementary school, an intercom was set up from her classroom to her home. Her high school did not have an elevator, so when she needed to attend classes on the second floor, members of the school's football team would carry her wheelchair up and down the stairs. She chose to attend Barnard College because the campus was accessible for wheelchair users. Aspiring to become a doctor, she took mostly science classes. She went on to study at the New York University School of Medicine, receiving her M.D. in 1973 and completing her internship, residency and fellowship by 1978.  Career  A specialist in hematology and oncology, and clinical professor at the New York University Medical Center, Laubenstein was one of the first in the United States to recognize the appearance of the AIDS epidemic. While working in private practice in New York City, she observed a sudden increase in the number of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma‚Äîa rare cancer that would later be identified as an AIDS-defining illness‚Äîin young gay men with immune deficiencies. With Alvin Friedman-Kien, a dermatologist, she co-authored the first published article on the appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma in gay men. The first patient she diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, in 1979, was a gay man with a generalized rash and enlarged lymph nodes; two weeks later, a colleague asked her to see a second patient, another gay man, with the same disease. Both men turned out to be friends with Ga√´tan Dugas‚Äîoften called the \\"patient zero\\" of HIV/AIDS in North America (though more recent studies suggest otherwise)‚Äîwho the men told Laubenstein had a similar rash. In 1981, when Dugas, a Canadian, heard about Kaposi's sarcoma, he traveled to New York from Montreal to consult with Laubenstein and Friedman-Kien and visited their practice for monthly chemotherapy treatments. By 1982, Laubenstein had treated 62 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. She later left her university position to focus on treating AIDS patients in her private practice. Laubenstein co-founded the Kaposi's Sarcoma Research Fund in 1983. The same year, she and Friedman-Kien arranged the first national-scale medical conference on AIDS at New York University. A collection of research presented at the conference was published in 1984 in a volume titled AIDS: The Epidemic of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections, edited by Laubenstein and Friedman-Kien. In 1986, she and Jeffrey B. Greene founded a non-profit organization, Multitasking. The organization, which provided office services to businesses, employed AIDS patients who had lost their jobs because of the disease and helped them to find new positions. Greene called Laubenstein \\"the ultimate AIDS physician\\" because of the care she provided to her patients, often making house calls in her wheelchair. At a time when many physicians refused to see AIDS patients, Laubenstein's colleague James Wernz, an oncologist, affectionately noted that she was sometimes referred to as \\"bitch on wheels\\" because of her \\"pushy\\" attitude towards other doctors. Laubenstein was also an outspoken AIDS activist and criticized the American government for what she saw as a reluctance to combat the AIDS epidemic. She was also critical of the Catholic Church for its treatment of lesbians and gay men. Some of her opinions caused controversy among other gay activists, such as her call to close gay bathhouses to discourage unsafe sexual behaviors and therefore reduce HIV transmission. Playwright Larry Kramer, who befriended Laubenstein after she cared for his partner, who died from AIDS, said that she was \\"probably the first doctor to suggest that we [gay men] stop having sex altogether\\".  Health problems and death  Laubenstein developed appendicitis in 1984 and was afraid to undergo surgery because of the risk that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems‚Äîwhich were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats‚Äîand was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects. She died unexpectedly at the age of 45 on August 15, 1992, while staying at her family's home in Chatham, Massachusetts. An autopsy was ordered and the cause of her death was determined to be a heart attack. She was survived by her parents and a brother, Peter.  Legacy  Larry Kramer's play The Normal Heart, about the AIDS epidemic of the early 1980s in New York City, features a wheelchair-using medical doctor, Emma Brookner, who is based on Laubenstein. Kramer, an activist as well as a playwright, hoped that his portrayal of Laubentein would \\"enshrine her legacy forever\\". Since the play opened in 1984, the character has been played by Ellen Barkin in a Broadway production and Julia Roberts in a film adaptation. In his book Women and Gay Men in the Postwar Period, John Portmann credits Laubenstein with \\"enrich[ing] the entire gay community through her academic research and social activism\\". Each year, the New York State Department of Health awards the Dr. Linda Laubenstein HIV Clinical Excellence Award to physicians who \\"are distinguished by their compassionate manner and wholehearted involvement in the effort to provide comprehensive care for persons with HIV/AIDS\\".

Biography His father was one of the thirty-six children of Sir Benjamin Bathurst MP, the younger brother of Allen, first Earl Bathurst. One of his uncles was Dr. Henry Bathurst, bishop of Norwich. After being on the books of the guardship at Plymouth for more than a year, he was, on 5 October 1781, appointed to the , which, in the beginning of 1782, accompanied Sir George Rodney to the West Indies, and participated in the Battle of the Saintes off Dominica on 12 April. He afterwards served in the , and was made lieutenant on 15 November 1790. In April 1791 was appointed to the brig on the home station. He continued in her for nearly three years, and on 30 December 1793 was appointed to the frigate , in which he served on the Newfoundland Station, and afterwards with the fleet off Cadiz under Lord St. Vincent. In May 1797 he was transferred to the , and on 3 July 1798 was appointed captain of the same ship by order from Lord St. Vincent. His promotion was not confirmed till 24 October 1799; but he continued to command the Ville de Paris till May 1800, and for a great part of the time with Lord St. Vincent's flag at the main. He afterwards commanded the frigates , , and the Pitt, in the East Indies, in all of which he was fortunate in making several rich prizes. Having brought home the Pitt, rechristened , he still commanded her in the Baltic in 1808, and in July 1809 was employed in escorting part of Lord Chatham's army to Walcheren. The following year he was appointed to the 74-gun ship in which he went out to the Mediterranean, and stayed there till the end of the war. He had no further service till 1824, when he commissioned the 74-gun Genoa which, on 20 October 1827, formed part of the fleet commanded by Sir Edward Codrington at Navarino. The accident of position caused the Genoas loss to be very heavy; her list of killed considerably exceeded that of any other ship in the fleet, and included Bathurst. Codrington wrote a personal letter of condolence to Bathurst's widow, the mother of five children. One of these, following his father's steps, entered the navy, and had attained the rank of commander, when he died at a comparatively early age.

Facing a sentence of 124 years in prison,https://www.theguardian.com/law/shortcuts/2012/mar/07/us-judges-long- prison-sentences Monsegur became an informant for the FBI, working with the agency for over ten months to aid them in identifying the other hackers from LulzSec and related groups. LulzSec intervened in the affairs of organizations such as News Corporation, Stratfor, UK and American law enforcement bodies and Irish political party Fine Gael. Sabu featured prominently in the group's published IRC chats, and claimed to support the \\"Free Topiary\\" campaign. The Economist referred to Sabu as one of LulzSec's six core members and their \\"most expert\\" hacker. Identity Sabu was identified by Backtrace Security as \\"Hector Monsegur\\" on March 11, 2011 in a PDF publication named \\"Namshub\\". On June 25, 2011, an anonymous Pastebin post claimed to identify Sabu as Hector Xavier Monsegur, a man of Puerto Rican origin. At the time of his arrest, Xavier was a 28-year-old unemployed foster parent of his two female cousins, who were the children of Sabu's incarcerated aunt. Sabu attended, but did not graduate from, Washington Irving High School. He had been living in his late grandmother's apartment in the Riis Houses in New York City. Arrest and activity as an informant for the FBI On March 6, 2012, Sabu was revealed to be Hector Xavier Monsegur in a series of articles written by Jana Winter and published by FoxNews.com. Federal agents arrested Monsegur on June 7, 2011. The following day, Monsegur agreed to become an informant for the FBI and to continue his \\"Sabu\\" persona. \\"Since literally the day he was arrested, the defendant has been cooperating with the government proactively,\\" sometimes staying up all night engaging in conversations with co-conspirators to help the government build cases against them, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Pastore said at a secret bail hearing on August 5, 2011. A few days after that bail hearing, Monsegur entered a guilty plea to 12 criminal charges, including multiple counts of conspiracy to engage in computer hacking, computer hacking in furtherance of fraud, conspiracy to commit access device fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. He faced up to 124 years in prison. As an informant, Monsegur provided the FBI with details enabling the arrest of five other hackers associated with the groups Anonymous, LulzSec and Antisec. The FBI provided its own servers for the hacking to take place. Information Monsegur provided also resulted in the arrest of two UK hackers: James Jeffery and Ryan Cleary. The FBI attempted to use Monsegur to entrap Nadim Kobeissi, author of the secure communication software Cryptocat, but without success. Monsegur maintained his pretense until March 6, 2012, even tweeting his \\"opposition\\" to the federal government until the very last. The final day's tweets included, \\"The feds at this moment are scouring our lives without warrants. Without judges approval. This needs to change. Asap\\" and \\"The federal government is run by a bunch of fucking cowards. Don't give in to these people. Fight back. Stay strong\\". On March 6, 2012, the FBI announced the arrests of five male suspects: two from Britain, two from Ireland and one from the U.S. Sabu has not been explicitly linked to the group Anonymous. The extent of crossover between the members of such hacktivist groups, however, is uncertain. Anonymous reacted to Sabu's unmasking and betrayal of LulzSec on Twitter, \\"#Anonymous is a hydra, cut off one head and we grow two back\\". Steve Fishman of New York magazine said \\"On the Internet, Monsegur was now a reviled figure. At Jacob Riis, it was a different story. Those who knew him growing up were shocked‚Äîhe was always 'respectful,' they said. But also, they were a little proud. In their eyes, he was a kid from the projects who'd achieved a certain success. He'd gotten out, finally.\\" A court filing made by prosecutors in late May 2014 revealed Monsegur had prevented 300 cyber attacks in the three years since 2011, including planned attacks on NASA, the U.S. military and media companies. \\"Monsegur's consistent and corroborated historical information, coupled with his substantial proactive cooperation and other evidence developed in the case, contributed directly to the identification, prosecution, and conviction of eight of his major co-conspirators, including Jeremy Hammond, who at the time of his arrest was the FBI's number one cyber- criminal target in the world,\\" a sentencing memo among the documents filed said. Monsegur served 7 months in prison after his arrest but had been free since then while awaiting sentencing. At his sentencing on May 27, 2014, he was given \\"time served\\" for co-operating with the FBI and set free under one year of probation.

In all he expected results which increasing competition made impossible; shareholders and policyholders were promised advantages which they never enjoyed. As a consequence, all Baylis's offices disappeared quite soon, except the English and Scottish Law. He died in 1861, aged 70, in the Cape of Good Hope, where he had settled in his old age. Works Baylis wrote (in 1844) a book on the Arithmetic of Annuities and Life Assurance, adapted more to students.

His father, Colonel Bathurst, brought to England in 1750 Francis Barber, who became famous as Samuel Johnson's black servant. \\"My dear friend, Dr. Bathurst\\", said Dr. Johnson, \\"declared he was glad that his father, who was a West India planter, had left his affairs in total ruin, because, having no estate, he was not under the temptation of having slaves\\". In 1745, he took the degree of M.B. at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and afterwards studied medicine in London, where he made the acquaintance of Dr. Johnson, and was a member of the club at the King's Head. \\"Dear Bathurst\\", Johnson used to say (Piozzi's Anecdotes) \\"was a man to my heart's content; he hated a fool and he hated a rogue, and he hated a whig: he was a very good hater.\\" Bathurst was a contributor to The Adventurer, the newspaper conducted by Hawkesworth, with the assistance of Johnson and Joseph Warton. In September 1754 Bathurst was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital, but went to Barbadoes, whence he wrote two letters to Johnson in 1757 (published by Croker), and became an army physician in the expedition against Havannah, where he died of fever in 1762. \\"The Havannah is taken; a conquest too dearly obtained\\" exclaimed Johnson, \\"for Bathurst died before it. Vix Priamus tanti totaque Troja fuit.\\" Boswell says, on Mrs. Williams's authority, that Dr. Johnson dictated the essays in The Adventurer signed \\"T.\\" to Bathurst, who wrote them down and sold them for two guineas each to his own benefit. Johnson would not acknowledge them, but smiled when he said he did not write them. It is a curious fact that Dr. Johnson often named Bathurst in his prayers after the death of the latter.
