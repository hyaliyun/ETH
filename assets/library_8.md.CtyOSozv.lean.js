She is an English and Drama teacher and lives in Nelson with her husband and three children.  Biography  Rachael Craw was born and raised in Christchurch. She completed a degree in Classical Studies and Drama at the University of Canterbury and then trained as a secondary school teacher and taught English for several years at Christchurch Girls' High School and Rangi Ruru Girls' College. After the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Rachael and her husband and three daughters stayed in their home in a red-zoned street in Christchurch for two years before moving to Nelson. Rachael describes herself as being fascinated with words from an early age and remembers being thrilled to receive her first lockable diary. She has kept journals for many years and was naturally drawn to poetry and scriptwriting. Her interest in and love for the spoken word have developed into a passion for creating good dialogue, an aspect of writing that she enjoys the most. Before beginning the Spark trilogy, she acted, directed and wrote for amateur theatre productions and small independent film ventures. The idea for her first book, Spark, came from a dream. It took five years to write, under the mentorship of Barbara Else and Chris Else (who later became her agents as TFS Literary Agenc]). Rachael then had a one-year deadline to write each of the next two books in the trilogy. Rachael has appeared at a number of literary festivals, including the Perth International Arts Festival 2015, Auckland Writers Festival Schools Programme 2015, WORD Christchurch Writers & Readers Festival 2016, Somerset Celebration of Literature, Queensland 2017, State Library Victoria Reading Matters Conference and Regional Tour of Victoria 2018 and the Storylines Auckland Story Tours 2018. She is active on social media and has the support of the #SparkArm] campaign of teen readers, started by a group of Australian YA book bloggers. Her character Jamie in Spark was nominated for the Teencon Book Boyfriend Battle as part of Sydney's Writers Festival 2015. Her work has been compared to the worldwide hit series The Hunger Games. She cites some of her own favourite authors as Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Knox, Kate Atkinson and Maggie Stiefvater.  Awards and prizes  Craw's first novel Spark was named as a Storylines Notable Book for Young Adult Fiction (2015); it was on the State Library Victoria Inky Awards Silver Inky Award shortlist (2015) and the LIANZA Children's Book Awards Longlist (2015) and was a New Zealand Book Awards Children's Choice Finalist for Young Adult Fiction (2015). It has been recently optioned for film by Miss Conception Films. Stray was the Winner of the Children's Choice Award in the Young Adult Fiction Category for the New Zealand Book Awards for Children & Young Adults (2016).

Surface rupture is opposed by buried rupture, where there is no displacement at ground level. This is a major risk to any structure that is built across a fault zone that may be active, in addition to any risk from ground shaking. Surface rupture entails vertical or horizontal movement, on either side of a ruptured fault. Surface rupture can affect large areas of land. __TOC__ Lack of surface rupture Chelungpu Fault during the 1999 Jiji earthquake, Taiwan Not every earthquake results in surface rupture, particularly for smaller and deeper earthquakes.. In some cases, however, the lack of surface effects is because the fault that moved does not reach the surface. For example, the 1994 Northridge earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.7, caused major damage in the Los Angeles area, occurred at below the Earth's surface, but did not cause surface rupture, because it was a blind thrust earthquake. Where surface rupture occurs Surface ruptures commonly occur on pre-existing faults. Only rarely are earthquakes (and surface ruptures) associated with faulting on entirely new fault structures. There is shallow hypocenter, and large fracture energy on the asperities, the asperity shallower than . Examples of such earthquakes are San Fernando earthquake, Tabas earthquake, and Chi-Chi earthquake. In surface rupture earthquakes, the large slips of land are concentrated in the shallow parts of the fault. And, notably, permanent ground displacements which are measureable can be produced by shallow earthquakes, of magnitude M5 and greater. Types of surface rupture The form that surface rupturing takes depends on two things: the nature of the material at the surface and the type of fault movement. Consequences of the Chi-Chi earthquake, Jiji, Nantou County, Taiwan Effect of surface lithology Where there are thick superficial deposits overlying the trace of the faults, the resulting surface effects are typically more discontinuous. Where there is little or no superficial deposits, the surface rupture is generally continuous, except where the earthquake rupture affects more than one fault, which can lead to complex patterns of surface faulting, such as in the 1992 Landers earthquake. Normal faulting Surface ruptures associated with normal faults are typically simple fault scarps. Where there are significant superficial deposits, sections with more oblique faulting may form sets of en- echelon scarp segments. Antithetic faults may also develop, giving rise to surface grabens. Reverse faulting Reverse faulting (particularly thrust faulting) is associated with more complex surface rupture patterns since the protruding unsupported part of the hanging-wall of the fault is liable to collapse. In addition there may be surface folding and back-thrust development. Strike-slip faulting Extent of surface rupture caused by strike-slip faulting during the 2002 Denali earthquake Strike-slip faults are associated with dominantly horizontal movement, leading to relatively simple linear zones of surface rupture where the fault is a simple planar structure. However, many strike-slip faults are formed of overlapping segments, leading to complex zones of normal or reverse faulting depending on the nature of the overlap. Additionally, where there are thick superficial deposits, the rupture typically appears as a set of en-echelon faults. Mitigation To retrofit a house to survive surface rupture requires engineered design by geotechnical, and structural or civil engineers. This can be quite expensive.

Two accounts of Ortiz's eleven years as a captive, differing in details, offer a story of Ortiz being sentenced to death by a Native American chief two or three times, saved each time by the intervention of a daughter (and possibly other female relatives) of the chief, and finally escaping to a neighboring chiefdom, whose chief sheltered him.  Captivity  Juan Ortiz being sacrificed by burning, with the daughter of Chief Uzita pleading for his life In 1528 Juan Ortiz was on a ship searching Tampa Bay for any sign of the Narv√°ez expedition which had landed in Tampa Bay the year before. Ortiz and one or more companions were enticed on shore by some people who had what the Spanish thought was a message from Narv√°ez. (The Spanish would not learn the fate of the Narv√°ez expedition for another eight years, until √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca and three other survivors reached a Spanish outpost in northwestern New Spain.) Ortiz and his companions were captured by the people on shore and abandoned by their shipmates. All but Ortiz were either killed while resisting capture or shortly after being taken to the town of Uzita. After Ortiz was taken to the town of Uzita (as told by the Gentleman of Elvas), or some time after Ortiz was spared from execution by being shot with arrows (per the Inca), the chief ordered Ortiz tied to a rack set over a fire. The chief's daughter begged the chief to spare Ortiz, arguing that Ortiz was not a danger to the chief. Chief Uzita's daughter helping Juan Ortiz to escape After Ortiz's burns had been tended to, he was set to guard bodies placed in the charnel house of the town, to keep predators from taking the bodies away during the night. One night a wolf took the body of a young child that had recently died. Ortiz pursued the wolf in the night and killed it, recovering the child's body. The chief Uzita treated Ortiz better for a while after that. Two or three years after Ortiz had been captured, the chiefdom of Mocoso attacked Uzita, burning the town. The town of Uzita was then moved to a new location, and the chiefdom's gods demanded that Ortiz be sacrificed. The daughter of Chief Uzita warned Ortiz that he was to be sacrificed and told him he should go to Mocoso, whose chief had asked for Ortiz to be given to him. The daughter led Ortiz out of the town at night, and showed him the path to Mocoso.  Rescue and after  The discovery of Juan Ortiz by the de Soto Expedition Juan Ortiz was found by the de Soto Expedition when they landed in Tampa Bay in 1539. After first landing at Uzita, de Soto and his men heard of a Christian living in a neighboring chiefdom. While searching for Ortiz, de Soto's men encountered ten or so Native Americans, and started to attack them. One of the natives, however, managed to make them understand that he was a Christian (one account says he did so by calling out \\"Sevilla\\", which was his home town). Ortiz then led the Spanish to the town of Mocoso, whose chief, also named Mocoso, had sheltered him for many years. Mocoso was friendly to de Soto, which created tension between Mocoso and other chiefdoms around Tampa Bay, including Orriygua, Neguarete, Capaloey and Uzita. Ortiz could speak the languages of both Uzita and Mocoso (which were mutually unintelligible). The language of Mocoso was apparently a dialect of the Timucua language, which made Ortiz very useful to de Soto. As the expedition traveled up the Florida peninsula, it passed through chiefdoms that spoke various dialects of the Timucua language, until the expedition crossed the Aucilla River, and entered the Apalachee Province. From that point the expedition relied on Timucua speakers who could translate from other languages, with Ortiz then providing a translation into Spanish. Juan Ortiz died sometime during the winter of 1541‚Äì1542, while the expedition was camped at the town of Autiamque in what is now Arkansas.  Legend  The Inca's version of the story of Juan Ortiz and the daughter of Chief Hirrihigua has grown into a legend. The daughter of a chief has become \\"Princess Hirrihigua\\", and in some versions has acquired a name, \\"Uleleh\\". The Princess Hirrihigua Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a marker in St. Petersburg, Florida, commemorating the story of Juan Ortiz and Princess Hirrihigua in 1960. A longer version of this legend, with the addition of the name \\"Uleleh\\", \\"The Story of Juan Ortiz and Uleleh\\", was published by a historical society in 1908.  John Smith and Pocahontas  Some scholars have speculated that John Smith's story of being saved from death at the hands of Powhatan by his daughter Pocahontas was inspired by the story of Juan Ortiz being saved by the daughter of Chief Uzita. Richard Hakluyt's translation into English of A Narrative of the Expedition of Ferdinand de Soto into Florida by the Gentleman of Elvas was published in London in 1609, several years before John Smith published his account of being saved by Pocahontas.

It is published weekly on Thursday, with an estimated circulation of 7,400. It is edited by Matt Brown. History The Courier traces its history to 1876, with its establishment by W. M. Shattuck, and after a series of sales was purchased in 1900 by the Olmstead family. The Argus dates back to 1859, founded by J. J. Pennypacker. The two papers co-existed for some time, with their respective leadership playing prominent roles in the newly formed North of Bay Counties Press Association. In 1928, the Olmsteds bought the Argus, and the Argus- Courier was first issued in July 1928 after the merger of the two papers. In 1995, the Olmsted family sold the paper to Scripps League Newspapers. In 1993, the paper, which had been daily since 1928, cut down to a two day a week schedule, citing financial pressures. The move left Santa Rosa's Press Democrat as the county's only daily. Pulitzer Publishing Company bought Scripps League for about $230 million in 1996. The New York Times Company bought the Argus-Courier in 2001. The New York Times Company sold its regional papers to Halifax Media in 2012; Halifax sold the Argus-Courier to Sonoma Media Investments later that year.  National coverage and awards  Argus- Courier reporting has been featured in national news reporting, as with the story of Petaluma resident Polly Klaas's murder, where the paper served as a source of reporting, and its staff served as commentators on the culture of the town.

Overdose Koivunen was a Finnish soldier, assigned to a ski patrol on 20 April 1944, along with several other Finnish soldiers. Three days into their mission, on March 18th, the group was attacked and surrounded by Soviet forces, from which they managed to escape. Koivunen became fatigued after skiing for a long distance, but could not stop. He was also the sole carrier of army-issue Pervitin, or methamphetamine, a stimulant used to remain awake while on duty. Koivunen had trouble pulling out a single pill, so he emptied the entire bottle of thirty capsules into his hand and took them all. He had a short burst of energy, but then entered into a state of delirium, and lost consciousness. Koivunen remembered waking up the following morning, separated from his patrol and having no supplies. In the following days, he escaped Soviet forces once again, was injured by a land mine, and laid in a ditch for a week waiting for help. After skiing more than 400 km (250 miles) he was found and admitted to a nearby hospital, where his heart rate was measured at 200 beats per minute, double the average human heartbeat, and weighing only 43 kg (94 pounds). In the week Koivunen was gone, he subsisted only on pine buds and a single Siberian jay that he caught and ate raw. He ended up surviving and died peacefully at the age of 71.

Helmore (born 1940) is a New Zealand artist and illustrator, known both for his fine art and for his scientific work depicting insects, not least illustrating the New Zealand Arthropod Collection. One of the country's most noted and prolific biological illustrators, over 1000 of his illustrations of insects were published in research papers from 1976 to 2006.  Life and education  A 1979 Des Helmore drawing of the weevil Helmoreus sharpi; the genus was named after him. Helmore was born in Takapau, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, and lived there on a farm until age 12. Interested in drawing since childhood, he attended Christ's College in Christchurch, and then the Ilam School of Fine Arts at the University of Canterbury from 1959 to 1962, where he was taught by Rudi Gopas, Russell Clark, and Bill Sutton. His fellow students at Ilam included Dick Frizzell, Tony Fomison, and John Panting. In his survey of New Zealand art, Frizzell described Helmore as someone who \\"seemed to have already graduated from somewhere else. All that quiet abstract pondering. I [Frizzell] couldn't believe he knew what he was doing, because I certainly didn't.\\" At this time Helmore, through beatnik culture, became interested in Zen Buddhism and Taoism. He won a life-painting prize, and graduated in 1963 with a Diploma of Fine Arts (Hons). After working in London from 1967 to 1969, Helmore returned to New Zealand and lived in Auckland for over 40 years. He moved to Hastings in 2018.  Illustration  From 1967 to 1969 Helmore worked as a geographical illustrator at University College London where he learnt the technical aspects of creating maps and illustrations for publication. Upon returning to New Zealand in 1970 he was employed as an entomological illustrator at Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, working alongside the painter Tony Fomison. From 1971 to 1975 he worked as a graphic artist and graphic designer for NZBC Television and TV1 News in Christchurch, creating lettering, illustrations, and title sequences, but was unhappy with the daily deadlines. In June 1975 Helmore moved to Auckland and worked as an entomological illustrator for the Systematics Section of Entomology Division, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, until 1992, then for Invertebrate Systematics at Landcare Research from 1992 to 2006. Over these years he created over 1000 insect illustrations for scientific publications, particularly the Fauna of New Zealand series. The illustrations were created using a stereomicroscope with a camera lucida, and were drawn two to three times larger than final print size on illustration board with technical pens (or sometimes on scraperboard). Each took three or four days to complete. His drawings have been described as \\"magnificent\\" and \\"exquisitely executed\\" by entomologists. The scientist Sir Charles Fleming wrote, \\"Des Helmore's drawings supply the need for pictures of entire insects felt by many New Zealand amateurs and interdisciplinary students, to an artistic standard few can hope to emulate.\\" The entomologist Anthony Harris said, \\"Desmond Helmore's superb illustrations rank with the very best in the field ‚Äì such as those of Arthur Smith, A. J. E. Terzi, and T. Nagatani.\\" Helmoreus, a genus of weevils, is named in his honour, \\"in recognition of his contribution to New Zealand entomology as a scientific illustrator\\".  Art  Helmore and his art, taken in 2018 in his Hastings home Since leaving art school Helmore has continued painting. His work has been described by Dick Frizzell as having a \\"strangely dense atmosphere\\" and critic T.J. McNamara has referred to its \\"lonely vertical shapes\\" and \\"dim and strange\\" light. After being influenced by constructivism and cubism in the 1960s, he began painting depictions of rural landscapes after about 1985. Since 2000 his work has focussed on depictions of urban environments. His first solo show was in 1964 at the Hawke‚Äôs Bay Art Gallery, Napier. In 1965 he received a Merit Award for the Manawatu Contemporary Art Competition, which was followed in 1966 by a solo exhibition at the Manawatu Art Gallery (now Te Manawa) in Palmerston North. While living in London he had a solo show at the B. H. Corner Gallery in 1968, and in 1972 he was a finalist in the Benson & Hedges Art Awards. Helmore has exhibited since 1990 in solo and group shows at the Auckland galleries Lopdell House, Claybrook, Anna Bibby, Jane Sanders Art, and nkb Gallery. He has also exhibited at Ramp Gallery in Hamilton, the Hastings City Art Gallery, and, in 2017, at Spa_ce Gallery, Napier. Reviewing his 2011 solo exhibition at Jane Sanders Art, for The New Zealand Herald, T.J. McNamara said: His work is in a number of collections, including those of Christchurch Art Gallery, the University of Canterbury, the Hocken Library, the Canterbury Society of Arts, and Hawke's Bay Art Gallery.

Construction began in April, 1891, and the building was completed in 1892. With The Boise City National Bank building also has been named the Simplot Building, the Baird Building, and the Capital Security Building. Additionally the building is known informally either as the 801 Building or as the 805 Building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places November 28, 1978. Architecture The Boise City National Bank building was constructed on a corner lot measuring 70 feet on West Idaho Street and 60 feet on North 8th Street, and within the building the bank occupied commercial space 25 feet by 53 feet. Other storefront space opened onto 8th Street and Idaho Street. The second and third floors each contained eleven offices brightened by a central skylight. The building features a sandstone facade, originally intended to extend only six feet above street level. Brick with stone trim would have completed the facade above the sandstone. But the design was modified a month after construction began, completing the entire facade in sandstone. Delivery of one block of stone from quarries at Table Rock weighing 14,000 pounds required a team of eight horses.After the stone was cut it only weighed between 5000 and 6000 pounds, but it required eight workers and two derricks to place it above the bank entrance. In 1904 Tourtellotte & Co. began constructing a 4th floor of the building, and the architects supervised an interior renovation and installed an elevator. Frontage on Idaho Street expanded to 150 feet, including 25 feet frontage for the Boise Butcher Co. Depth of the building expanded to 122 feet. The sandstone facade was extended to cover the new construction. When completed, the new top floor was designed further by architects Wayland & Fennell to accommodate the Boise Commercial Club. In 1912 Tourtellotte & Hummel redesigned the 8th Street exposure, moving the bank entrance from the corner of 8th and Idaho Streets to a new location on 8th Street and expanding the bank into space previously rented by Ballou & Latimer Drug Store. History of Boise City National Bank Boise City National Bank opened April 1, 1886, in a building at 7th and Main Streets in Boise City. In May of that year it received a shipment of engraved bank notes, and in July the bank began paying interest on term deposits. In November the bank became a federal depository. By the end of 1886 the bank had nearly $64,000 in demand deposits and over $20,000 in term deposits. As its business grew, the bank needed a larger building. Plans for the new building were drawn 18 months prior to construction in 1891, and the delay may have reflected concern at the bank that Idaho would not remain a state but revert to its pre-1890 status as a territory. And the original design was provided not by James King but by an architect in Chicago, the location of Marshall Field's Wholesale Store designed by Henry Hobson Richardson. King became the architect amid concern that Boise City did not have resources to construct the Chicago design. After construction, Boise City National Bank occupied the building from March 26, 1892, until August 1, 1932. On that day the bank failed to open, and its assets and liabilities were placed with the Comptroller of the Currency. Other tenants of the building in 1892 included the United States district court, the United States Marshals Service, and the United States Surveyor General's office.

Lured to the consulate building on the pretext of providing him papers for his upcoming wedding, Khashoggi was ambushed, suffocated, and dismemberedDavid D. Kirkpatrick & Nick Cumming-Bruce, Saudis Called Khashoggi 'Sacrificial Animal' as They Waited to Kill Him, New York Times (19 June 2019). by a 15-member squad of Saudi assassins. Khashoggi's final moments are captured in audio recordings, transcripts of which were subsequently made public.Nicholas Sakelaris, Saudi Prince bin Salman accepts responsibility but not blame for Khashoggi death, United Press International (26 September 2019).Audio transcripts of Jamal Khashoggi's murder revealed, Al Jazeera (10 September 2019). The Turkish investigation concluded that Khashoggi had been strangled as soon as he entered the consulate building, and that his body was dismembered and disposed of. Turkish investigators, as well as investigations by the New York Times, concluded that some of the 15 members of the Saudi hit team were closely connected to Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and that the team had traveled to Istanbul specifically to commit the murder.Ben Hubbard, Saudi Arabia Seeks Death Penalty for 5 Suspects in Khashoggi Killing, New York Times (3 January 2019). The Saudi government engaged in an extensive effort to cover-up the killing, including destroying evidence. After repeatedly shifting its account of what happened to Khashoggi in the days following the killing, the Saudi government admitted that Khashoggi had been killed in a premeditated murder, but denied that the killing took place on the orders of bin Salman, who said he accepted responsibility for the killing \\"because it happened under my watch\\" but asserted that he did not order it. Turkish officials released an audio recording of Khashoggi's killing that they alleged contained evidence that Khashoggi had been assassinated on the orders of Mohammed bin Salman. By November 2018, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, based on multiple sources of intelligence, had concluded that bin Salman had ordered Khashoggi's assassination. In the same month, the United States sanctioned 17 Saudi individuals under the Magnitsky Act over the Khashoggi murder, including former bin Salman advisor Saud Al-Qahtani, but did not sanction bin Salman himself.Kim Hjelmgaard, US sanctions 17 Saudi nationals over Jamal Khashoggi's killing, USA Today (15 November 2018). U.S. President Donald Trump disputed the CIA assessment, expressed support for bin Salman, and stated that the investigation into Khashoggi's death had to continue. The murder prompted intense global scrutiny and criticism of the Saudi government.Marwa Rashad & Mark Hosenball, Saudi Arabia sentences five to death over Khashoggi murder, U.N. official decries 'mockery', Reuters (23 December 2019). A June 2019 report issued by Agn√®s Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, concluded that Khashoggi's murder was \\"a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated.\\" Callamard determined that responsibility for Khashoggi's killing, and the elaborate campaign to cover it up, rests with the highest officials of the Saudi royal court and that \\"credible evidence\\" called for the \\"investigation of high-level Saudi officials' individual liability, including the crown prince's.\\" Callamard's report also detailed the role of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul in coordinating the killing, undercutting the claim that the murder was an unauthorized act by rogue operatives. The special rapporteur called for a criminal investigation to be undertaken by the UN and, because Khashoggi was a resident of the United States, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. In January 2019, the Saudi government began trials against 11 Saudis accused of involvement in Khashoggi's murder.Donna Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia Begins Trial in Khashoggi Murder, Wall Street Journal (January 3, 2019). In December 2019, following proceedings shrouded in secrecy, a Saudi court acquitted three defendants; sentenced five defendants to death; and sentenced three defendants to prison terms. The acquitted defendants, Saud al-Qahtani and Ahmed al-Asiri, were high-level Saudi security officials, while the five men sentenced to death were \\"essentially foot soldiers in the killing\\" and were eventually legally pardoned in May 2020 by Khashoggi's children. Saudi prosecutors rejected the findings of the UN investigation and asserted that the killing \\"was not premeditated\\" but the decision to commit it was instead \\"taken at the spur of the moment.\\" UN special rapporteur Callamard said the Saudi verdict was a \\"mockery\\" because \\"the masterminds not only walk free, they have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial.\\" Human rights group Amnesty International called the verdict a \\"whitewash\\" and the Turkish government said that the trials had fallen far short of \\"justice being served and accountability.\\" Victim 4 June 2009 ‚àí after his speech right Khashoggi was a Saudi journalist, author, and a former general manager and editor-in-chief of Al-Arab News Channel. He also served as editor for the Saudi newspaper Al Watan, turning it into a platform for Saudi progressives. Khashoggi fled Saudi Arabia in June 2017 and went into self-imposed exile in the US. He became a frequent contributor to publications like the Washington Posts global opinions section and continued to criticize the Saudi government from afar. He had been sharply critical of Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, and the country's king, Salman of Saudi Arabia. He also opposed the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. He said, \\"The government banned me from Twitter when I cautioned against an overly enthusiastic embrace of then-President-elect Donald Trump.\\" In September 2017, the Washington Post published its first column by Khashoggi, in which he criticized the prince and the kingdom's direction and advocated for reform in his country. Once Khashoggi's collaboration with the Washington Post started, he was harassed via Twitter from pro-regime bot accounts commonly known as \\"the electronic flies\\". Saud al-Qahtani, the \\"lord of the flies\\", was an official tasked by Crown Prince Mohammed with implementing a zero-tolerance crackdown on dissent on social media; Qahtani was later implicated in Khashoggi's murder. Just before his assassination, Khashoggi launched several projects to combat online abuse in an attempt to consolidate the opposition and accuse Crown Prince Mohammed of mismanaging the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Khashoggi collaborated with Omar Abdelaziz, one of the most visible public critics of the Saudi regime abroad who had received asylum in Canada, on a range of projects. One project was named Geish al-Nahl ÿ¨Ÿäÿ¥ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ≠ŸÑ (Army of the Bees or The Bees Army). They wanted to create a counterpoint to the regime's propaganda machine \\"a network of pro-democracy activists who would post and amplify one another's messages about Saudi political issues\\". Abdulaziz said they wanted \\"to talk about the dissidents, the political prisoners, freedom of speech, human rights\\" and \\"make people aware of what's really happening\\". And the Bee Movement should also provide cybersecurity to \\"people living in Saudi Arabia and other oppressive regimes in the Middle East\\" in need of a safe way to express themselves. As Khashoggi wrote in his last, posthumously published, column, he was of the opinion that \\"What the Arab world needs most is free expression\\". Khashoggi and Abdelaziz were also working on a short film, showing how the Saudi leadership was dividing the country, a website tracking human rights and the new foundation \\"Democracy for the Arab World Now\\" (DAWN) Khashoggi was forming. They tried to keep their work secret from Saudi persecution. In late September 2018, Khashoggi met with friends in London to discuss his various plans. In summer 2018, Abdulaziz's cellphone was infected with a surveillance tool. This was first revealed on 1 October 2018 in a detailed forensic report by Citizen Lab, a University of Toronto project that investigates digital espionage against civil society. Citizen Lab concluded with a \\"high degree of confidence\\" that his cellphone was successfully targeted with NSO Group's Pegasus spyware and attributed this infection to an operator linked to \\"Saudi Arabia's government and security services\\". NSO's Pegasus, of which KSA has emerged as one of its biggest operators, is one of the most advanced spyware tools available. It is designed to infect cell phones without being detected. Among other known cases, KSA is believed to have used NSO software to target London-based Saudi dissident Yahya Assiri, a former Royal Saudi Air Force officer and founder the human rights organisation ALQST and an Amnesty International researcher. Through their sophisticated spyware attack on Abdulaziz's phone, the Saudi regime would have had a direct line into Khashoggi's private thoughts, and access to hours of conversations between the two men. Abdulaziz recalled: \\"Jamal was very polite in public, but in private, he spoke more freely he was very very critical of the crown prince.\\" On 21 September, just eleven days before Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate, he made a declaration of support for the Bees Movement. Using the Bee Army's first hashtag \\"what do you know about bees\\" he tweeted \\"They love their home country and defend it with truth and rights\\". On 9 October, one week after his disappearance, The Washington Post published an article in which Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fianc√©, claimed that he had applied for U.S. citizenship. On 19 October, The Wilson Center issued a statement saying that they had offered him a fellowship at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (or Wilson Center), located in Washington, D.C. On 22 October, Marc Owen Jones, an assistant professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Doha who researched Arab propaganda and has monitored Saudi Twitter bots for two years, said he has seen a massive surge in pro-regime Twitter activity, and in the creation of troll accounts, since Khashoggi went missing: \\"There was such a huge spike in October in bot accounts and the use of the hashtags praising the crown prince, it's absurd\\". After Khashoggi's assassination, the Saudi cyber-operations were the focus of global scrutiny. The Government of Canada started an investigation in to those malicious cyberattacks. In December 2018 Omar Abdulaziz granted CNN access to his text messages with Jamal Khashoggi, where the two discussed their sharp criticism and political opposition to Mohammed bin Salman. Abdulaziz filed a lawsuit against an Israeli company NSO Group Technologies that allowed his smartphone to be taken over and his communications to be spied on by the Saudi regime. US intelligence reports The Washington Post reported on 10 October 2018 that U.S. intelligence intercepted communications of Saudi officials discussing a plan ordered by the Crown Prince Bin Salman, to capture Khashoggi from his home in Virginia. The intercepted communications were regarded as significant because Khashoggi had bought a home in McLean, Virginia, where he lived after fleeing the KSA. Khashoggi had obtained an O visa also known as the \\"genius\\" visa, that offers individuals of \\"extraordinary ability and achievement\\" in the sciences, arts, education, and other fields and are recognized internationally he had applied for permanent residency status, and three of his children were US citizens. As a legal resident of the United States Khashoggi was entitled to protection. Under a directive adopted in 2015, the US intelligence community has a \\"duty to warn\\" people including those who are not US citizens who are at risk of being kidnapped or killed. This directive was a central aspect of the conversation about the US's response to Khashoggi's disappearance. According to the National Security Agency (NSA) officials, the White House was warned of this threat through official intelligence channels. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) of Dan Coats declined to comment on why Khashoggi was not warned. 55 members of Congress demanded in a letter clarity from DNI Dan Coats on what the intelligence community knew about the risk Khashoggi faced before his disappearance and whether American officials attempted to notify him that his life was in danger. In the letter, they sought insight into everything the NSA knows about phone calls and emails from Saudi officials on the Khashoggi case. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed a lawsuit against five US intelligence services \\"seeking immediate release of records concerning U.S. intelligence agencies' compliance or non-compliance with their 'duty to warn' reporter Jamal Khashoggi of threats to his life or liberty\\". The Committee to Protect Journalists joined the legal effort. On 16 November, Central Intelligence Agency members who internally analyzed multiple sources of intelligence concluded that Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's assassination. On 20 November, US President Donald Trump disputed the CIA assessment and stated that the investigation into Khashoggi's death had to continue. Disappearance Saudi Arabian activist right right Over the year 2017, the House of Saud appealed to Khashoggi to return to Riyadh and resume his services as a media advisor to the royal court. But he declined in fear that it was a ruse and that upon returning he would be imprisoned or worse. Khashoggi met with crown prince Mohammed's brother Prince Khalid at the Saudi embassy in Washington, in \\"early 2018 or late 2017.\\" In September 2018 Khashoggi visited the Washington embassy again, to retrieve paperwork for his pending marriage to his Turkish fianc√©e, Hatice Cengiz. He tried to complete everything in the U.S. but was instead lured to the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey, where his fianc√©e lived. Khashoggi's first visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was on 28 September 2018 where he showed up unannounced. Having divorced his wife, who had remained in Saudi Arabia, he went to the consulate to obtain a document certifying that he was no longer married so he could marry his Turkish fianc√©e. Before that visit he \\"sought assurances about his safety from friends in the US\\" and instructed his fianc√©e to contact Turkish authorities if he failed to emerge. He received a warm welcome from officials, and was told to return to the consulate on 2 October. \\"He was very pleased with their nice treatment and hospitality\\", she later said. On 29 September Khashoggi traveled to London and spoke at a conference. On 1 October Khashoggi returned to Istanbul, and he told a friend that he was worried about being kidnapped and sent back to KSA. Meanwhile, at around 16:30, a three- person Saudi team arrived in Istanbul on a scheduled flight, checked in to their hotels then visited the consulate, according to President Erdogan. Another group of officials from the consulate traveled to a forest in Istanbul's outskirts and the nearby city of Yalova on a \\"reconnaissance\\" trip. Erdogan said a \\"road map\\" to kill Khashoggi was devised in Saudi Arabia during this time. In the night of 2 October, a 15-member group arrived from Riyadh on two private Gulfstream jets. On 2 October 2018 CCTV showed the suspected agents entering the consulate around noon. Khashoggi arrived about an hour later, accompanied by his fianc√©e Cengiz, whom he entrusted with two cell phones while she waited outside for him. He entered the consulate, through main entrance, at around 1 pm. As he had not come out by 4 pm, even though the working hours of the consulate were until 3:30 pm, Cengiz contacted the authorities, phoning Khashoggi's friend, Yasin Aktay, an adviser to President Erdogan, reported him missing and the police then started an investigation. The Saudi government said that he had left the consulate via a back entrance. The Turkish government first said that he was still inside, and his fianc√©e and friends said that he was missing. Turkish authorities have claimed that security camera footage of the day of the incident was removed from the consulate and that Turkish consulate staff were abruptly told to take a holiday on the day Khashoggi disappeared while inside the building. Turkish police investigators told the media that the recordings from the security cameras did not show any evidence of Khashoggi leaving the consulate. A security camera was located outside the consulate's front which showed him entering but not leaving, while another camera installed at a preschool opposite the rear entrance of the consulate also did not show him leaving. The disappearance presented Turkish officials with a sharp diplomatic challenge. Jamal Elshayyal reported Turkish authorities were trying to walk a fine line so as not to damage the Turkish-Saudi relationship: \\"There is an attempt by the Turkish government to try to find a way out of this whereby there isn't a full collapse of diplomatic relations, at least a temporary freeze between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Because, if indeed, Turkish authorities can prove unequivocally that Saudi agents essentially murdered a journalist inside the consulate in Istanbul, it would require some sort of strong reaction.\\" Analysts have suggested that Khashoggi may have been considered especially dangerous by the Saudi leadership not because he was a long-time dissident, but rather, a pillar of the Saudi establishment who had been close to its ruling circles for decades, had worked as an editor at Saudi news outlets and had been an adviser to a former Saudi intelligence chief Turki bin Faisal Al Saud. Assassination According to numerous anonymous police sources, the Turkish police believe that Khashoggi was tortured and killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member team brought in from Saudi Arabia for the operation. One anonymous police source claimed that the dead body was \\"cut into pieces\\" and quietly moved out of the consulate, and that all of this was \\"videotaped to prove the mission had been accomplished and the tape was taken out of the country\\". Middle East Eye cited an anonymous Saudi who said the Tiger Squad brought Khashoggi's fingers to Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh as other evidence that the mission was successful. On 7 October, Turkish officials pledged to release evidence showing that Khashoggi was killed. Aktay initially said he believed Khashoggi had been killed in the consulate, but on 10 October he claimed that \\"the Saudi state is not blamed here\\", something that a journalist for The Guardian saw as Turkey trying not to harm lucrative trade ties and a delicate regional relationship with Saudi Arabia. Turkey then claimed to have audio and video evidence of the killing occurring inside the consulate. U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States had asked Turkey for the recordings. According to \\"people familiar with the matter\\", the audio was shared with Central Intelligence Agency agents; a CIA spokeswoman declined to comment. CNN reported on 15 October that Saudi Arabia was about to admit to the killing, but would claim that it was an \\"interrogation gone bad\\", as opposed to a targeted death squad killing. This claim drew criticism from some, considering that Khashoggi was reportedly dismembered and that his killing was allegedly premeditated, and the circumstances, including the arrival and departure of a team of 15, included forensic specialists presumed to have been present to hide evidence of the crime, on the same day. The next day, Middle East Eye reported that, according to an anonymous Turkish source, the killing took about seven minutes and forensic specialist Salah Muhammed al-Tubaigy, who had brought along a bone saw, cut Khashoggi's body into pieces while Khashoggi was still alive, as he and his colleagues listened to music. The source further claimed that \\"Khashoggi was dragged from consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi's office at the Saudi consulate ... Tubaigy began to cut Khashoggi's body up on a table in the study while he was still alive,\\" and \\"There was no attempt to interrogate him. They had come to kill him.\\" The Turkish pro-government newspaper Daily Sabah reported on 18 October that neighbours to the consul's residence had observed an unusual barbecue party, which the paper suggested might have been to mask the smell from the incineration of the dismembered corpse: \\"We have been living here for twelve years but I have never seen them having a barbecue party. That day, they had a barbecue party in the garden.\\" The Wall Street Journal published reports from anonymous sources that Khashoggi was tortured in front of top Saudi diplomat Mohammad al-Otaibi, Saudi Arabia's consul general. Reuters reported that al- Otaibi left Istanbul for Riyadh on 16 October. His departure came hours before his home was expected to be searched in relation to the journalist's disappearance. On 20 October, the Saudi Foreign Ministry reported that a preliminary investigation showed that Khashoggi had died at the consulate while engaged in a fight, the first Saudi acknowledgement of Khashoggi's death. On 20 October Saud al-Qahtani and Ahmad Asiri were announced fired by Saudi Arabia for involvement in Khashoggi's killing according to the BBC. On 21 October, an anonymous Saudi official said Khashoggi had been threatened with drugging and kidnapping by Maher Mutreb, had resisted and was restrained with a chokehold, which killed him. On 22 October, Reuters cited a Turkish intelligence source and a high-ranking Arab with access to intelligence and links to members of Saudi's royal court and reported that Saud al-Qahtani, the then-top aide for Mohammed bin Salman, had made a Skype call to the consulate while Khashoggi was held in the room. Qahtani reportedly insulted Khashoggi, who responded in kind. According to the Turkish source, Qahtani then asked the team to kill Khashoggi. Qahtani instructed: \\"Bring me the head of the dog\\". According to both sources, the audio of the Skype call is currently with Erdogan. According to Nazif Karaman of the Daily Sabah, the audio recording from inside the consulate revealed that Khashoggi's last words were: \\"I'm suffocating... take this bag off my head, I'm claustrophobic.\\" On 10 December, the details of the transcript of the audio were described to CNN by an anonymous source. On 16 November, a H√ºrriyet columnist reported that Turkey has more evidence, including a second audio recording from the consulate, where the Saudi team reviews the plans on how to execute Khashoggi. He also reported that: \\"Turkish officials also did not confirm [Saudi prosecutor's claim] that Khashoggi was killed after they gave him a fatal dose of drug. They say that he was strangulated with a rope or something like a plastic bag.\\" Investigation right U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with King Salman on 16 October 2018. Hatice Cengiz begged the US government to take action in helping to find her fianc√©. In her Washington Post op-ed on 9 October, Cengiz wrote, \\"At this time, I implore President Trump and first lady Melania Trump to help shed light on Jamal's disappearance. I also urge Saudi Arabia, especially King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to show the same level of sensitivity and release CCTV footage from the consulate.\\" Sabah reported on 11 October that Turkish officials were investigating whether Khashoggi's Apple Watch would reveal clues as to what happened to him inside the Saudi consulate, examining whether data from the smartwatch could have been transmitted to the cloud, or his personal phone, which was with Cengiz. On the evening of 14 October, President Erdoƒüan and King Salman announced that a deal had been made for a \\"jointing working group\\" to examine the case. On 15 October the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced that an \\"inspection\\" of the consulate, by both Turkish and Saudi officials, would take place that afternoon. According to an anonymous source from the Attorney General's office, Turkish officials found evidence of \\"tampering\\" during the inspection, and evidence that supports the belief Khashoggi was killed. President Erdoƒüan said that \\"investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over\\". According to anonymous sources, Turkish police have expanded the search, as Khashoggi's body may have been disposed of in nearby Belgrad Forest or on farmland in Yalova Province, as indicated by the movement of the Saudi vehicles, and DNA tests of samples from the Saudi consulate and the consul's residence are being conducted; Al Jazeera reported that according to anonymous sources, fingerprints of one of the alleged perpetrators, Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, were found in the consulate. Confirmation of death On 20 October, the Saudi Foreign Ministry reported that a preliminary investigation showed that Khashoggi had died at the consulate while engaged in a fight, the first Saudi acknowledgement of Khashoggi's death. On 22 October, six US and Western officials stated they believed that the crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, because of his role overseeing the Saudi security apparatus, was ultimately responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance, and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Gina Haspel, departed for Turkey to work on the investigation \\"amid a growing international uproar over Saudi's explanation of the killing\\". The Governor of ƒ∞stanbul's office said that Khashoggi's fianc√©e, Hatice Cengiz, had been given 24-hour police protection. Also on 22 October, CNN aired CCTV law enforcement footage from the Turkish authorities, showing the Saudi agent Mustafa al-Madani, a member of the 15-man team, leaving the consulate by the back door. He was dressed up in Khashoggi's clothes, except for the shoes. Madani had also put on a fake beard that resembled Khashoggi's facial hair, his glasses and his Apple Watch. Madani, who was of similar age, height, and build to Khashoggi, left the consulate from its back door. He was later seen at Istanbul's Blue Mosque, where he went to a public bathroom and changed back to his own clothes and discarded Khashoggi's clothes. Later he was seen dining with another Saudi agent, and the footage shows him smiling and laughing. An anonymous Turkish official believes that Madani was brought to Istanbul to act as a body double and that \\"You don't need a body double for a rendition or an interrogation. Our assessment has not changed since October 6. This was a premeditated murder, and the body was moved out of the consulate.\\" The use of the body double might have been an attempt to lend credence to the Saudi government's first version of events: that Khashoggi walked out through the back not long after he arrived. But \\"it was a flawed body double, so it never became an official part of the Saudi government's narrative\\", a Turkish diplomat told The Washington Post. The body double footage bolstered Turkish claims that the Saudis always intended either to kill Khashoggi or move him back to Saudi Arabia. √ñmer √áelik, a spokesman for Turkey's ruling AKP, stated: \\"We are facing a situation that has been monstrously planned and later tried to be covered up. It is a complicated murder.\\" Saudi Arabia has vowed it will conduct a thorough criminal investigation and deliver justice for Khashoggi, Turkish investigators have been faced with several delays from their Saudi counterparts. On 22 October, BBC reported that Turkish police had found a car with diplomatic number plates, abandoned in an underground car park in Istanbul. The car belonged to the Saudi consulate and permission was sought from the Saudi diplomats to search the car. Turkish media published a video from 3 October (the day after the disappearance) that apparently showed the staff of the consulate burning documents. Search of Saudi consul's residence On Sunday 7 October, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Saudi Arabian Ambassador Waleed A. M. Elkhereiji to demand for the second time permission to search the consulate building. Saudi officials continued to refuse that Turkish police could search the well in the Saudi consul's garden, but granted permission on 24 October (22 days after the assassination). Turkish newspaper H√ºrriyet reported on 26 October that police had found no DNA traces of Khashoggi in water samples taken from the well. Calling for an international investigation, at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City on 25 October, Agnes Callamard, UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, explained the Saudi officials implicated in the death of Khashoggi \\"are high enough to represent the state\\". \\"Even Saudi Arabia has admitted that the crime was premeditated ... From where I sit, this bears all the hallmarks of extrajudicial executions. Until I am proven otherwise I must assume that this was the case. It is up to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to prove that it was not.\\" Saudi public prosecutors visit Saudi public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb arrived in Istanbul on 28 October, days after he contradicted weeks of official Saudi statements by saying that Khashoggi's murder was premeditated. His trip came amid Turkish suggestions of \\"a lack of cooperation by the Saudi side\\" and alleged \\"attempts to spoil evidence\\". Mojeb held talks on 29 October with Istanbul's chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan at the √áaƒülayan courthouse. During the meeting, Saudi officials asked for the complete investigation folder, including evidence, statements and footage. The Turkish investigators presented the probe findings in a 150-page dossier but refused to share all the evidence they have compiled in the murder. And they repeated the request for the extradition of the 18 suspects to Turkey, although the Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir insisted on 27 October that the men would be tried on Saudi soil. They also repeated requests for confirmation on the whereabouts of Khashoggi's body, the identity of the \\"local cooperator\\" that the Saudis claim disposed of the body, and an update on the progress of a Saudi investigation of the 15 Saudi operatives who visited the Istanbul consulate at the time of the murder. Due to the lack of trust between the two countries, the meeting lasted only 75 minutes. Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu stated that \\"The whole truth must be revealed\\" and the visit will help in that direction. He also asked Saudis to complete the investigation sooner. Mojeb held a second round of talks with Fidan on 30 October, before inspecting the Saudi consulate in the Levent neighbourhood, where he left after spending a little over an hour. According to a source at the prosecutor's office, Fidan asked Mojeb to conduct another joint search at the consul-general's residence, because when Turkish investigators first entered the building in mid-October they were not allowed to search three locked rooms and were also not allowed to search a -deep well. The Saudis did not let firefighters descend into the well, and the search ended with police only able to obtain some water samples. President Erdoƒüan said the investigation needs to be completed swiftly: \\"This needs to be solved now; there is no point in excuses\\", and wants an extradition request for 18 suspects detained in KSA to be put on trial in Istanbul. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, also urged Saudi Arabia to reveal the location of Khashoggi's body: \\"I urge the Saudi authorities to reveal the whereabouts of his body without further delay or prevarication.\\" Mojeb was accused by Erdoƒüan of refusal to cooperate during his visit to discuss the investigation. Erdoƒüan stated that \\"The prosecutor came to Turkey to make excuses, make things difficult.\\" Mojeb had not shared any information to the Turkish investigators but wanted to take Khashoggi's mobile phone that was left outside the consulate with his fianc√©e when he entered. Disposing of the body On 31 October a senior Turkish official told The Washington Post that Turkish authorities were investigating the theory that Khashoggi's body was destroyed in acid on the grounds of the consulate or at the nearby residence of the Saudi consul general. The \\"biological evidence\\" discovered in the consulate garden supported the theory. Echoing the claim, Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Erdoƒüan in his ruling AK Party and a friend of Khashoggi, hinted in an article in the Turkish newspaper H√ºrriyet, published on 2 November, that the body was destroyed by dismembering and dissolving in acid: \\"We now see that it wasn't just cut up, they got rid of the body by dissolving it\\". On 4 March 2019, Al Jazeera Arabic released a documentary on the investigation of Khashoggi's murder and the subsequent coverup. In its coverage, the network states that the body was likely disposed of by being burnt in an oven at the Saudi consulate general's residence. An interview with the oven's builder revealed that it was designed to be \\"deep\\", and capable of withstanding temperatures over . The burning took three days and happened in parts. Afterwards, a large quantity of barbecue meat was prepared to cover the evidence of cremation. In a Washington Post op-ed Erdoƒüan described the murder as \\"inexplicable\\" and as a \\"clear violation and a blatant abuse of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations\\", arguing that not punishing the perpetrators \\"could set a very dangerous precedent.\\" He criticised Saudi inaction against the consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi, who had misled the media and had fled the country shortly afterwards. He warned that no-one should dare commit \\"such acts on the soil of a NATO ally again\\" and wrote: \\"As responsible members of the international community, we must reveal the identities of the puppet masters behind Khashoggi's killing and discover those in whom Saudi officials still trying to cover up the murder have placed their trust... We know that the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\\" He urged the international community to uncover the whole truth. Tampering with evidence On 5 November, Daily Sabah quoted a Turkish official that an 11-member \\"investigative team\\" had been sent by Saudi Arabia to Istanbul on 11 October. Chemist Ahmad Abdulaziz Aljanobi and toxicology expert Khaled Yahya al-Zahrani were sent as a part of the investigative team to erase the evidence and cover up. This was mentioned by the Turkish official as a sign of awareness about the crime among the top Saudi officials. The Saudi team had visited the consulate everyday between 11 and 17 October. On 15 October, Turkish police were allowed for the first time to enter the consulate. Audio tapes Speaking before his departure for Paris to attend the World War I armistice centenary, Erdoƒüan acknowledged the existence of audio recordings in a televised speech on 10 November to maintain the pressure from the international community on Saudi Arabia to reveal who ordered the murder of Khashoggi. He said: \\"We gave the tapes. We gave them to Saudi Arabia, to the United States, Germans, French and British, all of them.\\" It was the first time that he disclosed that the three European Union states had heard the recordings. Reuters reported that Turkey had multiple audio recordings of the Khashoggi incident. These recordings document Khashoggi's torture and death, as well as conversations from the days prior to the incident that Turkey had uncovered during its investigation. Based on these recordings, Turkey had concluded from an early stage that the killing was premeditated. Saud al- Qahtani was reported as having a major role throughout the recording. While attending the World War I centennial commemorations in France, Erdoƒüan discussed with President Donald Trump how to further respond to the killing. And a further closed-door meeting with Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres of the United Nations took place. President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed that more details were needed from KSA on Khashoggi's murder. Accordingly, they also agreed that the case should not cause further destabilization in the Middle East; and the fallout from the Khashoggi affair could create a way forward to find a resolution to the ongoing War in Yemen. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave public confirmation that Turkey had shared audio of the killing with world governments. The German government also confirmed it had received information from the Turkish authorities, but declined to elaborate. The British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt paid an official visit to KSA and called for its cooperation with a \\"credible\\" investigation into Khashoggi's killing. One of the assassins was heard saying \\"I know how to cut\\" on the audio tape. Charges On 15 November 2018, the Saudi Prosecutor's Office stated that 11 Saudi nationals had been indicted and charged with murdering Khashoggi and that five of the individuals who were indicted would face the death penalty since it had been determined they were directly involved in \\"ordering and executing the crime\\". Prosecutors alleged that shortly after Khashoggi entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul he was bound and then injected with an overdose of a sedative that resulted in his death. The prosecutors also alleged that his body had been dismembered and removed from the consulate by five of those charged in the killing and given to a local collaborator for disposal. Saudi officials continued to deny that the Saudi Royal Family was involved in, ordered, or sanctioned the killing. On 16 November 2018, several news organizations including The New York Times and The Washington Post reported that the CIA was unequivocal in assessing with \\"high confidence\\" that the crown prince Mohammad bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's assassination. The agency examined multiple sources of intelligence, including an intercepted phone call that the crown prince's brother Khalid bin Salman the then Saudi ambassador to the United States had with Khashoggi. A conclusion that contradicted previous Saudi government claims that the crown prince was not involved. A CIA spokesman and both the White House and the US State Department declined to comment. The Saudis issued a denial. On 20 November 2018, Trump issued the statement \\"On Standing with Saudi Arabia\\" and without citing further evidence he denied the CIA's conclusion: \\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\\" In a series of interviews President Trump said the crown prince denies his involvement \\"vehemently\\" and the CIA only has \\"feelings\\" and there is \\"no smoking gun\\" in the death. The next day H√ºrriyet columnist Abdulkadir Selvi wrote that the \\"CIA holds 'smoking gun phone call' of Saudi Crown Prince on Khashoggi murder\\", and that Gina Haspel, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has possession of an intercepted phone call in which crown prince Mohammad gives an order to his brother Khalid \\"to silence Jamal Khashoggi as soon as possible\\". \\"The subsequent murder is the ultimate confirmation of this instruction.\\" Citing the leaked CIA assessment, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mohammed bin Salman sent at least 11 text messages in the hours before and after the assassination on 2 October to his closest adviser Saud al-Qahtani who supervised the 15-man kill-team that was sent to Istanbul, and that Qahtani was in direct communication with the team's leader in Istanbul. The assessment also noted that Mohammed bin Salman had told his agents back in August 2017 that Khashoggi could be lured to a third country, if he could not be persuaded to return to the KSA. However, the message-exchange element of the report was contested by Saudi Arabia based on a confidential Saudi-commissioned investigation conducted by the private security firm Kroll. The investigation, which focused on a forensic examination of a cellphone belonging to Saud al-Qahtani, found that none of the messages exchanged on the day of the murder between Prince Mohammed and Mr. Qahtani concerned the murder. In September 2019, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared in an interview with the CBS \\"60 Minutes\\" program that was aired on 29 September 2019, denying that he had ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi or that he had prior knowledge about it but said that he bears all responsibility for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi because the incident took place under his watch. He also said that \\"once charges are proven against someone, regardless of their rank, it will be taken to court, no exception made.\\" On 25 March 2020, 20 Saudi nationals were reportedly indicted by Turkish prosecutors over the killing of Khashoggi. According to the prosecutor's office in Istanbul, a royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani, and Saudi's former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri were charged with inciting the murder; both had been investigated by Saudis in 2019 but acquitted or not charged. The suspects are believed to have fled Turkey, while Saudi Arabia has denied the Turkish claims for all the accused to be taken back to Turkey in order to answer for their crimes. According to Aljazeera, the charges were filed based on analysis of Khashoggi's accessories, witness testimonies, analysis of the suspects' phone records, including information on their whereabouts within and outside Turkey, as well as the consulate. Arrest warrants have been given out by the Turkish prosecutor for the accused. On 1 July 2020, a Turkish court announced to open the trial in absentia of the 20 indicted Saudi nationals. On 6 July 2020, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the 20 Saudi Arabian nationals. Alleged perpetrators Ahmad Asiri (right) and Mohammed bin Salman (left) in 2016 Al-Waqt news quoted informed sources as saying that Mohammad bin Salman had assigned Ahmad Asiri, the deputy head of the Saudi intelligence agency Riasat Al-Mukhabarat Al-A'amah and the former spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, with the mission to execute Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Another military officer with a great deal of experience in dealing with dissidents was the second candidate for the mission. On the same day, Turkish media close to the President published images of what it described as a 15-member \\"assassination squad\\" allegedly sent to kill Khashoggi, and of a black van later traveling from the Saudi consulate to the consul's home. On 17 October the Daily Sabah, a news outlet close to the Turkish president, published the names and pictures of the 15-member Saudi team apparently taken at passport control. Additional details about identities were also reported along with their aliases. According to one report, seven of the fifteen men suspected of killing Khashoggi are Mohammed bin Salman's personal bodyguards. The Daily Sabah outlet named and detailed: * Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb () (born 1971): a former diplomat in London, was photographed with Mohammad bin Salman on trips to Madrid, Paris, Houston, Boston and New York.Suspects in Khashoggi Case Had Ties to Saudi Crown Prince, by David D.

A top Pentagon post nominee of US President Donald Trump, Louis Bremer, was grilled on Capitol Hill by Senator Tim Kaine on 6 August 2020, over his firm Tier 1 Group's alleged involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Reportedly, the employees of the private military contracting firm, where Bremer is a member of the board of directors, trained some of the Saudi killers charged in the assassination of Khashoggi. In 2019, David Ignatius ‚Äì a Washington Post journalist ‚Äì reported in one of his articles about a similar warning given by the CIA to other government agencies in the US, about Tier 1 Group employees' involvement in the Khashoggi murder case. Bremer denies having any knowledge of the allegations or allegiance of his firm's employees in the Khashoggi assassination.  Trial and convictions  The trial was conducted in secret with diplomats and Khashoggi family members permitted to attend but not speak. The court adhered to the official line that the killing was not premeditated. According to the Saudi prosecutors, ten people were questioned and then released due to lack of evidence against them. A total of 11 people were put on trial by the court. The court conducted ten hearings that were not open to the public. A few foreign diplomats were allowed to attend the hearings after swearing to secrecy. CNN reported that lack of public access made it impossible to understand how the court decided the verdict. On 23 December 2019, five people were sentenced to death for carrying out Khashoggi's killing: * Fahad Shabib Albalawi * Turki Muserref Alshehri * Waleed Abdullah Alshehri * Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, intelligence officer * Dr Salah Mohammed Tubaigy, a forensic doctor from the Saudi interior ministry Three other defendants, unnamed , were sentenced to a combined total of 24 years in prison for \\"covering up this crime and violating the law\\". The following defendants were released: * Saud al-Qahtani, released without charge * Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy intelligence chief, released due to a lack of evidence * Mohammed al-Otaibi, Saudi Arabia's consul-general in Istanbul, released due to a lack of evidence The eight Saudis convicted in the verdict can appeal further. Clemency can be offered by Salah Khashoggi, the eldest son of Khashoggi. On 7 September 2020, the Criminal Court in Riyadh issued final convictions for eight people for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, in which five of them were given 20 years in prison, one received a 10-year sentence, and the other two would serve seven years in prison. The 20-year jail terms were given following Khashoggi's family decision to pardon them, the BBC added. Furthermore, none of the defendants' names was disclosed, according to The Guardian. However, Khashoggi's fianc√© went on social media to condemn Saudi Arabia's ruling, describing it as a total mockery of justice. A United Nations expert on human rights who carried out an investigation into the murder also criticized the ruling for lack of transparency or fairness. Response According to Amnesty International's Middle East Research Director Lynn Maalouf, the verdict was a whitewash and the organisation released a statement saying: \\"The verdict fails to address the Saudi authorities' involvement in this devastating crime or clarify the location of Jamal Khashoggi's remains ... only an international, independent and impartial investigation can serve justice for Jamal Khashoggi.\\" The United Nations rapporteur on summary executions, Agn√®s Callamard, described the sentence as a \\"mockery\\" of justice, since, according to her, it was an \\"extrajudicial execution for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible\\" and its masterminds walk free. Although Khashoggi's sons reportedly accepted the 2019 verdict, Khashoggi's children pardoned the five officials on 22 May 2020, which means the officials will be set free rather than executed. Aftermath Three weeks to the day after the death of Khashoggi, on 22 October 2018, his son and brother were summoned to a photo op with King Salman and the heir to the throne, at the Palace of Yamamah, in Riyadh. Salah bin Jamal Khashoggi and his uncle Sahel were received by the royals. Pictures of the event went viral, amid reports that Salah, who lives in Jeddah, has been banned from leaving the country since 2017. A family friend, Yehia Assiri, described the event as \\"a serious assault on the family\\". Nick Paton Walsh, a senior international correspondent, described it as \\"a remarkable display of the sustained and catastrophic disconnect between Riyadh and the outside world. As if PR is something you shoot yourself in the foot with.\\" On 24 October 2018, Salah Khashoggi, who holds dual Saudi-US citizenship, and his family left Saudi Arabia for the US. On 8 December 2018, Newsweek reported allegations that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had \\"maintained unofficial communications via a WhatsApp chat for the past two years and ... continued to speak in the wake of Khashoggi's killing.\\" Other alleged abduction attempts Following Jamal Khashoggi's killing and mutilation, several other exiled Saudi activists reported that the Saudi regime attempted to lure them into their embassies. Middle East Eye published claims from an unnamed source with knowledge of Saudi intelligence agencies that the murder is part of a larger operation of silently murdering critics of Saudi government by a death squad named \\"Tiger Squad\\", composed of the most trusted and skilled intelligence agents. According to the source, the Tiger Squad assassinates dissidents using varying methods such as planned car accidents, house fires, or poisoning clinics by injecting toxic substances into opponents when they attend regular health checkups. The alleged group members are recruited from different branches of the Saudi forces, directing several areas of expertise. According to Middle East Eye, five members were part of the 15-member death squad who were sent to murder Khashoggi. Exiled Saudi activist Omar Abdulaziz said he was approached earlier in 2018 by Saudi officials who urged him to visit the Saudi embassy in Ottawa, Canada with them to collect a new passport. The Saudi activist stated that the officials from the Saudi regime, \\"They were saying 'it will only take one hour, just come with us to the embassy. After Omar Abdulaziz refused, Saudi authorities arrested two of his brothers and several of his friends in Saudi Arabia. Abdulaziz secretly recorded his conversations with those officials, which were several hours long, and provided them to The Washington Post. The source interviewed by Middle East Eye also said the team planned to kill Omar Abdelaziz and claimed prince Mansour bin Muqrin was assassinated by the squad by shooting down his personal aircraft as he was fleeing the country on 5 November 2017 and made to appear as an accidental crash. Opposition Saudi scholar Abdullah Alaoudh (son of Salman al-Ouda) said he was subjected to a similar plot when he sent in a passport renewal application to the Saudi Embassy in Washington. Alaoudh said, \\"They offered me a 'temporary pass' that would allow me to return to Saudi Arabia.\\" Alaoudh suspected a trap and just let his passport expire. Prominent Saudi women's rights activist Manal al-Sharif also separately reported a similar event during her exile in Australia, having said: \\"If it weren't for the kindness of God I would have been [another] victim.\\" The Tiger Squad also reportedly killed Suleiman Abdul Rahman al-Thuniyan, a Saudi court judge who was murdered by an injection of a deadly virus into his body when he had visited a hospital for a regular health checkup. \\"One of the techniques the Tiger Squad uses to silence dissidents or opponents of the government is to 'kill them with HIV, or other sorts of deadly viruses'\\". In August 2020, a lawsuit filed by exiled former minister of state, Saad Aljabri, alleged that members of the Tiger Squad were sent to Canada to assassinate him two weeks after Khashoggi was killed, but that they were denied entry by Canadian border security. Additionally, Aljabri's son, Khalid, has claimed that his brother- in-law was rendered from Dubai to Saudi Arabia in September 2017, where he was coerced into trying to persuade his wife to attend the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Khalid suspects she would have been abducted had she gone there. Reactions Protest in front of the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. For 18 days, Saudi Arabian officials denied Khashoggi had died in the consulate, before indicating a team of Saudi agents had overstepped their orders to capture him when a struggle ensued leading to his death. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, said he believes the killing was premeditated and approved by the Saudi government, and sought extradition of the suspects. The United States' president, Donald Trump, expressed support for the Saudi government, reserving judgment about culpability. This created a bipartisan uproar in Congress, and 22 senators petitioned Trump to consider investigating whether Saudi Arabia should be sanctioned for human rights violations. Several countries called for a transparent investigation and condemned the killing. Allied Arab countries characterized the aftermath as a media campaign against Saudi Arabia. Germany, Norway and Denmark stopped the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia over the incident. Canada considered freezing its $13 billion General Dynamics Land Systems ‚Äì Canada arms deal, but so far has chosen to proceed with the deal. According to a U.S. senator, the Trump administration granted authorizations to US companies to share sensitive nuclear power information with Saudi Arabia shortly after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. In July 2019, Trump vetoed three bipartisan Congressional resolutions that would have halted arms sales. On 11 December 2018, Khashoggi was named as a person of the year by Time magazine for his work in journalism, along with other journalists who faced political persecution for their work. Time referred to Khashoggi, and the others, as a \\"Guardian of the Truth\\". In mid-August 2020, the Open Society Justice Initiative, part of Open Society Foundations, filed a lawsuit in the district court of New York demanding the release of the government's report on Jamal Khashoggi's murder, under the Freedom of Information Act. In July, they filed for a similar request, but received no response from the authority on the legal deadline.

Career He earned a BFA and an MFA in film from the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. During his studies, he worked as an editor and director of music videos at Riviera Films, as well as working for National Video Center and Betelgeuse, some of the top editing houses in New York. In 1996, he began work on his first feature film, Roads and Bridges (2000). In 1997 the film he produced for his MFA thesis, Fly, garnered several awards at NYU's First Run Film Festival for best directing, acting, editing, and cinematography. The film was later invited to the Directors Guild of America screening. Director Robert Altman saw Fly and invited Lim to Los Angeles to meet. After their meeting at the mixing session of The Gingerbread Man, Altman hired Lim to edit Cookie's Fortune. Lim then went on to partner with Altman by editing Killer App, a Fox TV pilot written by Garry Trudeau. Altman was one of the executive producers for Roads and Bridges. In 2002 Lim was part of Fox Searchlight‚Äôs Searchlab, a program for emerging directors. Toy, his short film about a Los Angeles sex worker, was selected to screen at Sundance Film Festival in 2003. Lim's screenplay The Achievers was a finalist for HBO‚Äôs Project Greenlight. The Achievers is a 2006 film he directed, starring Akie Kotabe, Dave Lee and Samantha Quan. In 2005, Lim won a grant from the NAATA media fund, which was founded to support Asian-American filmmakers. Frustrated with his inability to get distribution for Asian American films, in 2007 Lim went to explore filmmaking in South Korea. In 2010, Lim directed God is D ad, a road movie about young adults going to a comic conference in the late 1980s. The film won best picture at the Korean Film Festival of Los Angeles and Phoenix Fan Fusion (formerly Phoenix Comic Con). In 2019, he tried to market his latest film to the Chinese film market.

She is a professor of computer science at Aarhus University, and a member of the CHI Academy. B√∏dker is the author of the book Through the Interface: A Human Activity Approach To User Interface Design (Taylor & Francis, 1990), based on her dissertation work in 1987. It discusses human-computer interaction, and the role of user interfaces from the perspective of activity theory. Human-computer interaction conducted in purposeful human work is in focus. It focuses on the idea that as a user, you do not simply operate on a computer application but operate through onto other objects/subjects. B√∏dker was a researcher on the UTOPIA (in Danish, Uddannelse, teknik og produkt i arbejdskvalitetsperspektiv, which translates to training, technology and product in work quality perspective) Project from 1981 to 1985, which was initiated by the Nordic Graphic Union. Originally, the UTOPIA methodology sought to involve users in all aspects of design and development of technologies to be used in their jobs. With the subsequent advent of computer graphics workstations, UTOPIA's goal was to develop tools that leveraged and developed users‚Äô existing graphics skills. Attempts to explain the emerging WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) technology to graphic workers were unsuccessful. The users, who were accustomed to using code, could not conceptualize how a system could work without code. In response to this exchange, the team implemented the use of low-fidelity prototypes to convey the concept and for design development. This important outcome of the project provided methods that are now integral in human- computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), consensus participation, contextual design, and cooperative inquiry. The concept of the UTOPIA project was heavily influenced by Kristen Nygaard and is aligned with the strong tradition of Scandinavian design, emphasizing functionality and minimalism. These efforts would lead to B√∏dker's later work in cooperative design and participatory design.B√∏dker, S., Ehn, P., Sj√∂gren, D., & Sundblad, Y. (2000).

Dickison is a New Zealand museum curator, zoologist and Wikipedia editor. He was New Zealand's first Wikipedian at Large, in 2018‚Äì19, receiving a grant from the Wikimedia Foundation.  Early life  Dickison grew up in Christchurch. His father was an apprentice boilermaker, and his mother was a homemaker. His father encouraged his interest in curating and collecting. Dickison gained a PhD in zoology from Duke University in 2007. His dissertation subject was the allometry of giant flightless birds.  Career  He was curator of natural history at the Whanganui Regional Museum from 2013 to 2018. He became interested in Wikipedia in 2009. In 2012, he created a community group \\"Whanganui Wiki Wednesday\\" which met once a month to edit local pages on Wikipedia. He then began to run Wikipedia workshops around New Zealand. He has advocated for museums to engage with Wikipedia to get their collections accessible to the public. He argues that Wikipedia can also be a powerful tool for governments to share information and doing public outreach, citing the example of kauri dieback. In 2019, Dickison was a judge for the Voyager Media Awards.  Wikipedian at Large 2018  Dickison (front, left) leading a Wikipedia edit-a-thon at Auckland Museum, July 2018. In 2018, he received a $61,000 grant from the Wikimedia Foundation to become New Zealand's first Wikipedian-at-Large. The grant pays his salary, travel costs, and conference registration fees. He aims to address the gaps in New Zealand- related content on Wikipedia, such as the lack of articles on MƒÅori and women. He is also hoping to attract more women editors to Wikipedia to address the gender bias of article topics. As of 2018, he was travelling around New Zealand in his 4WD, which acts as a mobile office and entomology field station. In July 2018, his first stop was Auckland Museum. He went on to extended working stops, presentations and events at multiple institutions, in 16 different towns and cities across New Zealand, working with staff and the public. He recorded MƒÅori language pronunciations to add to Wikipedia articles, and called for locals to share their stories.  Critter of the Week  Mike presented about the Critter of the Week radio program in Bali, Indonesia at ESEAP 2018.

It is swift- flowing and is braided. In winter, parts of the Kavik (and the nearby Canning River) are covered with extensive ice sheets known as aufeis. The Kavik runs in a wide, flat alluvium-filled valley and is bordered by terraces at a number of levels. Scarring is seen at one site on the southern slope as a result of erosion after vegetation cover was removed by human activity. The Kavik River rises on the slopes of Mount Salisbury, in the Fairweather Range. It flows northwest for 80 miles before joining the Shaviovik River approximately 28 miles southwest of Flaxman Island. The river was named in 1947, by Georg Gryc of the United States Geological Survey, from the Inupiaq word meaning \\"wolverine\\", because a number of these animals were observed in the area. The river valley is known to provide a habitat for a population of wintering moose and musk oxen. Their presence in the Kavik River valley were identified in the 1970s during an environmental impact assessment for an application to run a natural gas pipeline across Federal-owned land.

An expert in both kinetics and the coordination chemistry of transition metals, he made significant advances in metal-complex catalysis. Biography Moiseev was born in Moscow. He studied organic chemistry at Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies (MITHT). After graduating in 1952, his first jobs were as an engineer, a junior researcher in physical chemistry, then a senior researcher in organic chemistry. From 1963, he worked at the N. S. Kurnakov (IGIC) of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), Moscow, as head of the laboratory of metal- complex catalysis and coordination chemistry. From 2003 onward, he was a professor at the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas (RGUNG Gubkin). He also served as chairman of the Scientific Council for Gas Chemistry, RAS, and vice-president of the Russian Chemical Society. Research By developing new principles for the design of catalytic systems he created highly efficient catalysts that enabled compounds of commercial importance to be synthesized from cheap hydrocarbons. His concerns for efficiency and choice of raw materials were informed by environmental as well as economic considerations. His innovations became the basis of industrial methods for the production of acetaldehyde from ethylene, the synthesis of formic acid from carbon monoxide and water, the hydrogenation of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, and the synthesis of isoprene. He discovered Palladium catalysts that have selective effects under mild conditions, and synthesized new classes of inorganic compounds. Possibly his most famous discovery was the Pd(II)-catalyzed acetoxlyation of ethylene to vinyl acetate in 1960, which has become known as Moiseev's reaction. The reaction proceeds only in the presence of sodium acetate; Moiseev used benzoquinone to regenerate the Pd(II) catalyst. > CH2=CH2 + 2 CH3COONa + PdCl2 ‚ü∂ CH2=CHOOCCH3 + 2 NaCl + Pd + > CH3COOH Honours and awards In 2002 he received the State Prize of the Russian Federation in the field of science and technology. In 2011 he was awarded the Prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of science and technology. He also received the orders of the Red Banner of Labor (1986), Honor (1999) and Friendship (2009). The Royal Society of Chemistry awarded Moiseev the Centenary Prize for 2006/7. In 2012, he was awarded the Demidov Prize for his contribution to the chemistry of organoelement compounds, petrochemistry, and carbene chemistry, and the RAS Chugaev Prize for his work on coordination compounds in industrially important redox reactions. In 2013 he received the RAS Mendeleev Medal for outstanding work in the field of catalysis and energy-saving technologies. He became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1990, and an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1992. He was a full member of the Academy of Sciences, Arts and Literature in Paris, the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the Academia Europaea.

From 1901, he worked in the Ministry of Finance and was director of the Business Bank. He was deputy of the Serbian Parliament from 1906. From 1914 to 1917, he served as Minister of Economy. Again minister at the end of 1918, he participated in the Paris Peace Conference, 1919.

He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the governments of Ljubomir Davidoviƒá (for a few months of 1924), Velimir Vukiƒáeviƒá and Anton Koro≈°ec, last in the parliamentary term. Royal dictatorship With the proclamation of the 6 January Dictatorship in 1929, Marinkoviƒá entered the cabinet chaired by the former commander of the Royal Guard, General Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá. He replaced ≈Ωivkoviƒá as Prime Minister in April 1932, with the aim of changing the image of the dictatorship thanks to his experience as a veteran deputy and distinguished member of the Democratic Party. During his short tenure as the head of the government, he softened political repression, allowing contacts between the old parties. His program, which was left unimplemented by his early dismissal, included the liberalization of the electoral law passed in 1931 and the revision of the 1931 Constitution, approved during the dictatorship. He publicly mentioned the possibility of calling a referendum on the federalization of the country, which upset both some of his ministers and the King, who relieved him in July 1932. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by his former Minister of the Interior, Milan Sr≈°kiƒá, opposed to the rapid liberalization advocated by Marinkoviƒá.

The special features an unsuspecting participant, Phil, taking part in a faked medical experiment to increase his bravery and empathy before he is put in a situation where he must decide whether to take a bullet for a stranger or save his own life. Premiering on 19 October 2018, Sacrifice was the first of Brown's specials made exclusively for Netflix. The show received mixed reviews, with criticism of the ethics of manipulating the participant. Synopsis The American subject Phil is recruited for the show because of his strong opinions that illegal immigrants are a threat to America. Phil is told that he is taking part in a medical experiment in the UK, which Derren Brown has helped develop. Phil has a chip implanted in his neck and must use a meditation app Turbine daily. The app encourages him to be decisive, with its distinctive noise acting as a trigger. After Phil uses the app for a while, Brown meets with him and uses psychological techniques to make his left hand feel numb. At Brown's direction, he pushes a needle through the skin on the back of his hand. Phil is next asked to jump off a cliff into water, despite his fear of both heights and open water. At Brown's encouragement, and use of the Turbine app noise, Phil is able to stand at the edge of the platform, but after two attempts is still unable to jump. Brown next brings Phil in for the results of a DNA test‚ÄîPhil is surprised to find that little of it is from the UK or America. Brown then gets Phil to stare into the eyes of a stranger of another race for four minutes. He tears up and asks the stranger for a hug. Phil is told that the experiment has ended and resumes his life in America. Phil flies to Los Angeles and takes a cab to meet his friend, who has told him that he has a free trip to Las Vegas. The driver is an actor. Upon the pretence of the car breaking down, Phil is taken to a bar filled with a biker gang played by actors. One member comes up to Phil and starts a conversation. The driver leaves and pretends to be at a mechanic, saying that Phil needs to take a taxi down there. The biker offers Phil a ride. Two men enter the bar and are forcefully ushered out by members of the gang, who claim Mexicans are not allowed at the bar. As Phil gets into their truck, the bikers spot the men knocking their bikes over. They chase after them and Phil is told to stay in the car while the bikers deal with the situation. They restrain the two men and force them to admit that they are illegal immigrants. A biker pulls out a gun. At this moment, the radio in the car plays the Turbine app's tone and Phil steps out of the car. He stands in front of the Mexican who the gun is aimed at and pleads with the biker. The biker issues an ultimatum, saying that there is one bullet in the gun and it is for Phil or the Mexican. He counts down from five and shoots Phil. The bullet is a fake and Brown steps in to explain to Phil that the events were staged. Production Sacrifice was the first special by Brown which was produced solely for online streaming platform Netflix. Previously Brown's specials were shown on the UK Channel 4, and his works Miracles and Pushed to the Edge were broadcast on both Channel 4 and Netflix. Sacrifice was designed to be lighter in tone than Pushed to the Edge, with an \\"ultimately humanitarian message\\". A trailer for the special was released on 10 October 2018. The special was released on 19 October. Following the show's filming, Brown introduced Phil to Steven and Chris, the subjects of his previous specials Apocalypse and Pushed to the Edge, so that Phil would have \\"a network of people who‚Äôd shared a similar experience\\". Brown reported that the experience was \\"transformative\\" for Phil, with whom his contact was continuing, as \\"after care is an important part of [the show]\\". Analysis Amy Glynn of Paste discusses the idea that \\"reality is a collage of illusions\\", linking Brown's experiment with numbing Phil's hand to examples of powerful placebo effects. Glynn opines that the show evidences that beliefs change through discovering one's own capability. Angelica Florio of Bustle describes Phil's initial views as \\"racist\\" and compares them to Donald Trump's statements about Mexican immigrants during his 2016 presidential campaign. Florio describes Phil's views as \\"problematic\\" despite his lack of intent to harm anyone. Brown said that he endeavoured to \\"avoid anything overtly political\\" in the special, personally opining that \\"truth and humanity lies\\" between left-wing and right-wing discourse. Glynn notes that the show raises many questions about personal narratives, the effect of fear, and empathy. Brown says that the show is \\"about stepping out of the narratives we live by\\", such as moral and political narratives. Reception Sacrifice received mixed reviews. Fiona Sturges of The Guardian takes issue at the way Phil is treated by Brown as a \\"guinea pig\\". Josh Sorokach of Decider similarly objects to Brown's manipulation of Phil, and Tilly Pearce of Metro describes the show as inhabiting \\"an emotional grey area\\". Sturges gives the show an overwhelmingly negative review, saying that Brown has \\"restyled himself as an all-powerful, egocentric sage\\". Criticising Brown's \\"God complex\\", Sturges writes that his monologues make him sound like a \\"sanctimonious knobhead\\". Sorokach describes the show as \\"an unsettling psychological experiment you'll either love or hate\\". Sorokach believes that the tone is \\"more cringe-inducing than uplifting\\" and says Brown is \\"more concerned about vanity than [...] innovation\\". However, the special has received positive commentary. Pearce gives the episode a five star rating, praising Brown's \\"amazing deal of empathy\\". Pearce compliments the \\"nerve-wracking\\" climax and the moral conclusion. Glynn describes the special as \\"bizarrely gripping\\" despite being ethically questionable. Florio praises that it \\"tackles one of the most prominent racial divides in the country head-on\\".

It term also covers research, training, and services in ways that improve mental health for deaf people. These services consider those with a variety of hearing levels and experiences with deafness focusing on their psychological well-being. The National Association of the Deaf has identified that specialized services and knowledge of the Deaf increases successful mental health services to this population. States such as North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama have specialized Deaf mental health services. The Alabama Department of Mental Health has established an office of Deaf services to serve the more than 39,000 deaf and hard of hearing person who will require mental health services. There are multiple models of deafness; Deaf mental health focuses on a cultural model in that people who are deaf view themselves as part of a socio-cultural linguistic community, rather than people with a medical deficit or disability. Accordingly, providing deaf mental-health care to people of the Deaf community requires services from clinicians, doctors, and interpreters who are trained with this perspective and the inclusion of deaf professionals in this system of health care. Deaf children language development Early access to language in deaf children is important for normal development of language. The critical period of language development is an important part of the linguistic development of all children - and delaying access to language input can lead to mental health concerns. Deprivation of language can negatively affect mental health and in severe cases can cause language deprivation syndrome. Child psychiatrist Sanjay Gulati is a strong proponent for the importance of language access in deaf children so that they can establish a fundamental first language. Access to auditory and visual language is important, and availability differs based on each child's abilities. Approximately 40% of deaf children also have additional disabilities. Many states have deaf schools and institutions that provide appropriate language models along with mental health services for their students and those in the surrounding Deaf communities. The Lexington School for the Deaf in Queens, New York, provides a variety of educational and social services for the deaf. The Texas School for the Deaf in Austin, Texas, also provides a focus on mental health for students. Deaf children in mainstream schools may be more neglected in the classroom than their hearing peers. It is also more common for deaf children to have a harder time making friends. Bullying can occur frequently among children who are deaf or hard of hearing, which can lead to negative mental health outcomes. Education and access For a deaf person, obtaining access to proper medical treatment is challenging and they face a variety of obstacles in communication and access. This can include the way in which medical professionals initiate patient's various health exams without prior modification suitable for deaf individuals. Communication challenges and lack of doctor awareness of the culture and language of the deaf can lead deaf patients to avoid making medical appointments. An increase in the number of professionals who are trained in American Sign Language and have experience with Deaf culture increase positive mental health outcomes for deaf people. Aging and deafness Age-related hearing loss gradually occurs in many people as they get older, typically affecting those over the age of 65. This type of hearing loss can lead to feelings of embarrassment and isolation due to the fact that those affected may no longer be able to hear family, friends, or simple everyday sounds. Those with hearing loss are less likely to want to engage in social activities due to frustration over not being able to hear. A study conducted by the National Council of Aging (NCOA) showed that a large portion of elders with hearing loss who were studied, reported symptoms of lasting depression. Higher rates of exclusion from social and employment opportunities due to higher rates of miscommunication, making deaf adults more susceptible to mental illnesses. Studies have found that when a person becomes deaf at an older age, it has a less extreme impact on their mental health than it does when hearing loss begins at an earlier age. However, those who were either born deaf or lost their hearing at a younger age and then age as a deaf person face some particularly difficult challenges. When a non-deaf person ages, isolationist tendencies are generally increased. This increase is even more drastic for deaf people. Furthermore, many technological advancements that are heavily dependent on auditory communication also present challenges to deaf people. Knowledge of professionals The type and onset of deafness may cause different types of language disfluencies, diagnoses, and treatments of clients who are deaf. Cultural knowledge, language skills (e.g., fluency in American Sign Language or access to trained interpreters), and other social- cultural factors are part of the deaf mental health access model. Lack of knowledge about Deaf culture and sign language among mental health professionals can make it difficult for deaf people to access appropriate services. American Sign Language interpreting and training for mental health Sign language interpreter The National Association of the Deaf has eight recommendations for qualifications of interpreters working in mental health settings: # Fluency in American Sign Language # Fluency in English and register choices # Culturally competent # Attending a comprehensive training curriculum for mental health interpreting # Mentoring with experienced mental health interpreters (at least 50 hours) # Individual or group supervision and peer consultation # High standards of ethical practice # Knowledge of relevant ethical literature or decision-making models in interpreting Specific knowledge and training in mental health contexts is necessary for adequate sign language interpreting for mental health clients. Accordingly, the State of Alabama requires \\"Certification of mental health interpreters for persons who are deaf\\" for interpreters to work in mental health contexts, and this certification must be renewed yearly by either: a) working 40 hours in clinical settings; b) attending 40 hours of training; or c) a combination of work in clinical settings and training equaling 40 hours. To provide the opportunity for education and training, the Alabama Department of Mental Health's Office of Deaf Services directed by Steve Hamerdinger established the Alabama's Mental Health Interpreter Training Project.  Attitudes about the use of interpretation in psychotherapy  According to psychologist Camilla Williams, \\"Deaf people enter therapy with the same problems as hearing people.\\" As members of a linguistic minority, the ability to receive psychotherapy in their preferred language, independent of a translator can be difficult. Within the Deaf community, sign language fluency is considered very important when choosing a therapist. While it is preferred to have a therapist familiar with Deaf culture and fluent in American Sign Language the reality is that there are very few therapists having the specific skills necessary. This impacts the ability of both the client and the therapist to communicate effectively allowing for a therapeutic alliance to be formed. The addition of a translator shifts the dynamic between client and therapist. Research shows that while a well-qualified translator is appreciated it often creates additional challenges. It can be frustrating when the therapist believes that the translator is only for the client‚Äôs comfort and not benefiting both parties.

Endre S√°gv√°ri, born Endre Spitzer (4 November 1913 ‚Äì 27 July 1944), was a Hungarian lawyer, communist and anti-fascist activist. Biography S√°gv√°ri was born into a Jewish family in Budapest. He became interested in Marxism as a student, and joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP). In 1940, he left the MSZDP for the then illegal Hungarian Communist Party (MKP). From the 1930s, S√°gv√°ri participated in the organization of anti-war demonstrations, and after the German occupation of Hungary during World War II, he joined the underground resistance. Eventually, S√°gv√°ri was tracked down by the authorities, and in July 1944 he was surrounded by four gendarmes in a caf√© in Budapest. After pulling his gun on the gendarmes and wounding three of them, he was shot to death. Legacy Statue of Endre S√°gv√°ri in Mak√≥. During the years of the Hungarian People's Republic, S√°gv√°ri was highlighted as a legendary leader and martyr of the anti-fascist cause, with several streets and institutions being named after him as well as monuments being erected to his memory. L√°szl√≥ Krist√≥f, one of the gendarmes involved in the killing of S√°gv√°ri, was arrested and sentenced to death in a 1959 show trial. After the fall of communism, attempts have been made to portray S√°gv√°ri as an ordinary criminal rather than an anti-fascist martyr; streets named after him have been renamed, and monuments and other memorials to him have been removed and taken down. In 2006, the conviction of L√°szl√≥ Krist√≥f was overturned. This process has been criticized by oppositional forces in Hungary, with Tam√°s Krausz, professor of history at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest, writing that the post-communist portrayal of S√°gv√°ri \\"reflects a wider tendency across eastern and central Europe to rehabilitate those who collaborated with the Nazis and prewar fascists, and criminalise those who resisted them.\\" References Category:1913 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Politicians from Budapest Category:People from the Kingdom of Hungary Category:Jewish anti-fascists Category:Anti-war activists Category:Deaths by firearm in Hungary Category:Hungarian communists Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Hungarian lawyers Category:Hungarian resistance members Category:Hungarian Communist Party politicians Category:Social Democratic Party of Hungary politicians Category:People murdered in Hungary Category:Jewish socialists Category:20th- century lawyers ","title":"Endre S√°gv√°ri"},{"id":"58828768","text":"Mihaela BuzƒÉrnescu was the defending champion, but chose not to participate.

The case also received the names of \\"The House of Horror\\" or \\"The Butchers of Ecatepec\\". Active in Ecatepec de Morelos, State of Mexico, from 2012 to 2018, the pair are suspected to have committed between 10 and 20 murders, and have also confessed to cannibalizing the bodies of their victims . The pair were apprehended on October 4, 2018 when transporting human remains in a baby stroller.  Background  They were both born in L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Michoac√°n, within a five-year age gap. Juan Carlos' mother was a single mother, who allegedly often dressed him as a girl, brought men to her house and forced her son to watch her sexual encounters. Also, he declared that in his childhood, he suffered sexual abuse by another woman who at the time was his caretaker. When he was 10 years old, he fell from the stairs and suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. Patricia Mart√≠nez was born to a poor family, and was manipulative. She was diagnosed with a border intelligence disorder linked to intellectual disability. She was a prostitute at the time. The couple met in 2008, when Patricia worked as waitress at a restaurant, of which Juan Carlos was a regular client. They initiated a relationship and, although he presumed to be an \\"assassin\\", she decided to move with him. The couple had four children during their 10-year relationship. They opened a family business where they sold clothing, perfume and cell phones.  Crimes  Their first victim, according to Patricia's declaration, was a 22-year-old woman who Juan Carlos lured with job promises. In their house, Hern√°ndez led her to their bathroom where he raped, beheaded and dismembered her. Mart√≠nez kept their children outside the house while the murder occurred. After the murder, Mart√≠nez partially cooked the body and ate it with her husband. Their second victim was a teen girl who lived next to them, who suffered an inhalants addiction; they allegedly lured her with promises of wealth. Like the first victim she was also raped, beheaded and dismembered in their bathroom. Patricia cooked the victim's body in chilli.

He was a son of Walter of Civitate and brother of Amicus of Giovinazzo. Unlike several members of his family, including his brother, he remained loyal to Duke Robert Guiscard throughout the latter's life. In December 1081, Peter and Count Robert I of Loritello witnessed the renunciation by Abbot Desiderius (the future Pope Victor III) of the claims of the Abbey of Montecassino over the Abbey of Santa Maria a Mare on Tremiti. On Duke Robert's death in 1085, Peter recognised Roger Borsa as his successor and in August 1086 accompanied him on his visit to Sicily, which was then in the process of being conquered by the Normans from its Muslim rulers. He attended the ducal court again in 1092, witnessing a charter of Duke Roger, but the remoteness of Lesina in northern Apulia seems generally to have kept him out of the civil strife of the kingdom, into which his brother Amicus was frequently drawn. Peter was succeeded as count of Lesina by a son, Rao (fl. 1099). Richard, the first count of Manoppello, may have been a son.

At one time the largest circulating paper in the county, its current circulation is 2,650. It is part of New SV Media, which also publishes the King City Rustler and Hollister Free Lance. It is edited by Ryan Cronk.  History  The newspaper was founded on January 24,1891 by Thomas Renison as an independent weekly. Renison had immigrated from Ireland at the age of 18, settling in the Bay Area in 1868. While living in Gonzales he established the Gonzales Tribune, publishing its first volume on January 24, 1891. He served as a presidential elector with the Democratic State Central Committee, resigning in 1892. Renison would run it for only a few years; while editing it he was studying law, and in 1894, after passing the bar, he announced that he was moving to Salinas, California, where he established a law practice, served several terms as mayor and was elected to state assembly. By 1893, the Gonzales Tribune had become the largest newspaper in the county, a title it would only hold for a short time. For some time it was edited by H. R. Farley. Around Halloween of 1898, Farley began to write a series of articles in the paper attacking the current Monterey County Sheriff, who had been accused of using names on local tombstones to embezzle county funds intended to feed and clothe prisoners. The articles hurt the reputation of the Sheriff, and Farley put himself up as challenger in the next election, using the paper as a campaign vehicle, and winning in a heated contest. Farley's ascension into the position of Sheriff, however, would be his end; less than a year into his term his attempted apprehension of a drunken resident led to his murder. The Gonzales Tribune was sold, along with other South County Newspapers products, in 1995 to Rochelle, Illinois-based News Media Corporation. On July 1, 2019, California publisher New SV Media Inc. purchased the Tribune, ending several decades of out-of-state ownership. On April 1, 2020, it was renamed the Salinas Valley Tribune. The new logo had been in development before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the timing of the announcement was coincidental, publisher Jeanie Johnson said.

Louis was killed during the Battle of Auberoche in 1345. Life Louis was a son of Aymar V of Valentinois and Sibylle de Baux. He succeeded his father as Count of Valentinois from 1339. During the English Gascon campaign of 1345, Poitiers led a French army of 7,000 men besieging the castle of Auberoche, east of P√©rigueux. The small Anglo-Gascon garrison was commanded by Frank van Hallen. Henry, Earl of Derby, with an initial relief force of 1,200 English and Gascon soldiers: 400 men-at-arms and 800 mounted archers, arrived to relieve the siege. The French encampment was divided in two, with the majority of the soldiers camped close to the river between the castle and village while a smaller force was situated to prevent any relief attempts from the north. Derby launched a three-pronged assault on the French encampment, as the French were having their evening meal, and complete surprise was achieved. His longbowmen fired from the treeline to the west into the French position. The French, packed tightly into the narrow meadow, not expecting an attack and unarmoured, are reported to have taken heavy casualties from this. Adam Murimuth, a contemporary chronicler, estimates French casualties at this stage at around 1,000. While the French were confused, and distracted by this attack from the west, Derby made a cavalry charge with his 400 men-at-arms from the south. They had some 200‚Äì300 yards (200‚Äì300 m) across flat ground to cover to reach the French. French soldiers struggled into their armour and their commanders rallied their still superior forces. A small number of Anglo-Gascon infantry had followed a path in the woods to emerge in the French rear and now attacked from the north west. The fighting continued in the area of the camp for some time. Halle, realising that the French troops guarding his exit from the castle were either distracted or had been drawn off to join the fighting, sallied with all the mounted men he could muster. Taken in the rear, the French defence collapsed and they routed, pursued by the English cavalry. French casualties were heavy, described by modern historians as \\"appalling\\", \\"extremely high\\", \\"staggering\\", and \\"heavy\\". Many French nobles were taken prisoner; lesser men were, as was customary, put to the sword. Louis of Poitiers, died of his wounds. Surviving prisoners included the second in command, Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain, two counts, seven viscounts, three barons, the seneschals of Clermont and Toulouse, a nephew of the Pope and so many knights that they were not counted.

Diocese of Albara  Located on the plateau Jabal al-Sumaq, Albara was a strategically important town to the southeast of Antioch in the Middle Ages. The crusaders captured Antioch on 3 June 1098. Pope Urban II legate, Adhemar of Le Puy, restored the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of the town, John the Oxite, and confirmed the Patriarch's authority over both the Greek and the Latin clergy. The crusaders' two most important leaders, Bohemond, Prince of Taranto, and Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, wanted to secure the rule of Antioch for themselves. Raymond invaded the Jabal al-Smmaq and captured Albara on 25 September 1098. Albara had not been an Orthodox episcopal see, but Raymond established a Latin bishopric in the town, which thus became the first Roman Catholic diocese in Syria. After consulting with his chaplains and commanders, Raymond appointed a Proven√ßal priest, Peter of Narbonne, as the first bishop of Albara. Raymond's chaplain, Raymond of Aguilers, recorded that Raymond's troops \\"gave thanks to God\\" after Peter's appointment because \\"they wished to have a Roman bishop in the eastern church to look after their affairs\\". Historian Bernard Hamilton proposes that Peter was actually appointed for political and social reasons, because late-11th-century European rulers could not administer their realms without the assistance of high- ranking clergymen. Indeed, Raymond granted half of Albara and the nearby region to the Bishop, most probably to enable Peter to rule the whole territory on his behalf. The Gesta Francoruma reliable contemporaneous primary sourcerecorded that Peter went to Antioch where John the Oxite consecrated him.  Archdiocese of Apamea  Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, who had ruled the Principality of Antioch on Bohemond's behalf since 1104, captured Apamea in August 1106. Apamea had been an Orthodox metropolitan see, which ranked fourth among the suffragans of the patriarchs of Antioch, but no sources imply the presence of an Orthodox prelate in the town at the time of its conquest. The Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Bernard of Valence, promoted Peter of Narbonne to the rank of archbishop and transferred his see to Apamea. The first extant document styling Peter as \\"archbishop of Albara and archbishop of Famia\\" (or Apamea) was issued in 1110. Peter and his successors used both titles interchangeably for decades, but the reference to Albara disappeared from their style after about 1144. No documents refer to secular rulers in Albara, suggesting that the archbishops continued to administer the town and its region. The archbishops of Apamea also had a suffragan bishops, after the crusaders captured Baniyas and made it an episcopal see in 1109.  Titular see  Nur ad-Din captured Apamea in 1149, but it remained a titular archbishopric. The titular archbishop lived in Latakia and had his own chapel in the town in 1223. In that year, Pope Honorius III authorized him to celebrate Mass in the chapel.

Education and career  Yang was born on 22 December 1932 into a peasant family in Qingdao, Shandong, Republic of China, and moved to Taiwan with his parents in 1947. When he was little, a fortune-teller predicted that he would not become an educated person, and he was determined to prove the prediction wrong. After graduating from National Taiwan University (NTU) with a bachelor's degree in psychology, he became a faculty member at NTU in 1959. Yang later went to study at the University of Illinois in the United States and earned his Ph.D. in 1969. He returned to teach at NTU afterwards and became the first person in Taiwan with a Ph.D. in psychology. He served twice as chair of NTU's psychology department, and became a research fellow at the Institute of Ethnology of Academia Sinica in 1972. He was appointed Vice President of Academia Sinica in 1996, and was elected an academician in 1998.  Academic contributions  Yang is considered the founder of indigenized Chinese psychology. He proposed the distinction between indigenized versus westernized psychology. He argued that Western psychology, largely based on research done in American or Western societies, is in fact the \\"indigenous psychology for Americans or Westerners\\"‚Äîit is based on Western values and traditions and may not be applicable in non-Western countries. Beginning in the 1970s, he conducted research on Chinese cultural societies, studying unique phenomena such as yuanfen, filial piety, guanxi, and face. His theories and research tools have been adopted by scholars in Taiwan and abroad.  Publications  Yang wrote or edited more than 20 books. He also published more than 130 research papers, in both Chinese and English, in psychology journals. His most influential books, recognized as essential reference works in Chinese psychology, are: *Chinese Characteristics () *Chinese Psychology and Behavior () *Exploring Chinese Psychology Through Indigenous Research ()  Political activism  During the Martial Law era, Yang was a strong advocate for political freedom and democracy and was frequently critical of the Kuomintang government. He and three other liberal scholars, Hu Fo, , and Chang Chung-tung, were considered the \\"Four Bandits\\" or \\"Four Poisonous Weeds\\" by the government. After President Chiang Ching-kuo lifted the martial law in 1987, they established the political group Taipei Society (, Chengshe) in 1989. Yang served as the founding president of the society, which aimed to promote \\"freedom, fairness, diversity, and the equitable distribution of wealth\\". He called for the restoration of constitutional rule and the exclusion of military personnel from the government cabinet. He participated in the Wild Lily student movement for democracy in 1990.  Personal life  In 1962, Yang married Li Pen-hua (), the daughter of Lieutenant General Li Li-po (). After Yang suffered a stroke, President Tsai Ing-wen and Secretary-General Chen Chu visited him at the nursing home in May 2018.

After word spread that Carmichael avoided arrest from two officers who ordered him to leave a school where he was registering voters after he challenged them to do so,Carmichael and the other SNCC activists who stayed with him in the county were inspired to create the LCFO with Hulett (who, since the banning of the NAACP in the state, had been active in Fred Shuttlesworth's Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights), and other local leaders. As the Voting Rights Act of 1965 allowed African Americans to register to vote, the objective of the party was to register African Americans in a county that was 80% black. Hulett, who was LCFO's chairperson, was one of the first two African American voters whose registration was successfully processed in Lowndes County.

The idea for the logo came from SNCC field secretary Ruth Howard.Jeffries, p. 152; Ogbar, p. 76 The LCFOs symbol of a black panther was later adopted by the Black Panther Party founded by Bobby Seale and Huey P.

A Republican, he is a member of the United States House of Representatives, for . He was elected in 2018. Early life and education Hern graduated from Dover High School in Dover, Arkansas, in 1980, and Arkansas Tech University in 1986. He worked at Rockwell International and attended the Georgia Institute of Technology, studying for a Ph.D. in astronautical engineering.  Career  After the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Hern had difficulty finding a job, and became a McDonald's franchisee. He bought his first McDonald's in North Little Rock, Arkansas in 1997. He sold the North Little Rock franchise in 1999 to move to Muskogee, Oklahoma, where he bought two franchises. He expanded his business to own eighteen franchises in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area.  U.S. House of Representatives   2018 election  After Jim Bridenstine resigned from the United States House of Representatives in 2018 to become administrator of NASA, Hern ran to succeed him in in the 2018 elections. Hern advanced to the runoff, where he defeated Tim Harris. He then advanced to the general election, where he defeated Democratic candidate Tim Gilpin. Outgoing Governor Mary Fallin then appointed Hern to serve out the balance of Bridenstine's third term. She was able to do so because under Oklahoma law, if a House seat falls vacant in an even-numbered year and the incumbent's term is due to end the following year, the governor can appoint someone to serve the remainder of the term. Accordingly, Hern was duly sworn into the House on November 13. Tenure During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Hern's KTAK Corporation received assistance between $1 million and $2 million in federally backed small business loans from American Bank and Trust as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. KTAK stated they would retain 220 jobs. Their loan was seen as notable, since Hern is a vocal supporter against deficit spending; in 2018, discussing a balanced budget, he said \\"While there is no easy fix to this, the first step is clear- stop adding to it.\\" In 2020, he said \\"This isn't a bailout. It's a repayment of what the government has taken away from American workers and businesses.\\" KTAK operates franchises. During the Paycheck Protection Program negotiations, Hern pushed to increase the amount of aid going to franchises.

She was called the Ambassador of A√Øta, a traditional Bedouin genre of song, and known for her purist renditions of the A√Øta Hasbaouia in its classical form. Life and career Fatema El Kout was born in 1937 to a family of Sufis in Douar Hammoun, a village in the Essaouira region of Morocco. Her mother died when she was young, and she was married off at the age of 12. Upset, she managed to escape to her aunt in Essaouira and obtain a divorce. Here she met Sheikh Jilali, who began to train her in the Aita, and encouraged her to become a chanteuse. She faced family disapproval upon becoming a folk singer, with her father threatening to kill her. She fled to Safi with Jilali, whom she married in the 1970s. She established a music troupe that would accompany her for nearly 25 years. Under the name Hamounia, she began to be known for her renditions of the Aita repertoire. In the 1970s, she attained great popularity for her songs Mal hbibi malou and li bgha hbibi. In demand to perform at ceremonies of the Moroccan social elites, she was also invited to sing at the wedding of King Hassan II's daughter, Lalla Hasna, in 1994 at Fez. Hamounia was a great exponent of the Hasbaouia mode of Aita, which is in danger of extinction as the number of singers capable of interpreting it falls. Under her tutelage, several talented musicians have emerged, such as Khadija Margoum, another doyenne of Aita, Hajib, a cha√¢bi performer, and Cheikha Tsunami. Hamounia died on 2 July 2013 from respiratory illness, and was interred at the Saada cemetery in Safi.

Life Frank was the commander of the garrison of Auberoche Castle in 1345, that was under siege by a French army under the command of Louis of Poitiers. The French siege army was attacked by a relieving Anglo-Gascon army under the command of Henry, Earl of Derby and when Hallen realised that the French troops guarding the castle were distracted or had been drawn off to join the fighting, Hallen sallied with all the mounted men he could muster from the castle. Hallen drove into the rear of the French forces, which were routed and pursued by the English cavalry. Hallen was appointed on 20 June 1349, the Seneschal of Gascony and fought at the battle of Poitiers in 1356. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1359.

It was directed by Stephen Robert Morse and Nick Hampson, and co-written by Morse and Maria Springer.  Background and production  Geert Wilders, a right-wing populist politician in the Netherlands, decided to run for Prime Minister of the Netherlands in the 2017 Dutch general election. Stephen Robert Morse was fascinated by this, particularly after American politician Donald Trump's successful presidential election and the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. He, along with Nick Hampson and Maria Springer, decided to make a documentary which follows Wilders campaign, and compares him to Donald Trump. \\"Wilders' was the first big election in the world after Trump, which is what drew us to the project in the first place. We wanted to make a movie about an election that involved an outsider,\\" Hampson said. Stephen Robert Morse and Nick Hampson co-directed the documentary, and Maria Springer co-wrote it. The soundtrack was composed by Harry Davidson, a music scholar from the University of Oxford. The filming began in December 2016, a couple of days after a trial where Wilders was convicted of hate speech, which concluded with the judge, Hendrik Steenhuis, deciding that the court would not impose any punishment on Wilders following the trial. The makers of the documentary wanted to learn the details of Wilders' viewpoint and engage it, despite disagreeing with his ideas. The Dutch press were not supportive of the documentary; however, Morse stated, \\"I think that‚Äôs an ignorant approach. You should try understand the people who disagree with. If you don't have an in-depth understanding of someone it makes it very challenging to understand their viewpoint, if you don't understand where those views came from.\\" Morse stated that throughout the whole production time span, the production team applied the lessons they learned at the Sa√Ød Business School. Morse thought that even though Wilders had such strong beliefs politically, he was a likeable person; at their first meeting for the documentary, Wilders and Morse made each other laugh often, despite Morse expecting Wilders to be \\"a monster.\\" The documentary follows Wilders' campaign and provides an up-close view of him, discussing what his ideas are politically, including clearing Islam from the Netherlands and shutting down all mosques, as well as providing information about himself, such as talking about his two cats and describing himself as a \\"spoilt child.\\" The documentary also discusses how Wilders constantly has strict security around him, and how it affects him. Morse describes the comparison between Wilders and Trump as ironic, due to how little they have in common. Morse thought that his work producing Amanda Knox allowed Wilders to trust him more; many journalists would have a much more difficult time getting up-close to Wilders. The film premiered at DOC NYC in November 2017 and on Hulu in the US in June 2018.

Life  Born in Amersfoort, Dieppo was a soloist at the Op√©ra-Comique and the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire. He was much appreciated by Berlioz who highlighted the trombone in his compositions for him. In 1833, Luigi Cherubini reopened the trombone class of the Conservatoire de Paris by entrusting it to F√©lix VobaronF√©lix Vobaron on BnF and being directed by Dieppo. A trombone class was created in 1794-1795 with the law of 16 Thermidor year 3 (3 August 1795). The musicians of the National Guard were then teachers. The class was then closed in 1802. A certain Pierre-Fran√ßois Marcillac was the last teacher. Dieppo was professor of trombone at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1836 to 1871. Dieppo lived in a period when the trombone was little recognized by composers. Despite the emergence of the symphony orchestra, composers made little use of it as a soloist: Beethoven gave it brief appearances, Mozart used it in his operas but never considered it a solo instrument (despite the solo of the Requiem). After the reopening of the class in 1833, each teacher had his or her own working method, corresponding to the evolution of the trombone in their time. The Dieppo method is one of the first reference methods, copies of which can still be consulted today. Dieppo died in Dijon at the age of 69.

He served as the pastor for the San Jos√© de Pinula parish since the late 1960s until his murder in mid-1978 due to his consistent championing of human rights and in particular his demand that all Guatemalans have the basic right to access clean water. His constant speaking out against corruption and regime abuses led to his enemies planning to kill him in an effort to subdue potential rebellion in the region. The beatification process for the late priest opened in 2007 under Pope Benedict XVI and he became titled as a Servant of God at the cause's onset. Life Herm√≥genes L√≥pez Coarchita was born in Guatemala on 16 September 1928 to √Ångel L√≥pez Hern√°ndez and Victoria Coarchita Santa Cruz. His siblings were: * Mar√≠a Clemencia * Alicia * Sarvelia * Froil√°n * Jacobo Israel * Juan Bautista * √Ångel Arturo He was baptized in the parish church in Ciudad Vieja on 20 September 1928 and his godmother was Eusebia Coarchita. In 1943 he began his studies for the priesthood in the capital and in 1951 departed for San Salvador for his theological studies; he returned to his native home in 1954. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 7 November 1954 in the archdiocesan cathedral from Archbishop Mariano Rossell Arellano. His first assignment following his ordination was to serve as a spiritual director in the capital before becoming a chaplain in the Nuestra Se√±ora de F√°tima church and later as an assistant pastor of La Florida both in the nation's capital. He was appointed as the parish priest for the San Jos√© de Pinula parish on 28 November 1966 and set himself on learning about the conditions of the people in order to know how better to provide for their spiritual and material needs and also sought to focus on the older members of his parish. He also became part of a group of writers working for the small newspaper outlet Vocero Quincenal. Coarchita dedicated his priesthood to care for the poorest in his parish which included those who were from indigenous populations. He defended the right for people to access clean and fresh water which became a common theme in his preaching. Coarchita also opposed the sterilization of women for birth control campaigns seeing them as going against the dignities and rights of women. Coarchita was murdered on 30 June 1978 around 11:00am in the San Luis town. Coarchita was near Los Cerritos in the San Luis town four kilometers from his parish along the road to Palencia in the morning driving his red pick-up truck when armed individuals waited for him and stopped his vehicle before shooting him several times in the chest. He had been returning from visiting two sick parishioners. He had been murdered due to his constant opposition to corruption fearing a popular revolt and so hoped killing him would subdue potential rebellion. His remains are now interred on the right side of his church and are clothed in a black cassock with a stole bearing spots of blood from when he was murdered. Beatification process The beatification process was launched under Pope Benedict XVI on 20 July 2007 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" decree (meaning no objections to the cause) and titled Coarchita as a Servant of God. The diocesan process was launched in the nation's archdiocese on 27 December 2007 and was later closed on 22 June 2013. The C.C.S. validated this process on 10 October 2014.

Troll spent a short time in Dachau concentration camp and served in the German Army during World War II. After the war he was sentenced to ten years in jail for his role as informer and released after five, in contrast to his Gestapo handlers who were not prosecuted. Troll was never a Nazi, opposing the regime instead, but a number of factors have been cited for his betrayal, among them financial difficulties, his treatment while being held at Dachau and the threat of physical violence against his stepbrothers should he not cooperate. Biography Early life Troll, the son of a truck driver, and born in Lower Bavaria, grew up in Munich. Troll worked as a labourer on building sites and as a life guard for the city of Munich, but lost his job in 1931 because of his left-wing activities and thereafter remained unemployed until 1934. Troll lived in the working class suburb of Giesing, in public housing, an area dominated by unemployment and communist activities, and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1932. Nazi era With Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, the Nazis took power in Bavaria on 9 March 1933 and Troll was arrested the same day alongside his two stepbrothers and taken to Dachau concentration camp. He and his brothers were some of its first inmates. Troll was released in May and worked as an informer for the Bavarian political police, now under the control of Heinrich Himmler. The possibility exists that he either already worked as an informer when he joined the KPD in 1932, or that he may have been forced into cooperating after his release by the threat that his brothers would be killed or ill treated at Dachau should he refuse. His difficult financial situation as well as the fact that he was broken by ill treatment while at Dachau may also have been factors. In any case, from May 1933 Troll made a concentrated effort to establish the names of Bavarian communists who had gone underground. Because of the decentralized nature of the communist movements it had become very hard for the police to track the communist resistance. Under the code name \\"Theo\\", Troll actively recruited members for the communist resistance. He was employed at a building site at the Deutsches Museum in Munich in 1934 and successfully recruited members there. Those as well as communists who distributed illegal leaflets and collected donations for the Rote Hilfe, an organisation supporting family members of people arrested by the Nazis, were betrayed by Troll. He rose to become, in April 1935, the leader of the Rote Hilfe and, in early 1936, the leader of the KPD in Southern Bavaria. Troll travelled repeatedly to Switzerland and Czechoslovakia to obtain donations and instructions while also infiltrating the non-communist resistance in Bavaria with his informers. Because of his work the Bavarian political police were able to wait until mid-1935 until initiating a wave of arrests, being in almost complete control of the communist resistance in Munich and able to direct it through Troll. By then, when suspicion started to fall on him, Troll had handed the names of 250 communists and sympathisers to the police as well as betrayed their organisational structure, bringing the communist resistance in Munich to an almost complete standstill. Some of the resistance members he betrayed were subsequently sentenced to death and executed. He was also involved in the destruction of the Munich cell of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany and made contact with Catholic and monarchist resistance groups as part of the aim of the KPD to create a united peoples front, the Volksfront, to resist Hitler and the Nazis. Troll was withdrawn as an informer by the Gestapo in 1936 and subsequently worked in the Messerschmitt aircraft factory in Regensburg, courtesy to a glowing referral provided by Karl Brunner, the head of the Gestapo in Munich. While paid well during his times as police informer for his work, receiving up to 240 Reichsmark per month, Troll did not receive any further benefits once his role had been completed and the Gestapo actively tried to ensure that he would not be employed in any politically sensitive role. From 1940 to 1944 Troll served in the Wehrmacht until captured in 1944, and returned to Germany in 1946 after having been a prisoner of war in France. During his time in the German military his comrades noted that Troll was opposed to the Nazi regime and criticised it, something they testified to in his trial after the war. Post-war He was tracked down by victims of his betrayal, who extracted a written confession from him, which led to his arrest in West Germany in May 1947. He was sentenced to ten years in a labour camp by a court in Regensburg, but released after five for health reasons. The sentence against Troll in Regensburg was one of the hardest for Nazi crimes there and also included confiscation of his assets, loss of the right to vote, and a ban from working. Attempts to prosecute him further for the death of communists he betrayed were unsuccessful as the court in Munich deemed the result of his actions as within the frame of the anti-communist laws in Germany at the time and the Cold War anti-communist attitude in the west after the war. His three former contacts in the Gestapo who he reported to were not prosecuted, although they did spend some compulsory time in detention for being members of the organisation. Some even re-entered Bavarian government service after the war. Troll died in Regensburg on 7 April 1972 without suffering any further repercussions for his actions as informer. The destruction of the communist resistance in Munich and the role Troll played in it became part of the novel Verrat in M√ºnchen und Burghausen (Betrayal in Munich and Burghausen) by Max Brym, published in 2018, which tells the story a fictional protagonist in the back ground of the real events.

The salt layer acts as insulation and helps cook the food in an even and gentle manner. After baking, the salt crust is cracked and discarded, revealing the moist and evenly cooked food.  Technique and foods  Salt-baked chicken with the salt crust removed, ready for serving Typically delicate foods such as fish, chicken/poultry or vegetables are cooked using this method. In each case the aim is to lock in moisture, protect the food from drying, ensure even cooking, and maximise the flavour. The salt crust can be created simply by adding a sufficient quantity of coarse or fine salt to cover the food item. Water may be sprayed on top, to help the salt form a hard crust. Alternatively, the salt may be mixed with egg white to form a pliable paste. Baking typically occurs in an oven at around , with the salt crust acting as a cooking vessel. This slows heat transfer to the food creating a slow and low dry oven, beneficial to most proteins. To serve, the crust is broken and carefully removed, to avoid leaving excess salt residues in the food. Steak can also be cooked using a similar method rather than broiling it and risk the loss of its juices. Coating a pan with salt and cooking the steak, ideally approximately an inch thick or less, on top yields a more moist and flavourful cut. The pan is heated until the salt crackles and steaks cooked with this method usually involves a crispy crust made of the salt. This is a key difference to other salt crusts as usually it is discarded but in this case it is used to add texture and flavour to the steak.  History  The earliest recipe found for salt-baked is from the fourth century BCE in Archestratus' Life of Luxury. The recipe details for a whole, round white fish such as sea bass, snapper or sea bream that was cleaned then gutted. The fish is seasoned with thyme being inserted into the cavity of the fish prior to the salt crust encapsulating it in two pounds of salt glued together with water and egg whites. In a Muslim cookbook originating from the thirteenth century, a layer of salt is placed on a new terracotta tile as a base and the fish is placed on top and another layer of salt is added on, then finally being placed in an oven. The first recorded reference in China resembling the technique of baking in a salt crust is salt-baked chicken from Dong Jing in the province of Guangdong during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The chicken was cooked and preserved in the salt fields of the area giving them added flavour. A more recent traditionally recipe is building a cocoon of salt around the chicken protecting it from direct heat ensuring even cooking and the possibility of drying out the meat. The chicken is wrapped in a tight parcel concentrating all the natural flavours of the chicken resulting in a succulent and tender product. This can be seen as the combination of the salt crust method with the French en papillote style.  Around the world  *The salt-crusted fish has appeared in many different countries such as France, Italy, Spain and China. *In southern Italy, fish native to the region such as bass, bream trout or snapper is traditionally baked in salt crust, using a combination of coarse salt for the base and fine salt for the top layer. *In Thailand, salt crusted fish is cooked, stuffed with lemongrass. *In Turkey, chicken baked in salt crust is a traditional dish from the province of Hatay, with records dating back to the Ottoman period. It is regarded that the technique may have been adopted from China. *In Colombia, beef tenderloin is baked in a salt crust, then wrapped in a kitchen towel and baked on a top of hot coals.  Nutritional research  A study by Sinop University in Turkey sought to identify the impact of a salt crust on cooking rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The fish was gutted, and its stomach cavity stuffed with flavourings, before wrapping in aluminium foil to prevent the absorption of salt into the flesh. A salt crust was made from rock salt, egg white and water. The was covered with the salt mixture and baked at for 45 minutes, then cooled down to room temperature before being uncovered. The results showed that moisture and carbohydrate levels decreased, while other nutritional values increased. The flavour was tested by trained professionals who concluded that the baking of the fish in a salt crust was satisfactory in terms of sensory characteristics. Some of the panelists added more salt to the dish. Hence it can be deduced that the dish can be readily eaten by people who suffer from various illnesses like hypertension.

He was convicted of killing four people out of his 5 confirmed murders, but could possibly have upwards of 6 victims.  Early life  Szab√≥ was born into a farmer's family in 1968, and had lived on a farm since his youth. He studied until the eight grade in elementary school, refusing to study any more. His father died early, and his brother who lived on the farm committed suicide. Szab√≥ has already had a criminal record at the time of the murders, as he was convicted for the rape of a 60-year-old woman. He also behaved violently with his partner, who broke the relationship with him because of this. He then began living alone on his farm as a farmer and doing occasional farm work. In addition to this, he also participated in organizing seasonal workers from Romania during the agricultural season, finding work and accommodation for them. During the second half of the 1990s, the traffic near Bal√°stya grew, as the civil war in Yugoslavia had recently ended and many passed through the 5th Highway along the settlement. The increasing turnover of the highway attracted businesses, criminals, merchants and prostitutes to the settlement, including some of Szab√≥'s future victims.  Confirmed murders  Szab√≥'s first proven murder was of a woman working in a bar, with whom he met on April 28, 1998. He managed to persuade her to stay on his farm on the outskirts of Bal√°stya. Upon their arrival, the woman was hit with a heavy object several times, dying from the severe head injuries. Szab√≥ then dismembered his victim and buried her body in a pit 50 meters away from the farm, in which he also placed her clothes. The second murder took place in a similar fashion. Szab√≥ met another woman whom he persuaded to come to his farm. When she came, he hit her with heavy object on the head and neck, with the woman dying from the heavy blows. The body was then dismembered and placed in the same pit as before, the only difference being that the second victim's head was never discovered. In February 2000, on the pretext of joint theft of fire syringes, Szab√≥ lured and killed Teresia K. The woman was strangled in an orchard, and was then mutilated and burned. Her clothes were never found either. The fourt proven murder led to Szab√≥'s downfall. In August 2001, he convinced a female dealer who used to sell cell phones that she would get a large amount of phones at a favorable price. The woman believed him, and on August 25 she collected 300,000 forints from the bank. The woman then drove to Szab√≥'s farm, where she was strangled by him not far from the place. The murderer then disposed of the evidence and the woman's small motorbike in a nearby water hole. However, the authorities were closely monitoring the disappearances, and when the phone dealer disappeared, they searched through her call lists, where they found Zolt√°n Szab√≥'s number. When questioned, he confessed to the murder. Later on, when more corpses were discovered, he confessed to these murders as well.  Unconfirmed murders  On August 25, 1998, Szab√≥ supposedly forced prostitute M√≥nika K. to leave the 5th Highway car park and go to his farm. There, he strangled her in a nearby orchard and dragged the body to a track near the Cegl√©d-Szeged railway line. Subsequently, a freight train and two other trains ran over the body, completely crushing it. Although Szab√≥ was last seen in her company, the court could not definitely prove that he was the culprit, and he was not convicted of M√≥nika K.'s murder. Szab√≥ also mentioned a sixth murder, which he claimed to have not committed but simply knew of. The investigators doubted his claim of innocence, but the post-mortum investigation proved ineffective, and so this case was included in the indictment. The police investigator who headed the investigation also stated that he was certain Szab√≥ was responsible for more murders. The detective, referring to a witness' testimony, wrote that Szab√≥ was responsible for the disappearances of a Romanian family of five. He was so confident of his opinion that he offered 500,000 forints to Szab√≥ for each new corpse he showed the location to.  Investigation, trial and prison  After Szab√≥'s capture, extensive research began for the killer's victims. Following his testimony, the surrounding area was searched, and in the specified places, excavations of an unprecedentead scale, almost of landscaping, began. During the search, four corpses from Szab√≥'s testimonies were located, but no remnants of other murders were found. Despite this, the prosecution suspected him of murdering five women. The Csongr√°d County court, hearing the case at first instance, found Zolt√°n Szab√≥ guilty of all four murders and sentenced him to life imprisonment in November 2003. On September 10, 2004, the Szeged Court Judge sentenced to life imprisonment for a final time. The Trial Chamber could not find any evidence that Szab√≥'s murders involved sexual aberration, and there was no mention of this other despicable reason in the judgment. The farm where Szab√≥'s offenses were committed still stands as of 2015. The offender was detained in the secluded area of the Star Prison in Szeged. On December 5, 2016, the suicidal Szab√≥ and his cellmate hanged themselves.  References   External links  * Zolt√°n B√°tyi: Listen to the victims of Bal√°stya.

Typically bedroom producers use accessible digital technology that costs less than the equipment in a professional studio, such as MIDI controller-based instruments and virtual studio technology (software synthesized instruments and digital effects), to create music for release to the world. While a professional record producer oversees and guides the recording process, often working alongside multiple people such as studio musicians, singers, engineers, mixers, songwriters, arrangers, and orchestrators, a bedroom producer does everything independently: creating the ideas, recording them and processing them for release. Bedroom producers are often self-taught, learning sound design, mixing and music theory by reading music production blogs and watching tutorials on the internet. As bedroom producers depend on the accessibility of music technology, bedroom production has been made easier with advances in home computing power and digital audio workstations (DAW).  Characteristics  A small home studio with a Korg MicroX synthesizer, a Korg Electribe R (ER-1), Denon DN-2500F & Remote Control Unit RC-44, and a Behringer VMX-100 A majority of bedroom producers employ the MIDI sequencing capabilities of digital audio workstations, in conjunction with recorded sounds, to create musical compositions. These DAWs may be set up alongside high-quality recording equipment such as microphones and USB interfaces which enable bedroom producers to emulate full recording studio environments in a home studio. These home studios can be created for professional and hobbyist use. Despite economic advantages of the home studio, sometimes the more accessible technology that is used may hinder the collaborative creative processes because this recording technology may not be as effective as in traditional recording studios. While in the 1990s and the 2000s, music that was popular on the radio tended to be highly guitar-centric, over the last decade bedroom producers have had the ability to create deceptively sophisticated musical productions (with digital string orchestra, for example) which have become prominent on the radio, impacting mainstream culture. While rock musicians would have to perform live to make a name for themselves, bedroom producers often prefer the more intimate solitude of their own homes and using the internet allows them to not only release their music but also have maximum control over their own image as independent artists. This has also lead to a rise in independent producing entrepreneurs for the first time since the 1950s/1960s. The heightened accessibility of production software such as Ableton and equipment has led to a \\"rapid democratisation of the tools in terms of creating music.\\" Today, many young musicians are leaning towards to getting into music through software instead of through instruments because the startup cost is so low, especially with the piracy of software onto personal laptops. This has created the trend of engineering producers, or at least producers who have basic audio engineering knowledge. Because bedroom produced music is made independently or in small collaborations, it is often strongly connoted with being DIY. Bedroom produced music is also often referred to as being made \\"in the box,\\" which is when all or part of the music production is completed with software processing of samples, VSTs and synths within a DAW. Bedroom produced music relies largely on sharing music through social media. Recorded music, especially bedroom produced and independent music is regarded as an internet industry.  History  A 1980s home studio with a reel-to-reel tape recorder Although there was some early bedroom production before the 1990s using hardware instruments and recording to tape, the rise of bedroom production is more often closely related to an increase in computing power and decrease in cost of music technologies which allowed for DAWs to become more accessible towards the end of the 20th century. In the early 1990s Steinberg released its DAW; Cubase Audio and in 1996 Steinberg invented the VST and remodeled the Cubase interface to emulate a full hardware recording environment. DAWs today are inexpensive, and most bedroom producers use them to create their music. Even before the invention of DAWs people recorded in home studios on tape. A home studio is simply a music setup in a person's home that has most of the recording capabilities of a traditional recording studio. The invention of MIDI \\"allowed the first home studios to be born.\\" Despite the term \\"bedroom producers\\", they may have their studio in other rooms, such as a basement. Indeed it may not be necessary to have a home studio at all, since all that is needed is a laptop with a DAW. Before the invention of DAWs, MIDI could only be utilised through external hardware setups which was very expensive. Since the monetary cost of recording software and technology has decreased and laptops with DAW software have become more available, there has been a very large increase in the number of producers creating music using DAWs as an all in one solution. Because of this large increase in the number of music producers some people believe the overall quality of electronic music has increased, while others say that with the saturation of electronic producers releasing in the music market, it has become significantly harder for producers to become recognised. During the lineage of bedroom production, the style has crossed many genres of music. Although most closely with forms of electronic music ranging from earlier forms such as techno, and dubstep and electronica, bedroom producers include pop musicians and hip hop musicians. In the 2000s and 2010s, House, Cloud Rap, Chillwave, Bedroom Pop and Downtempo have been popular genres of music created by bedroom producers.  Software  This section will describe the common use of DAWs and VST software for creating bedroom-produced music. First, MIDI will be explained to clarify its use in DAW. MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and is the most common way of connecting musical equipment to various devices and to a central DAW. Because MIDI information is non-acoustic, in the form of data instead of sound waves, it can be used to send musical information from one VST device to another or through external hardware which can be connected to a DAW, such as a MIDI keyboard or other MIDI controller. For example, if a melody is performed on a MIDI keyboard, this melody could be plugged into a synth module so that it might sound like any instrument, from a flute or electric guitar, or even a sampled full orchestra. When MIDI information is sent to different VST devices, new sounds are created from the same musical data. For example, a melody played by a virtual MIDI (VST) piano could be moved into a guitar track in a DAW to have exactly the same passage played by a virtual guitar. Because MIDI is a form of data, it is typically viewed in the form of a piano roll, not as waveforms. MIDI was created in the early 80's by multiple large instrument manufacturers working together to standardise the communication between the devices of different instrument manufacturers. A DAW is a Digital Audio Workstation. This is an electronic device or more commonly a musical software used for recording, mixing, editing and processing digital audio. While the structure of a DAW can vary greatly from being a single software to a series of connected hardware, all DAWs have a central interface for processing audio into a final composition on a laptop or computer. Virtual Studio Technologies or VSTs are devices used to replicate analog effects, instruments and effects that used to be commonly found in studios, for audio processing and synthesis within DAW software. VST instruments and VST effects are most commonly used; however, other types of VSTs also exist, such as various spectrum analysers. Some VSTs also emulate traditional synthesisers and samplers. VST instruments synthesise sound by taking a MIDI input and then sending it to an output or through VST effects via effects chaining. Common types of VST: VST Effects, which manipulate the audio signal of a track or group of tracks. Examples include EQ, compression, delay. VST Instruments, which generate their own audio signal like a musical instrument. These can be highly manipulated to create synthesised sounds or they may be samples that imitate the sound of real acoustic instruments. VST MIDI effects: Manipulates the MIDI information, such as arpeggiation of the notes in a sustained chord. Bedroom producers may use VSTs such as Massive, Serum, Spire, or Nexus. Flume has said that electronic production techniques have provided expanded creative possibilities. Bedroom producers may \\"pirate\\" their music software using torrenting or \\"cracking\\", which leads to an even higher level of access to DAWs and VSTs for bedroom producers. In some cases the pirating of music software in this way has led to increased sales for these larger companies. However, pirating software can cause problems for less established VST companies.  Equipment  MIDI keyboards, a laptop, a record player, a reel- to-reel tape machine, and electronic devices can be seen in this home studio. While setups between individuals may vary, the basic setup of a bedroom home studio includes: a computer connected to a DAW, a microphone with a pop filter running through an audio interface, headphones and/or monitors and a MIDI controller such as a MIDI keyboard or drum machine. The microphone will record the vocals, sounds and acoustic instruments that may be used by sending the audio into the DAW through the audio interface. The sound of the music in the DAW is played back through the audio interface in playback. The pop filter is used to reduce the loud signal of word plosions such as when pronouncing words starting with 'p' or 'b' sounds. Headphones and monitors are used to listen to the playback and for mixing. A MIDI controller works as the instrument for producers, to use instead of programming individual notes into sequences in the DAW. While it is common to record in a bedroom studio, Sampling is also widely used in bedroom production. Bedroom producers typically uses drum samples as a cheaper alternative to recording drums, however a huge range of different kinds of samples are used in bedroom productions. Such as: chord loops, vocal samples, kit dimples and sometimes even entire sections of songs (although this often infringes copyright).  Market saturation  Due to massive increase in producers releasing music from home studios, the market of electronic music, especially EDM has become over-saturated. One producer, Deadmau5, claims that this is because the sounds of popular electronic dance music are easily reproducible so many artists who are seeking mainstream success are making very stylistically similar sounding music. This is especially true for EDM mixing techniques and the trend of mixing for loud volumes instead of mixing for dynamics. From an economic perspective Forbes believes the EDM industry (now $7.4billion US) still has growth potential and that this growth is not only coming from live performances such as from festivals but also from streaming and downloading, which contributes largely to the total revenues of EDM. For the broader electronic music genre, many believe that its largely instrumental nature makes it highly transferable to markets which speak different languages. So, even if a point of saturation is reached in some countries, market growth of the genre will likely continue in others.

Biography  After spending his childhood in Cagliari and acquiring the gymnasium license, at the outbreak of World War II Pintor left Sardinia to reach Rome with his mother and two sisters, where, shortly after, he learned of his father's death. He joined the Italian resistance movement in 1943 as a member of the Patriotic Action Groups, after learning that his brother Giaime was killed after stepped on a mine. On 14 May 1944, Pintor was arrested by the fascists, tortured and imprisoned at Regina Coeli, waiting for a death sentence; luckily, Pintor was freed one month later during the Liberation of Rome. After the end of the war, Pintor began his journalistic career at L'Unit√†, becoming co-editor-in-chief of the Roman edition. He left L'Unit√† in 1965. A member of the Italian Communist Party, Pintor was very close to the left-wing of the party, lead by Pietro Ingrao, and opposed Giorgio Amendola's project of unifying the PCI with other left- wing of centre-left parties. After the 1968 election, Pintor is elected to the Chamber of Deputies with the Italian Communist Party, which he left after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union. In 1969, Pintor is one of the founders, together with Lucio Magri, Rossana Rossanda and Luciana Castellina, of the left-wing newspaper Il manifesto: Pintor is later appointed editor-in-chief from 1971 to 1975, from 1976 to 1978 and from 1991 to 1995. In the 1980s, after having been a member of the Proletarian Unity Party for Communism, Pintor was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the 1987 election as an independent in the list of the PCI, and joined the parliamentary group of the Independent Left. After the end of his political career, Pintor has continued to write on Il manifesto until his death on 17 May 2003, at the age of 77.

She was briefly requisitioned by the Admiralty, to serve as a Boom Defence Tender during World War II (between 1939 and 1945), but returned to Ministry service in 1946. In 1960 the RV Onaway was replaced by the RV Tellina. Construction In 1928 large crowds witnessed the launch of the motor fishing bauldie Onaway from the boatbuilding yard of Walter Reekie, Anstruther, Scotland. She was built to the order of Mr William, W Carstairs of Cellardyke and was a sister ship of the Winaway, a 53ft long steam drifter. Onaway was fitted with a 48 hp semi-diesel engine and special design of steam boiler and capstan.

The RV Onaway (LT358) was in service with MAFF from December 1930 until March 1960, during which time she participated in 209 separate research campaigns. During the 1930s she was largely confined to inshore coastal waters of the southern North Sea including East Anglia, the Thames estuary, southern bight and Straits of Dover. Most of her early efforts were dedicated to the surveying of herring and sprat, but also plankton sampling and characterizing hydrology.Goodwin, N.B., Dare, P.J., Belson, S.J., Gunstone, K.L., Ellis, J.R., Rogers, S.I.

In the 1950s she was used as a platform for large-scale tagging programmes targeting North Sea sole, crab, rays, herring and whiting. Between 1952 and 1959 she conducted annual surveys to characterize scallop populations in the English Channel. In March 1959 the RV Onaway was used to carry out surveys of colliery waste dumping sites off the northeast coast of England.Goodwin, N.B., Dare, P.J., Belson, S.J., Gunstone, K.L., Ellis, J.R., Rogers, S.I.

Originally agreed to last for nine months, it was repeatedly renewed until 1355. Background On 3 August 1347 the French town of Calais, which had been besieged by an English army for eleven months, capitulated. The commander of the English army, King Edward III (), immediately paid off a large part of his army and released his Flemish allies. The French commander, Philip VI of France (), in turn stood town the French army. Edward promptly launched strong raids up to into French territory. Philip attempted to recall his army, setting a date of 1 September, but experienced serious difficulties. His treasury was exhausted and taxes for the war had to be collected in many places at sword point. Despite these exigencies, ready cash was not forthcoming. In addition, the French army had little stomach for further conflict, and Philip was reduced to threatening to confiscate the estates of nobles who refused to muster. He set back the date for his army to assemble by a month. Edward also had difficulties in raising money, partly due to the unexpected timing of the need; he employed draconian measures, which were extremely unpopular. The English also suffered a pair of military setbacks: a large raid was routed by the French garrison of Saint-Omer; and a supply convoy en route to Calais was captured by French raiders from Boulogne. Truce alt=A Medieval image of Puilip IV seated, wearing a blue robe decorated with fleurs de lys Two cardinals acting as papal emissaries from Pope Clement VI had been attempting to negotiate a halt to hostilities since July 1346, with no success. Given the military misfortunes and financial exhaustion of both sides, they found willing listeners in September and by the 28th a truce had been agreed. The treaty strongly favoured the English, and confirmed them in possession of all of their territorial conquests in France and Scotland; the Flemish were confirmed in their de facto independence; and Philip was prevented from punishing those French nobles who had conspired, or even fought, against him. The Truce of Calais was to run for nine months to 7 July 1348. In November 1348 the truce was extended for a further twelve months and again in May 1349. It was subsequently repeatedly extended until it was formally set aside in 1355. The truce did not stop the on-going naval clashes between the two countries nor the fighting in Gascony and Brittany. After full-scale war resumed in 1355 it continued until 1360, when it ended with the Treaty of Br√©tigny.

MacKinnon worked as a probationer nurse in Braehead Cottage Hospital, Dumbarton from 1901.  Career   Army career in France  In 1914, MacKinnon joined the French Flag Nursing Corps and soon after travelled to France as the World War I intensified. She and the other 'British Nurses in France' were on the Front Line. In 1918 MacKinnon was awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery during the Third Battle of the Aisne. This was recorded by The Times newspaper and The British Journal of Nursing: > \\"Following is the citation of the French army conferring the Croix de Guerre > on Miss Annie Mackinnon, a British nurse attached to the French Flag Nursing > corps. A nurse who under the difficult circumstances of the withdrawal of > the ambulance under enemy fire continued to attend the sick and wounded up > to the last minute with remarkable courage and thus demonstrating the three > years that she has devoted herself to the French soldiers.\\" Following the war MacKinnon remained in France working in Marseille and Paris for the Rockefeller Foundation which was part of the relief effort sending food supplies to the European continent.

In 1887, she became a missionary and doctor in India, where she founded what would become a large hospital in Madras. During the First World War, she also worked for the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service as a doctor in Serbia and France.  Early life and education Alexandrina McPhail was born in Knock, Sleat, on the Isle of Skye in June 1860. She was the daughter of Reverend John Sinclair MacPhail, first Free Church minister of Sleat, and later, minister of the United Free Church; and Jessie Reid (n√©e Finlayson). MacPhail attended the London School of Medicine for Women and graduated in 1887.  Career  Rainy Hospital in its prime After graduation, she travelled to Madras in India. MacPhail was the first woman physician sent by the Free Church of Scotland as a medical missionary. At the time she was sent to take the post, there were only 60 women registered as physicians in England and only ten were serving abroad. MacPhail founded a permanent dispensary and clinic in her home in Madras during 1888, primarily focussing on health care for women and children. Christina Rainy, a Scottish educationist (and sister of Robert Rainy), arrived in Madras towards the end of the 19th century, and began raising funds to support the clinic back in Scotland. These additional funds allowed for the clinic to be expanded and a fully fledged mission, Rainy Hospital, was opened in 1914 by Lord Pentland. During The Great War, MacPhail travelled to Serbia as a doctor and worked for the French under the auspices of the SWH at a sanatorium in Haute Savoie. MacPhail returned to the hospital in Madras and was still working there in 1928. The hospital was nearly entirely funded by contributions by some private patients and some charitable grants.  Death  MacPhail died in Edinburgh on 6 November 1946.  Awards and honours  In 1912 MacPhail received a silver Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for public services in India from the Indian Viceroy. She was granted an additional service bar to the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in 1918. She was awarded an OBE in the King George V Birthday honours list 1930.

Etymology The name Cheptalel in Kalenjin mythology was the second most common name given to the supreme being, it denotes an attribute that gives the meaning 'controller of all things'. The similar sounding name Cheptalil gives the thought of a supreme being endowed with glory (lilindo). The two names, Cheptalel and Cheptalil, though false cognates are used interchangeably in common parlance. Cheptalel is commonly seen to derive from the feminine prefix Chep (or fully Chepto meaning girl) and the word 'lel' meaning white. A similar naming convention is found in the name Koitalel, where koita means stone. However, when used to denote the supreme being the prefix does not denote a female supreme being. Rather it is associated with one aspect, that of creation and prosperity of life as opposed to the masculine which was associated with destruction.Naaman, R., Investigation Of Kipsigis Worldview Items Towards Understanding The Catholic Doctrine Of Salvation Through Inculturation Approach: A Case Of Kericho Sub-county, p.55 online It has also been postulated that the name derives from a Sudanic name for the sun 'Tel', as of Chee-po-Tel or Tie-po-Tel, thus the girl of Tel i.e. She of the Sun.Did the God Ra Derive from Arabia? An examination of Wesley Muhammad's claim in Black Arabia and the African Origins of Islam, Major points of disagreement online Life There is little in the legend about Cheptalel's background though certain aspects of her early life appear in all traditions. Notably, she is understood to have been a virgin and in some accounts the only child in her family. In all accounts she had a boyfriend who plays a significant role in saving her life. Drought legend In the legend, there came a time when rain disappeared for many years leading to a severe drought such that the elders held a meeting to decide on what to do. It was decided that a young girl would be offered as, or would go and offer, a sacrifice to the owner of the sky so that he would allow rain to fall. A young virgin girl was thus selected to go to a body of water (usually the home of Ilat) to pray for rain. Her boyfriend found out about the plan and determined to follow her surreptitiously as she went on her mission. When she arrived at the lake (in some accounts waterfall), she stood at the shore and sang thus; \\"Tulog tuloei, tulo tuloei, I was sent by the age-mates Of my father and my mother To go to the shore of a lake So that it can rain\\" As she sang, it began to drizzle and when she sang again it began to pour. When she sang a third time, it began to rain heavily and at the same time Ilat, in the form of lightning, struck but before he could get the girl, her boyfriend jumped out of his hiding place and killed Ilat thus rescuing Cheptalel. In one version of the legend, a pure white goat was taken along with her to the water and there the goat was sacrificed and the girl spared. In popular culture Christian missionaries adopted the name as a name for God. The name remains in common use today.Ochieng, P., Whatever you do, don‚Äôt kill the Kenyan dream, Nation Newspaper, 2010 online References Category:Kalenjin folklore ","title":"Cheptalel"},{"id":"58832023","text":"Shivappa High School is a school located in the Indian city of Hyderabad.

It was Andr√© Tourret who advised a young 19-year-old violinist, Alfred Loewenguth, to team up with pianist Doreau. The two artists collaborated with the same enthusiasm for more than fifty years! This long work together was an essential factor in achieving a communion of spirit and a technical achievement that could guarantee the balance of expression of the two instruments. The duet successfully gave numerous concerts in France and abroad (Germany, England, etc.).

Sabarimala Temple is a temple of Shasta situated at Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta District, Kerala, India. Women In the reproductive age were not permitted to worship here, this ban being said to be out of respect to the celibate nature of the deity (underage teenage Male) in this temple. A Kerala high-court judgement had legalized this interpretation, and forbade women from entering the temple since 1991.Kerala High Court (5 April 1991) Bench: K Paripoornan, K B Marar; Source: (accessed Sunday 1 May 2016) In September 2018, a judgement of the Supreme Court of India ruled that all Hindu pilgrims regardless of gender can enter. The Constitution bench of the Supreme Court held that any exception placed on women because of biological differences violates the Constitution - that the ban violates the right to equality under Article 14, and freedom of religion under Article 25. This verdict led to protests by millions of Ayappa devotees who oppose the verdict. About 10 women, mostly leftist activists from Kerala, attempted to enter Sabarimala despite threats of physical assault against them but failed to reach the sanctum sanctorum. Defying such protests, two women activists belonging to the previously barred age group finally entered the temple through the rear gate, hiding their identity with camouflaging attires, on the early hours of 2 January 2019, with the help of State Police. When this alleged action was brought to the notice of the temple priests and authorities, the temple was closed for purification. Legend Ayyappan is typically a celibate god. In some locations he is same as Aiyyanar shown above with wives Poorna and Pushkala. Many legends exist about the god Ayyappa and how the temple came into being. According to one of them, Ayyappan, the deity of Sabarimala Temple is a celibate. When he defeated the evil demoness Mahushasuri, she turned into a beautiful young woman. She had actually been cursed to live the life of a demoness until the child born out of the union of Shiva and Vishnu defeated her in a battle. Ayyappan, being the abandoned son of Shiva and Mohini (an incarnation of Vishnu), could set her free after defeating her in the battle. After the battle, the young woman proposed to Ayyappan for marriage, but he refused her saying that he had been ordained to go to the forest, live the life of a brahmachari and answer the prayers of devotees. However, the young woman was persistent, so Ayyappan promised to marry her the day kanni-swamis (new devotees) would stop visiting him at Sabarimala. Unfortunately for the woman, Sabarimala was visited by kanni- swamis every year, and she was not able to marry Ayyappan. The woman is worshiped as goddess Malikappurathamma at a neighbouring temple. History According to the \\"Memoir of the Survey of the Travancore and Cochin States\\", published in two volumes by the Madras government in the 19th century, women of menstruating age were denied entry into the Sabarimala temple even two centuries ago. Though Benjamin Swain Ward and Peter Eyre Conner, lieutenants of the Madras Infantry, completed the survey by the end of the year 1820 after nearly five years of research, it was published in two volumes in 1893 and 1901. \\"Old women and young girls may approach the temple, but those who have attained the age of puberty and to a certain time of life are forbidden to approach as all sexual intercourse in that vicinity is averse to this deity (Lord Ayyappa),\\" the report said https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2018/11/22/british-era-survey-report-says- sabarimala-ban-existed-200-years-ago.html Prior to 1991 when the Kerala High Court forbade the entry of women to Sabarimala, several women had visited the temple sporadically, although mostly for non-religious reasons. There are records of women pilgrims visiting the temple to conduct the first rice- feeding ceremony of their children (Chorounu) at the temple premises. On 13 May 1940, even the Maharani of Tranvancore is recorded to have visited the temple. In 1986, when young actresses Jayashree, Sudha Chandran, Anu, Vadivukkarasi and Manorama danced near the deity at the pathinettam padi (18 steps) for the Tamil movie named Nambinar Keduvathillai, a fine of Rs. 1000 each was imposed on the actresses and the director of the movie. The Devaswom Board, the board in charge of the maintenance of the temple and premises was also fined Rs. 7500, because it had given the director permission to film at Sabarimala. Former Karnataka minister Jayamala has also claimed to have entered Sabarimala at the age of 27 and touched the idol in 1986. In 1990, the rice feeding ceremony of the granddaughter of the former Devaswom commissioner was held at Sabarimala in the presence of women relatives. Following a court case in connection with this event, the high court of Kerala prohibited the entry of women between 10 and 50 years of age to Sabarimala. In 1995, the then district collector Valsala Kumari(42) visited Sabarimala shrine (but didn't visit sanctum) under special permission to get firsthand information about the conditions at the temple in connection with her official duties and becoming the first woman to do so legitimately. In the same year, the local press reported the story of two young women, possibly wives of VIPs, who entered the shrine despite police vigilance. In January 2018, temple authorities made it mandatory for female devotees to furnish proof of their age when visiting Sabarimala. Kerala High Court Verdict In 1990, S Mahendran started a petition, alleging that young women were visiting Sabarimala. The verdict on the petition came in 1991 where Justices K. Paripoornan and K. Balanarayana Marar of the Kerala High Court banned entry of women between ages 10 and 50 from offering worship at Sabarimala, stating that such restriction was in accordance with the usage prevalent for a long time. In addition, the High court directed the Government of Kerala to use the police force to enforce the order to ban entry of women to the temple. The court observed thus: Supreme Court Verdict '''''' In 2006, six women, members of the Indian Young Lawyers' Association, petitioned the Supreme Court of India to lift the ban against women between the ages of 10 and 50 entering the Sabarimala temple. They argued that the practice was a violation of their constitutional rights and questioned the validity of provisions in the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules act of 1965 which supported it. In September 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that women of all age groups can enter Sabarimala temple. The court ruled thus: The verdict was passed with a 4-1 majority where Chief Justice Dipak Misra, and Justices A. M. Khanwilkar, R. F. Nariman and D. Y. Chandrachud favoured permitting women to enter the temple, while Justice Indu Malhotra dissented. Indu Malhotra said that every individual should be allowed to practice their faith irrespective of whether the practice is rational or logical. The Supreme Court observed that the custom of barring women was in violation of Article 25 (Clause 1) and Rule 3(b) of Kerala Hindu Places of Worship. The petition that led to this verdict was filed by the Indian Young Lawyers Association. On 14 November 2019, The Supreme Court Constitution Bench referred the review petitions as well as the writ petitions to a larger bench of not less than seven judges, may be constituted by the Honorable Chief Justice of India. The larger bench may also consider similar cases like entry of Muslim women in a Durgah/Mosque, of Parsi women married to a non-Parsi into the holy fire place of an Agyar and practice of female genital mutilation in Dawoodi Bohra community. The decision is favored by the Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Ajay Manikrao Khanwilkar and Indu Malhotra. Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud dissented. Arguments against women entry Some believe that such religious restriction is not odd as they are as per traditions to respect the deity of the temple; similar to this there are restrictions against men too in several prominent temples, for example Bramha temple, Pushkar. Sai Deepak, the lawyer representing two women's groups and a devotee sangam in the Supreme Court case has argued that the deity Ayyappan should be considered as a person, and should be given the Constitutional right to privacy under Article 21, thus restricting women of menstruating age from visiting him per his will. Prominent Jain Acharya Yugbhushan Suri Maharaj, also known as Pandit Maharaj, has said that sanctity was a religious issue and that it was connected to fundamental religious rights. Commenting on the Sabarimala temple row, Pandit Maharaj told IndiaToday.in, \\"Whether it is Sabarimala or Jharkhand's Shikharji, the agitations are for sanctity,\\" adding, \\"Religion talks about inner belief and sanctity. This should be respected. I am not against the judiciary or the Supreme Court, but they should not overlook the belief of the people.\\" Also, Art of Living founder Ravi Shankar batted for the rules that have been traditionally followed at the sanctum sanctorum of the Ayyappa Temple in Sabarimala. Some women choose to not enter the temple believing that it would be an insult to Malikappurathamma's love and sacrifice. Others believe that Ayyappan himself placed restrictions on women entering the temple because he wanted to be celibate, and the presence of women of reproductive age group would distract him from this cause. Others simply cite the at least 500-year-old tradition should be continued to be practised. Another point that was raised against the women was the fact that there are multiple temples dedicated to the Hindu deity Ayyappa (). Out of the many templed dedicated to Ayyappa, only one temple restricts the entry of the women in reproductive age. Some believe in the sexist taboo that menstruation is impure (thereby making women of menstruating age also impure), and that it is a sin to visit a Hindu god while they are impure. Another argument founded on sexism is that Sabarimala temple is situated on the top of a hill surrounded by mountains and dense forests, which some regard as physically challenging to women to navigate. An official of Sabarimala has pointed out that there will be lack of adequate sanitation facilities for women, thus making their journey difficult. Hospital facilities are also sparse. Some arguments centre on the male-as-norm perspective that relegates the lived experience of women to that of the \\"other\\". These include arguments that female pilgrims will 'distract' the male pilgrims who follow a 41-day period of strict abstinence from sex, and a statement by the Travancore Dewaswom Board president that allowing women to the temple will lead to 'immoral activities' and turn the place into 'a spot for sex tourism like Thailand'. A US-based cardiologist pointed out that menstruating women are barred from visiting temples because it can lead to endometriosis, but her arguments were later dismissed as being pseudoscientific. Arguments in favour of women entry Those in favour of allowing women entry to Sabarimala temple argue that menstruation is not impure, and that women have equal right to enter the temple. Some pointed out that women are allowed to enter other temples of Ayyappan, so that the exception for Sabarimala is unusual and inconsistent. A frequent criticism is that claims that women are impure, based on the physiological process of menstruation, is gender discrimination. According to the leftist historian, Rajan Gurukkal, there is \\"neither ritual sanctity nor scientific justification\\" for the argument of menstrual pollution. He opines that the shrine was originally a \\"cult spot\\" for a tribal deity, Ayyanar of local forest dwellers before it became a place of worship for Ayyappa in the 15th century. Unlike traditional Hindu beliefs that menstruation is impure, the tribals considered it to be auspicious and a symbol of fertility. They thronged to the temple along with their women and children of all ages until the 1960s. Gurukkal also argues that there is documented evidence of young savarna women making their way into the temple till the 1980s. The chief minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, said that his party (LDF) has always stood for gender equality and therefore will provide facilities and protection for women pilgrims to Sabarimala. Failed attempts Though many menstruation-age woman had entered the Sabarimala temple and it had been purified using tantric rituals in such violations before the supreme court verdict such as the famous Jayamala incident, no woman between the age of 10 to 50 were able to go inside the sabarimala temple post the Supreme court verdict. In October, when Sabarimala was opened for pilgrims for the first time since the Supreme Court verdict, protests were staged at the Nilakkal and Pamba base camps. Many women journalists were assaulted by the protesters and police had to resort to a lathi charge to disperse them. The protesters forced a 40-year-old woman from Andhra Pradesh to stop her journey to Sabarimala at Pamba. Suhasini Raj, a journalist working for New York Times was also forced to return after she was blocked by protesters near Marakkoottam. Two women of menstruating age attempted to enter the temple on 19 October 2018 but were blocked by protesters about 100 metres away from the sanctum sanctorum. They returned after the priest warned that he would close the sanctum sanctorum if they were to attempt to climb the 18 sacred steps leading to the deity. Women of menstruating age, including those who are not Hindus are trying to enter the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala in Kerala to hurt the sentiments of Ayyappa devotees. One of the women named Rehana Fathima was later arrested on grounds of 'hurting religious sentiments' for posting a photo in Facebook, in which she was seen sitting in an allegedly 'obscene pose' after dressing up as a devotee of Ayyappa. She was in jail for 18 days and is now out on bail. A 46-year-old woman who claimed that \\"her body was full of divine power from Ayyappa motivating her to climb Sabarimala\\" was asked to return after the police denied her protection. On 20 October 2018, one woman journalist and the president of Kerala Dalit Mahila Federation also had to return without reaching the deity due to protests. A female Dalit activist was attacked at various places by mobs on her way to Sabarimala even though she was accompanied by police and decided to return after reaching Pamba. She lost her job, was forced to leave her home and is now living in an undisclosed location under police protection fearing threats for her life from those who are against allowing women entry to Sabarimala. Trupti Desai, women's rights activist and founder of Bhumata Brigade, was blocked by protesters at Cochin International Airport on 16 November 2018, while on her journey to Sabarimala. She decided to return after getting stranded inside the airport for more than 14 hours and vowed to come back again. Four transwomen who attempted to visit Sabarimala temple were sent back by Erumely police on 16 December 2018. They alleged that the police harassed them and asked them to dress up like men if they wanted to visit the shrine. Even though they agreed to the demands of the police, they were eventually sent back citing the law and order situation at Sabarimala. They prayed at the shrine 2 days later as the temple authorities didn't object to allowing entry of transwomen at Sabarimala. A group of 11 women belonging to the Chennai based women right's outfit 'Manithi' were chased away by protesters after they covered a distance of 100 m uphill from the Pamba base camp, accompanied by Police on 23 December 2018. Even though the police claimed that the group later returned from Sabarimala on their own decision without visiting the shrine, the group alleged that they were forcefully made to return by Kerala Police. On 2 January 2019, two women claimed that they have entered Sabarimala shrine which was later confirmed using CCTV visuals. Temple was closed for purification. Protests and hartals BJP Hartal Protesting against Sabarimala Women Entry A total of seven hartals were organised in Kerala by various Hindu groups and their umbrella outfit Sabarimala Karma Samithi against allowing women to enter Sabarimala Temple since October 2018. The first hartal was observed in Pathanamthitta district on 7 October 2018. BJP called for this hartal in response to police beating up adv. Prakash Babu, state president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha during a protest march held on 6 October 2018. The second hartal was on 18 October 2018. The Bharatiya Janata Party called for this hartal across the state to deter women between the age of 10 and 50 years from worshipping at Sabarimala. The Indian National Congress also launched a protest demanding the state government to file a review petition against the Supreme Court's verdict. Rahul Easwar, a member of the family of Sabarimala priests and leader of Ayyappa Dharma Sena, was arrested for inciting violence and rioting near the Sabarimala temple complex. He was denied bail on the grounds that he could return to Sabarimala to incite further trouble. Malayalam actor Kollam Thulasi said that women who enter Sabarimala temple should be ripped in half. An FIR was registered against him for his deliberate act intended to outrage dignity of women and inciting violence. Over 3000 people were arrested and around 500 cases were registered at various police stations across Kerala in relation with the protests including hartal-related violence, since the Supreme court verdict came. The third hartal was on 2 November 2018. Sivadasan, a lottery seller went to Sabarimala pilgrimage and his dead body was found near Laha. BJP called for a hartal in Pathanamthitta district blaming police action at Pamba as the reason behind his death even though police confirmed that he died in a road traffic accident. Anticipating protests, IPC Section 144 was declared at Sannidhanam, Pamba, Nilakkal and Elavunkal when the temple reopened for the 41 day long Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrim season in 16 November 2018. Around 70 people were arrested for defying prohibitory orders and protesting near the main temple, also K. Surendran, state secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party and K.P.Sasikala, leader of Hindu Aikya Vedi were taken into preventive detention while on their journey to the temple on 17 November 2018. The human rights commission of Kerala has called it, \\"gross violation of human rights of Sabarimala devotees\\". The fourth hartal in Kerala was called by Bharatiya Janata Party on 17 November 2018. The reason for this hartal was the arrest of K P Sasikala. It was a statewide hartal. On 21 November, Thiruvananthapuram City Police Commissioner, P Prakash threatened NRIs who are using social media to express their displeasure of the state interfering in temple practices by \\"provocative voice notes videos and photos, and social media posts\\" of \\"getting their passports cancelled, and forcing to return to India.\\" Kerala Police was severely criticised by High Court for the various restrictions it had implemented in Sabarimala which caused difficulty for the pilgrims but agreed with the decision to impose Section 144. Following criticism from High Court, all restrictions except Section 144 were removed gradually. The Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party launched separate protests demanding the state government to revoke section 144 imposed in Sabarimala. The fifth hartal was on 11 December 2018. Bharatiya Janata Party called this harthal on Thiruvananthapuram District, Kerala. It was in response to police action against Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha march to secretariat on 10 December 2018. A 49-year-old man committed suicide in front of the protest site of BJP on 13 December 2018, following which BJP called for another statewide hartal. It was the sixth hartal invoked by BJP on Sabarimala issue since the beginning of mandalam makaravilakku pilgrim season at Sabarimala and sixth one in the series. BJP alleged that the man who is an Ayyappa devotee, immolated himself, protesting against the restrictions imposed by Kerala government at Sabarimala, but police denied the allegations saying that he committed suicide due to personal reasons and his dying declaration didn't mention anything about Sabarimala. On 26 December, thousands of Ayyapa devotees mainly women, took part in Ayyappa Jyothi, an event organised by Hindutva outfits in protest against supreme court verdict. In some places, the people participating in the event were attacked by CPI(M) and Democratic Youth Federation of India(DYFI) activists. In response, kerala police arrested 16 members who premeditated the attacks. Cases are also filed against 1400 people who took part in the Ayyappa Jyothi event. As a counter protest, a human chain called Vanitha Mathil was formed by women across the state of Kerala supporting the Supreme Court verdict. Around 3-5 million women participated in the event organised by the state government. The seventh hartal was on 3 January 2019. Sabarimala Karma Samithi called a statewide hartal in Kerala and Bharatiya Janata Party supported it. The reason for this hartal was the entry of two women under the age of 40 into Sabarimala Sree Dharmasastha Temple. One of the protestors named Chandran Unnithan belonging to Sabarimala Karma Samiti got injured when CPI(M) members started pelting stones and he died shortly of severe skull injuries. Many cases of violence and arson were reported from across the state during this hartal. Fed up of a series of hartals in connection with Sabarimala women entry issue, trader organisations in Kerala had already decided to observe 2019 as 'anti-hartal year' and to defy all hartals in future. Even though police had promised them adequate protection, shops which opened defying the hartal were widely attacked and some even put to fire. News medias decided to boycott all press conferences by Bharatiya Janata Party following unprovoked targeted attacks on journalists. More than 100 buses of Kerala state road transport corporation were damaged. Offices, libraries and businesses owned by the ruling left party were damaged and incidents of street fights between CPI(M) and BJP cadres were reported from many places. Anticipating further violence, section 144 was imposed in Palakkad and Manjeswaram towns on next day. Attacks against residences of women who tried to enter Sabarimala as well as those who supported the verdict were reported from Kerala. A hotel owned by Kerala Tourism Development Corporation at Chennai was also damaged by unidentified men protesting against women entry in Sabarimala. Leaders of the ruling CPI(M) compared the miscreants unleashing violence over Sabarimala with Taliban and Khalistan terrorists. Successful entries Two women aged below 50 walked into the Sabarimala temple in Kerala before daybreak on 2 January 2019, becoming the first to do so since the Supreme Court ordered the end of an 18 year old restriction by the 1991 Kerala high court judgement on women of menstrual age entering the shrine. Ninety- five days after the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on the entry of women at Sabarimala hill shrine in central Kerala, two activist women, Bindu Ammini, a resident of Koyilandy in Kozhikode district and Kanagadurga a native of Angadipuram in Malappuram district, both in their mid-40s, entered the temple with the escort of police personnel at around 3:45 am on 2 January 2019 Wednesday. They had previously attempted to climb the hill on 24 December, before being blocked by protesters. According to reports, both women had stayed at a secret location, vowing not to return home until they offered prayers at the temple. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan confirmed the entry of the duo at the temple and underlined that the police force was duty- bound to give protection to anyone who asked for security. On 4 January 2019, a 46-year-old woman from Sri Lanka entered the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple and prayed at the sanctum sanctorum. She became the first woman under the age of 50 to have climbed the 18 holy steps with irumudikkettu (offerings to the deity) since the Supreme Court verdict. On 8 January 2019, a 36-year-old woman dalit leader claimed to have entered the temple. A Facebook group called 'Navodhana Keralam Sabarimalayilekku' (that translates to Renaissance Kerala to Sabarimala) has posted a series of videos and photos showing the dalit leader at Sabarimala, to prove the claim. On 18 January 2019, the Government of Kerala has informed the Supreme Court that 51 women of menstrual age dodged protesters to enter the Sabarimala shrine besides the duo during this pilgrimage season. Media has reported several discrepancies in the list submitted by Kerala government like featuring women who have reached menopause and inclusion of a man.

History The MSG Sphere London is a building proposed by The Madison Square Garden Company and if approved, will be identical to the MSG Sphere Las Vegas. Both buildings have been designed by the architectural firm Populous. The venue is proposed to be located in Stratford near Westfield Stratford City, the East Village housing development, and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, built on a site used as a coach park during the 2012 Summer Olympics. The sphere-shaped venue has been designed to have LED screens on the inside and outside and designed to have a seating capacity of 18,000. The Madison Square Garden Company claims that the London metropolitan area has two large capacity venues for concerts, and that the MSG Sphere intends to help meet the demands of the London market. According to the official MSG website, public comments were reviewed at the end of 2018. Opposition AEG, which operates the O2 Arena in south-east London, raised a question mark over the Sphere's proximity to existing entertainment venues such as the London Stadium, the Copper Box Arena, and the O2 Arena, emphasising that \\"it is imperative that MSG's proposals do not add to congestion in the area\\". Others have highlighted that there is a shortage of affordable housing in the surrounding London Borough of Newham, which has more than 25,000 households on its housing waiting list. They claim that up to 1,400 houses could be built in place of the planned venue, and noted that plans for a \\"snow dome\\" ski centre in the same location, backed by former London mayor Boris Johnson, were scrapped in 2016. Local residents have also set up a petition against the Sphere proposal as well as a website highlighting their concerns. On June the 5th 2019, London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), the planning authority for the site, held a public consultation with the public during which the residents had a chance to voice their concerns. On June 14, 2019, Hackney council rejected plans by Madison Square Garden chiefs to display giant illuminated adverts on the dome of the sphere. Proposed features The MSG Sphere is set to be equipped with a 19,000 by 13,500 resolution LED screen which will spread across the interior of the venue. All 21,500 seats will have high speed internet access and the sound system uses a technology called beam forming to provide targeted, spatialized sound that is consistent in volume and quality across all seats. Haptic capabilities will be delivered through the floorboards. The exterior of the venue will wrapped by an LED display, allowing those who are outside of the venue to see what is going on inside.The MSG Sphere: The Future of Live Concert Experiences The external LEDs will also be used for various types of content, including advertising purposes. Proposals also include a 3,000 person club venue in addition to the 21,500 seats. On the outside the proposal will feature 1 million pixels, each pixel equipped with 36 LED lights covering a surface of 190,000 ft¬≤. Transport links The MSG Sphere will be accessible through a variety of mass transit links, including rail and bus. There are no proposals to extend Stratford Station or to provide parking. Rail The MSG Sphere London will be accessible via the London Underground's Central line and Jubilee line at the Stratford station. Spectators will also be able to access the MSG Sphere via Docklands Light Railway at Stratford station and Stratford International station. The North London line of the London Overground also stops at Stratford station. National Rail and Crossrail customers will be able to access the venue via Statford station. Bus Spectators will be able to access the venue via bus through the Stratford City bus station and the Stratford bus station.

He was unraced as a two-year-old in 2016 but in the following year he won the Hampton Court Stakes and was placed in both the Craven Stakes and the Dante Stakes as well as finishing fifth in the Epsom Derby. In 2018 he began the season in Dubai where he won the Singspiel Stakes and the Al Rashidiya before defeating a strong international field in the Dubai Turf. On his return to Europe he won the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen in Germany and was then sent to Australia where he took the Caulfield Stakes and ran second in the Cox Plate. Background Benbatl is a bay horse with a white star bred in England by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud and owned by the Godolphin organisation. He was sent into training with Saeed bin Suroor whose horses are based at Newmarket, Suffolk in summer but typically spend the winter at Godolphin's base in Dubai. He was sired by Dubawi a top-class son of Dubai Millennium, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Benbatl is the first foal of his dam Nahrain who won the Prix de l'Op√©ra in 2011 and the Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes in 2012. Nahrain was a daughter of the Ribblesdale Stakes winner Bahr, who was in turn a granddaughter of La Mer. Racing career 2017: three-year-old season Benbatl made his racecourse debut on 2 April 2017 when he started the 15/8 favourite for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in which he was ridden by Josephine Gordon and won \\"readily\\" by seven lengths from eleven opponents. The colt was immediately moved up in class and distance for the Group 3 Craven Stakes over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse and finished third behind Eminent and Rivet, beaten two lengths by the winner. At York Racecourse in May he contested the Group 2 Dante Stakes (a major trial race the Epsom Derby) over ten furlongs. He started the 4/1 favourite but after briefly taking the lead in the straight he was beaten into second place by the Mark Johnston-trained Permian, with Crystal Ocean and Rekindling in third and fourth. In the 2017 Epsom Derby was the least-fancied of the three Godolphin runners and started a 20/1 outsider. After turning into the straight last of the eighteen runners he made steady progress and came home fifth behind Wings of Eagles, Cliffs of Moher, Cracksman and Eminent. Nineteen days later at Royal Ascot the colt started the 9/2 second choice in the betting behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Orderofthegarter in the Group 3 Hampton Court Stakes over ten furlongs. Ridden by Oisin Murphy, he tracked the leaders, went to the front approaching the final furlong and stayed on strongly to win by half a length from Orderofthegarter. After the race Saeed bin Suroor said \\"today's trip was brilliant for him. He was in a nice position and kicked really well. He is a nice horse for the future. We will keep the options open. He could be anything\\". Benbatl returned to the highest class and took on older horses for the first time in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on 29 July. He never looked likely to win but \\"plugged on\\" in the straight to come home fifth behind Enable, Ulysses, Idaho and Highland Reel. On his final run of the year the colt failed to show his best form, finishing sixth when favourite for the Group 3 Superior Mile on heavy ground at Haydock Park in September. 2018: four-year-old season Winter and spring: Dubai For the winter and early spring of 2018 Benbatl was relocated to Godolphin's racing base in Dubai was campaigned at Meydan Racecourse, being ridden in all his races by Oisin Murphy. He began his campaign in the Group 3 Singspiel Stakes over 1800 metre on 11 January in which he started favourite and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and quarter lengths from Emotionless. In the Group 2 Al Rashidiya over the same course and distance on 1 February he won \\"easily\\" by almost four lengths from Bay of Poets having taken the lead 300 metres from the finish. The colt was expected to complete a hat-trick in the Group 1 Jebel Hatta on 10 March but in a slowly-run race he was unable to run down Godolphin's outsider Blair House and was beaten three quarters of a length into second place. Three weeks after the Jebel Hatta Benbatl met Blair House again in the Dubai Turf, with Murphy's mount starting the 4/1 favourite. Among the other 13 runners were Coolmore's Lancaster Bomber, the Darley Stakes winner Monarch's Glen and a five-horse Japanese contingent including Vivlos (winner of the race in 2017), Real Steel (winner in 2016) and Neorealism (Queen Elizabeth II Cup). After tracking the front-runner Janoobi, Benbatl took the lead in the straight and drew away to win easily by more than three lengths from Vivlos. Murphy commented \\"Last time [in the Jebel Hatta] I gave the horse a bad ride and it was very good of Sheikh Mohammed and Saeed to give me another chance on him. I was determined to make amends and once in that position I was pretty sure I would win. It's very hard to find a world-class horse to ride, but he is a horse you dream about. He's very talented and today he had a good trip and showed his class. Today everything fell right.\\" Summer: Europe On his first appearance after his return to Europe, Benbatl started 11/4 favourite against twelve opponents in the Group 1 Queen Anne Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot in June. Ridden by Christophe Soumillon he was among the early leaders and briefly gained the advantage two furlongs out before fading badly and coming home in tenth place behind the 33/1 upset winner Accidental Agent. He was then moved back up in trip and sent to Germany for the Group 1 Bayerisches Zuchtrennen over 2000 metres at Munich on 29 July. The only other foreign challenger was the British-trained Stormy Antarctic, while the seven German runners were headed by Iquitos, the 2016 German Horse of the Year. With Murphy in the saddle, Benbatl took the lead soon after the start and drew away from his rivals in the straight to win by two and three quarter lengths from Stormy Antarctic. Saeed bin Suroor said \\"He made all and the pace suited him as he was still on the bridle with two furlongs to go. I'm very pleased with him and we'll now look at our options\\", suggesting that the colt might be sent to Australia to take on the great mare Winx in the Cox Plate. On his third and final European start of 2018, Benbatl was ridden by Jim Crowley when he was sent off at odds of 10/1 for the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse on 22 August. He briefly took the lead approaching the last quarter mile but was soon overtaken and came home fifth behind Roaring Lion, Poet's Word, Thundering Blue and Saxon Warrior. He was struck into during the race and sustained cuts to his legs. After the race he entered quarantine to prepare for his journey to Australia. Autumn: Australia Benbatl arrived in Australia on 29 September as part of a large Godolphin team which also included Blair House and Best Solution. On 13 October he made his Australian debut in the Group 1 Ladbrokes Stakes (better known as the Caulfield Stakes) over 2000 metres at Caulfield Racecourse and started at odds of 8/1 in an eleven-runner field which included his fellow imports Blair House and Cliffs of Moher. The Rosehill Guineas winner D'Argento started favourite while the other local runners included Humidor (Memsie Stakes, Australian Cup), Unforgotten (Australian Oaks) and Homesman (Underwood Stakes). After breaking quickly from the starting stalls, Benbatl was settled in second place by his new jockey Pat Cosgrave as Homesman set the pace. He took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and got the better of a sustained struggle with his old rival Blair House to win by a short head. When asked about the colt's prospects against Winx in the Cox Plate Cosgrave said \\"I think he is going to be on his A-game to win that is for sure. She's a great mare. I don't know if I want to ride him. If I did happen to beat her I would have to scurry out of the country fairly quick\\". On 27 October Benbatl started second favourite for the Cox Plate at Moonee Valley Racecourse After settling in third behind Rostropovich and D'Argento he moved up on the outside to dispute the lead on the final turn. He was soon overtaken by Winx, but kept on well for second, two lengths behind the winner. His rider Oisin Murphy said \\"Winx was completely dominant. I gave it my best shot and so did Benbatl... I thought I‚Äôd give her a race and in fairness to him, he didn‚Äôt stop. He hit the line but she was just too good. Full credit to everyone\\". In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Benbatl was given a rating of 123, making him the fourteenth best horse in the world. 2019: five-year-old season Benbatl was given a long break in 2019 and did not return to the track until 27 September when he contested the Group 2 Joel Stakes over one mile at Newmarket and started 4/1 second favourite behind the three-year-old King of Comedy. He was sent into the lead by Murphy from the start and drew away in the final furlong to beat King of Comedy by five lengths. Saeed bin Suroor indicated that the horse would be aimed at the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes while Murphy commented \\"I haven't slept much this week with excitement. There was no pressure on today as it was a prep run, but he hasn't had a slap and he was electric. It's a fantastic feeling. He is the best around\\". On his only other race of the year he started favourite for the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October but appeared to be unsuited by the heavy ground and finished last of the sixteen runners. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Benbatl was given a rating of 125, making him the ninth best racehorse in the world.

Taxonomy   Description  The tribe was created in 1945 by the American paleontologist and theoretical biologist George Gaylord Simpson. According to the Simpson classification the tribe comprises two monospecific genera: * Tribus Saigini ** Genus Pantholops *** Pantholops hodgsonii ** Genus Saiga *** Saiga tatarica  A controversial taxonomy  Saiga and Pantholops are problematic genera in taxonomy. Saiga was traditionally classified as a member of the tribe Saigini, within the subfamily CaprinaeBannikov, A.; L. Zhirnov; Lebedeva & Fadeev, A (1967): \\"Biology of the Saiga\\". Israel Program for Scientifica Translatios, Jerusalem. but some authors suggested that the genus Saiga was closer to the subfamily Antilopinae. In 2000 Groves analyzed the morphological characters of Procapra, Prodorcas and Saiga, and proposed three basal groups of Antilopinae, one of which included a clade Saiga + Procapra.Groves, C. P. (2000). \\"Phylogenetic relationships within recent Antlopini (Bovidae). In: Elizabeth S. Vrba and George B. Schaller, eds. Antelopes, Deer, and Relatives: Fossil Record, Behavioral Ecology, Systematics, and Conservation. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. , pp. 223-233. The genus Panthalops is monotypic (P. hodgsonii), and is sometimes included in the tribe Saigini on the basis of similar morphological features, most of which are plesiomorphic. However, molecular and morphological findings suggest that Pantholops hodgsonii should be classified more correctly in the subfamily Caprinae, but the status of the Tibetan gazelle in this subfamily remains uncertain. Data on cytochrome b and small portions of 12S and 16S ribosomal genes suggest phylogenetic affinities of Saiga and Procapra with Antilopinae. However, these studies do not clarify the close relationships within this clade. Given this uncertainty, some authors have suggested that the Saigini taxon should be abandoned.

He was the son of Hofmarskalk (Lord Steward of the Household) Theodor Christian Brun Fr√∏lich (1834‚Äì1904) and Bodil Christina (Stina) Gr√∏nn (1834‚Äì1901). In 1897 he married (Clara Constance Rosalie) Aim√©e Thaulow Knutsen (1873‚Äì1948). Their son was the fencer Jens Fr√∏lich (1914‚Äì1938), who competed in the individual and team foil events at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Their grandsons were jazz musicians Theodor Christian Fr√∏lich ¬´Totti¬ª Bergh (1935‚Äì2012) and his brother Johs. Bergh (1932‚Äì2001). Early career After examen artium from Gjertsen's Skole (1888) Fr√∏lich studied medicine at the University of Oslo and gained the cand.med degree in 1895. He was a general practitioner in Larvik and Sandefjord Spa and returned to Kristiania in 1896 as chief physician at Rikshospitalet, the departement of pediatrics. He did research on diabetes in children, resulting in his doctorate (dr.med) in 1903. Fr√∏lich then joined professor Axel Holst (1860‚Äì1931) at the University Institute of Hygiene to study scurvy, suspected of being a nutritional deficiency among fishermen, then called shipboard beri- beri. Holst and Fr√∏lich established an animal model that allowed systematic study of factors that led to the ship-related dietary disease, as well as the preventive value of different substances. They discovered that scurvy occurred in guinea pigs when fed solely with various types of grain, either whole or baked into bread, and these symptoms were prevented when the diet was supplemented with known antiscorbutics like fresh cabbage or lemon juice. Fr√∏lich published his results in 1910 and 1912 and identified vitamin C before the essential idea of vitamins had been introduced, maybe the single most important piece of vitamin C research. In 1920 Fr√∏lich was appointed Professor of pediatrics at the Oslo University. He engaged in research on tuberculosis, became president of Nasjonalforeningen mot tuberkulosen (the National Society Against Tuberculosis), and initiated the preventive Tuberculin skin test for school children. In Norway Fr√∏lich was also renowned for Dr. Fr√∏lichs Cough Syrup, a sweetened extract of Carapichea ipecacuanha.

This followed a report by the in 2017. Wilbert Bannenberg, an epidemiologist, is the chairman. The group plans to deploy both health and pharmaceutical expertise and lawyers. They have investigated 12 cases all with the same business model, which they describe as: \\"buy an old, cheap product, get the old versions off the market, win orphan drug designation, and put up the price as high as you can.\\" They say that European orphan drug legislation needs to be reformed. It plans to make a referral to the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets in respect of the pricing policy of Leadiant Biosciences Ltd, formerly known as Sigma-Tau Rare Disease, for chenodeoxycholic acid which is used to treat about 60 children with cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis in the Netherlands. The company now sells this medicine at ‚Ç¨140 per capsule, about ‚Ç¨153,300 per patient per year. Previously it was sold under the name Chenofalk for the treatment of gallstones at a cost of ‚Ç¨0.28 per capsule and used off label for the treatment of cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis. Sigma-Tau acquired the rights in 2008. The European Medicines Agency approved chenodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Leadiant, having secured orphan drug designation, and bought up rival suppliers, raised the price, as they were entitled to ten years market exclusivity in the European Union. Bannenberg claims that Leadiant is abusing its dominant market position. The VU University Medical Center are proposing to manufacture their own version at cost price, and this has been supported by Dutch health insurers. Leadiant has been compared to Martin Shkreli. Bannanberg is quoted as saying ‚ÄúThis may be legal but it‚Äôs not socially acceptable.‚Äù The foundation's complaints have been echoed by Bruno Bruins, Minister for Medical Care. Under political pressure, the pharmaceutical companies in the Netherlands have been working on a code of conduct which they say will provide guarantees for responsible pricing, and keep speculators out of the door.

He left the Southern Netherlands after the fall of Antwerp in 1585. He moved to Frankenthal in 1586 where he was a member of a large community of Flemish artists and merchants who had also emigrated from Flanders. Many of the Flemish artists who moved to Frankenthal were landscape painters. They were later referred to as the school of Frankenthal. The school of Frankenthal included the painters Gillis van Coninxloo, Pieter Schoubroeck, Anton Mirou and Hendrik van der Borcht the elder and the latter's son. In Frankenthal these artists could count on Flemish art dealers such as Cornelis Caymox who had settled there earlier and had built a network of patrons for Flemish art. Gijsmans and his son are recorded as having supplied Caymox with paintings on cloth.Martin Papenbrock, Landschaften des Exils: Gillis van Coninxloo und die Frankenthaler Maler, B√∂hlau Verlag K√∂ln Weimar, 2001, pp. 40-41 Gijsmans was successful and thrived in his adopted new home and became the mayor of Frankenthal in 1609/1610. He may have been the teacher of Anton Mirou, another Flemish √©migr√© artist.Anton Mirou at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He remained in Frankenthal until his death in 1611-1612. Work Hendrik Gijsmans was a painter and draftsman of landscapes and a tapestry designer. None of his paintings have been preserved. There are records in 1588 of the presence of three paintings (including two views of Antwerp) and in 1595 another three works (a view of the Castle Garden in Brussels and two sieges of Antwerp) in the Kunstkammer in Dresden where they are mentioned until 1603. A Viennese inventory dated after 1619 mentions another siege of Antwerp and three landscapes on parchment. View of San Vittore al Corpo and San Martino in Milan Hendrik Gijsmans is now known only through his drawings. The art historian Cornelius von Fabriczy published in 1893 for the first time fifty views of Flanders, France and Italy which were in the collection of the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. The works were ascribed to an anonymous artist who was given the notname Anonymous Fabriczy. The unknown artist was identified with Hendrik Gijsmans by Stijn Alsteens (Hans Buijs, V√©ronique Mathot, Willem Schellinks, Paysages de France: dessin√©s par Lambert Doomer et les artistes hollandais et flamands des XVIe et XVIIe si√®cles, Fondation Custodia, 2008, pp. 221‚Äì226). This was thanks to the discovery of a drawing representing Saint-Vallier in the Rhone Valley, which had been acquired by the Louvre Museum and was datable to 1567 or later. This drawing carried the inscription Henrick Gh√øsm : F. The drawing in the Louvre turned out to be a first version of one of the views preserved in the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. This identification led to the attribution to Gijsmans of almost all the 50 drawings in the Staatsgalerie formerly ascribed to Anonymous Fabriczy. Part of the drawings of Stuttgart were likely part of a notebook some of the pages of which have become dispersed. View of the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome under construction The Flemish origins of the author of the drawings in Stuttgart are not only confirmed by the inclusion among the drawings of views of cities in the Southern Netherlands such as Antwerp, Dendermonde, Brussels and Huy, but also by a style similar to the refined graphics of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The works show Gijsmans to be one of Bruegel's principal followers. His drawings show the artist's considerable talent for representing nature as well as architecture. Some of the Italian views, made in Rome and Milan, can be dated between 1565 and 1568. It is therefore likely that the views of France date from shortly before or shortly after these years and were made during Gijsmans' outward journey to, or his return from, Italy.

Specifically, it is focused on measuring ions escaping from the atmosphere of Pluto during the 2015 flyby. It is one of seven major scientific instruments aboard the spacecraft. The spacecraft was launched in 2006, flewby Jupiter the following year, and went on flyby Pluto in 2015 where PEPSI was able to record and transmit back to Earth the planned data collections. PEPSSI is designed to help understand the rate of atmospheric loss from the atmosphere of Pluto into space, which is thought experience comet-like atmosphere loss into outer space. These ions blend in with the surrounding solar wind which passed by Pluto. During the flyby PEPSSI sent data back to Earth every day. During the journey to Pluto, PEPSSI was also used to record data about the interplanetary medium. Data about Jupiter and its magnetotail was also collected by PEPSSI during its 2007 flyby of that planet. Beyond Pluto and into the Kuiper belt, PEPSSI can be used to study how the solar wind interacts with interstellar wind, adding to the data pile from the Voyager's which also exited the solar system in a similar direction as the trajectory of New Horizons. One of the expectations that was not confirmed by PEPSSI was that sunlight would make a large bubble of ionized gases around Pluto from its atmosphere. Kelly Beatty - Pluto‚Äôs Atmosphere Confounds Researchers (March 25, 2016) - Sky & Telescope Magazine PEPSSI found that the rate of atmospheric loss was only 0.01 percent of what was anticipated, and the region of interaction with the solar wind was much smaller than expected. Design PEPSSI is one of the seven major instruments on New Horizons, and along with SWAP is designed to detect ions. Ions come in and pass through two foils, which when they pass through these foils they are timed, then they hit a solid state detector. The time of flight between the two foils helps determine the particles mass, and the detector measures the energy, and from this the composition of the particle can be determined within certain parameters. The instrument is designed to \\"taste\\" the atmosphere of Pluto, and design is oriented towards being low weight, low power, and understanding the nature of atmospheric loss from Pluto. PEPPSI is a compact low-power ion measurement device, and it is a time of flight type of instrument The design detects ions from about 10 keV to 1 MeV in a fan shaped160 degree by 12 degree arc. The device has a mass of 1.5 kg (3.31 lb) and can consume about 2.5 watts of electrical power. The ionized particles pass through two microchannel plates, with the time recorded for the time between these detections. After passing through this section, there is a solid state silicon detector. The design avoided using magnets for the time of flight section, which enhanced weight and/or power savings for the instrument. The 160 by 12 degree field of view is covered by six detectors each with a 25 by 12 degree field of view. By noting which detector the particle has arrived at, its overall direction of input can be noted. To meet the low power use and weight requirements, the device made use of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). PEPSSI is based on an instrument that was on board the Discovery program's MESSENGER (planet Mercury orbiter, launched 2004/ended 2015) called the Energetic Particle Spectrometer. PEPSSI complements the focus of SWAP, which is oriented towards lower energy ions. Whereas PEPSSi measures ions with energies from about 10 keV to 1000 keV, SWAP measures ions from 25 to 7.5 keV. PEPSSI has an enhanced design to reduce weight and power consumption having to do with electron detection, with heritage going back the 1980s and 1990s. The instrument on MESSENGER was based on an instrument for that periods proposals for a Pluto flyby mission. The design can trace back to some heritage to instruments in the 1980s for detecting ions.McNutt, et all - The Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI) on the New Horizons Mission Specifications Specs: *Mass: 1.5 kilograms (3.31 pounds); 1475 grams *Power use: ‚àº2.5 watts *Field of view: 160¬∞√ó12¬∞ *Ion energy detection range: 20 keV to 1 MeV See also *MAVEN (Mars orbiter that also focused on studying planetary atmospheric interaction with the solar system medium) *Coma (cometary) *JEDI (energetic particle detector on the Jupiter orbiter of the 2010s) *Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (spacecraft instruments detects ions) *IS‚òâIS (energetic particle detector instrument on the Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018 to the Sun) *List of New Horizons topics *Pepsi (similar sounding American soft-drink, also sent into space on Space Shuttle) *Pickup ions References External links *NASA - New Horizons instruments *PEPSSI Pluto encounter data link *New Horizons PEPSSI Pluto Encounter Calibrated Data v3.0 Category:New Horizons Category:Spacecraft instruments ","title":"Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation"},{"id":"58832791","text":"DWBC (87.9 FM), broadcasting as 87.9 Radyo Bi√±an, is a low-power community radio station owned and operated by the Bi√±an City Government.

Work  Blending both the interior and the exterior world of queer black males in various emotional states of pain, pleasure, tenderness, and despair, Chase draws and paints scenes that are both poetic and visceral. Chase practice is a process of traditional and digital collage, drawing, photography, poetry, archiving, and research. Chases's figurative paintings stand stylistically beside peers Louis Fratino, Nicole Eisenman, and Carroll Dunham, and equally reference the erotic woodblock prints of Ukiyo-e. Artist and curator Tiona Nekkia McClodden writes of Chase's paintings, \\"The figures mirror each other, touch each other ‚Ä¶ reach through each other. They are layered, they are tender and have a necessary roughness. Lovemaking, or rather loving oneself is like this. There is the way he allows a reversed negative x-ray transparency to look through certain parts of the body.\\" Art critic Holland Cotter notes of the exhibition, \\"Quiet Storm‚Äù ‚Äî which refers to a genre of mellow, primarily African-American pop music ‚Äî there is nothing the least quiet about Mr. Chase‚Äôs exuberant brushwork, or his images of glittered- splashed flesh and gay coupledom.\\" Writer Miss Rosen says of Chase, \\"Imagine the love child of Missy Elliott and Romare Bearden, raised by Ren & Stimpy, and embracing the intimacies of James Baldwin‚Äôs Giovanni‚Äôs Room ‚Ä¶ and you can begin to grasp the intricate complexities and exquisite nuances of African- American artist Jonathan Lyndon Chase.\\" Chase notes artists Romare Bearden, Alison Saar, Marlon Riggs, Robert Colescott, Alice Neel, and Kerry James Marshall as key inspirations as well as culture and fashion from the1980s and 1990s, Afrofuturism, and science-fiction in relationship to black and queer narratives.

He reassumed the post in 1961 and held it until April 1963, when he was appointed Minister of Minister of Middle Classes and Community Development. He resigned from the government in September.  Biography  Joseph Lutula was born on 6 October 1927 in the village of Usumba-Wembo-Nyama, Katako-Kombe Territory, Belgian Congo to a Tetela family. He was schooled by Methodists alongside Patrice Lumumba. In 1947 he moved to Stanleyville and stayed with Lumumba and Paul Kimbulu. Lutula worked as a clerk in the colonial administration. He served as the secretary of a Protestant Tetela association in L√©opoldville. Later, several Tetela syndicates conglomerated into the Groupement Batetela and Lutula was chosen as its secretary. Lutula joined the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), and after the party split he aligned himself with Lumumba's faction, serving on the central committee. In March 1960 Okito participated in the Akutshu-Anamongo Congress of Lodja, serving as one of the conference's secretaries. The participants resolved to create an Association des Akutshu- Anamongo to assist the MNC in the upcoming general elections in Kasai Province, and Lutula was given control of its permanent secretariat. Lutula ran on an MNC-Lumumba ticket in the May elections in the Sankuru District. He received 11,917 preferential votes and won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies. He was appointed by Prime Minister Lumumba to serve as Minister of Agriculture in his government of the newly independent Republic of the Congo. Lutula and Lumumba were its only members to come from Sankuru. The government was officially invested by Parliament on 24 June 1960. He was dismissed by President Joseph Kasa-Vubu on 12 September. After Lumumba was killed in Katanga in early February 1961, he accompanied Lumumba's widow, Pauline Opango, as she led a demonstration to the United Nations office in L√©opoldville to ask for assistance in recovering his body. Following the execution of numerous Lumumba supporters in Bakwanga over the course of the month, Lutula fled L√©opoldville and joined Antoine Gizenga's government in Stanleyville as Minister of Agriculture. After a national political reconciliation in August, Lutula resumed his position in the central government under Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula. On 17 April 1963 Adoula reshuffled his cabinet and made him Minister of Minister of Middle Classes and Community Development. He resigned in September. In the 1970s Lutula moved to Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville), but in the late 1980s he returned to Kinshasa (formerly L√©opoldville). He died at 20:00 on 17 March 2008 at the Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital in Kinshasa following cardiac issues.

Its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 9.91, but drops down to 12.45 every 1.357 days. Its variability matches the behaviour of Algol variable stars. System The primary star of the system has a mass of 3.2 and has a spectral type A4IV-V, meaning that it has intermediate characteristics between a main sequence star and a subgiant one. The secondary is less massive (1.3 ) but larger than the primary, so it's an evolved subgiant star and its spectral type is G5IV. The secondary component will likely evolve into a white dwarf before the primary leaves the main sequence. Variability Photometric periods of Algol variables matches the orbital period of the system. However, in XZ Andromedae have been observed slight period variations that can be reproduced with three different cycles of 137.5, 36.8 and 11.2 years, respectively. Each of them could be the effect of another faint body orbiting the binary system, but one of the two shorter cycles could also be an effect of magnetic interaction between stars (the Applegate mechanism). Other research states that the long cycle is instead a long-term period increase caused by mass transfer from the secondary (that fills its Roche lobe) to the primary component.

The topiary garden, officially the Topiary Garden at Old Deaf School Park, is designed to depict figures from George Seurat's 1884 painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. It is the only park based entirely on a painting. The park is formally known as Deaf School Park, or Old Deaf School Park, as it was part of the campus of the Ohio School for the Deaf. It is owned by the city of Columbus and maintained by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department. Description Columbus Metropolitan Library to the park The park's gatehouse The park is located in downtown Columbus. It features topiaries trimmed into life-size shapes of men, women, children, animals, and boats and arranged to resemble the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Specifically, there are topiaries of 54 people, eight boats, three dogs, a monkey, and a cat. It also hosts 220 trees, including 35 different species. The park hosts jazz concerts. The park is adjacent to the Main Branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library system. The branch was renovated around 2015, with one of the architect's goals being to join the library to the park. The gatehouse, near the southeast corner of the park, is the park's main entrance. The building holds offices, restrooms, and an information desk and gift shop. It was constructed in 1998, designed in brick and resembling a French countryside house to match the park's theme. The building was funded by the City of Columbus, Motorists Mutual Insurance, and the Friends of the Topiary Park. History The land originated as part of the campus of the Ohio School for the Deaf, and a dormitory was built there for the school. When the school moved locations in 1953, the neighborhood declined. Most of the school's buildings burned down in 1981, leading to the development of the park, which helped revitalize the area. The park was first developed in the mid-1980s as Old Deaf School Park. Topiary Park and its garden was conceived by Columbus artists James and Elaine Mason. It was built as a garden exhibit for the AmeriFlora exhibition that took place in Columbus in 1992, and was sculpted in 1989, along with installation of hills and a small pond, meant to represent the River Seine.

Converts to the Mennonite faith are both people who speak Spanish and groups with an indigenous Amerindian background, notably Ash√°ninka. These converts do not differ much from other Protestants in Peru. Ethnic German Mennonites started to settle in Peru in 2015, with two colonies coming from Bolivia and one colony coming from Belize. These ethnic German Mennonites have their own customs and language (Plautdietsch) and live in colonies. Very Conservative ethnic Mennonites normally do not engage in missionary activities but look for a quiet and remote place where they can live according to their tradition.  History  Mennonites as a religious group can trace back their roots to the time of the Protestant Reformation. They belonged to the radical wing of the Reformation who tried to base its faith only on the Bible as God's word and live according to it. Starting in 1683 (Germantown, Pennsylvania), Mennonites from Europe migrated to North America but most came in the 18th and 19th centuries. Mainly since the second half of the 19th century they split into different groups ranging from extremely conservative to very liberal. Liberal and conservative Mennonites engaged in worldwide missionary work like other North American Protestant denominations. Around the year 1950 the Krimmer Mennonite Brethren started missionary work in the eastern part of Peru in the Amazon rainforest. When the Krimmer Mennonite Brethren merged with the Mennonite Brethren in 1960, the Mennonite Brethren Board of Missions and Services (BOMAS) assumed responsibility for this work. In 1987 the work was continued in association with the Wycliffe Bible Translators, the Swiss Indian Mission, and the South America Mission. The Mennonite Brethren Church of Peru, Spanish Iglesia Evang√©lica de los Hermanos Menonitas del Per√∫, was officially recognized in 1986 by the government of Peru. In 2015 two Mennonite colonies called Wanderland (Vanderland) in Ucayali Province and √ñsterreich (Usterreich) in Hu√°nuco Region were founded by Ethnic German Mennonites from Bolivia.

Helburn‚Äôs won more than 46 professional awards for magazine and television ads.  Early life  William Helburn was born in New York City. He attended public and private schools in Manhattan and also took classes at The Art Students League of New York, before joining the U.S. Army Air Force in 1942. Helburn served in the Pacific theatre where he and future partner Ted Croner learned to make contact sheets and develop film, including the first pictures of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima.  Becoming a photographer  Following the war Helburn and Croner resolved to become fashion photographers after Croner, on a weekend ski trip to Stowe, Vermont, encountered photographer Fernand Fonssagrives taking nude pictures of his model wife Lisa in the snow. After an encouraging visit to Fonssagrives studio, Helburn and Croner rented studio space in Manhattan and began taking pictures of aspiring models. The two men soon enrolled in Harper‚Äôs Bazaar Art Director Alexey Brodovitch‚Äôs Design Laboratory, a workshop for aspiring photographers and graphic designers. While the partnership with Croner soon ended, studying with Brodovitch led to Helburn‚Äôs first major assignment as a professional, a ten- page editorial shoot in the March 1949 edition of Junior Bazaar (a supplement to Harper‚Äôs Bazaar).  Helburn, Doyle Dane Bernbach, and The Creative Revolution in advertising  1949 also saw the launch of Doyle Dane Bernbach, the agency that would spark advertising‚Äôs creative revolution. While Helburn photographed for numerous agencies, he worked frequently for Doyle Dane, teaming with art directors including Robert Gage, Helmut Krone, and Gene Federico. As an advertising photographer, Helburn shot for accounts including Oleg Cassini, Van Heusen, Cole of California, Supima Cotton, Cuddle Coat, Napier Jewelry, Ohrbachs, Volkswagen, DKW Auto Union, Cadillac, Chrysler, Buick, Polaroid, Coca-Cola, Revlon, Helene Curtis, Yardley, and Max Factor.  Auto racing  After buying a Ferrari Testarossa, Helburn raced, either for Team Ferrari or as an independent, in events sanctioned by the National Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Cuban Sport Commission, between 1956 and 1961. In 1957, his most active year, Helburn raced eight times, with his team finishing second at the SCCA Regional Thompson, fifth in the Cuban Grand Prix and ninth in the Nassau Trophy Race. Helburn raced just once in 1961, finishing ninth in the Sebring 12-Hour Florida International Grand Prix.  Later career  Helburn continued to work as a fashion and advertising photographer through the early 1980s. As his career as a still photographer declined, Helburn shot and directed television commercials for accounts including The Partnership for A Drug-Free America, Mobil Oil and Napier Jewelers.

The focal point of the Cabellera vs. Cabellera series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. For the September 2017 Cabellera vs. Cabellera event IWRG veteran Bombero Infernal faced off against Eterno. Eterno defeated the veteran Bombero Infernal, forcing him to have all his hair shaved off as a result. In the semi-main event match the father/son team Los Warriors (Black Warrior and Warrior Jr. defeated Black Terry and Diablo Jr. to win the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship for the first time. The show included five additional matches Background In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so- called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. By the same token a wrestler betting his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas is seen as highly prestigious, usually a step below the mask match. Event The September 2017 Cabellera vs. Cabellera event featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The third match of the night was announced as a \\"Super Libre\\" match, a hardcore wrestling match supposedly with no rules. For unexplained reasons Demonio Infernal was disqualified, giving the match to Lunatic Xtreme. The fifth match of the night was a non-title match between IWRG Rey del Ring Champion Imposible and third- generation wrestler Villano III Jr. Even though Villano III Jr. lost the match he still made a challenge for the Rey del Ring championship, a challenge that Imposible did not agree to that night. In the sixth match, the semi-main event the team of Black Terry and Diablo Jr. defended the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship against the father/son team of Black Warrior and Warrior Jr., collectively known as \\"Los Warriors\\". Terry and Diablo Jr's reign lasted 190 days in total as Los Warriors pinned them to become the 31st team to hold the championship. The ongoing storyline between veteran Bombero Infernal and the much younger Eterno was on full display as Eterno kept mocking Bombero throughout the match. By the end of the match both competitors were covered in blood as a result of several brutal moves. In the end Eterno pinned Bomber Infernal and celebrated while Bombero Infernal had all his hair shaved off as a result of the stipulations.

It originally housed the Liebfrauenkirche (church of our Lady), which was demolished at the beginning of the 19th century and whose outline can still be seen today on the square, and marks the transition between the cathedral and the Rhine in the direction of the Fischtor, one of the eastward city gates.  History  On the square east of the Liebfrauenkirche was originally the Heumarkt (hay market), later \\"March√© aux foins\\".[:file:Le guide de la ville de Mayence.jpg|Le guide de la ville de Mayence] contenant la d√©nomination de ses six sections, rues, maisons et de leurs num√©ros, ainsi que des habitans avec leurs qualit√©s, √©tats, professions ou m√©tiers. Pfeiffer, Mainz An IX'[=1800] The Liebfrauenkirche, which had previously dominated the square, was built in 1069 by Archbishop Siegfried I. and had to be rebuilt several times after fires between 1285 and 1793. In the course of the Siege of Mainz (1793) the church was bombed by Prussian and Austrian artillery. The new bishop Joseph Ludwig Colmar could not save all religious buildings in Mainz, so her stones were sold. After the demolition of the church in 1807, the present much larger square was built east of the cathedral. The stone material of the old church was used for the construction of the Kastel fortress and for the improvement of the Finthen highway. In 1829 the square was given a clear contour when the Prussian Main Guardroom was built on the southern rim. This guardroom lost its military function in 1902. Today only the fa√ßade, restored in 2002, remains of the original building.Eintrag zur preu√üischen Hauptwache on regionalgeschichte.net Trees at Liebfrauenplatz (2011) Karl G√∂ttelmann was Lord Mayor in Mainz, when in 1916 nail column was erected at the Liebfrauenplatz.Mainz nnail ColumnNagels√§ule in Mainz auf regionalgeschichte.net After the bombing of Mainz in World War II, some buildings at the rim of the square were missing, which led to a further enlargement. The House Zum R√∂mischen Kaiser, of which only parts remained, was rebuilt with a reconstructed fa√ßade; the site where the former House Zum Englischen K√∂nig stood remained undeveloped and enlarged Liebfrauenplatz. At that time, the architectural historian Karl Gruber recommended the delimitation of the square by the construction of two low buildings. Since such a plan was not feasible due to the already existing garrison Main Guardroom, Gruber developed an alternative concept with the planting of trees. Until 1963, trams in Mainz crossed the square. On the occasion of the millennial of the construction start of the cathedral in 1975, Liebfrauenplatz was transformed into a pedestrian zone. A part of the square is used as a public green area with changing flower plantings, while the rest is dedicated to the public for walking and (apart from market days) cycling. At the east of the square, the Gutenberg Museum, founded in 1901 at another location, has been located since the 1920s. Starting from the House Zum R√∂mischen Kaiser, the museum was enlarged in 1962 with a new building designed by architect Rainer Schell. The construction of an extension building on Liebfrauenplatz, the so-called Bibelturm (bibel tower), had been in planning since 2016. On 15 April 2018, in the first referendum in the history of the city, 77% of the voters rejected the realisation of this plan.  Regular events  Gautschen during Johannisnacht, 2010 On Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays the farmer's market takes place on a part of Liebfrauenplatz. Since the market regulations only permit the sale of goods and not the serving of alcoholic beverages, the so-called \\"Marktfr√ºhst√ºck\\" (market breakfast) takes place on a neighbouring area of Liebfrauenplatz opposite the Haus Zum R√∂mischen Kaiser on Saturdays between spring and autumn as a special public use. The members of the Mainz vintners association serve wine from their own production on a weekly basis. The enjoyment of wine is complemented by the consumption of sausages, cheese and bakery products as well as fruit and vegetables purchased at the neighbouring market stalls. During Advent, the stage programme of the Mainz Christmas Market can be watched on Liebfrauenplatz. At the summit of Mainz carnival, the Rosenmontag procession crosses the square. Other regular events that take place on Liebfrauenplatz include the Intercultural Festival as part of the Intercultural Week and the Johannisnacht.

The UER was chartered in 1919, after the previous operator of the streetcar, the Rhode Island Company, went into temporary receivership. The company was placed under the control of the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission upon inception, in an effort to limit the impact to service in the event of financial difficulties. UER began operations of the consolidated network in 1921, and achieved an all-time high ridership annual of 154 million people in 1923. UER was purchased by the New England Power Company in 1926, and was operated under the UER brand by the Rhode Island Service Company until the system was again reorganized as the United Transit Company in 1951. The transportation system in Rhode Island was deprivatized in 1966 when the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) began operations.  History   Rhode Island Rail Transit before UER (1865 - 1918)  The first iteration of rail-based transit in Rhode Island was the Union Railroad of Providence, a privately-owned horsecar company which began operation in 1865. The first electrified trolleys in the state were introduced in Woonsocket in September 1887. The line was not long enough to be a practical means of transportation, and largely served as an amusement ride. Regular electric trolley service began in August 1889 in Newport, and in January 1892 in Providence. The technology quickly spread to the rest of the existing lines, and sparked the creation of several new railway companies, several of which were not separately owned. In 1894, The United Traction and Electric Company (the Traction Company) was formed as a holding company of the different railways by Marsden Perry, Nelson Aldrich and William Roelker. The Traction Company acquired many of the suburban lines, including those running through Cumberland, Pawtuxet Valley, and Barrington and Warren. By 1902, all lines were electrified. At this point, the Traction Company created the Rhode Island Company (RICo), which subsequently leased the system, still partially operating with the original Union Railroad of Providence name. Due to financial underperformance in its first few years of operations, the stock of RICo was traded frequently, until it was controlled, through a series of intermediaries, by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad by 1907. In addition to providing passenger service, the trolley system also carried trolley freight. The Providence Cable Tramway Company, which operated cable cars up the steep grade of College Hill, was also operated by the RICo series of holding companies at this time. The cable car was rendered obsolete with the 1914 opening of the trolley-accessible East Side Trolley Tunnel, connecting North Main Street to Thayer Street. Antitrust laws passed over the next few years forced the New Haven to pull out of the state, leaving RICo. lacking the financial support of the larger railroad, RICo was unable to pay off debts, At this time, streetcars began seeing increased competition from jitneys and automobiles. The Rhode Island Company continued operations until 1918, when its debt became too burdensome and the Rhode Island Supreme Court terminated its leases.  The United Electric Railways Company (1918 - 1951)  UER was chartered in 1919, as many of the prior streetcar systems were consolidated. These included: * Rhode Island Company lines (except the Providence Danielson Railway Company and the Seaview line) * United Traction and Electric Company ** Union Railroad ** Pawtucket Street Railway ** RI Suburban ** Providence Cable Tramway To prevent future interruption to service for financial reasons, the charter placed the UER under the control of the Public Utilities Commission. The charter was amended on May 5, 1920, stipulating the composition of the board of directors, specifically that two would be appointed by the Governor of Rhode Island and one would be appointed by the Mayor of Providence. The amendment also required the company to pay $1 million for the improvements of its new consolidated system, and set its debt ceiling at $22 million. Measures were proposed to reclassify jitneys as common carriers at this time, but this measure ultimately failed. The unrestricted operation of jitneys rendered several trolley line unprofitable. Tracks first installed in Kennedy Plaza in 1914, then known as Exchange Place, were expanded, forming a major interchange with connections to Union Station by 1920. The UER fully took over operations of the railways in 1921. In 1922, the first trolleybus ran using the trolley's overhead lines. Despite competition from jitneys, the UER saw all-time peak annual ridership of 154 million in 1923. In 1926, the UER was acquired by the New England Power Company. The Rhode Island Service Company then took over UER operations, but the system retained its name and branding. With the arrival of the Great Depression, the system suffered from a lack of improvements and service reductions. Busses were further introduced into the system. Ridership recovered during World War II, due to rations on gasoline, and nearly returned to its 1923 high. By 1948, trolleys had been completely replaced by trolleybuses. Tracks were removed from city streets, and the East Side Trolley Tunnel was reformatted for busses. However, by the early 1950s, ongoing financial difficulties were exacerbated by the commuting public's preference for automobiles over the trolleybuses. As a result, UER was purchased by the United Transit Company (UTC) in 1951, with service was entirely converted by 1952.  The end of Rhode Island Streetcars, replacement of UER, Modern day (mid 1940s - today)  The relaunch of transit in Rhode Island under the UTC garnered an increase in ridership to 100 million annual riders. The further developments of the highway system, however, slowly eroded this slight recovery. By 1955, all electric busses had been replaced with diesel and gasoline vehicles. The Rhode Island General Assembly created the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) in 1964, allowing the state to take control of any system whose imminent failure would harm the public good. This function was fulfilled as RIPTA took over UTC operation on July 1, 1966. All of the tracks and most of the infrastructure associated with the trolley/trolleybus network has since been removed. Several of the former trolleys have been preserved by the Shore Line Trolley Museum. Kennedy Plaza remains a central transit hub, and the East Side Trolley Tunnel continues to be used by RIPTA busses. Some infrastructure for the cable tramway remains under Benefit Street. Many current RIPTA routes mimic those of original interurban network. In 2014, the City of Providence and RIPTA were awarded a $13 million TIGER VI grant for the construction of a streetcar linking Rhode Island Hospital to downtown Providence and College Street via the East Side Trolley Tunnel. However, due to concerns that the such a line would be useful to a relatively small population and a lack of public support, the project was cancelled. In 2016, the grant was approved for reallocation to the construction of RIPTA's Downtown Connector.  Equipment  The UER inherited the rolling stock used by the Rhode Island Company, but also purchased new trolleys and trolleybuses. Rail cars were manufactured by Wason, Laconia, Brill, American Car & Foundry, Newburyport, and Jackson & Sharp, amongst others. Cars were painted green and cream until 1928, at which point the color scheme was changed to yellow and cream. In 1940, 50 cars were sold to Capital Transit. Several of the trolleybuses and busses purchased by the UER were made by Pullman and GMC, which were inherited by the UTC. Some were later taken out of service, and some were converted to diesel. In the early- and mid-1950s, several UER busses were sold to transit agencies in Cleveland, Halifax, Boston, and Winnipeg.

It is an experiment designed with several goals including to determine the pressure and temperature of Plutonian atmosphere, to measurements of a possible ionosphere of Pluto and/or Charon, to record thermal emission temperatures, and to take more accurate chord lengths of Charon and Pluto. To accomplish the objectives, as the spacecraft passes by Pluto, it is targeted on a path that takes it behind the dwarf planet in relation to where Earth is, and at that time radio signals from the flyby spacecraft pass through atmosphere of body, and from this various aspects can be determined. REX also is designed to take measurements of the atmospheric conditions at Pluto's moon Charon as part of the mission. REX utilizes an ultrastable oscillator, various electronics, and radio hardware aboard the New Horizons spacecraft. REX utilizes the X-band radio uplink on the spacecraft. REX hardware weights 160 g (0.16 kg) and consumes 1.6 watts of spacecraft electrical power. It also makes use of other NH hardware, overall key hardware components for REX include: * high-gain antenna * low-noise X-band receiver * ultrastable oscillator To take the measurements, REX communicates with the Deep Space Network back on Earth. REX can also directly measure the thermal radiation of Pluto at 4.2 cm wavelength. Observation goals: *temperature profiles of Pluto's atmosphere *pressure profiles of Pluto's atmosphere *radiometric temperature *gravitational moments *ionosphere structure Extended mission REX is also planned for use in the New Horizon's post Pluto extended mission, including the 486958 Arrokoth flyby. REX will be used to take thermal measurements of the Kuiper belt body during the planned flyby. REX is also used to study the amount of electrons in outer space in the Kuiper belt region. The Kuiper belt is a ring of orbiting bodies between approximately 30 to 55 AU (Earth-Sun distances), home to Pluto and short-period comets it is estimated to consist of hundreds of thousand if not millions of small icy objects. The belt was discovered starting in 1992, and can be studied more closely by the New Horizons mission which is passing through it starting in the late 2010s. During the post Pluto cruise, REX is usually turned on monthly to measure the electron density of the solar wind between Earth and the spacecraft. When New Horizons flew by Pluto in 2015, it was at about 32.9 AU from the Sun, and about 43.6 AU for the New Year's Day 2019 flyby of Arrokoth. The timing of the Arrokoth flyby was adjusted in part to aid the use of the REX experiment, in particular time it so more radar dishes on Earth could be used for this experiment. Data from REX Using REX radio occultation data the diameter of Pluto was found to be in a 2017 paper.

Thakur contested the 2019 Indian general election from Bhopal constituency, running against Digvijaya Singh of the Indian National Congress, the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. She won her debut contest by a margin of votes., EconomicTimes, 23 May 2019. According to political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot, she has become the \\"symbol\\" of the 2019 election, in which nebulous fringe elements of the Hindutva ideology have been mainstreamised.Election results invite questions for liberals. Worldwide, they lack their rivals‚Äô discipline, The Indian Express, 24 May 2019. On 21 November 2019 Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has been made a part of the 21-member parliamentary consultative committee on defence, which is headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. After her comment in parliament, where she called Nathuram Godse (Gandhi's assassin) a patriot, she was criticised by opposition party members. On 28 November, she was sacked from the committee on defence as well as BJP parliamentary party meetings. Personal life Thakur was born on 2 February 1970. Her father, Chandrapal Singh, was an Ayurvedic practitioner in Bhind, Madhya Pradesh and a worker of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. She had been a tomboy since her childhood, keeping short hair, and dressing like a boy. She was often called 'the girl with boyish looks'. She loved riding bikes. It was a motorcycle registered on her name which led to her arrest in connection with the Malegaon blasts.  Cancer treatment  Cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon Dr. S. S. Rajput of the Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow said that Thakur underwent a bilateral mastectomy to prevent recurrence of her cancer in 2008, stating he had operated on her three times. She had been operated twice to surgically remove both her breast to cure her breast cancer. She was criticised for saying that her breast cancer got cured because of using cow urine and Panchagavya. Political career  Thakur studied at Lahar College (Bhind), where, in 1993, she joined Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Sangh Parivar. She subsequently rose to the position of state secretary and left this organisation in 1997. After that, she worked for Rashtrawadi Sena and the Hindu Jagran Manch. She was also a member of Durga Vahini, women's wing of Hindu organisation Bajrang Dal. She is also a founder member of Vande Mataram Jan Kalyan Samiti, which is an organisation connected to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and belongs to the Sangh Parivar. 2019 General Elections Thakur joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on 17 April 2019 and was declared as the BJP candidate for Bhopal Lok Sabha constituency for 2019 elections. Thakur was in the news for saying that Mumbai former ATS chief Hemant Karkare died in 2008 Mumbai attacks because she cursed him for giving her bad treatment in jail after her arrest in 2008 blasts. BJP leader Fatima Rasool Siddique said her communal and obnoxious remarks have tarnished the image of Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Muslims and she will not campaign for Thakur. Election Commission of India directed the police to file an FIR against Thakur for her Babri Masjid remark that she participated in demolition of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya in 1992. The Election Commission later banned her for 72 hours from campaigning for violating the Model Code of Conduct by stirring up communal feelings. She was later criticised by BJP party leaders for saying that the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, Nathuram Godse was and always will be a patriot. Nevertheless, Thakur won the election by a margin of votes defeating opposing candidate Digvijaya Singh, a two-time Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. According to political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot, she has become the \\"symbol\\" of the 2019 election, in which nebulous fringe elements of the Hindutva ideology have been mainstreamised. Parliamentary committee on defence On 21 November 2019 Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has been made a part of the 21-member parliamentary consultative committee on defence, which is headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. After her comment in parliament, where she called Nathuram Godse (Gandhi's assassin) a patriot, she was criticised by opposition party members. On 28 November, she was sacked from the committee on defence as well as BJP parliamentary party meetings. 2008 Malegaon bombings Following the 2008 Malegaon bombings, in which six people were killed and over 100 injured, Thakur was arrested as one of the prime accused in October 2008 under terrorism charges. Arrest and trial Mumbai's Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) claimed that Thakur formed a group to take revenge for the 2006 Mumbai train bombings and that her motorcycle was used in the bomb blast. This motorcycle was a key evidence in the arrest of Thakur. On 19 January 2009, Maharashtra Police filed a 4000-page charge sheet for the Malegaon blasts. According to this charge sheet, Lt Col Prasad Purohit was claimed to be the main conspirator who provided the explosives and Thakur arranged the persons who planted the explosive. It was claimed that on 11 April 2008, Thakur and Purohit met in Bhopal wherein both agreed for co- operation in carrying out the blast. However, the charges framed against the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act were dropped for Thakur in July 2009 because Thakur was not proven to be a member of this organised crime syndicate.Malegaon case: MCOCA charge against Sadhvi, Purohit dropped Rediff - 31 July 2009 Swami Aseemanand in his on-camera confessions named Thakur as one of the key conspirators in the 2008 Malegaon, Ajmer Dargah, and Samjhauta Express terror blasts. Bail pleas Thakur had challenged the Bombay High court order of 12 March 2010 rejecting her plea for bail, contending that her arrest violated the mandate of Article 22(1) and 22(2) of the Constitution and also on the ground that no charge sheet was filed within 90 days as contemplated by Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. She contended that she was arrested by the Maharashtra Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) from Surat on 10 October 2008, but was brought before the magistrate on 24 October, and thus was in illegal detention for 14 days which violated Article 22(2). On 23 September 2011, the Supreme Court dismissed the bail plea. Dismissing her plea, the bench of Justice JM Panchal and Justice HL Gokhale said \\"The appellant's contention that she was arrested on October 10, 2008, and was in police custody since then is found to be factually incorrect by this Court. The appellant was arrested only on October 23, 2008, and within 24 hours thereof, on October 24, 2008, she was produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nasik. As such, there is no violation of either Article 22(2) of the Constitution or Section 167 of Cr.PC.\\" In 2012 she also filed an application for bail in the Bombay High Court on health grounds, claiming that she has been diagnosed with third-stage breast cancer. On 9 August 2012, she, however, withdrew her application. In 2014 she again filed an application for bail in the Bombay High Court which was rejected. In April 2017, she was granted bail by the Bombay High Court on health grounds, following the dropping of charges in under the MCOCA section by the Special National Investigation Agency. She is currently under trial for multiple charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.  Allegations of torture  Thakur has made, directly or indirectly, several claims about ill-treatment in prison. In August 2014, the Human Rights Commission ordered a probe into Thakur's allegations of torture while in police custody. Subsequently, the case of torture was closed as the panel did not find any evidence to support these claims.  Controversies  Thakur caused stir in July 2020 after statements claiming that reciting a devotional hymn known as Hanuman Chalisa would help eradicate COVID-19.

Plot Following a party, Sherry Gillespie (Al Wilson), a U. S. Mail flyer, awakes to find himself in a strange apartment and is shown evidence by Cleo Roberts (Carmelita Geraghty) that they were married the previous evening. Bart Sheldon (Harry von Meter), the leader of a gang, plots with a henchman to fly Sherry's aircraft and cautions Cleo not to let the pilot escape. When Sherry escapes, however, and returns to the flying field, he is suspended by his employer. His estranged fianc√©e Alice ()Kathleen Myers is heartbroken when learning about Cleo, who is scheming with Sheldon to obtain part of an inheritance that Sherry is to receive if he earns $10,000 in a year. Following a series of fast complications, Sherry decides to clear his name. He tracks down the gang, and swinging from a motorcycle to a rope ladder, he mounts the villain's aircraft wing and fights hand-to-hand with Sheldon. He and Sheldon parachute to the ground.

Reception Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo, in Aviation in the Cinema (1985) said The Flying Mail was only one of a long list of aviation films that showcased Wilson's talents. He alternately wrote, acted and flew in a career that \\"spanned more than 10 years, and he acted in more films than any other professional pilot.\\" Pendo 1985, pp. 7‚Äì8, 11. In The Flying Mail , Pendo noted the aerial stunts featured Wilson who \\"jumped from a motorcycle to a ladder suspended from a plane, fought a hand-to-hand battle on the plane's wing, and made a two-man, one- parachute drop ‚Äì all, as a title in the film clearly stated, with no double or trick photography.\\" Pendo 1985, p. 62.

History The M1877 was first designed and produced by the Obukhov State Plant in Saint Petersburg and was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns with similar roles such as the French Mortier de 270 mm mod√®le 1889 or the US 12-inch coast defense mortar. Design The M1877 was a short barreled breech-loading mortar. The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with reinforcing hoops which was built from cast iron and steel. The mortar had an early form of Krupp horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. There were also two other similar and mortars that were also designed in 1877. Coastal Defense In the coastal defense role, the M1877's theory of operation was that a low- velocity mortar firing a large shell at a high-angle was more likely to destroy an enemy ship by penetrating its thin deck armor than a high-velocity low-angle naval gun attempting to penetrate its thicker belt armor. The downside was that high-angle indirect fire was harder to aim correctly so more mortars would be needed to defend an area from attack. However, if the area was constrained by geography like a port at the mouth of a river the navigation channels could be measured ahead of time and firing ranges calculated. A complicating factor was as naval artillery progressed their size and range soon eclipsed the mortar's range. In the coastal defense role, the M1877 was mounted on a garrison mount which sat on a concrete slab behind a parapet. The mount consisted of a rectangular steel firing platform with a pivot at the front and two wheels at the rear to give 360¬∞ of traverse. The recoil system for the M1877 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffer at the front slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. These garrison mounts were used in both the coastal defense and fortress gun roles. Fortress Gun In addition to its coastal defense role, the M1877 was also used as a fortress gun on the same type of mounts as in the coastal role. The M1877's were not designed to be mobile and it would have needed to be disassembled, moved on site and then reassembled before use. Due to a string of Russian defeats in the first two years of the war, it is possible the Germans may have captured a number of them but what use they made of them is unknown. However, the Germans did make use of captured 8-inch M1877 mortars and 11-inch M1877 guns on the Western Front.

Eloy Menoyo, leader and co-founder of the Second National Front of Escambray Second National Front of Escambray was an independent guerilla group led by Eloy Guti√©rrez Menoyo and Dr. Armando Fleites and included Roger Redondo, Ramiro Lorenzo, Jorge Castell√≥n, Jes√∫s Carreras Saya, L√°zaro Artola, Genaro Arroyo, and others in the Cuban central Escambray Mountains. William Alexander Morgan was also a part of the Escambray group. While initially the group supported Fidel Castro in his efforts to overthrow Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, after Castro took power some of its members joined former Batista soldiers and local farmers in the Escambray Rebellion (1959-1965) opposing Castro. History  Anti-Bautista Military Action (1957-1959)  The rebel group fought against president Batista‚Ä≤s rule. The Second Front was a splinter group from the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) (English: Student Revolutionary Directorate) responsible for the coordinated attack on March 13, 1957 on Batista's Presidential Palace organized by DRE leader Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a, who died the same day in a related incident. Some important members of the Second National Front of Escambray were Max Lesnik and L√°zaro Artola. The DRE's \\"Escambray Manifesto\\" of February 24, 1958 envisaged simultaneous urban and rural guerrilla warfare against Batista. It called for the restoration of the Constitution of 1940, and for social revolution, while attacking \\"those who only a few years ago supported the Nazis in the conquered lands of Europe,\\" a direct reference to the Communists. As the manifesto circulated throughout the island, the Escambray guerrillas gained strength. Eloy Guti√©rrez Menoyo and the National Front of Escambray were the first group to march into Havana on January 3, 1959 as Castro and the 26th of July Movement arrived a few days later on January 8, 1959. After the success of the Revolution the National Front of Escambray was absorbed by Castro's army and many leaders of the movement were considered to be Heroes of the Rebellion. Despite the success National Front members such as Menoyo, were not included or offered jobs in Castro's government. These tensions quickly escalated to a resurrection of the National Front Movement in the form of the Second National Front of Escambray in September 1959.  Early Anti-Castro Years and U.S. Support (1959-1961)  Upon establishing an anti-Castro movement Menoyo retreated back to the Escambray Mountains, the base of the last revolution. The movement became popular among farmers who did not support the collectivization enforced by the Castro government thus leading to the movement leading targeted attacks on agricultural hubs and field burnings. The act of raiding and crop burning is what gave the conflict the name of the \\"War Against the Bandits\\" among native Cubans. It was through these actions that the movement engaged the Castro regime as it was not strong enough to engage in a direct conflict revolution. After Fidel Castro announced his ties to the Soviet Union, the United States began to support the National Front in order to oppose the spread of Communism to the western hemisphere. One of the leading figures in acquiring American aid for the revolution was William Alexander Morgan, an American who had fought in the revolution and joined the anti-Castro movement. Morgan was a former member of the U.S. Army and acted as the main point of communication between the American government and the Escambray movement. Morgan moved into the position of Commander in the movement as he was favored by the U.S. as strong opposition to Castro and potential transition leader of the people. However, upon Morgan's capture and execution in March 1961 the movement was dealt its first major defeat. Before Morgan's capture and death, the United States was in close contact with the National Front formulating a plan to attack the Castro regime directly and restore an anti-communist government. This plan was constructed in coordination with the Eisenhower administration during the American President's second term, but the planning took place too close to the end of Eisenhower's term and would have to postponed until the next President took office. With the election of John F. Kennedy it was expected that the operation would be put on hold in order for the new administration to be informed of the situation. In January 1961 Menoyo took a small group of Front members and traveled to Florida to form Alpha 66 an elite division of Cuban fighters to participate in the planned operation known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion. However, the Kennedy Administration greenlighted the operation for April 17, 1961 and Alpha 66 was unable to deploy. The invasion was unsuccessful as the Cuban fighters were outgunned causing the United States to call off the attack. After the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion U.S. support began to dwindle as the movement was handed its second major defeat in a matter of months.  Late Years and Defeat (1962-1964)  Following a series of tactical defeats, the National Front persisted in operation despite losing two leaders. Menoyo remained in Florida with the Alpha 66 and a small collection of leaders maintain organized strikes on farms and industrial outskirts. This period prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, saw a stagnation of movement operations as strikes became more routinized. This stagnation was due to the series of defeats the movement suffered in 1961, thus preventing the group from engaging in any major operations with support from the U.S. as communications with the Americans decreased after the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis one of the conditions of peace between the United States and Soviet Union was for the United States to cut all aid to Cuban insurgencies. This meant that the Second National Front of Escambray would no longer have American support of any kind. The absence of American aid meant that munitions and medical supplies would no longer be provided thus further prohibiting the movement from any major conflict as they would not be able to treat the injured. The final defeat of the movement came in 1964 when Menoyo returned from Florida in December 1964, to mount a coastal assault in northern Cuba. The result was Menoyo being captured by the Castro Regime and the leadership of the movement surrendering formally to the regime. This marked the end of the Second National Front of Escambray.

She was employed by the United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries from 1918 to 1921, working as lab assistant for Charles Henry Gilbert. She worked for the California Division of Fish and Game from 1921 to 1923. She earned a MS in 1924 and a PhD in 1925 from the University of Michigan. From 1925 to 1926, she taught at San Jose Junior High School. From 1926 to 1941, she worked for the California Department of Fish and Game as an assistant biologist and then researcher. From 1941, she was director of the California State Fisheries Laboratory on Terminal Island, retiring to La Jolla in 1956. Her research mainly focused on the Pacific sardine. Besides working in California, she also conducted research studies in Peru and New Zealand. Clark's studies of sardine populations off the California coast during the 1930s led her to believe that, without better yield management in the sardine fishery, depletion of the sardine population was inevitable. Calls for restraint from Clark and other scientists were ignored and the collapse of the fishery and the associated canning industry followed. She later played an important role in establishing California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) and continued to be involved with that organization after her retirement.

By the mid-1870s, it hauled about 3,000,000 barrels of oil annually, of which about two-thirds came from independent oil refiners. The company was a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad and it was very profitable. In 1876 the company paid a 10 percent dividend ($400,000) on stock worth $4,000,000. Venture into oil refining and sale to the combine Many of Potts' oil tanker customers were independent refiners, and he became worried that his business would become subservient to Standard Oil. In 1877, Potts bought an oil refinery on Long Island and began to build one in Philadelphia. John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil visited with Thomas A. Scott, the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad to object having a competitor in the refining business, even though Scott knew that Standard Oil owned at least twice as many tank cars that the Empire Transportation Company owned. Following this meeting, Standard Oil shut down its Pittsburgh refineries in March 1877, depriving the Pennsylvania Railroad of 65 percent of its oil traffic. A strike in July 1877 destroyed millions of dollars of Pennsylvania Railroad property. In discussions that largely excluded Potts, A.J. Cassatt of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Standard Oil agreed to a sale price of $3,500,000 in October 1877.

The town was defended by an Anglo-Gascon army under Ralph, Earl of Stafford. In 1345 Henry, Earl of Lancaster, was sent to Gascony in south west France with 2,000 men and large financial resources. In 1346 the French focused their effort on the south west and, early in the campaigning season, an army of 15,000‚Äì20,000 men marched down the valley of the Garonne. Aiguillon commands both the Rivers Garonne and Lot, and it was not possible to sustain an offensive further into Gascony unless the town was taken. Duke John, the son and heir apparent of Philip VI, laid siege to the town. The garrison, some 900 men, sortied repeatedly to interrupt the French operations, while Lancaster concentrated the main Anglo-Gascon force at La R√©ole, some away, as a threat. Duke John was never able to fully blockade the town, and found that his own supply lines were seriously harassed. On one occasion Lancaster used his main force to escort a large supply train into the town. In July the main English army landed in northern France and moved towards Paris. Philip VI repeatedly ordered his son, Duke John, to break off the siege and bring his army north. Duke John, considering it a matter of honour, refused. By August, the French supply system had broken down, there was a dysentery epidemic in their camp, desertion was rife and Philip VI's orders were becoming imperious. On 20 August the French abandoned the siege and their camp and marched away. Six days later the main French army was decisively beaten in the Battle of Cr√©cy with very heavy losses. Two weeks after this defeat, Duke John's army joined the French survivors. Background left|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=A map of French territory as it was in 1340, showing the enclave of Gascony in the south west|France in 1330. Since the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. Over the centuries, English holdings in France had varied in size, but by 1337 only Gascony in south western France and Ponthieu in northern France were left. The independent minded Gascons had their own customs and claimed to have a separate language. They preferred their relationship with a distant English king who left them alone to one with a French king who would interfere in their affairs. Following a series of disagreements between Philip VI of France and Edward III of England, on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council in Paris agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last one hundred and sixteen years. Gascony Before the war commenced well over 1,000 ships a year departed Gascony. Among their cargoes were over of locally produced wine. The duty collected by the English Crown on wine from Bordeaux exceeded all other customs duties combined and was by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, had a population of over 50,000, greater than London's, and Bordeaux was possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this. Although Gascony was the cause of the war, Edward was able to spare few resources for it and whenever an English army campaigned on the continent it had operated in northern France. In most campaigning seasons the Gascons had had to rely on their own resources and had been hard-pressed by the French. In 1339, the French besieged Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, even breaking into the city with a large force before they were repulsed. Typically the Gascons could field 3,000‚Äì6,000 men, the large majority infantry, although up to two-thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons. The border between English and French territory in Gascony was extremely unclear, to the extent that the idea of a \\"border\\" is anachronistic. Many landholders owned a patchwork of widely separated estates, perhaps owing fealty to a different overlord for each. Each small estate was likely to have a fortified tower or keep, and larger estates had castles. Fortifications were also constructed at transport choke points, to collect tolls and to restrict military passage; fortified towns grew up alongside all bridges and most fords over the many rivers in the region. Military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on at frequent intervals. If they wished to remain in one place for any length of time, as was necessary to besiege a castle, then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder and desirable for such items as siege equipment. Warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points, and for the mutable loyalty of the local nobility; the region had been in a state of flux for centuries and many local lords served whichever country was stronger, regardless of national ties. By 1345, after eight years of war, English-controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from Bordeaux to Bayonne, with isolated strongholds further inland. During 1345, Henry, Duke of Lancaster,During the 1345 campaign he was known as the Earl of Derby, but his father died in September 1345 and he became the Earl of Lancaster. had led a whirlwind campaign at the head of an Anglo- Gascon army. He had smashed two large French armies at the battles of Bergerac and Auberoche, captured French towns and fortifications in much of P√©rigord and most of Agenais and given the English possessions in Gascony strategic depth. During the winter following this successful campaign Lancaster's second in command, Ralph, Earl of Stafford, had marched on the vitally important town of Aiguillon, which commanded the junction of the Rivers Garonne and Lot. The town's inhabitants had attacked the garrison and opened the gates to the English. Prelude John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir apparent of Philip VI, was placed in charge of all French forces in south west France, as he had been the previous autumn. He assembled at Orl√©ans the largest army the French had yet fielded in the south west. It was supported by every military officer of the royal household. As always, money was short. In spite of borrowing over 330,000 florins (¬£ in terms) from the Pope, Duke John had to issue orders to local officials to: \\"Amass all of the money you can for the support of our wars. Take it from each and every person you can...\\" It was a clear indication of the desperate state of the French finances. A second army was formed at Toulouse, based on contingents from the Languedoc; it included a siege train and five cannon. Duke John planned to march on and besiege the large, strongly fortified town of La R√©ole on the north bank of the Garonne river, only from Bordeaux, which Lancaster had captured the previous year. Aiguillon commanded both the Lot and the Garonne and its possession was essential to supply any army around La R√©ole. Lancaster understood that no French offensive could have a permanent effect so long as Aiguillon, described by the modern historian Kenneth Fowler as \\"the key to the Gascon plain\\", was held, so he garrisoned it very strongly: 300 men-at-arms and 600 archers commanded by Stafford. The town was well stocked with supplies and materiel, although the physical defences were in a poor state. The main wall, long, was modern but incomplete ‚Äì gaps were filled with improvised defences. A bridge over the River Lot was fortified and had a barbican gate, but it was centuries old and poorly maintained. There were two small forts within the town, both overlooking the Garonne. The northern wall of the town was protected by the Lot and the western by the Garonne, while the southern and eastern walls were more easily approached. Lancaster based himself in La R√©ole, on the Garonne downstream, throughout the siege. Siege Investment Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford The French armies assembled and marched unusually early in the campaigning season. By March they were both in the province of Quercy. The size of the French forces at this point is not recorded, but it has been estimated that later in the campaign they numbered between 15,000 and 20,000; modern historians have described the French army as a \\"huge force\\" and as \\"enormously superior\\" to any force the Anglo-Gascons could field. The army marched down the valley of the Garonne from Agen, reaching Aiguillon on 1 April. On 2 April the arri√®re-ban, the formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for the south of France. Isolating the town presented a problem for the French. The junction of the two rivers created three different areas, each of which would need to be interdicted. But separating their army into three divisions was inviting defeat in detail. They needed to be able to rapidly combine their forces if one part was threatened. A bridge over the Lot, from Aiguillon, was easily taken, but it was necessary to construct a new bridge over the Garonne. Duke John employed over 300 carpenters in its construction, escorted by 1,400 crossbowmen and an unknown but significant number of men-at-arms. The garrison sortied repeatedly against this work, sometimes several times a day. They twice broke it up, but it was completed by the end of May. The three parts of the French army each dug impressive earthworks, to protect themselves both from sorties by the garrison and from Lancaster's main army. Operations A derelict section of Aiguillon's walls, pictured in 1855 As was normal, within a matter of days the large French army had swept the surrounding area clear of supplies and was entirely dependent on the rivers for its logistics. The Anglo-Gascon army based in La R√©ole harassed the French foragers, intercepted their supplies and kept them in a constant state of alarm. Dysentery soon broke out in the French camps. In mid-June the French attempted to pass two large supply barges down the Lot to their contingent west of the Garonne. They needed to pass under the fortified bridge held by the garrison. The garrison sortied from the bridge's barbican, through the French lines, and captured the barges; bringing them into the town. Fierce fighting broke out as the sortie party attempted to retreat to the barbican, which after several hours was lost to the French. The garrison closed the gates and secured the town at the cost of trapping most of this party outside; the survivors were taken prisoner. The French were unable to effectively isolate the town. Throughout the siege the Anglo-Gascons were able to run the blockade at will with small quantities of supplies and reinforcements. In July a larger force fought its way through with a greater quantity of supplies. From the start of the siege the French had concentrated their efforts against the southern side of the defences. At least twelve large siege engines, probably trebuchets, carried out a round-the-clock area bombardment. The results were considered unsatisfactory. In July an attack was attempted from the north, across the Lot, using three siege towers mounted on large barges. As they were being manoeuvred across the river one was hit by a missile from an English trebuchet, capsizing it with heavy loss. The attack was abandoned. The siege became an end in itself for Duke John. Having laid siege to Aiguillon it was a matter of knightly honour not to retreat before it fell. At one point he solemnly vowed not to abandon the siege until he had occupied the town. By July the French were drawing supplies from over away, a distance barely sustainable with 14th-century overland transportation. In early 1346 the English captured the castle of Bajamont, from Agen, the capital of Agenais, on the Garonne. This was one of several strongholds from which the English carried out raids on the French lines of communication. In late July a French force of 2,000 men marched against it. The small English garrison under Galhart de Durfort attacked the French, defeated them, and captured their commander, Robert de Houdetot, the Seneschal of the Agenais. The French army began to starve; horses died for lack of fodder; the dysentery epidemic worsened; cases of desertion, increasingly to the English, mounted. French withdrawal In 1345 Edward III had sent expeditionary forces to Gascony and Brittany and had assembled his main army for action in northern France or Flanders. It had sailed but never landed, after the fleet was scattered in a storm. Knowledge of Edward III's intent had kept French focus on the north until late in the campaigning season. In 1346 Edward III again gathered a large army, and the French once again became aware of this. The French assumed that Edward would sail for Gascony, where Lancaster was heavily outnumbered. To guard against any possibility of an English landing in northern France, Philip VI relied on his powerful navy. This reliance was misplaced given the naval technology of the time and on 12 July an English army of 7,000‚Äì10,000 landed near Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue in north west Normandy. This force pillaged its way across the richest parts of France, capturing and sacking every town in its path. The English fleet paralleled its march, devastating everything up to five miles inland and destroying most of the French navy in its ports. Philip VI recalled his main army, under Duke John, from Gascony. After a furious argument with his advisers, and according to some accounts his father's messenger, Duke John refused to move until his honour was satisfied. On 29 July Philip VI called an arri√®re-ban for northern France at Rouen. On 7 August the English reached the Seine. Philip VI sent orders to Duke John insisting that he abandon the siege of Aiguillon and march his army north. Edward III marched south east and on 12 August his army was from Paris. On 14 August, Duke John attempted to arrange a local truce. Lancaster, well aware of the situation in the north and in the French camps around Aiguillon, refused. On 20 August, after over five months, the French abandoned the siege and marched away in considerable haste and disorder. The French camps were left under the guard of local levies, who promptly deserted. The entire equipment of the French army was captured: supplies, materiel, siege engines and many horses. In at least the early stages of their retreat, discipline amongst the French was poor; there are accounts of men being jostled off the bridge over the Garonne and drowned. Stafford's garrison and other local Anglo-Gascon forces pursued closely. Part of Duke John's personal baggage was captured. French castles and minor fortifications along the Lot upstream from Aiguillon were mopped up, as were French positions between the Lot and the Dordogne. Aftermath Duke John and his army made contact with Philip VI on, or shortly after, 7 September, two weeks after the French army of the north, 20,000‚Äì25,000 strong, had been decisively beaten at the Battle of Cr√©cy with very heavy losses. After Cr√©cy the French stripped their garrisons in the south west to build-up a new army to face the main English threat in the north east. The areas facing Lancaster were effectively defenceless. He launched three separate offensives between September and November. Local Gascon forces besieged the few major strongholds in the Bazadais region still held by the French; they were all taken, including the town of Bazas. Further Gascon forces raided to the east, deep into Quercy, penetrating over ; the modern historian Jonathan Sumption describes this as \\"dislocating the royal administration in central and southern France for three months\\". Meanwhile, Lancaster himself took a small force, 1,000 men-at-arms and an unknown number of archers (possibly 1,000), to the north on a grand chevauch√©e, a great mounted raid, during which he captured the rich provincial capital of Poitiers, and many towns and castles throughout Saintonge and Aunis. With these offensives, Lancaster moved the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to 50 miles or more beyond its borders.

Early years Mann played kicker and punter at Cy-Fair High School in Cypress, Texas, under the tutelage of head coach Ed Pustejovsky, a former Texas A&M; football player. As a junior, Mann scored 7-of-10 field goals (with a long of 49 yards) and 46-of-48 extra points. He was named to the 2014 Houston Chronicle All- Greater Houston team. As a senior, he scored 25-of-25 extra points and recorded a 45-yard punting average on 41 punts. Following his senior season, Mann played in the Under Armour All-America Game. Though Mann wanted to play linebacker in high school and college, he was not able to do so due to his size and injuries. As a college football recruit, he was rated nationally as the number two kicker by Rivals.com and the number five kicker by 247Sports.com. College career Mann was primarily the kickoff specialist during his first two years at Texas A&M.; During his freshman season, he averaged 63.9 yards on 76 kickoffs, and as a sophomore, he averaged 62.4 yards on 73 kickoffs. He was not the starting punter during his freshman year and only punted the ball twice during the season (two punts for 94 yards, or a 47.0 average). As a sophomore, he did not punt at all and made only one kicking attempt. During the 2017 season-opening 44‚Äì45 loss to UCLA, he missed a 43-yard field goal. Following the graduation of veteran punter Shane Tripucka, Mann became the starting punter during the 2018 season, and made an immediate impact on the team. During the Alabama game, he broke the NCAA football bowl subdivision single-game record with a 60.8 punting average. The previous record of 60.4 was set in 1983 and matched in 2010. During the Kentucky game, he recorded an 82-yard punt, which in Texas A&M; punt history was the third-longest and longest since 1944. After the first six games, in October 2018, Mann received midseason All-America honors from the Associated Press, Athlon Sports, Sporting News, Sports Illustrated, CBS Sports, USA Today, and ESPN. He also received praise from former NFL punter and pro bowler Pat McAfee. Mann continued to receive recognition for the remainder of his junior season. During the November 2018 game against University of Alabama at Birmingham, he made his 14th punt of 60 or more yards breaking the NCAA FBS single-season record set in 2005 by former Wake Forest punter Ryan Plackemeier. Following the regular season, Mann received first-team all-SEC honors from the league's coaches and the Associated Press and was also named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Year. He picked up first team All-America honors from the Associated Press (AP), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Athlon Sports, CBS Sports, ESPN, Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Sporting News, Sports Illustrated, Bleacher Report, College Football News, USA Today, and Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF). Since he earned All-America honors from all five NCAA-recognized selectors (AP, AFCA, FWAA, Sporting News, and WCFF), he became the 10th unanimous All-American from Texas A&M.; He also won the Ray Guy Award as the nation's top collegiate punter. Mann led the nation with his season punting average of 50.98 yards per punt. He broke the single-season punting average record of 50.28 set in 1997 by former LSU punter Chad Kessler.

Career  Delvon Lamarr Organ Trio was founded in 2015 and originally consisted of keyboardist Delvon Lamarr (Dumas) on Hammond B-3, guitarist Colin Higgins and drummer David McGraw. Soon after guitarist Jimmy James (Williams) replaced Higgins. All members had been active instrumentalists in the Seattle music scene. With the help of Lamarr's wife, Amy Novo, acting as manager and booking agent, the group was solidified. Originally a drummer and trumpet player, Lamarr switched to organ at age twenty-two. He said he picked up the instrument naturally by observing organist/keyboardist Joe Doria. James and McGraw had previously co-founded 'The True Loves', a Seattle-based 9-piece soul band. The band has toured in the United States and abroad and has performed in several music festivals including the Detroit and the Monterey Jazz Festivals. The trio's debut album Close But No Cigar was originally released in 2016 (on CD), and was re- released in March 2018 (on both LP and CD) by Colemine Records. The album reached number one on the U.S. Contemporary Jazz Albums chart and number three on the U.S. Jazz Albums chart. In April 2018, the band released a live album titled Live at KEXP!

In late 2018, drummer Doug Octa Port replaced McGraw. Drummer Michael Duffy joined the band for their 2019 European Tour. Style The band's music is rhythm-based and rooted in the 1960s and 1970s soul-jazz, funk and blues styles, reminiscent of Booker T. & the M.G.'s. The songs are typically developed by improvisation over organ grooves. Bandleader Lamarr described it as \\"soul music with a strong jazz influence\\".

It was directed by Paul Ferrara, Babe Hill and The Doors. Ferrara followed the Doors between April and September 1968, filming excerpts of concert performances, conversations between the band and the band relaxing backstage. Hill recorded the audio using a portable Nagra recorder. The documentary was never officially completed, although it was shown at film festivals. A restored version was released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2014. Cast Production Filming using 16mm cameras took place during the band‚Äôs 1968 summer tour. Although all of the band's Hollywood Bowl appearance in July 1968 was recorded, few other songs by the Doors were recorded in their entirety. Towards the end of the summer of 1968, the band reviewed the expenditure on the film and halted any further recording. Frank Lisciandro (who had attended film school at UCLA with Morrison and Manzarek) undertook to create a first cut of the film. The band would then decide whether to continue. However, another event was to have a major impact on the project. At a March 1969 concert in Miami, Morrison was arrested after allegedly exposing himself onstage. The film was then cancelled. Bruce Botnick, the band‚Äôs long- time engineer/co-producer and Anna Coker restored the soundtrack for the 2014 release.

Moody Blvd., Bunnell, Florida, was built in 1918 by Samuel Merwin Bortree (1859-1918) as a wedding gift for his daughter Ethel Lura Bortree Holden (1892-1977), and her husband Thomas Edward Holden (1892-1974). It is an excellent example of the Craftsman Bungalow architectural style. The house was purchased by Flagler County for $40,000 on August 6, 1979 from a Holden family member. It is now a museum that features artifacts from Flagler County and the general Florida area dating from the St. Johns Culture (500 BCE) to the present. It is also the headquarters for the Flagler County Historical Society.Jaye, Randy. The Holden House Centennial (1918-2018). Flagler County Historical Society, (2018). The house's upstairs bathroom was one of the first indoor bathrooms in the Bunnell area and features unique small hexagon tiles on the floor which were similar to the flooring design used in the original owner's pharmacy building (Holden's Pharmacy) which is no longer extant and was located at the southwest corner of the intersection of Moody Boulevard and U.S. 1 in Bunnell.The Pioneers of Bunnell. Pictoral History of Bunnell, FL. Flagler County Historical Society, (1988). The Holden House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 16, 2018 (Reference Number: SG100003020). Holden House History and Architectural Attributes The style of the Holden House is Craftsman Bungalow which was a popular architectural design in the United States from around 1900 to the mid-1930s. Craftsman Bungalow style houses are known for their many fine details and excellent workmanship. The style was influenced by earlier homes that were built by British colonists in India. This house style, which includes the Holden House, is defined by features that include wood construction, a low-pitched gabled roof with broad eaves, large front porches, practical floor plans, plastered ceilings, a fireplace and casement windows.Winter, Robert. American Bungalow Style. Simon & Schuster, (1996). A unique feature on the Holden House was the use of colorful pieces of apothecary bottles (glass mosaic) that were inset in the front gable. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew knocked the glass mosaic off of the gable of the front dormer. Early in 2019, white aluminum siding was installed on the gable of the front dormer to replace the glass mosaic. When the sun porch was added, sometime in the 1930s, the gable was inset with an array of multi-colored antique glass, broken dishes and at least one automobile tail light in an attempt to make it look similar to the front gable's original design.Jaye, Randy. Flagler County, Florida: A Centennial History. Booklocker.com, (2017). The Holden House, now more than 100 years old, is mostly in original condition. The locally quarried coquina rock along the front porch is original. The sash windows are replacements. The chimney on the southwest side of the house was replaced a few years ago because roofers performing repairs accidentally knocked some of it down. The fireplace in the living room originally contained a kerosene stove that heated the house during the winter. The Holden's had residential air conditioning and heating installed in the house in the 1950s. The wood trim and most of the interior doors are original to the house as is the plate rail in the dining room. The kitchen sink and appliances have all been replaced but the wood cabinets are original. The breakthrough between the kitchen and dining room is original and was used for family gatherings and social events. Some of the downstairs pine wood flooring was damaged by termites and had to be removed. It was replaced by removing and installing the same undamaged wood flooring from closets on the second floor. The downstairs bathroom was added years after the house was built. A prominent feature of the second floor is an outside screened porch that is accessed through the master bedroom. In 1988, a $57,000 historical grant from the State of Florida was awarded and a portion was used for a major renovation of the house. This is one of the main reasons the house is now in excellent cosmetic and structural condition. In 2010, more than $23,000 was invested in additional repairs that included the replacement of damaged exterior wood siding and trim, exterior painting (which restored the house's exterior to its original color: white with green trim), installation of a metal hand rail on the rear porch, replacement of windows and the remodeling of the upstairs bathroom which included the installation of period-correct fixtures.FlaglerLive. Botox for Historic Holden House. FlaglerLive.com, July 17, 2010. Holden Family History Thomas Holden was born and raised in Palatka, FL and moved to Bunnell in 1914. He was a prominent Flagler County pharmacist, businessman, realtor, community activist and politician. In 1916, he purchased the Smith Drug Store in Bunnell and changed its name to Holden's Pharmacy where he began operating his pharmaceutical business. He married Ethel Lura Bortree Holden on December 25, 1917 and they had two daughters, Altajane Caudill (1919-2007), and Eleanor \\"Tommie\\" Black Shutt (1926-2017), who were raised in the house and later became pharmacists. In 1920, his political career began when he was elected Mayor of Bunnell. In 1924, he was appointed a School Trustee of Bunnell High School. In 1926, he opened, owned and operated the Holden Realty Company in Bunnell. In 1930, he built a new brick commercial building in Bunnell where he moved his Holden's Pharmacy, and operated this business in that building until he sold it in 1951. In 1938, he became a director and later an Executive Vice President of the Citizens Bank of Bunnell. He was a member of the Order of Eastern Star, Bunnell Lodge #200 Free & Accepted Masons, and an Ambassador of the Morocco Temple of Jacksonville. He also served as a director of the Federal Housing Agency in Flagler County. In 1967, he was honored by the Florida State Pharmaceutical Association for his 50 years as a registered pharmacist.

He began his career with the Wallachian military forces, serving as Spatharios and seeing action in the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War of 1633. Related by marriage to the Craiove»ôti dynasty, he emerged as one of the country's most important officials under Prince Matei Basarab: as Vistier, he was in charge of the princely treasury, and also became a regent (or Caimacam) in 1645. Matei also adopted Stroe's son, Istratie Leurdeanu, but in 1651 turned against the family, and found Stroe guilty of embezzlement. He returned to high favor under a new Prince, Constantin »òerban, who made him his Logothete. Chased out of the country by the Seimeni rebellion and again during Constantin »òerban's downfall, the Leurdeanus remained at the center of political life into the 1660s. Although he ordered Istratie's execution, Prince Mihnea III used Stroe as his diplomat, causing the latter to be detained as a hostage by the Ottoman Empire. From 1660, he enjoyed the favors of Mihnea's replacement, George Ghica, who kept him as Logothete. Grigore I Ghica appointed Leurdeanu as regent during the Austro‚ÄìTurkish War. This moment saw the eruption of a conflict between Leurdeanu and the Cantacuzino family. In 1664, he engineered an intrigue which led to the execution of Postelnic Constantin I Cantacuzino. Sidelined under Radu Leon, Leurdeanu was brought to justice by Antonie VodƒÉ in 1669. Sentenced to death but then pardoned, he was forced to take orders at Snagov Monastery. He escaped and fled abroad, returning to Wallachia as Grigore Ghica retook the throne, and again served as regent during the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War of 1672. Befriending Ghica's successor, George Ducas, he was kept by the latter as Logothete, Vornic, and occasional Ispravnic of the throne. He was victorious over the Cantacuzinos in his final years, overseeing the arrest and torture of Constantin II. Leurdeanu probably died as a monk, at some point before December 1679. He had many sons, but only two are known to have survived him. One was Stroe II, who maintained leading positions at the court of Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu, together with his nephew Radu Golescu. The Leurdeanu line was nevertheless extinguished, and survived into modernity through a collateral branch, the Golescu family. Biography Rise Leurdeanu is seen by various historians as one of the most significant boyars in early modern Romanian history,Novac, p. 214; Stoicescu, p. 204 when Wallachia was an autonomous subject of the Ottoman Empire. He was born ca. 1600 as the son of Wallachia's Great Logothete, Fiera Leudeanu, and as such a relative of Constantin »òerban, who would become Prince of Wallachia in the 1650s.Stoicescu, pp. 204, 206 Several sources suggest that Stroe's mother was Tudora, Fiera's second wife and previously the paramour of Prince Michael the Brave; if proven, this would make Stroe a half-brother of Michael's boyaress daughter, Marula CornƒÉ»õeanca.Stoicescu, pp. 181, 204, 206 From his marriages, Fiera also had sons VintilƒÉ, Nedelco and Neagu, none of whom managed to enter titular boyardom; Fiera's daughters include Stanca, who married Balica of Breasta, and an anonymous wife of Vornic Dumitru Dudescu.Stoicescu, p. 203 Leurdeanu's first assignment appears to have been as Postelnic from June 15, 1625, under Alexandru Coconul; he is next mentioned as Spatharios of the Wallachian military forces on January 8, 1627.Stoicescu, p. 204 His father had his final commission in 1626, dying at some point in 1629.Stoicescu, p. 203 During his subsequent ascent, Stroe was married three times. No surviving document mentions the name of his first wife, though she is known to have given birth to his eldest son, Istratie Leurdeanu.Stoicescu, pp. 204, 206 She may also have given birth to two of Stroe's other known sons, Sluger Nedelco and Clucer Costea.Stoicescu, p. 206 Stroe's last two wives are known by name. The first was Vi»ôa Goleasca, related to the Craiove»ôti-Br√¢ncoveanu family‚Äîdaughter of the Greek Postelnic Fota and niece of Preda Br√¢ncoveanu, she was more distantly related to Matei Basarab, who took the Wallachian throne in 1632.Stoicescu, pp. 170, 181, 186, 188, 203‚Äì204, 205. See also Bengescu, p. 14; Novac, p. 214 According to family tradition, Vi»ôa had in fact been adopted by her princely relative, meaning that Leurdeanu was symbolically Matei's son-in-law.Bengesco, p. 14 The third and last of Leurdeanu's wives was another one of Prince Matei's relatives, Elina of Prooroci (died 1655).Stoicescu, pp. 204, 205 An untitled boyar during most of Alexandru IV Ilia»ô's reign, Stroe returned on April 27, 1629 to serve as Logothete. One record also cites him as Great Stolnic between November 21, 1632 and February 8, 1633, but he continued to be cited as a Logothete after that interval.Stoicescu, pp. 204, 205. See also Turcu, p. 322 In October 1633, at the height of a Polish‚ÄìOttoman War, he is cited as fighting alongside the Ottoman Army.Bengesco, p. 19; Stoicescu, p. 205 His tenure as Logothete straddled the rules of Alexandru IV, Leon Tom»ôa, and Matei Basarab, to October 6, 1635. On December 20, Matei made Leurdeanu a Logothete of the treasury, and later simply a treasurer (Vistier); he held those twin offices to March 2, 1641.Stoicescu, p. 204 Banking on his wife's influence at the court, he obtained the village of SlƒÉnicul de Jos in Muscel County, ignoring a rival claim stated by the VlƒÉdescu boyars.Anton Manea, p. 18 From November 11 to November 23, 1641, Stroe was Wallachia's Great Stolnic, returning as Great Treasurer on December 24, and serving there to February 25, 1651.Stoicescu, pp. 204, 206 For most of this interval, he was seconded by his son Istratie.Stoicescu, p. 206 Stroe and Logothete Radu CocorƒÉscu were fully in charge of Wallachia's government in August 1645, while Prince Matei was √Æn priumblare (\\"taking leave\\").Stoicescu, p. 205 During this first portion of his career, Leurdeanu became noted as an art patron and ktitor: by 1646, he had constructed the Orthodox church on his wife's land in Gole»ôti; he also refurbished Viero»ôi Monastery, where before 1647 he had buried a son, Necula (died 1633), and a daughter, Axinia.Stoicescu, p. 205. See also Bengesco, p. 17, 19 Vi»ôa was also dead by 1655, when Leurdeanu began litigation against his in-laws over her estate.Stoicescu, pp. 204, 205 First disgrace and return According to various reports, the childless Prince Matei was grooming Istratie to be his heir on the throne.Gane, pp. 239‚Äì240; Novac, p. 214; Stoicescu, p. 207 The Craiove»ôti‚ÄìLeurdeanu alliance soon gave way to violent rivalry, in circumstances that are not entirely elucidated. According to chronicler Georgius Krauss, jealous boyars suggested to Matei that Istratie was plotting to have him killed.Stoicescu, p. 207 A document dated to 1652 clarifies that Stroe was sacked upon revelations of embezzlement; a 1654 writ left by Constantin »òerban claims that Stroe narrowly escaped decapitation, though he was innocent of the charges.Stoicescu, pp. 176, 204, 205. See also Novac, pp. 214‚Äì215 Historian Vasile Novac also notes that the details of the accusation are implausible: Stroe was alleged to have taken 42,500 thaler in one single strike.Novac, pp. 214‚Äì215 According to writer Constantin Gane, the boyars \\"did not want\\" Istratie to rule over them, which led them to fabricate charges against him as well.Gane, p. 240 This looming threat caused Istratie to seek protection in territory more directly controlled by the Ottomans. Prince Matei was allegedly \\"infuriated\\" by his behavior, persecuting Nedelco and Costea, and confiscating one of the Leurdeanus' village fiefs.Stoicescu, pp. 206, 207 However, Krauss also claims that the families eventually reconciled when Matei allowed Istratie to return home. In this account, the Prince ensured that Istratie married well, to Ilinca‚Äîdaughter of Nicolae PƒÉtra»ôcu and granddaughter of Michael the Brave.Stoicescu, p. 207 On April 27, 1654, days after Prince Matei's death, Stroe Leurdeanu was made Logothete by Constantin »òerban, who had usurped the throne; the following day, Istratie was reinstated as Postelnic.Stoicescu, pp. 204, 206 Stroe's first diplomatic assignment was a mission to the Sublime Porte, obtaining »òerban's recognition by Sultan Mehmed IV.Stoicescu, p. 204 Map of Tabaci mahala (shaded orange) as it looked in the 17th century. Leurdeanu's home was located just north of Sf√¢ntul Ioan-Grecesc, near the mouth of Tabaci stream, and four streets west of the princely court This ascendancy was interrupted by the Seimeni uprising in February 1655. After February 15, he had left Wallachia and taken refuge in the Principality of Transylvania, at Corona (Bra»ôov),Stoicescu, p. 204 being joined there by his wife and children.Novac, p. 215 The rebels ransacked his Bucharest residence, which was located outside Sf√¢ntul Ioan-Grecesc Church, in Tabaci mahala.Cernovodeanu & VƒÉtƒÉmanu, pp. 36‚Äì37, 44; Novac, p. 215 The attack probably involved the mahalas eponymous tanners.Cernovodeanu & VƒÉtƒÉmanu, pp. 36‚Äì37 Elina's two sisters later testified that the family's wealth was much affected by the uprising, which also destroyed the villages owned by Stroe and took away his \\"Gypsies\\" (see Slavery in Romania).Novac, p. 215 Once »òerban toppled the rebel leader Hrizea of BogdƒÉnei, Leurdeanu could return as Logothete, serving as such from October 13, 1655 to January 30, 1658; during the final year of »òerban's reign, he had again lost his office.Stoicescu, p. 204 His son by Vi»ôa, generally known in sources as Matei Golescu, also climbed through the ranks, serving as »òerban's Spatharios.Stoicescu, p. 186 As »òerban rebelled against the Ottomans in late 1658, Leurdeanu remained by his side. He was attached to »òerban's court as it escaped into Transylvania, but returned by December 9 to be made treasurer by his usurper, Mihnea III.Stoicescu, p. 204 As noted by historian Constantin Rezachevici, Mihnea, in reality a Greek merchant, was entirely without internal support, and asked the »òerbanist boyars to return in order to better secure his throne.Rezachevici, p. 99 Leurdeanu served as Mihnea's Logothete to August 30, 1659.Stoicescu, p. 204 Again dispatched to Istanbul, he found himself imprisoned as a hostage for two months, as a guarantee that Mihnea would honor his debt to his various Ottoman creditors.Stoicescu, p. 204 At around the same time, Mihnea III accused Istratie Leurdeanu of treason and oversaw his execution.Rezachevici, pp. 100‚Äì104; Stoicescu, p. 206 He still nominated Stroe as one of his leading counsels, though, as Rezachevici notes, he could no longer have any guarantee of loyalty from a bereaved father. According to Rezachievici, the surviving Leaurdeanus agreed to an alliance with Mihnea only because of their mutual hatred for an Ottoman protege, Constantin I Cantacuzino, who was emerging as a kingmaker among Wallachia's boyars.Rezachevici, pp. 103‚Äì104 Ghica's protege Stroe preserved his high office following the appointment of George Ghica as Prince, being confirmed as Logothete on January 21, 1660. He would serve as such to August 28 of the same year, returning as Vornic from January 11, 1661 to December 2, 1665.Stoicescu, p. 204. See also Rezachevici, p. 110 This tenure also saw him serving two short terms as Wallachian regent, or Caimacam, in 1663 and 1664‚Äîalongside Dumitra»ôcu Cantacuzino; at the time, Ghica was overseeing Wallachian participation in the Austro‚ÄìTurkish War.Stoicescu, pp. 135, 204. See also Gane, pp. 330‚Äì332; Novac, p. 215 From September 1660, Grigore I Ghica's reign sparked a latent civil war between the main branches of the Cantacuzino family and a coalition formed by Greek and Romanian boyars. Though generally known in historiography as the BƒÉleanu party, after Gheorghe BƒÉleanu, the latter camp was in fact organized around Leurdeanu, and, according to Rezachevici, would be more accurately known as the Leurdenists.Rezachevici, pp. 105‚Äì106, 108, 114, 115, 116‚Äì117 According to several Romanian historians, the conflict was unavoidable once Constantin I, at the time a Postelnic, intervened to prevent the sacking of Wallachia by its two Caimacami.Gane, p. 331 Despite being Constantin I's nephew, Dumitra»ôcu took Stroe's side, and was widely seen as subordinate to his will; their co- conspirators were a Romanian Paharnic Staico Buc»ôanu, and two prominent Greeks, Balasache Muselim and Nicula Sofialiul.Rezachevici, pp. 106‚Äì107. See also Gane, pp. 330‚Äì332, 342‚Äì344 In 1663, Leurdeanu and Dumitra»ôcu took measures to curb the Postelnics rise. They reputedly informed Grigore Ghica about the goings-on at the court, alleging in particular that »òerban Cantacuzino intended to take the throne. While Gane believes the accusation was \\"calumny [and] crazy talk\\",Gane, pp. 331‚Äì332, 333 Rezachevici notes that it was sufficiently plausible.Rezachevici, pp. 108, 111 According to the 18th- century chronicler Constantin CƒÉpitanul Filipescu, Ghica had his own suspicions against the Postelnics sons, as they had rejected his plans for rebelling against the Ottomans with Habsburg support.Gane, p. 333 Returning to Bucharest with his defeated army, Prince Grigore ordered a confrontation of the boyar witnesses at Craiova, during which Mare»ô BƒÉjescu took the Postelnics side and accused the others of perjury.Gane, p. 332‚Äì333 Upon the end of this summary trial in December 1664, Ghica ordered Constantin I's strangling.Gane, pp. 333‚Äì336; Novac, p. 215; Rezachevici, pp. 106, 108; Stoicescu, pp. 135‚Äì136, 204. See also Bengesco, pp. 15‚Äì17; Panaitescu, pp. 435‚Äì436, 448‚Äì449 His killing disgusted the Wallachian public, in particular for its relative secrecy, expediency, and execution method.Rezachevici, pp. 106, 108 »òerban Cantacuzino received a less drastic treatment: Ghica ordered his \\"carving at the nose\\", which theoretically invalidated him from ever becoming Prince.Gane, p. 333 The clampdown also caused the Postelnics other heir, DrƒÉghici Cantacuzino, to flee Wallachia; he died at Istanbul in 1667, possibly murdered by Sofialiul.Stoicescu, p. 137 Ghica himself was deposed by the Porte in December 1664. Trying to gain the upper hand over his rivals, Leurdeanu dispatched to Istanbul a delegation of boyars, who proposed Dumitra»ôco Buzoianu, a Wallachian squire, as Prince. This \\"tool in the hand of the Stroe Leurdeanu group\\" was never considered, and another Greek man, Radu Leon, was sent to rule from Bucharest.Rezachevici, p. 112 Leurdeanu's tenure as Vornic ended on December 2, a date which marked his third refuge into Transylvania.Stoicescu, p. 204 He returned to Wallachia around January 1666, though he no longer held offices at the court under Radu.Stoicescu, p. 204 In 1668, after a period of relative peace, the Cantacuzino party intended to expose Leurdeanu's guilt by suggesting he sign a writ which attested Constantin I's innocence.Gane, p. 343 The Prince himself acknowledged that Stroe was a murderer, but ignored Cantacuzino pleas to have him tried, and instead allowed the Leurdeanus to increase in size their landed estates. His attempt to appease both sides failed, and his inaction pushed the Cantacuzinos to declare civil war on the Prince in December 1668.Gane, pp. 343‚Äì344; Rezachevici, pp. 112‚Äì114 According to an apologetic family chronicle, known as Letopise»õul Cantacuzinesc, Prince Radu plotted the mass murder of surviving Cantacuzinos, being assisted in this by Leurdeanu and Muselim.Panaitescu, p. 448 Second disgrace and final return The arrival on the throne of Antonie VodƒÉ in April 1669 was a major setback in Stroe's political career. While his son Matei was openly persecuted,Stoicescu, p. 186 Leurdeanu was arrested and tried for his participation in Cantacuzino's killing. The Cantacuzinos produced three letters, which reputedly showed Stroe urging Ghica to physically liquidate their patriarch. However, in the anti-Cantacuzino epic known as Cronica BƒÉlenilor, these are described as inauthentic documents.Panaitescu, pp. 448‚Äì449, 463 Initially sentenced to death,Bengesco, p. 15; Gane, pp. 344‚Äì345; Panaitescu, p. 436; Rezachevici, p. 114; Stoicescu, p. 204 he was pardoned by the Prince. This was reportedly requested by Constantin I's widow, Elina, who asked that Stroe be instead ordered to spend his remaining years in monastic solitude.Bengesco, p. 15; Gane, pp. 344‚Äì345; Panaitescu, p. 436 Leurdeanu was stripped of his clothes and made to wear his letters as a necklace, then placed in a wagon which took him from Bucharest to Snagov Monastery.Gane, p. 345 Upon taking orders, he defied his peers by asking to be renamed \\"Mohamet\\".Gane, p. 345; Novac, p. 215 Eventually taking the name Silvestru (first recorded in April 1670), he managed a fourth escape into Transylvania in 1671; Prince Antonie sent letters asking that he be apprehended and returned.Stoicescu, pp. 204‚Äì205, 206, 215. See also Bengesco, p. 15 By then, Leurdeanu's exiled partisans had reached out to the Ottoman overlord, depicting Antonie as an irresponsible ruler.Rezachevici, p. 114 Matei Golescu was still in Wallachia: also in 1670, Antonie heard a complaint from Clucer Tudoran VlƒÉdescu, who wanted to be returned ownership of SlƒÉnicul de Jos. He earned support from Dositheos II of Jerusalem, and eventually Matei lost the village.Anton Manea, pp. 18‚Äì19 The Leurdeanus also sold their land in C√¢mpulung to Radu Toma NƒÉsturel, who established a princely school on that location.Ioan N. Ionescu, \\"»òcoala Na»õionalƒÉ DomneascƒÉ. Cea mai veche »ôcoalƒÉ din C√¢mpulung\\", in Universul Literar, Issue 13/1916, pp. 4‚Äì5 Evading his pursuers, Leurdeanu reached Ghica's exile court at Vidin in Rumelia.Stoicescu, p. 205. See also Gane, p. 346 By April 1672, he had returned with the latter to Wallachia. Though untitled, he served on the Boyar Assembly, almost uninterruptedly, from April 1672 to June 1673.Stoicescu, p. 205 He was again made Wallachian regent (or Ispravnic of the throne) in 1672 and again in 1673; on both occasions, Ghica was leading Wallachian troops participating in the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War.Stoicescu, p. 205. See also Gane, p. 348 During this interval, he reportedly ordered the arrest and torture of other Cantacuzino heirs, including the future Stolnic and historian Constantin II.Gane, pp. 346‚Äì348 In December 1673, as George Ducas replaced Ghica on the throne, Leurdeanu again fled to Transylvania. Nevertheless, Ducas sent for him, promising him and his partisans that \\"no harm would come to them, but rather that he would hold them in great esteem.\\" The news was delivered to Stroe by DrƒÉghici's son P√¢rvu Cantacuzino, their encounter being described by Gane as a \\"sit-down between dog and wolf\\".Gane, p. 367 Agreeing to return home, Stroe was Logothete from February 28 to March 28, and Vornic from April 29 to May 5, 1674.Stoicescu, p. 205. See also Rezachevici, p. 115 He became regent, or Ispravnic, from May 11, 1675, and again in June‚ÄìSeptember 1677‚Äîthis was the interval during which Ducas served as Cossack Hetman in Right-bank Ukraine.Stoicescu, p. 205 Golescu arms, as recorded in 1918 The truce between the two feuding parties was short-lived. Peace was broken once the Cantacuzinos framed Leurdeanu's friend Radu Dudescu for treason. Stroe took revenge by persuading Ducas to imprison Constantin II in 1676.Gane, pp. 367‚Äì368 For a while in 1677, the Vornic was involved in a property dispute with the monks of Sf√¢ntul Ioan-Grecesc Church: Leurdeanu defended his right to draw water from D√¢mbovi»õa River while trespassing on church grounds. The conflict was finally settled by two other boyars, namely Radu Cre»õulescu and Vistier V√¢lcu.Novac, p. 214 Sources show that in 1678 Stroe was no longer a regent in Bucharest: Ducas preferred a triumvirate of Caimacami, presided upon by »òerban Cantacuzino.Gane, pp. 368‚Äì369 Possibly reverting to his status as a monk, Leurdeanu was last mentioned as being alive on March 15, 1678, and is known to have been dead by December 18, 1679.Stoicescu, pp. 205, 206 He was buried at Sf√¢ntul Ioan-Grecesc.Stoicescu, p. 205 Legacy Vornic Leurdeanu was certainly survived by two of his sons: Pitar Stroe II and a Hieromonk Ghenadie; Matei Golescu was last attested for having served as Comis in 1673.Stoicescu, pp. 186, 205, 207 One document from 1680 suggests that Stroe Sr may have also had a living daughter, married to »òerban P√¢rvu Cantacuzino, grandson of his enemy DrƒÉghici.Stoicescu, pp. 143‚Äì144. See also Bengesco, p. 15; Gane, p. 331; Rezachevici, p. 105 Pitar Stroe reconciled with the Cantacuzinos and the Craiove»ôti, serving three short terms as Wallachia's Caimacam under Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu; his own son, Statie, married Ilinca, daughter of Stolnic Constantin II.Stoicescu, pp. 207, 243‚Äì244 While Istratie had died childless, Matei Golescu's son, diplomat Radu Golescu, would play an important part in the Pruth River Campaign and the Turkish War of 1716; one of his daughters was matriarch of the modern Golescu family.Bengesco, pp. 19‚Äì27; Novac, pp. 215‚Äì217; Stoicescu, pp. 186‚Äì187, 206 Stroe's eponymous estate of Leordeni was inherited by Stroe's great-granddaughter Safta, who married into the Cre»õulescu family. In the 19th century, it became the domain of doctor- politician Nicolae Cre»õulescu. \\"Nicolae Kretzulescu »ôi mo»ôia de la Leordeni\\", in Jurnal de Arge»ô, May 28, 2014 In addition to his patronage of churches at Viero»ôi and Gole»ôti, Leurdeanu inaugurated work on the family manor in the latter village.Bengesco, pp. 15, 17; Soare & DrƒÉgan Popescu, p. 468 Unlike the latter, his home in Tabaci no longer exists, having been leveled to build CEC Palace.Soare & DrƒÉgan Popescu, p. 468 Gole»ôti church preserved two silk stoles, donated by –°TPO–Ñ –í–ÑŒõ–¨ –í–ò–°TIA (\\"Stroe the Great Treasurer\\") and his wife Vi»ôa, and now displayed by the National Museum of Art of Romania.Turcu, pp. 322‚Äì325, 330 Of the paintings commissioned by Leurdeanu, only one portrait of him and his family survives in a watercolor copy; the original was probably at Leordeni church. It shows Leurdeanu wearing a combination of Ottoman and Polish clothes, including the kontusz, and donning a chupryna hairdo.Soare & DrƒÉgan Popescu, pp. 468‚Äì469 As noted by author Gheorghe Bengescu, the first generations of Romanian historians \\"have shown themselves to be more than harsh in depicting Stroe Leurdeanu, though he had always denied, including during his trial, any participation in the crime for which he stood accused.\\"Bengesco, pp. 15‚Äì16 The Cantacuzinos, who retained political prominence into the 20th century, cultivated Leurdeanu's image as an antagonist. His sentencing was the subject of a mural painting by Nicolae Vermont, commissioned in 1909 for the Cantacuzino Palace in Bucharest. Narcis Dorin Ion, \\"Elitele »ôi arhitectura reziden»õialƒÉ (IX).

KETE broadcasts a Christian preaching format, featuring programming from the Three Angels Broadcasting Network. History KETE received an initial License to Cover from the Federal Communications Commission on September 14, 2009. It was originally owned by La Ke Manda Broadcasting, and was sold to the current owner North Texas Radio Group, L.P. on January 11, 2012. North Texas Radio Group, L.P. sold the facility to The Way Radio Group on August 11, 2014, with KETE becoming Christian Contemporary \\"99.7 Way-FM\\". North Texas Radio Group continued to lease their FM relay translator, 100.9 K265DW Mount Pleasant, Texas to The Way Radio Group in order to extend KETE's coverage area into Mount Pleasant, due to the facility's inability to provide the town city grade coverage itself. On February 2, 2018, North Texas Radio Group L.P. re-acquired KETE from The Way Radio Group/Promise Radio Group. K265DW had been silent for nearly a year at the point of re-acquisition by North Texas Radio Group, and internal issues within The Way Radio Group led the company to sell the facility back to Dick Witkowski, who owns North Texas Radio Group. The facility was silenced on March 21, 2018, and a construction permit has been granted to move KETE to a new broadcast tower site. While the facility will increase the height above average terrain to 113 meters, it will decrease ERP to 2.3 kilowatts. The facility had to return to broadcasting at either the currently licensed transmission site or under the new specifications listed in the construction permit granted by the Federal Communications Commission no later than March 21, 2019, or the license would have been revoked and deleted by Federal law. KETE returned to the air on March 19, 2019. K265DW has also since resumed operations, changing its license to rebroadcast KPIT as its primary feed, although that facility has recently been sold to a new owner. On October 10, 2019, North Texas Radio Group filed an application to transfer the license of KETE to Brazos TV Inc. for $122,500. A Time Brokerage Agreement took effect on October 10, with the station flipping to Three Angels Broadcasting Network, a Christian preaching and teaching format. The sale to Brazos TV was consummated on December 26, 2019.

In October 2019, he became the youngest cricketer in the world to score a List A double century. He has been signed by Rajasthan Royals for to play in IPL 2020. Early life Jaiswal was born on 28 December 2001 in Suriyawan, Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh, as the fourth of six children, to Bhupendra Jaiswal, owner of a small hardware store, and Kanchan Jaiswal, a housewife. At the age of ten, he moved to Dadar, Mumbai, in order to receive cricket training at Azad Maidan. As Dadar was far away from the Maidan, he relocated to Kalbadevi neighbourhood where he was given accommodation in a dairy shop in return for low-grade work. He was eventually ejected by the shopkeeper as he was unable to provide much help at the shop in between his cricket training. Having no place of his own, Jaiswal stayed in a tent with the groundsmen at the Maidan, where he often slept hungry and sold panipuri to make ends meet. After living in tents for three years, Jaiswal's cricketing talent was spotted in December 2013 by Jwala Singh, who ran a cricket academy in Santacruz. Singh took Jaiswal under his wing and provided him a place to stay, before becoming his legal guardian and obtaining his power of attorney. Career Jaiswal plays the pull shot during a Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Chhattisgarh. Youth career Jaiswal first came to the limelight in 2015 when he scored 319 not out and took 13/99 in a Giles Shield match, an all-round record in school cricket, which was recognized by Limca Book of Records. He was then selected in Mumbai under-16 squad followed by India under-19s. Jaiswal was the highest run-scorer (318 runs) and player of the tournament at the 2018 ACC Under-19 Asia Cup which India won. In 2019, he struck 173 off 220 balls in a Youth Test match against South Africa under-19s, who were bowled out for 152 and 85, in an innings win. Later that year, he scored 294 runs in 7 matches, including four half-centuries, in the under-19 tri-series in England which also featured Bangladesh. In December 2019, he was named in India's squad for the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He became the leading scorer in the tournament, and scored a century against Pakistan in the semifinal. Senior career Jaiswal made his first-class debut for Mumbai in the 2018‚Äì19 Ranji Trophy on 7 January 2019. He made his List A debut on 28 September 2019, for Mumbai in the 2019‚Äì20 Vijay Hazare Trophy. On 16 October 2019, he scored 203 runs off 154 balls in a Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Jharkhand and became the youngest double centurion in the history of List A cricket at 17 years, 292 days. His knock included 17 fours and 12 sixes against a bowling attack consisting of Varun Aaron and Shahbaz Nadeem. He was one of the top five run-scorers at the 2019‚Äì20 Vijay Hazare Trophy, with 564 runs in 6 matches at an average of 112.80. He was named in the India B squad for the 2019‚Äì20 Deodhar Trophy.

Areas  The different areas of software diversity are discussed in surveys on diversity for fault-tolerance or for security. A recent survey emphasizes on the most recent advances in the field. The main areas are: * design diversity, n-version programming, data diversity for fault tolerance * randomization * software variability  Domains  Software can be diversified in most domains: * in firmware of embedded systems and sensors * in internet applications * in mobile applications  Techniques   Code transformations  It is possible to amplify software diversity through automated transformation processes that create synthetic diversity. A \\"multicompiler\\" is compiler embedding a diversification engine. A multi-variant execution environment (MVEE) is responsible for selecting the variant to execute and compare the output. Fred Cohen was among the very early promoters of such an approach. He proposed a series of rewriting and code reordering transformations that aim at producing massive quantities of different versions of operating systems functions. These ideas have been developed over the years and have led to the construction of integrated obfuscation schemes to protect key functions in large software systems. Another approach to increase software diversity of protection consists in adding randomness in certain core processes, such as memory loading. Randomness implies that all versions of the same program run differently from each other, which in turn creates a diversity of program behaviors. This idea was initially proposed and experimented by Stephanie Forrest and her colleagues. Recent work on automatic software diversity explores different forms of program transformations that slightly vary the behavior of programs. The goal is to evolve one program into a population of diverse programs that all provide similar services to users, but with a different code. This diversity of code enhances the protection of users against one single attack that could crash all programs at the same time. Transformation operators include: * code layout randomization: reorder functions in code * globals layout randomization: reorder and pad globals * stack variable randomization: reorder variables in each stack frame * heap layout randomization As exploring the space of diverse programs is computationally expensive, finding efficient strategies to conduct this exploration is important. To do so, recent work studies plastic regions in software code: plastic regions are those parts is code more susceptible to be changed without disrupting the functionalities provided by the piece of software. These regions can be specifically targeted by automatic code transformation to create artificial diversity in existing software.  Natural software diversity  It is known that some functionalities are available in multiple interchangeable implementations, this has been called natural software diversity. This natural diversity can be exploited, for example it has been shown valuable to increase security in cloud systems. Natural diversity can also be used to combine the strengths of different tools: for example if you combine many decompilers together, the resulting meta-decompiler is more effective.

He studied the classics at the Nazareno College in addition to mathematics, physics and foreign languages and in 1764 graduated from the Sapienza University of Rome. He chose to follow an ecclesiastic career but never completed his studies. He was nevertheless appointed abbot of Valvisciolo Abbey. Between 1765 and 1772 he was Regent of the chancellery and in the latter year Pope Clement XIV named him a non-participating apostolic protonotary. Between 1775 and 1785 he worked to create a large library in the family home. He attended cultural meetings and was a member of various academic societies. He commissioned the Swiss painter Angelika Kauffmann to paint two canvasses on subjects inspired by episodes of the novel The Adventures of Telemachus by Fran√ßois F√©nelon.

She is the daughter of social leader Berta C√°ceres, murdered in 2016. Soon after assuming her mother's role of general coordinator of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) in May 2017, Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres survived an attempt on her own life. Early life Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres was born in 1990, the daughter of Berta C√°ceres and Salvador Z√∫√±iga. She is second of four children, with two sisters and a brother. Her parents separated before she was ten. She was raised by her mother in the home of her grandmother, Austra Berta Flores, a civil servant who served as mayor of La Esperanza, governor of Intibuc√°, and deputy in the National Congress, unusual roles for women in the area at that time. When Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres was three, her mother founded COPINH, with her father as one of the original members. The organization is dedicated to the defense of the rights of the Lenca people and the defense of the environment, two of her mother's great passions, along with combatting sexual discrimination and the oppression of women and LGBT communities, all issues Berta C√°ceres saw as interconnected. COPINH from the start had many detractors, which contributed to a turbulent early life for Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres, whose family experienced death threats, physical assaults, and the imprisonment of Z√∫√±iga. Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres grew up joining in the activities of COPINH with her family. Like her siblings, after a brief period in regular schools, she attended popular education schools, where she received anti-capitalist and anti-patriarchal training. She graduated from college in Cuba before beginning to work towards a master's degree in Latin American Studies in Mexico City. Murder of her mother After the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat, repression against COPINH and other social organizations escalated. Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres' mother, one of the main indigenous leaders, was persecuted and threatened in particular for her struggle against the environmental and social consequences of the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project. At 23:40 on March 2, 2016, Berta C√°ceres was murdered by two armed invaders to her home. Initially, the Honduran government pursued the matter as a crime of passion or as internal political struggles within COPINH, denying a connection to Berta C√°ceres's political activism. Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres demanded both national and international investigations into the crime and also began campaigning to support a bill in the United States for that country to suspend military support to Honduras until the latter state can demonstrate that it has taken action against the murders of human rights activists. By March 2018, nine men, including retired and active Honduran military and two of the developers of the Aqua Zara project, had been accused of complicity in the crime, with one declaring that the murder had been a paid assassination. In February 2018, Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres expressed her belief that the government involved in the investigation are focusing on lower level conspirators to avoid acknowledging possible involvement of higher placed officials. Allegations have been made by former Honduran military that Berta C√°ceres's name was included in a military hit list. In Honduras, since the 2009 coup, at least 124 activists for environmental and land protection have been killed. General Coordinator of COPINH After Berta C√°ceres's murder, Z√∫√±iga C√°ceres left her studies in Mexico City to take up the leadership of COPINH, and in May 2017 she was elected general coordinator of that body, the same position her mother occupied before her murder. From this position, she has continued her social and environmental struggle, especially against the installation of megaprojects that COPINH assert threaten economic, social, cultural and environmental rights of the Lenca people. A few weeks after assuming the leadership of COPINH, she survived an attack perpetrated against her and other members of that organization by armed attackers who attacked the vehicle holding the group with rocks and machetes and attempted to force them off the road over a cliff.

She was the last person burned for witchcraft in Dundee.  Life  Jaffray was born in Aberdeen and then moved to Dundee. Little is known about her life, however it is known that Jaffray married James Butchart, a Dundee Burgess, in 1615. It is suspected she was part of the influential Jaffrays of Aberdeen, Alexander Jaffray who was Provost of Aberdeen in 1651.  Accusations and death  Jaffray was accused of being a spaewife. Her husband was also charged. The records relating to the accusations have been lost, however the names of the three responsible are known. All three of the accusers were leading ministers in the Dundee Presbytery at the time: Harry Scrymsour of St Mary's, John Guthrie of South Church and William Rait of Third Charge (now St Paul's). Jaffray was interrogated and she accused several others of being witches. She was sent to trial by Dundee Privy Council on 11 November 1669. She was found guilty. Before being burned, Jaffray was strangled. She is allegedly buried in the Howff graveyard in Dundee, however it is unlikely that an alleged witch would be buried on consecrated ground. Her husband escaped execution and he finished his life in a poor house.  Legacy  Despite this a 'witches stone' stands in the spot where she is supposedly buried. Local legend has it that leaving her an offering can bring good luck to those in need, the marker can frequently be found with coins and other simple offerings placed upon it. She has her name featured on a plaque that was installed on Peter Street as part of the Dundee Women's' Trail as well as a mosaic of a torch that both allegedly mark the spot of her death. Her life has inspired a book of fiction titled \\"I Am Grissel Jaffray\\" by Claire-Marie Watson, which won the Dundee 6000 award.

History The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. The theorists hadn't foreseen that trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns had robbed them of the mobility they had been counting on and like in the Franco-Prussian War and Russo-Turkish War the need for high-angle heavy artillery reasserted itself. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell and that meant emptying the fortresses and scouring the depots for guns held in reserve. It also meant converting coastal artillery and surplus naval guns to siege guns by either giving them simple field carriages or mounting the larger pieces on rail carriages. Design The 15 cm Ring Kanone L/30 was a typical built-up gun constructed of steel with a central rifled tube, reinforcing layers of hoops, and trunnions. This type of breech was known as a cylindro-prismatic breech which was a predecessor of Krupp's horizontal sliding-block and the gun used separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The 15 cm Ring Kanone L/30 was fairly conventional for its time and most combatants during the First World War had similar conversions of naval guns such as the British BL 6-inch Mk VII or the French Canon de 155 L modele 1916. The barrels were mounted on simple two-wheeled steel box trail carriages which did not have a recoil mechanism or a gun shield. The carriages were tall and there was an opening behind the breech to allow high angles of elevation. To facilitate towing on soft ground the wheels were often fitted with Bonagente grousers patented by the Italian major Crispino Bonagente. These consisted of rectangular plates connected with elastic links and are visible in many photographs of World War I artillery from all of the combatants. A set of wooden ramps were placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and the gun was returned to position by gravity. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire.  Naval Use  *Alexandrine-class iron corvettes - This class of ships had a primary armament of ten 15 cm RK L/30 guns in single mounts. **SMS Alexandrine ** SMS Arcona * Irene-class protected cruisers - This class of ships had a mixed primary armament of four 15 cm RK L/30 and ten shorter 15 cm RK L/22 guns in single mounts. **SMS Irene ** SMS Prinzess Wilhelm Photo Gallery File:The_Battle_of_Cambrai,_November-december_1917_Q6339.jpg|A gun captured at Cambrai by the British.

Educated at the Royal Technical College, Stanford University and the University of Strathclyde he is a doctor of philosophy. His research has included studies of the hydrology of the River Clyde and he has written reports on flooding for the Institution of Civil Engineers and the British government. Fleming was involved in the planning stages of the Glasgow Garden Festival of 1988 and established a way of reusing dredgings from the Clyde to provide topsoil for the event. He has since licensed the technology commercially. He is founder and chairman of the EnviroCentre environmental consultancy, of which his son is now managing director.  Early life and academic career  Born in Glasgow, Fleming grew up in a house in Knightswood, Glasgow near to the Forth and Clyde Canal. His childhood spent playing on the canal may have inspired his career as a water engineer. Fleming studied for a Bachelor of Science degree at the Royal Technical College, just as it was transitioning into the University of Strathclyde. He found that structural engineering was too straightforward and preferred to focus on what he considered the more complex, and then less well researched, challenges of hydrology. Fleming investigated the impact that droughts and floods have on soil erosion with a particular focus on the River Clyde. He was granted a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree which was, unusually, split between Strathclyde and Stanford University in California. His PhD investigated the movements of water and sediment in the Clyde system. After this he returned to Strathclyde as a professor of civil engineering. Fleming has authored or co- authored more than 200 academic publications and 15 books. He has also produced four video documentaries. Fleming is a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). He is also a Chartered Environmentalist. Fleming was elected president of the ICE for the November 1999 to November 2000 session. One of his acts as president was to reinstate a traditional 3-yearly conference between the ICE and the ASCE. He co-authored a 2001 ICE report into the Autumn 2000 western Europe floods which recommended a doubling of expenditure on flood defences, the training of more river engineers and better investment in flood prediction. Fleming stated that at that time flood defence works were viewed as \\"a second class operation\\". He was later asked by deputy prime minister John Prescott to chair a commission into the effects of the flooding. Fleming's commission recommended the establishment of a separate body for flooding, taking responsibilities from the Environment Agency which had to deal with the conflicting interests of flood protection, habitat protection and management of development. He later reiterated the recommendations to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. On 23 May 2001 Fleming was elected a fellow of the Transport Research Foundation at which point he was deputy dean of engineering at the University of Birmingham. Fleming served as chairman of the Association of Environmental and Ecological Clerks of Works from its formation until January 2018.  Career in industry  Glasgow Garden Festival Fleming was involved in the planning of the Glasgow Garden Festival and the programme of regeneration that followed it. His academic work had shown that dredgings from the River Clyde contained valuable nutrients washed down from upstream agricultural land and, once treated to remove heavy metals, could be re-used as opposed to being discarded as previous. Fleming generated topsoil for the garden festival this way and subsequently licensed the technology used to a company that sold the material under the brand name ClydeSoil. Fleming also made bricks from the material and investigated whether it could be applied to rivers in Hong Kong and Egypt. He also looked at the possibility of making soil from other waste materials such as quarry dust, forestry waste, paper mill sludge, fish farming by-products and sewage sludge. In addition Fleming developed a surfacing material for roads and sports fields made from a combination of waste, tar, asphalt, tyre rubber and aggregate. At around the time of the festival Fleming established the Landlab, a research unit that studies the self-renewing properties of soil. In 1995 he founded the EnviroCentre engineering consultancy, specialising in environmental matters as he perceived that there was a shortage of companies in that field. It was partially funded by the Glasgow Development Agency and projects included Glasgow Harbour and the Kirkintilloch Link Road (A806). The company, of which Fleming is currently the chairman, now works largely in the energy sector.  Personal life  Fleming has lived in Scotland for most of his life. He farms land in Argyll where he holidayed as a child. His son, Duar Fleming, is managing director of EnviroCentre. He has curated an exhibition of the history of civil engineering at a Scottish museum.

He is a Republican. Early life and career Roy was born in Bethesda, Maryland, and raised in Lovettsville, Virginia. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Virginia and spent three years as an investment banking analyst. He earned his Juris Doctor at the University of Texas School of Law, and worked for then-Texas attorney general John Cornyn. Roy also worked on Cornyn's 2002 campaign for the United States Senate. When Cornyn was elected, Roy joined his staff on the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. He returned to Texas as a prosecutor in the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas. Roy joined the administration of Texas governor Rick Perry as director of the Office of State-Federal Relations. Roy was the ghostwriter of Perry's 2010 book Fed Up! and worked for Perry's 2012 presidential campaign. After Ted Cruz's election to the Senate in 2012, Roy became his chief of staff. According to Politico, Roy was an \\"architect\\" of Cruz's strategy to shut down the government in 2013 over the Affordable Care Act. After Ken Paxton was elected Attorney General of Texas in 2014, Roy became first assistant attorney general. In 2016 Roy left the office of the attorney general to head the Trusted Leadership PAC, which was supporting Cruz's presidential campaign.  U.S. House of Representatives   Elections  In the 2018 elections Roy ran for the United States House of Representatives in to succeed Lamar Smith, who did not run for reelection. During the campaign, Politico likened him to Ted Cruz. During the campaign, Roy said that President Trump was doing a good job, citing as an example Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accords, and praising Trump for attacking \\"the swamp.\\" Roy defeated Matt McCall in the Republican Party primary election, and faced Joseph Kopser in the general election. Roy defeated Kopser 50%‚Äì48% in a closer-than-expected victory. Roy is running for re-election in 2020. He will face Democratic nominee Wendy Davis in the November 2020 general election. Committee assignments *Committee on Oversight and Reform *Committee on the Budget *Committee on Veterans' Affairs Tenure In May 2019, Roy was the only member of the U.S. House to raise procedural objections delaying passage of a request for unanimous consent for a $19.1 billion disaster aid package for damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. The bill was stalled for 11 days before ultimately passing in June 2019 by a margin of 354‚Äì58, with Roy voting against it. Roy received bipartisan criticism for his objection to the bill. He said he voted against it because it added to the national debt and did not include additional spending for federal operations along the U.S.-Mexico border. On June 28, 2019, in response to the humanitarian crisis involving migrant children at the southern border, Roy proposed legislation to amend the Antideficiency Act (ADA) to allow the United States Border Patrol to accept donations from people who want to help migrant children directly. The bill was filed after people attempting to donate supplies such as diapers, toys, and hygiene items were turned away by Border Patrol officials who said they were not accepting donations due to the ADA, which prevents the government from accepting \\"any donations other than what Congress has allocated to it.\\"According to a 2013 article in The Atlantic, the Antideficiency Act (ADA) was originally intended to prevent federal agencies, particularly the military, from overspending their annual budgets early in a fiscal year. Once their funds were depleted, prior to ADA, agencies would then request additional Congressional appropriations forcing Congress to pay so they would not breach their contracts. According to a 2018 CRS report, under the Antideficiency Act, an \\"agency must cease operations\\" if there is a \\"funding gap\\". In shutdowns, \\"the criteria\\" are complex.\\" Since the early 1980s (CRS 2018:5) with a more stringent application of ADA, when there are government shutdowns in the United States, and an agency no longer has funds to operate, they must shut down. They cannot depend on voluntary work of their employees. On December 18, 2019, Roy voted against both articles of impeachment against Trump. Of the 195 Republicans who voted, all voted against both impeachment articles. He is a member of the Freedom Caucus.Freedom Caucus member Chip Roy touts bipartisanship in first campaign ad, The Hill, Juliegrace Brufke, September 9, 2020.  Coronavirus pandemic  In March 2020, Roy was one of 40 representatives to vote against a coronavirus relief bill. In July 2020, Roy blamed surging coronavirus cases in Southern Texas on \\"people coming across our border\\" from Mexico. At the time, the border with Mexico had been closed for all nonessential activity since March. Roy argued that Texas was holding coronavirus numbers down; at the time, cases were surging in Texas. Later that month, Roy said he would not isolate himself even though he had had a lengthy maskless interaction with Representative Louie Gohmert, who tested positive for the coronavirus, on the House floor. In May 2020, Roy said, \\"We need immune systems that are strong. We need immunity systems that can fight this\\", and \\"We need herd immunity.\\" Asked whether acquiring such immunity would entail unnecessary deaths, Roy countered that the countrywide lockdown and attendant delays in accessing cancer screenings or entering into addiction treatment, as well as mental health problems precipitated by unemployment, had increased indirect deaths and suffering.\\"We need herd immunity\\", Texas Tribune, Abby Livingston, May 6, 2020.

Several varieties of plants she cultivated were recognized with awards from the Royal Horticultural Society in London and she was elevated to Baroness by Albert II of Belgium for her contributions to dendrology. Early life Jelena Kovaƒçiƒç was born on 23 August 1925 in Jasenovac, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes to Elza (n√©e Zorƒçiƒç) and Andrej Kovaƒçiƒç. Her parents were ethnically Slovene and originally from Bizeljsko in the Municipality of Bre≈æice. At the time of her birth, Andrej was employed as an agronomist on the Belje estate in the Baranya region of what is now Croatia. She attended elementary school in Kne≈æevo and went on to study at the gymnasiums in Osijek and Ptuj. After completing her secondary education, Kovaƒçiƒç enrolled at the University of Zagreb in 1947. Graduating in 1951, with a degree in agronomy, she worked for a year at the city nursery on the outskirts of Zagreb and then in 1953 was granted a rare permit from Yugoslavia to study abroad. She spent 1953 in Denmark, studying at the Petersen nursery and traveled on to Germany to study at horticultural sites in Schleswig-Holstein. The following year, she arrived in Zundert in the Netherlands to study at the Lombarts Nursery. Hearing that there were historical and rare Stewartia pseudocamellia trees at the old Kort Nursery in Kalmthout, Kovaƒçiƒç bicycled to the site. She discovered that the nursery, founded in 1856 had closed in 1930, but had been purchased in 1952 by a diamond merchant, Robert De Belder and his brother Georges. The brothers became interested in the site when the ancient collection of trees were in danger of being cleared for a housing project. They purchased the plot and expanded the acquisition to encompass about 30 acres (12.5 hectares), attempting to protect the most significant varieties of trees. The brothers also founded the International Dendrology Society (IDS) at Kalmthout in 1952, to promote preservation and conservation of rare or endangered woody plants. During her visit, Kovaƒçiƒç suggested that Robert try propagating his witch hazel plants from cuttings, rather than by transplantation. Joined by their interest in plants, a romance developed between Robert and Kovaƒçiƒç, who were married within three months and she permanently settled in Belgium. Career The first witch hazel grown from cuttings on the property, which would become known as the Arboretum Kalmthout, bloomed in January 1955. The shrub had intense orange-brown flowers which reflected the winter sun. Robert named the variety, Hamamelis √ó intermedia Jelena and entered it that year at an exhibition held in London by the Royal Horticultural Society. The shrub earned a Certificate of Merit, leading the couple to design what would become one of the most well-known arboreta in the world. While Robert worked by day in the diamond business in Antwerp, she focused on sorting through the over-grown landscape to label and identify the plants. In the evenings and when he was not working, Robert worked with Georges to dig the ponds and create the vistas while de Belder worked to develop the plants for the spaces they created. In April 1955, the couple invited Jo≈æe Strgar(sl) to the estate to study and de Belder paved the way for his studies with other European nurseries. Within ten years, the arboretum had reached capacity and the couple bought another, much larger estate, Hemelrijk in Essen, Belgium, containing 250 acres (101.171 hectares). Traveling widely with the International Dendrology Society, the couple collected specimens and created an international exchange network for plant seeds and educational sharing. They also created an extensive library of rare books on botany and horticulture. Known for their open-door policy of inviting students as well as the general public to study at the facility, the couple hosted more than 350 students, including noted Japanese botanist, Mikinori Ogisu. De Belder also began breeding plants, focusing on Hamamelis, Hydrangea and Rhododendron and trees of the genera Malus and Prunus. The couple experimented with Hydrangea paniculata, creating cultivars, including Brussels Lace, Burgundy Lace, Green Spire, Little Lamb, Pink Diamond, The Swan, Unique and \\"White Moth\\" among others, as well as Spreading Beauty from Hydrangea serrata. Typically gardens feature only one witch hazel, as the plant requires a large growing space. De Belder, propagated forty varieties at Kalmthout. One of the seedlings named after their daughter Diane, received the Award of Garden Merit in 1993 from the Royal Horticultural Society for its intense red color. During an economic decline fueled by the oil crisis, Robert's diamond business suffered in the 1980s, and the couple turned the arboretum over to the Province of Antwerp. They relocated to their second estate at Hemelrijk and de Belder continued to propagate ornamental plants. She was the author of a cookbook, Okus po cvetju: kulinariƒçno popotovanje (Ljubljana: DZS, 1994 [A taste for flowers: a culinary journey]) and Life Begins in Autumn (1998). De Belder made a series of documentaries which were broadcast in Solvenia on the national Radiotelevizija Slovenija. These included List in cvet (Leaf and Flower, 1994), Okus po cvetju (Taste of Flowers, 1998) and Okus po plodovih (Taste of Fruit, 2003). After Robert's death in 1995, de Belder was elevated to a Baroness by Albert II of Belgium for her contributions to dendrology. In 1998, she served as the vice president of the Royal Horticulture Society. Death and legacy De Belder died while vacationing on the island of Krk on 31 August 2003 In 2011, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Slovenian independence, the government of Solvenia planted a linden tree in the Arboretum Kalmthout in honor of de Belder.

Anaesthesia associates are not doctors themselves, but rather enter the role by completing a 27-month full-time training programme which leads to the award of a postgraduate diploma. It is classed as a medical associate profession. To be eligible, a candidate must have a previous degree in a biomedical or science subject, or recognised previous healthcare experience in another role. The role was introduced into the UK National Health Service in 2004, under the title of physicians' assistant (anaesthesia), abbreviated to PA(A). The current name for the role was introduced in July 2019. Despite the similarity of the name, the role was always distinct from physician assistant, which refers to a non- doctor practitioner who works in areas of medicine other than anaesthesia. At present, the role is not subject to statutory regulation, meaning it is not mandatory for anaesthesia associates to be registered with any professional body. In July 2019, the UK government announced its intention to request that the General Medical Council would in future regulate anaesthesia associates as a distinct profession.https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written- questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2019-07-18/HCWS1741/ References Category:Anesthesia Category:Health care occupations ","title":"Anaesthesia associate"},{"id":"58835676","text":"Robert \\"Bob\\" Thomas Jones (born September 3, 1978) is an American football former long snapper in the National Football League for the New York Giants.

Early life  Helena de Kay Gilder was born in New York City in 1846 to her father George Coleman de Kay, and her mother Janet de Kay. Her father was a naval officer who died when she was only two years old. After her father's death, her mother moved her and her brother, George, to Dresden Germany where they lived until 1861, before moving back to the United States so her mother could be closer to her older sister Katherine after she became a mother. She was then enrolled in a girl's boarding school located in Farmington, Connecticut. She then studied art at the Cooper Union Institute and National Academy of Design, as well as receiving instruction from artists Winslow Homer and John La Farge. In 1871-72 she was a student in the first life drawing class for women at the National Academy of Design.  Children  Gilder had seven children. Her son, Rodman de Kay Gilder, and her youngest daughter, Rosamond de Kay Gilder, were authors. Her daughter Dorothea de Kay Gilder had a short career as a stage actress.  Marriage  In May 1872, Helena met her husband, Richard Watson Gilder, in the offices of Scribner's Monthly, where Richard was then working as a managing editor. In February 1874, Helena and Richard announced their engagement, and by June of that year they were married. Richard is best known for his work as a poet. Some of his works include The New Day (1875), Five Books of Song (1894), In the Heights (1905), and several more. Helena and Richard amassed a large number of letters in correspondence with each other over their marriage, and Helena was the subject of several love poems written by her husband.  Work  Gilder aspired to be an oil painter, and often did the accompanying illustrations for her husband's books of poetry, like Two Worlds: and Other Poems. Helena de Kay Gilder's best known work was cited as \\"her figure pictures, 'The Young Mother' and 'The Last Arrow' \\" by The Art Amateur. Her impact on the art world spread beyond her own art production. Gilder contributed to the art world by helping to organize the Arts Student League in 1875, and co-found the Society of American Artists in 1887 which provided primary younger classically artists with the opportunity to be a part of an alternative association. Her motivation for starting the organization occurred after she showed one painting at The National Academy of Design's annual show, while she was there as a student. Her painting received a poor location within the show and she felt her paintings location reflected the academy's reluctance to accept new types of art. The goal of the Society of American Artists was to move in a different direction than the National Academy and other conventional artists groups, while showing that art is valid in many different forms and styles, and can be left up to the artist. Along with Gilder, writers including Clarence Cook, Charles de Kay, Richard C. Brown, and her husband Richard Watson Gilder criticized the conservative mindset of the National Academy of Design.  Relationship with Winslow Homer and Mary Hallock Foote  Helena de Kay Gilder is often known as a muse and romantic interest of Winslow Homer. It is thought that Gilder and Winslow may have met through her brother Charles, who had been connected to Winslow since 1867. He had stayed in studio in the University Building in New York City while Winslow was in France at the time. Gilder and Winslow spent a considerable amount of time together, and it is the correspondence through letters that have given indication that Winslow made multiple attempts to romantically pursue her. Though Homer is known to have painted several women in upscale resorts across the Northeast, Gilder is known to be one of the few that is nameable. Gilder is known to be the female subject in many of his works like The Butterfly (1872), as well as speculated to be the subject of other unconfirmed works by Homer. One of Gilder's best known friendships was will illustrator Mary Hallock Foote. Though from very different social circles, and socioeconomic backgrounds, the two became close friends while they were students, and shared a lengthy correspondence throughout their lives. Gilder and Foote had large impacts on each other's careers as they both provided each other with critiques and feedback on their work, and Gilder's husband offered Foote several artistic commissions for his magazine. It was also through the Gilders that Foote was introduced to several other female artists and publishers at the time. Helena de Kay Gilder died on May 28, 1916.

The WFSA‚Äôs Secretariat is based in London, UK. The WFSA is the foremost global alliance of anaesthesiologists, and through a federation of 135 Member Societies, unites anaesthesiologists from 145 countries around the world to improve patient care and access to safe anaesthesia and perioperative medicine. Every four years the WFSA and a Member Society host the World Congress of Anaesthesiologists, with the next to be held in Prague in 2020. The WFSA is a Non-State Actor in Official Liaison with the World Health Organization and has consultative status with UN-ECOSOC. The WFSA is founding member of the G4 Alliance, and a founder and supporter of Lifebox. In 2018, the WFSA published the WHO-WFSA International Standards for a Safe Practice of Anesthesia alongside the World Health Organization for the first time, published jointly in the Canadian Journal of Anesthesia and Anesthesia & Analgesia. These Standards are applicable to all anaesthesia providers throughout the world. They are intended to provide guidance and assistance to anaesthesia providers, their professional organisations, hospital and facility administrators, and governments for maintaining and improving the quality and safety of anaesthesia care. The WFSA Global Anesthesia Workforce Survey, published in September 2017 in Anesthesia & Analgesia, was a workforce survey conducted during 2015 and 2016. The aim of the survey was to collect detailed information on physician anaesthesia provider (PAP) and non-physician anaesthesia provider (NPAP) numbers, distribution, and training. Seventy-seven countries reported a PAP density of <5, with particularly low densities in the African and South-East Asia regions. NPAPs make up a large part of the global anaesthesia workforce, especially in countries with limited resources. Even when NPAPs are included, 70 countries had a total anaesthesia provider density of <5 per 100,000. Using current population data, over 136,000 additional PAPs would be needed immediately to achieve a minimum density of 5 per 100,000 population in all countries. Following the publication of the Survey, the WFSA published an easy-to-use WFSA Workforce Map on their website, an ongoing open source project to map the global anaesthesia workforce. The WFSA publishes the peer reviewed Anaesthesia Tutorial of the Week every two weeks, which is an online open access educational resource with the aim of supporting anaesthesia training throughout the world, particularly in areas where access to journals and learning material is limited. The WFSA‚Äôs official academic journal is Update in Anaesthesia. The WFSA offers Fellowship Training Programmes for young anaesthetists from low income countries around the world. Currently there are 52 Fellowships across Latin America, Asia, Europe, Africa and Pan- Arab, and North America. The WFSA also offers Scholarships, with support from Baxter, Masimo, Laerdal Foundation, Gradian, and Diamedica, for young anaesthetists on low incomes and working in less affluent countries to attend WFSA World and Regional Congresses. The WFSA delivers courses and training programmes to strengthen the global capacity for safe anaesthesia and pain management. These training programmes include Safer Anaesthesia From Education (SAFE) Courses, developed by the WFSA and the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI), and Essential Pain Management. The WFSA co-ordinates the Palestinian Anaesthesia Teaching Mission (PATM) which enables volunteers to provide targeted teaching to anaesthesiologists and clinicians across hospitals in Palestine. The WFSA is partnered with the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) to offer qualified anaesthetists/intensivists from Kenya, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Malawi and Nepal, who are in good standing with their National Society, the opportunity to enhance their skills and knowledge in the UK through the RCoA‚Äôs Medical Training Initiative (MTI) scheme.

It allowed pupils of both genders in 1929, and was dissolved in 1974.

[With Illustrations.] Already in 1793, Jakob Tengstr√∂m in √Öbo Tidningar had criticized the schools for girls in Finland for being shallow and useless, and called for them to be given a more useful education. At that point, the only schools open to females were temporary schools managed by single women who educated upper class students in various accomplishments, such as French and music, with the purpose of becoming \\"ladies\\", wives and mothers, such as those of Christina Krook, Anna Salmberg and Sara Wacklin. This debate resulted in the decision that girls should be included in the reform of the school system in 1843 and in the following year the Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors was founded in Helsinki and the Svenska fruntimmersskolan i √Öbo in √Öbo. The Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors was a pioneer institution.Siegberg, Arthur: Den h√∂gre kvinnobildningen i Finland, dess utveckling och m√•l., W. C. Fabritius & Sonner, Kr.a.

He won the race even though someone stepped on one of his racing spikes early in the race, causing him to run the rest of the race missing one shoe. Two years later, he ran the men's 1500 meters at the 1979 European Indoor Championships, finishing second to last in his heat in a time of 3:48.2. At the 1981 Summer Universiade, he ran a personal best of 3:39.83 in the men's 1500 meters, finishing second overall behind Sa√Ød Aouita. He was only the third person from Yugoslavia to have ever run under 3:40 in the 1500 meters, after Bo≈°ko Bo≈æinoviƒá and Dragan Zdravkoviƒá.

According to Cardinal Leo Marsicanus, the 11th-century historian of the Abbey of Monte Cassino, a monk of Monte Cassino named Monecaus served as provost in a \\"cell\\" (cella) dedicated to Saint James in the Tremiti Islands during the abbacy of Bertharius (856‚Äì83). Leo reports that in his day many charters from the time of Monecaus were still in the archives of Monte Cassino. For some reason, Leo later erased this information from his chronicle. None of the charters he mentions survive. In 883, a band of Saracens sacked Monte Cassino and the monks went into exile for over half a century. This period must have severed relations between it and its provostries, including Tremiti.Herbert Bloch, Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages, Vol. 1 (Harvard University Press, 1986), pp. 689‚Äì94. For a list of abbots and priors, see Armando Petrucci, Codice diplomatico del monastero benedettino di S. Maria di Tremiti, 1005‚Äì1237, 3 vols. (Rome, 1960), pp. CXXXVIII‚ÄìCXLIV. Originally the abbey was dedicated to James the Greater and its associated with the Virgin Mary developed gradually in the early 11th century. The earliest document referring to the abbey on San Nicola is a record of a land-grant of Bishop Landenulf of Lucera dated to November 1005. In it the abbey is called the \\"monastery of the Blessed James the Apostle which is in Tremiti island\\". Mary was associated with the abbey for the first time in a document of 1014, where it is called the \\"church of Saint Mary and Saint James the Apostle which are constructed in the place that is called Tremiti\\". This dual association with James and Mary is a constant in the documentation from 1026 until 1059, although reference to James was dropped in a charter dated to 1023. After 1059 there is no further reference to Saint James. Courtyard of the ruined monastery Abbot Desiderius of Monte Cassino, supported by Duke Robert Guiscard of Apulia, tried to enforce his abbey's old rights over Santa Maria, but in a dramatic series of events in 1071‚Äì73 was forced to back down. In 1081 he formally admitted his sin and acknowledged Santa Maria's independence. The abbot he tried to remove, Ferrus, outlived him and the abbot whose election he engineered, Ungrellus, is never heard of again. Nevertheless, papal privileges continued to list the monastery of Tremiti as a Cassinese possession down to the time of Anastasius IV (1153/4), and an imperial privilege of Lothair II in 1137 did likewise. By the thirteenth century, the abbey of Santa Maria a Mare was in decline. In 1237 it was granted to the Cistercian Order. Sometime between 1334 and 1343 it was reduced to commendatory status. The Canons Regular of the Lateran took over in 1412 and put it under a prior, who was raised to an abbot again in 1482. In the sixteenth century the monastery was renovated, but in the following century it again went into decline. In 1674 the Tremiti Islands were occupied by the Kingdom of Naples. The islands became part of the royal domain in 1737 and the monastery was suppressed by royal decree in 1782. The monastic archives were transferred to the Archivio Grande in Naples. They were lost to fire in 1943 during World War II. The medieval cartulary, however, survives and was published in 1960.

It was also the country's first structure owned by a women's organization. It was built in 1879 by funds raised by the Ladies' Library Association of Kalamazoo (LLA). History The Ladies' Library Association of Kalamazoo was founded in 1852, with the purpose of increasing the education of is members. For the first few decades, the Association had no permanent meeting place, and focused on creating their library. However, in 1878, the association decided to construct a library building. They raised funds, and construction started in 1879. The lot for the building was donated by Ruth Webster, long-time member of the LLA. The building was designed by Chicago architect Henry Lloyd Gay and built by Frederick Bush. A kitchen wing was added in 1913. The building became a Michigan State Historic Site in 1961 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Current status The Ladies Library Association Building is still occupied by the Ladies' Library Association of Kalamazoo. In 2013 the LLA completed restoration of the building which brought the structure to present-day code. In 2015 it received the State History Award in Historic Restoration. Description The Ladies Library Association Building is a two- story red brick building, the original section of which is 30 feet by 60 feet with an attached tower with a footprint of 14 feet by 18 feet. A two-story kitchen wing was later added on the rear of the tower. It is built in the Venetian Gothic Revival style. The building has a slate roof, sits on a granite foundation, and light-colored cut stone trim is used throughout the exterior. Architectural details include ornamental ironwork, decorative tiles, and stained glass windows.

Description A small copepod, the female is generally between , and the male typically between in length. Distribution P. minutus is found primarily in the Arctic, but it is also found in the northwest Atlantic, the northern Pacific, and more temperate waters where Atlantic and Arctic waters are mixed. Ecology Life cycle and reproduction In Toyama Bay, P. minutus reproduces from February to April, producing two generations. This is during the temperature minimum (of about ) and phytoplankton maximum. All stages are found at shallower depths during the night (diel vertical migration) in Toyama Bay during this time. During the annual temperature maximum (of over ) in September, stage V copepodites migrate (possibly gradually) to deeper, colder waters to diapause (in contrast to the congeneric P. newmani, which does not seem to be able to diapause). They moult to adults before January, rising to the surface to breed. In Kongsfjorden, P. minutus reproduces during May and June, producing one generation (consistent with a trend for higher latitude populations to produce less generations). It descends in autumn and winter to depths below as a stage III to stage V copepodite. Females and stage I copepodites are found throughout the water column during November. From June and July till May, younger stages tend to be found towards the surface, and older stages tend to migrate to overwinter earlier. It develops during the winter and reproduces with energy gained from the spring phytoplankton bloom, indicating a one year life cycle. Feeding P. minutus is opportunistic, being mainly herbivorous except during the winter, when it is either carnivorous or omnivorous.

The film is based on the 1986 non-fiction book Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy by Judith C. Brown. The film brings back most of the key crew members of Verhoeven's previous film Elle (which co-starred Efira), including producer Sa√Ød Ben Sa√Ød, writer David Birke, composer Anne Dudley and editor Job ter Burg. The film is scheduled to premiere at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival in competition for the Palme d'Or.  Cast  Production Development Following the critical and commercial success of his previous film Elle (2016), director Paul Verhoeven developed several projects including one about Jesus based on his own book Jesus of Nazareth, another one about the second world war French Resistance, and a third one scripted by Jean-Claude Carri√®re about a medieval story set in a monastery. On 25 April 2017, producer Sa√Ød Ben Sa√Ød revealed that the third had been the one chosen as Verhoeven's next project. The film, then titled Blessed Virgin, marked the producer and the director's second collaboration after Elle. Gerard Soeteman, who has worked with Verhoeven on eight previous films including Turkish Delight (1973), The Fourth Man (1983) and Black Book (2006), replaced Carri√®re to adapt the non-fiction book Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy which was published in 1986 and written by historian Judith C. Brown. Soeteman ultimately distanced himself from the project and had his name removed from the credits as he felt too much of the story was focused on sexuality. Belgian actress Virginie Efira, who played a supporting part as a devout Catholic in Elle, was cast in the leading role of Benedetta Carlini, a 17th-century nun who suffers from disturbing religious and erotic visions. On 25 March 2018, Sa√Ød Ben Sa√Ød announced that Verhoeven had co-written the final draft with David Birke, who previously wrote Elle. Judith C. Brown stated that \\"Paul Verhoeven and David Birke have written an imaginative and spellbinding script that explores the intersection of religion, sexuality, and human ambition in an age of plague and faith.\\" Verhoeven then clarified his intentions: On 3 April 2018, Lambert Wilson told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that he has a role in the film. On 1 May 2018, Deadline Hollywood revealed that Charlotte Rampling entered negotiations to play a key supporting role. On 4 May 2018, it was announced that the film was retitled to Benedetta. Although Verhoeven had hoped to convince Isabelle Huppert to play a supporting role in the film, producer Sa√Ød Ben Sa√Ød stated on 31 May 2018, that the actress was not joining the project. Ben Sa√Ød also confirmed that Louise Chevillotte, Olivier Rabourdin, Clotilde Courau and Herv√© Pierre had been cast in the film. Filming Principal photography began on 19 July 2018 in Montepulciano, Italy. Other locations included Val d'Orcia and Bevagna, also in Italy, as well as the Silvacane Abbey and Le Thoronet Abbey, in France. Production was followed by a strong campaign of secrecy and no one, unless working on the film, were allowed on the set. Producer Sa√Ød Ben Sa√Ød admitted that the story was a \\"subject to controversy\\" and feared reactions from fundamentalist Catholic associations. Release On 16 February 2018, The Hollywood Reporter announced Path√© would be producing and distributing the film in France and would also be handling international sales. On 29 August 2018, Path√© and SBS Productions released a first look image of the film. Although it was initially reported that the film would premiere at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Path√© announced on 14 January 2019 that the release had been postponed until 2020, stating that post-production had been delayed as Verhoeven was recovering from hip surgery. However, the release was delayed again to 2021, following the cancellation of the 2020 edition of the Cannes Film Festival where the film was set to premiere, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 10 May 2020, Cannes director Thierry Fremaux confirmed the film's selection and stated that \\"Paul Verhoeven delivers an erotic and mischievous, also political, vision of the Middle Ages in a grandiose production.\\" On 3 June 2020, Fremaux confirmed the film is scheduled to premiere at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival in competition for the Palme d'Or.

It was Munich where the Nazi Party was founded and where Adolf Hitler's political career began. Munich was where the party newspaper, V√∂lkische Beobachter, and Hitler's Mein Kampf were published. For these reasons, the city was declared the \\"Capital of the movement\\" in 1935 and remained the spiritual capital of Nazi Germany even when Berlin was the political centre. Nazi Germany After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany in January 1933, the Nazis took control in Bavaria on 9 March 1933. They split off the Munich police's political department into a separate entity, the Bavarian Political Police (BPP). The Bavarian Political Police operated outside the framework of the law in the state. The new force experienced no significant staffing changes compared to the pre-Nazi era, with almost all previous staff being either retained or new staff coming from the existing Bavarian police force. The Bavarian Political Police pre-dated its Prussian counterpart, the Gestapo, which was formed on 26 April 1933. In the early stages, the two organisations were rivals, with Hermann G√∂ring controlling the Prussian version and Heinrich Himmler, the Bavarian unit. On 9 March 1933, Adolf Wagner, acting Bavarian minister of the interior, under Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp, appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Metropolitan Police. After the appointment became official by 1 April 1933, Himmler was given the BPP's overall command, with the title of \\"Politischer Polizeikommandeur Bayern. Himmler was now subordinate if only nominally, under Wagner, and had command over all political police in the state. Himmler then appointed his second in command, Reinhard Heydrich, chief of Department IV, the political police. The Bavarian Political Police was given authority above all other police forces in the state and, from 10 April, was authorised to take people into protective custody. In addition, Himmler obtained control over the Nazi concentration camps, the ones already established, and the ones planned. The first major concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933, as local jails were soon at capacity because of the large number of arrests after the Nazis took power. The Bavarian model of control over the police and the newly established concentration camps by the SS became the blueprint for all of Germany. Within a short time, all German state police forces would be organized in the same way. This model was different from Prussia's. Prussia's state government initially retained some control over these entities. Munich became the test site for the future Nazi terror. Staff from the Bavarian Political Police was instrumental in assisting Himmler to take control of the complete German police force. Key members from Bavarian Political Police that would later rise to high ranks within the SS and the Gestapo were Heydrich, Heinrich M√ºller, Josef Albert Meisinger, Reinhard Flesch, Franz Josef Huber, and Edmund Trinkl. In Bavaria, the political police at first only targeted communists and members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, with thousands of people being taken into protective custody. Instrumental in destroying communist resistance in Munich was the informer Max Troll, who denounced over 250 fellow communists to the BPP. From June 1933, this was expanded to non-Nazi members of the national- and state parliaments being arrested, as well as members of the Bavarian People's Party. Eventually, Himmler would gain control of all the police in Germany. On 10 February 1936, a law was passed, allowing the police to act completely independent of the law, free to arrest, deport, torture, and murder people. On 17 June 1936, Adolf Hitler decreed police forces' unification in Germany and named Himmler Chief of German Police, which had previously been controlled through state law. This move gave Himmler operational control over Germany's entire detective and political police. The Bavarian Political Police, now part of the Gestapo, became the Geheime Staatspolizei Staatspolizeileitstelle M√ºnchen, led by Walter Stepp, who had been in charge of the force since 1935. Sepp attempted to retain some independence from the Gestapo headquarters in Berlin and was eventually dismissed in 1937 over the issue. Sepp, in turn, had succeeded Jakob Beck, who led the Bavarian Political Police from April 1934 to February 1935, acting for Heydrich. After integration into the Gestapo, the Bavarian branch was led by Walter Sepp (until 1937), Lothar Beutel (1937‚Äì1939), Erich Isselhorst (1939‚Äì1942) and Oswald Sch√§fer (1942‚Äì1945).

Located on Cherry Street, between Third and Fourth Streets, and founded by John Poor on June 4, 1787, it was chartered on January 7, 1792. It provided young women with a diverse curriculum, notably teaching students about various components of English, science, arithmetic, history, and geography.  Historical context  Founded in the late 18th century, shortly after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War, the academy was established during a period of American history when women were expected to engage in Republican Motherhood. Historians often cite Republican Motherhood as the reason women's education rose to prominence in the early Republic. Due to the idea that women were to educate members of their household on concepts of virtue, access to education for women gained broader support. However, women who embodied Republican Motherhood were restricted in the scope of their education; their learning was supposed to focus on serving home and family, that is, the domestic sphere. Historian Margaret Nash describes access to women's education in the early Republic as a means to spreading knowledge to the greater society as a whole, rather than as an end for women themselves. Benjamin Rush, and many other contemporaries, viewed the academy as an institution established to promote these ideas of Republican Motherhood. Rush believed that women's education ought to be practical for domestic tasks, as well as include traditional academic disciplines such as history and geography. Indeed, in a speech to visitors of the academy, Rush noted that maintaining the wellness of the young Republic and promoting the values of each citizen being equally entitled to liberty \\"make[s] it necessary that our ladies should be qualified to a certain degree by a peculiar and suitable education, to concur in instructing their sons in the principles of liberty and government.\\"Rush, Benjamin. \\"Thoughts on Female Education.\\" Speech, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, July 28, 1787.

History  During and after the American Revolution, Philadelphia was well situated as a location for the school as a significant cultural center in the United States. John Poor, founder and Harvard graduate, was the original principal of the institution. Students came from many different areas of the United States and originally held the understanding that they were \\"scholars\\" and had an opportunity only afforded to the elite. However, daughters of immigrants and less wealthy students attended the school starting around 1794, perhaps to learn skills to be economically self-sufficient rather than to teach members of the household as expected of Republican Motherhood. The school had a board of \\"gentlemen visitors,\\" who presented students with awards based upon their performance in an academic discipline or for good behavior, which was awarded to students who displayed proper manners and a mild temperament. Prizes for excellence fueled the school's competitive nature, which mirrored the atmosphere of boy's academies of the time. No other girl's school was granted a charter until 1829, but the academy served as a precursor to hundreds of academies established widely throughout the Republic. Further reading *Kelley, Mary.

Birn co-authored A Nation on Trial: The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth with Norman Finkelstein. Education and career Ruth Bettina Birn was born in 1952 in Stuttgart, West Germany. In 1985, she received her PhD from the Stuttgart University with the dissertation Die H√∂heren SS-und Polizeif√ºhrer: Himmlers Vertreter im Reich und in den besetzten Gebieten (\\"Higher SS and Police Leaders: Himmler's Representatives in the Reich and the Occupied Territories\\"), published in D√ºsseldorf in 1986 as a book. From 1991 to 2005, she was the chief historian at the War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Section of the Canadian Department of Justice.Profile, Macmillan Publishers Birn studied the Estonian Security Police and SD, publishing a book on this topic, Die Sicherheitspolizei in Estland 1941 ‚Äì 1944: Eine Studie zur Kollaboration im Osten (\\"The Security Police in Estonia 1941 ‚Äì 1944: A Study in Collaboration in the East\\"). Based on hundreds of Security Police investigation files kept in the Estonian State Archives, the book analyzes the persecution policies against various victim groups: Communists, Jews, Roma, Russians, Soviet prisoners of war, and so-called asocials. A Nation on Trial Since the 1970s, Birn conducted research at the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Germany. She was sharply critical of the 1996 book by Daniel Goldhagen, Hitler's Willing Executioners, who she accused of being highly selective with the materials from the Central Office in her article \\"Historiographical review: Revising the Holocaust\\", published in The Historical Journal. Birn's essays were later published in book form as A Nation on Trial: The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth.Shatz, Adam.

Essays by two scholars dissect the work of Daniel Jonah Goldhagen. The New York Times (June 28, 1998) The force of the counterattacks against Birn and Finkelstein from Goldhagen's supporters was described by Israeli journalist Tom Segev as \\"bordering on cultural terrorism ... The Jewish establishment has embraced Goldhagen as if he were Mr Holocaust himself ... All this is absurd, because the criticism of Goldhagen is backed up so well.\\" The historian Hans Mommsen describes Birn's criticism as harsh; he writes that, in an effort to refute Goldhagen's assertion that Jews and Gentiles were treated completely differently by the regime, Birn comes \\"close to obviously unintended apologetics\\". At the same time, he regrets that Goldhagen reacted to Birn's criticism by threatening her and her editor with legal action, thus choosing this route in order \\"to silence his academic critics\\".Hans Mommsen: Einleitung.
