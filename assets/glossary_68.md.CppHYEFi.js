History Founded in February 1990, the Holy Crown Society considers itself as the legal successor of the first Holy Crown Society, existed between 1920 and 1948, the Holy Crown League founded in 1920 and the National Hungarian Holy Crown Alliance established in 1926. The SZKT was founded as a scientific group by historians, heraldists, constitutionalists for studying the Holy Crown of Hungary, its history and legal doctrine. Miklós Kállay de Nagykálló, Jr. (1918–1996), the son of the late Prime Minister Miklós Kállay, was elected President of the Holy Crown Society, while historian and academic István Kállay was appointed Secretary-General. The ultra-conservative Franciscan friar Othmár Faddy and historian Iván Bertényi, Sr. became vice-presidents. After a lengthy debate, the SZKT decided to run in the 1990 parliamentary election and was registered as a party by the Metropolitan Court of Budapest. Its Somogy County branch joined the regional electoral alliance of Somogy County Christian Coalition (SKK). Beside this, the SZKT had two individual candidates in Körmend and Tiszavasvári, who received 0.04 percent of the individual votes.Nohlen, D & Stöver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. Meanwhile, the majority of the SZKT decided to continue the work as a tradition preserving social organization. Because of disputes, the organization split into two factions, when the newly formed Hungarian Holy Crown Alliance quit the SZKT, which dissolved as a party in April 1990.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with complex massing and exterior typical of the Queen Anne period. A projecting bay on the left has a distinctive array of arched windows on the first floor, and a projecting trio of sash windows set in a bracket-supported surround, with a Palladian window in the gable above. The house colors were selected with the assistance of \\"Dr. Color,\\" Bob Buckter, noted San Francisco color consultant, earning it a place in the 1994 book, America's Painted Ladies: The Ultimate Celebration of Our Victorians.\\" The porch has delicate turned posts, in a distinctive tapered shape with flared bases and knobs at the top. The house was designed by the noted Arkansas architect Charles L. Thompson and construction was completed in 1894. The Hemingway House is one of the oldest examples of Thompson's work that is still standing. The property on which the house sits was purchased in 1890 by Wilson E. Hemingway, then serving as a Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, and his wife Helen. Judge Hemingway resigned from the Court in 1893 and entered private practice with U. M. Rose and, his son, George B. Rose, forming what was then called Rose, Hemingway and Rose. Today, it is the Rose Law Firm. Judge Hemingway remained a partner in the firm until his death in 1922. The Hemingway House was sold in the 1920s, falling into disrepair as a boarding house. Its deterioration was halted in 1982, when it was purchased by Mr. Charles Hogan, who meticulously restored the carriage house and the exterior of the main residence, with the help of Witsell, Evans & Rasco, Architects. Work continued on the interior of the house when it was purchased by Scott and Sharon Mosley in 1986. The couple completed the interior restoration and landscaping, living in the residence until 2010. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Nitrification has traditionally thought to be a two- step process, where ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea oxidize ammonia to nitrite and then nitrite-oxidizing bacteria convert to nitrate. Complete conversion of ammonia into nitrate by a single microorganism was first predicted in 2006. Approximately ten years later, the presence of microorganisms that could carry out both conversion processes was discovered within the genus Nitrospira, and the nitrogen cycle was updated. Within the genus Nitrospira, the major ecosystems comammox are primarily found in natural aquifers and engineered ecosystems.  Comammox Nitrospira Bacteria  Complete nitrification of oxidizing ammonia to nitrate is energetically advantageous for Nitrospira. Due to the previous research done on Nitrospira, it was thought that all Nitrospira use nitrite as their energy source. Therefore, comammox Nitrospira were not discovered until 2015. All discovered nitrifiers belong to sublineage II of the genus Nitrospira. The genome of the nitrifying chemilithoautotrophic bacterium from the genus Nitrospira encodes for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation. The genes associated with the growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate are ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenases genes (e.g. amoA gene and hao cluster). This shows that complete nitrifying Nitrospira serve as cornerstones of the nitrogen-cycling microbial communities found in the environment. Nearly two years after the discovery of comammox organisms, Nitrospira inopinata was the first complete nitrifier to be isolated in pure culture. Kinetic and physiological analysis of Nitrospira inopinata demonstrated that this complete nitrifier has a high affinity for ammonia, slow growth rate, low maximum rate of ammonia oxidation, and high yield. The discovery of comammox Nitrospira provides a view into the modular evolution of the nitrogen cycle and expands upon the complexity of the evolutionary history of nitrification.  Ecosystem of Comammox  Comammox have been identified in many ecosystems including natural freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Additionally, the use of engineered ecosystems for comammox could be used for ammonium removal during water and wastewater treatment. Comammox have been found in many engineered systems including aquaculture biofiltration units, drinking water treatment and distribution systems, and wastewater treatment plants. The growth of comammox in these engineered ecosystems co-occur with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and/or archaea, and usually outnumber other ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes. The ecosystem of comammox is currently unknown in terms of biogeography including their distribution and abundance due to the influences of process configuration and chemical composition of the treated wastewater. Following these findings, it was determined that comammox out-select Nitrospira in engineered environments, making comammox the ideal microorganism in use in wastewater treatment processes.

Initially, the party strived for an neutral, independent parliamentary democratic Hungary, but its position changed by 1998, when under the banner \\"Faith, Home, Loyalty\\", the KNP–KD demanded the restoration of the 1000-year-old Kingdom of Hungary. The KNP–KD participated the 1990 parliamentary election with only one candidate, who received 0.01 percent of the individual votes.Nohlen, D & Stöver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. On 11 March 1993 it became a founding member of the Christian National Unity led by the Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party (FKGP). For a short time, the KNP–KD also concluded an alliance with the neo-Nazi Albert Szabó's Party for World-National People's Supremacy (VNP), but also had a good relationship with the Hungarian Legitimist Party (MLGP) and the Hungarian Freedom Party, which split from the Freedom Party (SZP). The KNP–KD withdrew from contest in the 1994 parliamentary election. The KNP–KD abolished in December 1998 and succeeded by the People of the Orient Alliance – Christian National Defence Force (KNSZ–KNV) which, however, never actually functioned due Szent-Tamási's poor health then death.

The recordings originally leaked on January 24, 2006 before eventually being officially released on cassette tape nearly ten years later on December 2, 2015. On January 12, 2016 the songs were made available as a pay what you want digital download. Upon their initial leak in 2006 the tracks were untitled, leading them to be simply referred to by their track listing number. Over the following year, four of the tracks were released, \\"Yeah (Sowing Season)\\" and \\"Luca\\" were reworked and rerecorded for The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me, \\"Fork and Knife\\" was rerecorded and reworked as a standalone single whilst \\"Brother's Song\\" was released as a B-side entitled \\"Brothers\\" and also reworked into another B-side entitled \\"aloC-acoC\\". Over the years, official titles were gradually revealed via setlists for the remaining tracks, before the final track listing was announced in 2015.  Background  In an interview in January 2004, Lacey revealed that he had \\"written a few songs for the next album\\" and that instead of writing solely on an acoustic guitar he had been influenced by bands such as Radiohead and U2 to try experimenting with other instruments. Over the winter of 2004 the band were \\"holed up in a house\\" where they continued writing and recording, and in January 2005 photographer Alexa Lambros posted a number of photographs from the sessions onto her website to much fanfare. With \\"10 or 11 songs\\" recorded for the next album the band decided to take a break. Due to Lacey undergoing surgery in early 2005, the band pursuing personal projects, and a number of deaths within the families of each of the band's members, it wasn't until around June 2005 that Brand New reconvened to continue working together. The band found that the material they were now writing sounded entirely different from the material they had previously recorded in the winter of 2004 for the album, and with the exception of a track known as \\"...YEAH\\" they decided to scrap the previous session in favor of a clean start. Over the following months the band worked in Mike Sapone's basement arranging and demoing tracks before moving to Oxford, Mississippi in September 2005 to work with producer Dennis Herring. Due to time constraints the band had to abandon the sessions with Herring, returning to working with Sapone. Whilst in a hotel in Los Angeles, the band's primary songwriter Jesse Lacey wrote five tracks in an evening of songwriting, two of which were the tracks \\"Brother's Song\\" and \\"Good Man\\". On January 24, 2006 nine unfinished recordings from the 2005 sessions were leaked onto the internet by an unknown source. The leak drew mixed reactions from the band, with Jesse Lacey unhappy, mainly due to the fact the songs were heard prior to being finished, believing the songs to be \\"wasted\\" and that the band couldn't use them on their third album, whilst bassist Garrett Tierney saw it in a more positive light as \\"so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing\\". After scrapping much of the leaked material, the band recommenced writing and recording and would eventually release their album The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me on November 20, 2006. Over the following years the band would discuss the possibility of both rerecording or releasing the leaked recordings on a number of occasions.  Recording and production  The original leak was part of a \\"larger collection of songs\\" that were in various stages of production. Some of the recordings solely featured Lacey performing on an acoustic guitar, whilst others were full band arrangements. For the first official release in 2015 the songs underwent audio restoration, with the band releasing superior quality versions to the original leak. The 2015 cassette tape contains an alternate recording of the track \\"Nobody Moves\\", different to the original leak and its remaster found in the digital download.  Music and influence  The opening track \\"Good Man\\" was written by Lacey about being \\"in love when you're young and out of it when you're old\\". Lacey described the song as being about a girl that had liked him since first grade; not realising he had a school sweetheart until years later when he was 27. For the third track \\"Brother's Song\\", Lacey had been influenced by the writing style of his friend Kevin Devine and looked to try writing about current world events. The track deals with Lacey's fear that one of his brothers would have to go to war, remarking that neither he or his family would \\"let it happen.\\" Lacey later joked at a performance in Santa Ana, California on December 10, 2013 that one of his brothers had \\"screwed the whole thing up\\" after joining the United States Navy. The fourth track \\"Missing You\\" was written by Lacey about his grandfather, a year after his death. The original lyrics for \\"Yeah (Sowing Season)\\" have been described by Lacey as being about \\"losing it all and figuring out how to get it all back.\\" Elaborating on the track, Lacey revealed the track was written about members of his family going off to fight in World War II, specifically his Great Uncle, Leo Lacey. Jesse Lacey revealed that his Great Uncle Leo was an American soldier on a transport ship that was heading for Japan during the Pacific War. After the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the transport he was on returned to America, which led Jesse Lacey to consider the duality of both something great happening in his Great Uncle not being deployed whilst \\"something completely awful [was] happening.\\"  Release  The recordings first leaked on the internet on January 24, 2006, circulating on various peer-to-peer services and file hosting sites. Following the leak four of the tracks would go on to either be reworked or released. Two of the songs were reworked and became tracks on the finished record, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me. \\"Yeah (Sowing Season)\\" (originally leaked as \\"Untitled 08\\") would be reworked into the album's opening song \\"Sowing Season\\", whilst \\"Luca\\" (originally leaked as \\"Untitled 06\\") would also be reworked, appearing as the eighth track on the album, whilst the original version appeared as a bonus track on some editions of the album as a \\"reprisal version.\\" \\"Brother's Song\\" (originally leaked as \\"Untitled #3\\") was reworked and rerecorded into a track titled \\"aloC-acoC\\" for the \\"Sowing Season\\" single, which was released on November 21, 2006, whilst the original version was released under the title \\"Brothers\\" on the \\"Jesus\\" single on April 30, 2007. On October 23, 2007 the band released \\"Fork and Knife\\" (Originally leaked as \\"Untitled 07\\") as a standalone digital single. The song was rerecorded with slightly reworked lyrics and a new bridge section during the sessions for the band's The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me album. In April 2015 it was reported that the band had sent out lyric booklets for their album The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me as part of an unfulfilled offer made nine years previously. Within the booklet, titled Pogolith 000 was a poster alluding to the release of the 2005 session. The band's vocalist and guitarist, Jesse Lacey further discussed how the recordings would \\"soon\\" be released in an interview with Spanish magazine Rockzone in July 2015. Lacey likened them to an \\"abandoned child\\" as well stating that the fact fans were still enjoying the recordings helped the band rescue them. On November 20, 2015, exactly nine years since the release of The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me a number of news outlets reported that Leaked Demos 2006 would be released in December 2015 through the band's own record label, Procrastinate! Music Traitors on limited edition cassette tape. On December 2 the cassettes were made available to purchase exclusively through the Procrastinate! Music Traitors online store, and without any fanfare or announcements from the band the cassettes sold out within the day. The second batch of the cassettes were made available on January 12, 2016. On the same day the songs were also made available as a pay what you want digital download through the Procrastinate! Music Traitors store, as well as being added to music streaming services.  Packaging  The first physical pressing of the songs released on December 2, 2015 was on a red cassette tape. The J-card on the first pressing features five different photographs as well as a thank you note from the band. The front cover is partially made up by an iconic production still from the 1974 film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which depicts Gunnar Hansen's character Leatherface wielding a chainsaw. A picture of a person surfing in the sea also features on the front cover, whilst the photographs of two skulls, two nude women walking, and a photograph of a shark by Pat Bonish complete the card. The retail version released in January 2016 was pressed on black cassette tape. The J-Card is identical with the exception of the front cover, which features a still from the 1973 Spanish horror film Sexy Cat, in the place of the still used from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre from the first pressing.  Performances  With the exception of the reworked versions of \\"Sowing Season\\" and \\"Luca\\", many of the songs have only been sporadically played over the years. \\"Fork & Knife\\" made its live debut on June 20, 2006 at Starland Ballroom, Sayreville, New Jersey. During his solo tour in August 2007, Lacey would often perform \\"Brother's Song\\" and \\"Good Man\\". \\"Nobody Moves\\" debuted live on May 24, 2007 at the Webster Theater, Hartford, Connecticut. \\"Missing You\\" was revealed as the title for \\"Untitled 04\\" when it was debuted live for the first time on October 4, 2014 at The National Theater in Richmond, Virginia. \\"Brother's Song\\" would later be reworked with a full band arrangement for various shows from 2013 onwards.

He was known for his ability to detect emerging market trends, particularly the decline in oil prices that began in 2014, before they otherwise became apparent, through close analysis of data. Before working at the Journal he had worked for Dow Jones overseas, based in its London office.Melanie Grayce West, Body of Missing Wall Street Journal Reporter Found in New Jersey: David Bird disappeared after going for a walk near his home in 2014, Wall Street Journal (March 19, 2015). In early 2014 he left his Millington, New Jersey, home for a short walk and never returned. Local search efforts, hampered by that year's severe winter weather, failed to find any trace of him. Conspiracy theories surfaced, especially after an erroneous report that his credit card had been used overseas, suggesting his disappearance was part of a pattern of suspicious deaths in the financial sector. However, when his body was finally found in a nearby river 14 months later, the coroner ruled his death an accidental drowning and said there were no signs of foul play. A native of the Trenton area, Bird was a graduate of Rider University. In addition to his journalistic work he was an outdoor enthusiast who led Boy Scout hiking trips and ran marathons. He did the latter to raise awareness for organ donation, since his life had been saved by a liver transplant following a hepatitis infection he suffered in the early 2000s. Early life and education Bird was born in Trenton, New Jersey, and was the youngest of six children. After attending a Catholic elementary school in Hamilton Township, where the family lived, he went to Notre Dame High School in nearby Lawrenceville. He graduated from Rider College in 1980. Career Bird worked at the News-Press of Fort Myers, Florida before joining Dow Jones Newswires, and subsequently transferring to Dow Jones's London office. Five years into his career, Bird traveled extensively through Europe and the Middle East, returning to the U.S. in 1988. Bird worked for Dow Jones & Company (the publisher of the Wall Street Journal), for more than twenty years, rising to become deputy managing editor of the Dow Jones Energy Service. He was a key reporter on energy markets. After his death, Journal editor-in-chief Gerard Baker praised Bird's reportorial zeal. \\"His ability to navigate the vast troves of public oil data was unmatched,\\" Baker wrote in a memo to staff. \\"At 10:30 a.m. on Wednesdays, he could often be seen hunched over his computer, sifting through spreadsheets and crunching numbers just released by the Energy Information Administration. He was often the first to gain insight into important energy-market trends.\\" Disappearance Late in the afternoon of January 11, 2014, Bird, who was recovering from a brief stomach illness, left his home in the Millington section of Long Hill Township, New Jersey. He told his wife that he planned to go for a brief walk around nearby wooded trails, clad in a distinctive red raincoat with yellow zippers, jeans and sneakers.Al Baker, Body of David Bird, Missing Wall Street Journal Reporter, Is Found, The New York Times (March 19, 2015). After his return, he said, he intended to take down the family's Christmas lights. He left his cell phone to recharge in his absence. By the evening, however, he had not returned. His wife called the police and reported him missing. Finding him alive was of great importance to the family, since he was required to take anti-rejection drugs due to his liver transplant. Those had been left at the house as well. \\"This wasn't right,\\" his wife said later. \\"Something was wrong.\\" A fellow Boy Scout leader noted that Bird \\"was stuck somewhere, he knows how to shelter himself enough out of the elements. He knows how to signal if he can.\\" Search A few days after Bird disappeared, NBC News reported that his credit card had been used in Mexico. His family, the network claimed, believed his disappearance was not an accident and somehow related to his work. The family, through a friend, said those were not serious investigative leads, just theories being floated by those looking for answers. Later they learned that the card had not, in fact, been used in Mexico after he disappeared; it had instead just been hacked. Later, his wife Nancy called that report \\"a distraction, honestly.\\" Early efforts to search included helicopter patrols by New Jersey State Police, with Morris County park police following up on horseback and all-terrain vehicle while divers searched the nearby Passaic River. Searchers suffered a setback when the winter weather turned colder than usual two weeks later followed by heavy snow throughout the region throughout the next two months; they continued their efforts by retracing their steps along the sides of local roadways, looking for signs of an unreported motor vehicle accident or personal items. In March, when the snow melted, the search resumed, focusing on areas nearby where Bird had been known to hike and retracing earlier routes. In May local police said their goal was to have the entire area within a radius of the Bird home thoroughly searched. Dow Jones offered a $10,000 reward for information on Bird's whereabouts, and colleagues and others raised $35,000 in contributions for Bird's family.Paul Milo, Authorities say David Bird died in accidental drowning, report says, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (June 10, 2015).Kimberly Redmond, Wall Street Journal donating $10k to David Bird's family, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (March 25, 2015).Paul Milo & Justin Zaremba, Reporter David Bird, found dead in river, was 'a mentor, a friend, and a model of integrity' , NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (March 20, 2015). Dow Jones also kept paying Bird's salary through the end of July 2014, changing his status to unpaid leave of absence after that point.Louis C. Hochman, Union donates $10,000 after Wall Street Journal stops paying missing NJ man's salary, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (December 18, 2014). After Bird was taken off the payroll, the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees 1096, the trade union representing Journal reporters, donated $10,000 to the family and matched members' contributions up to another $10,000. Although no new leads had surfaced, on the first anniversary of Bird's disappearance his family and friends led a candlelight vigil and walk through a nearby park where he had often walked, ending in a bonfire, to keep attention on the case. Discovery of body On March 18, 2015, a family website asking for assistance in the search went online. That day, two canoeists on the Passaic, its waters high after another winter of heavy snow and bitter cold, found Bird's red jacket entangled in branches on the Morris County side of a stretch of the river near King George Road in neighboring Somerset County's Warren Township, roughly one mile (1.6 km) from Bird's home. They notified authorities, who found the body about off the shoreline,Justin Zaremba, Funeral of David Bird brings closure 14 months after he disappeared, friends say, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (March 26, 2015) under of water, an area that had been searched before several times. The remains were identified through dental records. A subsequent investigation determined that the cause of death was accidental drowning. His wife believed it was possible that Bird \\"slipped and fell into the water while hurrying home ahead of an incoming storm.\\" Personal life Bird met Nancy Fleming around 1988, and they wed in 1991. The couple had two children, a son born in 1998 and a daughter born in 2001. Bird contracted a rare form of hepatitis about nine years before his disappearance and death and received a lifesaving liver transplant in 2004, which Bird discussed on his blog and which was reported in local newspapers. Bird was an advocate for organ donation. Bird was described in his Wall Street Journal obituary as \\"an avid hiker, lover of reggae music, a Boston Red Sox fan, cyclist, camper, marathoner and a scout-troop leader\\" who had traveled to more than 35 countries. In the last years of his life he had started running marathons. In 2012 he finished the Harrisburg Marathon, followed by the New York City Marathon the next year. He also competed in the New York City Triathlon twice and was a member of Team Liberty at the National Transplant Games. Through his athletic activities he hoped to draw support for organ donation and be an example for other transplant recipients. Running the marathon had particular significance for Bird since he had first learned he would need a transplant to live on the day of the 2004 marathon. He ran the race with a note thanking his donor pinned to him. \\"I met my goal of hitting the finish line in less time than I was in surgery,\\" he said later. Alternative theories Although no signs of foul play were reported in his death, Bird's fate inspired theories that what happened was somehow the result of a conspiracy of some nature that had also claimed other lives in the financial industry during the same period. According to the theory, his disappearance and death were related to a string of suicides and other untimely deaths of present and former JPMorganChase employees in late 2013 and early 2014, supposedly after two of them had uncovered evidence of major wrongdoing on the company's part. In his final column for Bloomberg View, several months after Bird was reported missing, William D. Cohan, a former Chase employee himself who had some admitted disputes with the company, looked into the rumors and found that Chase had indeed experienced an unusual number of deaths of employees in their 30s during that period, especially when compared to similarly-sized investment banks. But, since several of those deaths were indisputably suicides, he concluded that it was just as likely that those deaths were simply the result of working in an already stressful industry during a stressful period.

The school shares facilities with Peterhouse Girls' School on the Springvale Estate of approximately with Gosho Park, a conservation area on the estate, being adjacent to the two schools. The majority of the pupil population are boarders while the remainder are day scholars. Springvale House is a member of the Association of Trust Schools (ATS) and the Headmaster is a member of the Conference of Heads of Independent Schools in Zimbabwe (CHISZ). History Springvale School Springvale School was founded by Rev. Canon Robert Grinham and Maurice Carver, the founders of Ruzawi School, in 1952, as a second Anglican junior boys' school in Marondera. The school was born of the desire to cater for the large number of children on Ruzawi's waiting list which grew to 'epic proportions' in 1945. Canon Grinham fought against the proposal to expand Ruzawi's intake as he felt it would hurt the ethos of the school, thus pushing forward the idea of establishing another preparatory school. In 1949, the Ruzawi Board bought 1000 acres of land for £2 an acre from Jim Blake, the owner of Springvale Farm. In 1950, Canon Grinham left the headship of Ruzawi School to undertake the new project. His first task was to raise funds for building the school and to assemble a Board of Governors. The board included the likes of the Rt Rev Edward Paget, Winston Field, Howard Smetham, Colonel Ralston and Maurice Carver, with the chairman being Sir Robert Hudson. At the first meeting, the Board was advised that the Registrar of Companies had formally registered \\"Springvale Ltd\\" on 2 March 1952. The company was set up under the Anglican Foundation and 100 shares were issued. Patrick Gosho, after whom Gosho Park is named, was Springvale's first employee. Previously, he was an employee of Jim Blake, running the vegetable growing and beef production arm of Springvale Farm. He joined Springvale in 1951. The first boys arrived in May 1952 under the headship of Robert Grinham. The boys were temporarily transferred to Ruzawi then returned to Springvale in August. Canon Grinham retired in 1956. In 1957, John Paterson, the headmaster of St. Andrew's Preparatory School (Grahamstown, South Africa), became the second headmaster of Springvale. He was accompanied by Claude Billington, the school's first chaplain. He oversaw the building of the music block in December 1959 and the establishment of Junior House (a boarding house with classrooms, a dining room and kitchen/laundry facilities, dormitories and a housemaster's residence). The foundation stone for Junior House was laid by Sir Humphrey Gibbs in April 1960. The 1960s saw major infrastructural developments at Springvale School with new tennis courts, a games room, playing fields, staff flats and a reference library being added, as well as the conversion of the old Form I classroom into a science laboratory. rugby was introduced in 1961. John Paterson was elected as chairman of the Conference of Heads of Independent Schools. The Springvale Estate matured along with the school as the developments took place. In 1968, John Paterson retired as headmaster and went to England. He was replaced by Brian Johnson in January 1969. Mr Johnson had taught at Springvale since 1953. The school proudly celebrated its 20th birthday and the Headmaster commented, \\"The first volume in the History of Springvale is now full. The bills for our upbringing have all been paid. Our Old Boys Association is established. Our first old boy's son is on the waiting list. We look forward to a future full of exciting new opportunities for development [and] I am confident that we shall meet an ever increasing need in the Africa of tomorrow.\\" In January 1973, owing to the increasingly unstable political and security situation in Rhodesia, the border was closed and Express Motorways, a coach company, was forbidden to operate in Zambia thus making it difficult to transport Zambian pupils to the school. The number of Zambian pupils began to drop sharply. In the same year, Michael Hammond, a staff member of Springvale left to become headmaster of Eagle School, a preparatory school for boys in Vumba. Eagle School was faced with closure due to the war and the drop in students and as a result the 70 remaining pupils were integrated into Springvale School in the second term of 1976. Despite the influx from Eagle, Springvale was ever prey to the external influences of the political and economic state of the country. Mike Hammond was absorbed into the Peterhouse teaching staff across the road, and Headmaster Brian Johnson retired in 1977 and went to England. Before his departure, Mr Johnson welcomed John Stansbury as the new headmaster of Springvale (he was the head of Whitestone School before its closure in 1975). John Stansbury took over a school whose numbers were declining rapidly. Numbers were down from 150 at the end of 1976 to 102 and dwindled still further in the course of the year. Boys from Zambia and Malawi were being withdrawn as a result of the security situation and by 1979, economic sanctions meant that parents were not permitted to transfer money to pay the school fees. Others were finding places in schools closer to Harare. Despite his dedicated efforts to recruit new pupils, the head was in the unenviable position of having to reduce staff numbers as the school scaled down. The school was desperately in need of financial assistance, and all the fundraising and appeals were simply not enough to keep it viable. Eagle School had brought a debt with them to the school in 1976, which fortunately had been cleared by 1979, but the chief problem was the non-payment of school fees by parents. By 1978 pupil numbers dropped to 50, in 1979 there were just 37 pupils and the school was owed nearly R$20,000 in fees. Many business concerns stepped in to support the school in its most difficult times but the board was forced to close the school at the end of 1979. Hiatus In the hopes that one day the school would reopen, plans were made for its maintenance in the interim. Some equipment was sold off to Peterhouse and to Ruzawi but a great deal of the furniture and fittings, musical instruments, sporting equipment, blankets and linen were put into storage in Junior House. Patrick Gosho moved into the housemaster's flat in Junior House to caretake what remained of the school, which was not confined simply to the school buildings. There was also the large estate to be managed, with its gum tree plantations (which were still economically viable) and St Francis village, the home of the Springvale Estate workers and their families, which had grown up along with the school since the 1950s and had a chapel and a school of its own. In 1979 Mr. John Hammond was the chairman of the Springvale board and also the chairman of St Philip's School in Guruve. This school, run by the Anglican Diocese, was set in the heart of one of the most troubled areas during the war years and the buildings were burned down during a raid. John Hammond arranged for the St Philip's pupils to move into the then vacant Springvale premises and January 1980 saw a complete change of pupils and teaching staff. The Beit Trust and the Anglican Diocese provided finance to pay maintenance and caretaking staff. Peter Bradshaw, who had been a teacher at Springvale School, became the liaison link between the remaining Board and Patrick Gosho, paying the ground staff and assisting whenever he could with maintenance and problem solving. In December 1981, the Springvale Board held a meeting to discuss the reopening of the school and the logistics involved. Proper written notice had been given to St Philip's by the Chairman of the Springvale Board before June 1981 to end the lease on December 31, 1982, but unfortunately, in the words of the then Bishop of Mashonaland, the Right Rev'd Peter Hatendi, who later assumed personal responsibility for St Philip's, \\"the St Philip's board of governors did very little about it and they accepted a new intake in January 1982\\". Problems had arisen in the meantime. The chairman, John Hammond, suffered a heart attack and had to resign. The new board of St Philip's built a day school in Guruve, thus leaving the boarders with nowhere to go and the headmaster at the Springvale arm of St Philip's had admitted Form I and Form II pupils, in contravention of the terms of the lease. Although the Springvale board had kept their side of the agreement, permission to reopen was refused by the Ministry of Education and Culture until the St Philip's pupils could be properly accommodated in a boarding school of their own. There was a perception that the St Philip's senior school pupils were being ousted in favour of a more privileged junior school, and the subsequent furore in the press reflected the acrimonious discussions taking place between the Springvale Board of Governors and the Ministry of Education. By 1983 matters had been resolved, one way or another. Eventually, the Anglican diocese decided to help by building new boarding facilities at Daramombe, a mission school that, like St Philip's, had been closed down during the war. The St Philip's boys could thus be moved en masse and the Anglican diocese expressed their thanks to the Springvale board for permitting St Philip's to stay at Springvale until the Daramombe facilities were ready in the course of 1983. Springvale House Peterhouse, under then Rector Alan Megahey, took over Springvale. In October 1984, Jon Calderwood, headmaster at Hartmann House was appointed headmaster designate. Due to the plans of Dr Megahey, the Main School buildings were given over to Peterhouse, whilst the preparatory school would be based in the Junior House. The school was given a new name, \\"Springvale House Preparatory School\\", to align the school with Peterhouse brand. On the 20th of January 1985, Springvale House was opened with a small gathering celebrating the new term. 93 pupils (boys and girls) in Grades 1-5 were enrolled at the school. Building plans came to fruition as new classrooms, sporting and ablution facilities were built. In 1990, a music room was built in memory of Mark Megahey, the late son of former Peterhouse Rector, Dr Alan Megahey. In 1994, Jon Calderwood became the head of Peterhouse Girls' School and was replaced by Graham Peebles as the head of Springvale House. In 1994-1995, the Art and Computer Centre was built through the efforts of the Parents and Teachers Association, and in 1996-1997, the dining hall was built. Through the donation of Mr Funnekotter, the Springvale House Museum was built. Plans to enlarge the Chapel of St Francis (made as early as 1997, spearheaded by Jon Calderwood) came to fruition in 2001 when two wings were added, thus creating the shape of a crucifix. The construction of the Sports Centre was completed in 2003, a facility in which various indoor sports are undertaken. Emblem The emblem of Springvale is the Jerusalem cross with four additional lines drawn in. The emblem serves to recall that the school was founded on Christian principles. It also brings to mind the four Gospel writers whose work extracts are buried in the original Springvale buildings (now Peterhouse Girls' School). The plain Jerusalem cross was the emblem of Ruzawi and Springvale adopted it in its adapted form because the school was originally known as 'Ruzawi's younger brother'. Cultural activities There are numerous intramural and extramural activities on offer at the school. The activities that were on offer will vary on termly basis. Notable cultural events on the school calendar are the Eisteddfod, National Allied Arts Competitions, Harare Junior School Choir Concert, Music Concert (mid-year), Carol Concert (Third Term) and the Marondera Schools' Carol Concert. Sports There are various sports offered at Springvale House. These include: Athletics, cricket, cross country, football, hockey, netball, rugby, swimming, tennis. Clubs and activities The clubs and activities at Springvale House include: animal care, arts & craft, ballet, boardgames, chess, Christian Club, Connecting Classrooms, dancing, golf, guitar, gymnastics, hockey skills, horse riding, indoor hockey, marimbas, modelling, needlework, orchestra, rowing, squash, table tennis, taekwondo and triathlon. Monitors In 1996, the monitor system was introduced at the school, replacing the traditional prefect system. The aim is to develop the Grade 7 pupils to be leaders under the banner of 'servant leadership'. Chapel of St Francis The chapel was built in the early 1950s and is dedicated to Saint Francis, who so inspired Springvale School’s first headmaster, Canon Robert Grinham.

Though she began her career with the Mennonites, which was the only congregation that allowed female ministers at the time, the majority of her career was spent in the Dutch Protestant Association (NPB). Biography Anne Zernike was born on 30 April 1887 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, to the teachers and mathematicians Antje (née Dieperink) and Carl Friedrich August Zernike. She was raised in a family of intellectuals, including a sister who became a novelist and a brother Fritz who would later win the Nobel Prize for Physics. She completed her primary schooling and attended the High School for Girls on the Keizersgracht. Zernike knew from childhood that she wanted to become a minister and her parents encouraged her to study, though her father did not believe that she would be accepted as a preacher. She began her studies at the University of Amsterdam and because the only denomination which would ordain women was the Mennonite Church, she joined that congregation. Upon completion of her university studies and her baptism at the age of 22, she became eligible to enter the Anabaptist Seminary, and completed her final examinations in 1911. Career Anne Zernike at her ordination, 5 November 1911 On 5 November 1911 in the Frisian town of Bovenknijpe (near Heerenveen), Zernike was ordained and preached her sermon on Jeremiah 31. She found it difficult to adjust to life in Bovenknijpe and was homesick for culture until she met the painter, Jan Mankes. After a brief courtship, they became engaged and married on 30 September 1915. Shortly thereafter, the couple moved to The Hague where their lives focused on participation in the artistic environment, including literature, painting and poetry; theology, including explorations of Christian Socialism, Taoism and theosophy; and the principals of pacifism and vegetarianism. During this period, Zernike, as was expected at the time, gave up her career for her husband's employment opportunities. As Jan's tuberculosis worsened and a doctor counseled that they relocate away from the damp of the sea and to a forested area, the couple moved in 1917 to Eerbeek. Shortly after they arrived, Zernike discovered she was pregnant and began working on her thesis which she titled, On historical materialism and social democratic ethics. Beint, their son was born on 1 March 1918 and that same autumn, she received her doctorate in divinity from the University of Amsterdam under the direction of Professor H. IJ Groenewegen. Jan succumbed to his illness on 23 April 1920 and Zernike left Eerbeek for Rotterdam the following year. Zernike returned to the ministry but not with the Anabaptists, as she felt a greater affinity with a more liberal and newly formed church belonging to the Dutch Protestant Association (NPB). There was no building, the 40 church members met in the school gymnasium, and she was given free rein to design the services as she felt led. Thus, she formed a choir and a theater, the congregation visited museums regularly and were apt to discuss Bible verses based on an analysis of paintings by Rembrandt or other artists. By 1929, the congregation had grown and they needed a new space. Joining forces with the Dutch Reformed Church, Lutherans, Mennonites, and Remonstrants, Zernike's congregation formed the Liberal Christian Youth Centre () (VCJC) and built a church, which they all shared on the riverbank of the Jagerslaan. They called the church the New Covenant and instead of a pulpit, it had a stage in the center of the sanctuary. Under her leadership, the congregation grew to nearly 500 members. She retired from preaching in 1948 but continued writing on theological issues. She published her memoirs in 1956 and remained active throughout the 1960s. Zernike died on 6 March 1972 in Amersfoort, The Netherlands and was buried with her husband in Eerbeek.

Plot In 1916, childhood best friends, Bob Wilson (Ben Lyon) and Fred von Bergen (James Bush), are test pilots working for an American company that builds bombers for the European allies. Since he is German-born and faces prejudice against his heritage, Fred loses his job and, unable to find other employment, decides to return to Germany to fight for his homeland. Although he has no special attachment to the German cause, Bob quits the aviation company and joins his friend in Germany. On their way to a German airfield, Red Cross nurse Alida Hoffman (Sari Maritza) accidentally runs Bob and Fred off the road, Both men are immediately drawn to Alida, especially Bob although Fred is more shy. After Bob's first unsuccessful mission, Captain Wolters (Erich von Stroheim), the squadron's tyrannical leader, expresses his doubt about his loyalty but, desperate for pilots, gives him another chance. As the United States is drawn into the war, instead of sending him into a crucial air battle, Wolters arrests Bob. Fred, heartbroken that Alida has chosen Bob, quarrels with his friend, calling him a coward. Later, however, Fred allows his friend to escape from a firing squad and flee to the Allied lines. To prove his allegiance, Bob leads British bombers to the German base, while Fred is told by Wolters that he must shoot down Bob to prove his loyalty. Neither man is capable of killing the other, and, in the end, Fred sacrifices his life for Bob. After the war, Bob returns to Germany to marry Alida. The newly married couple then returns to the United States, and pay their respects to Fred's mother. Cast * Ben Lyon as Bob Wilson * Sari Maritza as Alida Hoffman * Erich von Stroheim as Capt.

Co-produced by primary recording artist Matt Mondanile and Rob Schnapf, the album features contributions from Julia Holter and her bandmates, Chris Votek and Andrew Tholl. Influenced by Mondanile's decision to move from Brooklyn, New York to Los Angeles, California, St. Catherine features more personal lyrical content than previous Ducktails releases. Background and recording The album was recorded between October 2013 and January 2015 in three cities; Los Angeles, Berlin and New York City, with primary recording artist Matt Mondanile noting: \\"It’s the longest I’ve spent on a record, and I moved to LA when I started it. I started demoing in 2013 in the fall, and then Real Estate’s record came out in March of 2014, so I started touring a lot and would work on it slowly over time. I was traveling a lot, and I’d just moved here, and I was taking my time with it and listening to a lot of the demos.\\" During the recording of St. Catherine, Mondanile was joined by producer Rob Schnapf in its final stages: \\"Rob helped mix it. When you work with someone else, you do what they think is best for the record. It's also nice to have your own input, but from a different place, I guess. I learned a little bit about mixing a record from Robb. He's just a good guy.\\" Writing and composition Regarding the album's lyrical content, Mondanile noted: \\"I was more interested in writing about actual things in my life. I wanted to be more specific with the songs, and write about something. Instead of the past, [where] it was more abstract.\\" The album and its title track are named after Catherine of Alexandria: \\"She's kind of like the Patron Saint of Knowledge and Virtue. Her story is that she saved herself for Jesus Christ, and she wouldn't sleep with anyone except for [him]. She saves her body for Jesus, and [that's] very interesting to me, for someone to devote their life to that. The song's about [being] satisfied with what you have and nothing else. You're kind of lost in the dream; or lost in the fantasy.\\" Reception In a mostly positive review for Pitchfork, Zach Kelly wrote: \\"This is Ducktails’ most discriminating and tasteful album, but the project is at its best when there's a certain amount of exploration even within its narrow parameters.\\" In another mostly positive review, Spins Harley Brown wrote: \\"St. Catherine lacks the homespun production that made Ducktails’ earlier recordings so charming, but it’s still some of the most lovely indie rock music that exists today.\\" Track listing Personnel Musicians *Matt Mondanile *James Ferraro *Ross Chait *Julia Holter *Andrew Tholl *Chris Votek *Josh da Costa *Alex Craig *Luka Usmiani String arrangements *Andrew Tholl *Chris Votek Production *Rob Schnapf - producer, mixing *Drew Fischer - engineer *Matt Mondanile - producer *Al Carlson - engineer *Simon Berckelman - engineer Artwork *Rob Carmichael - design *Rob Kulisek - back cover photo References 2015 albums Ducktails (band) albums Domino Recording Company albums ","title":"St. Catherine (album)"},{"id":"48710268","text":"Trickle Dickle Down is a 2012 American animated short film directed by Ralph Bakshi.Ain't It Cool NewsAnimation MagazineBleeding CoolGeeks of Doom The film incorporates animation from Bakshi's 1975 film Coonskin with newly recorded voice-overs.

He described the monster as \\"A fish with a black head like an ox and larger than a whale\\" (Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita, 1676) and Antonio de Alcedo, 1788 Antonio Alcedo, 1789, Diccionario geográfico- histórico de las Indias Occidentales ó América Tomo V, S. 187, citation= pez grande - accessed 02-05-2016)).

King Charles II of Spain and the Indies, in which Chapter I, paragraph 13, contains the following statements of a monstrous being on Lake Tota: When referring to a sighting, an additional citation brings certainty to the matter:  19th century   Gaspard Théodore Mollien  The French explorer and diplomat Gaspard Théodore Mollien (Paris, August 29, 1796 - Nice, June 28, 1872), recorded in his book The Journey of Gaspard Théodore Mollien by the Republic of Colombia in 1823, in Chapter V, the following:  Manuel Ancízar  Manuel Ancízar (1812–1882) In 1852, Colombian writer, politician, teacher and journalist Manuel Ancízar (Fontibon, December 25, 1812 - Bogota, May 21, 1882); within the works led by Agustin Codazzi, carried out the Corográfica Commission and recorded in his book The Pilgrimage Alpha for the northern provinces of New Granada in 1850-1851 (Alpha was the pseudonym of Ancízar), a reference to the diabloballena monster of Lake Tota that cited Piedrahita's General History of the Conquest of the New Kingdom of Granada: the SCRM d.King Charles II of Spain and the Indians, in Chapter XXIV, paragraph 5: In the end, Ancízar declared, without discrediting the monster referred to by Piedrahita or exposing any evidence, his doubts about the accuracy of the monster and began to raise his initiative to practice draining Lake Tota to increase the agricultural frontier. He ends the paragraph in reference by stating:  José Jerónimo Triana  José Jerónimo Triana (1828–1890) Meanwhile, Colombian botanist, explorer and physician José Jerónimo Triana (Bogota, May 22, 1828 - Paris, October 31, 1890), a member of the Corográfica Commission of Ancízar, also references the issue. A summary of the book Myths, legends, traditions and folklore of Lake Tota (Lilia Montaña de Silva, Edition La Rana y El Águila, UPTC Tunja, 1970, p. 46-47) states: Additional notes on this part: A concrete reference to the \\"black monster\\" of Lake Tota:  Muisca ancestral conception  Destruction of Leviathan, depiction by Gustave Doré, 1865 When discussing the issue of the monster of Lake Tota in regards to Muisca ancestry, it must be placed in the context of their respective culture. This culture was independent, as advanced as the better known Inca and Maya civilizations and very different from the colonial thought that arrived with the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th century.  From the Muisca language  Mariana Escribano, a doctorate in Literature, History and Semiotics from the Paris-Sorbonne University and a scientific linguist and expert in the Muisca language - said: The monster of Lake Tota could be an archetypal divine animal that was associated as a dragon.  The mythical origin of Lake Tota  Stories of the mythical origin of Lake Tota mention that “Monetá\\", the wise old indigenous priest, was preparing the \\"already extensive and powerful Muisca Confederation\\" to \\"exorcise the cruel and evil spirit, Busiraco\\" in the ancient cavity that now forms Lake Tota. Here's mention of the monstrous animal that lived there: The ceremony spell against Busiraco aimed at resolving the suffering of summer and water shortages, led to the creation of Lake Tota; the monster is also mentioned as a snake, when he was fatally attacked: Monument of Bochica in the municipality Cuitiva (Boyacá) The \\"black snake\\" and the creation of the lake:  See also  * Nahuelito * Brosno dragon * Lake Tota  References   External links  * Monstruo del Lago de Tota - the ONG Fundación Montecito as a representative of the area (Lake Tota and its basin) - accessed 02-05-2016 * Related interviews on W Radio, Colombia, W Fin de Semana programme, date 28 October 2012: # To: Adrian Shine, Scotland, about Nessie or the Loch Ness Monster # To: Felipe Andrés Velasco, Colombia, about diablo ballena or the Monster of Lake Tota Colombian folklore Indigenous South American legendary creatures Legendary fish Muisca mythology and religion Tota Spanish-language South American legendary creatures Water monsters ","title":"Monster of Lake Tota"},{"id":"48710293","text":"This tournament is an annual pre-season football tournament for teams from the Icelandic men's premier division (Úrvalsdeild karla).https://int.soccerway.com/national/iceland/reykjavik- cup/c1228/archive/?ICID=PL_3N_05 Groups Group A Group B Semifinals Final References Football in Iceland ","title":"2016 Reykjavik Tournament"},{"id":"48710320","text":"Avenue Jean-Capelle Jean Capelle (16 March 1909 – 29 May 1983) was a French politician and advocate of Living Latin.The Classical Journal 1957 - Page 119 \\"The idea of the Congress was born in the mind of M.

Built in 1891 as a reunion site for veterans of the American Civil War 8th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, it is a fine example of Shingle style architecture, and an important work of the local architectural firm of Fasset and Tompson. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, and presently operates as a summer lodge and museum, with rooms rented to the public. Description and history The Eighth Maine Memorial is located on the south coast of Peaks Island, a large island at the southeastern edge of Casco Bay east of downtown Portland. It is a large two-story rectangular structure, with a gabled roof whose sides are punctuated by large cross gables. The main roof extends down to the first floor, where it transitions into the roof of a porch that wraps around the entire structure. The walls are finished in a combination of clapboards, wooden and vinyl shingles, and asphalt shingles. The building rests on a fieldstone foundation that slopes down toward the shore, exposing part of the basement. At one corner an octagonal three-story tower rises. The building interior is organized with public spaces on the ground floor, kitchen and service facilities in the basement, and living quarters on the second floor. The memorial was erected in 1891 for the use of the 8th Maine Regiment Association, a fraternal society of American Civil War veterans who had served in the 8th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Its construction was funded in large part by Colonel William M. McArthur, who won $70,000 in a lottery run by Confederate Army General P.G.T. Beauregard to raise funds for the reconstruction of Louisiana after the war. The building was designed by the Portland firm of Fasset and Tompson, a prolific team who had also designed the nearby Fifth Maine Regiment Hall. The hall was used for annual reunions until 1936, the last year one of the original veterans attended. The building continues to be owned by the association, and continues to be used by the descendants of the 8th's members. Rooms are rented to the public on a space- available basis.

Todorović won the 2011 NCAA Division I competition with University of California Bruins. She was fourth in the 2013 FIVB U23 World Championship. With the Filipino club Philips Gold Lady Slammers she won the bronze medal in the 2015 Philippine Super Liga Grand Prix conference and the Second Best Outside Spiker individual award. Personal life Todorović was born on October 28, 1991 in Belgrade. She recalled her childhood influenced by the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War and the sirens she used to hear in the playground and spending quality family time while taking shelter underground. Her family moved to Long Beach, California when she was nine years old. Her parents are Dusan and Maja Todorović, who played club volleyball and introduced her to the sport. She has an older brother named Dimitrije. She is tall . She speaks Serbian, English and Spanish. She graduated from University High School (Irvine, California) and went to University of California, Los Angeles graduating in Economics. She enrolled herself in the California State University, Long Beach graduate school to pursue a Master's degree in Sport management and Eastern European History. Todorović has been praised for having a beautiful look while playing in France and the Philippines.As of August 2020, Todorović had reportedly been dating Kirby Ruiz. Todorović is also a professional model. Career Todorović practiced karate for a year before shes started with volleyball at the age of seven in Belgrade. Playing with University High School, Todorović was All-City every year, including CIF championship in her first year, All- City Most Valuable Player in her last year and a Fab 50 selection from Volleyball Magazine. With the Laguna Beach club, she won the third place in the 2007 and 2009 Junior National Championship and was selected among the All- Tournament Team in 2008 and 2009. She spent her playing career in college for the University of California Bruins as an outside spiker in her first two years, then defensive specialist and libero in her final year and spent one year playing sand volleyball. She was part of the 2011 UCLA Bruins champion team during the 2011 NCAA Division I competition. In her rookie year, she was part of the 2009 All-Pac-10 Freshman team. She won the 2010 USAV IDQ #3 beach volleyball tournament, partnering Tara Roenicke earning a spont in the United States U19 Beach Volleyball Team, but was unable to compete with the team because she was not American citizen yet.

It brings UK physicists and engineers together with companies and entrepreneurs who have an interest in commercialising the technology. The \\"second quantum revolution\\" The \\"second quantum revolution\\", or \\"quantum 2.0\\" is a term that is often used to describe quantum technologies based on superposition and entanglement. Originally described in a 1997 book by Gerard J. Milburn, which was then followed by a 2003 article by Jonathan P. Dowling and Gerard J. Milburn, as well as a 2003 article by David Deutsch. These technologies use equipment such as highly stabilised laser systems, magneto-optical traps, cryogenic cooled solid state devices, ion traps and vacuum systems to create, manipulate and then use quantum effects for a number of different purposes. These include: quantum information processing, such as quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum secure communications, quantum sensing and metrology and quantum imaging, and are widely believed to offer capabilities that will out-perform existing and future classical technologies. Vision The vision of the UK National Quantum Technologies programme is to \\"create a coherent government, industry and academic quantum technology community that gives the UK a world-leading position in the emerging multi- billion-pound new quantum technology markets, and to substantially enhance the value of some of the biggest UK-based industries.\\" History The UKNQTP was initiated by a £270 million investment by the UK Chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne in the Autumn Statement 2013. In addition to this, the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) separately announced a £30 million investment into a programme to produce demonstrator devices. Organisation and governance The primary focus of the UKNQTP are four 'hubs' for quantum technologies : *Quantum Hub for sensors and metrology, led by the University of Birmingham *Quantum Communications Hub, led by the University of York *NQIT: Quantum hub for Networked Quantum Information Technologies, led by the University of Oxford *QuantIC: Quantum hub for quantum enhanced imaging, with a central team at the University of Glasgow The UKQTP is advised by the Quantum Technologies Strategic Advisory Board, which is chaired by Professor David Delpy, it also consists of Professor Sir Peter Knight, Baroness Neville-Jones, Professor Gerald Milburn, Professor Ian Walmsley and other leading individuals from industry, academia and public sector. The programme is delivered by several UK public bodies: UK government Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), EPSRC, Innovate UK, Dstl, NPL, CESG and the Knowledge Transfer Network. Press coverage The UKQTP has received some attention from the UK media, with an interview with Professor Miles Padgett on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on 11 November 2015 and articles in New Scientist, and Nature materials Key milestones and achievements * Summer 2013 - Dstl, after consultation with the academic community publish a UK Quantum Technologies Landscape document, which outlines a number of areas of research that are ready to become devices for defence and commercial use. * Autumn 2013 - The UK Chancellor George Osborne announces a £270 million investment into quantum technologies * November 2014 - The Science Minister at the time, Greg Clark announces a \\"national network of quantum technology hubs\\" * March 2015 - The Quantum Technologies Strategic Advisory Board release their strategy for the UKNQTP * April 2015 - Innovate UK announces the results the competition 'exploring the commercial applications of quantum technologies', a £5 million funding round for companies working to develop quantum technologies.

Built in 1854, the mill was operated by a single family for over a century, and was converted to a museum in 1967. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Dexter Grist Mill is located in Dexter's village center, adjacent to a central parking lot located behind commercial buildings fronting on Main and Spring Streets. The mill complex includes two buildings, the main mill and the miller's house. The mill is a wood frame structure measuring about , its main section two stories in height, with variety of additions. Its exterior is finished in a combination of wooden shingles and clapboards, and it rests on a foundation of piers, some brick and some stone. Its main entrance is on the north side, where a porch shelters double doors. The interior retains early 20th-century machinery, although the main water wheel that provided their power has been removed. The mill was built in 1854, although it is set on a site that had been used for milling since the early 19th century. The miller's house stands just south of the mill. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style structure, five bays wide, with a central chimney and clapboard and shingle siding. Built in 1838, it has Greek Revival style, with the entrance framed by sidelights and pilasters, with an entablatured lintel above. The first mill in Dexter was started about 1801 by Samuel Elkins, at a point north of this mill's location, on the shore of Lake Wassookeag, which provided its power. The mill property was purchased in 1817 by Jonathan Farrar, who enlarged that mill's lumber capacity, and established a new grist mill at the present site. To provide power, he dug a mill pond and canal. In 1854 Farrar built the present gristmill on the site, in partnership with a man named Cutler. Farrar and Cutler hired James Quimby Maxwell to run the mill, and it is Maxwell's descendants who eventually bought the mill, and continued to operate and update it until its final closure in 1966. It was then acquired by the town, and deed to the local historical society for use as a museum. The mill is one of a few surviving mid-19th- century mills in the state.

Her story is part of the Scotland-Malawi partnership and the strong relationship between the two countries, providing service for the under-serviced hospitals in Mulanje and Ekwendi. Mantell was best known for her significant contribution to the development of the Ekwendeni Nurses' Training School in Malawi, practicing holistic care, and being one of the pioneering female medical missionaries of the latter 20th Century.  Early life  Elizabeth Mantell was born on 24 June 1941 in Kasama, Rhodesia (Present-day Zambia). Her father, Henry Percy Mantell, was of English and Welsh background and worked for the African Lakes Corporation. During his second marriage to Barbara Ann \\"Bannie\\" Lyall from Macduff, Elizabeth and two other siblings were born- Harry (1939) and Helen (1944). Mantell's family frequently travelled and changed places of residence due to her father's work. During World War II the family travelled to Scotland, then returned to Zambia a few months later. After her father's retirement in 1951, Mantell and her family settled back in Scotland for much of her childhood. She was not an innate scholar, but did have a passion for hockey and always wanted to be a nurse as a young girl. She was a member of Macduff Girl Guides, sparking her love for the outdoors and gaining skills for her future endeavours in Malawi.  Education  During her first trip to Scotland, Mantell completed a year in Macduff Infant School. Upon returning to Zambia, Mantell's formally began her education as a student in her mother's home- school in Abercorn which grew to have about 20 students. After moving back to Scotland, Mantell was later enrolled at Macduff Primary School and Banff Academy. She later studied at St Colm's College in Edinburgh, the Church of Scotland's missionary training college, where she obtained the knowledge appropriate for being a missionary in Africa.  Career  On 1 August 1960 Mantell began her nursing career at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary where she became a state registered nurse. In the next year Mantell qualified as a midwife at Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital in London. When caring for her mother in Macduff in 1971, Mantell worked as District Nurse in Macduff, Banff, and the surrounding area. After further study, Mantell qualified as a Clinical Tutor in Midwifery and earned her community nursing qualification. She used this nursing knowledge when focusing her profession on missionary work. Church involvement Mantell focused a large part of her life on her religion and the Macduff Parish Church, an organization of Protestant denomination. Mantell was a very active member of the church, and her faith was a very important part of her life. During her time at the Church of Scotland, Mantell took on the leadership role of ordination to eldership of Kirk Session, served as representative elder to Buchan Presbytery, and led teen Bible classes. Additionally, during her missionary service Mantell was a part of the Nurses' Christian Fellowship. This was a prime example of the importance of holistic care to Mantell, as the group taught girls to appreciate their faith in addition to learning nursing skills.  Personal life  Mantell was never married and had no children. Call to service Mantell's start to missionary service was mainly fuelled by two things: her love for Africa and her self- proclaimed religious calling. After growing up as a young girl in Africa, Mantell had fond memories of her time there and was eager to return to her country of birth. Additionally, she felt the call of God while working in the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, seeing it as her religious duty to aid the sick in Africa. She was accepted to work as a missionary Malawi and in 1966 at the age of 25, Mantell returned to Africa to begin missionary service. Missionary service Work in Mulanje Map of Malawi in relation to Africa Following a semester at St. Colms, in 1966 the Church of Scotland's Overseas Council sent Mantell to Mulanje, a town located in the southern region of Malawi. This area was in desperate need for nurses and had a hospital that was expanded to have multiple wards and over 60 beds. At first Mantell was unsure of the duration of her service remarking in the Evening Express, > \\"I do two years out there for a start. At the moment I don't know if I'll be > staying on longer or not!\\" From 1966 to 1971, Mantell was responsible for about 150 deliveries a month and thousands of women in various clinics. During this time, she served as Midwifery Sister, taught student nurses, and became fluent in Chichewa. Interruption in missionary service Mantell returned to Macduff in 1971 after the death of her father so that she could care for her mother who was becoming increasingly forgetful. Mantell ended up staying in Scotland for 10 years until her mother died in October 1980 at the age of 80. While on her leave of absence, Mantell remained in the missionary and academic circles through her academic talks. These talks included slides, visible in the National Library of Scotland, on her work in Malawi covering schools, church, nurses, and visits to Zomba.National Library of Scotland, Catalogue of Manuscripts, Acc. 13435 Work in Ekwendi During 1983, at the age of 41, Mantell contacted the World Mission department of the Church of Scotland and returned to Africa at Ekwendeni Mission Hospital in northern Malawi. She again worked in the maternity department of a hospital that served an area of 400 miles and a 45,000 person population. Many of Malawi's hospitals were severely understaffed and in need of her missionary work. During her many years as a missionary, Mantell became an active member of CHAM Training Committee, the Nurses Council of Malawi, and the Ministry of Health. In 1986, Mantell was integral in the opening and operating of a new hospital in Ekwendi. In 1991, through Mantell's efforts, the Ekwendeni Training School was upgraded from a school of midwifery to a full training school. Her work slowly evolved from dealing solely with patients to training student nurses as a Midwifery tutor. It was during this time that she developed a two-year course for students- the first year emphasized basic science such as anatomy, physiology, health, and hygiene, while the second year stressed midwifery. Mantell was able to witness Malawian staff earning key positions in the hospital system over time. Death During November 1996, Mantell fell ill due to a tumour, and sought urgent medical care. This would turn out to be a terminal illness, sparking her return to Scotland for chemotherapy treatment at the City Hospital in Edinburgh and the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. Due to her rapidly declining health, Mantell resigned from missionary work and was unable to return to Africa. Mantell died in Scotland on 27 January 1998. Legacy Not only one of the few publicly recognized woman medical missionaries of her time, Mantell also pioneered and practiced holistic care before it was even a term, having concern of both the spiritual and physical when caring for patients. One of Mantell's most significant contributions to healthcare in Malawi was her training of nurses and developing the full Ekwendeni nursing school that still operates to this day. By educating native Malawians and providing a foundation for future education, Mantell was able to create a sustainable way of aiding Africa and helping a great number of people. Today, the Ekwendeni Nursing School grants diplomas in Nursing and Midwifery to students completing three years of school and training. With over 300 students enrolled today, the school produced by Mantell's vision provides an opportunity for employment and increases the number of medically trained staff in Malawi every year. The current mission statement of this school closely aligns with Mantell's principles, Memorial Window of Mantell in Macduff Parish Church > “Ekwendeni College of Nursing through excellence in teaching and learning > environment shall train/educate and inspire students in the nursing and > midwifery profession within the Christian principles.” On 22 April 1998 the Macduff Parish Church dedicated a stained glass window to Mantell. This memorial, designed by Jennifer-Jane Bayless, consists of three windows and the focal point of Mantell holding a baby. Also on the memorial are images of Macduff Parish Church and Mulanje Mission Hospital, as well as the Saltire Cross and Malawi flag. The windows fuse new Celtic and African art. It includes the quote, \\"My grace is sufficient for you\\" from 2 Corinthians 12:9 of the New Testament, representing Mantell's method of practicing missionary work and providing inspiration to the title of her biography by David Randall, Grace Sufficient. Mantell was a key part of the Scotland-Malawi Partnership. Congregations in Scotland remember her mission, raising money in Macduff for things like a well in Ekwendeni. Through efforts like these, the relationship between the two countries are maintained after the death of Elizabeth Mantell.

Documenting the integration effort in the 1950s, he captured the harassment and violence that African Americans in the South were facing at this time. He was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for these photographs. Early life Will Counts was born in Little Rock on August 24, 1931. During the Depression he, his brother, and his parents (Ira Counts Sr. and Jeanne Frances Adams Counts) were sharecroppers in White County, outside the town of Rose Bud and in Lonoke County, outside of Cabot, before they relocated in 1936 to the Plum Bayou Homesteads, a New Deal project, in Jefferson County. Later, the family returned to Little Rock where Counts attended Little Rock High School (now Central High). It was there that his journalism teacher, Edna Middlebrook, spurred his interest in photography. During his junior year, Counts asked his mother for a Speed Graphic camera for Christmas after he had seen one advertised in Boys' Life magazine. 27 Oct. 2015. However, with his father still away fighting in World War II, his mother could only afford to buy a Kodak Brownie Hawkeye. Education By the time Counts started at Arkansas State Teachers College (now the University of Central Arkansas) in 1949, he knew he wanted to be a news journalist. He eventually became a photographer for the college. Around the same time, he was freelancing for the Arkansas Gazette and the Arkansas Democrat. In 1952, he received a BA in education. In 1954, he received his master's degree in education and audio-visual communications at Indiana University (IU). Fifteen years later, Counts earned his doctorate in education at IU. Career While pursuing his master's degree in Bloomington, Indiana, he was production supervisor at the IU audiovisual center. In 1957, he moved back to Little Rock and was rehired by the Democrat as a staff photographer and editor of its Sunday magazine. Counts was 26 when some of his most iconic images were published on September 4, 1957. Still a photographer for the Democrat, Counts captured white demonstrators and the National Guard gathering outside Central High. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that \\"separate but equal\\" was unconstitutional, Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus had called the Guard to block integration. One of Counts’ most famous images captures African-American Elizabeth Eckford being harassed by an angry white mob of students after being denied entrance at Central High. He recalled Eckford never losing her composure. \\"She just remained so dignified, so determined in what she was doing,\\" he said. That photo, and four others that Counts shot on that day, were published on the front page of the Democrat. In his 1999 book, A Life is More Than a Moment, Counts details how he captured the shot. He states that he wore an inconspicuous red shirt and slacks while shooting to blend in with the crowd as a way to avoid looking like a journalist. He also notes that on his Nikon S2 camera, he used a wide-angled lens that gave him an advantage over other photographers. Others typically shot with large Speed Graphic press cameras that involved reloading the camera after each individual shot. Counts also shot many exposures to ensure a winning shot. His heavy bracketing approach was greatly inspired by Henri Cartier-Bresson who often shot many photographs of the same scene to ensure capturing the best representative shot. Eckford and Hazel Bryan Massery, one of the white students captured screaming at Eckford in one of Counts’ iconic photos, met in 1997 when a reconciliation was organized by Counts and his wife, Vivian. Only a few weeks after the famous photograph of Elizabeth Eckford was taken, Counts photographed black journalist Alex Wilson, a reporter for the Memphis-based Tri-State Defender, being kicked in the face by a brick-wielding white man while a crowd watched. This image, too, was captured in front of Central High School. The image shows Wilson doubled over, yet he clutches his hat in one hand. Wilson, later the editor of the Defender, told Counts that the hat was \\"the only piece of dignity I had.\\" The mob trailed Wilson for a block and continued kicking him when he was down. Counts wrote in a story accompanying the photo that Wilson wanted to retain his dignity, and refused to fight back. Counts's picture made the front page of newspapers across the nation; it moved President Dwight Eisenhower, the next day, to federalize the Arkansas National Guard and send 1,000 members of the Army's 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to ensure the school would be desegregated. Hired in 1963, Counts taught photojournalism at Indiana University for 32 years. During this time, a period of explosive growth in Indiana's journalism department, Counts earned his doctorate and became Encyclopædia Britannica's expert on photojournalism. In 1999, Counts published A Life is More Than a Moment. The title came from a line spoken to him by Hazel Massery, the same girl who is seen snarling and shouting at Elizabeth Eckford in his iconic 1957 photograph. Massery stated that she \\"deeply regretted the photograph for she had become the poster child of the hate generation.\\" She apologized to Eckford years later and for a short time the two became friends. Counts died of cancer in Bloomington, Indiana in 2001. Accomplishments The Associated Press and the Arkansas Democrat nominated Counts's images captured at Central High School for the 1957 Pulitzer Prize in news photography, and the Pulitzer Prize photography jury unanimously accepted his nomination, but the jury was overruled by the overall board since three Pulitzers had already been awarded for Little Rock coverage. Counts won a first place award by the National Press Photographer's Association and first place in the spot news category for the fifteenth annual \\"News Picture of the Year Competition\\" for his photo of Alex Wilson. The image was also selected by the Encyclopædia Britannica as one of the world's fifty most memorable news photos in the last fifty years. The photograph was said to have led President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas to protect African Americans during the integration effort. Counts went on to work for the Associated Press. He developed some of the most renowned photojournalism departments in the United States and, in 1996, he was inducted in the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame. Personal life Counts and his wife, Vivian, lived in Bloomington. They had four children.

A product recall covering more than one dozen states and over 155,000 products has taken place as a result of the incident.  Cases Nineteen cases of E. coli were linked to the outbreak, across seven states, primarily in the western half of the United States. Of these reported cases, five resulted in hospitalization, with two patients developing hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure; no deaths occurred as a result of the outbreak. This outbreak was therefore the second largest to occur in the U.S. in 2015, behind the far more severe Chipotle outbreak, which totaled about sixty cases. Locations affected A total of 19 cases of E. coli linked to the outbreak were reported, throughout seven states: California, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Recalls of Costco rotisserie chicken salad, which was deemed the source of the outbreak, occurred throughout the entire United States, with Costco claiming to have removed all infected products by November 20, 2015.  Epidemiology  The epidemiologic evidence collected during the outbreak suggested that rotisserie chicken salad made and sold in Costco Wholesale stores in several states was the likely source of the outbreak.

Older brother Major Edward C. Mears also of the US army. Mears was principal engineer of the Alaska Railroad. Mears took advanced engineering courses at the Infantry and Cavalry School, located at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and became a cavalry officer in the US Army. Panama Canal In May 1906, Mears went to work relocating portions of the Panama Railroad. In 1907, Mears received a promotion to first lieutenant. That same year he married Jennifer (also known as Jennie, Jane, or Johnnie) Wainwright at Fort Clark, Texas. having been next in authority to General Goethals in the work of constructing the canal. Together they went back to Panama and started their family. Alaska Railroad In April 1914, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Mears to the Alaska Engineering Commission. With Mears’s help Ship Creek’s tent city was moved and transformed in the town of Anchorage with 4000 permanent residents. World War I When World War I broke out and Mears left Alaska and returned to Leavenworth to where he organized and took command of the United States Army Thirty-first Railway Engineers regiment. He then went on to France to build the railroad system for the Allied forces. After World War I, Colonel Mears and his family returned to Alaska; he was appointed Chief Engineer to help complete the railroad. Leaving Army and Alaska On July 7, 1923 Colonel Mears resigned from the Army and the Alaska Engineering Commission and, with his family, left Anchorage for Seattle to start with the Great Northern Railroad. In civilian life Frederick Mears continued his association with the Great Northern Railroad. His crowning achievement as an engineer and project manager was the Great Northern Railroad Cascade Tunnel under Stevens Pass in Washington State. The 7.9 mile long tunnel was completed in 36 months and the dedication on January 12, 1929, was a nation wide radio media event. The event was broadcast over a coast-to-coast network of NBC stations – a radio network established on December 28, just two weeks prior to the Cascade Tunnel broadcast. Colonel Mears died on 1939 January 11 at the age of 60 at King Washington from pneumonia.  Early life  He spent virtually all of his formative years immersed in Army life as his father spent 31 years in the military. At 15 years old, Mears enrolled at Shattuck Military Academy, Faribault, Minnesota; the same institution his father had attended. Upon graduating from Shattuck in 1897, Mears wanted to continue his father’s tradition by becoming a cavalry officer in the US Army. Legacy The US Army honored Frederick Mears’ service in Alaska by dedicating one of its posts in his memory during World War II. Fort Mears was built on Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands during the summer of 1941. At its peak, the number of troops stationed at Fort Mears reached 10,000 people. tribute to Colonel Mears can be found at the site of the Tanana River Bridge on the Alaska Railroad which when built under the management of Col Mears was the longest single span bridge in North America at 702 ft.

On November 30, 2006, Durian became the fourth typhoon equivalent to a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale to strike the Philippine island of Luzon, having earlier brushed the offshore Catanduanes. The storm crossed the country, but damage was heaviest in southeastern Luzon, particularly around the Mayon Volcano in the Bicol region. Intense rainfall affecting the volcano, estimated at around 600 mm (24 in), caused deadly lahars, or volcanic landslides. Six nearby villages were nearly destroyed, with thousands of homes washed away in minutes. Background The northwestern Pacific Ocean is the most active tropical cyclone basin in the world, with a 50-year average of 26 (±5) tropical storms developing across the region in a given year. The Bicol region, where Durian first struck, is located at the southeastern portion of the Philippine island of Luzon, and is affected by an average of 8.4 tropical cyclones per year. Typhoon Durian formed as a tropical depression on November 24 near Chuuk State and moved generally west-northwest, becoming a tropical storm two days later. Favorable environmental conditions enabled the system to rapidly intensify on its approach to the Philippines. On November 28, Durian entered the area of responsibility of PAGASA - the Philippines' weather bureau - who gave the local name Reming to the storm. Durian reached its peak strength with ten- minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a barometric pressure of 915 mbar (hPa; 27.02 inHg) on November 29 before striking the Philippines, striking northern Catanduanes and later Camarines Sur in southeastern Luzon. Durian was the fourth typhoon equivalent to a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale to strike the island of Luzon in 2006. Continuing westward, Durian weakened over the archipelago and struck northern Mindoro on December 1. That day, Durian emerged into the South China Sea as a minimal typhoon. On December 5, the storm struck Vietnam south of Ho Chi Minh City. Durian quickly weakened to a tropical depression thereafter and continued westward over the Gulf of Thailand, and eventually dissipated over the Bay of Bengal. Preparations Satellite image of Durian over the Philippines on November 30 Before Durian made its damaging landfall in the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued various tropical cyclone warnings and watches, including Public Storm Warning Signal #4 for Catanduanes, Albay, and both Camarines Sur and Norte provinces; this was the highest warning signal, in which winds of over 100 km/h (60 mph) were expected. The Philippines' National Disaster Coordinating Council issued severe weather bulletins and advisories, and overall, 25 provinces in the archipelago were placed on storm alert. Residents in warning areas were advised of the potential for storm surge, flash flooding, and landslides. The severe threat of the typhoon prompted over 1.3 million people to evacuate their homes, many of whom stayed in the 909 storm shelters. Officials advised residents in low-lying areas to seek higher grounds. School classes in Sorsogon and in Northern and Eastern Samar were suspended, and many buildings opened up as storm shelters. In Naga City, about 1,500 citizens left for emergency shelters. 1,000 were evacuated elsewhere in the region, including 120 in the capital city of Manila and more than 800 in Legazpi City. The threat of the typhoon caused ferry, bus, and airline services to be canceled, stranding thousands of people for several days. All shipping traffic was halted in the Mimaropa region. The Philippine Coast Guard grounded all vessels on open waters, stranding around 4,000 ferry passengers in Quezon province. PAGASA turned off its weather radar in Virac to prevent damage. Impact Precipitation map of Durian from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Typhoon Durian affected about 3.5 million people in the Philippines, of whom about 120,000 were left homeless. Durian damaged 588,037 houses, including 228,436 that were destroyed, many of which were made out of wood. Across the country, the storm wrecked 5,685 schools, estimated at US$63.5 million in damage. The Bicol Region accounted for 79% of the damaged schools, affecting around 357,400 children. Damage was estimated at ₱5.45 billion (PHP, US$110 million). As of December 27, 2006, the death toll stood at 734, with 762 missing. The International Disaster Database listed 1,399 deaths in the Philippines related to Durian, making it the second deadliest natural disaster in 2006 after an earthquake in Indonesia. While crossing the Philippines, Durian dropped of rainfall at Legazpi, Albay in 24 hours, including an hourly total of . The 24 hour total was the highest in 40 years for a station in the Bicol region. Gusts were estimated as high as . The worst of the storm effects were in Albay, Camarines Sur, Cataduanes, Mindoro, and Quezon. The storm damaged coconut plantations, with all of the trees in Bacagay wrecked, affecting the livelihood of half of the residents. Overall, about of rice fields were destroyed, accounting for 65,481 metric tons of corn; 19,420 metric tons of rice were also damaged. However, the crops were already harvested, so the storm's agriculture effects were minor. The storm also wrecked 1,200 fishing boats, severely affecting the local fishing industry, and killed many livestock. Heavy rainfall caused rivers and irrigation canals to exceed their banks. Many creeks and small streams were flooded in the Bicol region. Mayon Volcano Map of Legazpi within Albay province, in relation to Mayon Volcano The eye of Durian passed near Mayon Volcano as it struck the Bicol region. In the mountainous region, a process known as orographic lift produced heavier rainfall than near the coast, with totals possibly as high as 600 mm (24 in). On November 30, the rainfall became very heavy and prolonged, saturating the soil. Lahars - a type of landslide originating from a volcanic ash - formed quickly along the southern and eastern rims of Mayon Volcano, which had produced a fresh layer of ash in August 2006. The lahars destroyed dykes and dams meant to contain the debris flow, which were not designed to prevent major landslides. Warnings were issued for potential lahars, but the rapid development of the debris flows as well as power outages meant populations did not receive adequate warning. Initially, the lahars were contained by a layer of grasslands, although the unstable nature of the volcanic soil caused the grounds to collapse. Within 21 minutes, the lahars descended Mayon Volcano, quickly covering and wrecking six communities. After the initial series of lahars, further ash flow descended to the ocean to the north of Mayon Volcano. North of Legazpi, the ash flow covered or damaged portions of the Pan-Philippine Highway. In the small barangay - small town - of Maipon, nearby streams coalesced into a valley filled with muddy waters. The landslide arrived quickly and washed away or destroyed houses in the path. Several people died while attempting to cross to higher grounds. Similar conditions affected nearby Daraga, where 149 people died. Around that city, the landslide reached deep and wide, enough to cover 3 story buildings, while floods enlarged the nearby Yawa River by 600%. About 13,000 families had to leave their homes due to the landslides. In Albay province alone, there were 604 deaths and 1,465 people who sustained injuries. Damage in the province totaled $71 million (USD). The storm also damaged 702 of the 704 schools in the province. Aftermath View of Mayon Volcano from December 2006, which caused deadly landslides that killed thousands On December 3, 2006, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared a state of national calamity, due to the successive impacts of typhoons Xangsane, Cimaron, and Durian. The 39th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific/World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee met in Manila, Philippines from December 4-9, soon after the onslaught of the floods from Durian. The committee's regional director stated in their report, \\"I wish to extend WMO’s sincere condolences and sympathy to your Government and to the Philippine people who were adversely affected by the past typhoons.\\" During the session, the committee retired the name Durian, which was replaced by Mangkhut in 2008. PAGASA also retired the local name \\"Reming\\" in 2006 and replaced it with \\"Ruby\\". After the successive impacts of Xangsane and Durian caused widespread power outages, the Bicol region lost about $250 million in economic output. The unemployment rate in the Bicol region rose to about 30%, and many who retained their jobs earned less than before the storm. In the aftermath of Durian, all relief activities were coordinated through the Philippines' departments of Health and Social Welfare and Development. A fleet of over 200 vehicles transported relief supplies - food, construction materials, clothing, and medicine - to the Bicol region on December 12\\\\. The Philippine Air Force airlifted supplies and medical teams to Bicol and offshore Catanduanes, with the National Disaster Coordinating Council supplying 17,350 sacks of rice to those areas. The Departments of Social Welfare and Development and the Department of Health sent teams to help victims cope with stress and consoled the families of the deceased, aided by psychiatrists. The Department of Health also distributed tents and sleeping bags, provided vaccines to people in evacuation camps, and ensured proper burial of storm casualties. There was a minor outbreak of diarrhea in the evacuation camps that affected 142 people in Legazpi, and other evacuees were also ailed by the cold, coughing, and fever. Local governments in Albay worked to ensure areas retained clean water by using disinfectants and temporary latrines. The Philippine government provided ₱119 million (US$2.4 million) toward rebuilding the damaged schools in Albay, only 23% of the required cost to repair all of the schools. The government assessed that about 35% of those who lost their houses had the resources to rebuild without assistance; this meant that 144,692 houses had to be rebuilt. Many of the storm victims left homeless resided in tent camps, schools, and temporary shelters, until more permanent buildings were built. The Red Cross housed about 60,000 people across ten provinces in temporary shelters. The Philippine government planned to quickly build more permanent homes, although there were difficulties in securing land and materials for the new housing. By March 2007, government and international agencies only provided 6.9% of the necessary homes, forcing people to stay in shelters longer than expected. By a year after the storm, over 10,000 families still stayed in transit camps in Albay and Camarines Sur. Various organizations helped the homeless secure housing. The government of Italy funded a ₱26 million (US$525,000) project to rebuild 180 houses in Albay. The Italian government also helped build new livelihood centers to provide jobs, provided new boats, and donated about 80,000 coconut seeds to replant trees. In the eight months after Durian struck, the Philippine National Red Cross, in conjunction with the International Red Cross, delivered building supplies to about 12,000 families to repair their homes or build new ones. The organizations encouraged residents to rebuild houses away from vulnerable areas. The International Organization for Migration, in conjunction with the United States Agency for International Development, built 907 homes and new community centers. The Philippine government released ₱76 million ($1.5 million) in funds to build 1,089 houses. UNICEF provided emergency funding to rebuild 50 daycare centers that were damaged by the typhoon. Habitat for Humanity helped repair about 1,200 homes, build about 2,000 new houses, and rebuilt four schools in Sorsogon. Around Mayon Volcano, officials enacted search and rescue missions for victims affected by landslides. Workers quickly excavated lahar-filled valleys, bridges, and river beds to rebuild dykes. Farmers quickly regrew damaged crops, while schools and homes were cleaned and rebuilt. Stronger concrete dykes were built around populated communities. The government developed relocation plans for three landslide- prone areas in Albay. In 2011, the Regional Development Council approved a budget to construct additional dams along the Mayon Volcano to prevent the deadly floods and landslides that occurred during Durian. Dams were scheduled to be constructed around the volcano after a 1981 study, but these were delayed due to budget constraints. International assistance On December 17, the Philippine government issued a $46 million appeal to the United Nations for financial assistance coping with Durian. This was after the country already depleted its yearly emergency funding for disasters. In response, various United Nations' departments provided about $2.6 million in emergency funding, and by late December 2006, 14 countries had provided donations to the Philippines. By the end of January, only 7.1% of the appeal was raised. By the end of April 2007, four Asian countries - China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore - donated ₱54 million (US$2.2 million) worth of emergency supplies, such as clothing, medicine, and food. Various companies and local organizations donated to the relief effort, such as medicine, food, water, transport supplies, clothes, and money. Individuals and corporations donated ₱68 million (US$1.4 million) in cash and supplies. The Red Cross, which responded to the repeated storms of 2006, launched an appeal that raised $9.67 million for the Philippines. In March 2009, the agency completed the missions responding to the 2006 storms and transferred the remaining funds to help repair from Typhoon Fengshen in 2008. The International Organization for Migration developed the Humanitarian Response Monitoring System in response to problems in the management of the aftermath of Durian, and also provided 12,750 metric tons of building supplies, medicine, and water in the storm's immediate aftermath. OXFAM built 242 latrines and 99 bath houses to ensure proper hygiene. The Tzu Chi Foundation set up a temporary medical camp in Tabaco to provide free health care to storm victims. The International Labour Organization built a livelihood center in February 2008 to help provide jobs to storm victims. The World Bank, in conjunction with the Philippines' National Power Corporation, funded a $21.6 million project to repair the damaged power lines in the typhoons' aftermath. The agencies also upgraded 118 electrical towers by 2008 to stabilize power supply during typhoons. As a result, there were minimal power outages during the passage of Tropical Storm Higos (Pablo) in 2008. Beginning in January 2007, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization distributed about 150 packs of vegetable seeds and farm tools to displaced residents in three Bicol provinces, as part of the sustainable recovery program planned by the Philippine government for storm victims. By a year after the typhoon, farmers had regrown their rice and vegetables, utilizing a rebuilt irrigation system. The World Food Programme supplied fishermen with materials to rebuild damaged boats, allowing them to resume catching fish by May 2007. The agency also provided monthly food rations to displaced residents in Albay, totaling 294 tons of rice to about 6,000 families; however, the food distribution programs ended in December 2007, causing food shortages in the first few months of 2008 among those still displaced. UNICEF distributed 1,750 water purification tablets, along with jerrycans and water containers, to ensure access to clean water. Retirement After causing massive damage to the Philippines, the name Reming, along with its international name Durian were removed from their respective lists, and replaced with Ruby and Mangkhut.

They are porous in structure, pores being about 1–2 nanometers in size, and can therefore be targeted to absorb small amounts of matter or toxin. Nanosponges are often used in medicine as targeted drug delivery systems, detoxification methods, or as a way of damage control after an injury. They can also be used in environmental applications to clean up ecosystems by performing tasks like purifying water or metal deposits. Their small size allows them to move quickly through substances, like water or blood, efficiently finding and attacking unwanted matter. Nanosponges are often synthetically manufactured but oftentimes include natural materials to improve their efficiency when injected into the body. Nanosponges are superior to microsponges in application as the smaller size allows less disruption into the system in which it is implemented therefore imposing less risk of failed or detrimental effects. The prefix \\"nano\\" implies that items of this size are measured on a scale of 10^{-9}meters.  History  Nanosponges were first referred to as “cyclodextrin nanosponges” by DeQuan Li and Min Ma in 1998. This term was used because there is a cross-linked β-cyclodextrin with organic diisocyanates. An insoluble network is present in this structure, which shows a high inclusion constant. These polymers are formed through the reaction of native cyclodextrins with a cross-linking agent, the latter influencing the behavior and properties of the entire unit. Cyclodextrin nanosponges were not discovered to have potential in being drug carriers until work done by Trotta and colleagues. They performed syntheses of new kinds of cyclodextrin nanosponges that revealed many potential applications that had not been previously considered.  Mechanisms   Structure  142x142px Cyclodextrins are a class of cyclic glucopyranose oligomers, with common structures of α, β, and γ. α-cyclodextrins comprise six glucopyranose units, β- cyclodextrins comprise seven, and γ comprise eight. Cyclodextrins are biological nanomaterials whose molecular structure greatly influences their supramolecular properties. To synthesize cyclodextrins, enzymatic action occurs on hydrolyzed starch. Cyclodextrin nanosponges are made of a three dimensional cross-linked polymer network. They can be made with α, β, and γ cyclodextrins. The inclusion capacity and the solubilizing capacity of the nanosponges can be tuned according to how much of the cross-linking agent is used.  Functions  Cyclodextrins have a toroidal shape, which allows them to have a cavity inside which can fit other molecules. This useful structure allows them to act as drug carriers in the body, as long as the compounds to be delivered have compatible geometry and polarity with the cavity. To determine when these compounds are delivered, the structure of the cyclodextrin nanosponge can be modified to release its contents sooner or later. Several ligands can be conjugated on the surface of the nanosponge to determine where it will target in the body.  Naturally inspired synthetic nanosponges   Liposomes  When injected into the body, synthetic nanosponges made of liposomes can be coated with leukocytes. These leukocytes can be incorporated in nanoparticles though methods known as the \\"ghost-cell\\" or \\"hitchhiking\\" strategy. Hitchhiking strategy is when nanoparticles are trafficked by living leukocytes. The ghost cell method entails nanoparticles coated in the natural membrane. Since they are coated with leukocytes, the nanosponges will pull towards a location of infection or foreign matter in the body. The nanosponges avoid macrophage attack because they are coated with natural materials. Researchers have only tested these in lab animals but suggest the liposome nanosponge could be easier to get approved by the FDA for in-patient use. Researchers have found promising results in using these nanosponges in drug delivery, relieving inflammation, and repairing damaged tissue.  Coatings (RBC & RBC-PL)  Common pathogens can be toxins that form pores in a cell membrane. These cells target red blood cells. When there are no red blood cells around, these toxins target platelets. Nanorobots with a coating similar to red blood cells and platelets exist, allowing them to be disguised as a red blood cell and/or platelet. These RBC-PL coated nanorobots display efficient propulsion in blood without apparent biofouling. Their movement mimics the movement of natural cells. This ability to blend in enhances their ability to bind to platelet-adhering pathogens. The increased binding ability helps the nanorobots more effectively neutralize toxins because a pathogen that targets these types of cells would be more likely to interact with the nanorobots. This, in turn, increases the amount of collisions and interactions between the nanorobots and the pathogens/toxins. The nanorobots help to absorb and remove the toxins and bacteria. Other functions of these nanorobots are the ability to neutralize cytolytic activity regardless of the molecular structure, enhancing mass transport, and they may also be able to fight auto-immune diseases. Having a natural coating on something synthetic allows the nanorobots to have the benefits of both natural and synthetic materials.  Environmental application   Oil pollution in the ground  Substances like crude oil and tar pollute the ground and are difficult to clean up because of how they stick to dirt and soil. These toxic materials slipping into the soil can cause detrimental health effects to animals and people who consume plants grown in this soil. Current methods of trying to remove these pollutants from hazardous waste sites have proven to be costly and inefficient. Engineers at Cornell University have created a 20 nanometer long particle that can self assemble in water so that its orientation allows for a hydrophilic exterior and hydrophobic interior. These particles are small enough to travel quickly through sand and soil with out getting trapped. The Cornell researchers injected these nanoparticles into the bottom of a steel column filled with sand contaminated by phenanthrene and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), components typically found in tar. They watched as the nanoparticles traveled up the column, cleaning the sand along the way. The hydrophobic cores of the nanosponge drew the phenanthrene off the sand grains and into the interior of the sponge. Researchers intend to one day use this technology to improve upon \\"pump and treat remediation,\\" in which polluted groundwater is pumped up to the surface, cleaned of its pollutants, and then injected back into the ground. With these nanoparticles implemented, pollutants can be more efficiently collected with out getting trapped in the soil. Once cleaned of the toxins they have collected, they can be injected into the soil once more to continue cleaning.  Purification of wastewater  Some nanosponges are made to be eco-friendly and have a high concentration of carboxyl groups. They are used to remove metal deposits in wastewater in the oceans, where organisms can absorb these deposits which leads to detrimental build up in their tissue. The concentration of heavy metals grows while going up the food chain as organisms eat other organisms. Being at the top of the food pyramid, humans are most at risk for the detrimental effects of these metals in our food. These effects include allergic reactions, insomnia, vision problems, and can be as extreme as to cause mental disability, dementia, and kidney disease. Unlike many organic pollutants, heavy metals can be removed and destroyed by using nanomaterials like nanosponges. These nanomaterials act as sustainable filtering materials by binding to metals and removing them from wastewater before they disperse into the ecosystem. Using nanosponges for this results in a higher efficiency and lower cost than alternative cleaning methods like ion exchange resins, activated carbon, or other biological agents. Porous materials produced from renewable and low cost sources, like cellulose, chitin, or starch, are one of the most promising classes of absorbents in terms of effectiveness. Cyclodextrins (CDs) and amylose are derived from starches and are well known for their peculiar structural features and complex properties. The internal cavities in these CDs serve as sites for hydrophobic or very weakly hydrophilic molecules and hence generate a strong affinity to organic molecules at water-solid interfaces. In order to properly bind metal to these CDs, dextrins must be chemically changed by adding an acidic functional group. These functional groups are allowed to undergo deprotonation in an aqueous media so the reaction of these with the hydroxyl groups in dextrin allows negatively charged insoluble polymers to be created . These polymers are known as nanosponges for their porous characteristic; they are able to bond to both organic molecules and metal deposits. After cleaning, these nanosponges can easily be separated from the water through simple filtration since they are insoluble in all solvents. Schematic representation of the synthesis reaction of β-PMDA (a) and β-CITR (b). One type of nanosponge being researched is prepared with β-cyclodextrins and a linear pea starch derivative called linecaps. β-cyclodextrins are used due to low cost and medium-sized pores allowing for a broad range of guest molecules to be collected. Additionally, β-cyclodextrins are favored over dextrin polymers, as they can interact with transition metals also. Primary and secondary hydroxyl groups can act as coordination sites with some metal ions, and CDs can coordinate more than one ion at a time. These two components are reacted with citric acid in water to create the nanosponges using sodium hypophosphate monohydrate as a catalyst for the reaction. These nanosponges were compared to the performance of nanosponges synthesized in the same manner substituting PDMA (pyromellitate substance) for citric acid. A high number of cross-links were introduced into the synthesis process in order to create a maximum amount of carboxyl groups. This allowed for a higher complexation ability of these nanosponges to other molecules. A high degree of cross-linking generally leads to low swellable polymers which are more suited for water treatment, as the water will not take up the space meant for metal waste and can more easily be filtered from water after cleaning. Higher contact time leads to higher efficiency of the cleaning of nanosponges in wastewater. It was found, at high metal concentrations, that pyromellitate was able to absorb more metal deposits. At low concentrations, they both performed nearly identical. However, in the presence of interfering sea water, citrate nanosponges were able to selectively absorb more metal than the PDMA nanosponges, allowing them to be more effective in the cleanup of metal from salt water. Although the research of these citric acid nanosponges is still undergoing revision and development, they show promise for being a sustainable way to clean metal deposits from the ecosystem.  Medical applications   Drug delivery  Nanosponges are being researched to be used for drug delivery systems to treat cancer and infectious diseases. Although nanosponges are one three-thousandth the size of red blood cells, they each can carry thousands of drug molecules. They can hide in the immune system where immune cells try to destroy and remove foreign material from the body. Particles coated with membranes from circulating red blood cells cannot be detected. Additionally, particles coated with membranes from circulating white blood cells or leukocytes avoid attack from macrophages. Major concerns regarding recently developed chemical entities include pharmacokinetic issues, poor solubility in water, and low bioavailability. These lead to obstacles when using conventional drug dosage forms. Nanosponges can conquer these problems as their porous structure allows them the unique capability to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs and release them in a highly predictable manor. These small sponges travel throughout the body until they reach the targeted site where they bind to the surface and perform controlled drug release. Nanosponge technology is widely explored for its use in drug delivery using oral, parenteral, and topical administration techniques.This may include substances such as antineoplastic agents, proteins and peptides, volatile oils, and genetic materials. These small sponges travel throughout the body until they reach the targeted site where they bind to the surface and perform controlled drug release. Potential applications in target site- specific drug delivery include the lungs, spleen, and liver.  Fight antibiotic resistance  Membrane-coated nanosponges could be used to fight antibiotic resistance because they trap and remove toxins from blood. Toxins that attack red blood cells will cling to nanosponges because the sponges are coated with living cells. The sponges absorb the toxins, so they can no longer harm the cells, and the toxins are taken to the liver and broken down.  Detoxification  A study was conducted to determine nanosponges' ability to absorb pore-forming toxins. Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are the most common protein toxins found in nature. They disrupt cells by forming pores in cellular membranes which alter the permeability of the cells. Examples of this include bacterial infections and venom. These venoms all use a pore-forming strategy, in which they create pores in the cells they attack in order for them to leak until they are no longer functional. The idea behind this study was that by limiting PFTs the severity of bacterial infections may be able to be reduced. The study was conducted using a nanosponge (polymeric core) wrapped in a natural red blood cell membrane bilayer so that the bacteria or venom will attack it. The polymeric core stabilizes the membrane shell and the membrane bilayer allows the nanosponge to absorb a wide range of PFTs. Testing was done to determine the ability of the nanosponges to neutralize PFTs. Researchers found that the nanosponge absorbed membrane-damaging toxins and diverted them away from their cellular targets. In mice, the nanosponges significantly reduced the toxicity of staphylococcal α-hemolysin and improved the survival rate. The membrane draped nanoparticles work so that once a toxin has attacked, it is trapped within the scaffolding of the nanosponge. After the nanosponge is full of toxins and cannot trap anymore it moves to the liver to filter out the toxins. Researchers are posed with is how to tackle all the different types of bacteria and venom, making a lot of different nanosponges for each specific bacteria and venom is nearly impossible. As of now they are focusing on toxins such as; E. coli, MRSA, pneumonia, bee venom, snake venom and sea anemone venom. A single nanosponge can capture many of the bacteria and venoms, instead of being tailored to each individually because when the venom physically tried to induce a whole in the red blood cell membrane, the venom will get stuck inside the sponge. An obstacle researchers are faced with is the lifespan of the nanosponges. Once nanosponges are injected they can move rapidly through the blood system, and be found in the liver to be filtered out within hours. This means the nanosponge does not have enough time to soak up the maximum amount of toxin that it can hold. Researchers are working on a technique using hydrogel to coat the nanosponges to increase the life of the nanosponge and help them to remain stationary after injection to more efficiently purge the body of toxins. A study done by The University of California found that 80 percent of nanosponges coated with a hydrogel lasted more than two days after injection. Only 20 percent of nanosponges not coated in the hydrogel lasted two hours after injection, and diffused to other locations in the body.  Treating ischemic strokes  Mn3O4@nanoerythrocyte-T7 (MNET) nanosponges can regulate oxygen and scavenge free radicals in the event of an ischemic stroke, which is a global leading cause of death and disability. These engineered nanosponges can help attenuate hypoxia after a stroke by mimicking red blood cells and increasing the amount of oxygen in the infarct area. This allows for the extension of the survival time of neurocytes, a crucial part of treating an ischemic stroke because their normal functions must be maintained. MNET works because it contains hemoglobin, which allows for there to be an oxygen sponge effect. This effect works by releasing oxygen in hypoxic areas and absorbing it in oxygen-rich areas. The sponge effect, along with the free radical scavenging, can successfully and efficiently treat ischemic strokes. Biomimetic nanoparticles, like MNET nanosponges, can easily pass the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). The efficiency of the BBB-crossing of MNET is improved by the T7 peptide, which is critical in treating an ischemic stroke. In a study on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats, those treated with MNET experienced a significant attenuation of neurological damage.  Safety applications   Explosive detection  Schematic of band structures of metals, semiconductors, quantum dots (QD) and single. Graphic illustrating the change in QD band gap and photoluminescence emission wavelength, or color, with increasing particle size. Properties of nanoparticles can be altered through nanoparticle-ligand systems which are targeted to specific analytes. Electromagnetic properties of nanosponges can be altered by analyte binding to be used as a transducer in chemical sensing systems, specifically for explosive analytes. Sensors based on these properties are intended to detect low concentrations of explosive analytes in both solution and vapor phase based detection. These systems can be built from detection systems from standard components as the signal collected from these transducers is measured with standard scientific instrumentation, allowing this to be a more applicable option of explosive detection. Semiconducting metal oxides are widely considered as the most promising platform for solid-state gas sensors. Due to enhanced responsiveness of conductance to surface effects, various forms of metal oxides that have been nanostructured have been synthesized and their sensing properties studied. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is one electromagnetic property that was examined. In AuNPs, the free electrons within the metal surface will interact with light, which results in large oscillations in the surface electromagnetic field. This results in the particles absorbing light strongly at the particular resonant frequencies of these electrons, promoting SPR bands. In order to use this concept in sensor systems, one must use them in surface enhances Raman spectroscopy (SERS). A Raman spectrum can be used to fingerprint a molecule, using incident light to excite Raman active vibrational modes irreversible scattering of photons. This creates a unique spectrum that can provide information on molecular shape. The spectrum obtained from an unknown analyte can be compared to the library of known spectra to identify any threats. Raman scattering is very weak, making detection difficult to enhancement is required. If a molecule is bound to a metal surface, incident light excites the surface plasmons, inducing polarization in the bound molecules, increasing the amount of irreversible scattered light from the Raman vibrational modes leading to signal enhancement. The best SERS enhancement is achieved by having strong localized plasmons that fall within the wavelength of the Raman laser excitation, which is why gold and silver are often used. With their SPR bands being anywhere from 400 to 800 nanometers, the SPR bands in gold and silver particles are easy to access with visible light. Additionally, they are stable in air as they are chemically inert. The fluorescence of colloidal semiconductors is another property analyzed in creating sensor systems. Quantum dots are semiconducting nanoparticles which are small enough to confine a generated hole-electron pair in all three spatial directions, leading to quantization of the energy levels causing the electronic structure of the material to sit between a classical semiconductor and a classic molecular material. This quantization causes nanoparticles to display sharp photon absorption and emission bands, and the band gap is closely related to the size of the nanoparticle. Fluorescence arises from photoexcitation in these quantum dots and is easily tuned to the visible or near infrared region of the spectrum, by choice of semiconductor material and particle size, making quantum-useful fluorophores. Quantum dots have many properties of interest in order to be used as chemical sensors, including their high fluorescent quantum yields, resistance to photobleaching, and broad absorption allowing for narrow emission bands. They lend themselves nicely to multichannel fluorophore systems, with single excitation wavelength causing emission from many species of many different colors. The surface of these particles can be changed with targeting ligands to allow specific fluorescent enhancement. These optical properties of quantum dots are being exploited to build an explosive sensing array of dots. By combining multichannel fluorophore systems with variable response to different explosives, it is possible to identify different explosives at low concentrations. This technology can be used in wastewater or ground pollution, as well in areas of hazardous waste to identify areas of threat or contaminated substances that could cause health risks to people and animals.  Current primary medical research  Current research is mainly being done for medical application for use of nanosponges in treating bacterial infections (sepsis, pneumonia, and skin and soft tissue infections), viral infections (zika, HIV, and influenza), autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura), and venoms (snakes and other animals). A lot of research is only in its primary stages as implementing these solution to the human body poses many risks for which these applications of nanosponges are not yet developed enough.  Brain injury reduction  Nanosponges have been tested experimentally on mice and have been shown to reduce swelling from brain or head injury. When an injury occurs, tissue in the area of injury will swell and immune cells will race to the damages area. When this injury is in the head, this racing of immune cells will lead to swelling in the brain and can be dangerous because the brain is contained within the cell and therefore there is no place for it to move leading to pressure in the head that can be detrimental. Research suggest nanoparticles can be injected into the head as a way to distract immune cells from rushing to the brain which will reduce swelling. After head injury, mice were left to be for two to three hours and subsequently injected with biodegradable nanoparticles made from an unspecified but FDA approved polymer which is commonly used in some dissolving sutures. Instead of rushing to the head, some immune cells called monocytes ran towards these nanosponges instead of the brain. The monocytes engulfed the nanoparticles and the cells as well as the nanoparticles are then sent to the spleen for elimination in the body. Because the elimination of these particles can happen so fast, researchers were able to inject mice once more two to three days later to combat inflammation that might come back slowly after injury. Mice with this treatment fared better in recovery than those that did not receive this injection and the injured spot reduced to half its size in mice with the nanoparticle treatment. Mice's vision cells performed better in response to light and were able to better walk across a ladder after recovering showing improvement in behavior and motor function. Other potential therapies to treat trauma rely on drugs or other cargo to be sent alongside the nanoparticles however this study was done using bare nanoparticles making it cheaper and safer in trial as less material is injected into the organism. Researchers have not tested this study on human injury. Factors like severity of injury and general recovery time will determine the effects of sending these nanoparticles inside the body. The way the brain suffers involve more bodily reactions that simply this immune response and if accumulation of nanoparticles if not removed from the body fast enough, they may spread to other parts of the body and cause toxic damage.  Macrophage biomimetic nanoparticles for management of sepsis  Currently, sepsis treatments are lacking. Most treatments are just supportive and not effective against fighting the infection. Research that uses nanoparticles that are biomimetic to macrophages. The macrophage coating onto the nanoparticle surface increases the surface to volume ratio of the nanoparticle. This increased ratio is important for efficient endotoxin neutralization. These macrophages act as decoys that can bind to and neutralize endotoxins. Without neutralizing these endotoxins, an immune response would be triggered. These nanoparticles are able to sequester proinflammatory cytokines which inhibit the ability to start a septic response. These have been tested in a mouse Escherichia coli bacteremia model, where the nanoparticles were able to significantly increase the survival of the mice by decreasing the proinflammatory cytokine levels and preventing the bacteria from disseminating. This cannot be replicated in the medical field yet, but it shows promise toward being able to treat sepsis.  Limitations of research  Although research is moving forward, scientists have found some limitations. The use of both natural exterior components with synthetic interior components increases the complexity of development of nanosponges. Low solubility and aqueous instability are leading causes of structural complexity. Additionally, their small size and unique properties at the nanoscale make it difficult to fully extract them out of the body or ecosystem, which could cause increasing amounts of unwanted synthetic material in the environment or in the body. For this reason, it is also hard to conduct human studies. Like any medical research, there is a large range of risk associated with implementing new treatments, as results could potentially be fatal. If nanoparticles are unable to be extracted from the body, the toxicity content could cause internal harm to the patient. The body's rejection of these nanoparticles could also cause an unwanted immunoresponse, which could harm the body more than helping it. For example, Dr. Zhang of the University of California, San Diego suggests that for rheumatoid arthritis, this could elicit an immune response, therefore, not fighting the disease but driving it. If neutrophil membranes are used to coat nanoparticles, they contain autoantigens which causes an immune response.

She has a background in forensics and toxicology. Her blog, SciBabe, is dedicated to \\"clearing up misinformation about science, food and nutrition.\\" She also works to debunk falsehoods in alternative medicine, the anti-vaccination movement, and the anti-GMO (genetically modified organisms) movement.  Biography  D'Entremont was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts and raised in New Hampshire. She currently lives in Oakland. She has bachelor's degrees in theater and chemistry and a master's degree in forensic science. She is a graduate of Emmanuel College, where she was recognized with cum laude honors and distinction in her field. When d'Entremont began to suffer what she described as \\"the worst headache of my life\\", which lasted for eight months before relief, she tried various remedies and attempted different diets, going vegan or all organic. None of these things helped her, and she eventually got the right diagnosis (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) and the right medical treatments for her condition. D'Entremont also suffers from celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder associated with the consumption of gluten. She cites these experiences as her motivation for becoming a blogger and debunking diet myths. D'Entremont has worked for Global Systems Technologies (a DHS contractor), Calloway Labs, and Amvac Chemical Corp in analytical chemistry, and was an adjunct professor at Emmanuel College.  Work  Speaking at the 2017 American Atheists Convention D'Entremont started blogging in 2014. She believes that using \\"snarky humor\\" is an important tool for communicating science and has been influenced by the style of Penn & Teller's show, Bullshit. She began to get wider recognition in April 2015, when her Gawker article about Vani Hari, titled The 'Food Babe' Blogger is Full of Shit went viral. D'Entremont chose the name \\"Science Babe\\" in reaction to Vani Hari's moniker of \\"Food Babe.\\" Since \\"Science Babe\\" had previously been claimed by another scientist, Debbie Berebichez, the name became shortened to \\"SciBabe.\\" In response to criticism concerning the word babe in her nickname, d'Entremont has said it is about helping science seem \\"relatable and sexy.\\" Experienced science communicators have stated that writers like d'Entremont play an important role in educating the public with engaging and accessible scientific information. Pamela Ronald, a biologist at University of California, Davis, applauded d'Entremont's sense of humor. D'Entremont has conducted several \\"stunt\\" tests of homeopathic remedies in order to demonstrate their ineffectiveness or deceptive advertising and labeling. In one event, she drank six bottles of homeopathic remedies sold as \\"CVS Constipation Relief\\" from CVS Pharmacy chains, which had no effect except resulting in her being intoxicated with a blood alcohol content well above the legal limit to drive, as the product contained only 20% alcohol and water. In another demonstration, she created a YouTube video in which she took 50 \\"homeopathic sleeping pills\\" at once, without effect. She is currently working as a contributing writer for The Outline and as a columnist for Self magazine. D'Entremont also co-hosts with Alice Vaughn the podcast Two Girls One Mic: The Porncast, which features humorous commentary about pornography. After three episodes, it was listed in the top 20 comedy podcasts on iTunes. Splenda Collaboration In late 2017, Yvette started to work as a paid spokesperson for Splenda. Since accepting their offer, a series of her blog articles that defend the sweetener have been posted on the official Splenda website.

Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  Zuckerberg and Chan have pledged about $4.6 billion to charities, including a donation of $75 million to San Francisco General Hospital, where Chan worked. In 2013, they gave 18 million Facebook shares (valued at more than $970 million) to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed the couple at the top of its list of 50 most generous American philanthropists for that year. They also pledged $120 million to public schools in the San Francisco Bay Area. On December 1, 2015, Chan and Zuckerberg posted an open Facebook letter to their newborn daughter. They pledged to transfer 99 percent of their Facebook shares, then valued at $45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which is their new limited liability company that focuses on health and education. Chan's charitable goals focus on education, healthcare, and science, which are closely tied to her personal background. She is considered to have had a strong influence on the philanthropy of her husband. She planned to launch The Primary School in 2016, a nonprofit organization that would provide K–12 education as well as prenatal care, in East Palo Alto, California. She was one of six nominated for The San Francisco Chronicle’s third annual Visionary of the Year award in March 2017. The award honors leaders who strive to make the world a better place and also drive change by employing new, innovative business practices.

She was the first woman to join the Greek Archaeological Service; she excavated in Crete, Euboea, Thessaly, and the Argolid, and worked as Curator of ceramic collections at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens for over thirty years. She experienced political persecution under the Greek military junta of 1967-1974. She has been described by the archaeologists Marianna Nikolaidou and Dimitra Kokkinidou as \\"perhaps the most important woman in Greek archaeology\\", and by the newspaper To Vima as \\"the last representative of the generation of great archaeologists\\".Marianna Nikolaidou & Dimitra Kokkinidou (1998), 'Greek women in archaeology: an untold story', in Margarita Díaz- Andreu & Marie Louise Stig Sorensen (eds), Excavating Women: A History of Women in European Archaeology (London/New York: Routledge), pp.235-265. [Donate book to Archive.org]  Early and personal life  Polysemni Papaspyridi, who went by Semni, was born in 1897 in Tripoli, Greece. Her father was a military officer, and her mother the French-educated daughter of a judge; her family moved frequently due to her father's career, finally settling in Athens. She took the name Papaspyridi-Karouzou on her marriage in 1930 to Christos Karouzos (1900–1967), also an archaeologist.  Education and early archaeological career  Karouzou studied archaeology at the University of Athens, where she was taught by the archaeologist Christos Tsountas. She joined the Greek Archaeological Service in 1921 as a curator of antiquities at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, becoming the first woman to do so. Karouzou then worked on excavations at Bronze Age sites at Herakleion, on Crete, and the classical site of Eretria, on Euboea. In 1928, she (along with Christos Karouzos) was awarded a Humboldt Fellowship to study at the universities of Munich and Berlin; when she returned to Greece in 1930 she was promoted to the post of Ephor of Antiquities (head of an ephorate, an archaeological administrative district), an achievement described as a \\"feminist victory\\" by the activist Avra Theodoropoulou. Karouzou held the post in Thessaly and then in the Argolid, where she excavated tombs from the Mycenaean and classical periods; worked in ancient Epidaurus; and worked to preserve historic buildings in the town of Nafplio, where she later published a guide.Semni Karouzou, Το Ναύπλιο [Nafplio]. Εμπορική Τράπεζα της Ελλάδος, 1979.  Curatorial work  In 1933, Karouzou became curator of the ceramic collections at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, a post she held for over thirty years (until 1964). For most of this period women were prohibited from joining the Archaeological Service under a law introduced by the dictator Ioannis Metaxas in 1936, and existing women members were refused promotion to the highest posts as museum directors or ephors. Karouzou's work included reorganising the collections - identifying artefacts which had not been properly catalogued, recording them, and arranging new displayswork which she described as 'invisible service'.Semni Karouzou (1984), Βιώματα και μνημόσυνα (Experiences and memorials), ΗΟΡΟΣ 2.2, pp.1-61: quoted in Nikolaidou & Kokkinidou (1998) She also wrote extensively on the museum's collections of ceramics and stone monuments, as well as on new archaeological discoveries. Her monograph on the Amasis Painter, a major painter of Attic black-figure pottery, was described by a reviewer as \\"a scholarly and valuable study\\". Karouzou's earliest studies on the painter go back to 1931, and she was invited to write her monograph on the painter in 1938. This monograph was published after the war in 1956. On the outbreak of the Greek-Italian war in 1940, Karouzou and her husband (along with other archaeologists, museum guards, and their families) packed away the museum's collections for safety during World War II. Karouzou later recalled that \\"It was with pride for our people that I was assured, in the end of the war when the boxes were opened and the antiquities received, despite [the] fatally insufficient supervision [of the packing process] not a single gold object, no precious gem was missing\\". When Athens was occupied by the German army in 1941, the Karouzous were the only archaeologists in Greece to withdraw their membership of the German Archaeological Institute in protest. After the end of World War II, they were responsible for reinstalling the museum collections, using the catalogues Karouzou had made; this reinstallation was completed in 1947.  Career post-retirement  In 1964, Karouzou turned 67 and was forced to retire from the Archaeological Service due to a new law imposing an age limit on civil servants. Three years later, the Greek military junta came to power, a month after Karouzou's husband died of a heart attack. As a political liberal, Karouzou was labelled a dissident and banned from accessing material in the museum by the junta-appointed General Director of Antiquities, Spyridon Marinatos. Unable to carry out her research on the museum's collectionsa situation which she described as \\"a shameless exclusion from the places of research of unpublished ancient works\\"she secretly left the country by boat to stay at the German Institute in Rome and then in Munich by invitation from colleagues. On her return, she was accused of being a communist and prohibited from leaving the country again. An international outcry arose over this prohibition; a letter written by a group of British archaeologists (including Bernard Ashmole and John Boardman) was published on the front page of The Times.Andrewes, A., et al. \\"A passport refused.\\" The Times, 9 December 1970, p. 11. This led to Karouzou being allowed to leave the country to spend time visiting exiled Greeks in Rome and Lyon and to work as an invited scholar at the universities of Tübingen and Geneva. Following the fall of the junta in 1974, Karouzou was able to return to Greece and become chair of the Greek arm of the 'Lexicon Iconographicarum Mythologicae Classicae' ('Lexicon of the Iconographies of Classical Mythology'). From 1975 to 1977, she was vice president of the Archaeological Society at Athens, and she was made president of the International Congress of Classical Archaeology in 1983. She was awarded honorary doctorates from the Universities of Lyon, Tübingen, and Thessaloniki for her scholarship and contributions to the field. In total, Karouzou published twenty books and over one hundred and twenty articles during the course of her career; she also contributed to public access to archaeology through the publication of guidebooks to the National Archaeological Museum and to archaeological sites. Archaeologists Nikolaidou and Kokkinidou (specialists in the history of Greek archaeology) describe Karouzou as \\"perhaps the most important woman in Greek archaeology\\", and refer to her \\"continuous scholarly effort, broad intellectual perspective, social contribution and democratic sensitivity\\" and the innovative nature of her approach to ancient artefacts, particularly iconography on pottery, by which she \\"moved beyond the images to real people, their everyday life, attitudes and ideologies\\". Karouzou defined her own research methodology as attempting to reveal \\"the invisible meaning of ancient works\\". Karouzou died in December 1994. In its announcement of her death, the Greek newspaper To Vima called her 'the last representative of the generation of great archaeologists'.

Chef Adair told him that he was like Escoffier recreated. and at 16 moved onto Brasserie Le Coze in the same city, which had the same owners as Le Bernardin in New York. Later he moved to New York, where he met famous Mexican chef Enrique Olvera, owner of the restaurant Pujol in Mexico City. García returned to Mexico to work with Olvera for three years. It was during this period that he met his wife Gabriela. In December 2011 the couple opened Máximo Bistrot in the Colonia Roma district of Mexico City, which has since become a magnet for the city's hottest new restaurants. Máximo has since won numerous awards. In 2013 García partnered with Japanese restaurant Rokai in Colonia Cuauhtémoc and created the menus for restaurants De Mar a Mar, Cine Tonalá and Puebla 109. In November 2014, the Garcías opened Lalo!, a restaurant designed to serve his creations at breakfast– and lunchtime at lower prices.\\"Entrevista con el chef Eduardo García\\" (Interview with Chef Eduardo García), TimeOut Mexico, January 2015 The Wall Street Journal characterized García as being known for \\"modernizing Mexico City's food scene with accessible, chic, hyper-seasonal dishes.

Lady PROFECO scandal On April 27, 2013, Andrea Benítez, the daughter of the head of Mexico's Office of the Federal Prosecutor for the Consumer (PROFECO), Humberto Benítez Treviño, was involved in a scandal about abuse of power. Andrea arrived at Máximo Bistrot without a reservation and got into an argument with Gabriela García, demanding to be seated. Gabriela refused, stating that there was a list of people with reservations and she would have to wait. Andrea threw a tantrum, filmed by witnesses and widely circulated in Mexico, and the public gave her the nickname \\"Lady PROFECO\\". Andrea threatened Gabriela to close the restaurant, a power that PROFECO has. Indeed, later the same day, PROFECO inspectors closed the restaurant for what were widely seen as trumped-up reasons. Video of the incident went viral, exposing the Benítez family's abuse of power, resulting in widespread calls for her father to step down. The head of the PRD political party asked for his resignation shortly thereafter. On May 15, 2013, the Secretary of the Interior, Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, dismissed Benítez by order of President Enrique Peña Nieto, considering that the scandal damaged the image of government authority. The scandal and its aftermath represented a small but significant milestone in the fight for transparency in Mexico's political system.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies of her generation in Europe in 1986 when she won four of her seven races. She recorded her first win in the Chesham Stakes before going on to record Group One victories in the Phoenix Stakes, Moyglare Stud Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes. The last of these wins came after the controversial disqualification of Forest Flower. Minstrella failed to win in four attempts as a three-year-old and was retired from racing. She had considerable success as a broodmare in the United States. Minstrella died in 2012 at the age of twenty-eight. Background Minstrella was a \\"robust\\", \\"powerful\\" grey (officially roan) mare with a white blaze and a white sock on her right front foot. She was bred by her owner Edward P \\"Ned\\" Evans who owned the Spring Hill Farm near Casanova, Virginia. She was sired by The Minstrel, a Canadian-bred horse who won The Derby in 1977. As a breeding stallion, The Minstrel was not a spectacular success, but he did sire many good winners including the Breeders' Cup Mile winner Opening Verse, the 1000 Guineas winner Musical Bliss and the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner L'Emigrant as well as Palace Music, who won the Champion Stakes and sired Cigar. Minstrella's dam Flight Dancer won four times as a juvenile in 1970 and was a half-sister to the Jockey Club Stakes winner Dancing Moss. She was also a granddaughter of the leading North American racemare Gallorette. The filly was sent to race in Europe and entered training with Charlie Nelson at Kingsdown Stables at Upper Lambourn in Berkshire. Evans had not previously raced his stock in Europe, and the change of strategy was prompted by the fact that many of his horses had strong European influences in their pedigrees. Racing career 1986: two-year- old season After finishing fourth in a five furlong maiden race in April, Minstrella ran second to Jay Gee Ell in a minor event at York Racecourse in May, starting slowly and racing as though she was unwilling to give her best effort. Despite her moderate form, the filly was then moved up in class and distance and matched against colts in the Chesham Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot in June. Ridden by John Reid she won impressively from Chime Time and Luzum. Minstrella was stepped up again for the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in which she faced the Ian Balding-trained Forest Flower (winner of the Queen Mary Stakes and owned by Ned Evans' cousin Paul Mellon). She took the lead a furlong out but began to swish her tail under pressure and was beaten three quarters of a length by Forest Flower: Timeform noted that she was a filly who \\"had her foibles\\". The Heinz '57' Phoenix Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 10 August was the most valuable race for two-year-olds run in Europe in 1986. Forest Flower started favourite ahead of Polonia (winner of the Railway Stakes) with Minstrella next in the betting on 5/1 alongside Flawless Image, whilst the other runners included the colts Sizzling Melody (Norfolk Stakes), Dominion Royale (Curragh Stakes) and Wiganthorpe. Reid sent Minstrella into the lead in the last quarter mile and held off a strong challenge from Forest Flower to win by a short head, with Polonia a length away in third and Wiganthorpe the best of the colts in fourth. In the York meeting less than two weeks later the form of the race was boosted when Polonia won the Lowther Stakes, whilst the Gimcrack Stakes was won by Wiganthorpe. Minstrella and Polonia met again in the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh on 14 September. Minstrella was made the 9/10 favourite ahead of Polonia on 6/4 with Angel's Share the only one of the other six fillies to start at less than 20/1. Ridden patiently by Reid, she accelerated into the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a half lengths and five lengths from Polonia and Indian Lily. Minstrella's final race of the season saw her face Forest Flower (who had won against colts in the Mill Reef Stakes) for the third time in the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket on 1 October. She started 11/10 favourite ahead of her rival, with the other three runners being Canadian Mill, Shaikiya (runner-up to Sizzling Melody in the Flying Childers Stakes) and Indian Lily. The race proved to be a highly controversial one. Forest Flower seemed to be boxed in two furlongs from the finish, and her rider Tony Ives, in extricating the filly from her unfavourable position, bumped into Minstrella, who was clearly hampered. Minstrella was unable to recover and was beaten two and a half lengths. Reid immediately lodged an objection to the winner, but the racecourse stewards ruled that the interference had been accidental and left the result unaltered. After decision Evans reportedly told Nelson \\"We've been robbed here\\". Minstrella's connections then took their case to the disciplinary committee of the Jockey Club, who overturned the original decision, ruling that Ives's manoeuvre had constituted intentional interference. Minstrella was awarded the race whilst Forest Flower was disqualified and placed last. Timeform described the decision as \\"unjust\\", but pointed out that the committee had acted correctly according to the rules of racing. In 2010 a Racing Post correspondent described the 1986 Cheveley Park Stakes as \\"one of the most controversial Group I races of the last 25 years\\". 1987: three-year-old season Minstrella made her second-season debut in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 30 April for which she started at odds of 15/2 and finished sixth of the fourteen runners behind Miesque. In the Irish 1000 Guineas just over three weeks later she again finished sixth, three and a half lengths behind her old rival Forest Flower. At Royal Ascot in June she was brought back in distance for the Cork and Orrery Stakes over six furlongs and finished fourth to the Irish colt Big Shuffle. After her defeat at Ascot, Minstrella was sent to race in America where she reappeared in the Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes at Keeneland Race Course in October. Racing on Lasix, she finished last of the ten runners behind Graceful Derby. Assessment In 1986, Minstrella was rated the best two-year-old filly to race in Ireland but was only fifth in the European International Classification behind Forest Flower, Miesque, Milligram and Sakura Reiko. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 121, six pounds behind their top juvenile filly Forest Flower. In 1987 Timeform rated her on 120, twelve pounds below their highest rated three-year- old filly Indian Skimmer. Breeding record Minstrella was retired from racing and returned to her birthplace to become a broodmare at her owner's stud in Virginia. She produced at least sixteen foals and eleven winners between 1989 and 2007. She was the dam of three Graded stakes races and the female-line ancestor of three others: *Prospectors Music, a brown colt, foaled in 1989, sired by Mr. Prospector.

Geography The original entrance sign to the raion features Soviet designs. The Chernobyl Raion was located in the northern portion of Kyiv Oblast, at the time an administrative portion of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. To the raion's east, it bordered upon the Kyiv Reservoir; to its south, the Vyshhorod Raion; to its southwest, the Ivankiv Raion; and to its west, the Poliske Raion, significant portions of which also suffered due to the Chernobyl disaster.Map of the pollution in the Chernobyl exclusion zone Today, the territory of the former raion is administratively part of the Ivankiv Raion. Prior to its liquidation, the Chernobyl Raion had an area of and a population of 44,000. The Pripyat River flows through the territory of the former raion before emptying into the Kyiv Reservoir. History The Chornobyl Raion was established in 1923 out of transformation of Chornobyl County (uyezd) within the Kyiv Governorate following an administrative reorganization of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. From its creation in 1923 until 1941, its administrative center was the urban-type settlement of Chernobyl; after 1941, the settlement's status was upgraded to that of a city of district significance. On 16 November 1988, the Chornobyl Raion was liquidated and merged with the Ivankiv Raion based on a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR.Laws of Ukraine. Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR decree No. 6860-XI: Про об'єднання Іванківського і Чорнобильського районів Київської області (On the unification of the Ivankiv and Chernobyl raions of Kiev Oblast). Adopted on 16 November 1988. (Ukrainian) In 1996, the remaining populated settlements of the Chernobyl Raion that weren't evacuated after the disaster were transferred to the Ivankiv Raion's administration. Administrative divisions Overview Before it was liquidated, the Chornobyl Raion had one city council (miskrada) under its administration (the administrative center Chernobyl), and 23 rural councils (silrada), to which 69 villages were subordinated. There was a total of 70 populated places in the raion. The city of Pripyat, which was established in 1970 for workers and families of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, was formerly administratively subordinate to the Chernobyl Raion. In 1980, it was given the status of a city of regional significance, administratively subordinate to the Kyiv Oblast authorities rather than the Chernobyl Raion.

Since its conception in the mid-80's, this artistic practice has assisted in the development of questions surrounding homeland, borders, surveillance, identity, race, ethnicity, and national origin(s). Berlin Wall (1989) Border art as a conceptual artistic practice, however, opens up the possibility for artists to explore similar concerns of identity and national origin(s) but whose location is not specific to the Mexico- United States border. A border can be a division, dividing groups of people and families. Borders can include but are not limited to language, culture, social and economic class, religion, and national identity. In addition to a division, a border can also conceive a borderland area that can create a cohesive community separate from the mainstream cultures and identities portrayed in the communities away from the borders, such as the Tijuana-San Francisco border between Mexico and the United States. Border art can be defined as an art that is created in reference to any number of physical or imagined boundaries. This art can but is not limited to social, political, physical, emotional and/or nationalist issues. Border art is not confined to one particular medium. Border art/artists often address the forced politicization of human bodies and physical land and the arbitrary, yet incredibly harmful, separations that are created by these borders and boundaries. These artists are often \\"border crossers\\" themselves. They may cross borders of traditional art-making (through performance, video, or a combination of mediums). They may at once be artists and activists, existing in multiple social roles at once. Many border artists defy easy classifications in their artistic practice and work. History of border art specific to the Mexico-United States border Ila Nicole Sheren states, \\"Border Art didn't become a category until the Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo (BAW/TAF). Starting in 1984, and continuing in several iterations through the early twenty-first century, the binational collective transformed San Diego-Tijuana into a highly charged site for conceptual performance art ...The BAW/TAF artists were to link performance, site-specificity, and the U.S.-Mexico Border, as well as the first to export \\"border art\\" to other geographic locations and situations.\\" A proponent of Border Art is Guillermo Gómez-Peña, founder of The Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo.Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice. Ed. Gary L. Anderson and Kathryn G. Herr. Vol. 2. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Reference, 2007. p627-628. The Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo pioneered tackling the political tensions of the borderlands, at a time when the region was gaining increased attention from the media due to the NAFTA debates. The contradiction of the border opening to the free flow of capital but simultaneously closing to the flow of immigrants provided the opportunity to address other long-existing conflicts within the region. Antonio Prieto argues that \\"As opposed to folk artists, the new generation belongs to the middle class, has formal training and self-consciously conceives itself as a producer of 'border art.' Moreover, their art is politically charged, and assumes a confrontational stance vis-à-vis both Mexican and U.S. government policies.\\" El muro Tijuana - San Diego In their introduction to the exhibition, La Frontera/The Border: Art About the Mexico/United States Border Experience, Patricio Chávez and Madeleine Grynstejn state, “For the artists represented here, the border is not a physical boundary line separating two sovereign nations, but rather a place of its own, defined by a confluence of cultures that is not geographically bounded either to the north or to the south. The border is the specific nexus of an authentic zone of hybridized cultural experience, reflecting the migration and cross-pollination of ideas and images between different cultures that arise from real and constant human, cultural, and sociopolitical movements. In this decade, borders and international boundaries have become paramount in our national consciousness and in international events. As borders define the economy, political ideology, and national identity of countries throughout the world, so we should examine our own borderlands for an understanding of ourselves and each other.” Prieto notes that “While the first examples of Chicano art in the late sixties took up issues of land, community and oppression, it was not until later that graphic artists like Rupert García began to explicitly depict the border in their work. García's 1973 silkscreen \\"¡Cesen Deportación!,\\" for example, calls for an end to the exploitative treatment of migrant workers who are allowed to cross the border and are then deported at the whim of U.S. economic and political interests.” Prieto notes that for Mexican and Chicano artists, the aesthetics of rascuache created a hybrid of Mexican and American visual culture. While it does not have an exact English translation, the term, rascuache, can be likened to the artistic term, kitsch. It translates most closely from Spanish as \\"leftover\\" with a sensibility closest to the English term, kitsch. Photographer David Taylor focused on the U.S.-Mexico border by following monuments that mark the official borders of the United States and México outlined as a result of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. He quotes on his website, “My travels along the border have been done both alone and in the company of agents. In total, the resulting pictures are intended to offer a view into locations and situations that we generally do not access and portray a highly complex physical, social and political topography during a period of dramatic change.” In his project, Taylor has covered physical borders by documenting the environment and landscape along the border but also addresses social issues by engaging with locals, patrolman, smugglers, and many other people living in and being affected by the U.S.-México border. He also chooses to address political issues by focusing on the large issue of drug trafficking.  Related artworks  Border Tuner is a project by the Mexican-Canadian Artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer that explores connections which exist between cities and people on either side of the Mexico - United States border. Situated in the El Paso / Juarez borderlands, this interactive work utilizes large searchlights as a means for participants on either side of the border to communicate with one another. When one beam of light interacts with another, a microphone and speaker automatically switch on allowing participants on both sides to communicate across the hardened infrastructure which divides their two countries. The searchlight, most commonly used in applications of surveillance and apprehension of migrants by the United States Border Patrol is one of the symbols which Lozano-Hemmer subverts in his work. Of this loaded symbol he says: “I find searchlights absolutely abhorrent, that’s why I must work with them.” Borrando La Frontera (Erasing the Border) by Ana Teresa Fernandez challenges the materiality of the U.S./Mexico border through its erasure of the structure. In the film, Ana Teresa Fernandez hopes to “[turn] a wall that divides into the ocean and the sky that expands” into a symbol for potential future mobility.https://anateresafernandez.com/1718-2/ By making the border the same color as the sky, rendering it invisible, the artist draws attention to the naturalized sense of nation in opposition to the natural landscape. The artist creates new meaning for the sky's natural blue color, as she uses it to symbolize a geography with open borders and freedom of movement. By painting this idea over the border fence, Fernandez and her collaborators The film also emphasizes the natural elements of the scene The birds' and the water's movement, unfazed by the fence, attest to the redundancy of the fence and the politics of the U.S./Mexico border. Artesania & Cuidado (Craft & Care) by Tanya Aguiñiga serves as a collection of the artists work in activism, design, and documentation. Specifically, Aguiñiga's entry way to the gallery sets the tone for the exhibition. Aguiñiga is also responsible for AMBOS—Art Made Between Opposite Sides. The project consisting of artworks made that foster a sense of interconnectedness in border regions. The project is multifaceted and presents itself in the form of documentary, activism, community engagement, and collaboration to activate the U.S./ Mexico border, exploring identities affected by the luminal zone of the border and to promote healthy relationships from one side of the border to the other. \\"World Trade Center Walk\\" by (Philippe Petit) Called the \\"artistic crime of the century,\\" Petit's daring feat became the focus of a media sensation. On the morning of August 7, Petit stepped onto the tightrope, which was suspended between the two towers. A crowd of thousands soon gathered to watch the man on the wire more than 1,300 feet above them. For 45 minutes, Petit practically danced on the thin metal line. He was arrested for his efforts and was ordered to give a performance in Central Park as his sentence. Another artist tackling the contentions of the United States/Mexico border is Judi Werthein, who in 2005 created a line of shoes titled, Brinco, Spanish for the word Jump. These shoes would be distributed, free of charge, to people in Tijuana looking to cross the border. Werthein explains, \\"The shoe includes a compass, a flashlight because people cross at night, and inside is included also some Tylenol painkillers because many people get injured during crossing.\\" Additionally, the shoes featured removable soles with a map of the San Diego/Tijuana border, specifically indicating favorable routes to take. On the back of the ankle of the shoe is an image of Toribio Romo González, the saint dedicated to Mexican migrants. The shoes themselves were made cheaply and mass-produced from China, imitating the means of production abused by many American companies. These shoes would also be sold in small boutique shops in San Diego for $215 a pair, advertised to the higher class audience as \\"one-of-a-kind art objects.\\" The profits of this venture would then be donated to a Tijuana shelter aiding migrants in need. Jorge Rojas’s performance art is complex in its approach of reflecting his cross-cultural experiences in both Mexico and America. Rojas was born in Morelos, Mexico, and now lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. This change in residence has informed the changes in his work regarding his feelings of home vs. homeland. His work examines this change in homeland in ways that highlight his foreignness and his awareness of both cultures. His performance pieces often combine Mexican cultural themes with a performance style that creates a new space to identify the constant change in cultural identity. Shinji Ohmaki's piece “Liminal Air Space-Time” talks about the physical sense of liminal space, and how this represents a boarder. this liminal space is represented by a thin white piece oh clothe that blows in the air. The use of vents underneath constantly keeps it floating in the air. Ohmaki says, \\"The cloth moves up and down, causing a fluctuation of the borders that divide various territories… some people they will feel that time is passing quickly While others might feel that time is being slowed down. By tilting the sensations, a dimension of time and space that differs from everyday life can be created.\\" So just like and actual boarder you get a sense of not knowing whee you are and how long you will be stuck float in the air.http://www.shinjiohmaki.net/portfolio/liminal-air/liminal_air_space- time_en.html  History of border art specific to Palestine-Israel  Israel Border Police Monument In June 2005, performance artist Francis Alÿs walked from one end of Jerusalem to the other performing The Green Line. In this performance, Alÿs is carrying a can filled with green paint. The bottom of the can was perforated with a small hole, so the paint dripped out as a continuous squiggly line on the ground as he walked. The route he followed was one drawn in green on a map as part of the armistice after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, indicating land under the control of the new state of Israel. Alÿs restricted his walking to a 15-mile stretch through a divided Jerusalem, a hike that took him down streets, through yards and parks, and over rocky abandoned terrain. Julien Deveaux documented the walk alongside Alÿs.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/arts/design/13chan.htmlhttp://francisalys.com/the- green-line/https://www.julien-devaux.com/ Architecture - King Hussein Bridge Artist invested in Palestine/Israel art: Sama Alshaibi: A well known artist that uses her body as an instrument for her artwork. Focuses the context of double generational displacement as well as the notion of being \\"illegal\\" in the United States as described as psychological displacement. Her body serves as an \\"allegorical sight\\" and \\"captures feminine perspective.\\" She focuses on portraying the life of a displaced Palestinian woman who immigrated to the United States at an early age with her family. She also describes information based on embroidery with Palestinian and Arab women. Some of her artworks are: Milk Maid, Carry Over, Together Apart, and Between Two Rivers.  International artists and their influence  There have been several artists from other countries who have come to the Israeli West Bank barrier and used the wall itself as a canvas to express their condemnation of its establishment. They have worked in hand with local Palestinian street artists as well to express their sentiments and ultimately get across their message. These much more well known international artists have also aided in turning the public eye to the conflict that is occurring between Palestine and Israel. Many of the artists that work on the separation barrier have taken something that is perceived as an instrument of division and thus turned it into the canvas in which they create their message.  Banksy  Banksy, Dove, 2008, Bethlehem, Palestine. |alt= The anonymous, UK-based artist, Banksy, is a prominent figure in the way individuals have used the separation wall as surface to express their dissent for its establishment. He has used the dimension of the wall, the division it represents, and the context behind it to make works that succeed in their environment. One of his more popular works depicts a dove, a symbol of peace, juxtaposed with it wearing a bullet-proof vest. Here, it can be inferred that Banksy is trying to express that there is a want for peace between the two nations, yet given the history of violence, they must be prepared for conflict. Essentially, he is demonstrating the fake sense of peace that is being generated as a byproduct of this wall. Banksy, Children with Paradise Landscape, 2005, Bethlehem, Palestine. |alt= Other works Banksy has done over the years also including creating optical illusions to break up the solidarity of the wall. He tries to emphasize the elements of a barrier, how it divides up space and creates a disconnect from the world around the viewer. He has works such as children in front of a \\"hole\\" in front of the wall that reveals a paradise, a world unseen by the viewer due to the obstruction by the wall. Banksy has expressed his different opinions on the Israeli-Palestine conflict and the experiences he has encountered while working on border art. An often cited conversation between Banksy and a Palestinian man helps illustrate the sentiments towards the wall from the Palestinian perspective: \\"Old man: You paint the wall, you make it look beautiful. Me [Banksy]: Thanks. Old man: We don't want it to be beautiful, we hate this wall. Go home.\\" The gravity of this conversation demonstrates how border art can have a political message or help a group of people express their opinion, yet it the art cannot take away the wall. In this interaction, the wall is the antagonist to the Palestinian people and any attempt to beautify the wall is rendered useless because it does not remove the rift that is produced. Banksy has made other comments regarding the size and scale of the separation barrier in regards to how it essentially isolates the Palestinian population, nearly surrounding them on every side. He says, \\"It essentially turns Palestine into the world's largest open-air prison.\\"  Swoon (artist)  Swoon, Lace-Weaving Woman, 2009, Bethlehem, Palestine Another artist is American born street artist, swoon, who has worked on the separation barrier as one of the few prominent female artists that have influenced the male dominated world of street art. Swoon is instrumental to creating a female narrative in this increasingly studied area of art. Many of her pieces depict women as the key figures and protagonists of their respective compositions and ultimately gives another perspective to the border art phenomenon. Her border art on the separation barrier focuses on the characteristics of scale and location, causing the viewer to comprehend the sheer size of the wall in relation to the body. Swoon explains why scale is important to her by saying, \\" '...I think it's important that people understand the scale of it because it helps in understanding the grotesque power imbalance that the Palestinian people are facing.' \\" By creating this contrast in size of the viewer to her art work, it causes the individual to question the wall, bring attention to it, and consider the lengths Israel has taken to protect itself from external forces. One of her works that demonstrates this concept is that of her Lace-Weaving Woman, here the subject rises about halfway up the wall and looks as if she weaving her skirt. The action of weaving here implies a sense of unity, and in its context is juxtaposed as the wall is symbolized as division. Other pieces by Swoon have been focusing on location such as creating art where a Palestinian youth had placed a Palestinian flag at the top of the barrier and then was subsequently arrested by Israeli officials. Swoon has not given definitive meanings behind her work, and allow the viewers to interpret these spaces where she has worked and how her art has changed it, if at all.  Conceptual border(s)  Borders can also be conceptual. For example, borders between social classes or races. Gloria Anzaldúa's conceptualization of borders goes beyond national borders. Anzaldúa states: \\"The U.S.-Mexican border es una herida abierta where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds. And before a scab form, it hemorrhages again, the lifeblood of two worlds merging to form a third country - a border culture.\\" Anzaldúa also refers to the border as being a locus of rupture and resistance; fragmented.Borderlands. Border artists include Ana Mendieta, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Coco Fusco, and Mona Hatoum. Conceptually speaking, borders, as discussed by Claire Fox, can be found anywhere; it is portable. Especially wherever poor, ethnic, immigrant, and/or minority communities collide with hegemonic society. Prieto notes that “This double task --being critical while at the same time proposing a utopian borderless future-- was undertaken with the tools of conceptual art.” Conceptual art was a European avant-garde artistic practice which focused on the intellectual development of an artwork rather than art as object. thumb Border is further discussed in Adalbarto Aguirre Jr. and Jennifer K. Simmers academic journal and discusses the fluidity of borders saying that“The border merges land and people into a shared body of social and cultural representation.” The article also continues on saying that the meaning of border changes with the people that experience them. Sheren additionally echoes that “‘Border’ began to refer to a variety of non-physical boundaries: those between cultural or belief systems, those separating the colonial and the postcolonial, and even those demarcating various kinds of subjects.” In this way, borders transcend physicality and become ‘portable’. In a conceptual mindset, the human body can be viewed as a borderline. This is explored in Gloria Anzaldua's article La Frontera = The Border: Art about the Mexico/United States Border Experience. She discusses at length the Layers of our identities and how we become these boundaries within our environment. She mentions the dynamics that affect our identities such as sex, gender, education, ethnicity, race, class, etc. The author questions if these are equal parts or are pieces of our self more prevalent due to our surroundings? She speaks about the concept of unified consciousness, a mix of identity from the universal collective in human existence. She continues by saying we must articulate a person not categorized by one thing but as a history of identities such as student, mother, sister, brother, teacher, craftsman, coworker, etc. Another individual who also explores ideas of the human body acting as a conceptual border is Sama Alshaibi. This is expressed in her personal essay and art titled Memory Work in the Palestinian Diaspora. In contextualizing her art work that is mentioned later in the piece, she discusses her and her family's personal history. \\"My body, pictured in my American passport, had the ability to travel and move freely in this world and could come back to the U.S. and speak for those whom I met in Occupied Palestine, confined to a single city and cut off from the world by massive walls.\\" After referencing her own personal and familial narratives, Sama then shifts her discussion toward utilizing her body again within her art; her body acts as \\"a vehicle to embody and illustrate visual narratives of the Palestinian past and present.\\" Overall, her photographs and videos depicting her body at the center of focus are all in an attempt to construct a \\"collective memory,\\" \\"...[a memory] which culminates in a different mediation of history, one that resists the \\"official\\" and mediated history Palestine and Israel. Stuart Hall also elaborates on the concept of identity in his article: Ethnicity, Identity, and Difference. He replaces the idea of an intersectional identity model with a layered identity model. The layered model lists titles of identity within one person in order of which is more prevalent depending on the circumstances. The intersectional is outdated due to the idea of having one central identity and branching off of it is a multitude of descriptions such as race, class, and gender. Trinh T. Minh-ha additionally observes “boundaries not only express the desire to free/to subject one practice, one culture, one national community from/to another, but also expose the extent to which cultures are products of the continuing struggle between official and unofficial narratives–those largely circulated in favor of the State and its policies of inclusion, incorporation, and validation, as well as of exclusion, appropriation, and dispossession.” Patssi Valdez touches on the idea of the border in her screenprint, \\"L.A./TJ.\\" Valdez is an American Chicana artist currently living and working in Los Angeles. Unlike most who hear the word border and immediately assume separation, her idea of a border is a frame. Seen in L.A./TJ, Valdez frames the two cities, thus exaggerating the idea of mixing reality rather than separating the two. This mixing of reality is a symbol of her belonging and interacting with both Mexico and the United States. Expanding notions of “Border Art” There exist inherent difficulties in articulating the traumas of the Holocaust. The art created between direct and post-generational participants redefines notions of “memory-as-border.” In other words, understanding the notions of “border” becomes complex in relation to firsthand and secondhand trauma. One example of this thought is how the experiences of those directly involved in the Holocaust effect their offspring? Marianne Hirsch describes this phenomenon as “postmemory.” Postmemory most specifically describes the relationship of children of survivors of cultural or collective trauma to the experiences of their parents, experiences that they “remember” only as the narratives and images with which they grew up, but that are so powerful, so monumental, as to constitute memories in their own right. The term “postmemory” is meant to convey its temporal and qualitative difference from survivor memory, its secondary, or second-generation memory quality, its basis in displacement, its vicariousness and belatedness. The work of postmemory defines the familial inheritance and transmission of cultural trauma. The children of victims, survivors, witnesses, or perpetrators have different experiences of postmemory, even though they share the familial ties that facilitate intergenerational identification. Artist Sama Alshaibi, considers Hirsch's conception of postmemory as \\"key to my life and to my art practice, which is, after all, an extension of who I am.\\" Born to a Palestinian mother and an Iraqi father, Alshaibi describes her upbringing as \\"...dominated by traumatic narratives of losing Palestine, and all along I was mourning for a place unknown to me.\\" As a result, her work is \\"based on narratives of my mother's family's forced migration from Palestine to Iraq and then on to America.\\" In Headdress of the Disinherited, Alshaibi photographic work features the artist wearing her recreation of a traditional Palestinian headdress lined with coins that were used as a bride's wedding dowry. Alshaibi describes the headdress as part of an inter-generational transmission: \\"Fashioned after my mother's faint memory of her grandmother's, our collaborative effort constructs a memorial to our family's continual migrations.\\" Alshaibi recreated the headdress using familial ephemera and travel documentation rather than coins, \\"Substituting the no longer minted Palestinian currency with coins embossed with our visas, passport stamps, and pictures suggests an intellectual dowry rather than a monetary one.\\" Dowry money hat resembles migration and displacement. The placement continues to hold an effect over heads today, with the dematerialization of women's bodies and cultures from the region.

He played for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 2016 and 2017 and didn’t play at all in 2018 or 2019. Rivera is a native of New York City, and went undrafted after playing college baseball at Troy University. He made his MLB debut in 2016, and played for the Puerto Rican national baseball team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Personal life Rivera was born to Tommy, a handyman, and Nilsa Rivera, an insurance adjuster. Rivera is of Puerto Rican descent. His mother and father are from Aibonito and Ponce, Puerto Rico. He represented Puerto Rico at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Rivera grew up as a fan of the New York Yankees, but also liked the Mets. Rivera met his wife, Ashton, at Troy University. Amateur career Rivera grew up in the Throgs Neck neighborhood of the Bronx. He played in local little leagues in Throgs Neck and Parkchester, and often played sports including baseball on concrete fields or in the street. In 2001 at the age of 12, Rivera played in a Little League district championship, eliminated by Danny Almonte and the \\"Baby Bombers\\" who went on to the Little League World Series. (The Baby Bombers had their wins wiped out retroactively due to the Almonte fraud.https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/2001-league-world-series- darling-danny-almonte-fresh-start-article-1.458127) Rivera attended Herbert H. Lehman High School in eastern Bronx. After attending tryouts using a softball glove and playing junior varsity his freshman year, he went on to play varsity for three seasons while batting over .600 his junior and senior years. Rivera began his college baseball career at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey where he then transferred to Wallace Community College in the Alabama Community College Conference, in Dothan, Alabama. Rivera chose Wallace in order to play against tougher competition in warmer weather. After two seasons, Rivera transferred to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he played for the Troy Trojans. He graduated from Troy in 2011 majoring in criminal justice, but went unselected in the Major League Baseball draft. Professional career Minor league career Former Mets catcher Mackey Sasser, Rivera's head coach at Wallace Community, recommended him to a scout for the New York Mets, who then signed him as a free agent. Rivera had a .301 batting average in 2011, splitting the season between the Kingsport Mets of the Rookie-level Appalachian League and the Brooklyn Cyclones of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. In 2014, Rivera hit .349 with five home runs and 75 runs batted in (RBIs) for the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League and the Binghamton Mets of the Class AA Eastern League. He returned to Binghamton to start the 2015 season, and was promoted to the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) on May 16. Despite hitting .306 with 17 doubles in 54 games, the Mets demoted Rivera to Binghamton on August 1. The Mets chose not to add Rivera to their 40-man roster after the 2015 season, exposing him to the Rule 5 draft; he went unselected. The Mets invited Rivera to spring training in 2016. He began the 2016 season with Las Vegas. He was named the PCL's Player of the Month for May, when he batted .373 with five home runs. He ended the season as the PCL batting champion. Major league career After batting .349 with 11 home runs and 90 RBIs for Las Vegas, and being named the PCL's Player of the Week for August 1 through 7, the Mets promoted him to the Major Leagues on August 10. He made his debut that night, starting at third base, and collected his first Major League hit in his debut. He had a 2-run double against the San Diego Padres for the first two runs batted in of his Major League career. He hit his first major league home run on September 13, a go-ahead solo shot in the tenth inning off of Mark Melancon of the Washington Nationals. Rivera batted .333 in 33 games for the Mets. He became the Mets' everyday second baseman toward the end of the season, after injuries suffered by Neil Walker and Wilmer Flores, and started the National League Wild Card game. In 2017, Rivera was named to his first ever Major League Opening Day roster. He was sent down to AAA on June 11 to make room for Yoenis Céspedes, but recalled on June 13 after Asdrúbal Cabrera went on the disabled list. The Mets placed Rivera on the 10-day disabled list on July 28, after a partial tear in his right ulnar collateral ligament. He underwent Tommy John surgery towards the end of the 2017 campaign. He hoped to return to the Mets around midseason, but an elbow sprain suffered while playing rehabilitation games in the minor leagues ended his season. He recorded 22 plate appearances in the minor leagues during the 2018 season. Rivera continued to struggle with his rehabilitation during spring training in 2019. On March 9, the Mets released Rivera. Rivera was signed by the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League on July 6, 2019. On August 4, 2019, Rivera's contract was purchased by the Washington Nationals. He became a free agent following the 2019 season. On December 15, 2019, Rivera signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. Rivera was released by the Phillies organization on May 28, 2020. International career Rivera played for the Puerto Rican national baseball team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic as their first baseman. Scouting report Rivera is known as a contact hitter with a compact line drive swing. Rivera has hit for high average throughout his career, batting over .300 at the minor league level. He however does not hit for power or draw frequent walks, qualities which are highly valued in the sabermetric era. Rivera credited playing wiffle ball as a youth with creating his swing. Rivera has played second, third, and first base at the Major League level, and has previously played shortstop in college and the minors. He considers second base his natural position.

In Arabic, the group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has called itself ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah () since June 2014. Before it was known under the name ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī 'l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām (), which it adopted in April 2013. The literal translation of their previous name resulted in confusion, resulting in both ISIS and ISIL, two acronyms based on different literal translations of the name into English. Apart from these, an Arabic-derived acronym, Daesh or Da'ish gained traction well beyond Arabic-speaking parts of the world. Finally, the group's current name caused controversy due to its English translation as Islamic State (IS) and as a result, both the previous acronyms are still widely used, or a qualifier is often added to the IS name, such as \\"self-styled Islamic State\\". Background Originating in Iraq, the group underwent various previous name changes, and since 2006 had been known as Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), a name which had failed to gain any traction, as the group had failed to gain or hold any significant territory as ISI, and thus widespread confusion over what to call them was largely absent. Confusion began when the group gained further territory and changed its name to ad- Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī 'l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām in April 2013 as it expanded into Syria. It then changed to ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah in June 2014 as part of a desire to re-establish a caliphate. The rendering of the Arabic name in English varies, due to imprecise translation. In Arabic it is called Daesh which means D dawlat=state in English, A or I = Iraq, e= and , SH= al-Sham, a term for a region encompassing Syria and Lebanon. Translation of the name's components Literal translation of ash-Shām The parallel use of both ISIS and ISIL as acronym originated from uncertainty in how to translate the Arabic word \\"ash-Shām\\" (or \\"al-Sham\\") in the group's April 2013 name, which can be translated variously as \\"the Levant\\", \\"Greater Syria\\", \\"Syria\\" or even \\"Damascus\\". This led to the widely used translations of \\"Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant\\", \\"Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\\" or \\"Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham\\". \\"The Levant\\" generally refers to at least part or all of Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon, though its definition varies. According to the BBC, since neither \\"Levant\\", nor \\"Syria\\", reflect the group's likely meaning of the word al-Sham in Arabic, \\"various experts have therefore said that the word al-Sham should not be translated\\" (when rendering the long form name). According to Syrian-American journalist Hassan Hassan, if the term Levant had been the intended meaning, the Arabic word would have been \\"Bilad al-Sham\\", whereas the more likely meaning of Greater Syria still leads to the acronym ISIS. Literal translation of ad-Dawlah In contrast to the difficulties in translation of the group's former name, according to The Guardian the group's 2014 name \\"near enough\\" literally translates to \\"Islamic State\\", however there is still a remaining difficulty since this fails to capture the true Arabic connotations, which are closer to a religious concept of a united Islamic community (ummah) under Sharia law, as opposed to western concept of a bureaucratic state apparatus. Other names Reflecting the desire to build a caliphate, the group also refers to itself as \\"al-Dawla\\", meaning simply \\"the State\\". Syrians living under the group's control referred to them as \\"al-tanzeem,\\" Arabic for \\"the organization.\\" Reflecting the group's origins as a renegade splinter group, supporters of Al-Qaeda referred to the group simply as \\"al-Baghdadi's group\\". Daesh and variants The name \\"Daesh\\" is often used by ISIL's Arabic-speaking detractors. It is based on the Arabic letters Dāl, 'alif, ʻayn, and shīn, which together form the acronym of ISIL's 2013 name '. It is pronounced with the emphasis on a long \\"e\\", which lends itself to being said in a snarling or aggressive tone in Arabic speech. The acronym was reportedly first used by supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Daesh is used by many Muslims, who believe it better separates the group from their faith. While \\"Daesh\\" has no other meaning in Arabic, it is very similar to the Arabic word (Daes), meaning \\"one who crushes (or tramples down) something underfoot\\". It also resembles the Arabic word (Dāhis), the beginning of (Dāhis wa'l-Ghabrā', or \\"Felon and dust\\"), which refers to the Islamic concept of the Jahiliyyah and can be loosely translated as \\"one who sows discord\\". Both words obviously have a negative connotation in Arabic culture, undermining the group's claim to have revived the Caliphate, leading to the group objecting to it as a pejorative name. Another reason for objection is the rarity of acronyms in Arabic, particularly those which have no meaning. \\"The United Nations\\" for example is always translated directly in Arabic, with no \\"UN\\" acronym equivalent. \\"Fatah\\" and \\"Hamas\\" are acronyms but they are also Arabic words in their own right (meaning \\"Conquest\\" and \\"Zeal\\" respectively). \\"Daesh\\" however is not only an acronym but also phonetically meaningless in Arabic, reducing the legitimacy of the name and by extension the group to which it belongs. However, according to the British ambassador to Iraq speaking in January 2015, Daesh has since become an Arabic word in its own right, with a plural – daw'aish () – meaning \\"bigots who impose their views on others\\". By the end of the year, the plural term was in widespread use in the middle East. According to Associate Press reporting the words of residents of Mosul in Iraq who were speaking on condition of anonymity, the group itself wishes to be referred by its full name only, Islamic State, considering the acronym Daesh to be disrespectful, going so far as to threaten to cut the tongue out of anyone who used it in public. According to The Week, experts argue that it is a key aim of the group to secure sole use of names which imply statehood and an Islamic faith, for purposes of propaganda. According to the American commander of the US mission in Iraq and Syria, Lt Gen James Terry, the Arab coalition partners believed strongly that the US should avoid referring to the enemy as ISIL and instead use Daesh, to avoid giving legitimacy to the group's aims. Although these names were being widely used in the Arabic world, the western media were initially slow to adopt them, in favour of ISIS/ISIL. This has subsequently changed after the group's name change to IS, with media and politicians now using it widely, with the BBC speculating this was either \\"despite or perhaps as a direct consequence of the irritation it causes the group\\". Karin Ryding, emerita professor of Arab linguistics at Georgetown University, suggested Daesh is sub-optimal, since many English speakers are unable to pronounce it the same way Arabic speakers do, due to the voiced pharyngeal fricative, represented by the apostrophe in Dai'ish. Common usage Usage of ISIS, ISIL vs. Islamic State Most English language outlets initially first used ISIS, while usage of ISIL later increased. Use of ISIS was particularly more prevalent than ISIL in British media. It has been argued that ISIS has been retained simply because it rolls off the tongue of English speakers, who are familiar with it through its other meaning as the name of an Egyptian goddess. The group's adoption of the name Islamic State led to controversy due to the inference that it represented the Islamic faith or was a sovereign state, leading to outlets choosing to retain the acronyms ISIS or ISIL, or using qualifiers on the new name. Despite the objections, use of the group's preferred name of Islamic State without qualification also spread. Government and organisations The United Nations generally refers to the group as ISIL. Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has also used \\"Un-Islamic Non-State\\". Governments of the Arab states adopted Daesh initially, and have continued to use it rather than IS. The Israeli government approach has been the same as Arab states. The British government originally used ISIL, but adopted Daesh on 2 December 2015. The French government adopted 'Daech' (French transliteration of Daesh) over its previous French name, EIIL (L'Etat islamique en Irak et au Levant), stating other names \\"blur the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists\\". The Australian government under Prime Minister Tony Abbott adopted Daesh in January 2015. The United States government designated Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as the group's primary name, believing \\"Levant\\" to be the more accurate translation. It also listed the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), ad-Dawla al- Islamiyya fi al-'Iraq wa-sh-Sham, Daesh, Dawla al Islamiya, and Al-Furqan Establishment for Media Production, as aliases. This was to disassociate the group from the al-Nusrah Front (ANF), as a result of the rift between the two groups. Usage has not been consistent however, with ISIS, ISIL, Islamic State and Daesh all being used variously, both domestically and overseas, with the precise term chosen based on the audience, recognising the need for consistency and that the American public was more familiar with ISIL, while also catering to partners who are more attached to Daesh. President Barack Obama used ISIL. In February 2017, the Pentagon adopted the abbreviation ISIS when referencing the group. A spokesman for the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs told Power & Politics in December 2014, \\"Whether it is called Daesh, ISIL or ISIS, Canada and the coalition agree this heinous terrorist group presents a threat to the region, and the entire world. That is why Canada has announced a number of measures designed to combat ISIL's brutality and help victims of this barbaric terrorist group.\\" Media style guides The Associated Press originally opted to use ISIL, believing Levant to be the most accurate translation. After the name change to IS, it has switched to referring to the \\"Islamic State group\\". The AP's guide is used by many media organisations. BBC News chose to refer to it as \\"Islamic State group\\", \\"so- called islamic State\\", or \\"self-styled Islamic State\\" in the first instance, shortening it to IS on subsequent mentions. In face of criticism from politicians, it stood by the decision, arguing Daesh was pejorative and that its approach was necessary to maintain impartiality. NPR uses \\"Islamic State\\" with the optional use of qualifiers in the first instance, then ISIS thereafter. RT uses \\"Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL)\\" when reporting on the Islamic State. USA Today \\"identifies the group as the Islamic State, the Islamic State militant group, or the Islamic State extremist group.\\" The New York Times uses \\"Islamic State\\", choosing to explain it in context. The Guardian, and its sister paper The Observer, uses \\"Islamic State\\" at first mention and \\"ISIS\\" thereafter. (It does not uppercase acronyms). It chose \\"ISIS\\" over \\"ISIL\\" as being more usual in British media. In September 2014 it was considering switching to \\"IS\\", but by April 2016 had not done so, but instead used ISIS. Following the name change, it moved to \\"Islamic State (ISIS)\\" at first mention, and thereafter IS. Iran's news outlets such as state-owned Press TV use the name \\"Daesh Takfiri\\" (see Iran and ISIL). Financial Times chose to stick with ISIS even after the group's name change. Several newspapers published by Metro International such as the Toronto edition sourced from the Toronto Star uses \\"Daesh\\". Many newspapers, such as The Age use the expression \\"so-called Islamic State\\". Reaction Some media commentators have suggested that the debate over what to call the group was of little importance when compared to the need to actually stop them. Rod Liddle has argued that avoiding the group's proper name goes against journalistic tradition, and indeed avoiding their use of the term \\"Islamic\\" is counter- productive considering many believe the right strategy to defeat them is to call on the help of Muslim communities. William McCants argues attempts to avoid Islamic State denies the basic reality that they have managed to establish a state. Writing for The Washington Post, Amanda Bennett cast the debate as less about the meaning of words, but what they convey, contrasting politician's wish to have the group seen in a negative light, with the tradition in journalistic and academic circles to use organisations own preferred names, with explanation if there is a confusion or conflict with other meanings. Writing in The Independent, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, Miqdaad Versi, argued that daesh is preferable to allowing the group to be able to use its preferred name, pointing out there were various inconsistencies in the BBC's and other outlets choice not to translate the names of other groups, and pointing out that Boko Haram is also an unofficial pejorative name. On the issue of journalistic tradition of using recognisable names, Stephen Pritchard of The Guardian relayed the failure of their paper to get it right when they initially used \\"The Brotherhood\\", the rough English translation to refer to the little known Al-Qaeda group in the wake of the September 11 attacks, before quickly dropping it as the Arabic name gained traction, despite it being their chosen brand.

At the time, it was occupied by George Sodder, his wife Jennie, and nine of their ten children. During the fire, George, Jennie, and four of the nine children escaped. The bodies of the other five children have never been found. The Sodders believed for the rest of their lives that the five missing children survived. The Sodders never rebuilt the house, instead converting the site into a memorial garden to their lost children. In the 1950s, as they came to doubt that the children had perished, the family put up a billboard at the site along State Route 16 with pictures of the five, offering a reward for information that would bring closure to the case. It remained up until shortly after Jennie Sodder's death in 1989. In support of their belief that the children survived, the Sodders have pointed to a number of unusual circumstances before and during the fire. George disputed the fire department's finding that the blaze was electrical in origin, noting that he had recently had the house rewired and inspected. He and his wife suspected arson, leading to theories that the children had been taken by the Sicilian Mafia, perhaps in retaliation for George's outspoken criticism of Benito Mussolini and the fascist government of his native Italy. State and federal efforts to investigate the case further in the early 1950s yielded no new information. The family did, however, later receive what may have been a picture of one of the boys as an adult during the 1960s. Their one surviving daughter, along with their grandchildren, have continued to publicize the case in the 21st century in the media and online. Background George Sodder was born with the name Giorgio Soddu in Tula, Sardinia, Italy in 1895. He immigrated to the United States thirteen years later with an older brother, who went back home as soon as both he and George had cleared customs at Ellis Island. For the rest of his life George, as he came to be known, would not talk much about why he had left his homeland. Sodder eventually found work on the railroads in Pennsylvania, carrying water and other supplies to workers. After a few years he took more permanent work as a driver in Smithers, West Virginia. After a few more years, he started his own trucking company, at first hauling fill dirt to construction sites and later hauling coal that was mined in the region. Jennie Cipriani, a storekeeper's daughter in Smithers who had also immigrated from Italy in her childhood, became George's wife. The couple settled outside nearby Fayetteville, which had a large population of Italian immigrants, in a two-story timber frame house north of town. In 1923, they had the first of their ten children. George's business prospered, and they became \\"one of the most respected middle-class families around\\" in the words of one local official. However, George had strong opinions about many subjects and was not shy about expressing them, sometimes alienating people. In particular, his strident opposition to Italian dictator Benito Mussolini had led to some strong arguments with other members of the immigrant community. The last of the Sodder children, Sylvia, was born in 1943. By then, their second oldest son, Joe, had left home to serve in the military during World War II. The following year, Mussolini was deposed and executed. However, George's criticism of the late dictator had left some hard feelings. In October 1945, a visiting life insurance salesman, after being rebuffed, warned George that his house \\"[would go] up in smoke ... and your children are going to be destroyed\\", attributing this all to \\"the dirty remarks you have been making about Mussolini.\\" Another visitor to the house, ostensibly seeking work, took the occasion to go around to the back and warned George that a pair of fuse boxes would \\"cause a fire someday.\\" George was puzzled by the observation, since he had just had the house rewired when an electric stove was installed, and the local electric company had said afterwards it was safe. In the weeks before Christmas that year, George's older sons had also noticed a strange car parked along the main highway through town, its occupants watching the younger Sodder children as they returned from school. Christmas Eve 1945 house fire The Sodders celebrated on Christmas Eve 1945. Marion, the oldest daughter, had been working at a dime store in downtown Fayetteville, and she surprised three of her younger sisters—Martha (12), Jennie (8), and Betty (5)—with new toys she had bought for them there as gifts. The younger children were so excited that they asked their mother if they could stay up past what would have been their usual bedtime. At 10:00 p.m., Jennie told them they could stay up a little later, as long as the two oldest boys who were still awake, 14-year-old Maurice and his 9-year-old brother Louis, remembered to put the cows in and feed the chickens before going to bed themselves. George and the two oldest boys, John (23) and George Jr. (16), who had spent the day working with their father, were already asleep. After reminding the children of those remaining chores, she took Sylvia (2) upstairs with her and went to bed together. The telephone rang at 12:30 a.m. Jennie woke and went downstairs to answer it. The caller was a woman whose voice she did not recognize, asking for a name she was not familiar with, with the sound of laughter and clinking glasses in the background. Jennie told the caller she had reached a wrong number, later recalling the woman's \\"weird laugh\\". Jennie hung up and returned to bed. As she did, she noticed that the lights were still on and the curtains were not drawn, two things the children normally attended to when they stayed up later than their parents. Marion had fallen asleep on the living room couch, so Jennie assumed the other children who had stayed up later had gone back up to the attic where they slept. She closed the curtains, turned out the lights, and returned to bed. At 1:00 a.m., Jennie was again awakened by a sound of an object hitting the house's roof with a loud bang, then a rolling noise. After hearing nothing further, she went back to sleep. After another half hour she woke up again, smelling smoke. When she got up again she found that the room George used for his office was on fire, around the telephone line and fuse box. Jennie woke him and he in turn woke his older sons. Both parents and four of their children—Marion, Sylvia, John and George Jr—escaped the house. They frantically yelled to the children upstairs but heard no response; they could not go up there as the stairway itself was already aflame. John said in his first police interview after the fire that he went up to the attic to alert his siblings sleeping there, though he later changed his story to say that he only called up there and did not actually see them. Efforts to find, aid, and rescue the children were unexpectedly complicated. The phone did not work, so Marion ran to a neighbor's to call the fire department. A driver on the nearby road had also seen the flames and called from a nearby tavern; they too were unsuccessful either because they could not reach the operator or because the phone there turned out to be broken. Either the neighbor or the passing motorist was eventually successful in reaching the fire department from another phone in the center of town. George, barefoot, climbed the wall and broke open an attic window, cutting his arm in the process. He and his sons intended to use a ladder to the attic to rescue the other children, but it was not in its usual spot resting against the house and could not be found anywhere nearby. A water barrel that could have been used to extinguish the fire was frozen solid. George then tried to pull both of the trucks he used in his business up to the house and use them to climb to the attic window, but neither of them would start despite having worked perfectly during the previous day. Frustrated, the six Sodders who had escaped had no choice but to watch the house burn down and collapse over the next 45 minutes. They assumed the other five children had perished in the blaze. The fire department, low on manpower due to the war and relying on individual firefighters to call each other, did not respond until later that morning. Chief F.J. Morris said the next day that the already slow response was further hampered by his inability to drive the fire truck, requiring that he wait until someone who could drive was available. The firefighters, one of whom was a brother of Jennie's, could do little but look through the ashes that were left in the Sodders' basement. By 10:00 a.m., Morris told the Sodders that they had not found any bones, as might have been expected if the other children had been in the house as it burned. According to another account, they did find a few bone fragments and internal organs, but chose not to tell the family; it has also been noted by modern fire professionals that their search was cursory at best. Nevertheless, Morris believed that the five children unaccounted for had died in the fire, suggesting it had been hot enough to burn their bodies completely. Aftermath Morris told George to leave the site undisturbed so that the state fire marshal's office could conduct a more thorough investigation. However, after four days, George and his wife could not bear the sight anymore, so he bulldozed of dirt over the site with the intention of converting it to a memorial garden for the lost children. The local coroner convened an inquest the next day, which held that the fire was an accident caused by \\"faulty wiring\\". Among the jurors was the man who had threatened George that his house would be burned down and his children \\"destroyed\\" in retribution for his anti-Mussolini remarks. Death certificates for the five children were issued December 30. The local newspaper contradicted itself, stating that all the bodies had been found, but then later in the same story reporting that only part of one body was recovered. George and Jennie were too grief-stricken to attend the funeral on January 2, 1946, although their surviving children did. Family questions about the official account Not long afterward, as they began to rebuild their lives, the Sodders started to question all the official findings about the fire. They wondered why, if it had been caused by an electrical problem, the family's Christmas lights had remained on throughout the fire's early stages, when the power should have gone out. Then they found the ladder that had been missing from the side of the house on the night of the fire at the bottom of an embankment away. A telephone repairman told the Sodders that the house's phone line had not been burned through in the fire, as they had initially thought, but cut by someone who had been willing and able to climb up the pole and reach away from it to do so. A man whom neighbors had seen stealing a block and tackle from the property around the time of the fire was identified and arrested. He admitted to the theft, and claimed he had been the one who cut the phone line, thinking it was a power line, but denied having anything to do with the fire. However, no record identifying the suspect exists, and why he would have wanted to cut any utility lines to the Sodder house while stealing the block and tackle has never been explained. Jennie said in 1968 that if he had cut the power line, she and her husband, along with their other four children, would never have been able to make it out of the house. Jennie also had trouble accepting Morris's belief that all traces of the children's bodies had been burned completely in the fire. Many of the household appliances had been found, still recognizable, in the ash, along with fragments of the tin roof. She contrasted the results of the fire with a newspaper account of a similar house fire that she read around the same time that killed a family of seven; skeletal remains of all the victims were reported to have been found in that case. Jennie burned small piles of animal bones to see if they would be completely consumed; none ever were. An employee of a local crematorium she contacted told her that human bones remain even after bodies are burned at for two hours, far longer and hotter than the house fire could have been. The Sodders' trucks' failure to start was also considered. George believed they had been tampered with, perhaps by the same man who stole the block and tackle and cut the phone line. However, one of his sons-in-law told the Charleston Gazette- Mail in 2013 that he had come to believe that Sodder and his sons might have, in their haste to start the trucks, flooded the engines. Some accounts have suggested the wrong-number phone call to the Sodder house might have also somehow been connected to the fire and disappearance of the children. However, investigators later located the woman who had made the call. She confirmed it had been a wrong number on her part. Subsequent developments As spring approached, the Sodders, as they had said they would, planted flowers in the soil bulldozed over the house. Jennie tended it carefully for the rest of her life. However, further developments in early 1946 reinforced the family's belief that the children they were memorializing might, in fact, be alive somewhere. Evidence emerged which supported their belief that the fire had not started in the electrical fault and was instead set deliberately. The driver of a bus that passed through Fayetteville late Christmas Eve said he had seen some people throwing \\"balls of fire\\" at the house. A few months later, when the snow had melted, Sylvia found a small, hard, dark-green, rubber ball-like object in the brush nearby. George, recalling his wife's account of a loud thump on the roof before the fire, said it looked like a \\"pineapple bomb\\" hand grenade or some other incendiary device used in combat. The family later claimed that, contrary to the fire marshal's conclusion, the fire had started on the roof, although by then there was no way to prove it. Other witnesses claimed to have seen the children themselves. One woman who had been watching the fire from the road said she had seen some of them peering out of a passing car while the house was burning. Another woman at a rest stop between Fayetteville and Charleston said she had served them breakfast the next morning, and noted the presence of a car with Florida license plates in the rest stop's parking lot as well. The Sodders hired a private investigator named C.C. Tinsley from the nearby town of Gauley Bridge to look into the case. Tinsley learned that the insurance salesman who had threatened them with a fire a year before over George's anti-Mussolini sentiments had been on the coroner's jury that ruled the fire an accident, and told this to the Sodders. He also learned of rumors around Fayetteville that despite his report to the Sodders that no remains had been found in the ashes, Morris had found a heart, which he later packed into a metal box and secretly buried. Morris had apparently confessed this to a local minister, who confirmed it to George. George and Tinsley went to Morris and confronted him with this news. Morris agreed to show the two where he had buried the metal box, and they dug it up. They took what they found inside the box to a local funeral director, who after examining it told them it was in reality fresh beef liver that had never been exposed to fire. Later, more rumors circulated around Fayetteville—that Morris had afterwards admitted the box with the liver had indeed not come from the fire originally. He had supposedly placed it there in the hope that the Sodders would find it and be satisfied that the missing children had indeed died in the fire. 1949 excavation George did not wait for reports of sightings to come in. Sometimes he made them himself. After seeing a girl in a magazine picture of young ballet dancers in New York City who looked like one of his missing daughters, Betty, he drove all the way to the girl's school, where his repeated demands to see the girl himself were refused. He also tried to interest the FBI in investigating what he considered a kidnapping. Director J. Edgar Hoover personally responded to his letters. \\"Although I would like to be of service\\", he wrote, \\"the matter related appears to be of local character and does not come within the investigative jurisdiction of this bureau.\\" If the local authorities requested the bureau's assistance, he added, he would of course direct agents to assist, but the Fayetteville police and fire departments declined to do so. In August 1949, George was able to persuade Oscar Hunter, a Washington, D.C. pathologist, to supervise a new search through the dirt at the house site. After a very thorough search, artifacts including a dictionary that had belonged to the children and some coins were found. Several small bone fragments were unearthed, determined to have been human vertebrae. The bone fragments were sent to Marshall T. Newman, a specialist at the Smithsonian Institution. They were confirmed to be lumbar vertebrae, all from the same person. \\"Since the transverse recesses are fused, the age of this individual at death should have been 16 or 17 years\\", Newman's report said. \\"The top limit of age should be about 22 since the centra, which normally fuse at 23, are still unfused\\". Thus, given this age range, it was not very likely that these bones were from any of the five missing children, since the oldest, Maurice, had been 14 at the time (although the report allowed that vertebrae of a boy his age sometimes were advanced enough to appear to be at the lower end of the range). Newman added that the bone showed no sign of exposure to flame. Further, he agreed that it was \\"very strange\\" that those bones were the only ones found, since a wood fire of such short duration should have left full skeletons of all of the children behind. The report concluded that the vertebrae had, instead, most likely come from the dirt that George had bulldozed over the site. Later, Tinsley supposedly confirmed that the bone fragments had come from a cemetery in nearby Mount Hope, but could not explain why they had been taken from there or how they came to be at the fire site. The Smithsonian returned the bone fragments to George in September 1949, according to its records; their current location is unknown. The investigation and its findings attracted national attention, and the West Virginia Legislature held two hearings on the case in 1950. Afterwards, however, Governor Okey L. Patteson and state police superintendent W.E. Burchett told the Sodders the case was \\"hopeless\\" and closed it at the state level. The FBI decided it had jurisdiction as a possible interstate kidnapping, but dropped the case after two years of following fruitless leads. Continuing family investigation With the end of official efforts to resolve the case, the Sodders did not give up hope. They had flyers printed up with pictures of the children, offering a $5,000 reward (soon doubled) for information that would have settled the case for even one of them. In 1952, they put up a billboard at the site of the house (and another along U.S. Route 60 near Ansted) with the same information. It would in time become a landmark for traffic through Fayetteville on U.S. Route 19 (today State Route 16). The family's efforts soon brought another reported sighting of the children after the fire. Ida Crutchfield, a woman who ran a Charleston hotel, claimed to have seen the children approximately a week afterwards. \\"I do not remember the exact date\\", she said in a statement. The children had come in, around midnight, with two men and two women, all of whom appeared to her to be \\"of Italian extraction\\". When she attempted to speak with the children, \\"[o]ne of the men looked at me in a hostile manner; he turned around and began talking rapidly in Italian. Immediately, the whole party stopped talking to me\\". She recalled that they left the hotel early the next morning. Investigators today do not, however, consider her story credible as she had only first seen photos of the children two years after the fire, five years before she came forward. George followed up leads in person, traveling to the areas from where tips had come. A woman from St. Louis, Missouri claimed Martha was being held in a convent there. A bar patron in Texas claimed to have overheard two other people making incriminating statements about a fire that happened on Christmas Eve in West Virginia some years before. None of those proved significant. When George heard later that a relative of Jennie's in Florida had children that looked similar to his, the relative had to prove the children were his own before George was satisfied. In 1967, George went to the Houston area to investigate another tip. A woman there had written to the family, saying that Louis had revealed his true identity to her one night after having too much to drink. She believed that he and Maurice were both living in Texas somewhere. However, George and his son-in-law, Grover Paxton, were unable to speak with her. Police there were able to help them find the two men she had indicated, but they denied being the missing sons. Paxton said years later that doubts about that denial lingered in George's mind for the rest of his life. alt=A black and white photograph of a man with dark hair leaning towards the camera slightly, wearing a light-colored shirt with the collar open, against a dark background Another letter that they received that year brought the Sodders what they believed was the most credible evidence that at least Louis was still alive. One day Jennie found in the mail a letter addressed to her, postmarked in Central City, Kentucky, with no return address. Inside was a picture of a young man of around 30 with features strongly resembling Louis's, who would have been in his 30s if he had survived. On the back was written: ::Louis Sodder ::I love brother Frankie ::Ilil boys ::A90132 or 35 The family hired another private detective to go to Central City and look into the missive, but he never reported back to the Sodders and they were unable to locate him afterwards. The picture nonetheless gave them hope. They added it to the billboard (leaving Central City out of it and any other published information out of fear that Louis might come to harm) and put an enlargement of it over their fireplace. George admitted to the Charleston Gazette-Mail late the next year that the lack of information had been \\"like hitting a rock wall—we can't go any further\\". He nevertheless vowed to continue. \\"Time is running out for us\\", he admitted in another interview around that time. \\"But we only want to know. If they did die in the fire, we want to be convinced. Otherwise, we want to know what happened to them\\". George Sodder died in 1969. Jennie and her surviving children—except John, who never talked about the night of the fire except to say that the family should accept it and get on with their lives—continued to seek answers to their questions about the missing children's fate. After George's death, Jennie stayed in the family home, putting up fencing around it and adding additional rooms. For the rest of her life, she wore black in mourning and tended the garden at the site of the former house. After her death in 1989, the family finally took the weathered, worn billboard down. The surviving Sodder children, joined by their own children, continued to publicize the case and investigate leads. They, along with older Fayetteville residents, have theorized that the Sicilian Mafia was trying to extort money from George and the children may have been taken by someone who knew about the planned arson and said they would be safe if they left the house. They were possibly taken back to Italy. If the children had survived all those years and were aware that their parents and siblings had survived too, the family believes, they may have avoided contact in order to keep them from harm. , Sylvia Sodder Paxton, the youngest in the family, is the only surviving Sodder sibling who was in the house on the night of the fire, which she says is her earliest memory. \\"I was the last one of the kids to leave home\\", she recalled to the Gazette-Mail in 2013. She and her father often stayed up late, talking about what might have happened. \\"I experienced their grief for a long time\\". She still believes that her siblings survived that night, and quietly assists with efforts to find them and publicize the case. Her daughter said in 2006: \\"She promised my grandparents she wouldn't let the story die, that she would do everything she could\\". In the 21st century, these efforts have come to include online forums like websleuths.com in addition to media coverage. The increase in the latter has led some who have examined the case to believe that the children did, in fact, die in 1945. George Bragg, a local author who wrote about the case in his 2012 book West Virginia's Unsolved Murders, believes that John was telling the truth in his original account, when he said he tried to physically awaken his siblings before fleeing the house. He allows that that conclusion may still not be correct. \\"Logic tells you they probably did burn up in the fire, but you can't always go by logic\\". Stacy Horn, who did a segment on the case for National Public Radio around its 60th anniversary in 2005, also believes the children's death in the fire is the most plausible solution. In a contemporaneous post on her blog with material she had to cut from her story for time, she noted that the fire had continued to smolder all night after the house collapsed and that two hours was not enough time to search the ash thoroughly. Even if it had been, the firefighters may not have known what to look for. \\"However\\", she said, \\"there is enough genuine weirdness about this whole thing ... that if someday it is learned that the children did not die in the fire I won't be shocked\\".

She used her maternal identity to develop her vocation in the middle of the twentieth century. Originally, she and her husband, James Dickson (1900-1967), were sent by the Presbyterian Church of Canada, to Taiwan in 1927. Lillian lived and worked in Taiwan until she died, except for the period between 1940 and 1947 when she and her husband were transferred to British Guiana because of growing tensions and war between Japan and the United States. After her return to Taiwan, Lillian eventually developed a long lasting career as an independent missionary. In particular, she founded Mustard Seed International. and The Mustard Seed Mission (based in Taiwan).  Early life  Dickson was born Lillian Ruth LeVesconte on January 29, 1901 in Prior Lake, Minnesota to John, \\"a flour-and-feed-mill operator\\", and Lillie Belle LeVesconte. She met her husband, James Ira Dickson, during her time at Macalester College. On May 16, 1927, Dickson and James married. As both were members of the Canadian Presbyterian Church (CPC) and were interested in doing missionary work, the newly-wed Dicksons answered CPC's urgent call to provide pastoral and medical care to a CPC base in northern Taiwan.  Education  At 23, Dickson received her Bachelor of Arts from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. A year after, Dickson attended a Biblical Seminary in New York City, New York for two years to prepare for pending missionary work. For her trip to Taiwan, Dickson planned to take medical courses in preparation to become the family doctor in the village they intended to live in Taiwan, as there was a lack of good medical care for lepers. However, Dickson reflected in her letters to her husband later during her missionary work in Taiwan, \\"Nothing I studied in college is of any use here,...All the things I should know I learn by painful mistakes! Who would have ever guessed our life would be like this?\\" (1997-5006-2-1; circular letter dated May 15, 1959).  Missionary work   Work in Formosa before World War II  Dickson arrived in Taiwan in 1927 as a missionary under the Canadian Presbyterian Church. Lillian Dickson arrived as a participant in the Legacy of the American missionary movement. She lived through the Japanese colonial period and the Chinese nationalist era in Taiwan. During the Dicksons' first thirteen years in Formosa, now known as Taiwan, Dickson lived and worked as a missionary's wife. Her husband, James, served as deputy principal of Tamsui Middle School and then as president of Taipei Theological School. Dickson would host guests in their house and maintained the hospitable character of a missionary's wife. Due to rising tensions in World War II between Japan and the United States, the Dicksons left Taiwan and were reassigned to what is now British Guiana in South America.  Work in Taiwan after World War II  At the end of World War II, the Dicksons returned to Formosa. Lillian's husband continued his role as head administrator of the Taiwan Theological College. As Lillian's children were older, Lillian no longer held much obligations as missionary's wife. Dickson became a spokesperson for both Taiwan and the U.S., promoting peace and positive Japanese relations. Beyond that, Dickson advocated for the welfare of the needy Taiwanese people through an exchange of information and images in her letters she would write to her family, friends, and Churches in the US. By highlighting the needs of the Taiwanese people, she encouraged American organizations to donate to the people of Formosa. Christian organizations most helpful to Dickson at the time included the Christian Herald, a New York-based news organization, and World Vision, a charitable foundation created to rescue orphans after the Korean War. After repeated encouragement from her friends, Lillian Dickson established the non-profit Mustard Seed, Inc. organization in order for her donors to apply for tax deductions in 1954 and founded The Mustard Seed Mission to continue her work in Taiwan in 1962.  Medical missionary work  Upon Dickson's return to Taiwan, her intent was to evangelize the Taiwanese children. However, it was her medical missions that attracted her American donors. While she was not herself a licensed medical professional, Dickson's organization provided medical care and promoted hygiene through several missions executed over her lifetime. Some examples of missions included: developing mountain clinics, building a church in a leper colony, and establishing a clinic. Lillian Dickson's medical missionary work started with her focus on the leper patients and their children in the leper hospitals. When the children remained with their parents who were affected by leprosy, it was evident the children were at high risk of contracting the disease. Dickson found that when the children were separated at birth from their parents and were permitted to grow healthy. Hence, Dickson established a An-Lok Babies' Home to house the newborn babies with parents who had leprosy. From then on, Lillian Dickson went to create expansive leper colonies, and other clinics that focused on other diseases affected by the aboriginal people of Formosa. In 1955, the leprosarium Lillian Dickson served had over 800 patients alone. Dickson served as nurse, medical educator and religious missionary. When she traveled to the mountain clinics, she would bring medicine and provide medical care for the indigenous Taiwanese Tayal people who came from all parts of the mountain. She would treat medical sores, infections, cases of pneumonia and bronchitis, scabies, along with other ailments. Dickson would also teach the nurses at the clinics how to provide the specific treatments needed. Beyond that, as Dickson treated patients, she would recount biblical stories and sing loving gospels to the patients, which she claimed the indigenous people of the mountain would, \\"answer with warm, impetuous friendship.\\"  Additional missionary work  Beyond her medical care, Lillian Dickson's The Mustard Seed Mission in Taiwan included other branches that served the citizens of Taiwan. During her time, Dickson developed a Boy's Home for young boys were caught for committing petty crimes. Dickson also helped parents who had children out of wedlock which were marked on their certificates of identification. Due to the social stigma against these kinds of families, children were considered illegitimate and denied access to school and the parents had difficulty finding work. Dickson helped the parents find work and the children gain access to schools.  Criticism of Communism  Dickson was firmly against communism. Taiwan was introduced in the United States as \\"Free China,\\" or a place to combat Communism and the best location to preach the Christian faith in Asia. She is quoted in Angel at Her Shoulder saying \\"a wealthy America should rescue a poverty-stricken free China to combat their shared enemy of Communism\\" along with efforts against burdens of disease. Her autobiography These My People states that \\"sometimes we forget our threatening enemy, forget that the fiery dart of communism is aimed at our hearts.\\" Throughout her personal writings, she expressed anxiety over the system of government in relation to her missionary work. In fact, she proposed friendly relationships between the United States and Japan to defeat communism as a common enemy.  Legacy  Dickson founded the interdenominational Mustard Seed International (MSI) and The Mustard Seed Mission (MSM) to support her missionary work, which included caring for orphans in Formosa. She founded several orphanages and children's homes, describing herself as \\"the old woman who lived in a shoe—only I've got more shoes.\\" She helped establish MSI- sponsored kindergartens, elementary, middle and high schools. Furthermore, her work has led to Bible college and seminary training for pastors, lay leaders and church planting teams, and medical care in clinics and hospitals. Dickson continued to return to the U.S. for speaking tours until 1978, and consistently recruited support by discussing the tremendous needs of Taiwan through interviews on television and through other media. Children She had a total of 4 children, two of whom lived. She adopted a fifth. * Unnamed son - Sep 1928 (stillbirth) * Jeanna Naome - (Jul - Aug 1929) * Ronald James Dickson (1930 - 1982) * Marilyn Ruth (Dickson) Tank (1932 - ) * Bi-lian “Mei-ling” Dickson - adopted in Formosa c. 1950s Death Dickson died in Taipei, Taiwan on January 14, 1983 at the age of 81, of natural causes.

Note the single naupliar eye and the green intestinal region from the main diet of micro algae. Tigriopus brevicornis (often called a Tigger-pod) is a coastal marine copepod. They are a dominant member of shallow supra tidal rock pools along the North Western European coastline. A broad range of studies have been carried out on this species, including: its ecology, physiology, phylogeography, metapopulation genetics, development and reproductive behaviour. T. brevicornis has also recently been used in ecotoxicology studies and has been trialled as a live feed for larvae in several aquaculture-based studies for the past 30 years.Theilacker, G. H., & Kimball, a. S. (1984). Comparative quality of rotifers and copepods as foods for larval fishes. California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations Reports, 25(August 1983), 80–86. https://swfsc.noaa.gov/publications/CR/1984/8491.PDF  Environment and Ecology  This species of harpacticoid copepod is found in high shore splash pools on coastlines ranging from Portugal in the south to Iceland and Nova Scotia in the north. Sometimes it can be found below the high tide mark however, like in Sweden, where it was found at depths of 10 metres in the subtidal.Handschumacher, L., Steinarsdóttir, M. B., Edmands, S., & Ingólfsson, A. (2010). Phylogeography of the rock-pool copepod Tigriopus brevicornis (Harpacticoida) in the northern North Atlantic, and its relationship to other species of the genus. Marine Biology, 157(6), 1357–1366. http://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1415-7 These splash pools occur several metres above the high tide mark, isolated from the main coastal water as a microenvironment that can vary dramatically in chemical factors such as salinity, temperature and oxygen levels over relatively short temporal scales. T. brevicornis has the ability to survive these variable environmental conditions (factors that limit predators such as fish to lower pools in the intertidal zone) and as a result is known as a euryhaline osmoconformer. Temperatures in supratidal splash pools tend to track air temperatures more closely than ocean temperatures as they are often extremely shallow (only a few cm deep to a few meters deep). Salinity also changes as the pools evaporate or fill up (from 0-150 PSU) as the pools receive freshwater inputs from rain (especially so in the West of Ireland) and saltwater from wave action during spring tides or storm surges.McAllen, R. J., Taylor, A. C., & Davenport, J. (1998). Osmotic and body density response in the Harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis in supralittoral rock pools. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 78(04), 1143–1153. Retrieved from http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0025315400044386 The orange pigment Astaxanthin is synthesised by the organism as an aid against UVAR and UVBR radiation from the sun, as rock pools can be quite exposed to desiccation. The copepod's diet of phytoplankton who are rich in Highly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (HUFAs) allow them to synthesise this protective protein, granting them tolerance to radiation year-round.Davenport, J., Healy, A., Casey, N., & Heffron, J. J. a. (2004). Diet-dependent UVAR and UVBR resistance in the high shore harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 276(1), 299–303. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps276299 Within the pools, these relatively small (~1 mm long adult) organisms can thrive as generalist benthic foragers, feeding primarily on biofilms of phytoplankton and other microbes on the rock pool bed. They also feed on pelagic phytoplankton present in the water and on epiphytic biofilms covering the dominant rock pool alga; Enteromorpha intestinalis. Aside from a feeding platform, T. brevicornis take advantage of the algae's hollow nature and are known to dwell within the actual thallus of the green macroalga. Especially during times of desiccation, the thallus provides a moist refugium for the copepod when rock pools completely dry out. Several hundred individuals can be found in a single strand of the hollow seaweed, where they can survive weeks longer compared to natural desiccation. Even when Enteromorpha spp. aren't present in splash pools and conditions are getting too dry, the copepod can burrow down where the loose sandstone still holds moisture. These behavioural adaptations may be a key explanation in how this species can live and thrive in such an environment as extreme and as variable as the supratidal.McAllen, R. (1999). Enteromorpha intestinalis-a refuge for the supralittoral rockpool harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 79(6), 1125–1126. http://doi.org/10.1017/S0025315499001393 Part of the Harpacticoid copepods of the genus Tigriopus Norman 1868, T. brevicornis belong to the subclass Copepoda which is of high ecological importance. Copepoda is the second largest Crustacean taxa and approximately 12,000 species of copepods have been described. They are one of the dominant taxa in aquatic zooplankton communities representing 70% of the ocean’s biomass and thus the principal link between the phytoplankton and higher trophic levels. Harpacticoids also play an important role in the marine meiobenthic food web, especially as food for juvenile fish.Raisuddin, S., Kwok, K. W. H., Leung, K. M. Y., Schlenk, D., & Lee, J. S. (2007). The copepod Tigriopus: A promising marine model organism for ecotoxicology and environmental genomics. Aquatic Toxicology, 83(3), 161–173. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.04.005  Phylogeography, Metapopulation and Genetics studies Supratidal splash pools are often so high on the shoreline that they can become isolated from the coastal water and neighbouring pools for long periods of time. From this, scientists have speculated whether these neighbouring pools actually have different populations of copepods, and found that some pools only metres apart may never share genes through cross breeding.Van Wormhoudt, A. (2015). Seasonal and Cyclical Changes in Genetic Composition of the Marine Intertidal Rock Pool Copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Biochemical Genetics, 53(4-6), 79–92. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10528-015-9674-0 The upper shore rock pool mosaic with interspersed copepod communities therefore forms a metapopulation. This is a rare occurrence in a marine system, where dispersal ability is usually less impaired.Johnson, M. P. (2001). Metapopulation dynamics of Tigriopus brevicornis (Harpacticoida) in intertidal rock pools. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 211, 215–224. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps211215Altermatt, F., Bieger, A., & Morgan, S. (2012). Habitat characteristics and metapopulation dynamics of the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 468, 85–93. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps09994 This extremely restricted dispersal has perplexed researchers, as phylogeographical studies have shown that despite this, distant relatives of T. brevicornis were capable of occasional long distance transport, colonising large geographic areas within the last 12 to 15 thousand years. A 1 mm long copepod somehow managed to traverse the Atlantic Ocean in the past - over 4000 kilometres.  Reproduction and Development  T. brevicornis undergoes several stages of development, with 12 distinctive post-embryonic developmental stages; 6 naupliar (copepod baby) stages, 5 copepodid (teenage) stages and an adult stage. Animals are sexually dimorphic and males are usually slightly smaller than females, possessing enlarged antennules. These antennules are used to perform a characteristic mate-guarding behaviour to secure a potential mate, where they grasp females before the actual mating event. Mating pairs will stay attached for several hours, and sperm is stored in a special organ known as a spermatheca. Females are highly fecund and usually bear multiple broods of eggs developed sequentially after a single mating with brood sizes of 30–50 nauplii. Fertilised T. brevicornis females are easily identifiable by the presence of a large dark egg sac attached to their hind segment. Other Tigriopus spp. females have varying numbers of egg sacs attached posteriorly (see image below).Fraser, J.H., 1936. The occurrence, ecology and life history of Tigriopus fulvus (Fischer). J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U.K. 20, 523–536. Different developmental stages of the marine harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis and a mating pair - Male grasping female. T. brevicornis female with characteristic single posterior egg sac.  Behaviour  Studies on different behavioural traits of this species has been useful for understanding how it survives in its extreme environment.  Swimming and Feeding Although classed as a benthic copepod, this particular species of Tigriopus is surprisingly motile, and has been noted to spend prolonged amounts of time in the water column of experimental mesocosms.De Troch, M., Chepurnov, V. a., Vincx, M., & Ólafsson, E. (2008). The effect of Fucus vesiculosus on the grazing of harpacticoid copepods on diatom biofilms. Journal of Sea Research, 60(3), 139–143. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2008.05.005 While copepodites (adults) have six pairs of cephalic appendages used for swimming and food collection and up to five pairs of specialized ‘‘swimming legs’’ allocated for jumping, nauplii have only three pairs of appendages to be used for motion and feeding. Therefore, the kinematics of nauplii is different from that of adults. They have a swimming-by-jumping propulsion mode, with alternating power and recovery strokes of three pairs of cephalic appendages. This is fundamentally different from the way other microplankton move, and the propulsion efficiency of the nauplii is low.Andersen Borg, C. M., Bruno, E., & Kiørboe, T. (2012). The Kinematics of Swimming and Relocation Jumps in Copepod Nauplii. PLoS ONE, 7(10), 33–35. http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047486 Very early T. brevicornis naupliar stages tend to crawl on the substrate they are feeding on, and this may hinder their motility even further. An interesting trait of some nauplii is to beat their appendages while being stationary, which results in the creation of a strong feeding current that is about 10 times faster than the average translation speed of the nauplius. More efficient feeding is a result of this clever adaptation.Bruno, E., Andersen Borg, C. M., & Kiørboe, T. (2012). Prey Detection and Prey Capture in Copepod Nauplii. PLoS ONE, 7(10), 1–8. http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047906  Cannibalism  Adult T. brevicornis have been shown to eat the first two developmental stages of nauplii (N1 and N2) when population densities are high or when food availability is low. Speculation concerning the females' ability to recognise their own young and therefore not eat them is no longer supported, as more recent studies have indicated that this kin recognition does not exist within the genus Tigriopus. This is further supported by the fact that T. brevicornis produce several large broods of eggs per year, and any form of parental care would be highly unlikely given their huge energy investment in producing so many offspring.Gallucci, F., & Ólafsson, E. (2007). Cannibalistic behaviour of rock-pool copepods: An experimental approach for space, food and kinship. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 342(2), 325–331. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2006.11.004  Applications  Given the species' high natural abundances and their occurrence as a nuisance species in some brine shrimp / rotifer aquaculture tanks, these copepods were further researched as a potential live feed for larviculture thereafter.  Aquaculture  T. brevicornis and many other copepod species have been analysed for their effectiveness as a live feed in marine larviculture (larvae aquaculture). Essentially, the larval stage of most fish and crustaceans is the most important for healthy growth and development into an economically feasible human commodity. When the fish larvae are fed with traditional feeds of brine shrimp or rotifers, these larvae can develop growth defects and malpigmentation can also occur.Støttrup, J. G. (2006). A Review on the Status and Progress in Rearing Copepods for Marine Larviculture . Advantages and Disadvantages . Among Calanoid , Harpacticoid and Cyclopoid Copepods. Avances En Nutrición Acuícola VIII, (October), 62–83 Copepods are rich in Highly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (HUFAs) which are essential for optimal fish larvae growth and development. The copepod is a product, reared in huge hundred litre tanks, fed with nearby-cultured micro algae and the nauplii would be constantly filtered out, leaving the adults and copepodites (teenagers) inside the mass culture vessels. These naulpii would be introduced to the larval rearing tanks where the larvae preferentially eat the nauplii.Drillet, G., Frouël, S., Sichlau, M. H., Jepsen, P. M., Højgaard, J. K., Joardeer, A. K., & Hansen, B. W. (2011). Status and recommendations on marine copepod cultivation for use as live feed. Aquaculture. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.02.027 Reasons for T. brevicornis's effectiveness as a live feed are numerous: * They have a generally short body size ( for adults and nauplii are ~75 µm).Støttrup, J. G. (2000). The elusive copepods: Their production and suitability in marine aquaculture. Aquaculture Research, 31(8-9), 703–711. http://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2000.00488.x * They can reach high population growth rates (independent of high densities) with relatively short generation times (~ 3 to 4 weeks) all of which can be attained in mass culture systems. Scanning image of a Western Irish population of Tigriopus brevicornis. After death, the Orange pigment Astaxanthin becomes intensified. * Nauplii and adults swim in the water column, except the first two naupliar stages who crawl on the substratum. * Cannibalism only occurs by adults on the first two naupliar stages, which can be avoided by the aforementioned filtration system. * Cheap and versatile feeding due to their generalistic feeding habits - they have the ability to transform simple sugars into complex biomolecules. They will eat anything from baker's yeast to fruit juice to any formulated fish feed.Ajiboye, O., Yakubu, A. F., Adams, T. E., Olaji, E. D., & Nwogu, N. A. (2011). A review of the use of copepods in marine fish larviculture. Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries. http://doi.org/10.1007/s11160-010-9169-3 * Rich presence of Highly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (HUFAs) when fed microalgae. This HUFA content can be maintained even after the individual has been frozen at -80 degrees Celsius and processed into a commercial paste to maximise transport potential and shelf life.Olivotto, I., Tokle, N. E., Nozzi, V., Cossignani, L., & Carnevali, O. (2010). Preserved copepods as a new technology for the marine ornamental fish aquaculture: A feeding study. Aquaculture, 308(3-4), 124–131. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.08.033 * Extreme stress tolerance allows the species to be grown in many different conditions and locations around the globe.

He was influenced early on by the mathematically inspired work of M. C. Escher, but never had any formal art training. Suter attended a number of different colleges, not graduating from any of them. Drafted into the Army during the Vietnam War, he spent his deployment in West Germany. Upon returning to the U.S., Suter got work at The Washington Post as an illustrator, for a while working as a courtroom artist during the Watergate scandal trials. Suter was awarded a Michigan Journalism Fellowship in 1977, where he spent a year studying fine art, philosophy, and history\\"Past Fellows: 1977–1978,\\" Knight-Wallace Fellows at Michigan website. Accessed Dec. 2, 2015. at the University of Michigan. Upon completion of the fellowship, in 1978, Suter moved to New York City to pursue editorial illustration full-time. He quickly become sought-after by such publications as The New York Times (both on the op-ed page and the book review), Time magazine (for whom he did a number of covers), Harper's Magazine, and the Chicago Tribune. In a mid-1980s magazine profile, Suter described his work this way: For many years, Suter has been working on creating a full-length animation of the complete text of Shakespeare's Hamlet.Kraus, Jerelle. All the Art That's Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn't): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page (Columbia University Press, 2013), p. 82. In the late 2000s he retired from editorial illustration to work full-time on his painting and sculpture practices.

Designers are required to invest time and resources to contest with each other to win a contract. This type of practice is common in industries such as arts and architecture. In design contest, which is an example of speculative work, the client provided participating designers with a brief prize for the eventual winner. They will then submit their work so that the client can select a winning submission. As the winner receives the prize and contract, other entrants receive nothing for their work.  Histories  AIGA holds the belief that professional designers should be compensated fairly for their work. Also there should be an engagement with clients in which the ownership and use rights of the designer's intellectual and creative property are negotiated. To achieve that end, AIGA suggest that designers should enter into the projects of their clients with full engagement to show the true value of their creative endeavor. They should pay more attention when it comes to potential risks of entering into speculative work. The risks of speculative work make some designers feel the repulsion of Crowdsourcing Creative Work.  Categories   Competitions  Designers work in the hopes of winning a prize that comes in an unknown form.  Volunteer work  Designers submit their work as a favor or for the experience without the expectation of being awarded.  Internships  Designers work in the form of volunteer that involves educational gain which could benefit them in further career development.  Pro bono work  Designers work for free for the public good.  Cons and pros   Pros  One main attraction of using speculative work is that it can benefit the clients by bringing cheaper cost and more variations and ideas. As for designers, speculative work can provide them with an opportunity to gain experience, build portfolio, and meet people.  Cons   Efficiency  The fact that designers spend countless hours working on projects without any forms of payment guaranteed is harmful to them. Designers could have used their resources to build portfolios, improve their skills, or make a contract with actual payment.  Plagiarism  Verbal agreement is insufficient in protecting designer's interests in the court of law. As a matter of fact, it is extremely difficult to prove that designers are supposed to be compensated by the clients without formal contracts. Using this strategy, some clients make little changes and then resell the designer's creative work as their own properties.  Quality  Some designers focus on undercharging their products rather than improving the quality of the work. This situation is even more severe when designers try to outbid each other's to get payment in the contest. It devalues the whole skill-set in the design industry.

The Hamburg Temple disputes () were the two controversies which erupted around the Israelite Temple in Hamburg, the first permanent Reform synagogue, which elicited fierce protests from Orthodox rabbis. The events were a milestone in the coalescence of both modern perceptions of Judaism. The primary occurred between 1818 and 1821, and the latter from 1841 to 1842. First dispute Background The Jacobson Temple (right), Seesen. In the latter half of the 18th Century, Jews in the German principalities were experiencing a profound transformation. Communal corporate privileges and obligations, along with those of all other groups in society, were gradually abolished by the enlightened absolutist authorities, attempting to create centralized states. Economic and civil restrictions were lifted piecemeal. A process of acculturation commenced, at a time when rabbinical courts and communal elders imperceptibly lost their means to enforce Jewish law (Halakha), like the anathema, and legitimacy to wield them. In Hamburg, the government checked the jurisdiction of the strictly conservative Rabbi Raphael Cohen after repeated complaints from transgressors he punished – people who ate non-kosher food, a priest who married a woman forbidden to him via deception and the like – contributing to his decision to resign in 1799.Jacob Katz, Out of the Ghetto: The Social Background of Jewish Emancipation, 1770-1870, Syracuse University Press, 1973. pp. 144-152. The more cultured Jews were also inspired by Enlightenment ideals, forming the small and short-lived Haskalah movement, though the influence of those was meager in comparison to the more prosaic, aforementioned factors. Growing swaths of German Jewry were becoming nonobservant and apathetic towards their religion.David J. Sorkin, Enlightenment and Emancipation : German Jewry’s Formative Age in Comparative Perspective, in: Comparing Jewish Societies. Ed.: Todd M. Endelman. University of Michigan Press, 1997. pp. 1-12. Concurrently, along the principle voiced by the comte de Clermont-Tonnerre, \\"We must refuse everything to the Jews as a nation and accord everything to Jews as individuals... they should not be allowed to form in the state either a political body or an order\\", French Jews were emancipated in 1791. In 1806, the Grand Sanhedrin in Paris declared them no longer tolerated aliens, considered a foreign nation for centuries, but \\"Frenchmen of Mosaic Faith.\\" All quarters in German Jewry, even the most Orthodox, gradually embraced local culture and national identification, both due to hope for the same equality and government coercion. Some circles concluded that this process must be total, and that Judaism had to be purged from any element that was or could be interpreted as political, and become strictly confessional.Baruch Mevorah, Messianism as a Factor in the First Reform Controversies, Zion, Historical Society of Israel, 1969. pp. 189-193. This sentiment combined with aversion from beliefs and practices that could no longer be rationalized or fit modern sensitivities, and conviction that the young generation would commit apostasy – as many among the more acculturated were doing – unless religion will be thoroughly refashioned. An impetus for reform permeated the progressive strata. Several radical maskilim, like Lazarus Bendavid and David Friedländer, suggested reducing Judaism to little more than Deism, though they had barely any influence.Michael A. Meyer, Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism, Wayne State University Press, 1995. pp. 17-25. In 1806, the Kassel-based journal Sulamith published an anonymous article which offered, for the first known time, a revolutionary reformulation of Jewish messianic belief. The author suggested that Samuel of Nehardea's statement this world differs from the Messianic Era only in respect to the Servitude of Israel to the Nations meant that emancipation was tantamount to divine redemption. He detached it from the ancient precepts of a personal redeemer who will reign as king and lead the exiled back to Zion, as the Temple will be rebuilt and the sacrificial cult restored.Mevorah, pp. 194-195. In 1808, the in the Kingdom of Westphalia was established. Headed by Israel Jacobson and Rabbi Mendel Steinhardt, it was created by the government of Jérôme Bonaparte to facilitate a civic betterment of the Jews. Jacobson, though an avowed modernist, had little ideological consistency in the religious sphere (though the very idea that Judaism could be limited to a \\"religious sphere\\" was yet new and revolutionary to most). He was influenced by the aesthetic concepts of Christian worship, quite alien to Ashkenazi Jews at the time: decorum, devotion, formality and sobriety; but he did not cross the line into principled issues.Meyer, Respone, pp. 30-33. Even the ritual reforms he implemented in synagogues were quite innocuous, and were mostly adopted by Neo-Orthodox rabbis later.Michael K. Silber, Orthodoxy, The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe. On 17 July 1810, Jacobson opened a prayer house in Seesen, to serve the modern Jewish school he founded earlier. He named it \\"temple\\", a rather common designation at the time, borrowed from the French and used also by traditional Jewish houses of prayer.Meyer, Response, p. 42. Certain that the lack of decorum drove the young away from synagogue, he abridged the service, introduced both prayers and an edifying sermon in German (very different from the old talmudic discourse in Yiddish), and confirmation ceremony for children. Contrary to prevalent custom, no lattice hid from view the women sitting separately at the upper story. A choir and an organ accompanied the prayer: instrumental music in synagogue was almost unknown among Ashkenazim, and the organ was strongly associated with church services. Another feature was the use of Sephardic pronunciation, deemed more aesthetic than the traditional Ashkenazi one.Meyer, Response, pp. 36-39. Admiration for the acculturated and integrated Sephardim of Western Europe, whose emancipation was rather a formality as they already enjoyed extensive privileges, was a central element in the worldview of their Central European brethren, both of the moderate and radical cast, hoping to emulate them. It inspired the Haskalah to a great measure. The old pronunciation was associated with the Jews of Poland, considered backward and superstitious.Ismar Schorsch, The Myth of Sephardic Supremacy, Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook (1989) 34: 1. pp. 55-57. Jacobson's temple elicited barely any protest. Baruch Mevorah noted that all the reforms introduced lacked either consistency or an ideological undertone.Mevorah, pp. 197. In 1812, Friedländer penned \\"Ein Wort zu seinr Zeit\\" (\\"A Timely Word\\"). Along with exhortation for thorough reforms in all spheres, he added that the classic Messianic belief was no longer tenable or rational, enjoining Jews to excise any mention of it from their liturgy. Another progressive leader, Abraham Muhr of Breslau, rebuked Friedländer in his pamphlet \\"Jerubaal\\", published a year afterwards. He accused him of unscrupulous opportunism and disregard for tradition. On the Messianic issue, Muhr wrote that it must be retained, especially as omission would evoke a harsh response from many. He offered instead to emphasize the universalist aspects of this belief, while obfuscating the particularist ones. Mevorach observed that Muhr elucidated what was to become a tenet of nascent Reform Judaism: preserving the Messianic ideal, yet transforming it into \\"a Jewish hope for a universal redemption of all mankind.\\"Mevorah, pp. 199-201. Berlin and the Radiance of Justice The Palais Itzig, where Jacobson held his first service in Berlin. The Consistory closed in 1813. Jacobson moved to Berlin, where he soon became acquainted with local Jewish notables who shared his persuasion regarding the necessity of reform in services. He was supported by the wealthy Jacob Herz Beer, father of Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Ruben Samuel Gumpertz. On Shavuot (14 June) 1815, they opened a private prayer association in the residence of Daniel Itzig. It was attended by four hundred people. Copying most of Seesen's innovations, it had decorum, vestments for the cantor, confirmation, a choir and an organ playing on the feast day – operated by a gentile, which they assumed was a sufficient measure to avoid desecrating it by work – and the like. Mevorach emphasized that their abbreviated liturgy, though it dropped several segments, yet again bore no principled undertone. Michael Meyer commented that \\"like reforms in Westphalia, those in Berlin were limited to externals and dominated by aesthetic considerations.\\" The private services were a great success. Leopold Zunz, who visited them on the Yom Kippur, commented that \\"people who did not attend a synagogue in twenty years spent the entire holiday inside; most of the young fasted.\\" Due to lack of space, Beer began conducting similar prayers also in his Spandauer Straße 72 mansion.Michael A. Meyer, The Origins of the Modern Jew: Jewish Identity and European Culture in Germany, 1749-1824, Wayne State University Press, 1979. p. 133-137. The established congregation of Berlin viewed all this with apprehension. Rabbi Akiva Eger of Posen, perhaps the generation's greatest halakhic authority, published a short rebuke. He condemned the use of German in prayer, though not any other innovation, and castigated the Berlin group for wishing to emulate the \\"Ordinances of the Gentiles\\" (\\"neither shall ye walk in their ordinances\\"). The chief rabbi of Berlin, Meyer Simon Weyl, launched a formal protest to the government, utilizing a legal clause that allowed prayer only in the single recognized synagogue. On orders of King Frederick William III, both private temples were closed on 9 December 1815. Beer concluded that the only possible course of action was to vie for influence in the main prayerhouse.Moshe Samet, he-Ḥadash asur min ha-Torah : peraḳim be-toldot ha-ortodoḳsyah, Dinur Center for Jewish History, 2005. pp. 236-238. Seeking approbation for the reformed service, he sent enquiries to several rabbis in Italy, where he had business contacts. He did not explicitly describe the situation in Berlin, but vaguely asked about the permissibility of various practices. Italian communities, well acculturated and integrated, served as a matter of particular interest to German Jews, apart to their penchant for all things Sephardic. They had a long tradition of instrumental music in their synagogues, since the days of Salamone Rossi, making them an excellent precedent.Lois C. Dubin, The Rise and Fall of the Italian Jewish Model in Germany: From Haskalah to Reform, in: John M. Efron ed., Jewish History and Jewish Memory: Essays in Honor of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, UPNE, 1998. pp. 275-277. Beer's correspondents replied around December 1816. On several matters, all were unanimous: communities often had several synagogues, each with its own rite, thus lending him support against accusations of sectarianism (lo titgodedu, the ban on separating oneself from communal norms and institutions); sermons were delivered in the vernacular; the congregation repeated the prayer silently while only the cantor raised his voice, and musical instruments were quite often used. On the organ, the rabbis of Mantua answered they never used it but knew that other communities once did, and therefore it could not have been prohibited. Most other responses are lost, but according to later statements by their authors, those were more stringent. Rabbi Jacob Emanuel Cracovia of Venice and Emanuel Castelnuovo of Padua permitted the organ in synagogues, but not during prayer lest it interfere with the enunciation of formulae. They allowed it only on weekdays and if it be handled by a Jewish musician. Both grounded their opinions on precedent in cities in Italy and France, and even on Jacobson's Seesen temple. The most positive response was received from Jacob Hay Recanati, chief rabbi of Verona, who completely endorsed the organ and even directly referred to its use on the Sabbath, allowing it as long as it was done by a gentile. Another such was composed by Shem-Tov Samum of Leghorn, whose lettre came with the approbation of the local rabbinical court, of which he himself was an occasional member. Samun did not mention the Sabbath, but he did delineate the core issues that could be used against music. He stated playing it could not be considered \\"emulating the Gentiles\\", as Decisor Joseph Colon Trabotto only applied the rule to that which had no positive value of its own. He also rebutted the possible argument that it breached the Beatified Sages' ban on music after the Ruin of Jerusalem, providing ample precedent and citations that this was meant against revelry alone.Dobin, pp. 277-281. In summer 1817, the Berlin Old Synagogue was closed down for renovation. Beer reopened his private association during August, drawing large crowds once more. At the same time, Israel Eduard Kley, a member of Jacobson's circle who served as preacher, left Berlin to assume the management of the new Jewish school in Hamburg. In the Hanseatic city he found a large audience interested in a reformed service. Kley was joined Seckel Isaac Fränkel and Meyer Israel Bresselau, community notables who were also scholars of considerable merit, and Gotthold Salomon, a pedagogue who would become their preacher. They garnered support among the young and educated, and especially the women, who were barely taught Hebrew under traditional conventions and could not understand the prayers. On 17 December 1817, 65 Jewish households founded the \\"New Temple Association\\", which raised funds for the planned synagogue.Meyer, Response, pp. 47-51. In the early months of 1818, tension was mounting in Berlin. Rabbi Meyer Weyl, irritated by the Beer association, sent lettres of complaint to prominent Central European decisors in February and March. He wrote to Bezalel Ronsburg of Prague and Mordecai Benet of Nikolsburg, asking both to contact the Italian rabbis and request that they retract their responsa. He also turned to Akiba Eger for support, and the latter corresponded on the matter with his son-in- law, Moses Sofer of Pressburg, who was already famous for his intransigent Orthodoxy. Moshe Samet observed that the tone in the correspondence was rather calm, and debate still very theoretical: the rabbis outside Berlin were not yet much disturbed.Samet, pp. 255-256. Beer enlisted the aid of Eliezer Liebermann, an obscure figure who claimed to have once been a rabbinic judge in Hungary. Liebermann repeated his master's actions in 1816. He sent lettres to rabbis and scholars in his native land, reputed to be liberal. Eventually he received two that he found sufficiently lenient. One was from Moses Kunitz, a rabbinic judge from Óbuda, who composed a short, hesitant responsa in which he allowed the Sephardic pronunciation and the use of music instruments. He circumspectly commented that since it already was customary to have gentiles remove the plates and candles from tables on the Sabbath, having a non-Jew operate the organ on days of rest will not breach the Law.Samet, pp. 243-245. A far more comprehensive approbation was given by Rabbi Aaron Chorin of Arad. Chorin was a well-known maverick; Samet noted that unlike many colleagues who harbored maskilic sympathies, he did not keep his to himself. Since a rabbinic tribunal had him recant in 1806, under the pain of being declared a heretic and have his beard shaved, he clashed repeatedly with other decisors, adopting glaringly lenient positions. His only patron was Rabbi Moses Münz of Óbuda. When hearing of Liebermann's lettres, Münz warned Chorin to steer clear from the controversy, yet the latter ignored him. The rabbi of Arad composed a long, enthusiastic responsa, in which he fervently supported reform efforts, stating that he long regarded the noise and disorder in synagogues a great ill. While recommending they teach their sons the Holy Tongue, he noted that legal sources were quite clear on the permissibility of vernacular liturgy. He also allowed Sephardi pronunciation and separate prayer gatherings. Regarding the organ, he cited the same arguments that Samun and Recanati evoked. He also turned to two minority opinions mentioned in Orach Chayim 338:2 and 339:3, that sanctioned music on the Sabbath.Moshe Pelli, מילחמתו הרעיונית וההלכית של הרב אהרון חורין בעד ריפורמה דתית ביהדות, Hebrew Union College Annual, Volume 39, 1968. pp. 70-72; Samet, pp. 244-247. Liebermann added Chorin and Kunitz's lettres to those of Samun and Recanati, from which he removed the dates and openings that indicated they were from 1816.Dobin, p. 280. He published the four in a compendium titled \\"Radiance of Justice\\" (\\"Nogah ha-Tzedek\\"). He also authored a long concluding chapter, \\"Radiant Light\\" (\\"Or Nogah\\") where he denounced the rabbis of his day. Liebermann mixed enlightened notions with quotes from nonconformist Jewish medieval philosophers, especially Leon of Modena. He attacked decisors for demonstrating legalistic rigidity, arrogance and apathy as many of the young turned away from religion.Samet, pp. 250-252. A minor point he made was justifying less mourning and prayers about the Jerusalem Temple, arguing these also constituted Hastening the End.Mevorah, pp. 206. He did not spare common Jews either, blaming them for neglecting their children's religious education. Liebermann determined that some prayers should be recited in German, but only where people were ignorant of Hebrew.Samet, pp. 253. The pamphlet was a direct challenge to the rabbinical establishment. When \\"Radiance of Justice\\" appeared in Berlin it caused much controversy, owing mainly to Chorin's response, which was both enthusiastic and penned by a relatively high-ranking rabbi. On New Year (1–2 October) 1818, brawls between the Orthodox and Reform factions broke out in the main synagogue. However, it calmed quite soonly.Samet, pp. 257. Apart from being conservative in general, The Prussian authorities were concerned that any modification of Judaism would make it more attractive and reduce the rapid rate of conversions to Christianity. Goaded by Weyl, they quickly placed various limits on Beer and Gumperz. In 1823, the government permanently shut down the association. \\"Radiance of Justice\\" had little influence in Berlin; The \\"polemical storm\\" it did elicit, wrote Meyer, \\"swirled around the temple in Hamburg.\\"Meyer, Response, p. 51. Hamburg and The Words of the Covenant our obligatory sacrifices\\" and omitting the traditional \\"O gather our dispersions... Conduct us unto Zion\\" passage. On 18 October 1818, the \\"New Temple Association\\" inaugurated its synagogue, Qahal Bayit Chadash (\\"Congregation New House\\"), better known by its German name, Neuer Israelitischer Tempel, the New Israelite Temple. Apart from emulating virtually everything done in Berlin, they also reinstituted the ancient triennial cycle of Torah portions, as in old Israel, rather than the Babylonian annual one, thus shortening services. Soon after, Bresselau and Fränkel published a new prayerbook which they authored for the community, \\"Order of Devotion\\", Seder ha-Avodah. This work, unlike its predecessor in Berlin, did not introduce merely eclectic changes. As Meyer noted, it was the \\"first comprehensive Reform liturgy.\\" While not thoroughly systematic, the authors methodically excised or replaced segments referring to the future restoration of the sacrificial cult in Jerusalem by the Messiah. Some formulae pertaining to it were retained; in his later analysis, Simon Bernfeld argued that any expression that could have been interpreted metaphorically remained unscathed. The blessing \\"May our eyes see your return to Zion\\" was unchanged. Michael Meyer wrote: \\"The Reformers had not lost their love of Zion, but they did not desire to return or rebuild the Temple... Without question, the omission and alteration of Messianic passages was the most audacious innovation of the Hamburg reformers. It cast a doubt on a central principle of the Jewish faith.\\"Meyer, Response, pp. 56-57. Bresselau, Fränkel and those who shared their views did not yet possess a comprehensive, alternative religious philosophy. They attempted to justify themselves by precedent and halakhic means. Their approach was rationalistic, believing their interpretation was correct, and they lacked the historicist understanding of the founders of Reform Judaism, who would follow them a generation later. But their new rite, for the first time, reflected its earliest tenet, an explicitly universalized Messianism.Mevorah, pp. 208-211. The Hamburg rabbinical court, headed by the elderly judge Baruch ben Meir Oser of Prague (the city had no official rabbi since the death of Zebi Hirsch Zamosz in 1807), immediately proclaimed a ban on the new synagogue. The communal elders were divided. At the very same time, Liebermann's \\"Radiance of Justice\\" appeared. Though intended to defend the Berlin Reformers, the pamphlet could have served the same purpose in Hamburg, and public opinion was quick to perceive it as such.Jakob Josef Petuchowski, Prayerbook Reform in Europe: the Liturgy of European Liberal and Reform Judaism, World Union for Progressive Judaism, 1968. p. 86. Oser and the other judges found themselves facing both a large swath of their community and Liebermann's tract. In winter 1818, they sought help from outside, writing lettres to rabbis across Central Europe and appealing to Italy as well. On 4 December Oser wrote Sofer in Pressburg, requesting assistance against \\"those who have devised a new rite... It is evident that they do not wish to ascend to Zion.\\"Samet, p. 289. The response to the new temple was different than before. The Reform movement spread, establishing presence in a central Jewish community and mobilising rabbis in its service. It could not be dismissed as a handful of eccentrics any longer, with a genuine schism possible. The \\"Radiance of Justice\\" granted it legitimacy, undermining the authority of the Hamburg rabbis and potentially of the rabbinic establishment everywhere, demonstrating that halakhic scholars signed such a confrontational treatise.Samet, pp. 253-254. But beyond all that, \\"what severely disturbed the traditionalists\\" about the Reformers now, wrote Meyer, \\"was that they had not merely reinterpreted Messianism to tone down its particularism and reconcile it with patriotism. They had transferred it entirely and had given that expression in the prayerbook itself. The worship in Hamburg was for them a permanent substitute to the sacrificial cult in Jerusalem. For the champions of tradition, this was no mere heresy, it was a step beyond the pale.\\" The Hamburg Temple in its original edifice, at the Brunnenstraße. Already in January 1819, the Italian communities responded to Oser's petitions, severely condemning the reformers, clarifying that most only allowed the organ and other innovations on a theoretical level and that their responses were given in 1816, without being aware of the situation.Dobin, pp. 280-282. Rabbi Moses Sofer of Pressburg, who was to emerge as the foremost Orthodox leader during the dispute, requested Moses Münz to have Chorin recant. The latter relented under pressure, and wrote a retraction. He stated his rulings were sound, stressing that he reneged due to the omission of core prayers, of which he was ignorant. While extremely lenient, Chorin never withdrew from the belief in the restitution of sacrifices. Sofer eventually published only the retraction, without the self-exonerating preamble, enraging the rabbi of Arad. Chorin was also openly denounced by Mordecai Benet, who branded him unworthy of his title. Liebermann traveled across the Austrian Empire in late 1818, publicizing his views. While the Orthodox were in the midst of preparing a concerted condemnation of Kley's temple, he found support in Vienna, where local Jewish notables were interested in his suggestions. Communal elders considered building a new, Hamburg-inspired synagogue and appointing Chorin to head it. Another one intent to seize the moment was the radical maskil Peter Beer of Prague, who held views which far exceeded those of the Reformers, approaching Deism. Throughout 1819, he and his associate Herz Homberg petitioned the Imperial Court repeatedly to oblige the Jews to pray only in German. These moves heightened the traditionalist's sense of urgency. Even the moderate, relatively open Italian rabbis \\"shared their Central European colleagues' view that Judaism was imperiled, that the threat of schism was real.\\" Oser already received angered clarifications from several communities. But in March and April 1819, the most senior Italian authority, Rabbi Abraham Eliezer ha-Levi of Triest, journeyed the peninsula from his city as far south as Ragusa. In every community, he collected lettres of reprimand and condemnation against the Hamburg reformers. Shem-Tov Samun criticized \\"those who rebelled\\" against the rabbis and prevalent customs of their community. Recanati's response was not recorded. While not necessarily reneging on their former rulings, the Italians elucidated that they set many limitations and that those were more theoretical than concrete permits, adding harsh attacks against the \\"sectarians and schismatics\\". Lois C. Dubin argued that their stance was not just a reaction to the threat upon the authority of tradition and rabbinic jurisdiction: \\"they had always spoken on behalf of custom, continuity and tradition. In 1816, they had as well, drawing upon Italian practice and halakhic arguments... Though they were misconstrued as supporters of reform, they really did not favour the change of customary practice. What confused German modernizers was that they failed to see that the Italians were speaking from a different context and tradition. What was customary in one locale was innovative in the other; what looked radical here, could in fact be defended by tradition elsewhere.\\"Dobin, pp. 283-285. Ha-Levi, who summarized and edited the various Italian responsa, was exceptionally harsh. His final rulings, sent to Hamburg to bolster that of the local court and endorsed by fourteen communities (including Venice, Ferrara and Florence), forbade any musical accompaniment whatsoever, whether on weekdays or on the Sabbath. Even Oser and his two fellow judges only banned it on the day of rest and festivals. The traditionalist reaction to the Hamburg temple was delineated by several concerns. The Messianic issue was of supreme importance to the Orthodox, immeasurably more than any element which the \\"Radiance of Justice\\" sought to countenance. In a private tract he published later on, Rabbi Abraham Löwenstamm of Emden castigated those who abandoned this belief not only as heretics, but as worse from Christians and Muslims who at least believed in a redeemer, equal to Idolaters. However, this was a contentious matter that could be interpreted as disloyalty to the states in which they resided and be used against them. All references to the omission of these prayers were obfuscated and accompanied by long declarations of fealty to the kings and sovereigns, and explanations that this faith did not conflict with earnest patriotism and identification with the one's nation. Baruch Mevorach observed that no less than their opponents, the Orthodox, albeit clinging fiercely and dogmatically to the restoration of the sacrifices, return to Zion and every other detail, faced the need to dilute the particularist tinge of the redemption ideal. They too stressed universalist facets and the manner in which it would benefit all mankind, taking care to clarify that the yearning for the Temple was a utopian concept.Mevorah, pp. 207-214. In addition, the rabbis had to reassert their authority against those who sought to undermine it in general. The main theme underlying most of the lettres sent to Hamburg was not to contend with any specific components of the new worship style, but to deny the Israelite Temple and any attempt to emulate it legitimacy by reinforcing every feature of traditional conduct. The rulings often used arguments along the line of \\"the Custom of Israel is Law\\", and lambasted those who meddled with received forms and sought to abandon the ways of their ancestors. Quotes like \\"we cannot devise what our fathers did not contemplate\\", \\"cursed are those who innovate\\" and the like permeated the rulings. The most unremitting promulgator of this approach was Moses Sofer, who had long since declared that in an era of growing heresy, even the slightest minutiae of tradition had to be relentlessly upheld against those who sought to challenge rabbinic authority. In 1796, he protested that even something certainly known to be \\"custom of ignoramuses\\", prevalent only due to a mistake by the unlearned masses, must not be abrogated.Samet, pp. 283-290. The 1819 Hamburg controversy signified a new pattern of thought on the part of the conservatives, one that the rabbi of Pressburg already embraced. Their polemics were not a mere continuation of legalistic argumentation, but a self- conscious, concerted backlash intended to safeguard the very authority of tradition. As such, most historians regard it to be the beginning of Orthodox Judaism as a modern movement, a defined, beleaguered perception which could not merely perpetuate old modes of thought. It had to defend itself actively against encroaching deviation in a world where the rabbis lacked all their old legal means of enforcement. Sofer had no qualms about his ideology. Mordecai Benet, in his lettres to Hamburg, attempted to construe a complex halakhic defence of the exclusive use of Hebrew in prayer, enlisting both intricate mystical claims about the importance of enunciating the holy names and the need to preserve the language. These proved an easy target for the partisans of the temple. Sofer, however, blandly stated that the German prayers \\"were not of great significance\\", but banned them outright because it was an innovation, stressing the difference between him and the Reformers were a matter of principle, not of specific practices. He wanted to ban the organ on the same grounds, but eventually accepted Benet's argument it constituted \\"emulating the gentiles.\\"Samet, pp. 292-293. The decisors were also faced with another problem. An old report surfaced, revealing that the Maisel Synagogue in Prague employed an organ during the 17th Century and played to accompany Lekhah Dodi. In their polemic, they concluded that only one among Prague's nine synagogues – in fact, the Altneuschule used one as well during the 18th Century – had the instrument and they did not repair it when it malfunctioned. Therefore, the Orthodox argued, they must have become aware it constituted an \\"gentile ordinance\\". Since 1819, the organ became a symbol of Reform, and the most obvious demarcation between traditional and non-traditional synagogues in Germany,David Ellenson, A Disputed Precedent: the Prague Organ in Nineteenth- Century Central European Legal Literature and Polemics. Leo Baeck Institute Year Book 40 (1995) pp. 251-264. though it would be sanctioned by mainstream rabbis in Italy and France.Jakob Josef Petuchowski, Organ, Encyclopedia Judaica, 2007. Some forty responsa condemning the New Israelite Temple were received and edited into a single compendium, These are the Words of the Covenant (Ele divrei ha-brit), which was published in Hamburg in May 1819. It was centred on the ruling of the city rabbinic court, stating that in order to \\"seal the breach and erect a fence around the Law\\", to \\"undo a new Law, fabricated by some unlearned individuals who are not scholars\\", three ordinances were decreed: it was forbidden to meddle with the order of prayer, to pray in another language or to employ a musical instrument in the synagogue on Sabbath and festivals, not even by a gentile. The contributors to Words of the Covenant served across Central Europe and Italy: from Naphtali Hirsch Katzenellenbogen of Wintzenheim in the west to Yaakov Lorberbaum of Lissa in the east, from Samuel Bernstein of Amsterdam in the north to Solomon Malah of Leghorn in the south. While all were generally harsh in tone, Rabbi Eleasar Löw of Triesch conceded some of the Reformers' claims, agreeing that the disorder and cacophony in traditional synagogues had to be dealt with. One responsa which was not in included by Sofer came from Ephraim Zalman Margolis of Brody, far in the east. Margolis, in an undisturbed traditional surrounding, debated the matter of Hebrew in prayer in a theoretical, almost detached manner. It arrived too late, and the rabbi of Pressburg found it too inconclusive.Samet, pp. 294-295; Meyer, Response, pp. 57-59. Conclusion Hacham Isaac Bernays, in his clerical vestments. Words of the Covenant did not end the controversy. The New Israelite Temple's congregants continued to attend it, little affected by the massive protest. Bresselau set out to find every precedent and lenient ruling he could muster and compiled About the Prayer of the Israelites in the Vernacular (\\"Ueber die Gebete der Israeliten in der Landessprache\\"), in which he attempted to rebut many of the Orthodox arguments. He also authored a barbed Hebrew satire named A Sword Avenging the Covenant (Herev Nokemet Nakam Brit; Leviticus 26:25), portraying the elderly rabbis as senile and indifferent to religious apathy among the young. Rabbi Löb Reinitz of Moravia countered Bresselau's pamphlet with his Flaming Sword (Genesis 3:24), denouncing the Reformers as heretics. Not only the strictly Orthodox turned against the Israelite Temple: moderate maskil Nachman Berlin of Lissa authored two tracts criticising them severely, and so did Salomon Jacob Cohen, the last editor of HaMeassef. Young Samuel David Luzzatto composed a satire of his own against the Temple. The rabbinic coalition that was established to compose Words of the Covenant did succeed on other fronts. Chorin relapsed in mid-1820, and went to Vienna to assist Liebermann. He published a book named A Timely Word (Davar be-I'to) aimed at convincing the authorities to allow them to build a Hamburg-style synagogue. He lambasted Benet, depicting him as an overbearing tyrant, and protested that his preamble had been removed by Sofer. On 20 January 1820 the Imperial Court accepted Homberg and Beer's petition and decreed that Jews will now only pray in the vernacular. Ha-Levi in Trieste, Benet in Nikolsburg and the rabbinic court of Prague interceded, appealing to the Emperor himself in early 1821. By April, due to concerted effort and ceaseless petitions, The government relented and ameliorate the conditions, requiring only adding a translation to prayerbooks.Dobin, 282-285. They also rejected Liebermann's proposals, forcing him to leave the capital. He was not heard from again. Chorin also returned to his small community in disappointment. He continued to clash with Sofer, who would occasionally force him to recant his views in the following decades.Pelli, pp. 74-76. But the dispute in Hamburg itself was yet to be resolved. After the community was almost torn asunder by polemics, and nearly three years in which the New Temple attracted large crowds, the board of elders finally decided to accept a solution promulgated by Lazarus Jacob Riesser (father of Gabriel Riesser) from the first days of the crisis. They dismissed the three elderly rabbinic judges and hired a permanent new chief rabbi. They chose young Isaac Bernays, one of the first rabbis who also went to university. He was appointed on 30 October 1821. Bernays represented a new generation: while he studied under Rabbi Abraham Bing, he was also thoroughly modern and acculturated. He immediately reformed services in the old synagogue at Neuer Steinweg. Bernays wore clerical vestments, delivered edifying sermons in pure German, had a choir accompany prayers and introduced strict decorum. He forbade spitting on the floor, screaming, stomping, loudly correcting the reader during the cantillation and the like. His conduct drew many of the Temple's congregants back to the old community, practically resolving the conflict.Meyer, pp. 58-61. He was modern in another, more significant aspect; his contract banned him from cursing, punishing or denying charity funds from transgressors. He lacked any jurisdiction in civil affairs from the start. Ismar Schorsch noted that twenty years after the retirement of his predecessor Raphael Cohen, whose authority was undermined by complaints to the government on the part of nonobservant members, Bernays symbolized the transformation of the rabbinate. From an institution entrusted with judging, collecting taxes and enforcing Halakha upon all Jews, their concerns were transferred solely to the religious sphere, created when new realities engendered a secular, neutral one, unregulated by religious law, something which was foreign to traditional Jewish society. Even the title \\"rabbi\\" was denied to him by the community, and he was given the designation of \\"Hacham\\", like his Sephardi equivalents. His contract also specifically forbade him from interfering in the matters of the Temple congregation, whose members paid both their own membership dues and taxes to the community. The two groups coexisted side by side.Ismar Schorch, Emancipation and the Crisis of Religious Authority: The Emergence of the Modern Rabbinate, in: Reinhard Rürup ed., Revolution and Evolution, 1848 in German-Jewish History, Mohr Siebeck, 1981. pp. 207-210. Bernays and his close associate Jacob Ettlinger of Altona are regarded by historians as the founding fathers of \\"Neo-Orthodoxy\\", or Torah im Derech Eretz, the ideology which sought to combine traditional religious attitudes with utter modernization. Their most famous and prominent pupil, Samson Raphael Hirsch, was theologically dogmatic and stressed that even the slightest minutiae of practice originated at the revelation at Mount Sinai. But, as Schorch commented, \\"Like the spokesmen for Reform, Hirsch dropped all demands for judicial autonomy and continuance of Jewish civil law. He insisted upon the wholly religious character of Judaism, reduced the significance of the periods of Jewish national independence, and divested the messianic concept of political overtones. With a rationalism and Hegelianism that he fully shared with the reformers, whom he detested, Hirsch too emphasized the ethical content and universal mission of Judaism.\\"David Ellenson, Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer and the Creation of a Modern Jewish Orthodoxy, University of Alabama Press, 1994. pp. 18-19 (quoted there from the original). Words of the Covenant, and the demonstrable willingness of the Orthodox to exert their influence, deterred the radical elements in Vienna. Eventually, a new synagogue was opened in 1826. Isaac Noah Mannheimer came to serve as supervisor. Mannheimer, who conducted \\"devotion\\" ceremonies as a Jewish school director at Copenhagen and later visited the Beer and Kley temples, developed a decidedly conservative bent. Determined to preserve unity by accommodating the traditionalists, he introduced in the Viennese Stadttempel a decorous, yet carefully crafted rite, that combined music and abridged liturgy but none of which was condemned in Hamburg. Michael L. Miller added: \\"these innovations could all be reconciled with the Code of the Set Table... Mannheimer managed to strike a 'golden mean', without violating Halakha\\". A similarly restrained aestheticization of prayer forms, with no dogmatic implications or breaching of legalistic constraints, was instituted in the new Spanish Synagogue at Prague by the even more conservative Rabbi Michael Sachs. The model presented by these two congregations became popular throughout the Austrian Empire.Meyer, Response, pp. 150-157; Michael L. Miller, Michael Miller, Rabbis and Revolution: The Jews of Moravia in the Age of Emancipation, Stanford University Press, 2010. p. 82. During 1820, the New Israelite Temple established an affiliated prayer group in the Leipzig Trade Fair. Services were held annually, and knowledge of them spread across Europe via the Jewish merchants. Another short-lived association which attempted to emulate the Berlin-Hamburg model was active in Karlsruhe between 1820 and 1823. But although many synagogues gradually began to adopt aesthetic reforms, those were limited and strictly in the external sphere. The prayerbook, especially the ideology behind it, and even the organ on Saturday remained confined to Congregation New House. \\"Here alone during the 1820s and 1830s there had been a clearly nonorthodox Jewish religious service... Everyone agreed that it stood 'isolated',\\" concluded Meyer, \\"a beacon whose light no one seemed eager to welcome.\\"Meyer, Response, 111-115. Second dispute The new Temple at the Poolstraße. In the two decades that followed after the end of the first controversy, the social and cultural processes which led to the establishment of the Israelite Temple ripened and intensified, engulfing most of German Jews. An entire generation went to modern schools; levels of personal observance, which were steadily declining for many years, now reached a critical turning point. In the 1840s, the majority could be classified a non- Orthodox. The last traditional yeshiva, that of Fürth, closed in 1828. Higher education became mandatory for rabbis both by government decree and popular demand. Young university graduates slowly replaced the old religious leadership. Reform tendencies, limited to the upper crust of acculturated laymen twenty years earlier, now permeated the rabbinate itself. Many of its members were steered by the social pressures of a public losing interest in its religion and the intellectual challenge of Judaic studies (Wissenschaft des Judentums), pioneered by Leopold Zunz and his circle. Subjecting tradition to scientific scrutiny, under the influence of liberal Protestant theologians who had done the same, various concepts - like the Resurrection of the Dead, the mentions of Angels in the liturgy and the like - taken for granted were now critically reevaluated, and condemned as alien imports from ancient middle-eastern pagan religions. The most radical partisan of Wissenschaft was the young Rabbi Abraham Geiger, who launched the irreverent journal Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift für Jüdische Theologie, where Judaism was critically analyzed with little concern for received forms or beliefs. By 1837, the liberal wing was sufficiently strong for Geiger to convene a group of like-minded rabbis in Wiesbaden and suggest radical measures to bridge the gap between most of the Jewish public and its religion. On this background, in April 1839, the spiritual leadership of the Hamburg Temple decided to draft a second edition of its prayerbook, indeed the only new Reform liturgy since the former.David Ellenson, Traditional Reactions to Modern Jewish Reform: The Paradigm of German Orthodoxy, in: Daniel H. Frank, Oliver Leaman, ed., History of Jewish Philosophy, Psychology Press, 2003. p 655. Approaching its semi- jubilee, the directorate believed it was high time to break out of the isolation and gain the influence they believed accorded their association.Meyer, Response, p. 116. The commission in charge comprised Gotthold Salomon, Eduard Kley, Bresselau and Fränkel. Kley resigned from the temple, replaced as preacher by Naphtali Frankfurter, and Bresselau died on 25 December. They declared that the new tome must express the \\"pure teaching of our ancestral religion\\", and all that contrasted it \\"must be removed.\\" In comparison to the Wissenschaft-inspired rabbinical cadre the Hamburg commission was still quite dilettante, lacking a well-defined ideological stance, a matter which little concerned them. It also had to accommodate a diverse congregation and maintain its legitimacy within the wider community. \\"Not a few\\" among its constituents, as Meyer commented, were rather conservative, even strictly observant, and had no interest in far-reaching modifications. Their aim was to compose an inspiring liturgy, not a theologically consistent one. The second edition, published in August 1841, introduced few innovations. It both restored several traditional formulae, like the hymnal verses and some petitions for Jerusalem (though in small print and untranslated) and omitted others, producing a rite that altogether was not more radical than the 1818 version. Yet this time, the authors declared they hoped that the prayerbook would be adopted \\"in all communities where the strive for progress reigned alongside a genuine fear of God.\\" In addition, The constituency of the Temple grew, and the old building was overcrowded. In 1840 they requested the Hamburg Senate to be allowed to build a new, 640-seat sanctuary in the Poolstraße. They also wrote the main community, arguing they were due-paying members and asked for it to aid in financing the project. The outreach efforts of the Reform party alerted Bernays into action, in spite of his contract.Meyer, Response, pp. 117-118. On 16 October 1841, the Hacham issued an announcement that the new prayerbook did not fulfill the minimal requirements under religious law, and those who used it were not meeting the obligation of worship. The Temple directorate were quick to counter Bernays. Emulating the Orthodox in 1819, they shortly marshaled twelve responsa from liberal rabbis and preachers that, while not all in favour of the volume, lambasted Bernays for placing a ban and refuting his halakhic arguments. The lettres were published in a collection named Theologische Gutachten iiber das Gebetbuch nach dem Gebrauche des neuen israelitischen Tempelvereins in Hamburg. The issue entangled all shades of the rabbinate in Central Europe, engendering a heated polemic: Abraham Geiger, who wrote a lettre in support of the Hamburg congregation, stressed in his writing that more than the specific issue at hand, he became involved because the controversy surfaced the deepest religious debates of its era. Gotthold Salomon published another tract of his own, where he rebutted most of the rabbi's claims on legal grounds, but acknowledged that the meddling with the Messianic ideal constituted a severe aberration. Rabbi Zecharias Frankel from Dresden, the most prominent of those who occupied the middle position between the Reform and strictly Orthodox, dismissed the ban, demonstrating that the book contained all obligatory prayers. He also declared himself opposed to the tome, for its contents were in contrast to the people's spirit. The belief in a personal Messiah, wrote Frankel, was ancient and hallowed. He ridiculed Bernays both for resorting to such means instead of attempting to convince the public by reasoning, and stressing legalist arguments - which the prayerbook could withstand - when he should have debated the principled matters of faith. Neither did the Rabbi of Dresden base his argument on rigid Orthodox notions, but on the sanctity of collective sentiment, a key idea in his philosophy, which he would later term \\"Positive-Historical Judaism\\", considered by Conservative Judaism as its antecedent. Aside from his condemnation of Bernays' ban, he conducted a similar exchange, also negative, with Salomon, criticising the prayerbook. He opposed the tendency to turn Judaism into a \\"world religion\\", universal and devoid of particularism, arguing for the centrality of the notion that the People Israel shall one day regain its own existence at \\"a small corner of the earth.\\" David Fine noted \\"this was vintage Frankel, arguing for tradition not from the standpoint of halakhic minutiae but from the commanding voice of nation, people, history and custom... it stands as an early example for the burgeoning split between Reformers and the Positive-Historical School\\", which was concluded when Frankel exited the 1845 Frankfurt rabbinical conference and terminated any connection with the other camp.David J. Fine, Abraham Geiger and the Hamburg Gebetbuchstreit of 1842, in: Christian Wiese, ed. Jüdische Existenz in der Moderne: Abraham Geiger und die Wissenschaft des Judentums, Walter de Gruyter, 2013. pp. 163-164. Isaac Noah Mannheimer closely echoed Frankel, with whom he shared much in common (David Ellenson termed Mannheimer \\"Positive-Historical\\") denouncing both Bernays' pamphlet and the prayerbook itself.David Ellenson, Between Tradition and Culture: The Dialectics of Modern Jewish Religion and Identity, Scholars Press, 1994. p. 66.; George Y. Kohler, Der jüdische Messianismus im Zeitalter der Emanzipation, Walter de Gruyter, 2014. pp 20-22. Another one who came to the aid of the Temple was the Samuel Holdheim, who would thereafter distinguish himself as a radical Reform rabbi. Holdheim defended two aspects of the new prayerbook. He cited the conventional halakhic sources for praying in German; on the matter of the sacrificial cult he quoted Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, where sacrifices were described as a primitive form of worship meant to allow the Israelites contact God in a manner still common and acceptable in ancient, barbaric times. Holdheim attempted to grant this philosophical work a higher status than Maimonides' legal rulings that the sacrifices shall be restored.George Y. Kohler, Reading Maimonides' Philosophy in 19th Century Germany, Springer, 2012. pp. 196-197. The most important participant was Geiger, who published a lengthy treatise on the matter, Der Hamburger Tempelstreit, eine Zeitfrage. He clarified from the start that Bernays did not interest him in particular, mocking the \\"medieval\\" form in which he chose to protest. He was also angered by the fact that in his book, Der Biblische Orient, Bernays did present a model of historical progress in the Jewish prayer rite, wondering why the rabbi will not understand that a reformulation was now necessary due to the same process of change with the times. But for Geiger, the subject was his conservative rivals, mainly Frankel, and the authors of the prayerbook. He devoted his book to a history of the development of Jewish prayer, demonstrating how the various layers emerged through the ages. Geiger dismissed any sentimental romanticism accorded to it by the people, arguing that it has always been subject to profound change. On the other hand, he criticised the Hamburg Temple editors for not fully replacing the Messianic concept. While they omitted much, they retained some petitions. He believed they should have adopted the alternative already promulgated in scholarly Reform circles, that of a Messianic age of global harmony. Geiger added they should have also excised all segments referring to beliefs already considered irrational, like the resurrection.Fine, pp. 171-173. Fine emphasized how the 1841-2 debate delineated the positions around which the three different factions would coalesce in the coming decade, the most crucial era in the history of modern Jewish denominations. The main issue was the divine origin and, consequently, immutability of the chain of traditional interpretation and ruling, independent of critical analysis of past circumstances. \\"Geiger could not understand that for Bernays, the study of history did not necessarily dictate contemporary praxis. For him, historical research was permitted, even lauded, but results had no halakhic authority. This is the form that modern Orthodoxy would eventually take under Hildesheimer... The difference between Reform Judaism that stemmed from Geiger and the Positive-Historical (and later, Conservative) Judaism that stemmed from Frankel was whether history commanded for change or conservatism. The lessons of research could be disputed, but both of them believed history to be the source of authority.\\"Fine, p. 168. While the Temple congregation enlisted massive support, Bernays only received aid from Jacob Ettlinger. The polemic subsided, especially after the great fire of 4–8 May 1842, which destroyed Hamburg. The new edifice of the Temple, in the Poolstraße, was dedicated in 1844. The route of the Orthodox effectively demonstrated how strong their rivals became, paving the way for the Reform rabbinical conferences of 1844-6, led by Geiger, which were a key event in the formation of Reform Judaism. In the second one, at Frankfurt – which Frankel left after a day, when it was declared that there was no \\"objective obligation\\" to maintain Hebrew in prayer – the majority voted to officially accept that while the Messianic ideal was important, all notions of a Return to Zion and restoration of the sacrificial cult must be excised.Meyer, Response, pp. 118-119, 136-138.

He did much to develop garden cities in the Paris region. He was Minister of Health in 1936–37. Life Early years Henri Charles Sellier was born on 22 December 1883 in Bourges, Cher. His father was a skilled metalworker who became a foreman in the cannon foundry of the Bourges arsenal. His mother, who came from a prosperous farming family, ran a small watch and jewelry shop. Sellier won a scholarship to the lycée in Bourges. He was a brilliant pupil, and won a state scholarship to study at the École des Hautes Études Commerciales (HEC) business school, where he gained a diploma in 1901. In the summer of 1902 the HEC sent Sellier to work in the Siemens plant in Hamburg as secretary to Walther Rathenau, where he first met Albert Thomas. Sellier was influenced by the socialists Édouard Vaillant and Jules-Louis Breton. He joined the Blanquist Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party in 1898. Due to his left-wing political views he had difficulty finding a permanent job. From 1902 to 1906 he worked in various financial and commercial enterprises while studying in his spare time. In 1906 he graduated with a degree in Law from the Faculty of Paris. That year he joined the Ministry of Labor as a rédacteur, and in a few years became a bureau chief. In 1907 Sellier married Jessa Guitton, a seamstress and then shop worker. They had two children, a boy and a girl. Political career thumb Sellier remained an active socialist and collaborated with Jean Jaurès and Albert Thomas. He voted with the majority to join the Communist Third International at the Tours Congress in November 1920, but in October 1921 was expelled from the French Communist Party and joined the Socialist French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). He remained a member of the SFIO for the rest of his life. In 1909 Sellier was elected to the Puteaux municipal council in the western suburbs of Paris. In 1910 he was elected to represent the canton of Puteaux in the general council of the Seine department, and resigned from the Ministry. He was reelected to the general council in 1912 and 1919. He was elected mayor of Suresnes in 1919, and held office until 1940. His electoral program highlighted improvements to health, housing and urban renewal. In 1925 the canton of Puteaux was divided, and Sellier was elected to represent the 2nd district, Suresnes and Nanterre-Sud, in the general council of the Seine. He was reelected in 1929 and 1935. He was general rapporteur of the budget of the Seine department from 1917 to 1920, and president of the general council in 1927–28. Sellier ran unsuccessfully for election to the senate in January 1927. He was elected senator for the Seine in the first round in the elections of 20 October 1935 on the Popular Front list. He was Minister of Health in the first cabinet of Léon Blum from 4 June 1936 to 21 June 1937. Urban planning \\"collectif\\" housing in the Drancy garden city Sellier was appointed managing director of the Office des Habitations à Bon Marché (Office of Affordable Housing) of the Seine department when it was created in 1915, and dedicated himself to urban issues and public housing. He moved to Suresnes that year, and would do much to improve the municipal facilities. In 1918 Sellier and Marcel Poëte founded the École des hautes études urbaines (EHEU, School of Advanced Urban Studies) and the review La Vie Urbaine. Sellier helped found the Union internationale des villes (International Union of Towns), of which he was vice president from 1920. In 1925 he was one of the founders of the Union amicale des maires de banlieue (Friendly Union of Suburban Mayors). Sellier became a role model for Social-Democratic city leaders in the inter-war period. He aimed for a system in which efficient teams of specialists would regulate urban agglomérations to maximize the welfare and individual potential of the inhabitants. These agglomérations would not necessarily reflect traditional administrative boundaries, but would be natural units for planning purposes. He said, \\"The tentacular city is a fact. Its advantages and disadvantages may be discussed, but it would be stupid to deny it and reckless to hinder its social role. He saw the old administrative structure of Paris and its surrounding communes as an outdated obstacle to healthy evolution of the overall urban area, in which unregulated capitalist expansion would inevitably cause social evils. Sellier proposed a ring of garden cities surrounding Paris. Over the years Selliers views evolved from emphasizing local political responsibility to an approach based more on social sciences and cost effectiveness. Sellier wanted Suresnes to become a city at whose gates \\"the prospective inhabitant ceases to be a worker and becomes once more a man.\\" He became hugely popular as he transformed Suresnes into a model of modernist and rationalist urban planning. As soon as he took office as mayor of Suresnes in 1919 Sellier began to establish a system of social services with a special emphasis on the health of children. One of his first steps was to restructure the colonie de vacances through which children from the city were given vacations of eight or more weeks with country families in the Nièvre. The children would be freed from the collective discipline of the city, \\"one of the major causes of mental exhaustion among children in our great cities.\\" They would gain a living link to the countryside, a sort of adopted birthplace. Sellier organized health protection from infancy, created institutions for education at all ages, built many public facilities and was innovative in providing housing that was comfortable and hygienic. He inspired the creation of fifteen garden cities between 1920 and 1945: Boulogne-Billancourt, Champigny-sur-Marne, Charenton- le-Pont, Châtenay-Malabry, Drancy, Drancy Cité de la Muette, Gennevilliers, Les Lilas, Maisons-Alfort, Le Plessis-Robinson, Le Pré-Saint-Gervais/Pantin, Stains, Vanves and Vitry-sur-Seine. In 1937 Sellier and Poëte founded the Fédération Internationale de l’habitation et de l’urbanisme (International Federation of Housing and Urban Planning). World War II Tomb of Henri Sellier in the Cimetière Carnot in Suresnes During World War II (1939–45) Sellier refrained from voting on the constitutional change that gave full power to Marshal Philippe Pétain. He was removed from office on 22 June 1941 by the Vichy authorities, arrested by the Gestapo and detained in the camp at Compiègne for almost a month. He refused to work with collaborationist socialists and founded a socialist action committee, which became part of the French Resistance. He died at the age of 59 on 24 November 1943 in Suresnes, Seine. A large crowd defied a ban and attended his funeral.

Career  After school, Maywald returned to this hometown in 1931 but soon realized that the city was too small for the career he wanted for himself. He then moved to Paris where he began his career of photo reporting and befriending other modern artists. He chose to live a bohemian lifestyle and photographed various subjects such as artists, dancers, fashion, etc. Maywald photographed the qualities of living in France with his camera. He became an assistant to Harry Meerson who was a Polish photographer and started to learn from Meerson how to make a living from photography. Maywald moved to Switzerland in 1942 and was held captive in camps for foreigners. In the year of 1943 he was allowed to start working again in portrait photography as a self-employed artist. Maywald was very well known for his black and white photography and stunning lighting. When he moved back to Paris in August 1946 he mainly focused on fashion and celebrity photography.

He had a way of photographing his subjects in these various places but the image still focused on the model/clothing. He became Christian Dior’s elite photographer. Maywald photographed the well- known designers creations and his photographs were featured on the cover of several magazines including Vogue and Vanity Fair. Although Maywald was the main photographer for Dior, he also photographed for several other fashion designers at the time. Although photographing fashion, he produced images of celebrities as well. These celebrities ranged from artists to movie stars to athletes. Maywald retired in 1968, and died in 1985 in Paris.  Publications  Maywald, Willy.

The Oseberg tapestry is a fragmentary tapestry, discovered within the Viking Oseberg ship burial in Norway. The tapestry (dated to about 834AD) is in bad condition and was probably a part of the funeral offering in the ship burial. Its decay meant it took several years to extract. The fragments of the tapestry feature a scene containing two black birds hovering over a horse, possibly originally leading a wagon (as a part of a procession of horse-led wagons on the tapestry).

The Sakasa Kebari is usually defined by firstly its reverse hackle and secondly by its simplicity as compared to western style flies. This fly was originally created to be used in the small, high gradient streams in Japan while fishing for native trout and char.Kelleher, Kevin C. M.D & Ishimura, Misako (2011). Tenkara - Radically Simple, Ultralight Fly Fishing. Lyons Press. One of the main differences between Sakasa Kebari style flies and their western counterparts is that while western style flies tend to mimic specific insects in as much detail as can be accomplishedWyatt, Bob (2013). What Trout Want - The Educated Trout and Other Myths. Stackpole. the Sakasa Kebari is more impressionistic, what is often called an attractor fly. Instead of trying to incorporate an insect's details it tends to be more general allowing the target fish to 'connect the dots'. Philosophy The philosophy behind tenkara fishing is in keeping things as simple as possible and this is reflected in the style of the flies most used in tenkara fishing.Dirks, David (2013). Tenkara Fly Fishing: Insights and Strategies. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. The flies tend to be tied with a minimum of material, usually only one feather and thread. This simplicity actually allows the flies to be tied streamside with no tools other than what the typical fly fisherman would carry while on the water although they are most often tied at a tying bench. Construction This fly was originally created and used by sustenance fishermen in Japan,Tenkara Magazine, Volume One, 2014 hence its minimalistic construction. A quick and easy to build fly suited their purposes more so than a fly that required hard to get materials and a major investment in time. The most iconic version of the Sakasa Kebari is tied using nothing more than a hook, thread, and a feather, usually a pheasant feather. The hooks tend to be between sizes 16 through 12, the body being made solely with the thread, and the feather being wound around the front portion of the hook with the barbels angled forward, toward the eye, as opposed to backward the way most western flies are tied. While the Sakasa Kebari tends toward a simplistic tying approach there are many variants that are more complex. Some use a combination of silk, pheasant tail fibers, wire ribbing, and other materials to construct the body. While most are unweighted, bead heads and lead wrapping can be used to apply weight so the fly can be fished deeper than otherwise possible. While the Sakasa Kebari is usually associated with being a wet fly (a fly that is fished beneath the surface) it can also be fished dry (on the surface) simply by modifying technique, applying floatant, or even using a dry fly hackle instead of the standard wet fly hackle. Variants Ishigaki Sakasa Kebari - A Sakasa Kebari tied with nothing more than black thread and a rooster feather. Amano Sakasa Kebari - A Sakasa Kebari tied with thread and a pheasant feather. peacock herl, and a pheasant feather. While Sakasa Kebari all have similar attributes, such as the reverse hackle and a simpler construction than their western counterparts there are many different variations. The sustenance fisherman that used these flies tended to live in remote villages that were somewhat isolated from other fishing villages. They began to construct regional variations of these flies, this had more to do with the available materials and not so much with one variant working better than another. Ishigaki Sakasa Kebari This is the fly used by the Japanese Tenkara master Dr. Hisao Ishigaki. He ties this fly with nothing more than regular sewing thread and a rooster feather. About the only changes he makes to the fly are differing colors of thread and feather. Dr. Ishigaki is a strong proponent of the 'one fly' approach to tenkara fishing Amano Sakasa Kebari This fly is used by another Tenkara master, Katsutoshi Amano. It is very similar to the Ishigaki Sakasa Kebari but uses a pheasant feather instead of a rooster hackle. The pheasant feather is more supple and webbier and gives the fly a different action when in the water. Mr. Amano is one of the longest living practitioners of tenkara in Japan. He ties this fly using no vise, only his hands and using eyeless hooks. Takayama Sakasa Kebari The Takayama Sakasa Kebari, in addition to thread and a pheasant feather, also uses peacock herl for the thorax of the fly. This gives it a bit more iridescence in the water. Peacock herl is a very popular material in both tenkara and western style fly tying. Technique While the Sakasa Kebari tends to be fished dead drifted (allowing the fly to simply drift with the current) like its western counterparts many people fish the fly with a variety of movements, such as pulsating the fly, pausing the fly, and allowing the fly to drift downstream and across the current (much like fishing western style wet flies). Tenkara fishing (where the Sakasa Kebari is most used) tends to have a ‘one fly’ philosophy. Instead of ‘matching the hatch’ the Sakasa Kebari tends to be a more impressionistic fly, it roughly mimics a large variety of insects and not one in particular. With this in mind the fly is not swapped for other flies as often (or ever) as is done in western fly fishing. The focus is on the technique and not the fly. Changing the fly's action and presentation tend to be done instead of changing the fly itself. There are many tenkara fishers that use the same fly all time and simply adapt their approach as needed. Dr. IshigakiLyle, Morgan (2015). Simple Flies: 52 easy-to-tie patterns that catch fish. Stackpole Books. is a prime example, he uses one fly for practically all of his fishing. The Sakasa Kebari was designed for use in Japan's small high gradient mountain streams. These streams did not have an over abundance of insect life so the chances of the fish keying in on specific insects was minimal. As this was the case there was no need to mimic any one type of insect, a more impressionistic fly, one that mimicked an assortment of insects, tended to be more reliable. The reverse hackle would open and close as the fly drifted in the turbulent waters instead of simply closing on itself the way most western style wet flies would in those conditions.

Common side effects include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reactions, rash, decreased appetite and swelling of the limbs (peripheral edema). Avelumab targets the protein programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). It has received orphan drug designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of gastric cancer in January 2017. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it in March 2017 for Merkel-cell carcinoma. an aggressive type of skin cancer. The EMA approved it in September 2017 for the same indication. This is the first FDA-approved treatment for metastatic MCC, a rare, aggressive form of skin cancer. Avelumab was developed by Merck KGaA and Pfizer. Medical uses In March 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to avelumab for the treatment of adults and children twelve years and older with metastatic Merkel-cell carcinoma (MCC).Pfizer, Merck KGaA fourth to market with PD-1/L1 inhibitor In May 2017, the FDA approved avelumab for people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease progressed during or following platinum- containing chemotherapy or within twelve months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy. In May 2019, the FDA approved avelumab in combination with axitinib for the first-line treatment of people with advanced renal cell carcinoma. In June 2020, the FDA approved avelumab for the maintenance treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has not progressed with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy.  Contraindications  No contraindications have been specified.  Side effects  The most common serious adverse reactions to avelumab are immune-mediated adverse reactions (pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, adrenal insufficiency, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and nephritis) and life-threatening infusion reactions. Among the 88 patients enrolled in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, the most common adverse reactions were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, rash, decreased appetite, and peripheral edema. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in more than one patient in the trial were acute kidney injury, anemia, abdominal pain, ileus, asthenia, and cellulitis. The most common serious risks are immune-mediated, where the body’s immune system attacks healthy cells or organs, such as the lungs (pneumonitis), liver (hepatitis), colon (colitis), hormone-producing glands (endocrinopathies) and kidneys (nephritis). In addition, there is a risk of serious infusion-related reactions. Patients who experience severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions should stop using avelumab. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take avelumab because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby.  Interactions  As avelumab is an antibody, no pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs are expected.  Pharmacology   Mechanism of action  Avelumab is a whole monoclonal antibody of isotype IgG1 that binds to the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and therefore inhibits binding to its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). Formation of a PD-1/PD-L1 receptor/ligand complex leads to inhibition of CD8+ T cells, and therefore inhibition of an immune reaction. Immunotherapy aims at ceasing this immune blockage by blocking those receptor ligand pairs. In the case of avelumab, the formation of PD-1/PDL1 ligand pairs is blocked and CD8+ T cell immune response should be increased. PD-1 itself has also been a target for immunotherapy. Therefore, avelumab belongs to the group of immune checkpoint blockade cancer therapies.  History  As of May 2015, according to Merck KGaA and Pfizer, avelumab has been in Phase I clinical trials for bladder cancer, stomach cancer, head and neck cancer, mesothelioma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. For Merkel-cell carcinoma, Phase II has been reached and for NSCLC there is also a study in Phase III. In May 2017, avelumab was approved in the United States for the treatment of adults and children twelve years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), including those who have not received prior chemotherapy. This is the first FDA-approved treatment for metastatic MCC, a rare, aggressive form of skin cancer. Approval was based on data from an open-label, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial (JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial). All patients had histologically confirmed metastatic MCC with disease progression on or after chemotherapy administered for metastatic disease. ORR was assessed by an independent review committee according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The overall response rate (ORR) was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.3, 43.8), with 11% complete and 22% partial response rates. Among the 29 responding patients, the response duration ranged from 2.8 to 23.3+ months with 86% of responses durable for 6 months or longer. Responses were observed in patients regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression or presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus. The approval of avelumab was based on data from a single-arm trial of 88 patients with metastatic MCC who had been previously treated with at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. The trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (overall response rate) and, for patients with a response, the length of time the tumor was controlled (duration of response). Of the 88 patients who received Bavencio in the trial, 33 percent experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors. The response lasted for more than six months in 86 percent of responding patients and more than 12 months in 45 percent of responding patients. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for avelumab priority review, breakthrough therapy, and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted accelerated approval of Bavencio to EMD Serono Inc. In June 2020, avelumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the indication of the maintenance treatment for people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has not progressed with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy. Efficacy of avelumab for maintenance treatment of urothelial carcinoma was investigated in the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial (NCT02603432), a randomized, multi-center, open- label trial that enrolled 700 patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that had not progressed with four to six cycles of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either avelumab intravenously every 2 weeks plus best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone.

He was born in Tehran, Iran on July 2, 1929.International Short Film Festival (accessed 11 December 2015) He signs his books \\"M.F. Farzaneh\\" and his films \\"Feri Farzaneh\\".  Biography  Farzaneh Started to study at the age of 6 in the only boy-and-girl school in Tehran. He went to Tamaddon High school. This particularly cosmopolitan school, nested in the Embassies' District of Tehran, would lead him to befriend numerous Russian, Polish, Check, and Romanian refugees as well as all kinds of Iranians – be it Shiites, Assyrians, Jews and Armenians. The Dean, Mr. Salek, had chosen his Faculty outside the recommendations of the Ministry of Education. For instance, the French teacher had come from France, through Algeria to Tehran amidst WWII. Always looking sharp, that gentleman would only speak French. So much so that for the most part, his students did not know he was actually Iranian! The maths teacher was a chemical engineer and the literature teacher, Javad Fazel, was a renowned serial novelist. He was actually the first one to encourage Farzaneh to start writing, publishing one of his poems in a weekly magazine. While about to graduate from Alborz high school, Philosophy professor S. Goharine, a renowned specialist of Mowlavi, introduced Farzaneh to Sadegh Hedayat. Hedayat encouraged him to read Kafka and Sartre – from which he had personally translated a few books – as well as Joyse, Virginia Woolf, Albert Camus, John Dos Passos. At the age of twenty, Farzaneh decided to write his first novel: Four Aches. In this book, he used the inner monologue in Persian literature. After two years in his law studies, while studying French at the French Institute, he decided to leave Tehran and emigrate to Paris in 1950. He wanted to fulfill both his dream and his mother's. She had indeed religiously kept the souvenirs her father had brought back from his trip there at the Universal Exhibition, back in 1900. Since his father insisted on it, Farzaneh pursued his Law degree, while also enrolling in Ethnology studies, as recommended by Hedayat. They met again in Paris. Unfortunately, Hedayat committed suicide in April 1951. Married with a child, he needed to shorten his studies. He went to Toulouse to get his PhD, benefiting from a special governmental program for foreign students. He then received a scholarship to attend the Institute of Higher Cinematographic Studies (IDHEC). He eventually decided to stay in France and started a career as a film director and producer. He first published La Maison d’Exil in 1990, a dream novel with a desperate tone. Then, three years later, he published Rencontres avec Sadegh Hedayat (Jose Corti). There he painted a particularly living portrait of someone who until then was no more than the author of The Blind Owl. Farzaneh went on and translate a few important works from Hedayat; Madame Alavieh, L’Eau de Jouvence as well as a critical study of Omar Khayam’s verses. Later, the French version of Les Quoters Douleurs (Four Aches) was published in 1996. In the following years, M. F. Farzaneh published other books in Persian, including an autobiography called L'Araignee Loquace (The Talkative Spider) and some short stories, including Les Dents (The Teeth), La Jeune fille et Azrael (The young Girl and Azrael), Le Facteur (The Mailman), Le Destin (Destiny), where fantasy meets black humor and satire.

It was discovered by English astronomer William Herschel on March 14, 1784, who described it as \\"very bright, pretty large, gradually brighter in the middle\\". With an apparent visual magnitude of 10.7, it is located around 60,000 light years away from the Sun at a relatively high galactic latitude of 77.2°. This is a relatively small globular cluster, ranking 112th in luminosity among the Milky Way globular cluster population. It is considered an Oosterhoff type I cluster (OoI), despite having a relatively low metallicity. Indeed, it has the lowest metallicity of any OoI cluster known. There are 19 RR Lyrae variable star candidates and as many as 23 blue stragglers. A high proportion of the latter are concentrated near the dense core of the cluster, which is consistent with the idea that blue stragglers form through stellar mergers. The cluster lies some from the Galactic Center, and is relatively isolated from other globular clusters in the galaxy. The position of this cluster makes it a candidate for association with the Sagittarius tidal stream, and thus it may have been captured by the Milky Way after separation from the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. A contour map of the cluster appears to show S-shaped tidal arms stretching to the north and south for several tidal radii. Such features are predicted for globular clusters that follow elliptical orbits and are near their apogalacticon.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was included as a contributing property in the West Jefferson Street Historic District in 1991 and in the Downtown Commercial Historic District in 2015. The brick commercial building was constructed in 1880 in the Late Victorian Gothic Revival style. It is a three-story structure with a limestone facade on Jefferson Street, brick along Fourth Street, and a chamfered corner that joins the two elevations. The Jefferson street facade is livelier with short towers, pilasters between the widows, and Gothic arched hoods over tall, narrow windows. The Fourth Street facade is flatter, with wider windows and stone used for the keystones, hood molds, imposts, window sills, small columns and belt courses. with The building was built as an investment by local businessmen Thomas Hedge, Sr., E.H. Carpenter, John M. Gregg, and Wesley Bonar. They hired Burlington architect Charles A. Dunham to design the building. Three of the men who built the building owned one of three frontages and one owned the corner frontage. A variety of businesses occupied the building over the years, with the Orchard City Business College, later called Elliott's Business College, occupying the second and third floors of the corner section for a time.

Oodua Peoples Congress was formed in 1994 as a socio-cultural group to promote Yoruba people and culture. Although Gani was not a founding member of OPC, he was appointed the National Coordinator of the Oodua Peoples Congress, Gani rose to nationwide popularity after Inspector General of Police Musiliu Smith declared him wanted in 2000 with a financial reward of N100,000 for his group's involvement in violent clashes. He was however arrested on 22 August 2001 but was later released after being held in prisons in Lagos, Abeokuta and Abuja. On October 14, 2017, Adams was declared to be the 15th Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland by Oba Adeyemi III, the Alaafin of Oyo. The chieftaincy was last held by Moshood Abiola before his death in 1998.

This captured can either be stored underground in what is known as carbon capture and storage, or converted into carbon-neutral fuel using renewable energy sources, by a process the company calls Air to fuels. The company is running a pilot plant in Squamish, British Columbia, removing CO2 from the atmosphere since 2015 and converting it into fuels since December, 2017. The company was founded in 2009 by David Keith, now a Board Member as well as a professor of public policy and applied physics at Harvard University, and is now led by Steve Oldham, former Senior Vice President of Strategic Business Development at MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates. Carbon Engineering is funded by several government and sustainability-focused agencies as well as by private investors, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and oil sands financier N. Murray Edwards. In addition, in 2019 the company received 68 million USD from private investors, including fossil fuel companies Chevron, Occidental, and BHP.  Technology  Carbon Engineering's DAC system integrates two main cycles. The first cycle is the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere in a device called an \\"air contactor\\" using an alkaline hydroxide solution. The second cycle regenerates the capture liquid used in the air contactor, and delivers pure CO2 as an end product. These cycles operate in tandem continuously, producing a concentrated stream of CO2 gas as an output, and requiring only energy, water, and small material make up streams as inputs. Energy is used in such a way that no new CO2 emissions are incurred, and thus do not counteract what was captured from the air.The captured atmospheric CO2 can be stored underground, used for enhanced oil recovery, or turned into low-carbon synthetic fuels using the company's AIR TO FUELS™ technology. Carbon Engineering's Air to fuel process can produce fuels such as gasoline, diesel, or jet A using inputs of atmospheric CO2, water, and renewable electricity such as that from solar PV. Electricity is used to split water and manufacture hydrogen, which is then combined with captured atmospheric CO2 to form fuels. This approach offers a means to deliver clean fuels that are compatible with existing engines, and can help de-carbonize the transportation sector by displacing fuels made from crude oil. Pilot plant demonstration In 2015, Carbon Engineering started operations of its full end-to-end pilot plant, located in Squamish, British Columbia, Canada. When running, this facility captures roughly 1 ton of atmospheric CO2 per day. In 2017, the company incorporated fuel synthesis capability into the DAC pilot plant and converted CO2 into fuel for the first time in December 2017. Based on the data obtained from the pilot plant, David Keith and Carbon Engineering published a manuscript on June 7, 2018 that presents a simulation suggesting that CO2 can be captured from the atmosphere at a cost of 94 to 233 USD per ton, \\"[d]epending on financial assumptions, energy costs, and the specific choice of inputs and outputs.\\" The manuscript, titled \\"A process for capturing CO₂ from the atmosphere,\\" was published in the journal Joule. Both DAC and Air to fuel technologies have been proven at the pilot plant and are now being scaled up into commercial markets. Individual DAC facilities can be built to capture 1 million tons of CO2 per year. At that scale, one Carbon Engineering air capture plant could negate the emissions from ~250,000 cars—either by sequestering the CO2 or by using the recycled carbon dioxide as a feedstock to produce synthetic fuel. Over 9,500 of Carbon Engineering's air capture plants would be needed to offset the annual CO2 emissions from the estimated 2 billion vehicles by 2035, which includes medium and heavy trucks that emit significantly more greenhouse gases than passenger vehicles. More still would be needed once aviation, mining, agriculture, construction and non-vehicle emissions are factored in.  Commercialization  In May 2019, Carbon Engineering announced it was partnering with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, LLC. (OLCV), a subsidiary of Occidental, to design and engineer a large-scale Direct Air Capture plant capable of capturing 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year, which would be used in OLCV’s enhanced oil recovery operations and subsequently stored underground permanently. Construction for the plant is expected to begin in 2021, with the plant becoming operational within approximately two years, and it will be located in the Permian Basin. In September 2019, Carbon Engineering announced they were expanding the capacity of the design of the plant from 500,000 metric tons to an expected one million metric tons of CO2 captured per year.

Shidler is the managing partner of The Shidler Group, a national real estate investment organization and is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Shidler Family Foundation. Biography Born in Pasadena, California, Jay H. Shidler, the son of a career U.S. Army officer and a homemaker, grew up on numerous military bases around the world. Shidler attended the University of Hawai‘i and graduated in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in business administration. After graduating from the University of Hawai‘i, Shidler was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Returning to Hawaii in 1971 as a First Lieutenant, Jay Shidler formed the real estate investment firm The Shidler Group. Since forming The Shidler Group in 1971, Shidler has acquired and owned more than 2,000 commercial properties in 40 U.S. states and Canada. He founded and was the initial investor in over 30 public and private companies issuing in excess of $8.5 billion of debt and equity securities. Shidler was co-founder and the initial Chairman of TriNet Corporate Realty Trust (TriNet), which he took public and listed on the NYSE (NYSE: TRI). TriNet was one of the real estate industry's first publicly traded REITs focused exclusively on net leased commercial properties. Headquartered in San Francisco, TriNet became the largest publicly-traded company specializing in sale/leaseback transactions. In 1999, TriNet merged with iStar Financial, Inc., now iStar Inc. (NYSE: STAR). Shidler was co-founder and the initial Chairman of First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. (First Industrial), which he took public and listed on the NYSE (NYSE: FR). Headquartered in Chicago, First Industrial was one of the industry's first publicly-traded REITs to focus exclusively on industrial property. Shidler was co-founder and the initial Chairman of Corporate Office Properties Trust (Corporate Office), which he took public and listed on the NYSE (NYSE: OFC). Headquartered in Columbia, Maryland, Corporate Office Properties was one of the first REITs to focus on serving the specialized requirements of United States Government agencies and defense contractors. Shidler is currently one of the nation's most active buyers of net leased corporate facilities and land underlying existing office buildings and hotels, which are subject to long-term ground leases. Shidler, one of the wealthiest people in Hawaii, is a major collector of abstract expression art and is a trustee of the Honolulu Museum of Art. Shidler has been a Hawaii resident since 1964 and has been married to Wallette (Amoy) Shidler since 1970. Philanthropy and The Shidler Family Foundation Shidler and The Shidler Family Foundation continue to support numerous cultural and educational institutions. Shidler has made significant donations to the University of Washington School of Medicine, the University of Washington School of Law, and the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa. Over the past decade, Shidler's transformational gifts to the Shidler College of Business at the University of Hawai‘i has helped the College become one of the top ranked business schools in the nation. Naming Gift (2006) In 2006, Shidler donated $31 million to the College of Business at the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa in Honolulu. The college, renamed the Shidler College of Business, used the gift to increase student scholarships and faculty research support, expand academic programs, provide matching gift opportunities, and renovate and upgrade classrooms, buildings and the surrounding environment. Visionary Gift (2014-2015) In 2014, Shidler gave an additional $69 million commitment to the Shidler College of Business, growing his total gift to $100 million. The gifts included cash and interests in the land (leased fee interests) underlying U.S. office buildings and hotels. The initial land gifts included the leased fee interests in the land under office buildings in the CBDs of Chicago, Illinois; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Colorado; Columbus, Ohio; and Nashville, Tennessee. During 2015, the land gifts expanded to include leased fee interests in the land underlying 19 Marriott and Hilton hotels including the Marriott Fairfield Inn & Suites Midtown Penn Station in New York City as well as hotels in Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Raleigh, and Orlando. As he was fulfilling his $69 million commitment, Shidler gave an additional $11 million, bringing the total gift to the College to $111 million. Innovation Gift (2017) In October 2017, Shidler donated an additional $117 million, in cash and real estate ground leases, increasing his total gift to $228 million. Shidler's $228 million gift is the largest individual donation in the 110-year history of the University of Hawai‘i, and makes him the second largest known donor to any public business school nationwide. Income from ground lease payments will provide steady and increasing revenue to the College. Over the life of the 99-year ground leases, contractual income to the Shidler College of Business will average $21 million a year and total $2.1 billion. That income stream will be used to fund renovations and new programs, and will materially increase the number of available scholarships. After each ground lease expires, the ownership of each office building and hotel will revert to the College. At that time, it is estimated that the College's stake in this portfolio will be worth in excess of $5.1 billion. Accolades On the 100th anniversary of its formation AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) named Shidler one of the world's 100 most influential leaders in making an impact on business education. Other individuals honored included Mohamed Alabbar, Chairman Emaar Properties; Gary P.

MIGS comprises a group of surgical procedures which share common features. MIGS procedures involve a minimally invasive approach, often with small cuts or micro- incisions through the cornea that causes the least amount of trauma to surrounding scleral and conjunctival tissues. The techniques minimize tissue scarring, allowing for the possibility of traditional glaucoma procedures such as trabeculectomy or glaucoma valve implantation (also known as glaucoma drainage device) to be performed in the future if needed.Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgeries (MIGS) Traditional glaucoma surgery generally involves an external (ab externo) approach through the conjunctiva and sclera; however, MIGS procedures reach their surgical target from an internal (ab interno) route, typically through a self-sealing corneal incision. By performing the procedure from an internal approach, MIGS procedures often reduce discomfort and lead to more rapid recovery periods. While MIGS procedures offer fewer side effects, the procedures tend to result in less intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering than with trabeculectomy or glaucoma tube shunt implantation.  Medical uses  Glaucoma is a group of eye disorders in which there is a chronic and progressive damage of the optic nerve. Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main and only modifiable risk factor, attributed to the progression of the disease. During the last 25 years, glaucoma management has been based in the use of pharmaceutical therapies and incisional surgery. MIGS procedures can provide the patient sustained IOP reduction while minimizing the risk and complications associated with glaucoma interventions and decrease the dependence of glaucoma medications.  Adverse events  MIGS procedures offer an excellent safety profile, with minimal incidence of complications, especially when compared with other forms of glaucoma surgery.  Procedures  MIGS objective, like all glaucoma surgeries, is to achieve lowering of IOP by either increasing aqueous humour outflow, the fluid that is produced by the eye and fills the space between the cornea and the lens, or decreasing the production of aqueous humour. MIGS can be divided in procedures that lower IOP by using micro-stents and minimally invasive procedures.  Micro-stent/shunt devices   iStent  The iStent Trabecular Micro-Bypass Stent, or simply iStent, is the smallest implantable medical device, designed to lower intraocular pressure by facilitating trabecular outflow of aqueous fluid. The trabecular outflow is one of the major outflow pathways for aqueous humor in the eye and has been the target of both pharmaceutical and surgical therapeutic approaches in glaucoma. The 1-millimeter long iStent is a titanium device inserted via an internal approach through the trabecular meshwork into Schlemm’s Canal, bypassing the trabecular meshwork and facilitating flow of aqueous from the eye. Studies have shown that the iStent is an effective procedure, typically lowering intraocular pressure to the mid-teens. The iStent is the first MIGS device to get FDA approval for implantation in combination with cataract surgery. The device has also been shown to offer better IOP control than cataract surgery alone up to one year of follow-up in a large randomized controlled FDA study, although the effectiveness was significantly reduced by 2 years. Safety of the iStent was comparable to cataract surgery alone which is much better than conventional trabeculectomy. Common complications include failure to implant the device, touching the iris with the device, and touching the undersurface of the cornea (endothelium) with the device. Multiple studies have since confirmed the MIGS-type efficacy and safety profile of the iStent. To address the reduced effectiveness at 2 years, some studies have been performed with multiple iStents. A 2019 Cochrane Review found that individuals who receive iStents in combination with cataract surgery may be less likely than those who only receive cataract surgery to need glaucoma eye drops at medium-term follow-up; however, the evidence for this finding was of low quality.  CyPass micro-stent  The CyPass Micro-Stent is the first MIGS device developed for lowering of IOP through the suprachoroidal space (virtual space between the choroid and sclera created by implantation of the device), a part of the uveoscleral outflow pathway for aqueous humor. The uveoscleral pathway is an important pathway for aqueous outflow and drainage which can account for up to 57% of total outflow. Cyclodialysis cleft procedures were initially used to access this pathway with significant IOP lowering, but the cleft was prone to high anatomic variability as well as early postoperative closure due to the lack of a permanent drainage implant with a standardized and uniform conduit. It has a microlumen of 300 microns and is designed to augment outflow to the suprachoroidal space in order to control intraocular pressure; it is indicated for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma. The stent is implanted through an ab interno approach and inserted into the supraciliary space (between the ciliary body and sclera), effectively creating a controlled cyclodialysis cleft, which is kept open by the device. The first clinical data on the device was presented in 2010 showed sustained IOP lowering and MIGS-like safety profile. This has been substantiated in subsequent studies in the combined setting with cataract surgery and as a stand-alone treatment for patients failing glaucoma topical therapy. Data from a large randomized controlled pivotal study (The COMPASS Clinical Study) has reported positive efficacy after 2 years of follow-up and will be submitted to FDA for approval. The CyPass device has been CE-marked since 2009.  Hydrus  The Hydrus Microstent is an implantable MIGS device for the treatment of primary open angle glaucoma; implantation of this device can be performed in conjunction with cataract surgery. The Hydrus Microstent is the longest of the MIGS devices (8-millimeter long implant), and similar to the iStent it is designed to increase trabecular outflow. The implant is inserted through the trabecular meshwork, thus bypassing resistance of aqueous flow through the tissue. However, other glaucoma surgeries, such as canaloplasty, have shown that mechanical dilation of Schlemm’s Canal is also associated with a reduction in intraocular pressure. The Hydrus Microstent takes advantage of this property by mechanically dilating and holding open Schlemm’s Canal. The length of the Hydrus Microstent is thought to open approximately one quarter of Schlemm’s Canal, routing aqueous into open downstream collector channels. Clinical data from a randomized controlled study demonstrates efficacy of the device at 1 and 2 years. The Hydrus Microstent is currently being investigated in an FDA approved study for mild- to-moderate glaucoma.  XEN gel stent  The XEN Gel Stent is an implantable transcleral microsurgical device that allows the aqueous fluid to drain from the anterior chamber into the subconjunctival space, a pathway utilized by traditional trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage device surgeries. Unlike the latter two procedures, the XEN Gel Stent is performed through an internal approach and avoids directly incising and disrupting the conjunctiva itself. The 6-millimeter stent is placed through the trabecular meshwork, with one end of the stent sitting directly underneath the conjunctiva, past the outer wall of the sclera. The inner tip of the stent sits in the anterior chamber, allowing a direct connection for aqueous to flow into the subconjunctival space. The stent is made of a non-bioreactive material, which does not promote scarring of the conjunctiva. The XEN Gel Stent was FDA approved on Nov 22, 2016.  InnFocus Microshunt  The InnFocus Microshunt is a small tube, 8 mm in length, that is inserted in to the eye to help lower intraocular pressure and reduce the need for medications. A Cochrane Review published in December 2019 did not find any published clinical trials to assess whether the InnFocus Microshunt is safer and more comfortable for patients than standard glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy).  Minimally invasive procedures   Endocyclophotocoagulation  Aqueous humor is produced in the portion of the eye known as the ciliary body. The ciliary body contains 72 protrusions known as ciliary processes, from which the aqueous is produced. The destruction of these ciliary processes with a diode laser, known as cyclophotocoagulation, can be used to decrease the amount of aqueous humor produced, thereby reducing the intraocular pressure. Cyclophotocoagulation traditionally has been performed using an external laser through the sclera, known as transcleral cyclophotocoagulation. However, side effects of the transcleral approach can include significant inflammation, chronically low intraocular pressure, intraocular bleeding, and permanent shutdown of the eye, known as phthisis. Recent advances have now allowed a diode laser to be combined with a camera (endoscope) allowing for direct visualization of the ciliary processes during the ablation (Endo Optiks, Beaver Visitec, Waltham, MA). Endocyclophotocoagulation is indicated for the treatment of both open and closed angle glaucoma and is performed in eyes which have already undergone cataract surgery or performed concomitantly with cataract removal. The largest investigation of endocyclophotocoaguation has shown a significant decrease in intraocular pressure of up to 10 mmHg, as well as a significant reduction in number of glaucoma medications needed. Reported adverse reactions include intraocular inflammation, bleeding, and cystoid macular edema (swelling of the retina). A Cochrane Review published in 2019 found no relevant published studies on endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation to assess its effectiveness compared to other surgical treatments (including other MIGS), laser treatment or medical treatment.  Trabectome  The Trabectome, or trabeculectomy ab interno, is a microsurgical device cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since 2006, used in patients with open angle glaucoma to excise a strip of trabecular meshwork, the tissue primarily responsible for the increased resistance of aqueous outflow in glaucoma. The Trabectome uses electrocautery via an internal approach to vaporize the trabecular meshwork, creating a large pathway for aqueous to flow, with minimal trauma to surrounding tissues. The procedure can be performed alone or in conjunction with cataract surgery. Trabectome is unique among the MIGS procedures, as there is no physical device implanted inside the eye; the pressure lowering is a direct result from the destruction and removal of the trabecular meshwork. Studies have found a decrease in intraocular pressure to the mid-teens following the procedure, which has a favorable safety profile. The most common complication from Trabectome surgery is bleeding, which can blur vision and take extra time to recover. The surgery site can scar over time and the pressure can go back up. In early 2014, the NeoMedix received a warning letter from FDA regarding marketing practices.

Its headquarters, which include a conference center, are located in San Bernardino; the Center also operates a branch office in Riverside. The Center is part of a statewide network of regional centers established by the state of California to provide these services under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Act. History IRC was incorporated in 1971 and opened in February 1972 as the thirteenth of what became 21 such California centers established by the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Act and contracted by the California Department of Developmental Services. IRC also operated the San Gabriel-Pomona Regional Center from July 1985 to June 1986. In 1990, services for Inyo and Mono counties were switched from Inland Regional Center to Kern Regional Center in Bakersfield. In 1996, the Center opened its current headquarters in San Bernardino. In 2010, the California Bureau of State Audits found Inland Regional Center had a \\"culture of employee intimidation\\" and concluded the center had violated part of its contract with the state. The audit raised questions about how it sets provider rates, handles property and manages its housing program. The state of California placed the agency on probation in January 2011 and ordered improvements. The auditors found the work environment fostered fear of retaliation for speaking out. Changes were made to policies, and communication measures increased, but some employees said that the work environment actually became worse. Lake Elsinore state Assemblyman Kevin Jeffries unsuccessfully introduced legislation to split the agency and increase transparency. In 2012, the organization received $247 million from the Department of Developmental Services for delivering services. A rail station next to the Center was planned to open in 2020 as part of the Arrow commuter rail project. However, , the station location is no longer planned to be adjacent to the Center due to heightened security after the 2015 shooting. Terrorist attack On December 2, 2015, husband and wife Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik perpetrated a terrorist attack at the Center, which consisted of a mass shooting and an attempted bombing and resulted in 14dead and 22injured. The shooters targeted an event for employees of the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, held in an auditorium with about 80 people. The County had rented the conference center portion of the three building complex. The shooters fled in an SUV. The perpetrators were killed by police after gunfire was exchanged with the occupants of the SUV. Farook, who worked for the public health department as an environmental health inspector, had earlier attended the event.(December 3, 2015).

The previous ARAACOM was created in 1950 and was redesignated ARADCOM in 1957. It was formed to command the Army units allocated to the air defense of the Continental United States. ARAACOM was also charged with becoming the Army component of a joint continental defense force, if and when the joint force was designated. Army Anti-Aircraft Command (ARAACOM) was created on 29 June 1950. Eastern and Western Army Antiaircraft Commands were established with HQ at Stewart AFB, New York, and Hamilton AFB, California, on 1 September 1950. Anti-Aircraft Command moved to Mitchel Air Force Base, New York on 1 November 1950. On 10 April 1951, the Commanding General assumed command of all AAA units allocated to continental air defense—six AW, nine 90 mm gun and eight 120 mm gun battalions plus four brigade and seven group headquarters, eight AAA Ops Dets and 15 Signal Corps radar detachments. On 24 April Central Army Anti-Aircraft Command (CARAACOM) was established with HQ at Kansas City, Missouri. It was organized 1 May 1951. By 31 December controlling formations had grown to six brigade and 13 group headquarters. On 31 May 1955 Eastern ARAACOM was disestablished and personnel assigned to the 1st AAA Region.Volume 1, 232 In 1955, numbering started to replace geographic locations to designate regions.Vigilant and Invincible The 1st, 2nd and 5th Regions (plus the 53rd Artillery Brigade) now covered the area once called Eastern ARAACOM. In 1956, Western ARAACOM became 6th Region, and the following year, Central became the 4th Region. Areas of responsibility between regions and brigades continued to shift throughout the life of the command. On March 21, 1957, ARAACOM was renamed to U.S. Army Air Defense Command (USARADCOM). On 26 July 1960, ARADCOM activated a sixth region. By 1966 the ARADCOM regions and headquarters were as follows: *1st Region - Fort Totten, New York. Moved to Stewart AFB, NY around 1966. The 17th Artillery Group defended Baltimore, Maryland, from 1952. The 56th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, at Fort Totten and then Fort Devens, Massachusetts, controlled the Providence and Boston air defense battalions, a total of five. The 11th Artillery Group, activated in May 1955 at Camp Stewart, GA., controlled the Savannah River Defense Area from its arrival in May 1958. The Defense Area included the 33rd, 425th, and 478th AAA Battalions, though the 478th was deactivated 15 Feb 1958, and the other two battalions appear to have possibly fused into 4th Battalion, 7th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, on 1 September 1958.Morgan and Berhow, 160. The 11th Artillery Group was deactivated August 1960, seemingly at Rehoboth, Massachusetts. 31st Artillery Brigade (Air Defense) served as part of the region while at Lockport AFS, NY. *2d Region - Richards-Gebaur AFB, Missouri. The 2nd ARADCOM Region was activated on 1 March 1951 at Fort George G. Meade, MD, and inactivated on 30 June 1971.Rings of Supersonic Steel, 173. At Oklahoma City Air Force Station, 9/63, Richards-Gebaur AFB (12/69), and then Selfridge Air Force Base. 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade controlled the Washington DC defenses from Fort Meade until it was deactivated in December 1973. Thereafter the 23rd Air Defense Artillery Group stood watch from Meade until 1 September 1974. The Group had previously been part of the New York defenses, and before that, a field artillery group in Long Binh, South Vietnam.Morgan and Berhow, 173. *5th Region - Fort Sheridan, Illinois. Project Nike Integrated Fire Control Site C-80 of the 45th Antiaircraft Brigade opened at Arlington Field in 1955. The brigade was active in the region, later becoming 45th Artillery Brigade (Air Defense), for many years. The 45th Artillery Brigade controlled the Chicago- Gary Defense Area (10 missile batteries and their Integrated Fire Control sites) from the Arlington Heights Army Air Defense Site.Chicago-Milwaukee radar ring, from \\"Rings of Supersonic Steel\\" 5th Region moved to Maxwell AFB, AL, early 1966. 5th Battalion, 562nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment maintained the Barksdale Defense Area until 1966. *6th Region - Fort Baker, California. Activated as WARAACOM in September 1950. To Fort Baker in 1951, according to Rings of Supersonic Steel (p. 153). Disestablished 1 August 1974. 29th Artillery Group (Air Defense) was active around the Travis AFB Defense Area, supervising the Nike-equipped 1st Battalion, 61st Air Defense Artillery Regiment and other units. The 40th Artillery Brigade (AD) was established on 23 January 1959 at Fort Barry, moved to Fort Winfield Scott, and deactivated 23 January 1971. The 114th Artillery Brigade (AD) (CA ARNG) was active between 1959 and 1963, along with the 233rd Artillery Group, both in San Francisco. The 13th Artillery Group, which replaced the 40th Brigade in the Bay Area, was activated in March 1958 at Fort Stewart, GA., deployed to southwest Miami, moved to Homestead AFB in November 1968, Snelling Air Force Station (June 1971), and then the Presidio of San Francisco, where it appears to have deactivated on 1 August 1974.Morgan and Berhow, p. 153. *7th Region - McChord Air Force Base, Washington (July 1960 to 1 April 1966). 31st Air Defense Artillery Brigade, at McChord AFB, transferred to Lockport Air Force Station, NY, in December 1961. Also present were HQ 26th Artillery Group (AD) (12/61-3/66) at Fort Lawton which replaced the 31st Brigade when it moved, and HQ 49th ADA Group (3/66-8/74). With the 7th ARADCOM Region being disbanded on 1 April 1966, the areas of responsibility of the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th ARADCOM Regions were reorganized.Barry Leonard (ed.), History of Strategic and Ballistic Missile Defense: Volume II: 1956-1972, 317 The 115th Artillery Brigade (Air Defense) was a corresponding Washington Army National Guard formation. The NORAD-CONAD History for the first part of 1965 says that the 53d Brigade Headquarters was to move from Maxwell AFB to McChord AFB and the personnel of the discontinued 7th Region transferred to it. The personnel of the 53rd at Maxwell AFB were to be transferred to the 5th Region. The 1st Region Headquarters was also moving from Fort Totten, NY, to Stewart AFB, NY, because Fort Totten was being closed (this may have been in 1974). On 1 August 1966, Lieutenant General Robert Hackett assumed command of the United States Army Air Defense Command at Ent Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, an assignment he held until he retired 30 June 1968. In 1957 the Combat Arms Regimental System organized the battalions under regiments again. In 1968 the Air Defense Artillery Branch was created. ARADCOM strength peaked in 1963, with 184 firing units (134 Regular Army, 50 National Guard). However, beginning in September 1968, the command was reduced in strength. On February 4, 1974, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that ARADCOM would be inactivated, apart from the 31st Air Defense Artillery Brigade, which had been activated during the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962) and would remain on duty in southern Florida. By December 31, 1974, ARADCOM's remaining regional headquarters, eight groups, 13 battalion headquarters, and 48 Hercules firing batteries were closed out. ARADCOM headquarters was inactivated January 4, 1975.

Priscilla Chan has said that her background as a child of immigrant refugees and experience as a teacher and pediatrician for vulnerable children influences how she approaches the philanthropy's work in science, education, immigration reform, housing, criminal justice, and other local issues. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's main areas of work include Science, Education, and Justice and Opportunity, which focuses on promoting housing affordability, criminal justice reform, and immigration reform. The mission of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is to \\"build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone\\" and to \\"advance human potential and promote equality in areas such as health, education, scientific research and energy\\".Devon Maloney, \\"Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg's 99% pledge is born with strings attached\\", The Guardian, Wednesday 2 December 2015 (page visited on 3 December 2015). In 2017, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative pre- leased a 102,079 square foot portion of the new Broadway Station development in downtown Redwood City, CA where it is headquartered.  Activities  Housing and Economic Opportunity  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, in partnership with The San Francisco Foundation and other philanthropic, business, and health organizations, created the Partnership for the Bay's Future in 2019 to \\"preserve, produce, and protect affordable housing\\". The Partnership includes a $500+ million fund for subsidized affordable housing units in the Bay Area, as well as grants for local governments and community organizations to work together to pass local housing legislation that protects tenants and promotes affordability. On October 1, 2018, The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announced it was helping to launch Opportunity Insights, a new non- partisan, not-for-profit research and policy institute focused on improving economic opportunity led by Raj Chetty, John Friedman, and Nathaniel Hendren, leading economists from Harvard University and Brown University. The research aims to \\"better understand the drivers of poverty as well as solutions that can foster greater economic mobility and security for more families.\\" Education  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has funded a number of small- scale, grassroots initiatives to better understand the \\"physical, mental, social and emotional health and development of students as a way to improve academic success,\\" as well as new efforts to make Native American or Black culture more embedded in students' curriculums. Chan noted that \\"We have to be really thoughtful about how we can be helpful and build a collective community alongside others and behind practitioners and school leaders\\" and that educational initiatives must be responsive to local needs because \\"there is not one thing that's going to solve everything.\\" The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative invested $24 million in Andela, a startup focused on training software developers in Africa through a bootcamp and four-year fellowship program which pairs their trainees with U.S. companies needing development help.

The funding has been raised to fuel their international expansion. On March 6, 2018 the Harvard Gazette published that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative would pledge $30 million to the Reach Every Reader project. Both Harvard's President Drew Faust and MIT's President L. Rafael Reif were quoted in the article, as was Priscilla Chan, HGSE Dean James E. Ryan, and MIT's Sanjay Sarma, VP for Open Learning at MIT, and others. The article states: \\"To make significant progress in early literacy at scale, the team will engage in a rigorous, scientific approach to personalized diagnosis and intervention. They will develop and test a scalable, web-based screening tool for reading difficulties that diagnoses the underlying causes, and a set of targeted home/school interventions that change the way we approach intervention for young children with reading difficulties.\\" The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is supporting the development of a civic tech talent pipeline by funding Coding it Forward. The Initiative has funded a free online learning platform, Summit Learning, that is based on a personalized learning philosophy. The use of the platform in some schools have led to concerns about efficacy and student privacy.  Scientific research  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has invested heavily in coronavirus research and response following the global pandemic outbreak in 2020. The organization has contributed multiple grants to various universities and partnerships studying how the coronavirus spreads and possible treatments or vaccines. The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub partnered with Stanford and UCSF to help to significantly increase free testing in the Bay Area starting in March 2020. The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub also announced in July 2020 that it would partner with all 58 California county departments of public health to provide free genomic sequencing of positive coronavirus samples to better understand how the virus is spreading and inform policy decisions. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's first acquisition took place in January 2017 with the acquisition of Meta Inc., a Toronto-based artificial intelligence scientific literature search engine that helps scientists collaborate on solutions and accelerates the dissemination of new scientific research. On September 2016, CZI announced its new science program, Chan Zuckerberg Science, with $3 billion in investment over the next decade, with Cornelia Bargmann of Rockefeller University announced as the first president of science, to begin October 1, 2016. The goal of the program is to help cure, manage, or prevent all disease by the year 2100. $600 million of the $3 billion would be spent on Biohub, a location in San Francisco's Mission Bay District near the University of California, San Francisco, to allow for easy interaction and collaboration between scientists at University of California, San Francisco; University of California, Berkeley; Stanford University; and other universities in the area, as well as engineers and others. Commentators saw the move as audacious but a worthwhile goal, while noting that the amount of funding is small relative to overall money spent on biomedical research. This funding is equal to roughly 2% of the NIH budget earmarked for basic research over the same time frame. Any patents generated at Biohub would be jointly owned by Biohub and the discoverer's home institution.  Politics  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has supported the campaign for California Proposition 15, which adjusts the original Proposition 13, for the 2020 general election. This measure would raise corporate property taxes by requiring large commercial and industrial properties statewide to be assessed for taxation purposes at market rate. This would raise 6.5-11.5 billion dollars annually in additional funding to be directed to public schools (40%) and local governments (60%). Mark Zuckerberg serves as the CEO, chairman, and controlling shareholder of Facebook, Inc., which is primarily based in California. In addition, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is opposing 2020 California Proposition 20, a measure which would lead to stricter sentencing and parole laws.  Company form and taxation  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is not a charitable trust or a private foundation but a limited liability company, and is therefore not a tax-exempt organization as many philanthropies are. As an LLC, the organization has more flexibility in how it addresses its goals, and can invest in for-profit startup companies, can spend money on advocacy initiatives and lobbying, can make political donations, does not have to disclose its pay to its top five executives and has fewer other transparency requirements compared to a charitable trust.Jesse Eisinger, \\"How Mark Zuckerberg’s Altruism Helps Himself\\", The New York Times, 3 December 2015 (page visited on 4 December 2015).Kerry Dolan, \\"Mark Zuckerberg Explains Why The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Isn't A Charitable Foundation\\", Forbes, 4 December 2015 (page visited on 5 December 2015).John Cassidy, \\"Mark Zuckerberg and the Rise of Philanthrocapitalism\\", The New Yorker, 2 December 2015 (page visited on 4 December 2015). Under this legal structure, as Forbes wrote it, \\"Zuckerberg will still control the Facebook shares owned by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\\". The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative publicly lists its grants, a level of transparency not required for an LLC. It has pledged to release software developed by it or its grantees under open-source licenses.

From 1840 to 1848, he studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam with Jan Willem Pieneman.Profile @ the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie website. After graduating, he married the actress Christina Margaretha Bartels (1822-1897). From 1852, he was an assistant teacher at the Academie. During these years, he focused on painting scenes from Dutch history. In 1854, he collaborated with Barend Wijnveld to produce a massive canvas depicting the heroic defense of Haarlem led by Kenau Hasselaer in 1573. Later, he would turn to landscapes, domestic scenes and portraits, including a series for the Rijksuniversiteit.Portrait Collection @ the University of Groningen website. In 1857, he was appointed Headmaster of the Academie Minerva in Groningen. In addition to his work there, he became a photographer and, in 1864, opened the first photography studio in Groningen. The following year, he resigned his position as Headmaster to devote himself entirely to photography. Shortly after, he opened a branch studio in Leeuwarden and hired his niece Louise's husband to be the manager. He soon discovered, however, that he could not support his family on his photographic work alone and was allowed to return to his former position at the Academie, where he remained until 1895. Among his best-known students there were Otto Eerelman, Albert Hahn, Hendrik Willem Mesdag and Franciscus Hermanus Bach. In 1868, a competition was held to design a new memorial for Adolf of Nassau, honoring his death at the Battle of Heiligerlee.

It was built in 1801 to commemorate the locality's status as a city, which had been granted by Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim on 14 September 1797. History Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, the Grand Master of the Order of St. John, attended the feast of the village of Żabbar on 10 September 1797. The inhabitants welcomed the Grand Master's visit, and the parish priest, Don Carlo Caruana, requested that the village be elevated to the status of a city. Hompesch agreed and gave Żabbar the title Città Hompesch by a decree dated 14 September 1797. Hompesch Gate as viewed from the back Following the elevation of their village to a city, the people of Żabbar wanted to build a monument to the Grand Master. In 1798, the French invasion of Malta expelled Hompesch and the Order from the island. The invasion was followed by a brief French occupation and a Maltese uprising, before Malta became a British protectorate in 1800. These political upheavals delayed the construction of a monument. The gate illuminated at night In December 1801, while repair works were being made to the Żabbar Sanctuary, Don Caruana decided to build the Hompesch Gate. The arch does not make any reference to the Grand Master or the Order, due to the sensitive political context in which it was constructed. An armorial crest was supposed to surmount the arch, and although the sculpture was begun it was never finished. The Hompesch Gate was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The arch is now scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture Hompesch Gate is built in the neoclassical style. It consists of a single arched opening, flanked by two pairs of Doric pilasters. The arch is topped by a triangular pediment, below which lies a depiction of Our Lady of Graces.

Instead of being able to identify one type of magician, there were many who practiced several types of magic in these times, including: monks, priests, physicians, surgeons, midwives, folk healers, and diviners. The practice of “magic” often consisted of using medicinal herbs for healing purposes. Classical medicine entailed magical elements, they would use charms or potions in hopes of driving out a sickness.  Medieval Magic   Medical Magic  Medicinal practices in the Middle Ages were often regarded as forms of “natural magic”. One in particular was referred to as a “leechbook”, or a doctor-book that included masses to be said over the healing herbs. For example, a procedure for curing skin disease first involves an ordinary herbal medicine followed by strict instructions to draw blood from the neck of the ill, pour it into running water, spit three times and recite a sort of spell to complete the cure. In addition to the leechbook, the Lacnunga included many prescriptions derived from the European folk culture that more intensely involved magic. The Lacnunga prescribed a set of Christian prayers to be said over the ingredients used to make the medicine, and such ingredients were to be mixed by straws with the names “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John” inscribed on them. In order for the cure to work, several charms had to be sung in Latin over the medicine. Charms Prayers, blessings, and adjurations were all common forms of verbal formulas whose intentions were hard to distinguish between the magical and the religious. Prayers were typically requests directed to a holy figure such as God, a saint, Christ, or Mary. Blessings more often were addressed to patients, and came in the form of wishes for good fortune. Adjurations, also known as exorcisms were more directed to either a sickness, or the agent responsible such as a worm, demon, or elf. While these three verbal formulas may have had religious intentions, they often played a role in magical practices. When the emphasis of a prayer so apparently relied on the observance of religiously irrelevant conditions, we can characterize it as magical. Blessings were more often than not strictly religious as well, unless they were used alongside magic or in a magical context. However, adjurations required closer scrutiny, as their formulas were generally derived from folklore. The command targeted at the sickness or evil left the possibility of refusal, meaning the healer entered a battle with the devil in which he or she relied on a holy power to come to his/her aid. Though people at this age were less concerned with whether or not these verbal formulas involved magic or not, but rather with the reality of if they were or were not successful.  Sorcery  Not only was it difficult to make the distinction between the magical and religious , but what was even more challenging was to distinguish between helpful (white) magic from harmful (black) magic. Medical magic and protective magic were regarded as helpful, and called ‘white’, while sorcery was considered evil and ‘black’. Distinguishing between black magic and white magic often relied on perspective, for example, if a healer attempted to cure a patient and failed, some would accuse the healer of intentionally harming the patient. In this era, magic was only punished if it was deemed to be ‘black’, meaning it was the practice of a sorcerer with harmful intentions Kieckhefer, Richard (1989). Magic in the Middle Ages. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. .  Early Opposition to Magic  One of the main reasons magic was condemned was because those who practiced it put themselves at risk of physical and spiritual assault from the demons they sought to control. However, the overarching concern of magical practices was the grievous harm it could do to others. Magic represented a huge threat to an age that widely professed belief in religion and holy powers.  Legal Prohibitions of Magic  Legislation against magic could be one of two types, either by secular authorities or by the Church. The penalties assigned by secular law typically included execution, but were more severe based on the impact of the magic, as people were less concerned with the means of magic, and more concerned with its effects on others. The penalties by the Church often required penance for the sin of magic, or in harsher cases could excommunicate the accused under the circumstances that the work of magic was a direct offense against God. The distinction between these punishments, secular versus the Church, were not absolute as many of the laws enacted by both parties were derived from the other The persecution of magic can be seen in law codes dating back to the 6th century, where the Germanic code of Visigoths condemned sorcerers who cursed the crops and animals of peasant's enemies. In terms of secular legislation, Charles the Great (Charlemagne) was arguably the strongest opposing force to magic. He declared that all who practiced sorcery or divination would become slaves to the Church, and all those who sacrificed to the Devil or Germanic gods would be executed. Charlemagne's objection to magic carried over into later years, as many rulers built on his early prohibitions. King Roger II of Sicily punished the use of poisons by death, whether natural or magical. Additionally, he proclaimed that ‘love magic’ be punished regardless of if anyone was hurt or not. However, secular rulers were still more concerned with the actual damage of the magic rather than the means of its infliction. Instructions issued in 800 at a synod in Freising provide general outlines for ecclesiastical hearings. The document states that those accused of some type of sorcery were to be examined by the archpriest of the diocese in hopes of prompting a confession. Torture was used if necessary, and the accused were often sentenced to prison until they resolved to do penance for their sins.  Prosecution in the Early Middle Ages  Important political figures were the most frequently known characters in trials against magic, whether defendants, accusers, or victims. This was because high-society trials were more likely to be recorded as opposed to trials involving ordinary townspeople or villagers. For example, Gregory of Tours recorded the accusations of magic at the royal court of 6th century Gaul. According to History of the Franks, two people were executed for supposedly bewitching emperor Arnulf and prompting the stroke that lead to his death.  Magic in the Later Middle Ages  The concept of magic was further developed in the high and late Middle Ages. The rise of legal commentaries and consultations during this time lead to the inclusion of law in Universities’ curricula. This fueled a detailed reflection of the principles underlying prosecution for magic. The early fourteenth century brought about the pinnacle of trials involving magic. In this time, several individuals were charged with using magic against both Pope John XXII and the King of France. These trials only enhanced the already growing concern about magic, and thus perpetuated the increasing severity of punishments for such actions. The increase in trials in the late Middle Ages was also in part due to the shift from accusatory to inquisitorial procedures. In accusatory procedures, the accuser had to provide ample evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. If the accuser failed to do so, or did not have any proof, he or she would have to face the punishment that would have been assigned to the accused had he/she been found guilty. The inquisitorial procedure allowed judges to undertake prosecution on their own initiative without consequences. This made it easier for the accuser to secure conviction for sorcery, and not have to worry about having insufficient evidence thus putting their own innocence in jeopardy. Inquisitorial interrogation took many forms, including experiments with reflecting surfaces, invocation of demons, use of human heads to obtain love or hatred, and more. Another possible reason for the rise in frequency of trials regarding magic in the later fourteenth century was due to a change from parchment to a cheaper medium of paper. This made it cheaper for more information to be recorded and preserved, therefore we have a greater volume of documented information from this era. While this may have caused a slight increase in trials against magic, the main reason was in fact the new inquisitorial procedure of trial and prosecution as mentioned above.  The Rise of Witch Trials  The fourteenth century already brought about an increase of sorcery trials, however the second and third quarters of the fifteenth century were known for the most dramatic uprising of trials involving witchcraft. The trials developed into catch-all prosecution, in which townspeople were encouraged to seek out as many suspects as possible. The goal was no longer to secure justice against a single offender but rather to purge the community of all transgressors. The term “witchcraft” has multiple connotations, all involving some type of sorcery or magic. However, by the late Middle Ages this term developed into someone who went beyond mere sorcery and acted in league with other witches on behalf of the Devil. Friars preached that not only are the witches who work for the devil guilty, but also all those who fail to report these culprits. This led to an outbreak of accusations, in fear of being accused themselves. Trials inspired more trials, and this increase in trials inspired the rise in the frequency of literature on witches. The famed culmination of this literary tradition was the Malleus maleficarum written in 1486 by Jacob Sprenger and Henry Kramer. This classic case of misogynist witchcraft treatise and its impact on magic in the Middle Ages will be explored later in this article. The growing popularity of literature regarding witchcraft and magic lead to an even greater upsurge in trials and prosecutions of witches.Pavlac, Brian (2009). Witch Hunts in the Western World: Persecution and Punishment from the Inquisition through the Salem Trials: Persecution and Punishment from the Inquisition through the Salem Trials. ABC-CLIO. . The stereotype of the witch finally solidified in the late Middle Ages. Numerous texts singled out women to be especially inclined to witchcraft. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, women defendants outnumbered men two to one. This difference only became more pronounced in the following centuries. The disparity between women and men defendants was primarily due to the position women held in late medieval society. Women in this era were far less trusted than men, as they were presumably weak minded and easily dissuaded. General misogynist stereotypes further encouraged their prosecution, which lead to a more stiffened stereotype of witches. Massive witch trials swept across Europe in the second half of the fifteenth century. In 1428, more than 100 people were burned for killing others, destroying crops, and working harm by means of magic. This trial in the Valais provided the first evidence for the fully developed stereotype of a witch, including flight through the air, transforming humans into animals, eating babies and the veneration of the Devil. The unrestricted use of torture in combination with the adoption of inquisitorial procedures as well as the development of the witch stereotype and a dramatic rise in public suspicion ultimately caused the swelling fervor and frequency of these sweeping witch hunts.  Malleus Maleficarum  Practices such as alchemy, medicinal magic, charms, and sorcery have been dated back centuries before they were considered evil. The Catholic Church condemned such practices in about 900 AD (3), but it was not until Malleus Maleficarum was published in 1487 that individuals who practiced things considered as “witchcraft” were punished severely. Malleus Maleficarum was published by a Catholic clergyman in Germany. It was written in Latin and the title roughly translates to “Hammer of the Witches”.Mackay, Christopher S. (2006). Malleus Maleficarum (2 volumes). Cambridge University Press. . (Latin) (English) Before the publication of Malleus Maleficarum, an individual was barely punished if accused of practicing any form of magic. Post-publication of this document changed the way that medieval society treated anyone who performed anything considered an act of magic or witchcraft. Malleus Maleficarum was used as a judicial book of guidelines within secular courts of Europe over three hundred years past its date of publication. Its main two purposes were to inform the audience about how to detect individuals who practice magic and how to prosecute said individuals. The document was divided into three parts, each of which dealt with something different within the process of persecution. The first section discusses what makes witchcraft real and how it is a very present threat to their current society. This section also makes the connection between witches and the Devil. In the second part, actual acts of magic are discussed. Chapters within this section are titled with various spells that the witches might perform, such as “How they are transported from Place to Place”, “How Witches Impede and Prevent the Power of Procreation”, “Of the Manner whereby they Change Men into the Shapes of Beasts”, etc.Malleus Maleficarum (1486) translated by Montague Summers (1928) http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/ They identify various magical practices with the idea of witchcraft, thus condemning many acts of magic that have been performed for centuries as crimes punishable by death. This section also discusses various remedies by which one can protect themselves against the actions of witches, many of these remedies being reminiscent of various magical acts. The third section discusses the actual prosecution of witches, and the procedure by which one must follow. It defines the use of prosecution, defense, witnesses, and punishments. It is essentially a guide on how to convict an individual of witchcraft.

It was dedicated to 'plebeian chastity' and built in 296 BC by Virginia, wife of the future consul Lucius Volumnius, in a section of her own house. According to Livy, (10.23.6-10), it was built in opposition to a shrine or temple to Pudicitia Patricia (whose existence is not definite and may be a conflation with the Temple of Fortuna) after the patrician-born Virginia was excluded from the latter after her marriage to a plebeian. Livy states that the cult declined and was forgotten due to women's extreme openness and opposition to the concept of chastity, though Festus in the 2nd century AD stated that its cult was still active. If still in use by the 4th-and 5th century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

The city's park surrounds the castle which now serves as a museum and tourist center.  History  The castle is thought to have been built in the 13th–15th century, but the original building was destroyed and the current building was built on the foundation of its predecessor in the 16th century. The castle was surrounded by walls and had an upper and lower courtyard. In the 17th century, the castle was inhabited by the noble family, Decuypere, who controlled the city's cloth industry. In the 18th century, however, the castle became the property of the family, de Potter. Halfway through the 19th century, the castle became the property of René Van Oye who, in 1863, started a linen factory in the building. Between 1850 and 1874, he built a few houses around the property for his employees. Between 1880 and 1885, the castle was almost entirely rebuilt, and in 1906, a man named Oscar Hostyn bought the property and converted the castle into a shoe factory. The castle's current interior design dates from 1912–1913. During World War I, when Torhout was occupied by the invading German forces, Ravenhof castle was used as a residence for German soldiers. In 1920, the castle was restored and later sold to the Couppé family. From 1960 onward, the castle and the surrounding domain began to decay.  Current use  The castle was restored again in 1993–1994.

Rivara has also researched bicycle helmets, intimate partner violence, and alcohol abuse, among other topics. Education Rivara earned his doctor of medicine in 1974 from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1980, he completed a master's in public health at the University of Washington. Career Rivara's career spans 30 years. His research has covered topics such as alcohol abuse and domestic violence, and he has been a vocal advocate for the use of bicycle helmets to reduce injury. Rivara says that his work has helped to drastically reduce the number of children who are injured while riding bikes. He founded the Harborview Injury and Research Center in Seattle and the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention. At the University of Washington, Rivara is vice chair of the Department of Pediatrics in the School of Medicine and chief of the Division of General Pediatrics and. Rivara is also editor-in-chief of the journal JAMA Pediatrics. Gun violence research In the 1990s, Rivara received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research the relationship between gun ownership and gun violence. His research found that the chances of homicide or suicide increase threefold when there is a gun present in a home, while the risk of suicide for teens increases as much as tenfold. Rivara and his colleagues published their research in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 in a series of articles on their findings. “[Our research] underwent peer review and was thought to be very solid and worthwhile research,” Rivara told PRI program The Takeaway in a 2015 interview. “The CDC stood by our research—they had funded it and they stood by it. Unfortunately, it raised the attention of the National Rifle Association, who then worked with pro-gun members of Congress to essentially stop funding firearm research.” The NRA then lobbied Congress, saying that since guns aren't a disease, CDC funds should not be allocated to them. A bill passed that prevented the CDC from setting aside funds for gun research. Awards Some awards Rivara has received include: *Charles C.

It is the United States's oldest continuous community band sponsored by local government and funded, in part, by tax monies. Originally a brass band, the band was formed in 1855 as the Mountain Sax Horn Band. It was also called Turner's Silver Cornet Band by 1859, for its first director, A. J. Turner. At the onset of the American Civil War, the band was mustered into the 5th Virginia Infantry Regiment, part of the Stonewall Brigade under Stonewall Jackson. Antebellum history Alto saxhorn used in the band's antebellum performances. In Staunton, Virginia in 1855 one David W. Drake wished to found a band. He enlisted the help of his former music teacher in Newtown. Drake prevailed upon A. J. Turner to move to Staunton. These two and other white, male citizens of the city formed the Mountain Saxhorn Band. The band's first formal concert occurred on July 17, 1857 at Union Hall on Beverley Street in Staunton. During the 1850s, the band began a tradition of playing for civic occasions, including political rallies held for Presidents Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce and candidates Stephen A. Douglas and John C. Breckinridge.http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?051+ful+HJ626ER On April 4, 1861, Turner's Silver Cornet Band, together with the Staunton Musical Association and the Glee Club, presented at Armory Hall the last concert that was to be given before the Civil War. Civil War The band earned the name Stonewall Brigade Band soon after First Manassas, and has been known as such ever since. In addition to their instruments, the band members also fought and acted as couriers and letter bearers or medical assistants. In addition to entertaining the troops in the field, they frequently appeared in concerts in Fredericksburg, Richmond, Staunton, and elsewhere to help recruiting rallies, clothing drives, and war relief fund raising. The band was in Stonewall Jackson's (pictured) brigade On August 22, 1861, Stonewall Jackson wrote to his wife \\"I wish my darling could be with me now and enjoy the sweet music of the brass band of the Fifth Regiment. It is an excellent band.\\" Jackson was fond of music, but had no talent for it, and confessed he could not recognize one song from another. Post war reorganization The band was reorganized in 1869 with A. J. serving as leader. His son T. M. Turner served as assistant leader. By 1875 the band was formally known as the Stonewall Brigade Band. The band's instruments from the time of the Civil War are still exhibited in their band room. They were apparently allowed to keep them as they were considered personal possessions, but several legends grew that Ulysses S. Grant allowed the band to keep their instruments through some special order. Perhaps due to the legend, the band grew a certain fondness for Grant, and on June 30, 1874, the band greeted Grant in Staunton with several songs. Upon being asked, Mayor Trout identified the band as the Stonewall Brigade Band. Grant responded with a murmur: \\"The Immortal Jackson\\". The Band also played at Grant's funeral in 1885. On April Fools Day 1878, the band was sent a letter that the Governor had appointed them to play in Paris.http://www.newsleader.com/story/news/history/2017/08/24/april-fools- joke-targeted-stonewall-brigade-band/599793001/ In 1885 the band presented the daughter of Stonewall Jackson a wedding gift of a souvenir band roster printed on white satin.

The Temple of Jupiter Feretrius (Latin: Aedes Iuppiter Feretrius) was the first temple ever built in Rome (the second was Etruscan and became known as the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus). Its site is uncertain but is thought to have been on the Capitoline Hill. It was said to have been dedicated to the god Jupiter by Romulus after his defeat of Acro, king of the Ceninensi, in 752–751 BC. The origin of the epithet 'Feretrius' is unclear and may relate to one of two Latin verbs - 'ferire' (making it mean 'he who strikes', since the spolia opima was offered there) or 'ferre' (making it mean 'he to whom [the spolia opima] are brought'). According to Cornelius Nepos, by the middle years of the first century BC the temple had lost its roof after many years of neglect. As a result, the emperor Augustus decided to rebuild it on the suggestion of Titus Pomponius Atticus, the wealthy equestrian most famous for being the friend and confidant of Cicero.Cornelius Nepos, Life of Atticus 20.3 Augustus subsequently included the temple in his autobiography, the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, within the list of monuments and temples in Rome that he paid to have rebuilt.Augustus, Res Gestae Divi Augusti 19 If still in use by the 4th- century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

He was prepared for College in New Haven and graduated from Yale College in 1863. In January, 1864, he began the study of medicine in Troy. Later, he attended lectures in the Albany Medical College, and from October, 1865, to March, 1867, was a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, in New York City, from which institution at the latter date he received his medical diploma. The care of an invalid father then intervened, to prevent his entering on the practice of his profession. Removing to New Haven, he was closely occupied with this filial responsibility until death released him in 1875. His residence continued in New Haven, and for several years he devoted much time and labor, gratuitously, to the care and increase of Yale's collection of coins. He had also formed a valuable collection of his own, and was well-versed in the study of the subject. A permanent evidence of his interest and generosity is shown in the Catalogue of Greek and Roman Coins in the Numismatic Collection of Yale College (New Haven, 1880. 236 pp. 8vo), which he edited with characteristic thoroughness, and which was printed largely at his own expense. Dr. Edwards also made extensive collections for a history of the Edwards family. He was married, February 28, 1882, to Marion Collins, youngest daughter of the late David C. Collins, of New Haven, who survived him. After his marriage. Dr. Edwards and his wife spent a year in Europe, but he returned from abroad with his constitution undermined by Roman fever, and his general health quite shattered. The rest of his life was passed in increasing weakness in New Haven, where he died June 19, 1886, in the 45th year of his age.

Education Heydari attended Sharif University of Technology in Tehran and received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering in 1992 and 1995, respectively. He obtained his Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California in 2001. In 1997, he worked at Bell-labs, Lucent Technologies on noise analysis in high-speed CMOS integrated circuits fields. In 1998 he worked at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center on gradient-based optimization and sensitivity analysis of custom analog/RF ICs. Career Heydari is a professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine. His research in the design of terahertz and millimeter- wave integrated circuits in silicon resulted in the world's first CMOS fundamental frequency transceiver operating at 210 GHz and the first terahertz closed-loop synthesizer source operating at 300 GHz in silicon. He introduced the first dual-band radar-on-chip with applications in automotive sensing and safety. His contribution in millimeter-wave imaging led to the invention of new concept called \\"super pixels\\" in the context of imaging array receivers. Heydari and his team discovered new transceiver architectures that obviate the need for high resolution data converters. This discovery led to the first \\"beyond-5G\\" integrated transceiver chipsets in silicon.

The site's editorial director is James Burnett. History John Feinblatt said the idea for The Trace stemmed from the difficulties faced by Everytown for Gun Safety, where he serves as President, to obtain \\"information about gun violence\\". He used the example of the Tiahrt Amendment (named after its author U.S. Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS)), a provision of the 2003 DOJ appropriations bill that prohibited the ATF's National Tracing Center from sharing its firearms trace database with anyone besides law enforcement agencies or prosecutors in a criminal investigation. The Amendment also \\"blocks any data legally released from being admissible in civil lawsuits against gun sellers or manufacturers,\\" and is supported by the National Rifle Association (NRA). Everytown for Gun Safety, and other organizations say that gun trace data is \\"important information needed for solving crimes such as \\"tracing guns from the point of sale to their use in violent crimes\\". Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg had founded Everytown for Gun Safety \\"which was created after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 where more than 20 people died, most of them young children. The editorial news director, James Burnett said, \\"We do bring a point of view to the issue of gun violence: We believe there is too much of it.

In a partnership with The Atlantic, The Trace investigated the reasons the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has an annual budget of over $11 billion, stopped doing research on gun violence. In a Trace interview, Mark L. Rosenberg, a founder of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, the division of the agency responsible for doing gun violence research, Rosenberg said that it was \\"the leadership of the CDC who stopped the agency from doing gun violence research. The Injury Center, established by Rosenberg and five colleagues in 1992, had an annual budget of c. $260,000 focused on \\"identifying the root causes of firearm deaths and the best methods to prevent them\\". Rosenberg told The Trace in 2016, \\"Right now, there is nothing stopping them from addressing this life-and-death national problem.\\" It was previously assumed that the research was not being done because of a sentence in the 1996 Dickey Amendment, which was supported by the NRA, and inserted into the 1996 appropriations bill which stated \\"none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control\\". In 1997, \\"Congress redirected all of the money previously earmarked for gun violence research to the study of traumatic brain injury.\\" David Satcher, who was the CDC head from 1993 to 1998, advocated for gun violence research until he left in 1998. In 1999 Rosenberg was fired. Over a dozen \\"public health insiders, including current and former CDC senior leaders\\" told Trace interviewers that CDC senior leaders took an overly cautious stance in their interpretation of the Dickey amendment. They could have done much more. Themes The Trace keeps track of NRA spending on elections. The NRA broke its own record of $31.7 million in 2014 with $36.3 million in 2016 in support of Donald Trump's candidacy for president. Dispute with Students for Concealed Carry An investigation by Adam Weinstein, published in The Trace in 2015, described Students for Concealed Carry (SCC), an organization that supports campus carry, as being backed and influenced by the Leadership Institute (LI), an organization sponsoring conservative student activism, and Gun Owners of America, a gun- rights lobbying organization. SCC, in turn, denied being founded by or receiving regular funding from outside groups, claiming that the organization is student-run while also acknowledging ties to other gun-rights organizations and saying that some campus chapters received grants from the Leadership Institute. The Gunfighters The NPR described \\"The Trace\\" as independent journalism organization \\"dedicated to covering America's gun violence crisis.\\" Mike Spies, who has been reporting on the gun lobby since 2015, wrote a series called \\"The Gunfighters\\", which investigated the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA) on state gun policy and politics, including the NRA's promotion of a grading system for lawmakers from A+ to F (published in an article with the New York Daily News), and the role of the NRA and NRA lobbyists such as Marion Hammer in opposing proposed legislation requiring the safe storage of weapons and in promoting \\"stand-your-ground\\" legislation. In articles in 2016, Spies described how the NRA began to use their scoring system to influence judicial nominations. The first attempt was during the confirmation proceedings of Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 at the request of Mitch McConnell and again in 2010 with Elena Kagan. In 2011, the NRA opposed Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and as a result, Senate Republicans blocked her confirmation. In 2016, the NRA opposed the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because he did not \\"respect the individual right to bear arms\\" - in 2007, Garland had \\"cast a vote in favor of allowing his court to review a crucial opinion by a three-judge panel that had found D.C.'s handgun ban unconstitutional.\\" This article was cited in The Second Amendment and Gun Control: Freedom, Fear, and the American Constitution which presented both sides of the debate between those who \\"favour more gun controls and those who would prefer fewer of them.\\" References Internet properties established in 2015 Michael Bloomberg American news websites ","title":"The Trace (website)"},{"id":"48714518","text":"The Capitoline Base or Vicomagistri Base is a marble statue base dedicated to Hadrian in 136 by the 'vicomagistri' or masters of the shrines and temples of Rome.

The mechanism of the mutation is that the negative charge of the acidic glutamic acid residue causes it to be phosphomimetic. This mimics the phosphorylation of the nearby T599 threonine and S602 serine residues in the activation segment of BRAF, which are used to activate the wild type form of the protein. The glutamate residue of the mutant therefore functions to activate BRAF by inhibiting the interaction of the BRAF's glycine rich loop and activation segment, which would ordinarily be inhibitory. The loss of inhibition of BRAF leads to an increase in its basal activity and hence is oncogenic.

Its precise location is unknown, though Vitruvius states it stood near the Theatre of Pompey. No evidence of it remains after 22 AD, meaning it was probably lost in the fire of 21 AD, which also damaged the Theatre of Pompey. The temple was built by Quintus Fulvius Flaccus in fulfilment of a vow to the goddess in exchange for her support during his campaign in Hispania in 180 BC. He was allowed a triumph in Rome for his victory over the Celtiberians and built the temple in its memory. 'Equestris' refers to the equites, then seen as key to Roman victories. Flaccus dedicated it in 173 BC, when he was censor. Flaccus had much of the marble roof of the Temple of Juno Lacinia in Kroton brought to Rome for use in the temple, but this led to outrage on the part of the senate, in that a censor (responsible for public morality) had not only partially demolished a temple belonging to one of Rome's allies, but also by doing so brought down the wrath of the gods upon Rome. The senate ordered him to send the roof back to Kroton and restore the temple he had damaged. See also *List of Ancient Roman temples References *L.

She was an alternate member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, one of the few women to have entered China's top decision-making body. Early life Chen Muhua was born in 1921 in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, during the Republic of China period. Her uncle was a Kuomintang air force official who helped her complete high school education, but she was sympathetic to the Communist cause and went to Yan'an, the wartime base of the Communists, in 1938, after the outbreak of the Second Sino- Japanese War. She told her mother that she would return in six months, but was unable to go home until the end of the war in 1945, when her mother had already died. Chen studied military science at the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an, and joined the Communist Party of China. Her teachers included Zhu De, Chen Yun, and Otto Braun (known in China as \\"Li De\\"). During the Yan'an Rectification Movement, she was subject to constant investigation because of her Kuomintang uncle, despite being pregnant. She was forced to give away her daughter when she was born in 1943. The investigation ended only with the intervention of Zhou Enlai. During the Chinese Civil War, she worked a number of jobs in the Rehe Military Region. People's Republic of China After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Chen worked in economic areas, serving as head of the Railway and Long-term Planning offices of the State Planning Commission's Transport Bureau in the 1950s. In the 1960s, she worked in the Foreign Economic Relations General Liaison Office, where she was in charge of China's foreign aid to African countries. During the Cultural Revolution, Chen was labeled a \\"capitalist roader\\", partly because she had suggested that cadres dealing with foreign countries should learn foreign languages. There was also rumour that Chen Cheng, the Kuomintang Vice-President of the Republic of China on Taiwan, was her uncle. Chen Muhua's brother was persecuted to death in Heilongjiang Province. Chen was politically rehabilitated and appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade in 1970, reporting directly to Premier Zhou Enlai. In 1978, Chen became a vice premier (and a vice premier-level state councilor after 1982), the highest non-honorary government position achieved by a woman at the time. When China initiated its family planning policy in the early 1980s, she was put in charge of the National Family Planning Commission. She also served as Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, and implemented policies that encouraged export, which grew to over US$30 billion. In 1985, she was appointed Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank. Under her leadership, China became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1986. She served as a board member of the ADB, as well as the African Development Bank. After leaving her PBOC post in 1988, she was appointed chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation. Chen Muhua was an alternate member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, one of the few women to have entered China's top decision-making body. Although Jiang Qing, Ye Qun, and Deng Yingchao also became Politburo members, they were all wives of China's top leaders and did not hold executive positions. Family In 1940, Chen married Zhong Yi (), a graduate of Harbin Institute of Technology, in Yan'an. Zhong served as a military commander in the 1960s, but retired early due to poor health. They had four daughters. She was forced to give away her newborn second daughter in 1943, when she was under investigation during the Rectification Movement. After 1949, Chen spent decades searching for the daughter, until they were finally reunited in 1975. Death On 12 May 2011, Chen Muhua died of an illness in Beijing, aged 90. General Secretary Hu Jintao and all the members of the Politburo Standing Committee attended her funeral. She was eulogized as a \\"excellent party member, a long-tested fighter of the Communist cause, a proletarian revolutionary, an outstanding leader in the realm of economic affairs and women and children affairs.\\" She was buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.

She is currently Professor of Vaccinology at the Medical University of Vienna. Wiedermann's work in the field of B cell peptide vaccines led to the creation of HER-Vaxx, an immunotherapy for the treatment of HER-2-positive cancers. This vaccine is currently being taken into mid-stage clinical development in gastric cancer by the biotech company Imugene, where Wiedermann is Chief Scientific Officer.  Background  After obtaining an MD degree from the Medical University of Vienna, Wiedermann gained a PhD in Immunology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, where the focus of her PhD work was mucosal immunity and vaccination. After returning to the Medical University of Vienna Wiedermann researched mucosal vaccination against allergic diseases and later began to look at vaccine development against infectious diseases and tumours as well as explore the issues of immune responsiveness and immune failures upon vaccination. Wiedermann became head of Vienna's Institute of Specific Prophylaxis and Tropical Medicine in 2004 and was named Professor of Vaccinology in 2006.  Allergy research  A theme of Wiedermann's allergy research has been the treatment of allergies via mucosal tolerance induction with recombinant allergens, probiotics or other microbes. For a key 2001 paper in the International Archives of Allergy and Immunology Wiedermann used recombinant fragments of the birch pollen allergen Bet v I to induce mucosal tolerance in a mouse model of birch pollen allergy. In 2008 the Wiedermann lab challenged the 'microflora hypothesis', which holds that altered microflora contributed to allergies, by showing that Bet v 1 could induce mucosal tolerance in mice regardless of the presence or absence of microflora. In 2009 the Wiedermann lab provided some supporting evidence for the hygiene hypothesis of allergies by showing that infection with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii could prevent allergic immune responses in birch pollen allergic mice. In 2011 the Wiedermann lab showed in mice that probiotics could have anti-allergic effects against multiple allergens. In 2012 the Wiedermann lab showed that a fusion protein containing several allergens could treat birch pollen-related food allergy, in which patients are allergic to homologues of Bet v I. Also in 2012 the Wiedermann lab showed in mice that perinatal administration of Lactobacillus paracasei to pregnant and lactating mothers could protect against the development of airway inflammation in offspring.  Cancer immunotherapy research  Beginning around 2004 Wiedermann began to working on the technology that evolved into HER-Vaxx, a B cell peptide cancer immunotherapy that could induce an antibody response targeting HER-2 overexpressing tumours. Following on from favourable pre- clinical data, Wiedermann et al. ran a small 10-patient safety study of HER- Vaxx in ten patients with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer, albeit with low HER-2 expression. This study found the vaccine to be safe, with no observed cardiotoxicity. The patients developed anti-HER-2 antibodies and in vitro, those anti-HER-2 antibodies showed potent anti-tumour activity. Also in vitro, blood from the patients carried markers of a cellular immune response such as IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α (meaning that ultimately patients could be expected to develop T cells to kill the cancer cells, and not just antibodies). The vaccine took down the ‘T reg’ cell count in the patients, potentially indicating an overcoming of the cancer’s immunoresistance. In 2012 a start-up company called Biolife Science was incorporated to develop this immunotherapy. Early-stage funding was secured from Australian and US investors in 2013, after which Biolife was taken public in December 2013 in a reverse takeover of an Australian drug development company called Imugene, whose name was retained after the merger. Wiedermann joined Imugene's Scientific Advisory Board in January 2014 and was named Chief Scientific Officer of Imugene in June 2015.

It was a green steel arch bridge, and was built in 1956 over the Northeast Arm of Sheet Harbour. It had a half-through, two-hinge type arch, as well as a built-up box-cross section for support. The bridge was in length, with a main span of . The bridge had engineering ties with the Angus L. MacDonald Bridge in Halifax. The deck carried the two lanes of Trunk 7 and by extension the Marine Drive scenic route, and was hung from the arch by vertical steel wide flange shape hangers. The ribs of the bridge were heavily reinforced in 1988. As the bridge neared the end of its lifespan, it was replaced by a new bridge with the same name. Unlike the old bridge, the new bridge was designed without overhead steel arches that would have doubled the cost. Construction Construction of the $19 million bridge began in September 2014. The Nova Scotia Government contributed $11.8 million to the project, with the remaining $7.2 million coming from the Government of Canada. The contractor, Dexter Construction, poured of concrete over of rebar. The new bridge relies on two pillars set in the granite below the Northeast Arm. They were built with a technique which involved drilling steel pipes into the riverbed, then surrounding them with concrete and steel, instead of installing cofferdams, which would be more costly and would disrupt the river. Near completion, a deck, railings and sidewalks, were laid. It is built on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor, which was constructed in 1907. Unlike the old bridge, the new bridge was designed without overhead steel arches that would have doubled the cost. Overall, the structure is wider than the old bridge. It includes a wider shoulder for cyclists. Several modifications were made to the roads on the Sheet Harbour side, near the bridge. Trunk 7 was aligned with what was previously Riverside Drive, which is now non-existent. Church Point Road and Pool Road were aligned to the new Trunk 7\\\\. The access road to and Duncan MacMillan High School was slightly modified. A minor loop called Sprott Lane was extended along a part of the old Trunk 7 for a few households. There is no toll to access the bridge. The bridge opened on 17 December 2015, with a bridge walk, in which Sheet Harbour residents walked across the old bridge to commemorate its closure, then walked back across the new bridge signifying its opening. That same day, the new bridge was opened for pedestrians, and open to traffic the following day. The new bridge has a projected lifespan of at least 75 years, until 2090. It also has a sidewalk, which connects to Sheet Harbour's current sidewalk system. Officials hope this will encourage active transportation. The old East River Bridge was closed immediately after the bridge walk and demolition was completed in early September 2016.

Davidson, 2012 The purported background of some such associated feelings may be due to an egalitarian-related sentiment, whereby one feels a sense of solidarity with individuals in the lowest Human Development Index countries.An Excess of Phobias and Manias - Page 96, John G. Robertson - 2003 For others, a recurring thought that some things are too good to be true has resulted in an ingrainedness that they are not entitled to feel too good.Multi-Secularism: A New Agenda - Page 69, Paul Kurtz - 2014 Sometimes, it can be triggered by a religious upbringing wherein asceticism is propounded. Hedonophobia is formally defined as the fear of experiencing pleasure. 'Hedon' or 'hedone' comes from ancient Greek, meaning 'pleasure' + fear: 'phobia'. Hedonophobia is the inability to enjoy pleasurable experiences, and is often a persistent malady. Diagnosis of the condition is usually related to the age of 'maturity' in each country where the syndrome exists. For instance, in the US a person must be 18 years old to be considered an adult, whereas in Canada he or she must be 18 or 19 years old, depending on the province of residence. Globally, the ages range from (+/-) 12 to 24 years and are mainly determined by traditional ethical practices from previous societies. High anxiety, panic attacks, and extreme fear are symptoms that can result from anticipating pleasure of any kind. Expecting or anticipating pleasure at some point in the future can also trigger an attack. Hedonophobics have a type of guilt about feeling pleasure or experiencing pleasurable sensations, due to a cultural background or training (either religious or cultural) that eschews pleasurable pursuits as frivolous or inappropriate. Oftentimes, social guilt is connected to having fun while others are suffering, and is common for those who feel undeserving or have self-worth issues to work through. Also, there is a sense that they shouldn't be given pleasures due to their lack of performance in life, and because they have done things that are deemed \\"wrong\\" or \\"undeserving.\\" To determine the depth of the diagnosis for those who suffer from hedonophobia, background is crucial. For example, when a child is taught that a strong work ethic is all that makes them worthy of the good things in life, guilt becomes a motivator to move away from pleasure when they begin to experience it. The individual learns that pleasures are bad, and feeling good is not as sanctified as being empathetic towards those who suffer. C.B.T. (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is an effective approach to the resolution of past beliefs that infiltrate and affect the sufferer's current responses to various situations. Medication is only necessary when there is an interference in the person's normal daily functioning. Various techniques are used by those afflicted with the condition to hide, camouflage or mask their aversion to pleasure. Any relationship that includes things that are pleasurable is re- established when the sufferer learns that he is not worthy of anything pleasurable, or that he only deserves the opposite of those things which are pleasurable. A disconnect is necessary to determine the sufferer's lack of ability to intervene in the overall process.

Today it is operates as a branch of the Museum of the Warsaw Uprising. Description The Warsaw Fotoplastikon has 24 fixed stereoscopic viewports. A visitor sits at a viewport around the circumference of the machine. Each picture, from a sequence of 48 three dimensional stereo images, appears for 15 seconds before moving on to the next. Above each viewport is a window which displays an illuminated card with a brief description of the scene below. The scenes are arranged by themes, such as a travelogue to distant lands or depictions of historic events. Recorded music related to the theme plays in the background. The Fotoplastikon uses a slightly modified version of the Kaiserpanorama peepshow system, differing in having 24 viewports instead of 25 in the Kaiserpanorama system.Mark Witkowski, \\"The Warsaw Fotoplastikon\\", Mark Witkowski's Stereo (3D) Pages History The Warsaw Fotoplastikon was constructed in 1901. It was first shown at a temporary location but moved to its permanent location in a small theatre at the back of an inner courtyard of Kamienica Hoserów (Hoser Townhouse Apartment Building) at 51 Jerusalem Avenue soon after the building was built in 1905. The Warsaw Fotoplastikon is a Polish adaptation of the Kaiserpanorama peepshow technology invented in the 1890s which was popular across Europe before the growth of motion picture theatres. The Fotoplastikon has been operated at the 51 Jerusalem Avenue location since it opened, owned and run by a series of families more or less continuously since 1905 making it the oldest active in situ peepshow in Europe.Dorothy Januszewska, Museums in Warsaw Guide, BOSZ, Olszanica (2012), p. 11 Soon after the WW2 in 1946 it was reopened by Krempa (or Krępa) family which ran the theatre util 1973. In 1973 the new owner was Józef Chudy. After his death in 1980, the Fotoplastikon closed but was relaunched by Józef Chudy's grandson, Tomasz Chudy, in 1992. The Fotoplastikon was entered in the Polish Register of Monuments in 1987. In 2008 Chudy leased the device, along with a collection of 3,000 slides to the Museum of the Warsaw Uprising. In December 2012 the museum bought the equipment and has continued to operate it in the original location.\\"Fotoplastikon opens after renovation\\" Thomas Urzykowski, Warsaw Gazeta, 26 September 2013 In September 2013 Fotoplastikon gained an additional room, next to its original site adjacent to the Hoserow courtyard. Cultural Influence The Fotoplastikon served as a popular rendezvous point for many years, valued for its entertainment as well as providing a discrete location for couples to meet. In World War II, it was used by members of the Polish underground for clandestine meetings. The Kamienica Hoserów was one of the very few central Warsaw buildings not destroyed during World War II, allowing the Fotoplastikon to survive as a refuge from the horrors of the war and the hardship of the postwar communist era. It provided one of the few ways for Warsavians to view the outside world. The owners of the Fotoplastikon would loan their stereoscopic camera to Poles authorized to travel abroad and thus created new slide shows to supplement the Fotoplastikon's rare collection of original Kaiserpanorama historical travelogues. Imported jazz and pop records often served as the background music providing an opportunity for Poles to enjoy western music during the communist era. The Fotoplastikon has served as a period location for some Polish films, among them Polish Roads and This Honor.\\"100,000 viewers in Fotoplastykonie\\" Warsaw Gazeta, 2013-06-09 The Fotoplastikon served as an important setting in the 2013 Graphic novel The Property by Israeli author and illustrator Rutu Modan.

He also published several books on German politics and culture throughout the middle half of the 20th Century.  Life   In Germany  Speier attended the Helmholtz grammar school in Berlin, where he received his diploma in 1923. At the urging of his father, who was rattled by inflation, he began training as a banker, during which he heard lectures at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University during lunch before the actually intended studies. After one year he abandoned being a banker, and continued his tutoring in math, politics, and history on free mornings before his philosophy studies. After 1925, Speier majored in sociology and Economics and minored in philosophy and history at the University of Heidelberg. He received his doctorate after six semesters in 1929 with a dissertation on the philosophy of history. He was the first PhD student of sociologist Karl Mannheim, who he periodically studied with. Speier spent most of his time with Emil Lederer, whose assistant was already employed as a student. With support of Rudolf Hilferding (a friend of Lederer), Speier was appointed as editor of social sciences at the Ullstein-Verlag in Berlin in 1929. He served as Professor of sociology at the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik in 1931, and was also active in the worker education of the SPD. In 1932 he was also the assistant of Emil Lederer at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University. The Deutsche Hochschule für Politik was closed by the Nazis. His wife, Luise,http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/eresources/static/pdf/ger084.pdf lost her position as a public health doctor in the Wedding neighborhood of Berlin, because she was Jewish. In September 1933, he emigrated to the United States and followed his teacher Emil Lederer. His wife followed with his daughter in October 1933.  In the United States  Now living in New York, from 1933 to 1942 and from 1947 to 1948, he was Professor of political sociology at New School for Social Research. During the second world war and in the post-war years he worked only as a propaganda specialist; and then as Germany expert for the U.S. Government. Speier also lectured at the University of Illinois (1941) and the University of Michigan (1941). In 1948, he became the first Director of the Social Science Department of the RAND Corporation, a position he held for almost 15 years. In 1959, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. From 1969 to 1973, he followed Robert M. MacIver Professor, a professor of sociology and government at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. In 1976, he returned as a visiting professor at the New School for Social Research. He lived in Hartsdale, New York with his second wife, Margit Klein Speier, and died during a Sarasota, Florida vacation.  Sociological work  Throughout Speier's academic life he was constantly concerned with the knowledge of sociology and intellectual sociology, in particular was Marxism. In the 1930s, he also worked as a staff sociologist. However, his original investigation with the staff was never released because Nazism could no longer be published in 1933. Several chapters appeared in 1939 as a mimeographed edition in English. The complete book was not published in Germany until 1977, an English translation was not published until 1986. After the emigration itself Speier increasingly engaged in issues of militarism and posts prior to the sociology of war.

He catches 12-year-old Dan Mason (John Baer), an orphaned newsboy, using slugs. Dan admits he and all the other newsboys use slugs, winning jackpots to make money. Channing realizes he can drive other racketeers out of business by having the newsboys fill the slot machines with slugs. Channing becomes a father-figure to the boy. Ten years later, Channing has taken over all the rackets in the city and Di Bruno and Finetti now work for him. Dan is going to law school. Dan is adept at finding legal loopholes to help Tim and his gang avoid conviction. Dan is romancing Fern Fellows (Kathleen Crowley), daughter of a retired judge, so that he can get at the rare law books in her father's collection. He uses these books to find the loopholes that help Channing. When Dan's background is exposed, Fern makes him promise to stop being a crook. After graduating from law school, Dan persuades Channing to \\"go legit\\" (get out of the rackets and into legal business). Dan, meanwhile, opens a firm that supplies security guards. Di Bruno and Finetti pressure Channing to resume crime, and he starts a protection racket. Channing avoids targeting any firm employing Dan's security service. One of the district attorney's men, Phil Jergins (Richard Travis) begins to investigate Dan's firm in the belief that Dan is running the protection racket. Jergins pretends to be a public relations man, and is hired by Dan. Jergins nonchalantly gives Dan's secretary some pencils that secretly contain a luminous material. At night, Jergins collects the security company's records from the trash using ultraviolet light. Channing learns of the law's interest in Dan's firm, and alerts Dan. Dan is furious once he realizes that Channing only knew about the luminous pencils through his underworld contacts. In despair, Dan (who did not know that Channing was sparing him from the protection racket) decides to close his company and cancel his engagement to marry Fern. Channing goes to the district attorney and confesses his crimes to prove Dan's innocence. Dan relents, and he and Fern marry. Di Bruno and Finetti, realizing that Channing has ratted them out as well, shoot Channing. Channing, however, manages to shoot and kill the two gangsters in turn. Channing dies in Dan's arms, telling him, \\"When you play with slugs, you get slugged on another day.\\" Cast *Victor McLaglen as Big Tim Channing *John Baer as Dan Mason *Kathleen Crowley as Fern Fellows *Anthony Caruso as Tony Finetti *Richard Reeves as Angelo Di Bruno *Frank Ferguson as District Attorney Hunt *Richard Travis as Phil Jergins  References   External links  * 1955 films American films English-language films American crime films 1955 crime films Republic Pictures films Films directed by William Witney ","title":"City of Shadows"},{"id":"48714977","text":"The Temple of Juno Regina (Latin: templum or aedes Iuno Regina) was a temple in ancient Rome dedicated to \\"Queen Juno\\".

In the background are Downtown and Mount Rainier Smith Tower (completed 1914) viewed from the north King Street Station and skyline The architecture of Seattle, Washington, the largest city in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S., features elements that predate the arrival of the area's first settlers of European ancestry in the mid-19th century, and has reflected and influenced numerous architectural styles over time. As of the early 21st century, a major construction boom continues to redefine the city's downtown area as well as neighborhoods such as Capitol Hill, Ballard and, perhaps most dramatically, South Lake Union.Overall citation for the boom: This article originally appeared in the June 2015 issue of Western Real Estate Business magazine. Native and native-influenced architecture Prior to the arrival of European settlers in the Puget Sound area, the largest building in the Salish Sea region was Old Man House, a longhouse roughly northwest of Downtown Seattle near the present-day town of Suquamish. Measuring roughly in length, it was the largest longhouse ever known and remained the largest building in the region until it was burned by the United States government in 1870. While there were no native structures of this scale within the city limits of present-day Seattle, the Duwamish tribe had at least 13 villages in that area. Of these, the largest and most important was dzee-dzee-LAH-letch or sdZéédZul7aleecH (\\"little crossing-over place\\") near present-day Pioneer Square, with an estimated 200 people in 1800, before Old World diseases caused massive death in the region. It consisted of eight longhouses, each roughly , and an even larger potlatch house. Although no significant architectural structures from the era before European settlement survive as anything more than archaeological sites, several present-day Seattle buildings deliberately evoke traditional regional Native American architecture. Examples of this include Daybreak Star Cultural Center in Discovery Park, owned by the United Indians of All Tribes; the Duwamish Longhouse, owned by the Duwamish tribe, just west of the Duwamish River, roughly across the street from the present- day Herring's House Park, whose name commemorates the second-largest historical Duwamish village, tohl-AHL-too (\\"herring's house\\") or hah-AH-poos (\\"where there are horse clams\\"); wǝɫǝbʔaltxʷ (\\"Intellectual House\\"), a multi- service learning and gathering space for Native American students, faculty and staff on the Seattle campus of the University of Washington; and Ivar's Salmon House, a restaurant on the north shore of Lake Union.

In Seattle, the two collaborated on Providence Hospital (built 1882–1883; destroyed 1911) at Fifth and Madison, the current site of the William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse. McKay was also responsible in the years 1882–1884 for a major enlargement of the now- demolished Catholic Church of Our Lady of Good Help, as well as designing the Occidental Hotel (First and Yesler, later site of the Seattle Hotel and now the \\"Sinking Ship\\" parking garage) and Seattle Engine House No. 1 (both lost in the 1889 Fire) and the Holy Names Academy at Seventh and Jackson (lost in the Jackson Street regrade of 1906). Pioneer Building, pictured circa 1900 Elmer H. Fisher, an exponent of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, came to prominence immediately after the 1889 fire; he designed many of the new \\"fireproof\\" buildings in what is now the Pioneer Square neighborhood. His best-known surviving building is the Pioneer Building (built 1889–1891) directly on Pioneer Square at First and Yesler; his equally grand Burke Building, built at the same time, was demolished to make way for the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building; a few of its decorative elements survive on the plaza of that Federal Building. Two other surviving Fisher buildings are also right at First and Yesler: the Yesler Building on the southwest corner and the Mutual of New York Building on the northwest corner, both initially built 1890–1891 and later enlarged. His Austin A. Bell Building (1889–1890, now Bell Apartments) remains an equally prominent feature of Belltown. p.24 specifically refers to the Pioneer Building and Burke Building as the two major commissions that established Fisher: \\"With these two commissions, Fisher emerged as the leading architect in Seattle just before the 1889 fire.\\" Bebb & Mendel's Washington State Building for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, a temporary structure on the University of Washington campus, which served as the exposition grounds Englishman Charles Herbert Bebb and German Louis Leonard Mendel made their separate ways to Seattle in the 1890s. Their partnership Bebb & Mendel (1901–1914) was the city's most prominent architectural firm during its period of activity. Among their many surviving buildings in Seattle are the University Heights School (first portion built 1902), now a community center; the William Walker House (built 1906–1907, also known as \\"Hill-Crest\\") in the Washington Park neighborhood, now the official residence of the president of the University of Washington; the First Church of Christ, Scientist on Capitol Hill (built in two phases, 1908–1909, 1912–14), now converted into condominium apartments; the Frye Hotel (built 1906–1911); the Hoge Building (built 1909–1911) briefly the city's tallest building; and Fire Station No. 18 (built 1910–1911) in Ballard, now a bar and restaurant. Exchange Building (1929–1931) Another Englishman who figured prominently in Seattle architecture was Liverpool-born John Graham, Sr. From 1905 to 1910 he was in partnership with David J. Myers; they designed houses, apartment buildings, and several Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition pavilions. A prominent surviving Myers-Graham building is the main (\\"Seaview\\") building of The Kenney, a retirement home in West Seattle. He established his own firm in 1910; his numerous downtown buildings in this period include the Joshua Green Building (1913); the Frederick and Nelson department store (1916–1919), now Nordstrom's flagship store; and the Dexter Horton Building (1921–1924), an office building for First Seattle Dexter Horton National Bank, later Seafirst Bank. Other buildings from this period include the Ford Assembly Plant Building (1913) near the southeast corner of Lake Union—later home to the printer Craftsman Press and is now used as a self-storage building—and the Seattle Yacht Club (1919–1921) in Montlake. In the late 1920s he began working along Art Deco lines, with such buildings as the Roosevelt Hotel (1928–1929); the Bon Marché (1928–1929), now a Macy's; and the Exchange Building (1929–1931). Grant Hildebrand counts the Exchange Building as \\"perhaps Graham's finest work.\\" He collaborated with Bebb and Gould on the U.S. Marine Hospital complex at the north end of Beacon Hill (1931–1934), later for more than a decade headquarters of Amazon.com, now Pacific Tower. Graham lived until 1955, but he collaborated with William L. Painter in New York City 1936–1942, and it was mainly Graham's son John Graham, Jr. who eventually built back up a Seattle practice for the firm. Harborview Hospital, still a prominent feature of Seattle's skyline, seen here from the Pioneer Square neighborhood Iowa-born Harlan Thomas started his career in Colorado and traveled widely before arriving in Seattle in his mid-30s in 1906. By the end of 1907, he had already made his mark with his own Mediterranean-style villa on the west slope of Queen Anne Hill, the eclectic Chelsea Family Hotel across from Kinnear Park, and the Italianate Sorrento Hotel on the First Hill edge of Downtown before adopting a more stripped-down style influenced by Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen. In the following years he designed a number of schools around Washington state and partnered with various other architects on prominent Seattle buildings: with Clyde Grainger he designed the Corner Market building in Pike Place Market (1911–1912); with W. Marbury Somervell, three Carnegie libraries (1912–1915); with Schack, Young & Myers the Seattle Chamber of Commerce Building (1923–1925); and in the partnership Thomas, Grainger, and Thomas (the latter Thomas being his own son Donald), Seattle's Rhodes Department Store (1926–1927, later Arcade Plaza Building, now demolished), William O. McKay Ford Sales and Service Building (1925, now reconstructed as part of the Allen Institute for Brain Science), and Harborview Hospital (1929–1931). Other projects in and around Seattle included two fraternal buildings at the University of Washington (the former Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, 1914, now Tau Kappa Epsilon, and the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, 1930), a 500-unit World- War II-era housing project in Bremerton, Washington, and speculative housing designed for developer Albert Balch in northeast Seattle. He also taught architecture at the University of Washington 1926–1940. Colman Park on the Lake Washington shore. Their Seattle Landmark status and recognition on the National Register of Historic Places has improved their chances of remaining in a neighborhood where few such modest residences remain. Ellsworth Storey was from Chicago, first visited Seattle as a teenager, and settled there in 1903 after earning an architecture degree from the University of Illinois. Like Harlan Thomas, he debuted in Seattle as his own client, building a home for his parents and an adjacent one for himself and his wife. These Ellsworth Storey Residences in Denny-Blaine, completed in 1905, already show his characteristic style; as Grant Hildebrand describes it, \\"deep eaves, horizontal stretches of mullioned glazing, and above all the imaginative use of modest local materials,\\" with influences from Swiss chalets, the Prairie School, and the English Arts and Crafts movement. (Bernard Maybeck in the San Francisco Bay Area seems to have arrived independently at a similar style.) \\"Although… hardly known nationally, few architects have engendered greater local affection.\\" Not all of Storey's work is in this style: for example, his 1908 house for J.K. Gordon in the Mount Baker neighborhood is Georgian Revival, and many of his buildings fall broadly under the heading of Tudor Revival, such as Hoo-Hoo House (1909)—which was built for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition and subsequently served until 1959 as the University of Washington Faculty Club—and a 1915–1916 Unitarian church, now University Presbyterian Church Chapel. In the 1920s, he designed numerous Seattle residences, church buildings, etc. Meanwhile, back in 1910–1915, Storey had acquired land near Colman Park on the Lake Washington shore and, on speculation, built a set of cottages in his characteristic style. This last proved a lucky thing for him, because in the Great Depression when there was little work for architects, he was still able to earn rents as a landlord while working on government projects such as parks throughout Western Washington and, during World War II, at Sand Point Naval Station. The graduate reading room, Suzzallo Library (Bebb & Gould, 1922–1927) After his partner Louis Mendel retired in 1914, Charles Bebb partnered with Carl F. Gould in the firm Bebb & Gould. Bebb was more the businessman and engineer; Gould—who in this same period founded the Department of Architecture at the University of Washington (U.W.)—the designer and planner. The firm's style evolved from Historicism toward Art Moderne. Early on, the firm designed the Times Square Building (1913–1915) for the Seattle Times, the Administration Building (1914–1916) of the Ballard Locks, and developed a General Plan (1915) for the U.W. campus. They contributed to the tradition of Collegiate Gothic with U.W.'s Suzzallo Library—T. William Booth and William H. Wilson characterize the second-story reading room as Gould's \\"most inspired\\" interior space—before taking a decidedly more modern/Deco turn with Seattle's U.S. Marine Hospital (1930–1932; later, successively, Public Health Hospital, Pacific Medical Center, and with an additional wing Amazon.com headquarters; now Pacific Tower), the Art Institute of Seattle (1931–1933, now Seattle Asian Art Museum), and shortly before Gould's death in 1939, U.W.'s Penthouse Theater (1938–1940). Terra cotta from the exterior of the Crystal Pool (B. Marcus Priteca, 1914) in Downtown Seattle, later (1944–2003) Bethel Temple, now part of the Cristalla apartment building. Glasgow-born B. Marcus Priteca, was already an Associate of the Royal College of Arts, Edinburgh (now Edinburgh College of Art) when he came to Seattle at the age of 20 for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909. By chance he met vaudeville entrepreneur Alexander Pantages; the two would have a long and fruitful partnership, with Priteca building theaters for Pantages in Seattle and elsewhere. He would eventually design \\"over 150 movie theaters including 60 of major import.\\" His Seattle Pantages (a.k.a. Palomar) Theater and office block (1913–1915, demolished) and Coliseum Theater (1914–1916, now converted to retail use) were terra cotta-covered neo-classical showpieces that set the mold for a generation of \\"movie palaces\\". He also designed Seattle's Orpheum Theater (1926–27, replaced by the south tower of The Westin Seattle), and co- designed Seattle's still-extant Paramount Theatre (1927–28). Notable theaters of his outside Seattle include the Pantages Theater (Tacoma, Washington) (1919–18) and the later Art Deco-style Pantages Theatre (Hollywood) (1929–30); his smaller Admiral Theater in West Seattle (1942) also show significant Deco influence. Besides theaters, his work included synagogues, the Longacres race track, public housing, private homes, and many other buildings, mostly in or near Seattle. His Bikur Cholim synagogue (1912–1915) in Seattle's Central District is now the Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center. Oak Manor (Frederick Anhalt, 1928) Properly speaking, Frederick Anhalt was a master builder rather than an architect, though late in life he was made an honorary member of AIA-Seattle. Arriving in Seattle in 1924 or 1925, he worked as a butcher and as a salesman before passing by way of leasing commercial buildings into construction. Originally building a wide variety of residential and commercial structures, he focused within a few years on luxury apartment buildings. When that market dried up in the Great Depression, between the mid-1930s and 1942 he built a number of speculative and custom houses, before abandoning construction for a successful nursery business. Apartments in his buildings from the late 1920s and early 1930s remain among the most sought- after in Seattle. Three—1005 E. Roy Street, 1014 E. Roy Street, and 1600 E. John Street—have Seattle Landmark status in their own right, and others are in Historic Districts. St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church (Paul Thiry, 1964–1968) Nome, Alaska-born Paul Thiry (1904–1993) traveled several times to Europe, as well as around the world in the mid-1930s. Among the first to bring European Modern architecture to the Pacific Northwest, along with partner Alban Shay he soon developed a \\"softer, more regional variant, with gently sloped roofs and natural wood siding and trim\\" that became known as the Northwest Style.. Accessed online October 17, 2017. His work ranged from private homes to military buildings and dams; among other things he was principal architect for the Century 21 Exposition (1962 Seattle World's Fair) and served at a federal level on the National Capital Planning Commission, contributing to planning and preservation for the United States Capitol. Several of his Seattle buildings were deliberately temporary (e.g. buildings for the World's Fair), proved to be short-lived (e.g. Our Lady of the Lake Church in Wedgwood, 1940–1941, outgrown and replaced in a mere 20 years;Binder on parish history, Our Lady of the Lake Church, Seattle, Washington.

Among his surviving buildings in Seattle are the KeyArena (1958–1962, originally the Seattle Center Coliseum, interior much altered), the Northeast Library (1954, later expanded), and St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church (1964–1968). University Unitarian Church (Paul Hayden Kirk, 1955–1959) Paul Hayden Kirk, another modernist and \\"the most widely published of Seattle's architects,\\" was born in Salt Lake City but moved to Seattle with his family as a child. His early work was residential and historicist; in the 1940s he began to move in the direction of the International Style and to work increasingly on religious and public buildings. By the mid-1950s, he was developing a modernist style of his own, adopting similar materials to those used by Thiry. Among his buildings in Seattle are University Unitarian Church (1955–1959), Japanese Presbyterian Church (1962–1963), the Magnolia branch of Seattle Public Library (1962–1964), and Meany Hall (1966–1974), the Odegaard Undergraduate Library (1966–1971), and the associated underground parking structure on the University of Washington main campus. Space Needle (John Graham, Jr., 1960–1962) John Graham, Jr. (1908–1991) revived the Seattle practice of his father's company in the mid-20th century. Seattle's Northgate Mall (originally Northgate Center, 1946–1950) was the first of the firm's over 70 large-scale shopping centers around the country. Outside of shopping malls, the firm's practice ran heavily to large corporate and institutional clients. Graham projects in Seattle include the brutalist headquarters of Washington Natural Gas (built 1962–1964; later used by University of Washington Medicine; Washington Natural Gas is now Puget Sound Energy); a Seattle high-rise for the Bank of California (1971–1974); the Seattle Sheraton (1978–1982); and the iconic Space Needle (1960–1962) designed jointly with Victor Steinbrueck for the Century 21 Exposition in the Googie style.Matt Novak, Googie: Architecture of the Space Age, Smithsonian magazine, June 15, 2012.

One of those, Victor Steinbrueck Park in Pike Place Market, originally Market Park (1981–1982), was renamed in his honor after his death. Russell Investments Center and Seattle Art Museum (NBBJ, completed 2006) In 1943 Seattle architects Floyd Naramore, William J.

He also designed the IBM Building (1959–1962) and the Rainier Tower (1973–1978), both in conjunction with NBBJ. Besides NBBJ, other prominent Seattle architectural firms in recent decades include Callison (acquired by Arcadis NV in 2014 and formally merged in October 2015 RTKL Associates, to form CallisonRTKL headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland); Weber Thompson; Bassetti Architects; and, bridging from architecture into landscape architecture, Jones & Jones. Callison (and now CallisonRTKL) was a large firm taking on projects around the world, with projects as far-flung as Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Shanghai, London, and Qatar, and building or remodeling over 100 shops for Seattle-based Nordstrom. Among their projects in Seattle itself are Seattle's W Hotel, and the office building 2201 Westlake. Weber Thompson, with a more local focus, employs over 70 architects in a practice involving high-rise buildings, interior design, landscape architecture, affordable housing, and sustainable design.

At least two Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning architects are represented by buildings in Seattle: Frank Gehry designed the Museum of Pop Culture (2000, originally Experience Music Project) and Rem Koolhaas designed the Seattle Central Library (2004). Residential architecture  Houses  Summarizing the styles of Seattle single-family residential architecture in 1986, Jim Stacey identified the typical houses of the inner neighborhoods as \\"Both one and two-story older frame houses, with such names as bungalow, craftsman, Tudor, Victorian, Dutch Colonial, and saltbox,\\" noting roughly from the center these give way to newer styles such as \\"rambler and split-level\\" with Cape Cods in between, both chronologically and geographically. Few homes survive from before 1900. Prior to the World War II era, homes were constructed mostly of brick or wood, with a wider variety of materials after that. Many concrete block houses were built in the 1950s. Sam DeBord lists major styles chronologically as \\"Queen Anne – Victorian, Seattle Box – Four Square, Craftsman Bungalow – Arts and Crafts, Dutch Colonial, Tudor, Cape Cod, Mid-Century, Stark 60s Modern, Split-Entry, NW Contemporary – Minimalist, Post-Modernism\\" along with recent \\"Traditional Revivals\\" and \\"Modern Hybrids\\". Seattle in the 21st century is essentially a \\"built-out\\" city: typically, to build new houses means demolishing older houses. As of 2016, Seattle builders are tearing down older homes at the average of about one a day; most are being replaced with larger homes. The most affected areas are Ballard and the Central District, followed by Crown Hill/North Greenwood, Queen Anne, Green Lake/Wallingford and Phinney Ridge/Fremont. is a modern architecture style that emerged in the 21st century following Northwest Regional style of the mid-20th century.

Apartment buildings Seattle residents in the early years of European-American settlement lived either in private houses, boarding houses, lodging houses (like boarding houses, but without the provision of meals), or generally modest residential hotels. The last of these arrangements began to evolve into apartments houses in the late 19th century, with many of the apartment buildings located near streetcar lines.James, op. cit, p. 14-15. Seattle has very few remaining 19th-century apartment buildings. Two with city landmark status are the Victorian Row Apartments, 1234 South King Street on the border of the International District and Central District and the Wayne Apartments in Belltown. Victorian Row was built in 1891 on a site near its current location, moved in 1909 during the Jackson Street Regrade, and rehabilitated 1992–1993, constitutes Seattle's only remaining structurally unaltered 19th-century apartment building. The Wayne Apartments, originally three row houses, is probably best known for the bars along Second Avenue in a 1911 extension of the building toward the street. The three two-story attached wood-frame rowhouses were constructed some time between 1888 and 1893, and were representative of \\"a once-common but now extremely rare rowhouse building form in Seattle.\\" Around 1906 the neighborhood was the subject of one of Seattle's many regrades. By 1911, the old buildings had been divided into apartments. They were raised to become the upper stories of a building with commercial buildings at street level, constituting a \\"regrade hybrid,\\" common both here in the Denny Regrade and in the regraded portions of the International District. An apartment building dating from 1903, somewhat structurally similar to the Wayne Apartments, and similarly raised in 1911 to add a commercial ground floor, stood at the northeast corner of 12th Avenue East and East Pike Street on Capitol Hill until it was demolished in 2014. Around 1910 Seattle began to see apartment buildings for a wealthier clientele. On Capitol Hill, apartments from the 1910s advertised such features as private baths, gas ranges, refrigerators, telephones, bay windows, hardwood floors, built-in cabinetry, leaded and/or beveled glass, and entry through a marble-floored lobby. The Bamberg (1910), still standing at 416 E Roy Street on Capitol Hill, was designed by architect John Corrigan for brick contractor Charles H. Bamberg. The Seattle Department of Neighborhoods notes that this building of fourteen four-room apartments, with deep eaves and recessed balconies, provides a \\"good example of the elegant materials and design used to help many apartments blend in to the areas that were primarily single family at the time they were built.\\" The Phoenix (535 20th Avenue East) even offered some apartments with ceilings. Closer to the center of town, where Olive Way curves up from downtown near present-day Interstate 5, are more modest apartment buildings such as the brick-and-clapboard Celeste (1906) at East Olive Place & Melrose,James, op. cit, p. 156-158. the Lauren Renee (1912, John Creutzer) to its immediate east,James, op. cit, p. 158. and around the corner on Bellevue Avenue the Bel Fiore (1907, Henderson Ryan) with its arched recessed entry.James, op. cit, p. 159-160. Nearby, the 6-story Biltmore (1924, Stuart & Wheatley) tried to mix economy and luxury. Most of its 125 apartments were (and are) small \\"studio apartments\\" with no separate bedroom, but some apartments were considerably larger, and the building features an elegant Tudor Gothic design, a marble and mahogany lobby, and originally included a tea room and had a full staff more typical of a luxury building.James, op. cit, p. 162-163. Further north, where the west side of Capitol Hill becomes a near-cliff with views across Lake Union to Queen Anne Hill, are view buildings such as the Ben Lomond (1910, Ellsworth Green), \\"[s]queezed onto a site that appears unbuildable,\\"James, op. cit, p. 177. with 24 large apartments, designed with a children's playhouse on the roof rather than a penthouse apartment;James, op. cit, p. 177-178. the Roundcliffe (1925, Stuart & Wheatley); and the Belroy (1931, William Bain, Sr. & Lionel Pries), as \\"bold\\" in its Art Deco design as in being a luxury building built during the Great Depression.James, op. cit, p. 174-176. After the construction of Interstate 5 in the early 1960s, numerous properties in between these two areas were redeveloped as apartment buildings with panoramic views, despite freeway noise and pollution. Victor Steinbrueck wrote in 1973, \\"The architecture of the various apartments is neither generally harmonious nor of high quality, but these do form an interesting, variegated, architectural wall above the roadways.\\" In the same era as apartments began to be built on Capitol Hill, the mansions of First Hill began to give way to duplexes, row houses, and apartment buildings, with one of the first apartment buildings being the still-extant Mission-style San Marco at 1205 Spring Street (Saunders and Lawton, completed 1905). Even older is the St. Paul (1901, Spalding & Russell) at 1302-08 Seneca Street, \\"Seattle's first multifamily dwelling to qualify as a purpose-built apartment building,\\"James, op. cit, p. 131. with three separate lobbies. Although St. Paul's eighteen spacious apartments with ceilings survive to this day, the building has lost almost all of its exterior architectural details.James, op. cit, p. 131-133. Garden apartments at 18th Avenue and E. Spruce Street, built 1924. Further east, a bit farther from the city center along the Madison Street cable car line in then-suburban Renton Hill, William P. White built the six-story Olympian Apartments (1913) on an unusual five-sided lot with views of both Lake Washington and Puget Sound. The Beaux Arts exterior made extensive use of decorative terra cotta; the building featured an elevator, dumbwaiters, a main staircase, and a separate service staircase, and was one of Seattle's first apartment buildings to feature a basement garage. Five apartments on each floor averaged . Besides a parlor and a kitchen, two of the five apartments on each floor had a bedrooms and a maid's room (vs. two bedrooms and no maid's room for the other units), though the 1920 census shows that only a few of the ostensible maid's rooms were actually used for that purpose, and several apartments housed either extended families or groups of unrelated adults.James, op. cit, p. 78-79. Puget Sound was a major shipbuilding center, and apartment construction boomed along with the rest of Seattle's economy through World War I, but with the end of the war came a downturn. Another building boom late in the 1920s brought yet more apartment buildings to First Hill. The 12-story Spring Apartments at 1223 Spring Street (built 1929) were among several designed by Earle W. Morrison. With a brick veneer, a red tile roof, and terracotta details, the building has only two apartments per floor, and a 13-room penthouse on the top floor, with terraces. The design featured fireplaces, foyers, reception rooms, tiled kitchens and baths, servants' quarters, electric clothes dryers (something of a novelty at the time) and a separate service elevator. Nearby at 1215 Seneca Street, the L-shaped Spanish Colonial Revival-style building now known as the Tuscany Apartments was built in 1928 as the Piedmont Apartment Hotel, with 30 apartments and 112 hotel rooms. In 1963 the building was purchased by the Salvation Army and operated as the Evangeline Young Women's Residence, before eventually being rehabilitated again as apartments. The hotel dining room survives and is used by the Northwest School. Its New-York-born architect Daniel Huntington practiced briefly in Denver before his distinguished career in Seattle. As City of Seattle Architect (1912-1921) he designed the Lake Union Steam Plant and at least ten fire stations and libraries. After leaving his city position, he variously practiced solo and partnered with various prominent architects, including Carl F. Gould and Arthur Loveless. This was also the era of the most prominent Frederick Anhalt buildings discussed above and of International Village, a group of apartment buildings on 17th Avenue just south of Union Street, built (and probably designed) in 1928-29 by developer-builder Samuel Anderson. Although all of the International Village buildings are three-story, 14-to-16-unit rectangular buildings with central entrances and with apartments ranging from to , their elaborate façades variously evoke Art Deco, Colonial Revival, Mediterranean Revival, French Provincial and Tudor Revival styles. Several prominent buildings of this era that are not commonly thought of as apartment buildings nonetheless contain apartments. The four-story auditorium in the Eagles Auditorium Building (Henry Bittman, 1925) was surrounded on three sides by the Senator Apartments; The Paramount Theatre (originally Seattle Theatre, 1928, B. Marcus Priteca et al.) includes the Studio Apartments, an eight-story structure on the Pine Street side, now offices but once home to numerous Seattle musicians and music teachers.James, op. cit, p. 96-99. Yesler Terrace (1941), Seattle's first public housing project. The Great Depression hit Seattle hard, and brought a slowdown in apartment construction, as in most other sectors. However, World War II brought an economic boom, centered this time on airplane manufacture at Boeing on the outskirts of the city. An influx of workers created an increased demand for working class housing. Among the projects that tried to meet this need was the Yesler Terrace public housing development near Downtown, the first project of the Seattle Housing Authority and the first racially integrated public housing project in the United States. Originally covering 22 city blocks, it had 863 dwelling units in 97 multi-family buildings, mostly low-rise garden apartments. The first portion was built before the war as low- income housing; the second, on the same general plans, as housing for defense workers and their families. Around 1960, 25 buildings with 256 units were lost to the construction of Interstate 5, and three more buildings with 25 units were lost to build a community center in 2003. A 2010 landmark nomination states, \\"Upon its completion, the project was lauded for its progressive social goals and its Modern design.\\" As of 2017, most of the original Yesler Terrace buildings have been demolished, and the area is being converted to mixed use, including mixed-income housing. There is supposed to be no net loss of low-income housing. Victor Steinbrueck, writing in 1962, criticized the \\"less-than-luxury\\" apartments then-recently developed on Capitol Hill, especially those that preceded a 1959 zoning law change. \\"At first glance, the apartments appear to be consistent with the clean, direct approach associated with contemporary architecture, but… [t]he open outside corridors… pass in front of large 'view' windows in the living rooms of the individual apartments… Most tenants close their blinds and look for another apartment when their lease runs out.\\" There were a number of notable pre-war apartment buildings elsewhere in town, such as the Wilsonian Apartments (Frank Fowler, 1923) in the University District,James, op. cit, p. 221-223. the Mission-style Friedlander/La Playa Vista (Alban Shay, 1927) at Alki,James, op. cit, p. 227-228. and numerous buildings on Queen Anne Hill. Downtown and Belltown also saw some construction of apartment buildings in the same era as First and Capitol Hills,James, op. cit, p. 86-114. but nothing next to what these two neighborhoods, along with Ballard, have seen in recent decades. At the end of 2016, the Seattle Times estimated that there would be 7,400 new apartments in the next two years just in Belltown and nearby South Lake Union, most of them priced as luxury units despite somewhat \\"cookie-cutter\\" designs. The former Fire Station 25 (built 1909) on the border of Capitol Hill and First Hill, decommissioned in 1970 and converted into 16 condominium apartments in 1980. In the 21st century, numerous apartment buildings have been built in Capitol Hill's Pike-Pine Corridor, incorporating façades from the old Auto Row buildings of the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District;Amber Elena Piona, Protecting Neighborhood Character: Pike/Pine's Conservation Overlay District, University of Washington Research Archives, 2015. Chapter 4. PDF accessed online October 21, 2017. Eugenia Woo \\"…pastiche… quotation is on p. 57. (see section Façadism below). Other conversions to apartments or condominiums in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have left the original buildings largely intact, but repurposed them as dwellings. These have included schools such as the former Queen Anne High School (built 1908, architects James Stephen & Floyd Naramore; converted 1986, Albert O. Bumgardner) and West Queen Anne School (built 1896, architects Warren Porter Skillings & James N. Corner; converted 1983-84 by Cardwell/Thomas and Associates); Fire Station No. 25 (built 1909, architects Somervell & Cote; converted 1980, Stickney – Murphy); office buildings such as the Cobb Building (built 1910, architect Howells & Stokes; converted 2006, GGLO Architecture & Interior Design) and Seaboard Building (built 1909 as the Northern Bank and Trust Company Building, architect William Doty Van Siclen; converted 2000 by NBBJ); warehouses such as the Florentine (built 1909, architects Lohman & Place; converted 1990) in Pioneer Square or the Monique Lofts (built 1913; converted 1999) on Capitol Hill; and at least one church, the First Church of Christ Scientist, now a condominium known as The Sanctuary (built 1914, architects Bebb & Mendel; converted 2010-2012 by the Runberg Group).

Floating homes Seattle has had floating homes (also known as houseboats) almost since the time of first European settlement. At one time there were over 2,500 such homes in the city, not even counting seaworthy live-aboard boats. From the first, these included floating slums of shabby shacks, but gentrified houseboats go back at least to 1888 when the Yesler Way cable car reached Leschi on Lake Washington and a string of luxury summer getaways (none of them surviving today) lined the shore from there north to Madison Park. A 1980 This Old House episode about a Seattle houseboat inspired the setting for the 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle. Seen by some as a bohemian paradise and by others as \\"lawless nests of anarchic outcasts, rowdy riff-raff, and the flotsam of society,\\" some houseboat colonies succumbed to zoning changes, public health scares, or shoreline and freeway development, while others have survived even in the face of similar pressures. , there were about 480 floating homes on Lake Union and a lesser number elsewhere in the city. Seattle's earliest floating homes were on the downtown waterfront. These were cleared out for sanitary infractions in 1908; at the time some moved to Harbor Island and the Duwamish River. In the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Harbor Island colony grew into a floating Hooverville; it was cleared out during the war, with some of the more sound structures moving to Lake Union. A few floating homes remain on the Duwamish even in the 21st century. Meanwhile, a 1907 law intended to raise money for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition forced landowners with shoreline property along Lake Union to either buy the submerged extensions of their property or lose control of them. While the landowners were hardly happy with the law, clear title led many of them to build piers and rent space for houseboats. By 1914, about 200 residences were floating on Lake Union; one was the former Hostess House from the A-Y-P Exposition, transferred to a barge, which remained on the lake into the 1960s. By 1922 the number was up to 1,100, exacerbating issues of water pollution: most of the houseboats fed their sewage directly into the lake, as did many shoreline properties. Conflicts over sanitation and occasionally building codes and aesthetics continued. By 1938 the last of the floating homes on Lake Washington were banished. The Portage Bay and Lake Union colonies were repeatedly in conflict with nearby neighborhood associations. Some were evicted due to major shoreline projects, such as a Coast and Geodetic Survey Base in 1962. In the 1920s, the houseboaters had formed their first formal association, the short-lived Houseboat and Home Protective League; this was succeeded by the Waterfront Improvement Club in 1939, also short-lived. \\"'Sprung' roof quotation is from page 72, \\"styrofoam logs\\" from page 79, Dick Wagner quote from page 133-134. In November 1962, the houseboaters finally formed a long-lived neighborhood association of their own, the Floating Homes Association, with King County deputy assessor George Neale as its first president and activist reporter Terry Pettus as its administrative secretary. That organization has now survived for over 50 years. The sanitation issues were finally settled in 1965, with the installation of the Portage Bay-Lake Union Sewer Line. In 1972, one threat to the surviving houseboats was removed when state lands commissioner, Bert Cole announced tougher policies on use of underwater lands, effectively preventing the construction of any further large apartment complexes on piers. Four years later, a city ordinance backed by Mayor Wesley Uhlman and councilman John Miller codified regulations to preserve a diverse Lake Union, including houseboats; a 1987 Shoreline Master Program declared houseboats to be a \\"preferred\\" shoreline use. Seattle's houseboats differ in numerous ways from other housing in the city. In contrast to other single- family dwellings, any parking is inevitably on shore, with the docks themselves entirely pedestrianized. Many have small sailboats or dinghies docked at their sides; some have floating gardens, including vegetable gardens. A typical 1920s houseboat was a small rectangular building, built atop a raft of logs or a former fishing barge, often with a rounded \\"'sprung' roof… constructed by… bending ships laps (notched lath) over a central beam or two and nailing them down to the side walls,\\" although those with more money and stronger aesthetic concerns opted for peaked roofs, more like the houses ashore. They ranged from tar paper-covered shacks to pleasant shingled houses. In that era, houseboats lined the shore; houseboat piers reaching out into the lake were a later development. The rafts or barges inevitably rotted over time, and replacing them was not easy. By the 1970s, the preferred flotation devices were \\"styrofoam logs\\", with a lift of 60 pounds per cubic foot (960 kg/m³). By that time, the nature of new houseboats was changing radically. Architects such as Grant Copeland began designing high-end floating homes in the 1960s; many of the newer floating homes had two stories, where as nearly all of the old ones were single-story. People began to see houseboats as investments. By 1974, Dick Wagner, president of the Floating Homes Association, was warning that Lake Union was turning into a \\"floating Bellevue\\" (alluding to a wealthy Seattle suburb). \\"The people are now interesting but rich. They used to be interesting but poor.\\" File:Lake Union houseboats near Roanoke Street, Seattle, 1953.jpg|Floating homes on the east shore of Lake Union near Roanoke Street, Seattle, 1953.

Office and retail buildings The Seattle Department of Neighborhoods describes Pioneer Square as \\"Seattle's original downtown... [r]ebuilt after the devastating \\"Great Fire\\" of 1889...characterized by late nineteenth century brick and stone buildings and one of the nation's best surviving collections of Romanesque Revival style urban architecture.\\"Pioneer Square, Seattle Department of Neighborhoods. Accessed online July 28, 2016. Since 1970, it has been listed federally as a National Historic District and a locally as a preservation district. The neighborhood was rebuilt rapidly after the fire with buildings that met the conditions of the new building code, Ordinance 1147. Construction halted almost completely after the Panic of 1893, then resumed at a rapid pace five years later as Seattle became a jumping-off point for the Klondike Gold Rush. Because the center of Seattle's downtown later shifted several blocks north, a very large number of these 1890s buildings were still intact, though run down, as the architectural conservation movement grew in the 1960s. Over the decades since, most of the district's surviving older buildings have been successfully rehabilitated. At the other end of Downtown is Pike Place Market, the oldest continually operating farmers' market in the United States and another historic district with both national and city status. A public market since 1907, after threats to its continued existence in the late 1960s it underwent major rehabilitation in the early 1970s, with a plan that centered on \\"preserving the buildings in their original form, as much as possible.\\" Quotation about \\"preserving the buildings in their original form\\" is on p. 147. As of 2017, Downtown Seattle contains all but one of the 20 tallest buildings in Washington (the nearby Space Needle being the sole exception); the vast majority are office buildings, although the office-residential-hotel Rainier Square Tower, which broke ground is slated to become the city's second-tallest building; the F5 Tower, due to be completed in 2017, will be partly a hotel; and the all-hotel Hyatt Regency Seattle under construction at 8th and Howell will also make it into the top 20. Even the Smith Tower, built in 1914 and until 1931 the tallest building west of the Mississippi River, remains taller than any building in the state outside of Seattle. Notable among the older buildings are the 15-floor Alaska Building (1904) designed by St. Louis, Missouri firm Eames and Young; the 17-floor Hoge Building (1911, Bebb and Mendel); and the aforementioned Smith Tower (1914, Gaggin & Gaggin); all of these are near the south end of the present-day downtown. The downtown core edged north with the Dexter Horton Building; completed in 1924, the 14-story building covers roughly half a city block. A few years later and a bit further north came two notable Art Deco buildings, both built on the verge of the Great Depression: the Eliel Saarinen-influenced Seattle Tower (1929, Albertson, Wilson & Richardson), originally known as the Northern Life Tower, and the 22-story Exchange Building (1930, John Graham & Associates). From the Great Depression of the 1930s well into the 1960s, Seattle added relatively few major office buildings. The drought was somewhat broken by the International Style Norton Building (1959, Bindon & Wright, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill), but the Central Business District skyline changed little until the 50-floor Seattle-First National Bank Building (now Safeco Plaza; 1969, NBBJ), 42-floor Union Bank of California Building (now simply known as 901 Fifth Avenue; 1973, John Graham & Company); and 37-floor Federal Building (now Henry M. Jackson Federal Building, 1974, John Graham & Company) the 32-floor Pacific Northwest Bell Building (now Qwest Plaza or simply 1600 Seventh, 1976, John Graham & Company); and the 41-floor Rainier Bank Tower (now Rainier Tower, 1977, NBBJ and Minoru Yamasaki). All of these were designed by architects with strong local connections: NBBJ and John Graham were both Seattle-based firms, and New-York-based Yamasaki was born, raised, and educated in Seattle. As new buildings in an already-developed city center, the construction these and others represented loss of earlier major buildings. For example, one of the buildings sacrificed for the Federal Building was Elmer H. Fisher's Richardsonian Romanesque Burke Building (1890), comparable to his surviving Pioneer Building; the Rainier Tower and adjoining Rainier Square in the Metropolitan Tract required the demolition of the Beaux-Arts White Henry Stuart Buildings (1907–1911, Howells and Stokes), built on the same general design as the surviving Cobb Building (1910).. Accessed online October 25, 2017 While it is certainly true that Seattle's Central Business District has moved steadily north, the impression of this is exaggerated by the loss of many major late 19th and early 20th century buildings in what was once the northern part of the business district and is now the center, while Pioneer Square to the south remained relatively intact. The trend toward tall office buildings continued beyond the late 1970s. The 76-story, Columbia Center (originally Columbia Seafirst Center, 1982–1985, Chester Lindsey Architects) is currently the third tallest structure on the West Coast (after the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles and the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco). Its bulk prompted a reaction in terms of height limits, zoning that favored interesting profiles, and height and density bonuses for public amenities. These strongly influenced the city's second-tallest building, the 55-story, Deco Revival 1201 Third Avenue (originally Washington Mutual Tower, 1986–1988, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and The McKinley Architects). There was then a gap of 17 years until the next major skyscraper, the Russell Investments Center (originally WaMu Center), which opened in 2006. Although the Great Recession of 2008-2012 constituted another shorter slack period, Seattle emerged from that with a record-setting construction boom. Like most American cities, Seattle has long had its share of downtown retail, including department stores and a few older- style shopping arcades. The initial commercial center was the Pioneer Square neighborhood, but by 1910 there was \\"a distinct concentration of specialty and department stores ... along Second Avenue from Marion Street to Pike Street\\"; a surviving architectural example as of 2016 is the J.A Baillargeon Building (1908) at the northeast corner of 2nd Avenue and Spring Street. At one time the strip also included the Rialto Building (1894, Skillings and Corner), original site of Frederick & Nelson; The Bon Marché (1896, 1902, 1911, Saunders and Lawton); the Arcade Building/Rhodes Store (1903); the subject Galland Building/Stone Fisher Lane Store (1906, extant but scheduled for demolition as of 2016); the Chapin Building/ McDougall and Southwick Co. (1907). The department store district eventually shifted slightly north and east. Prominent among the historic department stores are the Bon Marché flagship store (1929, now Macy's, which absorbed The Bon), Nordstrom, and Frederick & Nelson (1918, now defunct; their former flagship store is now the Nordstrom flagship store) The Bon and Frederick's flagship stores are both now official Seattle Landmarks; the Bon is also on the National Register. Surviving arcades include much of Pike Place Market, the shops at the Olympic Hotel or in Ralph Anderson's 1971–1972 remodel of the Squire-Latimer Building/Grand Central Hotel, now Grand Central on the Park. The city was a relative latecomer to modern, in-city \\"galleria\\"-style malls. The first such was Westlake Center (1988), followed by the larger Pacific Place (1998). The city has the usual complement of strip malls, as well as two major suburban- style malls. Northgate Mall, designed by John Graham, Jr., opened in 1950 as an open-air mall, one of the country's first post-war, suburban mall-type shopping centers. University Village, built on former lakebed northeast of the main campus of the University of Washington, was originally (1956) comparable to Westwood Village in West Seattle and Aurora Village north of city limits in Shoreline, Washington and like them was originally developed by Continental Inc. After a change in management, University Village was reworked to create stronger pedestrian spaces and bring in more upmarket tenants. The Seattle area's other suburban-style malls (such as Westfield Southcenter) all sit outside city limits. Seattle annexed several other towns and cities in the period 1905–1910, many of whose historic centers now constitute important commercial neighborhoods within the city. The shopping districts of Ballard and Columbia City both center on federally- and city-recognized historic districts preserving buildings many of which date back to their period as an independent town (Ballard) or city (Columbia City). The 21st century has seen a major expansion of Seattle's commercial center into South Lake Union. Previously predominantly a district of small buildings with light industrial uses, since 2000 it has become mostly a district of mid-rise office buildings. Beginning in the mid-2010s, more high-rises and residential buildings are being added to the mix. As of 2015, the district has a major presence from Amazon.com and a variety of biotech businesses. While no one architect has been strongly identified with the district, much of the construction has been driven by Vulcan, Inc., owned by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft.

Military architecture Battle of Seattle in the Yakima War. is depicted offshore. Seattle has connections to the United States military since the Battle of Seattle in 1856, and reached its present industrialized status in part as a result of World War II aircraft and shipbuilding industry. \\"Washington, a comparatively small and undeveloped state, played a disproportionately important role in the country's efforts to gear up for war...Seattle ranked as one of the top three cities in the nation in war contracts per capita\\". In addition to being a major seaport, shipyard, and industrial center with national importance, military installations such as Fort Lawton and Sand Point Naval Station and military-civilian infrastructure such as the Chittenden Locks and USCG Base Seattle, the Coast Guard District 13 headquarters, have been built in and around the city. Fort Lawton, established 1900 and closed 2011, occupied in Magnolia, on the bluffs overlooking Puget Sound to the west and Shilshole Bay to the north; approximately of that now constitutes an official historic district within Discovery Park. The buildings were designed by the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps and follow standardized plans. Among the surviving contributing structures in the historic district are six double officers' quarters and a single officers' quarters on Officer's Row (1899-1905), with garages added in the 1930s; six double NCO's quarters variously dating from 1899 into the 1930s; and various other buildings including two quartermaster stables (1902, 1908), a post exchange and gymnasium (1905) and a chapel (1942). The Lake Washington Ship Canal and Ballard Locks (a.k.a. Hiram M. Chittenden Locks), opened in 1917, were funded by Washington state but built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Administration Building for the locks was designed by prominent Seattle architects Bebb and Gould and completed 1916. The Renaissance Revival style building is a relatively early example of concrete construction, but also makes use of materials such as marble and oak; the light globes at the south entrance are supported by bronze sculptured dolphins. Under the building, in a series of basements, an extensive complex of pumps is used annually to empty the locks for cleaning. Another prominent building at the Locks is Cavanaugh House (1913), nestled in the Carl English Jr. Gardens. Originally intended as a home for an electrician to be handy to the locks, but since 1967 the official residence of the Chief Engineer of the Corps of Engineers Seattle District. It was the first completed structure of the Ship Canal project; the architect is unknown. University of Washington boathouse The University of Washington boathouse was built in 1918 by the U.S. Navy to serve as a hangar for the Aviation Training Corps, but never used it for that purpose. Instead, it served as storage for racing shells until 1949, and canoes since then. It was the first University of Washington structure to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building 26 South, Naval Station Puget Sound (Sand Point, now Magnuson Park) Conceived from the outset as an air base, the Naval Station at Sand Point in northeast Seattle, north of the Windermere neighborhood on Lake Washington, came together in several steps in the 1920s; it underwent a series of name changes and reductions from 1970 until its final closure in 1995. As with Fort Lawton, a portion is now designated as a landmark district. The landmark district includes Art Deco, Art Moderne and Colonial Revival style buildings, vernacular industrial and military buildings, and Public Works Administration and Works Progress Administration buildings. Buildings range from airplane hangars, seaplane facilities, and a torpedo shop to officers' quarters and a beach shelter. A portion of the former military facility is now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Western Regional Center; the bulk of it constitutes Magnuson Park. Much of the NCO and enlisted men's housing is now various forms of social housing. Building 29, a red brick Colonial Revival style barracks with white trim, composed of a series of linked pavilions, is currently (as of 2017) being converted by Mercy Housing Northwest under a plan by Tonkin Architects into 148 apartments for families and individuals with income between 30% and 60% of area median income. Coast Guard District 13 headquarters, Pier 36/37, from the north. Coast Guard Museum (1925) in front, then the former Pacific Steamship Company building (1925), then the warehouse (1941) that is an early example of Brutalist architecture. Although Fort Lawton and the Sand Point Naval Station have both closed and been largely converted into parks, Coast Guard District 13 headquarters (Coast Guard Base Seattle), remains on Pier 36/37. Unlike Fort Lawton and Sand Point, this was not entirely a purpose-built military facility. The main building on Pier 36 was built in 1925 for the Pacific Steamship Company, which went out of business in 1936. The federal government acquired and expanded the facility in 1940-1941 as a port of embarkation for troops shipping overseas; one building built at that time is the present-day Coast Guard Museum Northwest; another, 1561 Alaskan Way, originally the U. S. Army Terminal Warehouse, is an early example of brutalist architecture. In 1960 it became an Army Corps of Engineers district headquarters, then passed briefly to the Port of Seattle in 1965 before the Coast Guard consolidated its Seattle operations there in 1966. Admiral's House Prior to (and for some time after) the acquisition of Pier 36/37, the Coast Guard made use of Pier 91 at Smith Cove. During and after World War II, there was a Naval Supply Depot at Smith Cove and on the landfill just to its north. The facility was used by various military branches until 1970, with at least some Navy presence until 1977; most of the facility was purchased by the Port of Seattle in 1974. At its height during World War II, the Depot included of covered storage space (including several cold storage buildings), and a Naval Receiving Station also on the site included 20 enlisted men's barracks, 2 women's barracks for WAVES, mess halls, recreation halls, an indoor swimming pool, and a hospital.BOLA Architecture et. al., op. cit., p. 14 (p. 16 of the PDF) For the most part, the Smith Cove buildings were warehouses or industrial sheds.BOLA Architecture et. al., op. cit., p. 17-18 (p. 19-20 of the PDF) Except for some older (1925) buildings built by the Texas Oil Co., most were designed by the Navy's Department of Public Works, although at least one is attributed to \\"A. Smith\\" at Seattle's J.H. Bluechel Co.BOLA Architecture et. al., op. cit., p. 50 (p. 52 of the PDF) The Admiral's House on the Magnolia Bluffs overlooked the depot from West. Built in 1944, it continued as a commander's residence for some time after the Depot closed. It was closed in 2006, and was sold in 2013.The Admiral’s House - 2001 W Garfield Street, Cooper Jacobs Real Estate Group. Accessed November 14, 2017. The Washington National Guard Armory sat at the north end of Pike Place Market from 1909 until its demolition in 1968. The present-day Washington State National Guard Armory at Smith Cove is a 1973 Brutalist building of no particular architectural distinction. However, Seattle was previously home to least four prominent armory buildings, two of which survive in other uses. An armory built in 1888 on Union Street between Third and Fourth Avenues served as a temporary seat for the city government after the Great Seattle Fire the following year. From 1909 to 1968, a \\"fortress-like\\" Washington National Guard Armory sat on Western Avenue at the north end of Pike Place Market, roughly the site of present-day Victor Steinbrueck Park. It boasted a castellated parapet, round corner turrets, thick red-brown brick walls and a Romanesque- style arched stone entranceway with a wrought iron portcullis. The architect is not known. The Seattle Center Armory, built 1939, now houses a food court. A later (1939) armory at Seattle Center initially served both the National Guard (part of which continued to use the old facility) and the 146th Field Artillery. Like its predecessors, which besides military uses had been used for everything from dances to car shows, it also served as a place of entertainment—Duke Ellington played there in 1941—and served other public purposes, for example as the site of the 1948 Canwell Committee hearings in Seattle. The Streamline Moderne poured-concrete building was designed by Floyd Naramore (later a founder of NBBJ) and Arrigo M. Young. Incorporated in 1962 into the grounds of the Century 21 Exposition and later Seattle Center, with its main floor turned into a food court, it was successively known as the Food Circus (1962) and Center House (early 1970s) before becoming known again as The Armory (2012). A sub-basement, closed to the public, still contains a disused rifle range and a never-completed pool intended for use by the recruits. Dating from the same era, the former Naval Reserve Armory (1940–1942) is located on a wharf on the south shore of Lake Union. Designed by B. Marcus Priteca and William R. Grant and built by the Work Projects Administration, it is the only military building associated with either architect. Like the Army Reserve Building, it is built of concrete, with \\"restrained Art Deco and Moderne features.\\" Some strategically placed \\"porthole\\" windows help give it a nautical tone. It served as an Advanced Naval Training school during World War II. During the war, numerous barracks buildings were built nearby; all were torn down shortly after the war; some other nearby wartime buildings lasted as long as 1958. After the war, the building was used by both the United States Navy Reserve and Marine Forces Reserve. Like Seattle's several Army Reserve armories, it was used for many non-military purposes, ranging from Kiwanis meetings to garden clubs. In 1998, the land passed back to the City of Seattle, which had originally provided the site. It is now home to the Museum of History and Industry.

The current Central Library is the third on the site, preceded by a Beaux-Arts Carnegie library (built 1904–1906, demolished 1957) designed by Peter J. Weber, a German-born architect from Chicago and an International Style replacement opened 1960, with Bindon & Wright as the primary architect and Decker Christenson & Kitchin as associated architects. Six present-day public library branches (West Seattle, Green Lake, University, Queen Anne, Columbia, Fremont) are Carnegie libraries opened between 1910 and 1921; a former Carnegie library in Ballard, predating Ballard's annexation by Seattle, is now a bar and restaurant. Also from that era, Douglass-Truth, originally Yesler, was the first branch library financed by Seattle itself. After that came a hiatus in public library construction lasting more than three decades. As a result, most of the other present-day branches are Modernist buildings, including North East (Paul Thiry, 1954, altered), Magnolia (Paul Hayden Kirk, 1964, altered), and Lake City (John Morse, 1965, altered), all of which are officially designated city landmarks. Suzzallo Library (first phase completed 1926), University of Washington, designed by Bebb and Gould. There are also numerous libraries at the University of Washington, Lemieux Library at Seattle University, various other college and university libraries, and specialized libraries such as a Coast Guard library. Some of these have purpose-built buildings (such as the Collegiate Gothic building of Suzzallo Library, designed by Charles H. Bebb and Carl F. Gould; west wing 1926, south wing 1935\\"Suzzallo Library\\", University of Washington Libraries pamphlet #96 revised 2009-09.), others adapted existing buildings as libraries (such as the Washington Talking Book & Braille Library, a former Dodge dealership designed in Streamline Moderne style by the precursor firm to present-day NBBJ and built 1947-1948). Seattle's museums also present a mix of purpose-built and repurposed buildings. For the Georgetown PowerPlant Museum and the Log House Museum in West Seattle, the building itself is the museum's own main exhibit, and the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience makes similar use of portions of its home, the renovated 1910 East Kong Yick Building. The Museum of History and Industry is in a converted Naval Reserve armory; their earlier (1952) purpose-built museum in Montlake, designed by Paul Thiry was closed in 2012 and demolished to make room for an expansion of Washington State Route 520.. The Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP, originally Experience Music Project) is in a Frank Gehry-designed building at Seattle Center. Seattle Art Museum's (SAM's) downtown facility began with a building designed by Robert Venturi (completed 1991) and was expanded in 2007 into an adjacent museum-and-office building designed by Portland, Oregon architect Brad Cloepfil.. The offices were originally built for now-defunct bank Washington Mutual; as the Russell Investments center it is now the headquarters of Russell Investments; Dendreon and others also have offices there. When SAM moved downtown, they left behind their Art Moderne building in Volunteer Park (Carl F. Gould, 1933) to be used for the Seattle Asian Art Museum. The Henry Art Gallery extended its Bebb and Gould building (1927) on the University of Washington campus with a modernist auditorium and galleries (1997) by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects, which dwarfs the original building, increasing exhibition space from to . The Frye Art Museum expanded their facility on First Hill in 1997, retaining the Modernist style of Paul Thiry's 1952 building.

These two districts were designated as \\"historic\\" by the city in 1970 and 1971, respectively, and the city established what is now the Landmarks Preservation Board 1973, seven years after the federal government passed the National Historic Preservation Act. The City of Seattle grants landmark status independent of the NRHP, and has done so for over 450 buildings and structures, as well as eight historic districts. there are over 175 Seattle buildings, structures, and districts on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A given building may have either status, both or neither. Many buildings discussed and depicted in this article have NRHP or Seattle Landmark status. Any person or organization can normally begin the designation process to establish a Seattle Landmark, although if a building is rejected for landmark status then for the next five years only its owner may restart the process. If the board chooses to designate a property, a process of hearings and (potentially) appeals crafts a specific ordinance of controls and incentives, which ultimately comes before the city council to be voted on as an ordinance. For some buildings, only the exterior is a designated landmark; for others, the interior is also included. Buildings and structures that are either landmarked in their own right or that fall within city-designated historic districts require a Certificate of Approval for any exterior change, addition or modification of signs, change of paint color, changes to the public right-of-way (e.g. sidewalk displays, street lights), etc.; in some cases such a certificate is required for establishment of a different business on the premises. In exchange, they may be exempted from various zoning and open space rules, and can transfer certain development rights more freely than other buildings. Also, when a landmark property is rehabilitated, the value of those improvements goes untaxed for up to a decade. In contrast, NRHP designation does not restrict use, treatment, transfer, or disposition of private property, nor does the NRHP list properties whose owner objects. NRHP listing is mostly a matter of prestige, although there are some federal tax benefits for NRHP-listed commercial buildings.

In some cases (such as the Auto Row buildings in the Pike-Pine corridor) new buildings have received height bonuses for preserving a façade. Knute Berger wrote in 2015, \\"Façadism is not a new phenomenon, but it's booming in Seattle these days.\\" Eugenia Woo, director of preservation for Historic Seattle has remarked that \\"Façadism is NOT preservation. … The result … is often a strange hybrid building that does not meld the new and the old in a coherent manner. …[W]e get the illusion of preservation with the pastiche of the old unsuccessfully jumbled with the new. While not demolition, façadism is less preservation and more a begrudging compromise between the past and the future.\\" The Allen Institute for Brain Science Building in South Lake Union is an intermediate case between preservation and reconstruction of a façade. It incorporates elements of the Ford McKay Building (Warren H. Milner, 1922) and Pacific McKay Building (Harlan Thomas and Clyde Grainger, 1925). These buildings with Seattle Landmark status were completely torn down in 2009; 2,760 pieces of terracotta and other elements were saved for reuse in an otherwise completely new building on the same site, and were incorporated in a new structure, with modern structural walls and modern doors and windows designed to resemble the originals. The new building also largely reproduces the interior of the auto showroom on the corner of Westlake and Mercer.

Born in Detroit, Michigan, he moved with his family to California at the age of 11. He joined the Marines after high school, then pursued a college degree at the University of California Los Angeles, where he became interested in photography. A large portion of his work was about capturing images of African displacement in the West (the Americas) and its influence. He was also well known for his photography of black cowboys. Gleaton died in his home in Palo Alto, CA, on August 14, 2015 after a long battle with oral cancer. Early life and education Gleaton was born to a middle-class family. Gleaton's mother, Geraldine Woodson, a school teacher, and father, Leo, a police officer, split up when he was 11 years old. His mother then relocated his family to Los Angeles, California. He began his collegiate career at East Los Angeles Junior College where he played football. He left in 1967 to join the Marine Corps, serving one tour in Vietnam. In 1970 he returned to the U.S. and enrolled at the UCLA under the GI bill, but did not graduate. Gleaton also took classes at the University of California, Berkeley and the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena on scholarship. Gleaton earned an MFA in Fine Arts Photography from Bard College in 2002.  Career  In 1977 Gleaton left California for New York City, where he began his career with an interest in fashion photography. In 1980 he left New York and the world of fashion photography. For the next few years he traveled around Texas and Mexico, where he did a handful of manual labor jobs, including working in construction and in oil fields. In that time he also began to photograph African Americans in those areas. From this point on Gleaton made a career out of photographing black cowboys, Native Americans, African Americans, and Mexican Americans. His focus was the multicultural South-West. Gleaton was interested in the displaced, mainly Africans in the South-West. He specialized in black and white environmental portraits. Some are close-up portraits of individuals aware and unaware of the camera, some are group photos, and some landscapes of the areas that he photographed people in. The photos he captured of people were images of everyday life and not staged. Gleaton's focus was race. He found that the greatest mix of culture was in South and Central America; therefore he spent most of his time and energy there. He did face some scrutiny because of his appearance. He had light skin and green eyes. He looked different than the subjects he photographed, so some of them were uncomfortable with him photographing them. Gleaton traveled alone to the places he photographed, traveling lightly and mostly by bus. Typically he carried only his camera gear with him for the trip. After so many years of being around different cultural groups, Gleaton learned how to gain the trust of those he photographed. When he first began photographing people in the South-West and Central America, some felt uneasy about him photographing them, partly because of his appearance—including his height of 6’ 4\\", and his weight of over 300 pounds. He learned how to gain their trust, and make them comfortable enough to photograph them. He is mostly known for his traveling exhibition of photographs with the Smithsonian called Africa’s Legacy in Mexico that began in the 1990s. This exhibit contained photos such as \\"Man & Canoe\\" and \\"My Father, My Son\\". Gleaton's exhibition catalogue contained a diary entry later entitled \\"Oaxaca Diary\\", in which he wrote in 1988 about a trip he took in Mexico to photograph. In the exhibition, Gleatons photos and diary entry accompanied articles about Africans in Mexico by Martinez Montiel, Miriam Jiménez Román, and Palmer.  Late Life  On August 14, 2015, at the age of 67, Gleaton died from oral cancer in his home in Palo Alto. He is survived by his fourth wife Lisa (née Ellerbee), a teacher, whom he married in 2005.

Since the early days of the Syrian civil uprising, it was the second of its kind, following the Istanbul Meeting for Syria that had taken place on 26 April 2011. Organized by Ammar al- Qurabi's National Organization for Human Rights in Syria and financed by the wealthy Damascene Sanqar family, it led to a final statement refusing compromise or reform solutions, and to the election of a 31-member leadership. Background More than two months into the uprising, the death toll had reached 1,000. So after the April 2011 Istanbul Meeting had only resulted in a first joint declaration, a second meeting was envisioned to form a permanent committee, that was likened to the Libyan National Transitional Council. On 30 May, the eve of the conference, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad offered a general amnesty for prisoners, including those deemed to have committed \\"political crimes.\\" The opposition however rejected the offer, considering it as just another plot by the regime to gain time. Mohammad Abdullah, son of political prisoner Ali al-Abdullah and a Washington-based Syrian dissident attending the conference, stated: \\"This shows weakness on the part of the regime.” Participation The conference was attended by c. 350 representatives of the Syrian opposition from all over the world, with a vast majority of c. 300 participants coming from the Syrian diaspora. According to the observing Tharwa Foundation, the participants represented more than 68 opposition parties and groups and a dozen human rights groups. While only few prominent oppositional figures from inside Syria participated, others, including Haitham al-Maleh, gave their support through voice recordings. Participants included members of Arab tribes, the Muslim Brotherhood, Kurds, Alawites, Turkmen, Druzes, Christians, Assyrians, Yezidis, intellectuals (academician, artist, scientist), nongovernmental organizations, the representatives of prominent provinces, Leaders of the Damascus Declaration, Syrian exilees from Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and Turkey. The conference was the first one to be attended by reporters from all major global news outlets, including BBC, CNN, France 24, Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, Alhurra, the Associated Press, Reuters, AFP, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and numerous Turkish and European media outlets. Results   Final Declaration  The conference concluded with a Final Declaration that displayed a change of tone regarding the Syrian government. Calling on president Bashar al-Assad to step down and to resign immediately from all of his duties and positions, this was the first time since the beginning of the uprising that the opposition dropped its calls for reform. The final declaration consisted of the following seven demands:  Elected councils  ; Consultative Council The participants elected a follow-up Consultative Council of 31 members to coordinate all further activities supportive of the envisioned Syrian revolution. The slate-based list included 4 Kurds, 4 members of Arab tribes, 4 members of the Muslim Brotherhood, 4 supporters of the Damascus Declaration, plus 10 under 30 years-old independents and 5 over-30 years old independents and received over 200 out of some 250 votes. The elected members were as following: # Hussain Abdelhadi # Tamer al-Awam # Amr al-Azm # Amir al-Dandal # Mulham al-Droubi # Moatasim Ibrahim al-Hariri # Ahmad Fahed Ibrahim al-Hodeideen # Muhammad Murad al-Khaznawi # Nour al-Masri # Ghassan al-Mifleh # Omar al-Muqdad # Salim Abdulaziz al-Muslet # Moaz al- Sibaai # Mosab Salih al-Tahhan # Radwan Badini # Najib Ghadbian # Ahmad Riyad Ghannam # Abdurrhaman Jleilati # Muhammad Karkouti # Mohammad Mansour # Salim Monem # Wajdi Moustafa # Hamdi Othman # Ammar al-Qurabi # Muhammad Rasheed # Muhammad Sadik Sheikh Deeb # Sondos Sulaiman # Walid Sheikho # Khawla Yusuf # Radwan Ziadeh # Aksam Barakat ; Executive Council Additionally an Executive Council was elected with the following nine members: # Amr al-Azm # Mulham al- Droubi # Ahed al-Hindi # Radwan Badini # Muhammad Karkouti # Abdel Ilah Milhem # Ammar al-Qurabi # Sondos Sulaiman # Khawla Yusuf  Reactions and scholarly opinions  Burhan Ghalioun, first chairman of the later Syrian National Council, criticized the event as \\"serving foreign agendas,\\" which prompted one of the organizers, Abdulrazak Eid, to accuse Ghalioun of attempting to appease the regime. According to Swedish MENA-expert Aron Lund, the Muslim Brotherhood played \\"a central role\\" in the conference, while Kurds were \\"poorly represented\\". Paris-based political economist and publicist Samir Aita considered the Antalya conference as the turning point from an uprising for \\"freedom and dignity\\" towards a full-scale revolution. While all other opposition groups were looking to create the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change (NCB), Aita sees in the conference a first attempt of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian Democratic People's Party, main component of the Damascus Declaration body, to head out on a different path.  Aftermath  The conference was succeeded by a Muslim Brotherhood-organized follow-up meeting two days later in Brussels, and another one in Paris that was addressed by Bernard Henri Levy It however took a number of further meetings in Istanbul and Doha, before at yet another meeting on 23 August in Istanbul created a permanent transitional council in form of the Syrian National Council.

It is thought to have been sited on the left bank of the river Tiber to the south of the Campus Martius and is sometimes called the 'Navalia superiora' to distinguish it from another military port further down the Tiber near the Forum Boarium (the 'Navalia inferiora'). The structures, probably gable roofed shipsheds of the period, were also mentioned as being used to hold hostages and circus animals, perhaps during the later period where silting meant navigation on the upper Tiber had become difficult.  History  In his book, the 'History of Rome', the Livy mentions the presence of 'the docks at Rome'. These are paired with consular names that suggest dates in the middle of the fourth century BCE, the earliest mentions we have. These docks appear to have been active throughout the republican period with its greatest activity between 146-135 BCE. They were clearly important, as indicated by an expansion project in the second century BCE that attracted the talent of the Greek architect Hermodorus of Salamis - then actively involved in several high-profile buildings. The Navalia appears to have been destroyed in 44 BCE and not subsequently rebuilt.  Location  The exact location is unknown but the consensus view south of the Campus Martius is supported a passage in Plutarch mentioning the younger Cato returning from Cyprus in triumph. The text is helpfully descriptive: he is described as sailing through Rome on the Tiber, ignoring cheering crowds lining the river and not stopping before reaching 'the dockyard'. From there he parades his spoils through the Forum. This appears to imply downstream locations where he could have disembarked, either the Emporium or an earlier structure near the Forum Boarium, and supports the location for the Navalia adjacent to the Campus Martius.

In the book, Unger sets forth a theory of human nature, a philosophical view of time, nature and reality, and a proposal for changes to social and political institutions so that they best nourish the context-transcending quality that Unger sees at the core of human existence. Written in a prophetic and poetic manner that drew comparison with the work of Whitman and Emerson, and delving into issues of humankind's existential predicament in a manner that one critic found evocative of Sartre, The Self Awakened also serves as a summation of many of the core principles of Unger's work. Overview Unger opens the book by describing the predicament of human beings, who are born into a particular world and constrained by particular contexts, but also possess the ability to resist and subvert the given structures of organization and belief in which they find themselves. He asks, what should our attitude be toward these contexts—the structures and institutions that, at the same time, seem to confine us but never fully contain our ability to subvert them? The dominant response to this situation has been a set of beliefs commonly referred to as the \\"perennial philosophy\\", which holds that the world of appearance and distinction is an illusion and that true reality is a single, changeless being or divinity. Unger contends that the perennial philosophy is an unsatisfactory response to the human situation, because it rests on a denial of transformation, difference, and time, all of which he considers central to a meaningful life. The perennial philosophy calls for a diminution of intensity in life, in contrast to the life of risk and engagement that Unger advocates. Unger contends that the most fruitful and promising philosophical position for enhancing human freedom is a form of radicalized pragmatism. Rejecting the distorted pragmatism that disguises insights about humanity as insights about knowledge and being, Unger's radicalized pragmatism celebrates the primacy of the personal over the impersonal and an ethic of vulnerability over a striving for invulnerability. After setting forth his theory of humanity and arguing for radicalized pragmatism, Unger then sets forth a program for the renovation of society in the spheres of democracy, social life, religion, and philosophy, all of which he urges would be transformed for the benefit of humanity by practices of experimentalism, heightened vulnerability, and a social endowment fund that gives people the security to embrace these attitudes and practices. Key Ideas The following ideas are central to Unger's argument in The Self Awakened: * The nature of human beings as context-transcending agents: What is distinctive about the human being is his ability to outreach and subvert whatever context he is in. According to Unger, social structures, to nourish the context-transcending quality of human life, must be designed so that they are open to revision. Otherwise, the dead exercise too much control over the living. * The concept of radicalized pragmatism: Pragmatism is the most promising philosophical orientation for the radical project that Unger proposes—namely, its privileging of the personal over the impersonal, its valuing of vulnerability over invulnerability, and its definition of knowledge as whatever helps us achieve success in our projects. Unger celebrates a mindset that involves experimentation, improvisation, and risk, a way of working that looks for tools as we need them. Pragmatism in its purest form expresses that way of working and understanding. But according to Unger, the classic tradition of American pragmatism mistook an insight into human life for an insight into knowledge. He wants to \\"radicalize\\" pragmatism and return its emphasis to its central insight, which is a \\"personalist\\" philosophy. * The rejection of the perennial philosophy: The perennial philosophy is a dead- end, according to Unger, because it seeks to dim our intensity as the price of serenity. It denies the reality of time and transformation. Unger argues that our vitality is all we have, and a philosophy that seeks to diminish our vitality is, in doing so, denying us the quality most valuable to us, the quality that makes us godlike. * The time-drenched nature of the world: Nothing, Unger argues, is untouched by time. Even natural laws have a history, and may have changed during the history of the universe. * The reality of difference and transformation: For us to live with vitality and fully experience our lives as context-transcending agents, Unger argues that we must embrace the reality of difference and transformation. * The importance of experimenting with different institutional expressions of democratic ideals: Unger argues that the American expression of democratic ideals is too often distorted by an exaggerated belief in the ability of people to rise by their own efforts, without social structures in place to foster their social mobility and to provide social endowments that give them the security to take risks. Unger contends that we must experiment with social structures in an attempt to better fulfill the democratic promise. * The future: Unger argues that we need to live for the future as a way of living in the present. * American distortion of pragmatism: The American pragmatist tradition has mistaken its insight into humanity for an insight into epistemology and metaphysics. Unger wants to return pragmatism to an emphasis on the \\"personalist\\" dimension that he considers its most promising feature. He also contends that pragmatism was married to a form of institutional dogma, democratic perfectionism, that diminishes its message. * The importance of an ethic of vulnerability: To foster an ethic of vulnerability, in which people are more enabled to take risks in personal connection and as enterprising, creative agents, should be a principal task of an experimentalist democracy as Unger envisions it. * The need to reform society to make it more susceptible to transformation: Making society more susceptible to transformation would help to achieve what Unger sees as a high ideal of the kind of state he imagines: in which society is modeled on the imagination, and open to the recursive, infinite, context-transcending qualities of the human mind. * The possibility of genuine novelty: Unger contends that the tradition of the perennial philosophy, and many other philosophical perspectives, deny the possibility of genuine novelty, and they have a diminished sense of the possibility of the \\"new.\\" States of affairs, according to this diminished view, are merely penumbra of the actual, like actors waiting to come onstage. Unger, drawing upon his insight into the \\"time-drenched\\" nature of the world in which transformation is central, views genuine novelty as possible. * Mind as imagination: The imagination is the central aspect of the mind that gives human life its context-transcending power. Three tendencies in today's humanities and social sciences—rationalization, humanization, escapism—disarm the imagination. * Philosophy as a discipline devoted to expanding the range of things that can be said: Philosophy is neither super-science nor form of self-help, Unger argues; it is most effective when it adopts a third mission, which is to be a discipline devoted to unsettling, undermining, subverting, and expanding the range of things that can be said. * Troublemaking and iconoclasm: The idea that people should be free and encouraged to \\"look for trouble,\\" to be iconoclasts, because that is a way of living for the future as a certain way of living in the present. Reception Lee Smolin reviewed the book in The Times Higher Education Supplement. Smolin praised the range and ambition of Unger's book: \\"These days, few professional academics profess the ambitions of the great philosophers of the past.... One exception to this is Roberto Mangabeira Unger, whose book The Self Awakened shows him to be one of the few living philosophers whose thinking has the range of the great philosophers of the past.\\" Smolin assessed the book as \\"highly accessible to a broadly educated reader. It is written in a vivid prose style that mixes precise lawyerly argument with poetic and metaphorical passages of astounding vividness. It is a polemic and a call to action, but what it challenges us to do most of all is to experiment with how we live and think. It is many years since I found myself as inspired and provoked by a book of non-fiction.\\" Smolin concluded: \\"This is a philosophy as ambitious as any being written now.\\" Douglas McDermid, writing in the Review of Politics, described The Self Awakened as \\"penned by three Roberto Ungers: a poet-preacher, a philosopher, and a political theorist.\\" McDermid criticized The Self Awakened, saying \\"The book overreaches hugely: in a mere 256 pages (no bibliography, no notes, no quotations), Unger tells us what he thinks about metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, religion, science, economics, art, mathematics, society, education, politics, consciousness, nature, human nature, genetic engineering, life, and love ...\\" Decrying Unger's \\"paucity of careful argumentation,\\" McDermid contends that \\"his lack of engagement with opponents real or imagined gives the volume an oddly solipsistic, self-enclosed feel—ironic, given its title.\\" McDermid is sharply critical of Unger's use of the term \\"pragmatism\\" to describe his philosophy, stating that such a description does Unger a disservice: > In my opinion, it would be much more useful and illuminating to see him as a > moralist in the tradition of Emerson. Both Emerson and Unger are buoyant > optimists who preach the doctrine of “the infinitude of the private man;” > both stress the epiphanic character of ordinary experience; both wage > eloquent war against the tyranny of custom; both depict life as ceaseless > process, as change without limit or end; and both shine when they eschew > dialectic and simply speak their “latent conviction”—often in the form of > memorable and arresting apothegms. In short, the best parts of The Self > Awakened ... are, like the best of Emerson, simultaneously edifying and > provocative, perceptive and hopeful. Louis Groarke reviewed The Self Awakened in The Heythrop Journal. Groarke acknowledges that the book is \\"written with an undeniable flair and a cosmopolitan eloquence, incorporating different aspects of a socially- progressive ideology into a comprehensive metaphysics.\\" But Groarke contends that \\"[t]he knowledgeable reader will find nothing that has not been said, many times over, by other authors in more precise or compelling terms. This is not truly original work. Unger does not undertake the hard work of rigorous, objective argument.\\" Ruth Levitas considers both The Self Awakened and Democracy Realized in her article \\"Pragmatism, Utopia, and Anti-Utopia\\". Levitas writes that \\"[t]he radical potential of pragmatism is made explicit\\" in The Self Awakened. Comparing The Self Awakened to Richard Rorty's Achieving Our Country, Levitas writes that while both authors adopt a pragmatist approach to advancing progressive aims, Levitas writes that Unger distances himself from Rorty's \\"shrunken pragmatism\\" which is associated with a kind of \\"democratic perfectionism ... that effectively denies the alterability of social life, fetishizing a particular set of institutional arrangements.\\" Contrary to Rorty's \\"anti-utopian\\" perspective, Levitas writes, Unger \\"may actually be utopian in the best sense of the word.\\" Levitas also considered The Self Awakened in an essay on the legacy of May '68. She contends that the utopian energies unleashed by the events of May '68 have been \\"largely extinguished,\\" but refers to Unger's ideas in The Self Awakened as a rare contemporary manifestation of the May '68 spirit. > The quest for alternative futures needs to ... lead to politically effective > action. Roberto Unger has suggested that this action leads to a kind of > utopian pragmatism—improvisation of new institutions, new social processes, > new ways of being. Unger argues for a sense of prophetic identity, which > runs counter to contemporary politics of identity and does resonate with the > sense of ’68: we should define ourselves in terms of what we might become, > not where we came from. Martin Stone offered sharply qualified praise for The Self Awakened in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. Stone described the book as > vintage Unger: exhortative, deeply romantic, full of moral intensity, > relentlessly hopeful, marginal to professional philosophy. The work is part > essay (after Emerson or the German romantics), part sermon, part political > manifesto, and part critical theory. It is a left-romantic-existential- > political Wake-Up Call. There is an American optimism and energy about it > too. It seems more spiritually akin to Whitman or Emerson than to the > \\"Pragmatists\\" it celebrates. Stone also praised the vivid quality of Unger's writing: \\"The sound of the writing is one of Unger's signatures—the Epistle to the Romans meets the lawyer's appellate brief. And that is no accident. It's part of Unger's ambition to bring visionary modes of thought—those which are sometimes called prophetic or poetic—closer to the language of institutional rationality.\\" But Stone criticizes Unger's way of grappling with philosophical problems, arguing that his philosophical method is at odds with his message of plasticity, transcendence, and encounter: > Although its ideas are solidarity and sympathy, Unger's writing is notably > impatient and dismissive, obliterating where it should criticize or respond. > It speaks of the radical potential in personal encounter, but it overpowers > the other by netting him in the many \\"theses\\" and \\"alternative views\\" that > rigidly structure its intellectual space. Wanting plasticity and > availability to experience, it freezes and fixates .... Stone concludes that The Self Awakened is \\"[i]nspiring in the survey it offers of Western thought, as well as in its radicalization of liberal political themes,\\" but that \\"it is bound both to excite and disappoint the philosophical reader.\\" See also * Passion: An Essay on Personality * The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time * The Religion of the Future References Sources    * 2007 non-fiction books Books in political philosophy Books about democracy Critical legal studies Ethics books Contemporary philosophical literature Pragmatism English-language books Books by Roberto Mangabeira Unger ","title":"The Self Awakened"},{"id":"48715437","text":"\\"Long Way to Go\\" is a song by American singer Gwen Stefani and American rapper André 3000. The song appears as the closing track on Stefani's debut studio album, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). It was released on November 23, 2004, along with the rest of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. by Interscope Records. The track was written by both Stefani and 3000, while 3000 was the sole producer of the track. Despite being scrapped from André 3000's OutKast studio album, The Love Below (2003), Stefani and 3000 finalized a reworked version of the song to be included on the former's album. The song prominently features a sample from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in its closing outro. King is not credited for contributed lyrics to the song. Musically, \\"Long Way to Go\\" is influenced by electronic music and alternative hip hop, with partial influence from both dance music and soul music. After its release, \\"Long Way to Go\\" received scrutiny for its sample of \\"I Have a Dream\\". The song also was received negatively for its outdated metaphors on interracial relationships. However, the track did receive positive attention for being a \\"standout\\" on Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and also for its electronic production, particularly the closing of the track. Stefani performed the track during her 2005 Harajuku Lovers Tour, accompanied by the Harajuku Girls. During the rendition, digital images of people were displayed on a screen before the singer, while dancers performed minimal moves to achieve a more intimate approach.  Background and lyrics  André 3000 wrote the song with Stefani for his fifth studio album The Love Below. Production for \\"Long Way to Go\\" initially started in 2003 during recording sessions for both of Stefani and 3000's then upcoming studio albums. The original collaboration had Stefani as a featured artist, although 3000 intended for a different version of the song to make it on his album, The Love Below. The pair worked together on a slightly different version of the track, where it was then finalized and placed on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.. The original demo of the song has never been officially released to the public. Lyrically, the song discusses prejudices against interracial dating and the beauty of love. This meaning is made clear in the lyric, \\"Beauty is beauty / Whether it's black or white\\". The line, \\"When snow hits the asphalt / Cold looks and bad talk come\\" is used as a metaphor for the backlash that may occur when dating someone of the opposite race. The song also jokes that this problematic situation is \\"beyond Martin Luther\\". Throughout the closing of the track, prominent samples of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech can be heard, set to \\"unsynchronized M.I.A. like beats\\" created by a CutMaster Swiff synthesizer. Vibe described MLK's speech as having \\"made its mark on music artists\\", with some artists like Stefani having \\"lifted his word for their own tracks\\".  Critical reception  The inclusion of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in \\"Long Way to Go\\" was heavily criticized. Upon release, \\"Long Way to Go\\" received polarized reviews from critics. Some music critics heavily criticized the track for its sampling of the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, while others found it to be an interesting song. Jason Damas of PopMatters unfavorably compared the song to OutKast's \\"Spread\\" and claimed that Stefani \\"awkwardly comment[ed] on race relations and as such it's a bit of a buzzkill\\". Krissi Murison of the British magazine, NME, also was negative with her review, claiming that the track is a \\"bar the knuckle-bitingly bad duet\\", further adding that every song on Love. Angel. Music. Baby. sounds like a future hit, minus \\"Long Way to Go\\". Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork Media remained indifferent of the song as he thought that the song's lyrics \\"feel out of place on an otherwise carefree album\\" and preferred Stefani and 3000's other collaboration, \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\". However, Ryan Book of Music Times, was less critical with his review: \\"[Stefani] took a break from colorful music videos to make a statement of racial relations... the song uses a less clear sample than the other tracks, but interpolates his words into the electronic breakdown at the end of the song\\". Marc Robisch of Thought Catalog felt that \\"Long Way to Go\\" is \\"one of the most interesting out of any on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\\", further adding that the outro of the song resembles the work of M.I.A.. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was mixed with his review, stating that the song is \\"a jarring buzz kill -- and that's what's appealing about L.A.M.B., even if it is such a shallow celebration of fleeting style and outdated bling-bling culture, it can grate\\". A review from Traxionary described \\"Long Way to Go\\" as \\"a plea for interracial love–or the tolerant embrace of it–the central contention that \\"beauty\\" can be \\"black or white/yellow or green\\"\\". In an extremely positive review of the track, Mike Usinger writing for The Georgia Straight, claimed that \\"[with] a surprisingly soulful duet with Andre 3000, Stefani has come up with the kind of solo album that gets singers thinking that maybe they don't need a backing band at all,\\" referencing Stefani's time spent with No Doubt.  Live performances  Stefani included the song on the setlist for her 2005 concert tour Harajuku Lovers Tour. Archived at Jam! on December 10, 2005. \\"Long Way to Go\\" was performed alongside the Harajuku Girls, a Japanese dance troupe; the Girls performed minimal dance moves due to the intentional intimacy of the song. During the performance, the lyrics of \\"Long Way to Go\\" occasionally flashed on the screens above Stefani. Due to the topic of interracial dating prevalent in the song, Stefani was surrounded by individuals of different races throughout the performance.

It began as a program to provide care and education to African American children and later evolved into a foster care center, an unwed mothers and pre-adoption boarding home and a community day care facility. It is currently operating as a family services organization. History The building's location was authorized by the city council in 1867, and the orphanage opened two years later. Lucy Goode Brooks was instrumental in its establishment. It was incorporated in 1872 by the Society of Friends who had raised US$6,250 to erect a building on the corner of St. Paul and Charity streets. Its purpose was to provide care and education to orphaned African American children. The initial trustees were John B. Crenshaw, Jeremiah Willets, William H. Pleasants, Richard A. Ricks and Walter A. Ricks, members of the society of Friends; Rev. James H. Holmes, Nelson Vandervall, members of the First Baptist church; Joseph E. Farrar, John Adams, members of Ebenezer Baptist church; William Boyd, member of the Fifth Baptist church; Frederick Smith, -— Cooper, members of Mount Zion Baptist church; P. H. Woolfork, member of Third-street Methodist church; and Thomas M. Hewlett, member of Manchester Baptist church. By virtue of the bylaws, parents were required to yield all rights to their children and the board had discretion to bond children into indenture until their age of majority–21 years for boys and 18 years for girls. Until 1889 only white trustees served on the board; thereafter, only members of black Baptist churches from Richmond could serve as trustees. The number varied according to the financial contribution of the involved churches. In 1902, there were 22 children in attendance, seven of whom were newly admitted; one had run away, and three had died. Seventeen children were in attendance in 1914, and the officers were Rev. W. T. Johnson (president), W. P. Epps (secretary), and Alice Hughes (matron). A study conducted in 1924 in conjunction with the Child Welfare League of America determined that the orphanage was \\"vital to the city\\", yet five years later, a second study found that foster care was a more pressing need. In light of this, in 1931, the orphanage was closed and the facility was transformed into foster care agency overseen by Richmond's branch of the Children's Aid Society. In 1932 the name was changed to the Friends' Association for Colored Children and in 1938, the organization expanded to include adoption services. By 1940, in-home counseling services for children were included and in 1947 day nursery services were offered to the community. Other changes in the mid-1950s included suspension of foster care services, addition of assistance to unwed mothers, and the evolution of the center to a pre-adoption boarding home. Still later, the name was changed again to the Friends' Association for Children. It currently operates as a service organization for low to moderate- income families providing childcare and family support.

The building was constructed in 1914 to serve a Presbyterian congregation. It remained in service until 2007, when the dwindling of the congregation made it impossible to continue supporting the building as a church. It was then acquired by a local nonprofit organization, which uses it for concerts, plays, art exhibits, and other community events; it is also used for events such as weddings and funerals. The building was designed in a Romanesque Revival architectural style. Its interior was configured according to the Akron plan, a scheme for laying out Sunday-school rooms that was in widespread use through much of the final third of the 19th century. Because of its exterior and interior design, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, under the name First United Presbyterian Church. History Barnes settlement The first white settlers to occupy the Madison area were a party led by Henry Mitchell Barnes. Attracted by news that fertile prairie land was available in the Nebraska Territory, Barnes left his home in Poughkeepsie, New York; with his sons William J. Barnes and Frank W. Barnes, and his nephew Peter J. Barnes, he traveled by rail to Columbus, Nebraska in 1866. In December of that year, they investigated the area lying between Columbus and the Elkhorn River before returning to Columbus for the rest of the winter. In May 1867, the Barnes party returned north with a herd of cattle and two wagons, whose cargo included building materials for a frame house, and settled near the junction of Union and Taylor Creeks. Henry, William, and Frank Barnes each claimed a quarter-section (160 acres, or ). They built a log bridge across Union Creek, and Henry Barnes built himself a frame house, using the material that they had brought north from Columbus. During the remainder of 1867, several additional families located in and near the Union Creek settlement. Sheldon Jackson Soon after the Barnes party settled on the site, Presbyterian services were held in Henry Barnes's and other settlers' houses. In 1869, a trio of Iowa presbyteries appointed Rev. Sheldon Jackson superintendent of missions for Iowa, Nebraska, Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah; in 1870, Jackson, accompanied by Rev. J. M. Wilson of Columbus, visited Madison to organize the congregation. Services were held in Madison's schoolhouse, built earlier in 1870. 1870–1900 The Union Creek settlement continued to grow. In 1870 or 1871, the town of Madison was platted on Frank Barnes's land. Soon thereafter, the Presbyterian congregation decided to build a church. Lumber for construction was hauled some from Columbus by ox-drawn wagons; the new church was dedicated in May 1872. The church was the site of Madison's first fair, held in September 1873 and attended by 50-60 people. In 1876, it acquired Madison County's first church bell, donated by Henry Barnes. In September 1881, the church was destroyed by a tornado. After the storm, the church's bell was recovered from a building across the street. Only the church's west wall survived; on it, an American flag that had been hung for a memorial service for the recently deceased James Garfield remained undamaged. Rather than rebuilding on the site, the congregation sold the land and used the proceeds to build at a new location. The new church, dedicated in 1882, cost $2,000. In 1894, a bell tower was added to the church, and the building was rededicated. In 1897 or 1898, the congregation, which had up to that time been supported by funds from the national Board of Home Missions, elected to become self-supporting. As part of this, the congregation determined to raise $900 for the pastor's salary. 1914 church Hein's Opera House. The Presbyterian church is in the right background. By 1910, Madison's population exceeded 1,700. In about 1912, it was decided that a new Presbyterian church should be built. The 1882 church was torn down and its material salvaged: some was incorporated into the new church, and some used to build houses in eastern Madison. The new church's cornerstone was laid on November 18, 1913; while it was under construction, services were held in the lodge hall on the second floor of Hein's Opera House. Built at a cost of $26,000, the new church was dedicated on June 14, 1914, with a capacity of 200 people in the sanctuary, which could be expanded to 350 by opening the adjoining Sunday-school rooms. In the second half of the 20th century, the church's membership decreased significantly. The last regular pastor died in 1986, and was succeeded by a series of stated supplies. By 2007, the congregation had declined to nine members, four of them living in nursing homes; they concluded that they could no longer afford to maintain the church building, and held the final service in May 2007. To preserve the building, a group of Madisonites incorporated as Preservation Madison, Inc. They obtained non-profit status and secured title to the church. To maintain it and to bring it into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, they raised funds from private donations and from the city's Economic Development Fund. The group operates the church as the Historic Presbyterian Community Center, using it as a venue for weddings and funerals, and for community events such as concerts, plays, and art exhibits. Architecture The Madison church was designed according to the Akron Plan, an architectural scheme that was used widely in Sunday-school buildings in the United States between the late 1860s and the mid-1910s. Akron Plan Lewis Miller The Akron Plan was developed in response to changing Sunday-school practices. In the first part of the 19th century, the general tendency was for all pupils to learn the same lesson together in one large room. Beginning in about 1860, however, churches began implementing a new approach. All pupils learned the same lesson; but they were separated into grades, allowing each instructor to teach the lesson in a manner suitable for the age and level of development of their pupils. This practice was taken up by increasing numbers of churches; in 1872, a national convention adopted the Uniform Lesson Plan, implementing the practice nationwide. The grades were not kept separate for the entire duration of the session. The class began with devotional exercises, led by the superintendent and involving the entire body of pupils. After this, the grades were taught separately. At the end of the session, the superintendent led, and the whole body participated in, a five-minute review of the lesson followed by closing exercises. This created a challenge for ecclesiastical architects: the Sunday- school building had to be designed in such a way that the pupils could quickly and efficiently be separated into various grades, and brought together for all-school activities. One of those who addressed the design problem was Lewis Miller. A wealthy inventor and industrialist, Miller supervised a Sunday school in Canton, Ohio, and later one in Akron. When the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Akron decided to construct a new building, Miller worked with several architects to plan the Sunday-school wing. He devised a plan in which wedge-shaped classrooms were separated by partitions radiating from the direction of a central superintendent's platform. Doors on the platform-facing side of each classroom could be closed during grade-separated lessons, or opened to allow all pupils to see and hear the superintendent during school- wide exercises. The new church, following these plans, was constructed in 1866–67. Original Akron Plan The so-called Akron Plan was adopted by Protestant churches throughout the United States and the world. Many of these churches modified the design with the addition of a movable partition between the sanctuary and the Sunday-school spaces, allowing the Sunday-school classes and the main body of congregants to be separated or united. The Akron Plan's popularity declined after 1908, when an international Sunday-school convention approved the development of completely graded lesson plans. Pupils were to be kept in separate classes for the entire session; the school-wide exercises led by the superintendent were eliminated. This did away with the chief advantage of the Akron Plan, whose awkwardly shaped, imperfectly soundproofed, and often poorly lighted rooms were not well suited for any other use. To create more useful spaces, many Akron Plan interiors were remodelled; by the beginning of the 21st century, few intact Akron Plan interiors remained. Madison church The Madison Presbyterian church is located on the southeast corner of Fourth and Nebraska Streets. Architecturally, its design has been described as \\"a modest Romanesque Revival style\\". As a representative of this style, and because its interior serves as a well-preserved example of Akron plan design, the church was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Exterior The church is chiefly built out of red brick, with a belt course and a parapet of Bedford stone. Light tan brick is used for decorative patterns and embellishments. View from the southwest. The polygonal Sunday- school room is at left (west). The plan of the building is generally rectangular. A six-sided (half a dodecagon) projection on the west side houses the Sunday-school room. Two low square towers stand at the northeast and southeast corners of the building; on the east side of each, a flight of concrete steps leads to an entrance, one to the pastor's study and one to the sanctuary. A somewhat taller square bell tower stands near the southwest corner; the arched main entrance to the building is on the south side of this tower. A large round-headed window is located between the two towers on the south side, and another between the two towers on the east side. Smaller round-headed windows occur on the east and west sides of the bell tower, at about the same level as the south entrance. On the south side of the bell tower, above the doorway, is a pair of diamond-shaped windows set in a raised rectangle of light-tan brick; on the east and west sides, at the same level, are similar arrangements, but with diamond-shaped decorations of corbelled light-tan brick instead of windows. Above these are paired round-headed windows with wood louvered shutters. An octagonal cupola with clerestory windows tops the main section of the building. The roof of the polygonal Sunday-school section slopes upward, then gives way to short vertical walls defining a kind of cupola, also with clerestory windows. Interior The principal entrance, on the south side of the belltower, leads to a small vestibule from which short flights of stairs rise to the sanctuary level and descend to the basement. From the main entrance, one enters the sanctuary at the southwest corner. The room is rectangular, with a floor that slopes downward; an aisle follows this downward slope from the southwest entrance to the altar platform at the northeast corner. On either side of this aisle, curved oak pews run diagonally across the room from southeast to northwest. An Estey pipe organ stands on the north side of the altar platform; along the north wall is a small platform for the choir. A doorway at the northeast corner, behind the organ, leads to a small pastor's study. Two large stained- glass windows are located on the south and east walls. In the center of the ceiling, beneath the cupola, is a stained-glass window, lit during the day by the cupola's clerestory windows. The base of the cupola is surrounded by a circle of electric lights. View from the sanctuary, through the half-closed tambour doors, into the Sunday-school rooms Two tambour doors, each 14 feet high by 12 feet wide ( by ), divide the sanctuary from the Sunday-school rooms. The doors can be closed to separate the two spaces, or opened to unite them. The Sunday-school space is divided into wedge-shaped rooms by four- section folding doors high; these can be closed to divide the space into six classrooms, or opened to make a single open space of it. The basement contains a second Sunday-school space, laid out in the same fashion as the rooms on the upper floor. Beneath the sanctuary is a fellowship room; north of that is a kitchen. The basement also contains two restrooms, a ladies' lounge, and a closet containing the pump for the organ. A stairwell at the north end of the basement leads up to an exterior door on the north side of the building, and down to the onetime furnace room.

In computer vision, a saliency map is an image that shows each pixel's unique quality. The goal of a saliency map is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. For example, if a pixel has a high grey level or other unique color quality in a color image, that pixel's quality will show in the saliency map and in an obvious way. Saliency is a kind of image segmentation. Saliency as a segmentation problem Saliency estimation may be viewed as an instance of image segmentation. In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as superpixels). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. Example implementation First, we should calculate the distance of each pixel to the rest of pixels in the same frame: :\\\\mathrm{SALS}(I_k) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N|I_k - I_iI_i is the value of pixel i, in the range of [0,255]. The following equation is the expanded form of this equation. : SALS(Ik) = |Ik \\\\- I1+ |Ik \\\\- I2+ ... + |Ik \\\\- INWhere N is the total number of pixels in the current frame. Then we can further restructure our formula. We put the value that has same I together. : SALS(Ik) = ∑ Fn × |Ik \\\\- InWhere is the frequency of . And the value of n belongs to [0,255]. The frequencies is expressed in the form of histogram, and the computational time of histogram is time complexity. Time complexity This saliency map algorithm has time complexity. Since the computational time of histogram is time complexity which N is the number of pixel's number of a frame. Besides, the minus part and multiply part of this equation need 256 times operation. Consequently, the time complexity of this algorithm is which equals to .  Pseudocode All of the following code is pseudo matlab code. First, read Data from video sequences. for k = 2 : 1 : 13 % which means from frame 2 to 13, and in every loop K's value increase one. I = imread(currentfilename); % read current frame I1 = im2single(I); % convert double image into single(requirement of command vlslic) l = imread(previousfilename); % read previous frame I2 = im2single(l); regionSize = 10; % set the parameter of SLIC this parameter setting are the experimental result. RegionSize means the superpixel size. regularizer = 1; % set the parameter of SLIC segments1 = vl_slic(I1, regionSize, regularizer); % get the superpixel of current frame segments2 = vl_slic(I2, regionSize, regularizer); % get superpixel of the previous frame numsuppix = max(segments1(:)); % get the number of superpixel all information about superpixel is in this link regstats1 = regionprops(segments1, ’all’); regstats2 = regionprops(segments2, ’all’); % get the region characteristic based on segments1 After we read data, we do superpixel process to each frame. Spnum1 and Spnum2 represent the pixel number of current frame and previous pixel. % First, we calculate the value distance of each pixel. % This is our core code for i=1:1:spnum1 % From the first pixel to the last one. And in every loop i++ for j=1:1:spnum2 % From the first pixel to the last one. j++. previous frame centredist(i:j) = sum((center(i)-center(j))); % calculate the center distance end end Then we calculate the color distance of each pixel, this process we call it contract function. for i=1:1:spnum1 % From first pixel of current frame to the last one pixel. I ++ for j=1:1:spnum2 % From first pixel of previous frame to the last one pixel. J++ posdiff(i,j) = sum((regstats1(j).Centroid’-mupwtd(:,i))); % Calculate the color distance. end end After this two process, we will get a saliency map, and then store all of these maps into a new FileFolder.  Difference in algorithms  The major difference between function one and two is the difference of contract function. If spnum1 and spnum2 both represent the current frame's pixel number, then this contract function is for the first saliency function. If spnum1 is the current frame's pixel number and spnum2 represent the previous frame's pixel number, then this contract function is for second saliency function. If we use the second contract function which using the pixel of the same frame to get center distance to get a saliency map, then we apply this saliency function to each frame and use current frame's saliency map minus previous frame's saliency map to get a new image which is the new saliency result of the third saliency function.

Atlantic was an American garage rock/psychedelic rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota who were active 1960s. They were one of the most popular groups in the Twin Cities, but failed to break nationally. In the intervening years since their breakup, their recordings have attracted the interest of 60s music collectors and enthusiasts, and they are particularly remembered for their 1966 fuzz-tinged song, \\"Faces\\", which has been mentioned as one of the earliest garage rock songs to display psychedelic characteristics.  History  The group hailed from Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in the mid to late 1960s, they were one of the biggest groups in the Minneapolis area, recording a six singles and a live LP that were little heard outside of the region. The band's lineup consisted of Freddy Freeman on vocals and keyboards, Bob Wells on guitar, Joe Kanan on bass, and Rod Eaton on drums. Their first single, \\"I Love You So Little Girl\\" was released in 1965 on Aesop's Records. In March 1966 they followed it up with \\"Mona\\" b/w \\"My Babe.\\" Their third record was released in June on Turtle Records and featured the trance-like and psychedelic A-side \\"Faces,\\" backed with \\"Baby Please Don't Go.\\" Faces, which featured the sound of a fuzz-toned guitar and eastern scales, has been mentioned as one of the earliest garage rock songs to display psychedelic characteristics.

He was purged by Communist leader Xia Xi and executed. Biography He was born in Changsha, Hunan Province. His father was an acquaintance of Yang Changji, father of Mao Zedong's first wife Yang Kaihui. He was educated at the Yali School in Changsha (which was at the time an American-run private school). In 1919, he led a boycott of Japanese imports. He joined the Communist Party of China in February 1924, at the invitation of He Shuheng. In that same year he joined the faculty of the Changsha Normal School (now Changsha Normal University). He married Li Shuyi, who was introduced to him by Yang Kaihui. In July 1926, the armies of the Northern Expedition arrived in Hunan, and Liu was tasked to set up a provincial government. In December 1926, he was made secretary-general. On May 21, 1927, after the breakdown of relations between the Kuomintang and the communists and the start of the Chinese Civil War, Liu participated in the Mari Incident in Changsha. In July 1927, he met with He Long to prepare for the Nanchang Uprising of August 1, 1927. After the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, he fled to Hong Kong, where his English language skills enabled him to contact the Swire Group in Sai Kung.难忘恩师李淑一 He later went to Shanghai and in September 1928 to Tianjin. In 1929 he was put in charge of the communists in Hubei Province. In April 1930, he went to Honghu, a town in Hubei under communist control. In June 1931, he organized in the communist strongholds in northwestern Hubei. In August 1931, a guerrilla force was created. In January 1932, his district was brought under the jurisdiction of the Hunan-Western Hubei Soviet. Liu opposed the efforts of Xia Xi, one of the 28 Bolsheviks, to carry out a purge of the Soviets. Xia framed Liu and 1,500 other communists as being secret members of the Kuomintang's Anti- Bolshevik group. Liu was brought to Jianli County and killed.李淑一50年苦寻柳直荀死因柳直荀烈士死亡真相 Legacy Liu's widow Li Shuyi did not know of his death until 1934. He was politically rehabilitated in 1945.

Its classification is uncertain, but it most closely resembles Laevisoolithids, and like members of that oofamily, it was laid by an enantiornithine bird or small theropod. Description Tipoolithus is known from 12 small fragments of eggshell, so characteristics of the whole egg (like size and shape) are unknown. The eggshell is thin, between 0.40-0.65 mm. The continuous layer is up to twice as thick as the mammillary layer.Garcia, G., Tabuce, R., Cappetta, H., Marandat, B., Bentaleb, I., Benabdallah, A., & Vianey-Liaud, M.

It has an angusticanaliculate pore system, meaning that the pores a narrow, straight, and widely spaced on the eggshell, which is well adapted to a dry environment to prevent water loss through the eggshell.Carpenter, K. (1999) Eggs, Nests, and Baby Dinosaurs: A Look at Dinosaur Reproduction. Indiana University Press. p. 141. Tipoolithus resembles Porituberoolithus in its microstructure and thickness, and resembles Subtiliolithus in its pore system. The eggshell of T. achloujensis seems to have dispersituberculate ornamentation, i.e., covered with randomly dispersed nodes, but some fragments show alignments or clusters of nodes, though none are complete enough to determine the full structure of its ornamentation. The nodes have sharp tips. Parataxonomy Since the only known eggshells are poorly preserved, classifying Tipoolithus is difficult. It can certainly be classified into the Ornithoid-Ratite morphotype, and its similarity to Subtiliolithus suggests Laevisoolithid (Enantiornithes) affinities.

Biography Sasha was born as Aleksander Steinsapir to Jewish parents, Natan Steinsapir and Bella Meerson, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He studied electrical engineering at Warsaw Technical Institute in Poland from 1911 to 1913. In 1913, he immigrated to New York and spent a few years working briefly at the Edison Company in New Jersey. In 1917, Sasha enlisted in the United States Army, served in WWI and was honorably discharged on June 14, 1919. While in the United States Army he was granted a stay at the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) Art Training Centre in Paris after the war.Holzer, Anton. “Photo Story. Contributions to the History and Aesthetics of Photography.” Photo Story 37 (1990): 37-53. After his military discharge, Sasha lived in the Rue de Plantes, Paris, and worked as a sculptor.Holzer, Anton. “Photo Story. Contributions to the History and Aesthetics of Photography.” Photo Story 37 (1990): 37-53. In 1918, Sasha and Cami moved to Berlin together and later married in 1922.Museum of Modern Art. “Object Photo.” MOMA.org. http://www.moma.org/interactives/objectphoto/artists/24573.html (accessed October 29, 2015) When he moved to Berlin, he kept his studio in Rue de Plantes for his cousin Harry Ossip Meerson to use; however, Meerson failed to pay rent and was evicted.Holzer, Anton. “Photo Story. Contributions to the History and Aesthetics of Photography.” Photo Story 37 (1990): 37-53. In Berlin, Sasha was associated with the sculptor Aleksandr Archipenko, and was a contributor to the magazine G-Material für elementare Gestaltung. His work was published in Die Form, Das Kunstblatt, UHU, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung, Der Querschnitt, Gebrauchsgraphik, and Die Dame as well. In 1924, Sasha and Cami opened their own studio in Berlin, named Atelier Stone, meaning “Studio Stone”.Museum of Modern Art. “Object Photo.” MOMA.org. http://www.moma.org/interactives/objectphoto/artists/24573.html (accessed October 29, 2015) In 1928, he officially changed his name to Sasha Stone and became a painter. He had little success as an artist. Due to an economic downturn in Europe during this period, Sasha focused on photography as a main source of income. Sasha had become an extremely versatile photographer, working with portraits, journalism, feature images, advertising, property, fashion, and architecture photos.Holzer, Anton. “Photo Story. Contributions to the History and Aesthetics of Photography.” Photo Story 37 (1990): 37-53. His photos appeared in Adolf Behne's edition of Berlin in Bildern, and Paul Cohen–Portheim's travel guide Paris. Sasha took images for surrealist journals like Varietés in Belgium and Bilfur in Paris. His work was presented in the first international photography exhibition called Fotografie der Gegenwart in Essen, Germany, and Werkbund's exhibition Film und Foto in Stuttgart, Germany.Warren, Lynne.

In 1931, Sasha and Cami moved to Brussels, Cami's hometown, where they lived until they divorced. In 1933, the couple were part of the Exposition Internationale de la Photographie in Brussels. A collection of nudes by Sasha and Cami Stone was published in Les Femmes through the French magazine Arts et Metiers Graphique in 1933. Throughout this time Sasha was connected with artists, celebrities and intellectuals of that period.Warren, Lynne. Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography, 3-Volume Set, “Sasha Stone.” London: Routledge, 2005. (2005): 1499-500. Web. 28 Oct. 2015. Sasha and Cami divorced on February 15, 1939. They continued to work together until Sasha remarried. On April 29, 1939, Sasha Stone remarried, to Lydia Edens (born Alida Anna Edens). Sasha, Lydia and other families fled the German attack on Brussels on May 14, 1940. Their goal was to reach Spain and then go to the United States for safety. The group was en route through the Pyrénées in Perpignan, France. On August 6, 1940, Sasha died in Perpignan due to a serious ailment. The exact location of his grave is unknown.

Its dedication was celebrated on 31 March. According to TacitusAnnals, XV, 41.1, it was built by king Servius Tullius. However, the first confirmed reference to a temple to Luna dates to 182 BC and refers to one of its doors being knocked off its posts by a miraculous blast of air and shot into the back of the Temple of Ceres. That account probably places the temple at the north end of the hill, just above porta Trigemina. The temple was struck by lightning around the time of the death of Cinna, as was the temple of Ceres.

Craig Colony was situated southeast of Buffalo and south of Rochester. The facility was maintained by New York State appropriations. To be admitted to the Colony, the patient had to be a legal resident of New York State, and been declared epileptic by a physician.

They are known for their highly elongated shape. Elongatoolithids have been found in Europe, Asia, and both North and South America.Simon, D. J. (2014). \\"Giant Dinosaur (theropod) Eggs of the Oogenus Macroelongatoolithus (Elongatoolithidae) from Southeastern Idaho: Taxonomic, Paleobiogeographic, and Reproductive Implications.\\" (Doctoral dissertation, Montana State University, Bozeman). Distribution Elongatoolithids have a very broad distribution. They have been found across Asia and the US, as well as in Spain, France, and Argentina, with ages ranging from lower Cretaceous to the Paleocene. Description Elongatoolithids are, as their name suggests, highly elongated eggs; they are at least twice as long as they are wide. They vary widely in size, ranging from the 7 cm long Elongatoolithus chichengshanensis to the gigantic 60 cm Macroelongatoolithus. All known clutches are laid in concentric circles of paired eggs, sometimes in up to three superimposed layers. Elongatoolithid eggshells are made up of two layers: The inner layer, called the mammillary layer or the cone layer, is made up of radiating calcite crystals. The outer layer is distinctive for not being divided into well-defined shell units, and hence it is called the continuous layer or the cryptoprismatic layer. The boundary between the two layers is abrupt, but wavy. Typically, elongatoolithid eggs have an angusticanaliculate pore system, meaning the pores are thin, straight, and unbranching. The surface ornamentation of the eggshells is varies from scattered nodes (dispersituberculate) to linear ridges (lineartuberculate), occasionally with nodes in long irregular chains (ramotuberculate). History An elongatoolithid with embryo preserved inside The first elongatoolithid eggs were discovered in the 1920s, and were thought to belong to Protoceratops.VanStraelen V. (1925). \\"The Microstructure of the Dinosaurian Eggshells from the Cretaceous Beds of Mongolia.\\" American Museum Novitates No. 173. Oviraptor was first discovered in 1924 with a nest of elongatoolithid eggs, and it was conjectured to have been caught in the act of raiding a Protoceratops nest.Osborn, H.F. (1924) \\"Three new theropoda, protoceratops zone, central Mongolia.\\" American Museum Novitates 144. Following the discovery of Troodon eggs in 1990, their close resemblance to elongatoolithids lead Russian paleontologist Konstantin Mikhailov to believe they were actually theropod eggs, not Protoceratops eggs.Mikhailov, K. (1991) \\"Classification of fossil eggshells of amniotic vertebrates\\" Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 36(2): 193–238. In 1994, his hypothesis was confirmed when Norell et al. discovered embryonic remains of an Oviraptorosaur inside an elongatoolithid egg. It was then hypothesized that Oviraptor was in fact a brooding mother, not an egg thief.Norell, Mark A., James M. Clark, Dashzeveg Demberelyin, Barsbold Rhinchen, Luis M. Chiappe, Amy R. Davidson, Malcolm C. McKenna, Perle Altangerel, and Michael J. Novacek. (1994) \\"A theropod dinosaur embryo and the affinities of the Flaming Cliffs dinosaur eggs.\\" Science 266(5186): 779–782. Since then, several discoveries of embryos and association of adults with eggs have shown that elongatoolithids are the eggs of Oviraptorosaurs. The first oospecies formally described was \\"Oolithes\\" elongatus (Young, 1954), from China. They were thought to belong to Protoceratops or a related dinosaur because of their similarity to the supposed Protoceratops eggs found in Mongolia.Young, C. 1954. \\"Fossil reptilian eggs from Laiyang, Shantung, China.\\" Scientia Sinica 3(4):505–522 In 1975, Chinese paleontologist Zhao Zikui devised a formal classification system for fossil eggs, in which he created a new oogenus for \\"Oolithes\\" elongatus: Elongatoolithus. He classified Elongatoolithus and another new oogenus Macroolithus into a new oofamily, Elongatoolithidae.Zhao Z.K. (1975) \\"The microstructures of the dinosaurian eggshells of Nanxiong Basin, Guandong province. (1) On the classification of dinosaur eggs.\\" Vertebrata PalAsiatica 13(2):105–117 (in Chinese) The oogenus Spongioolithus, first named by Bray in 1999, was originally considered a member of Elongatoolithidae, but it is currently considered a junior synonym of the non-elongatoolithid Continuoolithus. Paleobiology Citipati parent sitting on its nest of elongatoolithid eggs Elongatoolithids are known to be the eggs of oviraptorosaurs (except for the avian Ornitholithus). Several oviraptorosaurs have been found in association with elongatoolithid eggs,Fanti F., Currie P.J., Badamgarav D. (2012) \\"New specimens of Nemegtomaia from the Baruungoyot and Nemegt Formations (Late Cretaceous) of Mongolia.\\" PLOS One 7(2). including some specimens still inside the mother.Sato T., Cheng Y.N., Wu X.C., Zelenitsky D.K., Hsiao Y.F.

(2008) \\"New oviraptorid embryos from Bugin-tsav, Nemegt Formation (Upper Cretaceous), Mongolia, with insights into their habit and growth.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 28(4):1110–1119.Cheng Y.N., Qiang J.I., Wu X.C., Shan H.Y. (2008) \\"Oviraptorosaurian eggs (Dinosauria) with embryonic skeletons discovered for the first time in China.\\" Acta Geologica Sinica 82(6): 1089–1094 Several oviraptorosaurs, like Nemegtia, Citipati, Oviraptor, and cf. Machairasaurus, have been found sitting on top of their nests.Clark, J.M., Norell, M.A., & Chiappe, L.M. (1999). \\"An oviraptorid skeleton from the Late Cretaceous of Ukhaa Tolgod, Mongolia, preserved in an avianlike brooding position over an oviraptorid nest.\\" American Museum Novitates, 3265. All of them have their arms spread out over the eggs in a bird-like posture, and the parent's body would effectively cover the entire nest. This indicates intensive parental care of the eggs. It is not certain whether the specimens found brooding are male or female, but the examined limb bones of a brooding Citipati show none of the evidence of egg-laying that would be expected if theropods took phosphorus and calcium from long bone tissues (like crocodylians) or medullary bone (like birds), suggesting it was a male. Also, the clutches were proportionally large compared to the size of the adult, which suggests a polygamous system, similar to modern paleognaths, in which multiple females contribute eggs to a single nest which is then cared for by the father.Varricchio DJ, Moore JR, Erickson GM, Norell MA, Jackson FD, Borkowski JJ. (2008) \\"Avian paternal care had dinosaur origin.\\" Science, 322(5909): 1826–1828. The eggs are laid in pairs, as shown by the discovery of two Macroolithus eggs simultaneously within the mother, and the pairing of eggs within nests. This shows that oviraptorosaurs had two functional oviducts (unlike birds, which have only one), and would produce two eggs at a time. Also, the relatively large size of the eggs indicates that a female could not lay more than one pair at a time. Parataxonomy In the basic-type and morphotype scheme for eggshell classification (which is now typically disusedZelenitsky, D. K., and Therrien, F.

It is not known exactly when Jungheungsa was established, but considering the artifacts found inside it, it appears to have been built during the Goryeo Dynasty. A bronze gong and an incense burner were found inside the temple, both bearing the written inscription “Samgaksan Jungheungsa” (Jungheungsa Temple of Samgaksan Mountain), indicating they were the temple's property. After running dating tests on the two relics, it was confirmed that the gong was made around the year 1103 A.D. (the 8th year of the reign of King Sukjong), and the incense burner around 1344 A.D. (the 5th year of the reign of King Chunghye). Thus, the dating of these artifacts suggests that the temple was built sometime in the early 12th century at the least. According to Bukhanji (Geographical Record of Bukhansanseong Fortress, 1745), Jungheungsa was a small temple measuring 30 kan (a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns), but it was later expanded to 136 kan in 1711 (the 37th year of the reign of King Sukjong), the year in which Bukhansanseong was completed. After the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592 and the Manchu Invasion of 1636, the defensive system around the capital was also expanded. The temple consisted of Daeungjeon Hall, Manseru Pavilion, Sansindang Shrine, and a stone monument bearing the inscription “Jungheungdongmun” (East Gate of Jungheungsa Temple).

Since their inception in 1994, the company has amassed over 7,000 live events, arena shows and outdoor festivals in over 100 markets around the world, including the North and South America.  History  Disco Donnie Presents’ founder and CEO James \\"Disco Donnie\\" Estopinal, Jr. first began hosting dance music parties in New Orleans in 1994 after graduating from Louisiana State University. Donnie threw parties under many different company aliases such as Moon Patrol and Freebass Society before eventually settling on Disco Productions, the precursor to Disco Donnie Presents.  Disco Productions and Freebass Society 1995-2007  Disco Donnie organized many parties under different company monikers including Disco Productions, Moon Patrol, and Freebass Society before eventually landing on Disco Donnie Presents.  Crack House Statute 1998  In September 1998 the DEA accused James \\"Disco Donnie\\" Estopinal Jr. of running drug parties and being in cahoots with drug dealers. They then offered to match Donnie's annual income if he would become an informant for them but he refused. He and the owner of the State Palace were subsequently charged under the federal \\"crack house statute\\". Passed in 1986 by Congress as a way to combat the spread of crack cocaine, the \\"crack house statute\\" made it a felony to \\"knowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance.\\" This law allowed the Justice Department to prosecute property owners of venues where \\"rave parties\\" were thrown, and the promoters who threw them. The State Palace Theatre was eventually fined $100,000 in 2001 and allowed to stay open as long as they banned drug paraphernalia like glowsticks and pacifiers.  Insomniac Events 2008-2012  Donnie partnered with Pasquale Rotella, CEO of Insomniac Events, setting their sights on strategically developing the Insomniac brand throughout the US. The pair ushered the EDC brand to core Disco markets such as Orlando, Dallas and even Donnie's current home island of Puerto Rico.

Salma then took Umama back to Mecca, where they lived for the next four years. In 629 Muhammad came to Mecca for the Minor Pilgrimage.

Ja'far ibn Abi Talib claimed Umama on the grounds that he was married to her mother’s sister. Ali said that he took priority because it had been his idea to bring Umama to Medina. Muhammad settled the quarrel in favour of Ja'far because \\"a girl cannot marry her aunt's husband.\\" Later Ali proposed that Muhammad himself should marry Umama, for \\"she is the most beautiful girl in Quraysh.\\" Muhammad replied that this would be impossible; since Hamza had been his foster-brother, Umama was counted as his niece.Bukhari 3:48:813; 5:59:553.Muslim 8:3407, 3409, 3411. Instead, Muhammad married her off to his stepson, Salama ibn Abi Salama. Muhammad used to ask Umama a cryptic question, variously translated as, \\"Have I rewarded Salama yet?\\" or, \\"Hast thou rewarded Salama yet?\\" It is said, however, that the marriage was not consummated as long as \\"he\\" lived.

Frequency Points within FS-FHSS FS- FHSS is developed to be applied in various wireless communication fields. It is innovated by GONSIN, a Chinese company. It has developed the unique FS-FHSS based on the spread spectrum communication technology. The new technology can monitor and select the undisturbed frequency band. FS-FHSS makes sure the stability of the communication. It is applied to GONSIN wireless conference system, which implements the discussion、simultaneous interpretation、voting and others comprehensive conference application functions. thumb The feature of FS-FHSS: it uses the 2.4 GHz global frequency band, it does not require certificate. The wireless frequency points are abundant, 80 frequency points could be used; 2.4 GHz has high frequency carrier, the signal diffractivity is relatively weak so that other 2.4 GHz signal could not interfere the conference signal. Adopt FS-FHSS technology, it detect the wireless environment and select the usable frequency point before the conference, during the conference, it hops between the backup frequency points, which can avoid the interference source. It utilizes the efficient digital audio encode and decode technology, one frequency point can transmit 4 channels, it just need two frequency points to transmit 8 channels simultaneous interpretation signals. Because the system occupies relatively less frequency points resource and utilizes the FS-FHSS technology to operate, it can co-work with WIFI and other 2.4 GHz system. It applies the digital audio encryption and digital modulation to avoid any interception and malicious interference; the signal transmitting power could be modified in according with the application occasion, the adjusting range is from 50 meters to 500 meters( the customized system can cover 2,000 meters). SPREAD SPECTRUM The idea of spread-spectrum radio transmission was proposed by the military who was seeking ways to prevent radio signals from being monitored or blocked by hostile parties. The two inventors came up with the notion of changing the frequency of a transmission at regular intervals faster than the enemy could retune. A special receiver that knew the frequency-hopping pattern could follow it and pick up the entire transmission. The hopping patterns were controlled by the punched holes in piano rolls became known as frequency- hopping spread spectrum(FHSS).

Springsteen and written by Rex Rienits. The film stars Wayne Morris, Yvonne Furneaux, Patrick Allen, June Ashley, Carl Jaffe and Peter Sinclair. The film, made in 1954,Bearing a 1954 copyright date was filmed in England with a mainly British cast (save for its American star) by a British subsidiary of Republic Pictures. It was released on September 29th, 1955. Only the fact that the male romantic lead's profession is not that of a private eye precludes this picture from being categorised as a traditional film noir. Its fast pace, high body- count, and thriller-genre subject matter — even the traditional romance sub- plot — all speak of the intention to make it as a B-picture noir. Plot Crime drama. 61 minutes, made in black-and-white. 1954. A criminal gang are operating a smuggling racket, bringing stolen jewellery into England across the English Channel. Gary Parker, an American from Texas, known informally as 'Tex', is skipper of a small sea-going motor launch and runs a business known as Parker Charter Service, a small operation consisting of Tex himself and a single employee, a burly (but whisky-soaked) deckhand named 'Soapy'. Tex is hired to transport a passenger named Kerrick from Dover in Kent to a French trawler in the middle of the English Channel. But Kerrick deceives him into bringing back to England a packet of stolen jewellery, which he obtains from the French boat but pretends he had forgotten to mail before departing from Dover. When Tex goes to the address on the packet, there he finds Hugo Platt, the consignee, is dead, murdered. As the police arrive, Tex escapes through the window, but Otto Dagoff - the dead man's partner - follows him back to the boatyard. Dagoff tells him the jewellery was stolen in England, smuggled to Amsterdam, re-cut, then smuggled back into England. Dagoff accuses Tex of the murder, and blackmails him into sailing the next night to meet a ship in mid- Channel, the SS Cypriota, deliver the jewels to its captain, and bring back $20,000 in American currency. The next night, Tex sets out to sea, but finds a stowaway on his boat - the supposedly dead Hugo Platt. Platt intends to murder him and scarper with the $20,000; so that, when Tex doesn't show up again, Dagoff will believe Tex has stolen his money, so will not be looking for Platt. In a fight on the motor launch, Tex is thrown overboard by Platt; but he is picked up from the sea when it grows light, by a passing French fishing boat, 'The Blue Orchid', and is landed by the fishing boat in France. The police send a man to the boat yard to interview Tex, but Soapy does not know when Tex will be returning. Later, Tex telephones Soapy from France. Soapy reports the boat was found beached off Felixstowe, and that the cops have been tipped off about the diamonds. Tex then telephones Dagoff, and speaks to his assistant, Kitty. He warns her about Platt, expecting her to tell Dagoff; but unknown to him, Kitty is in cahoots with Platt. In France, Tex falls in love with Jacqueline, the beautiful sister of Jean-Pierre, the skipper of the 'Blue Orchid'. And Tex finds the smuggler, Kerrick, on the 'Blue Orchid', attempting to play the same game with Jean-Pierre that he had used to deceive Tex. There is a fight, but Kerrick gets the drop on Tex. Tex nevertheless warns Kerrick that Hugo Platt is still alive and has tried to kill him, and that it is Hugo who has stolen the money. Kerrick reports to Dagoff that Tex is still alive in France, at Port Solaire. A man comes to Port Solaire and shoots Tex, but he survives, and embarks on the 'Blue Orchid' for England. Jacqueline extracts the bullet, and nurses Tex on the voyage to England - which is quite lengthy due to the fishing which is done en route. Kerrick now blackmails Hugo into giving him half of the stolen money - ten thousand dollars. But Hugo kills him instead, to avoid doing so. Tex returns to Dover, and Soapy mentions that Kitty had called by with Hugo, and that they had tried to extort information from Soapy of Tex's whereabouts - information he didn't have. Tex realises that Kitty never passed on the phone message he gave her. Hugo and Kitty make plans to flee together, to get clear of Dagoff. Soapy and Tex try to find Kerrick, but at his rooms they find Detective Sgt Burroughs instead, called in to investigate Kerrick's murder. Tex nearly gets arrested, but Soapy locks the door to the apartment as they run for it, so that the police can't follow. Tex now goes to see Dagoff, to clear himself of suspicion. He knows he can call on the Captain of the SS Cypriota to identify Hugo as the man who was given the $20,000. But Kitty and Hugo intervene, and Hugo callously shoots Dagoff. In the ensuing fight between Hugo, Tex and Soapy, Kitty accidentally shoots and kills Hugo. Finally, Tex is reunited in France with Jacqueline.

He was a defender and associate of the Tuscan artists the Macchiaioli, whom he often hosted at his estate in Castiglioncello. Martelli was born in Florence, the son of a road engineer.Boime 1993, p. 228. He studied natural sciences at the University of Pisa.Broude 1987, p. 269. In 1855, while still in his teens, he became acquainted with the group of artists who frequented the Caffè Michelangiolo in Florence who would become known as the Macchiaioli. In 1859 Martelli fought in the Second Italian War of Independence.Broude 1987, p. 62. In 1861 he inherited a large estate around Castiglioncello on a hill overlooking a cliff. Castiglioncello at the time was a small village of fishermen and farmers, as evidenced in the numerous paintings of the movement. Martelli's home there became a haven where his artist friends could work from nature,Broude 1987, p. 100. and he became an advocate and theoretician of the Macchiaioli. His writing on art in the 1860s championed the realism of artists such as Courbet and the Barbizon School.Broude 1987, p. 270. In 1862–63 he made his first visit to Paris, where he attended the Salon des Refuses. He encountered the work of Manet, which he disparaged as \\"ugly\\" and \\"ostentatious\\". He traveled to Paris again in 1869. During his third trip to the French capital in 1870 he attended lectures on organic chemistry by Michel Eugène Chevreul, whose color theories were of great interest to Martelli.Calingaert 1988. With Adriano Cecioni and Telemaco Signorini he founded the journal Gazzettino delle arti del disegno in 1867, and in 1873 he initiated the art journal Giornale artistico. In the mid-1870s, letters he received from his friend Federico Zandomeneghi, who had relocated to Paris in 1874, stimulated Martelli's curiosity about the Impressionists. His fourth and longest sojourn in Paris was from April 1878 to April 1879.Baumann et al. 1994, p. 268. The articles he wrote for various Italian journals during his stay reveal his developing interest in the formal and optical qualities of Impressionism, which supplanted his earlier enthusiasm for art that emphasized rural values and social concerns as exemplified by Millet.Broude 1987, pp. 271–272. He spent time with Manet, and with Degas who painted two portraits of him in 1879.Broude 1987, p. 272. Martelli's closest friendship among the Impressionists was with Pissarro who, at Martelli's urging, exhibited two of his paintings in the Florence Promotrice of 1879. That they were poorly received, even by the Macchiaioli, was a disappointment to Martelli.Broude 1987, p. 274. Martelli continued to champion new art. In a lecture he delivered in Venice in 1895, he praised the Neo-Impressionists, who \\"on the basis of the theories of light and color combinations, scientifically explained by the chemist Chevreul, ... carry out experiments that today are ridiculed but that will probably be the triumphs of tomorrow.\\" Martelli died in Florence on November 20, 1896.

The O in the title is also a peace symbol. Other San Diego underground newspapers that dealt with similar issues include the San Diego Free Press and The San Diego Door. The original staff was a small collection of activists who lived in a collective house on Etiwanda St in Northeast Ocean Beach. Most of the original group were recent graduates of the University of California and veterans of the anti-war movement expressing Vietnam War opposition. The collective published Volume 1 Number 1 in September 1970. A major early issue for the OB Rag was the fight to save Collier Park on land that had been donated to the City by David Charles Collier. A riot in Collier Park on March 28, 1971 was covered in detail by the Rag. Beginning in 1972 OB Rag staff and local radical worked from 'The Red House' on 5113 Cape May. The house was the target of paramilitary vigilantes calling themselves the Secret Army Organization (SAO) who allegedly fired shots into the house. The OB Rag was subjected to arrests by local police, and harassment and spying by the FBI. Shots were fired into an activist house at 2014 1/2 Abbott St in Ocean Beach, by the San Diego Police.  Revival  The OB Rag was revived twenty-six years later with paper editions published in Ocean Beach between 2001 and 2003 by members of the Ocean Beach Grassroots Organization (OBGO). The OB Rag has been online at OBRag.org since 2007. In June 2011 members of the OB Rag helped relaunch the San Diego Free Press as an online publication. References External links *OB Rag archives.

Its vision is to reduce global warming and implement reforestation programs. The motto of the organization is to propagate a culture of planting and protecting trees and make it part of our day to day activity rather than a ritualistic and symbolic process. History Greenvein's first meeting was held at Ernakulam on 6 May 2014. In this meeting a decision was made to plant and protect One Billion Trees across India within 21 years. . In order to fulfil the aim, widespread campaigns were initiated. Within a year Greenvein made its presence in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Odisha. On June 5, 2014, World Environment Day, 32,200 saplings were planted in Kerala alone with the support of Ministry of Forest. On the same day saplings were planted in Dehradun, Capital city of Uttarakhand state, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Delhi, Redegg Infopark at Nagarcoil, Tamil Nadu , Niv Vidya Mandir at Greater Noida, and Navaprabhat Gurukulam , Navupauli village, Odisha. Activities 2014, Greenvein started nurseries at Haridwar, Rudraprayag, Noida and Odisha with the help of common people. In Kerala, 10 nurseries were started. In addition to this, Greenvein volunteers maintain many more small nurseries with the capacity to rear 100 saplings to 300 saplings at their homes or surroundings. These nurseries produce approximately 300, 000 saplings per year. And in various states, Greenvein has planted 600, 000 saplings within 2015. On June 5, 2015, Greenvein conducted a seed distribution campaign and distributed approximately 150, 000 seeds on that day. The project is called one billion tree project. Tree Trip Tree Trip is a campaign in the leadership of Swami Samvidanand, Chief Coordinator of Greenvein to create awareness on the necessity of planting and protecting trees and to plant seeds and saplings in every single district of India . This \\" Himalaya to Kanyakumari\\" Tree Trip started from Himalaya on 7 May 2015. Swami Samvidanand leads this journey in a Maruti Alto car. The trip associates with bodies such as Environmental and Ecological organizations, Eco Clubs of Schools and Colleges , Women Empowerment Institutions and Cultural Societies in each State. The activities of Tree Trip includes distribution of seeds, conducting awareness seminars for school and college students and the native people on the importance of environment conservation and tree planting in this era of Global warming.

It was released on February 18, 2016, in Japan. On April 7, Koei Tecmo announced a Western release in North America and Europe for August 2016. Microsoft Windows and Xbox One versions were also revealed. On March 20, 2018, Attack on Titan 2, the game's sequel, was released worldwide. Plot The game retells key moments from the Attack on Titan manga (chapters 1 through 33), which are also covered by the first season of the anime series, in addition to new scenarios involving the key characters. In 845, when Eren was just 10 years old, the \\"Colossal Titan\\" suddenly appeared. Large enough to breach the Wall, it allowed other Titans to rampage through the city. One of them ate Carla, Eren's mother. With the so-called \\"Armored Titan\\" now preventing access, Wall Maria was abandoned and humanity were forced to fall back to Wall Rose. Having lost his family, his home and his dreams, Eren swore revenge on the Titans. Aiming to become a member of the Scout Regiment, he joined the \\"104th Cadet Corps.\\" Five years after Eren enlisted, the \\"Colossal Titan\\" suddenly appeared again. Eren tried to fight it alone but failed to defeat it. He returned to headquarters and then takes a squad out himself, but the mission was a failure with Eren suffering a terrible injury to his leg and many soldiers being killed. When Armin was about to be eaten by a Titan, Eren sacrifices his life to save him. Immediately before the Trost District Wall was destroyed by the Colossal Titan, elite members of the Scout Regiment were on a mission outside the Wall. The principal role of the Scout Regiment was to scout beyond the Wall, seeking a way to take back Wall Maria which was lost 5 years previously. Setting up supply bases in destroyed towns and villages, they sought to secure a route for a large force to make their way to the Shiganshina District, where the Wall was destroyed. Fighting with the Titans outside the wall as they go, they sought to secure the route while making new discoveries along the way. The brave resistance offered by the Garrison Regiment, combined with the return of the Scout Regiment, was enough to keep Wall Rose safe from the Titans. Within the Walls, however, the same chaos descended as was experienced when Wall Maria was lost 5 years previously. Not only has the Colossal Titan attacked humanity again, but the damaged Wall has been repaired - unbelievably - by the \\"power of the Titans.\\" Is Eren an ally for humanity or just another enemy? As the debate continues within the Walls, the Scout Regiment - newly joined by Eren - begin their 57th mission to the outside world. Gameplay The game's visuals matches that of the anime series and it features one player fighting multiple enemies. The 3D Maneuvering Gear can be used to ascend to high areas. Characters The game features ten playable characters. Initially, only three can be selected. But as players progress through Attack (story) mode, more characters are unlocked. * Eren Yeager * Mikasa Ackerman * Armin Arlert * Jean Kirschtein * Connie Springer * Sasha Braus * Krista Lenz * Levi * Zoë Hange * Erwin Smith Development The game was published by Koei Tecmo and developed by Omega Force, and was first announced at Gamescom. A new trailer was unveiled on November 6, 2015, in addition to details about the Collector's Edition. It was released for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita in Japan.

Early life and family Born in 1948, Williams was the daughter of Mary Williams (née Thorpe) and her husband mathematician and public servant Robin Williams. Williams attended Wellington Girls' College, and, in 1966, moved to Dunedin to study an arts degree in English literature at the University of Otago, where her father was appointed vice-chancellor the following year. Career Williams' publishing career began when she and her husband were living in Oxford, England, while her husband, economist Geoff Bertram, studied for a PhD. Williams found work as a research assistant for Professor Helen Gardner, working on editing The New Oxford Book of English Verse, and for Professor Richard Ellmann, a biographer. These connections led on to work as an editor at Oxford University Press (OUP). When Williams returned to New Zealand in 1976, she continued to work for OUP, collaborating with W. H. Oliver on the Oxford History of New Zealand, the first general history of New Zealand to have been published in over 20 years. In 1981 Williams left OUP to start her own independent company, Port Nicholson Press, which she founded with Roy Parsons and Lindsey Missen. Four years later Williams sold the company to Allen & Unwin (Australia) and became managing director of Allen & Unwin (New Zealand). Two of her major projects while at Allen & Unwin went on to win the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Award: the multi- volume Dictionary of New Zealand Biography; and Claudia Orange's The Treaty of Waitangi. In 1990 she founded Bridget Williams Books, focusing on non-fiction books on New Zealand history, women's history, Māori history and contemporary topics. The company is recognised for making a significant contribution to the body of New Zealand historical work. Notable publications include The Book of New Zealand Women and the first general history of Māori, Tangata Whenua: An Illustrated History. In 1997, The Story of Suzanne Aubert won Book of the Year at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards. In 2010, Encircled Lands: Te Urewera 1820–1921 won the NZ Post Book of the Year Award. From 1995 to 1998, Williams published under a joint imprint with Auckland University Press. Williams has also been active in publishing events and organisations. She was a founding member of the Listener Women's Book Festival, and involved in both the Independent Publishers network and the Publishers' Association of New Zealand. Recognition In 1982, Williams was awarded a Winston Churchill Fellowship. In the 1996 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to book publishing, and in the 2012 Queen's Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours she was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to publishing.

Shmukler was a mechanical engineer and worked all his life in the construction and mounting trust No. 86 as a chief mechanic. His mother, Shklovskaya Asya Abramovna was a chemist and the head of the laboratory at the pharmaceutical institute. In 1964 he entered the Kharkiv Institute of Civil Engineering (now – Kharkiv National University of Building and Architecture) on faculty «Industrial and Civil Engineering», from which he graduated in 1969. After graduating in civil engineering from 1969 to 1986, he worked in the «Kharkovproekt» consistently occupying positions from the engineer to the chief of the department, and from 1986 to 1990 – in the «Ukrgorstroyproekt», where he occupied positions from the head of technical department to the deputy chief engineer of the institute. In 1977 he defended the PhD thesis, and in 1997 – thesis for the degree of the doctor of technical sciences. Since 1990 Shmukler has been working in O. M. Beketov National University of Urban Economy (ex – Kharkiv National Academy of Municipal Economy), consistently occupying positions: the professor of building structures, and since 2012 – the chief of building structures department.  Work in state design institutes  After graduating from the Kharkiv Institute of Civil Engineering (now – Kharkiv National University of Building and Architecture), Shmukler from 1969 to 1990 worked in the research and design institutes, «Kharkovproekt» (1969–1986), «Ukrgorstroyproekt» (1986–1990), where he occupied the positions from the head of the technical department to the deputy chief engineer of the institute. In «Kharkovproekt» period, he created one of the first in Ukraine the computation center and computer-aided design of industrial and civil structures. Under his leadership and with direct participation a number of CAD software systems were created. The results of these developments were the basis of his dissertation for the degree of candidate of technical sciences «Research work flat concrete casings». The work suggested and developed new methods of accounting for physical and geometrical nonlinearities in solving the problems of static stability of membranes covering. Also, in these years, Shmukler co-authored a series of CJC (Complex Kharkiv Series) for the construction of large sixteen-residential buildings and was one of the organizers of a network of data centers roses State Construction Committee of Ukraine. Over the years of work in the GUI «Ukrgorstroyproekt», Shmukler was one of the pioneers in the creation and development of youth and housing construction in Ukraine. After the earthquake in Armenia he took an active part in the reconstruction of housing, that had welfare and cultural purposes. He was one of the first engaged in the implementation of the industrial facilities of reinforced concrete and metal spatial structures in buildings and structures of the country.  Scientific activity  Shmukler's scientific interests are associated with the theory of structural systems, information technology for calculation and design of structures, methods of their optimization and rationalization. His main works in this area include: integrated gradient method for finding the global extremum of functionals on many variables; method for solving multiobjective optimization problems; overdetermined contour collocation method for solving boundary problems in the theory of plates and shells; compilation methods for solving nonlinear problems of the theory of constructions. A cycle of his work devoted to the creation of direct design methods, well-founded principles of new energy, is the basis of the formation of constructions with a simple external and complex internal geometry. Based on them, the following were created and implemented: architectural construction systems RAMPA, IKAR, DOBOL, intended for housing and civil engineering; a family of gantry and bridge cranes up to 800 tons, etc. Architectural construction system RAMPA (abbreviation: panel frame) is an alternative to panel housing and is intended for the design and construction of five to six story residential buildings, hotel complexes, facilities of social and cultural purpose, health protection facilities, three to four story garage parking for automobile motor transport, cottages, health resorts and other facilities of housing and civil purposes. It was built on the principle of the organic compound of the best qualities of carcass and frameless systems (Fig. 1). The basis of the architectural and construction system RAMPA is a catalogue of its products made of precast reinforced concrete. At the same time, the catalogue has a limited set of elements that generate an infinitely large variability of their combination into dimensional compositions. These elements include flat panel frames and floor panels. Panels of slab together with the frames are the basic framework elements, which are being built according to the principle of children's erector set. Four orthogonally jointed frames and two panels of slab create a «cube», which allows free jointing with other structural cells. A cellular regular or irregular, but nevertheless, fractal structure resulting from joining of the «cubes», is in some sense similar to the bionic carrier frames. At the same time, the use of conventional or lightweight reinforced concrete is limited only by bearing elements. The main size of panel frames – 3.6х3.3(h) m, panels of slab – 3.6х3.6 m, 1.8х7.2 m. The weight of panel frames does not exceed 800 kg, weight of panels of slab has a weight of 2 to 3.5 t. RAMPA system is a problem-oriented system, i.e. a system having a clear applied focus (Fig. 2). {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} 1 – reinforced concrete frames, 2 – metal junction element (conductor), 3 – frame posts, 4 – composite column, 5 – panels of slab, 6 – framework beams, 13 – jut frame, 14 – console panel frame In 1995, Shmukler was awarded the title of laureate of the State Prize of Ukraine in the field of architecture for the development, research and introduction of a new architectural and construction system RAMPA for housing and civil engineering. In 1997, Shmukler defended his doctoral dissertation on the topic: «Dimensional reinforced concrete frame systems of multi-criteria compliance». Within the scope of this thesis he defended 37 scientific papers and 24 patents, being the scientific basis of solving the problem of creation of a system of buildings in compliance with modern conditions with maximum use of the existing base of construction industry. The methodology proposed is the result of a specially constructed modification of the theory of direct structural design, which includes mathematical modeling of these systems, rationalization of their parameters while regulating stress- strain state. On the basis of the approach problem-oriented architectural and construction systems of residential and public buildings distinguished by high competitiveness were created. A wide range of theoretical research designs were carried out, which resulted in the creation of methods, algorithms and programs to solve complex problems in the theory of non-linear structures, allowing to minimize the processing time. The program products included in calculating complex MIRAZH were developed. The theoretical results were tested by setting up field experiments on structures with optimized parameters. Carrying out experiments became possible with adapting and refining the technical and program means of the automated system of scientific achievements. Industrial introduction of the proposed structures, methods of their design, production, transportation and installation, providing substantial saving of resources was carried out. Environmental and economic characteristics of the installations were improved (Fig. A, B, C, D, E, F, G). {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} Fig. B.

The character of destruction of column joints in the tests: {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} On the basis of Shmukler's scientific papers, the following was created and implemented: noise and vibration damping system for mobile power stations, functioning on the basis of secondary use of aircraft jet engines; chambers for welding in high vacuum; dimensional metallic and composite structures of slabs and covers, etc. (Fig. 3, 4). {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} Shmukler is the author of the hydraulic method of experimental study of designs. This method is widely used for field, laboratory acceptance testing of designs, both for those constructed and in the process of construction (Fig. 5). {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} Shmukler participated in the design and construction of unique facilities, such as: library complex of the NTU «KhPI» (Kharkiv); reconstruction of the ground control complex of the national satellite communication system in Crimea; complex of 28-story residential buildings in Kharkiv; logistics center «Maxus»; entertainment complex «Misto»; exposition center in Constitution Square in Kharkiv, large span constructions of civil and industrial structures; multi-storey structures made of reinforced concrete with a wide grid of columns (Fig.6). {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} He took part in the reconstruction of architectural monuments of the constructionism period: the 52nd liaison office (Kharkiv); the building of Gosprom (Kharkiv), etc. Research and development activities, which are conducted under the direction of Shmukler, dedicated to the restoration of buildings and structures affected by man-made disasters, are the practical basis of the full range of works in the conditions of force majeure (Fig. 7). {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} {|align=\\"center\\" |-valign=\\"top\\"  |} In 1999, he was elected as the member of the Ukrainian Academy of Construction. Shmukler's scientific achievements were marked with state awards: for the organization, implementation and development of the youth construction in Ukraine – 40 Years of Youth Residential Complex Movement Medal (2011); for his outstanding contribution to the development of science, technology and engineering in Ukraine – Silver Medal of the Academy of Construction of Ukraine (2013) and Gold Medal of A.

There is some dispute about the toxicity of CRM197, with evidence that it is toxic to yeast cells and some mammalian cell lines.  Description  CRM197 is a genetically detoxified form of diphtheria toxin. A single mutation at position 52, substituting glutamic acid for glycine, causes the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the native toxin to be lost. The structural basis for the lack of CRM197 toxicity has recently been elucidated.Malito, Structural basis for lack of toxicity of the diphtheria toxin mutant CRM197, PNAS 109: 5229, 2012 CRM197 is widely used as a carrier protein for conjugate vaccines. A potential advantage of CRM197 over toxoided proteins is that, because it is genetically detoxified, it retains its full complement of lysine amines for conjugation. There is also evidence suggesting that, compared with tetanus toxoid, there is less carrier-induced suppression of the immune response, especially when there are many individual polysaccharides linked to the same carrier protein. A summary of the uses and properties of CRM197 has been published. CRM197, like diphtheria toxin, is a single polypeptide chain of 535 amino acids (58.4 kD) consisting of two subunits (linked by disulfide bridges).  Manufacturing  The gene for CRM197 has been cloned into Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the bacteria that produces the native toxin.Rappuoli R., Isolation and characterization of Corynebacterium diphtheriae nontandem double lysogens hyperproducing CRM197., Appl Environ Microbiol. 46:560, 1983 Like the wild type toxin, CRM197 is expressed as a secreted protein at relatively low yields (typically <100 mg/L). Corynebacterium expressed CRM197 is available from several sources, including List Laboratories and SigmaAldrich. The low yield and high cost of commercially available native CRM197 has led to efforts to produce CRM197 in other bacteria but this has proven a difficult task until recently. Three companies have succeeded at manufacturing CRM197 as a recombinant protein. Pfenex, a San Diego-based developer of biosimilar therapeutics,NYSE MKT: PFNX produces the protein in India at Serum Institute of India Pune using Pseudomonas fluorescens and various proprietary expression technologies for high yield. Fina BioSolutions LLC of Rockville, Maryland has achieved multi-gram/L expression of CRM197 in E. coli (“EcoCRMTM”) as an intracellular, properly folded soluble protein. Fina Biosolutions currently provides the protein for pre-clinical use. Recombinant CRM197 is also made in low-mutation Clean Genome® E. coli by Scarab Genomics LLC where transport of CRM197 into the bacterial cell periplasm enhances its stability and proper folding.  Uses  CRM197 is used as a carrier protein in a number of approved conjugate vaccines. HibtiterTM, a vaccine to protect against Haemophius influenzae type b, approved by the FDA in 1990, was the first conjugate vaccine to use CRM197 (the vaccine was discontinued in 2007). Pfizer's Prevnar, which in 2000 became the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to gain FDA approval, comprises polysaccharides from pneumococcal serotypes conjugated to CRM197.A larger number of clinical and pre-clinical conjugate vaccines using CRM197 as the carrier protein are being evaluated. A further example of a vaccine currently in use that is a CRM197 conjugate is the meningitis ACWY vaccine, Menveo, produced by GlaxoSmithKline. CRM197 possess a binding site for EGF receptor heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the EGF family.Mitamura, et al. Diphtheria Toxin Binds to the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-like Domain of Human Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor/Diphtheria Toxin Receptor and Inhibits Specifically Its Mitogenic Activity, The J. Bio Chem, 270, 1995 As this receptor is overexpressed on cancer cells, there have been efforts to use CRM197 as an anti-cancer therapy.Buzzi, et al. CRM197 (nontoxic diphtheria toxin): effects on advanced cancer patients., Cancer Immunol Immunother. 53:1041, 2004.; Dateoka, S. et al., Effects of CRM197, a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, in oral cancer., 45:91, 2012 The cancer immunotherapy company Imugene reported dramatic improvements in antibody titers from its B cell peptide cancer immunotherapy targeting HER2 when it used CRM197 as a carrier protein.[5] CRM197 is being evaluated as a potential drug delivery fusion protein. The Swiss-based Turing Pharmaceuticals is working on CRM197 fusion constructs with therapeutic proteins of up to 1,000 amino acids in length.[6] Preclinical studies have shown that CRM197 is also suitable for conjugation and presentation of peptide epitopes, a vaccinal approach that could have applications in Streptococcal infection, cancer, or Alzheimer's disease therapy.  History  In 1971 Tsuyoshi Uchida, in the laboratory of Alwin Pappenheimer at Harvard, used nitroguanidine to create mutants of diphtheria toxin, which were called Cross Reacting Materials, or CRMs. One of these mutants, called CRM197, interested researchers because its lack of toxicity suggested a better starting material for diphtheria vaccine than the wild-type protein, and the protein was found to enhance the immunogenicity of bacterial polysaccharides. The pharmaceutical company Wyeth took advantage of this immunogenicity in the 1990s when it conjugated seven polysaccharides from Streptococcus pneumoniae to CRM197 to create the original Prevnar vaccine which was FDA approved in February 2000. A 13-polysaccharides Prevnar was FDA- approved in 2010. The meningococcal vaccine Menveo, from Novartis, is four Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharides plus CRM197. This vaccine gained FDA approval in 2010. External links *Pfenex Inc. is the only fully integrated provider of pre-clinical and cGMP CRM197.

The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. ; 11th Grade Reading: *2012 - 63% on grade level, (22% below basic).

Results withheld from the public by PDE. Science in Motion Canton Junior Senior High School did not take advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012 University of Pittsburgh at Bradford provided the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region. College remediation According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 33% of Canton Senior High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania College Remediation Report, January 2009 Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in mathematics or English. Graduation requirements The Canton Area School Board has determined that a student must earn 27 credits to graduate, including: English 4 credits, Math 4 credits, Social Studies 4 credits, Science 4 credits, Health .25 credit, Physical Education 2 credits, Technology Business 2 credits, and Driver's Ed .25 credit. Participating in a PIAA school sport or cheerleading counts towards a Physical education credit in 11th grade and 12th grade. Additionally, students are required to complete 60 hours of community service or participate in a school sponsored club or sport. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2020, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. The original intent was to gradually add seven more exams including civics and geometry. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated developing any more Keystone Exams in other subjects.PA General Assembly, Act 6 of 2017, June 21, 2017 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed House Bill 202, which makes modifications of the Keystone Exam mandates for students who attend VoTech and Career Tech schools. These pupils will be allowed to use alternate assessments or industry-based certifications. Dual enrollment The Canton Junior Senior High School offers the Pennsylvania dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Guidelines, 2010 Canton Area School District has an agreement with Keystone College. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. In 2010, the district received a $36,192 state grant to be used to assist students with tuition, fees and books. In 2015, the Canton Area School Board approved dual enrollment agreements with Lackawanna College and Keystone College.Eric Hrin., Canton sets meal prices, Daily Review, June 13, 2015 SAT scores In 2016, 33 Canton Area School District students took the SAT exams.

Project 720 grant Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Governor Edward Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth's high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High school's applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Canton Area School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $50,000 funding over three years.Robert Hayes Postupac, PROJECT 720: A CASE STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL REFORM, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell.

The Canton Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online.Canton Area School Board, Bullying/Cyberbullying Policy 249, September 11, 2008 The district participates in the Olweus antibullying program. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. According to the Center for Disease Control's biannual national study of high school students in 2009, five percent of Pennsylvania students did not go to school for at least one day because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3.

The ship was regarded by Spain as a pirate ship and had several narrow escapes. On 23 October 1873 Virginius sailed from Kingston, Jamaica with 102 Cuban insurgents. At Port-au-Prince 300 Remingtons and 300,000 cartridges were loaded on board. At Comito 800 daggers, 800 machetes, a barrel of powder and a case of shoes were loaded. The ship headed for Cuba, but never reached shore. About 6 miles from land it was intercepted by the Spanish warship Tornado under the command of Captain Dionisio Costilla and an 8-hour sea chase ensued. During this chase, guns and equipment were dropped overboard to lighten the ship, however the poor physical condition of the ship and engines caused Captain Fry to surrender the ship barely 6 miles from the Jamaican coast. On 2 November 1873 a council of war was held by Spanish officials after the arrival of the captured Virginius at Santiago de Cuba harbour. Four ranking officers of the Army of Liberation were executed at 6am on 4 November 1873. Following a court-martial on 7 November the captain of Virginius and 36 members of the crew were executed by firing squad the same day. A further 12 Cuban revolutionaries were executed the next day. It was Sir Lambton Loraine who intervened, arriving at Santiago de Cuba harbour as Commander of the British warship HMS Niobe. Commander Loraine immediately sent the following communique to the Spanish Military Commander of Santiago, General Burriel: > Military Commander of Santiago – Sir: I have no orders from my government, > because they are not aware of what is happening; but I assume the > responsibility and I am convinced that my conduct will be approved by Her > Britannic Majesty, because my actions are pro-humanity and pro-civilisation, > I demand that you stop this dreadful butchery that is taking place here. I > do not believe that I need explain what my actions will be in case my demand > is not heeded. (signed) Lambton Loraine Sir Lambton delivered the letter personally and did not leave the office of the military Governor until he received a satisfactory reply. His valiant intervention stopped the executing cold, and thus many Cubans, Americans and Britons were saved by his action. In April 1874, this Captain now, whom had spent his teenage years on HMS Trincomalee, was in New York for 13 days during which he was a welcome recipient of an almost continued round of receptions and evidences of public and private esteem. On 25 April he departed New York, the New York Times reporting: > The vessel moved out of her dock a few minutes after 1 o’clock, Sir Lambton > standing by the gangway with his umbrella raised, puffing quietly on his > cigar and waving adieus with his hat to the little groups of friends on the > pier, who sent him off with a hearty cheer. Later life Sir Lambton became a retired captain in 1885, and a retired rear-admiral in 1889, dying at the age of 78 on 13 May 1917.Quarterdeck magazine, Autumn 2010, Friends of HMS Trincomalee He was the father of British diplomat Sir Percy Loraine (1880-1961).

Llong founded the hospital of \\"Santa Maria del Popolo\\" in Naples where she relocated to (and where she was widowed) and which received numerous papal privileges from Pope Leo X and Pope Adrian VI. Llong was titled as a Servant of God after the cause for her canonization commenced under Pope Leo XIII on 4 September 1892.Capuchine Nun, British Museum, Retrieved 3 December 2015Poor Clares, Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved 3 December 2015 Pope Francis named her as Venerable on 9 October 2017 upon confirming her heroic virtue. Life Maria Llorença Llong was born in Lleida sometime in 1463 to nobles and she relocated to Naples in 1506 alongside her husband Juan Llong (who enjoyed the favor of Ferdinand II of Aragon) despite being paralyzed at the time. Her husband died in 1509 and left her with her three children at which point she went on a pilgrimage to Loreto where she was cured of her paralysis in what she attributed to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Llong became a member of the Franciscans and she founded both a house to care for prostitutes in 1526 and a hospital for ill people. Llong established the hospital of Santa Maria del Popolo in 1519. Llong wanted to go on a pilgrimage but she had a vision that revealed that she should create a women's convent called \\"Santa Maria in Gerasalamme\\" and she wanted to re-establish the original concepts of being simple and humble in addition to poorness of spirit and adherence to the austerities of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Clare of Assisi. This re- establishment followed the lead that Matteo da Bascio had set when he founded the order of the Capuchin monks. Llong's new order was organised with the aid of the Capuchins. Her new order took the habit of the monks and became known as the Capuchin Poor Clares. Like the monks the nuns wore a simple brown tunic knotted with a cord at the waist and a short cape. The sole addition for the nuns was a wimple and a black veil. During her lifetime the first group was copied around the Italian mainland attracting funding from a range of female philanthropists. Her idea to launch an order along the lines of Saint Clare of Assisi was seen as a move to establish the fundermental principles that the saint established in 1212. In 1533 she chose as her spiritual director Saint Cajetan. The founder sought to obtain papal approval for her convent and this led to Pope Paul III issuing his approval in \\"Debitum Pastoralis Officii\\" on 19 February 1935 and later for the official founding on 10 December 1538. Her hospital also received numerous papal privileges from Pope Leo X and Pope Adrian VI while Gian Pietro Carafa - the future Pope Paul IV - supported the founding and maintenance of the hospital. Llong died in Naples on 21 December 1542. Her remains were exhumed in 1935 and all that remained was a skull so it was placed in an urn in her convent. Beatification process The beatification process commenced in an informative process in Naples that Guglielmo Sanfelice d'Acquavilla inaugurated on 9 November 1880 and later closed on 20 March 1883. Theologians assumed charge of all of her writings and approved them to be orthodox on 17 May 1890 - this also allowed for her spiritual writings to be investigated since it formed a critical part of the beatification cause. The official start to the cause came on 4 September 1892 under Pope Leo XIII and she was titled as a Servant of God. Sanfelice opened an apostolic process on 2 December 1893 and the process concluded on 19 December 1903 when Giuseppe Antonio Ermenegildo Prisco closed it. The Congregation of Rites validated the processes on 27 November 1907 and went on to remain inactive for several decades. On 12 June 2004 the then-Capuchin postulator in charge of Franciscan causes Florio Tessari filed a petition to Cardinal Michele Giordano to reopen the cause and the cardinal oversaw the supplementary process from 29 June 2004 until 16 May 2005. The cause's official re-opening was approved on 30 November 2005 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" and then validated the supplementary process on 1 February 2008. The postulation submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. in 2015 and a board of historians approved the cause and the contents of the dossier on 1 September 2015. Theologians met to discuss and approve the cause on 9 March 2017; Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue and named her as Venerable on 9 October 2017. The current postulator for this cause is Carlo Calloni. On 8 March 2005 a dossier was found on an alleged miracle that recorded the cure of Sister Maria Cherubina Pirro who was cured of severe tuberculosis on 15 October 1881 after visiting the remains of Llong.

The offensive Initial government advances On 15 October, government forces launched a large-scale offensive in the northern Latakia countryside. On 19 October, the SAA captured Point 1112, Point 482, Tal Thamamiyah, Kawa Al-Hatab, and Tal Thalatha in the Al-Zahiyah Mountains in northern Latakia after advancing north from the hilltop of Tal Ziwayk. The next day, Russian air strikes killed Basil Zamo, the commander of the rebel 1st Coastal Division, along with four other fighters according to one report. Other reports put the death toll from the attack at 45, including at least 15 civilians. On 30 October, rebels recaptured areas at Kafar Delbah, but pro-government forces denied this. Between 1 and 3 November, heavy clashes for the village of Ghammam in the Mountains of northern Latakia took place. The village was captured four times, with the rebels finally ending up controlling it again. 13 soldiers and an unknown number of rebels were killed. Two days later, government forces captured three villages in the area and on 6 November took control of Ghamam and Jabal Bakdash hill overlooking it. On 9 and 10 November, the rebels were reported to had recaptured some points in the area of Ghamam. However, this was denied by military sources. Between 13 and 23 November, government troops seized 200 square kilometers of territory. On 25 November, they captured three hills (including Tal Al-Yakdash hill) in the mountains of Latakia, advanced around Ghamam and captured the villages of Dayr Hanna, al-Dughmishlyia and Beit ‘Ayyash. Between 18 and 23 November, government forces captured 10 hills (including six in the Jeb al-Ahmar area), three villages and imposed full control over the Al-Zahi Mountains. On 24 November, rebels retook the Al-Zahi Mountains and Tal al-Etyra, while government forces captured a village and hilltop on Jabal Sheikh Mohammad. The following day, government forces advanced in the areas of the Al-Zahi Mountains and Ateera, and recaptured Al- Zahi. Turkish shootdown of Russian plane On 24 November, Turkish F-16's downed a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 near the Syrian-Turkish border. A Russian pilot was killed, while another Russian soldier died in the rescue operation that took place in the northern Latakia mountain area. A Russian rescue helicopter was also destroyed by a TOW crew. The crew remained unharmed. Later that day, the second pilot reached the military airport of Latakia after he was rescued by special forces. Jabal Turkman was subjected to intense bombardment by the Russians after the shootdown of its bomber jet by the Turkish Air Force. On 27 November, the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front and the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria fought against Syrian government and Hezbollah forces around Jabal Nuba, as the Syrian army bombarded them with artillery and Russian warplanes bombed Jabal al-Akrad. The Syrian Army's intense artillery bombardment with hundreds of rockets killed 15 fighters of the Turkistan Islamic Party along with its military leader in Jabal Turkman. Turkistan Islamic Party reported over 30 killed in clashes with government forces during the week. On the same day, government forces captured two more hills and secured Jabal Al-Nuba mountain. Continued government advances On 1 December, government forces captured three villages and the Jabal Al-Kashkar Mountains. With these advances, the Army was in full control of the al-Jeb al-Ahmar area. Between 3 and 15 December, government forces captured up to 20 villages and hills. During this time, Islamist rebels also retook several checkpoints around Jabal al-Nawabah. Two rebel commanders were killed by Russian airstrikes in Latakia Northern countryside. On 16 December, government forces captured the strategic Al-Nuba Mountains (Jabal Al-Nuba) in the northern countryside of Latakia. On the same day, they also seized two hilltops which are located on the border of the Idlib governorate. Between 17 and 20 December, government forces captured another 10 villages and points along the Turkish border, while the rebels retook the Jabal Al-Sayed Mountains and partly retook the Jabal Al-Nuba mountain. On 23 and 24 December, government forces supported by Russian air- strikes, reportedly recaptured the Jabal Al-Nuba mountain and the Jabal Al- Sayed Mountains.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CWgdaoyXIAAD1lt.jpg:large Between 25 December and 10 January, government forces imposed full control over two dozen more villages and hills, including the Katf Al-Alamah area. Of these, the rebels managed to recapture only two villages. Capture of Salma and Rabia On the morning of 12 January, government forces imposed full control over the strategic village of Tartiyah, situated to the east of the rebel stronghold of Salma, considered to be the rebel's most important site in the Kurdish Mountains (Jabal al-Akrad) in the northern countryside of Latakia. Later that day, the military fully seized Salma. The following day, the military expanded its control from Salma, capturing Mrouniyah and Marj Khawkha. By 15 January, they took control of another six villages as rebel defenses collapsed. On 16 January 2016, government forces captured several hills overlooking al-Sarraf, as well as another six villages. On the next day, the military seized two mountaintops near the strategic town of Rabia and six villages throughout Jabal Al-Akrad and the Turkmen Mountain. On 20 January, government advances continued with the seizure of another two villages. However, a rebel counter-attack between 18 and 20 January, led to their recapture of four villages and a hill. Still, their hold on these recaptured positions was weak due to government troops still occupying the strategic heights. On 21 January, a renewed Army assault commenced and by 24 January, they captured 20 villages, surrounding the strategic town of Rabia on three sides. Rabia itself was seized that day. In all, between 12 and 25 January, Russian and Syrian warplanes conducted more than 522 airstrikes, while government ground forces fired more than 3,000 rocket shells and missiles, which led to them taking control of 36 towns and villages, the most important of all being Salma and Rabia, which were the main rebel strongholds in Jabal al-Akrad and Jabal al-Turkman. 72 Syrian soldiers and 124 foreign rebel fighters were killed during these two weeks of operations. SAA push towards Kinsabba Between 27 and 31 January, government forces captured seven villages, Ruweisat Al-Nimr hill and Jabal Al-Mulqa mountain. On 1 February, the rebels recaptured Nawarah (Kelez), near the Turkish border, after government forces had completely withdrawn from the village and its surrounding hills. Meanwhile, east of Jabal al-Turkman (Turkmen Mountains), government forces continued to advance north towards the rebel stronghold of Kinsabba. On 3 February, a Russian military advisor training Syrian soldiers in the use of \\"new weapons\\" was killed by rebel mortar shelling in Salma. Three other Russian soldiers were wounded. Between 6 and 7 February, government troops captured the village of Aliyah (Krouja) and its hill. On the same day, the 103rd Brigade of the Republican Guard and other Syrian paramilitaries crossed a river capturing the village of Bashura. The attack was heavily assisted by Russian airstrikes which targeted Al-Nusra Front and FSA 1st Coastal Brigade defenses. On 8 February, they further advanced and seized four villages, including two in the area of Kinsabba. On 9 February, the Saudi national and senior Al-Nusra Front commander of the Kurdish Mountains, Abdel-Aziz Al-Dibaykhi (nom de guerre \\"Abu Hamza\\") was killed by the Republican Guard's 103rd Brigade. At least 16 Al-Nusra Front fighters were killed by Russian air-strikes as the military regained several positions they had previously lost. Two days later, the rebels recaptured two villages, including Krouja, following fighting that left 12 soldiers dead. On 13 February, the military regained several positions they had lost, including a village. On 14 February, the Army seized three villages, and the following day another seven sites as they pressed towards Kinsabba. With the capture of two more villages on 16 February, the military reached Kinsabba and preparations were started for a final assault on the town. Due to the re-allocation of most of the rebel forces from Tal Ghazaleh hill, that overlooks the Turkish border, to reinforce the defense of Kinsabba, government forces used the opportunity, assaulted the hill and captured it. The attack on Kinsabba started on 17 February, quickly capturing three villages on its western flank and leaving one road open for the rebels to retreat. Kinsabba was secured the following morning. Following this advance, the next aim of the Army was the village of Kabani, one of the highest points in Jabal al-Akrad, that overlooks the Al- Ghaab Plains, and from where the rebels still had the ability to shell places like Qardaha. Final operations Between 20 and 23 February, the Army continued its advances and captured eight villages and a hill north of Kinsabba. On 26 February, government troops took control of Ayn Al-Bayda, on the provincial border between Latakia and Idlib, and on the following day, they seized the village of Saraf and Tal Nawarat hill, that overlooks a Nusra- held border crossing with Turkey. On 2 March, the military launched an assault on Kabani and its hill. Elsewhere, they reportedly captured three villages and a hill. Ten days later, the strategic height of Kabani hill (Hill 1154) was taken by government forces. During this time, the Army also seized the Zuweiqat mountaintop overlooking Kabani.Syria regime presses toward key Idlib town Still, opposition activists reported on 9 March that the rebels had recaptured Zuweiqat.Continued clashes in Lattakia countryside Aftermath Al-Nusra-led rebels launched an assault in mid-April 2016, capturing parts of Jabal al-Qalat (Qalat Mountain) and al-Bayda village. The Syrian Army mounted a counter-attack within days and re-captured all positions they had lost, continuing with the assault on the heights around Kabani again.Syrian Army officially reverses all rebel gains in northern Latakiaقوات النظام تستعيد السيطرة على مناطق خسرتها في هجوم الفصائل الأخير وقصف يستهدف مدينة درعاSyrian Army retakes initiative in northern Latakia to cut the rebel supply line In the course of the fighting, a prominent al-Nusra Front commander was killed: Abu Shakkar, nicknamed \\"The Cannibal\\" because he ate the heart of a Syrian soldier.

Strategic Analysis According to analysis by pro-opposition Al Jazeera, the objective of the Latakia offensive was to consolidate a potential Alawi dominated state (supported by Russia) that would extend from the Coast to Damascus, passing by Hama and Homs. This would entail forcing the population to leave the North of Latakia so that they would be replaced by government supporters. According to the same source, the offensive aims also at embarrassing and pressuring the Turkish government since most of the population in North Latakia are from Turkmen origin. The source attributes the advance by government troops to the powerful missiles used by the Russian airforce and to the lack of support from rebels in Idlib and Hama governorates. On the other hand, the Syrian government claims to be aiming to reconquer the whole of Syria. In this case, after recovering all of Latakia, the next logical step might be to move into neighboring Idlib and recover what was lost to the opposition earlier in the year.

It is a shrub growing in coastal areas of southern Japan and South China including beaches and estuaries where there are no large breaking waves. Description Pentacoelium bontioides is a shrub sometimes growing to a height of with branches that have raised leaf scars, are slightly sticky when young and have pale brown twigs. The leaves are arranged alternately, mostly long, wide, thick and elliptic in shape. They have an obvious mid-vein on the lower surface and are slightly sticky when young. The flowers are arranged singly or in pairs in the axils of leaves on a stalk long. There are 5 egg-shaped, green, glabrous, pointed sepals and 5 petals joined at their bases, forming a bell-shaped tube. The petals are white to pale pinkish, spotted with purple on the petal lobes and inside the tube. The tube is long and the lobes are somewhat shorter than the tube. The outside of the tube is glabrous but the inside sometimes has a few hairs. There are 4 stamens which extend beyond the petal tube. Flowering occurs from April to June and is followed by purplish red, roughly spherical fruits, in diameter, which turn pale brown as they dry. Taxonomy and naming Pentacoelium bontioides was first formally described in 1846 by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini and the description was published in Abhandlungen der Mathematisch-Physikalischen Klasse der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. The genus name Pentacoelium is derived from the Ancient Greek words pente meaning \\"five\\" and koilos meaning \\"hollow\\". The specific epithet (bontioides) is a derived from the Ancient Greek εἶδος (eîdos) meaning “form\\" or \\"likeness”, referring to the similarity of this species to plants in the genus Bontia. Distribution and habitat Pentacoelium bontioides occurs in coastal areas of southern Japan and South China including Taiwan and Hong Kong. It grows above the high tide line on beaches, around bays and along estuaries.
