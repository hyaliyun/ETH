Career  Khabawsokar's tomb inscriptions are of the highest interest to Egyptologists and historians alike. In fact, they belong to the earliest examples of richly decorated tomb niches with detailed lists comprising bureaucratic titles, priestly offices and honorary titles. Additionally, Khabawsokar is, by far, the official with the highest number of priesthood titles for his time.Dagmar Budde: Die Göttin Seschat. Wodtke und Stegbauer, Leipzig 2000, , p. 66-70. In his tomb, Khabawsokar is depicted once as a sitting man in a tight gown, reaching out for an offering table full of bread (or cake). A jamb of a false door depicts him twice, each time looking into converse directions. His pose makes him look like he is stepping out of the door. On both of the jambs his real (\\"great\\") name and his nickname are spelled. Khabawsokar wears a fine curled wig, a heavy and finely ornamented gold collar and a belt with a golden lion head as a belt buckle. His kilt is made of leopard fur and his shoulder knots are jackal-shaped. Possible contemporary office partners of Khabawsokar may have been Hesyre, Metjen, Pehernefer and Akhetaa. These are likewise known for their unusually rich decorated tomb chapels and for their accurately reported careers. However, it is not proven that these officials were related to each other in any way.  Tomb  Khabawsokar's tomb, the double mastaba S-3037 was found in 1889 at North Saqqara by French archaeologist Auguste Mariette. The tomb once measured circa 33 x 19 metres and was built of mud bricks. A short corridor leads to a broad hall, forming a t-shaped crossway; the hall has walls which are niched and covered with polished limestone.

Notable diving locations are Half Moon Caye Wall, Long Caye Aquarium (\\"The Aquarium\\"), Silver Caves, Tres Cocos, and West Point. In addition to these coral reefs, it is also home to the Great Blue Hole.  Flora and fauna  The flora on the reef islands is mostly coconut trees. On the western half of Half Moon Caye there is a rare surviving example of an atoll siricote (Cordia sebestena) forest, while there is natural vegetation on Sandbore Cay. Half Moon Caye is home to a rookery of magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens), as well as a nesting colony of some 4000 red-footed booby (Sula sula). A colony of white-crowned pigeons (Columba leucocephala) formerly nested on Long Cay but has been wiped out by overhunting. The most dominant fish species at the reef are creole wrasse (Clepticus parrae) and blue chromis (Chromis cyanea). Other prevalent species are (in descending order of prevalence) blackcap basslet (Gramma melacara), bicolor damselfish (Pomacentrus partitus), brown chromis (Chromis multilineata), yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), royal gramma (Gramma loreto), masked goby (Coryphopterus personatus), and sunshine chromis (Chromis insolata).

It was completed in 1551. A large painting, it depicts a peasant market scene, with an abundance of meats and other foods. In the background, it shows a scene from the biblical theme of the flight into Egypt, where the Virgin Mary is seen stopped on the road, giving alms to the poor. Thus, although the painting seems to be at first sight an ordinary still life concentrating on foodstuffs, it is rich with symbolism; it in fact hides a symbolic religious meaning, and embodies a visual metaphor encouraging spiritual life. Aertsen made a name for himself during the 1550s painting scenes from everyday life in a naturalistic manner. Painter Aertsen's paintings of fruit and vegetable stalls, such as Market Scene (pictured), are similar in composition to that of A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms. Pieter Aertsen was a masterful still-life painter from Amsterdam, who worked for many years in Antwerp. He was a representative of the 16th-century Northern Renaissance style, more specifically Northern Mannerism, a new era for painting in the Netherlands and the German countries characterised by precise observation and naturalism that gave the art of painting impulses of realism. Many Northern artists travelled to Italy to study, where they were influenced by the innovations of the Italian Renaissance and in turn influenced the Italian Renaissance painters with techniques such as the newly developed technique of oil painting. Aertsen is regarded as one of the founders of the still life painting. His style was particularly new: he mixed characteristics of the still life and the genre painting in his works, which, like A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, are seen as pioneers in the still life genre that grew out of details of paintings containing figure subjects. His compositions in the Flemish tradition were remarkably original, like this painting of a meat stall, with a large, life-size still life in the foreground and three smaller scenes appearing through openings in the background. Since the Protestants rejected the tradition of Catholic arts, many of Aertsen's paintings were destroyed by the iconoclasts, especially his altarpieces, some of which were chopped into pieces. Only the parts of the paintings containing the less religious details were spared. Thus, the era of religious paintings declined in the Protestant countries. Aertsen painted A Meat Stall a few years before he moved to Amsterdam from Antwerpen. Painting The artwork of A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms consists of a large painting on panel in oil, depicting a profusion of foodstuffs in a highly realistic style, while the narrative is hidden in the background, seen through the stall windows and openings. Aertsen's paintings were often made in an \\"inverted still life\\" style in which the still-life aspects were in the foreground and the narrative aspects in the background. The viewer's senses are distracted by the rich display of various foods – plates in the foreground, meats, ham, lard, smoked fish, pigs' legs and head, bread, butter, milk, cheese and hanging pretzels (in the left corner) – that has been spread out in front of the viewer, and the figure subject is overwhelmed by the still-life composition. The various meats, including sausages, beef, fish, fowl and pork, are arranged on wooden tables, using baskets, pots and plates. A barrel and some wickerwork chairs serve as containers for the food items as well. This sign reads in Flemish: \\"behind here are 154 rods of land for sale immediately, either by the rod according to your convenience or all at once\\". Almost unnoticed at first are glimpses through the stall windows of an imaginary landscape with a road. Through the smaller window in the middle is a second landscape with a distant view. These small landscapes are hiding a religious narrative: they depict the Holy Family distributing alms on their journey to Egypt to escape from Herod's harassment. The other people depicted on the road are walking in the direction of the church. Both those people and the Holy family are dressed in contemporary Netherlandish clothing. On the right side, behind a figure drawing water from the well, there is a tavern with genre figures depicting a merry company eating oysters and mussels. In front of the tavern hangs a pig carcass that is very similar to Rembrandt's painting of a slaughtered ox. The ground around the inn is covered with oyster shells, which allude to lust. In the tavern there is a scene showing the biblical theme of the prodigal son, and the woman depicted in the tavern may be a prostitute with her customers. The painting is rich with symbolic representation: it conveys hidden messages. The fish, displayed crossed on a pewter plate, are a reference to Lent, when the faithful abstained from eating meat. The contrast between the charity of the poor fugitives giving alms and the richness and abundance of the food conveys a certain religious symbolism and hidden meaning, linking to the idea of \\"food for the body\\" with the idea of \\"food for the soul\\", the spiritual \\"bread of life\\", appealing to the viewers to turn their attention away from the things of this world. The entire Holy Family is depicted in this part of the painting. Mary, holding the Christ child and riding a donkey, led by Joseph, offers bread to a poor family, sharing what little they have. The young boy and his father are receiving the bread from Mary, with the bread representing the Eucharist. The abundance and richness of the food in the stall is probably a satire on gluttony. The meat can also be seen as a symbolic representation of, and allusion to, the 'weak flesh' (Matthew 26:41). The slaughtered animals may symbolise the death of a believer, a fairly common iconography in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the upper right-hand part of the painting, a handwritten sign is posted on a wood placard. In Flemish, the variety of the Dutch language spoken in Flanders in northern Belgium, it reads, \\"behind here are 154 rods of land for sale immediately, either by the rod according to your convenience or all at once\\". Scholarly discussion about the sign has reached a general consensus that the message \\"functions as a metaphorical commentary on this scene\\", conveying a warning about society losing spiritual wealth by placing too great an emphasis upon material gain.

Background Tort immunity for foreign sovereigns The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 codified the longstanding common law principle that foreign sovereigns could not be held liable for torts in United States courts.28 U.S.C. §§ 1602–1611. After its enactment, the Act became \\"the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in [United States] courts\\".Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp. . The Act states that United States courts may only exercise subject matter jurisdiction in cases brought by a private citizen against a foreign sovereign when the suit falls within one of the Act's enumerated exceptions.Lee M. Caplan, The Constitution and Jurisdiction over Foreign States: The 1996 Amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in Perspective, 41 369, 405 (2001) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a)). Absent subject matter jurisdiction, United States Courts may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign.Lee M.

However, one of the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act's enumerated exceptions is the commercial activity exception, which specifies that foreign sovereigns may be held liable in United States courts when \\"the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by [a] foreign state\\".28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2). According to the Act, the definition of a \\"foreign state\\" also includes an \\"agency or instrumentality\\" of the foreign state.28 U.S.C. § 1603(a). Initial lawsuit Carol Sachs, a resident of California, purchased a Eurail pass from a Massachusetts-based travel agent in March 2007.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 2. She arrived in Innsbruck, Austria, one month after purchasing her Eurail pass, where she intended to board a train operated by OBB Personenverkehr AG (OBB) bound for Prague. When Sachs attempted to board the train, she fell from the platform onto the tracks and suffered traumatic personal injuries.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 2–3 (internal citations omitted). Sachs filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in which she alleged OBB was responsible for causing her injuries.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 3. Although OBB was operated by the Austrian Ministry of Transport, Sachs argued her suit was not barred by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act because her suit was based upon the railway's act of selling her a Eurail pass in the United States. In response, OBB moved to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that Sachs' suit was barred by sovereign immunity. The district court granted OBB's motion, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 4 (citing Sachs v. Republic of Aus., 2011 WL 816854, *1, *4 (ND Cal., Jan. 28, 2011); Sachs v. Republic of Aus., 695 F.3d 1021 (9th Cir. 2012)).

OBB then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 23, 2015.OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 135 S. Ct. 1172 (2015). Opinion of the Court Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice John Roberts held that Sachs' injury was \\"based upon\\" conduct that occurred solely in Austria, and the suit therefore fell outside the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act's commercial activity exception.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 5. Although the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not define the phrase \\"based upon\\" with specificity, Chief Justice Roberts explained that the Court's 1993 ruling in Saudi Arabia v. NelsonSaudi Arabia v. Nelson, . should guide the Court's analysis in this case.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 5–6. In Nelson, the Court held that the Saudi Arabian government was protected by sovereign immunity in a tort suit brought by an American who alleged he was tortured by Saudi police after reporting safety violations in a Saudi hospital.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 5–6; see also Nelson, 507 U.S. at 353–58. Although the plaintiff alleged the suit was based upon commercial activity that occurred when the Saudi hospital recruited the plaintiff in America, the Court ruled that the plaintiffs claims involved \\"sovereign acts\\" rather than commercial activity.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 6 (citing Nelson, 507 U.S. at 358). The Court ultimately held that the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act's \\"based upon\\" provision requires courts to identify the \\"particular conduct\\" upon which a plaintiff's claim is based.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 6 (citing Nelson, 507 U.S. at 357) (internal quotations omitted). Applying the Nelson analysis to the facts of this case, Chief Justice Roberts held that \\"the conduct constituting the gravamen of Sachs’s suit plainly occurred abroad\\". Justice Roberts also concluded that \\"[u]nder any theory of the case\\", there was \\"nothing wrongful about the sale of the Eurail pass standing alone\\". To support his arguments, Chief Justice Roberts cited a letter written by former Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. to then-professor Felix Frankfurter, which explained that the \\"essentials of a personal injury narrative will be found at the point of contact — the place where the boy got his fingers pinched\\". Chief Justice Roberts wrote that \\"[a]t least in this case, that insight holds true\\".OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 9. Therefore, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that Sach's suit did not fall within the commercial activity exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and that the Ninth Circuit's opinion should be reversed for lack of jurisdiction.OBB Personenverkehr, slip op. at 10–11. Analysis and commentary Although some commentators suggested the Court's opinion may have a significant impact in tort cases involving foreign sovereigns, other commentators suggested the case's impact would be limited. Lyle Denniston, for example, noted that although \\"the case focused on one American and one incident, it may well have larger meaning\\" and that following the Court's opinion, foreign railroads \\"could rarely, if ever, be held accountable for causing injuries, or worse\\".Lyle Denniston, Constitution Check: Do U.S. laws protect Americans traveling overseas?, (Dec. 3, 2015). However, Amy Howe wrote that the Court's decision \\"at first blush appears less momentous than we might have expected when the Court agreed to take the case on earlier this year\\".Amy Howe, First decision of the Term is a unanimous one in Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act case, (Dec. 1, 2015).

Overview of the result As in previous years there was a close run election. Labour had increased their majority by taking up 15 of the 19 aldermanic seats following the previous two elections. Boundary changes There were no boundary changes at this election. Retiring aldermen A number of retiring Labour councillors stood down to allow retiring aldermen to be returned unopposed. Unopposed returns A large number of members were again returned unopposed. Contested elections Of the contests that took place, the most heated was in Llanarthney, where Labour Alderman Edgar Lewis, a member of the authority since 1931 (and who had not faced a contested election since the 1930s) was opposed by Ratepayer Austin Griffiths, a retired colonial officer who had captured the seat at a by-election. In St Ishmaels, Labour councillor C.J. Burgess, who had won the seat by a narrow margin at the previous election, had left the Labour group shortly before the election, but narrowly held the seat against another labour candidate.

She was a member of the West German Bundestag (National Parliament) for two decades, until 1969. However, she was firmly rooted in the regional politics of her home city, Oberhausen, of which she was the appointed Mayor from 1946 till 1948. Following the establishment in 1949, by three of the four principal occupying powers, of West Germany, Albertz was elected mayor of Oberhausen in 1956 and held the office till her death in 1979. She was the first female mayor of a major city in Germany. Life Early years Luise Alberz was born in the city of Duisburg, in the western part of Germany's heavily industrialised Ruhr region, and approximately 12 km (7 miles) to the west of Oberhausen, where she made her career. Her father was the SPD activist (1877-1945), who later became a member of the Prussian Landtag (regional parliament) and whose life would end in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Luise Albertz herself joined the youth wing of the Social Democratic Party (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands / SPD) in 1915, and joined the party itself as soon as she was old enough. On leaving school she undertook an apprenticeship in local administration with the city hall in Oberhausen before obtaining a permanent post as a book-keeper and then, from 1921 till 1933, heading up a branch of \\"Neueste Nachrichten\\", a regional daily newspaper produced on behalf of the city authorities. She remained in that job till 1933 which was a year of major regime change in Germany. During that year the Hitler government quickly established one-party dictatorship, which meant that membership of any political party (unless you chose the Nazi Party) was banned. The political affiliations of the Albertz family, and their contempt for Nazi philosophy, were no secret, and under the terms of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (\\"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums\\" / \\"Berufsbeamtengesetz\\"), signed into law in April 1933, Luise Albertz was dismissed from her job in public service. Between 1934 and 1939 she worked as a foreign currency book-keeper (\\"Devisenbuchhalterin\\"). In 1939 war broke out, and with many male council workers sent away to join the army Albertz was one of those conscripted back into the public sector to replace them, working for the Oberhausen city administration as a municipal clerk and welfare officer. Political career War ended in May 1945, with northern Germany, including Oberhausen, now designated as the British zone of occupation. Albertz at this stage was secretary to the city's mayor, but now underwent a rapid succession of job changes and promotions. Under the military occupation she was herself elected to the city council in 1946 and in the same year herself appointed as city mayor. Although she had been a members of the Social Democratic Party for more than two decades, sources are silent on her political activity till this point, suggesting that within the family public politics had been left to her father Hermann Albertz. During the twelve Nazi years the family were monitored by the authorities, regularly summoned for interrogation sessions and their home subject to periodic raids. On 20 July 1944 an assassination attempt was made against Adolf Hitler. The dictator survived, but his regime had already prepared a list of several thousand names, to be used in the event of an escalation in political tension on the home front, and the name of Hermann Albertz was listed. In the context of the wave of arrests known as \\"Aktion Gitter\\", in August 1944 Hermann Albertz was arrested and taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Two months later he was transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Nothing is known of his subsequent fate, but sources assume he died or was murdered by the Nazis in the closing months of the war. Luise Albertz participated in postwar reconstruction as a member of the \\"Zone Advisory Board\\" (\\"Zonenbeirat\\") in the British zone, and was also appointed to a position on the supervisory board of the important heavy engineering Hüttenwerke Oberhausen AG business. In addition she was appointed to the administrative board of the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (broadcasting organisation) for the British occupation zone, and was a member of the German Council of the European Movement International. Between 20 April 1947 and 17 June 1950 she sat as a member of the Regional Parliament for North Rhine-Westphalia, winning a seat for the electoral district of Oberhausen in the first election to a chamber that had been established the previous years, at that stage as a nominated assembly, by the British forces of occupation. The Germany Federal Republic (West German) was founded in May 1949 and the first national election was held in August 1949. The name of Luise Albertz was high enough on the SPD party list of candidates for North Rhine-Westphalia to enable her to win a seat in the new Bundestag under the semi-proportional electoral system used. Later, in 1965, she won a seat directly tied to an electoral district, representing Oberhausen with a remarkable 52.6% of votes cast. In total Luise Albertz sat in the Bundestag for twenty years. From 1949 till 3 June 1959 she served as chairman of the Chamber's Petitions Commission. Personal Luise Albertz remained childless and unmarried.

It produces rectified imagery plans, true ortho- projections on planar, cylindric and conic surfaces, 3D photorealistic models, measurements from photography and mappings on a photographic base for uses in the cultural heritage sector, mainly conservation. Products The metigo product line currently consists of *the mapping software metigo MAP, *the stereo-photogrammetry modeling software metigo 3D, *the free viewer metigo VIEW. These products are all standalone and are not depending on other software, such as AutoCAD. metigo MAP metigo MAP is mainly used to map findings and conservation measured on a uniform metric photographic base. Therefore, photos of planar surfaces can be rectified based on geometrical informations, e.g. height and width of a rectangle, or cartesian coordinates measured by total station. Beside rectified imagery several other metric mapping bases can be imported and used: * true ortho-projections; * scaled scans of plans and plots; * CAD-files; * 3D models, such as digital surface models (DSM) produced by stereo-photogrammetry, SfM or 3D scanning. metigo MAP 's strong point is that rectified imagery taken with different techniques (visual light, sided light, IR, UV, UV-fluorescence, X-ray), historic images and photos taken at various stages of the conservation process can be superimposed and evaluated mutually. The user can allocate several attributes, such as different conservation measures and damage classes, to the mapped geometries. The mappings can be analysed by geometries as well as by user- defined attributes at any stage of the project. metigo MAP targets mainly conservators in different cultural heritage fields. Using it no specialist knowledge of surveying and photogrammetric techniques are needed. metigo 3D metigo 3D is a stereo-photogrammetric kit that allows to * calculate bundle adjustments (axios3D), * create high-quality 3D point clouds using multiple stereo photo pairs combined with metric survey data, * mesh these point clouds, * texture the meshes with high-resolution image data to create photo-realistic models, * ortho-project orientated images on digital surface models (DSM) on planes and best-fit cylinders and cones, * create unwrappings and developed views of curved surfaces, * analyse deformations of 3D surfaces. metigo 3D targets metric survey specialists working in the cultural heritage sector.

Background  An aircraft rudder is a flight control surface used to control rotation around its vertical axis, known as yaw, which is especially important during takeoff, landing, and emergency conditions. Rudders are typically found within the vertical stabilizer of the aircraft. Excessive use of rudder can exceed the ultimate load of the vertical stabilizer, causing structural failure. For this reason, modern airliners and fly-by-wire aircraft often include a system to prevent excessive rudder deflection. The rudder travel limiter in the Airbus A300-600 is controlled by the Feel and Limitation Computers (FLC) maintaining sufficient yaw control within the entire flight envelope and limiting excessive lateral loads on the rudder and vertical stabilizer.  Notable Accidents  Faults with rudder travel limiters were involved in the crashes of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 and American Airlines Flight 587. After the latter crash Airbus changed the rudder travel limiter on the Airbus A300-600 from a variable ratio design to a variable stop design, as the latter is less complex, with less severe failure modes.

The film was released January 14, 1916. Starring Madison as an innocent young country girl who becomes involved in a love affair, the film is noted for its use of the \\"matte process\\" which Madison uses to explain time and distance in the narrative. This powerful feminist melodrama was released around the same time that many suffragette films were produced. Her Defiance is usually associated with other feminist melodramas that Madison produced in this year including Alias Jane Jones, A Soul Enslaved, and A Heart's Crucible. Motion Picture News claimed Her Defiance was \\"a sympathetic subject along conventional lines but benefited by several original situations that add much to its value,\\" on January 15, 1916.  Plot  Adeline Gabler (Cleo Madison) is a young farm girl whose brother is scheming to marry her off to an elderly rich neighbor, \\"Old Scapin\\" (Willis Marks). When Adeline falls in love with a city boy, Frank Warren (Edward Hearn), her brother Theron (Taylor N. Duncan) takes the first opportunity to trick his sister into believing her lover has abandoned her. Adeline, pregnant, is forced to marry Scapin, but at the conclusion of the ceremony, she creates havoc by pushing her husband away and escaping in a buggy to the city. Scapin and Theron pursue her, but their buggy crashes and Scapin is killed. Not knowing she is now a widow, Adeline works as a cleaning woman to support herself and her son. She is sent to work in her former lover's office, where he finds the baby. Adeline confronts Frank, who explains, in a flashback inserted on one side of the screen, how he wrote her a crucial letter that she never received. The sequence can be read as representing the point of view of the woman as she weighs the statements of her lover against her memories of the events.  Film techniques  Her Defiance was extremely notable for Madison's use of \\"matting,\\" a process she desired to signify time and distance passing in the short silent film. The matte process is a very old technique, dating back to the late 1890s. It is used in photography and special effects filmmaking, combining various images into a single image. Madison uses this in her final scene when Adeline and Frank are speaking, while on one side of the screen past actions are shown.  Character traits  Madison's character in Her Defiance is a strong willed woman, but she was usually cast as needy heroines, much different from the attitude the actress portrayed in her real life. Photoplay journalist William Henry reported, > Cleo Madison is a womanly woman – if she were otherwise she couldn't play > sympathetic parts as she does – and yet she is so smart and businesslike > that she makes most of the male population of Universal city look like > debutants when it comes right down to brass tacks and affairs.\\" Cleo Madison > had answered Henry with, \\"One of these days men are going to get over the > fool idea that women have no brains and quit getting insulted at the thought > that a skirt-wearer can do their work quite as well as they can. And I don't > believe that day is very far distant, either. Madison's time as a director and actress was short, and by the 1920s she was back to playing minor roles in small films. She quit acting in 1924 and died of a heart attack in 1964.

As the day progressed, Krupa Rao, as Chairperson of the Board of Governors together with Governor Ryder Devapriam ensured that efforts were made to maintain a proper quorum resulting in holding of the Board of Governors meeting which then resolved to pass on the 4-year cycle of Principalship to the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church Society. Suppogu Joseph was the outgoing Principal while M. Victor Paul was the Principal- designate during 1990. Incidentally, both Suppogu Joseph and M. Victor Paul happened to tutor Krupa Rao during his upgrading studies at Andhra Christian Theological College at its erstwhile campus at Rajahmundry.

Early career Born in 1890 in Wilmington, Delaware, Walton made her debut in 1907 in the chorus of the musical comedy The Girl Behind the Counter, produced by Lew Fields. Florence helped popularize the tango, fox-trot and other forms of ballroom dancing with her husband, Swiss-born Maurice Mouvet, and later with Allan Fagan and Leon Leitrim. Walton was introduced to Mouvet by the musical manager Florence Ziegfeld in 1911 when Ziegfeld partnered the two in his production of The Rose Maid. They married that same year and together formed one of the most successful exhibition ballroom teams of their day as well as became two of cabaret's earliest stars. Together they were promoted as Maurice and Walton, or simply \\"The Waltons.\\" During America's dance mania of the 1910s Florence Walton and Maurice Mouvet were considered as a team second only to The Castles. Walton claimed to be the first American to entertain American troops in the war zone during World War I, claiming in 1914 during a performance with Mouvet at the Palace that during her time abroad she has taught King George V and Queen Mary the tango. The internationally famous couple divorced in 1920. Maurice and Walton Walton first came to perform with her husband after Mouvet's dancing partner Medeleine d'Arville eloped with a young Englishman and she was picked d'Arville's replacement by Florence Ziegfeld. Prior to performing with her husband Maurice Mouvet, Walton was featured in numerous shows including The Soul Kiss in 1908, The Bachelor Belles in 1910, and The Pink Lady in 1911. She later returned to the perform at the Palace with a new dancing partner, Allan Fagan. In October 1920, New York Dramatic Mirror published a rave review of Walton and Fagan's routine claiming Walton \\"spells and dances class.\\" Walton performed at many famous venues during her career, including New York's Club Ostend and at the New York Hippodrome where she worked with other famous names in Vaudeville such as W.C. Fields and Frances White. In 1913, Florence Walton and her husband notably introduced to vaudeville Luckey Roberts' \\"Junk Man Rag.\\" In 1916, Florence Walton and her husband starred in the silent film drama The Quest of Life.  Solo career  Florence and Maurice's publicly broke up in 1919, officially divorcing in 1920. The war had strained their professional and marital relationship. From 1917 to 1919 Walton was performing with other contemporary dancers while her husband Maurice served in the army medical corps in France, although they would periodically reunite for special performances while he was on duty. Florence and Maurice performed together briefly at the war's end, appearing in The Ziegfeld Follies of 1919 before their divorce in 1920 which ended their professional relationship. Florence went on to perform briefly with the Parisian cabaret dancer Alexandre Vlad before partnering with Leon Leitrum in 1922, who she later married. Walton and Leistrum made a name for themselves in Paris before ultimately returning to the United States where they performed in supper clubs and on the Keith vaudeville circuit. Leitrum made a public engagement at the Marigny Theatre in 1923. Soon after Walton and her new husband were in a publicity war with Maurice Mouvet and his new partner Leonora Hughes.

It is based on the short story of same name by E. L. Doctorow,\\"Wakefield\\" (short story), The New Yorker, January 14, 2008 which was in turn inspired by the 1835 story of the same title by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016 and was released in the United States on May 19, 2017. Plot Howard Wakefield, a successful attorney in New York City, is unhappy in his marriage of fifteen years to Diana, a beautiful art curator and former dancer. They used flirtation with other people to add excitement to their sex life, but Diana soon begins to resent it. One night, Howard returns home late from his commute, which has been disrupted and delayed by a widespread power outage, and is distracted by a raccoon he sees entering his garage, which is detached from the house. He chases the raccoon into the garage's attic and realizes he has a perfect view into his house, where his wife and two daughters, Taylor and Giselle, are eating dinner. He ignores calls from his wife and is amused at her clear annoyance, but is insulted when she angrily throws his plate of dinner away instead of saving it for him. To avoid a fight, he decides to wait a bit to go into the house, but he ends up falling asleep. The next morning, Howard realizes Diana will never believe his story of spending the night in the garage and will insist he was having an affair, so he plans to wait for her to leave for work before going in. Instead, he is shocked when, after finding his car still in the garage, she calls the police to report him missing. Howard feels bad when he sees Diana cry, but before he can go inside, his overbearing mother-in-law, Babs, shows up to comfort her. Babs and Diana appear to argue about his absence, with Diana showing her mother there is no evidence he has taken any money to run off. Howard finally goes inside to shower after Diana leaves for work, planning to just deal with the fallout of his absence, before he starts resenting the idea that she is carrying on with her routine after his disappearance. He realizes that his disappearance is probably a relief to her, believing that she probably thinks that she married the wrong man. He cleans up any evidence that he was at the house, grabs some food from the pantry and returns to the garage. Howard is overjoyed with abandoning all his responsibilities and amused that people would surely suspect his wife's involvement in his disappearance, just as he is amused at seeing her tackle the chores that used to be his responsibility. He feels unshackled and free as he spends his time doing puzzles, reading and observing his family and their neighbors. He also happily realizes that he is seeing more of his daughters' lives than he did before. For the first few days, he continues to sneak food and amenities from his house. He soon realizes that he no longer cares about having clients and being freshly showered and shaved, and vows not to take anything from his old life or spend the money he has in his wallet. He begins foraging each night through the trash and showers in the backyard bathroom built by his neighbor, Dr. Sondervan, who runs a small home for mentally disabled youth. As months go by and he grows a beard and long hair, Howard is free to walk about town during the day, where people dismiss him as homeless. The only people who discover his presence are Herbert and Emily, two of Dr. Sondervan's residents, who follow him back to the attic one day. He reflects on the beginning of his relationship with Diana, whom he met when she was dating his best friend Dirk Morrison, an extremely competitive Wall Street trader. Through manipulation and dishonesty, Howard managed to take Diana away from Dirk, and as he thinks back, Howard wonders if he ever truly loved her. Nevertheless, he realizes that by simply disappearing, he has the upper hand in controlling her love life. If he had just divorced her, she would be free to date other men, but while he is missing under mysterious circumstances, she can't easily move on to another man. As summer turns into fall, Howard no longer basks in his freedom but instead feels like he has become a prisoner of his choices. He has an epiphany and realizes that he had been a selfish, jealous and resentful husband and father, who made himself out to be a victim. While he feels happy to be free from himself, he also feels that his family is happier without him. He also realizes that he has never loved Diana more and one day, he walks out onto the sidewalk, but Diana does not recognize him. Diana appears to be developing a romantic relationship, and Howard is stunned when he sees it is with Dirk. Howard surmises that Dirk would have probably told Diana the lies he had said that broke them up years ago. He decides to give Diana an honest chance this time to pick with whom she wants to be. After getting himself cleaned up and buying a new suit, Howard works up the courage to walk back into his house. As he sees his wife and daughters decorating the Christmas tree, he envisions them being overjoyed at his return, and also envisions a second scenario in which they respond with horror. He pauses, and then comes in through the front door and announces, \\"I'm home.\\" Cast * Bryan Cranston as Howard Wakefield * Jennifer Garner as Diana Wakefield * Beverly D'Angelo as Babs, Diana's mother * Jason O'Mara as Dirk Morrison, Howard's former friend and Diana's ex-boyfriend * Ian Anthony Dale as Ben Jacobs, an attorney at Howard's firm * Alexander Zale as Dr. Sondervan, the Wakefields' next-door neighbor * Pippa Bennett-Warner as Emily, mentally disabled ward of Dr. Sondervan * Isaac Leyva as Herbert, mentally disabled ward of Dr. Sondervan. * Ellery Sprayberry as Giselle Wakefield, Howard and Diana's teen daughter * Victoria Bruno as Taylor Wakefield, Howard and Diana's teen daughter Production On November 11, 2015, it was announced that Robin Swicord would direct a drama film based on the short story Wakefield by E. L. Doctorow, after the short story of the same title by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Bonnie Curtis and Julie Lynn would produce the film through Mockingbird Pictures, along with Elliott Webb as co-producer. Swicord had written the screenplay after meeting with Doctorow and discussing her ideas on how to present the story on film. She said, \\"I had to really interrogate the story before I ever got up the courage to meet with Doctorow, because I knew he was going to want to know what kind of movie this was going to be. I met him and we had great conversations. We emailed and talked on the phone, and started the process of getting him to trust that we had all our ducks in a row.\\" Principal photography on the film began on November 30, 2015, in Pasadena, California, and ended on January 8, 2016. Release The film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It went onto screen at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2016. Shortly after, IFC Films acquired distribution rights to the film and set the film for a May 19, 2017 limited release.

Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Thanks to a committed, powerhouse performance by Bryan Cranston, Wakefield is a fascinating character study of a decidedly unpleasant character.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"In this haunting, darkly funny and elegiac mood piece, Cranston once again displays a nearly unparalleled ability to make us like and care about men who are selfish and impetuous and reckless — yet still seem to have a core of decency buried deep within.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"The role is a beast, and Cranston, in a tour de force of touching gravity and aching humanism, gives it everything he's got. It's astounding to watch, and an award-caliber performance from an actor who keeps springing surprises.\\" On RogerEbert.com, critic Glenn Kenny said Swicord \\"has made a smart, intriguing, sometimes provocative and often oddly moving picture of Wakefield,\\" which he called \\"kind of a wonder.\\" References External links  2016 films American films American comedy-drama films 2016 comedy-drama films Films shot in California Films based on short fiction Films directed by Robin Swicord Films produced by Bonnie Curtis Films with screenplays by Robin Swicord Films set in Connecticut ","title":"Wakefield (film)"},{"id":"48701324","text":"Alistair D.

Airport '79. They are based on the 1968 novel Airport by Arthur Hailey. The only actor who appeared in all four films is George Kennedy in his recurring role of Joseph \\"Joe\\" Patroni. Patroni's character evolves from a chief mechanic in Airport to a vice president of operations in Airport 1975, a consultant in Airport '77, and an airline pilot in The Concorde ... Airport '79. Reception The first Airport film from 1970 had reviews complimenting the film's influence on the disaster genre and its \\"camp value.\\" In 1971, Burt Lancaster, star of the 1970 Airport, said in reaction to the 1970 film's 10 Academy Award nominations, that the film was \\"the biggest piece of junk ever made.\\" The New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael called Airport 1975 \\"cut-rate swill\\", produced on a TV-movie budget by mercenary businessmen. Kael also wrote the audio problems gave Karen Black's voice a metallic sound that was grating and that the main character, a stewardess, was constantly being patronized by men. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called Airport 1975 \\"a silly sequel with a 747\\". In a review of Airport '77 The New York Times wrote, \\"Airport '77 looks less like the work of a director and writers than like a corporate decision.\\" Variety′s review of The Concorde ... Airport '79 called the film an \\"unintentional comedy\\". In a review of The Concorde ... Airport '79 The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote \\"\\"Concorde\\" is enough to persuade anyone to stay on the ground.\\" No further Airport films were produced after The Concorde, although media reports in the early 1980s suggested a fifth film was considered. The 1980 comedy film Airplane!, though more specifically a remake/spoof of the 1957 film Zero Hour! (itself a precursor to the Airport concept with a screenplay by Arthur Hailey), is often identified as a spoof of the Airport series. It spawned its own follow-up, Airplane II: The Sequel, in 1982.

She was a core member of the group that published The Woman's Bible in the 1890s. Biography Ellen B. Battelle was born in Virginia, one of several daughters of the Rev. Gordon Battelle and Maria (Tucker) Battelle. Her father had been a member of the convention that framed Virginia's constitution. She married William A. Dietrick of Baltimore and they moved to Covington, Kentucky. There Dietrick established various organizations to aid women: a Women's Educational and Industrial Union, a day nursery, a cooperative bakery and cooking school, and a home for elderly women. She campaigned for civic reform in such areas as jail conditions and city government, and it was said of her that she \\"ran the town\\". In 1888, she was the founding vice-president of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association (KERA). The following year, Dietrick, KERA founder Laura Clay, and three other women established the Kentucky Lecture Bureau to provide free speakers on suffrage-related topics to clubs and civic organizations around the state. She served in other official capacities in the national suffrage movement. After moving to Boston, she served as state organizer and general agent for the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association (1892) and secretary of the New England Woman Suffrage Association (ca. 1895). In the 1890s, she also served as the chair of press work for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She later served as president of the Boston Suffrage League (founded in 1903 by William Monroe Trotter). Dietrick lectured on equal rights and wrote for various publications, including the Woman's Journal. Her main topic was equal rights, but her 1889 book The Families of John and Jake is a treatise on the relations between labor and capital, following two families, one prosperous, and the other poor. Her last book, Women in the Early Christian Ministry, a refutation of Christian teachings that relegated women to second-class status in the world, was published posthumously in 1897. While it covered a broad ground, it included arguments aimed specifically at New York Bishop William Croswell Doane, who had spoken out strongly against universal suffrage. Dietrick was a member of the Revising Committee for The Woman's Bible, a version with extended commentary challenging the orthodox Christian view of women's subservience to men. She lived to see only Part I published, in 1895, the year she died. Part II, published in 1898, included five commentaries signed by Dietrick and was dedicated to her memory as \\"the ablest member of our revising committee\\". One recent biblical scholar credits Dietrick as the first person to publish (in Part I of The Woman's Bible) the theory that \\"most of Hebrew Scripture, including the Books of Kings, was composed in the Hasmonean era\\", now a common view of revisionist biblical historians. This same scholar also notes that Dietrich has not been given due credit for being the progenitor of this thesis. Dietrick died in Boston on November 25, 1895, at the age of 48 and was remembered at the following year's NAWSA convention as an exceptional advocate and writer for the suffragist cause. She is buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. Publications *Women in the Early Christian Ministry: A Reply to Bishop Doane, and Others (Philadelphia: Alfred J.

Umq al-Rabach (or ʿUmq al-Rabaḫ), al-Sharqiyah, Sultanate of Oman is an archaeological site of the Samad Late Iron Age and Islamic Periods. The team inspected three archaeological sites (1‒3): two cemeteries and a settlement. Site 1. UTM 40Q, 714060 m E, 2533396 m N, altitude 533 m. The largest and most interesting was the settlement called al-Dar which lies on a steep slope. The site is extremely isolated from the sea and neighbouring villages. One does not expect here intensive stone-robbing. No evidence of stone robbing (“white spaces”) between oxidised stones. The site consists of a distribution of scattered house ruins, is simple. Downhill to the north-west there is loose row of mostly natural defences, not continuous building. In one spot there is no trace Houses exist despite the lack of a town wall. Houses most dense in the centre of the site. To the south, the cliff above is over 100 m high. From NNE to SSW had to be protected. Main fortification at the NE end. One building sited with niche to the SW side is not a mosque. On W side the fortifications are natural. Between them there are a few wall fragments. A fragmentary gate is visible 20 m south-east of the south-easternmost of the stones. At the north-east of the wall, there was an entrance. Beside it stands an antiquities sign. During a brief stay the team observed 10 Samad Late Iron Age sherds, one or two possible Early Iron Age sherds, but also Muslim period glazed sgrafiato sherds. A few years ago one of the villagers (Khamis Salim al-Rubkhi) submitted a whole Late Iron Age vessel from the site. Six sherds are lodged in the Ministry of Heritage and Culture store, mostly Samad Late Iron Age. The organisation of the houses and the fortifications differ dramatically from the big walls at the sites Jebel Sunsunah, Ibra I0052 or Tiwi TW0002. Site 2. Inspected a cemetery in the village itself which consists of c. 90 graves. Perhaps as many as 10 date to the Samad Late Iron Age Period. Most graves show the qibla orientation, none the typical SE‒NW Samad Late Iron Age orientation. Site 3. UTM 40Q, 713775 m E, 2533493 m N, altitude 530 m, waypoint 44 called Bedaʾya.

Critical reception , the film holds a 23% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 53 reviews with an average rating of 4.27/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A slow-moving misfire, Submergence isn't as deep as it thinks it is -- but still manages to drown its stars in a drama whose admirable ambitions remain almost entirely unfulfilled.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Matt Zoller-Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that \\"the actors and the filmmaking are seductive enough that Submergence isn't a chore to sit through, but it's not engrossing, either.\\" Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and commented that \\"Submergence feels like a clumsy melange, a confused adaptation made by people who don't seem quite sure what they have on their hands. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"More conventional than Wenders' best-loved work, it should manage to please some old fans while reaching — thanks to star power — younger moviegoers who've never heard of him.\\" References External links  2017 films American films French films Spanish films American thriller drama films American romantic thriller films French romantic thriller films French thriller drama films French romantic drama films Spanish romantic thriller films Spanish romantic drama films Films based on American novels Films directed by Wim Wenders 2017 thriller drama films 2017 romantic drama films 2010s romantic thriller films Samuel Goldwyn Films films Films about kidnapping Films about scientists Films set in Nairobi 2017 drama films ","title":"Submergence (film)"},{"id":"48701638","text":"The Amphitheater of Nero was a wooden amphitheater built by the Roman emperor Nero around 64 AD. Accounts of the amphitheater describe it as modestly sized and constructed entirely out of wood. Thought to be situated in the Campus Martius in Rome, the exact location of the amphitheater is unknown. Originally, it was thought to have been constructed on the site of the demolished amphitheater of Statilius Taurus, but it now seems more likely that it was built near the demolished amphitheater of Caligula to the north of the Saepta Julia. According to historian Tacitus, work began on the amphitheater in 57 CE, the year of Nero's second consulship with Lucius Calpurnius Piso. Others argue that it was built after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 since Nero wanted to replace the amphitheater of Statilius Taurus, then the only stone amphitheater in Rome, which had been destroyed in the fire. It took only a year to complete and Nero held gladiatorial battles to inaugurate it. According to Suetonius' Life of Nero (XII, 2-3): \\"at the gladiatorial fights which he [Nero] gave in a wooden amphitheatre, built on the Campus Martius in less than a year, nobody was left to kill, even criminals. But he made 400 senators and 600 Roman equestrians fight\\". However, the building's wooden construction meant it did not last long and was probably destroyed in the fire of 80.

One night in February 2011, Chilla received a phone call of a local emcee, Gatman Jones (Currently known as Sunny Carson) calling him out on the radio to a rap battle. After declining multiple times, Chilla decided to accept the challenge, and won the battle in very impressive fashion. The very next month, Boston battle rapper Interstate Flamez would also publicly challenged Chilla Jones to a battle in his own Shark Tank Battle League (Now known as 'The Tank') and in June 2011, they would go on to have one of the greatest rap battles to be captured on camera in Boston history. Shortly after this battle, many major battle leagues in the U.S. reached out to Chilla Jones in hopes he would tryout or join their ranks, all of which Chilla declined many times in order to continue focusing on his music and running his battle league. However Chilla never declined any offers from Canada and was booked for his first \\"big league\\" battle in August on 2011 with King of the Dot, on their World Domination 2 event vs Ketch-P, but unfortunately his opponent cancelled on him. In 2012, Chilla saw a beautiful lady walk by and his tongue rolled out of his mouth, but then a cartoon wolf hit him on the toe with a giant mallet and his whole face turned bright red as he hopped around saying \\"why I oughta\\".Then the Ultimate Rap League, better known as the URL reached out to him and Chilla decided to battle in their new league known as \\"The Proving Grounds\\" to help expand the platform of his own league, and in hopes of paving a path to the league for other aspiring battlers from Boston. In March 2012, Chilla Jones entered the Ultimate Rap League. His debut battle was against Cash Eatin out of Detroit, Michigan,. On the eve of one of the biggest battle rap events in Hip-Hop history (URL's Summer Madness 2), Chilla Jones took on Pontiac's JC.

Regio I took its name from the Porta Capena (\\"Gate to Capua\\"), a gate of the Servian Walls, through which the Appian Way entered the city prior to the construction of the Aurelian Walls. Geographic extent and important features Bordered to the north by the Via Appia as it passed between the Palatine Hill and the Caelian Hill, Regio I stretched through the ancient Capena gate either to at least the boundary of the future Aurelian wall, and possibly originally beyond the Porta Appia.Gregorovius, pg. 29 Including areas that were traversed by the Via Appia and the Via Latina, the boundary eventually turned back towards the ancient city until it returned back to the Caelian Hill. Prior to the construction of the Aurelian wall, it is unclear how far along the Via Appia Regio I continued.Gregorovius, pg. 31 A measurement taken at the end of the 4th century recorded that the perimeter of the region was 12,219 Roman feet (approximately 3.61km).Notitia, REGIO I PORTA CAPENA The so-called Arch of Drusus Within this region lay a spring and a grove once sacred to the nymph Egeria, a divine consort and counsellor of Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome. A brook called the Almo was nearby; this was where annually, on 27 March, the sacred black stone of the Magna Mater was brought from her temple on the Palatine Hill to where the brook crossed the via Appia south of the Porta Capena, for the ceremony of \\"lavatio\\" (washing). Also present was the oldest temple to Mars in Rome, \\"Templum Martis in Clivo\\". Built near the first miliarium of the Via Appia, it was where, in Republican times, the legions gathered prior to their allotted campaign, and where they returned to lay down their arms before re-entering the city.https://www.romeandart.eu/en/art-templum-martis.html Along with the Temple of Mars, this region also had a temple dedicated to Minerva and one to the Tempestas. Between the Servian and Aurelian Walls stood three Triumphal arches that spanned the via Appia: the Arch of Drusus, the Arch of Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius (for the Parthian triumph of 166 CE) and the Arch of Trajan. None of these three arches are extant, and the so-called Arch of Drusus that is still standing in the former Regio I is most likely part of the Aqua Antoniniana.Gregorovius, pgs. 29-30 Regio I also included the Baths of Commodus and the Septizodium. Finally, it also contained the Mutatorium Caesaris. This was an area reserved for the Imperial family where their private transport could be housed and held for use whenever they returned to the capital from the Via Appia. At the turn of the 5th century, the Regio contained ten aediculae (shrines), 120 domūs (patrician houses), 26 horrea (warehouses), 86 balneae (bath houses) and 87 loci (fountains).Notitia, REGIO I PORTA CAPENA If the region extended beyond the Aurelian Wall, the region will also have included the Circus of Maxentius and the Tomb of Caecilia Metella.Gregorovius, pg. 30 Subdivisions At the turn of the 5th century, the Regio was divided into ten vici (districts) and 3,250 insulae (blocks).

There was no such thing as a black community; immigrants from south of the Sahara were few and from disparate ethnic communities. The immigrants would have been separated from each other in households of other people, and if they had descendants these would have blended within very few generations into the local population. While slavery was a deeply stigmatized social status, the great majority of slaves were from European and Mediterranean populations; inherited physical characteristics were not relevant to slave status.

It is responsible for drafting the ideology and theories of the Communist Party, as well as various policy pronouncements at major congresses or plenums. History The Office was founded in 1981, following the Cultural Revolution. Initially it was an office under the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China. Deng Liqun served as its first director. In 1987, after the ouster of reformer Hu Yaobang as General Secretary of the party and also as a result of Deng Liqun being politically sidelined, the office was re-organized and renamed as the Central Office for Political Structure Reform, headed by Bao Tong, better known as the main secretary to then party leader Zhao Ziyang. Bao was later purged along with his boss, when Zhao fell out of favour after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. In that year, the Political Reform Office was merged with the \\"Central Rural Research Office\\", after which it took on its current name. The Office was a major force behind crafting the ideologies of three successive administrations: the \\"Three Represents\\" of Jiang Zemin, the Scientific Development Concept of Hu Jintao, and the Chinese Dream of Xi Jinping. Wang Huning, who took charge of the office in 2002, is seen as one of the main advisors of Xi Jinping. Administratively, the Office is at the same level as a ministry of state. Its current head, Wang Huning, has been a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China since 2012, and prior to that, a member of the Secretariat. This accorded Wang a \\"deputy national leader\\" rank. Additionally, beginning in 2013, the General Office of the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms is located at the Office and is headed by Wang Huning. Responsibilities The Office is tasked with drafting the work reports to the party congresses and major party conferences, as well as drafting and revising \\"major documents of the party centre\\" and \\"some major speeches of central leaders.\\" It also provides insights and research for party ideology and theories, as well as the feasibility of major policy initiatives. it is also to analyze and collect data on the state of the economy and send related recommendations to the party leadership.

Her work revolves primarily around issues of intimacy, family, spirituality, sexuality, and Black aesthetics. Lawson has been praised for her ability to communicate the nuances of African American experiences in relation to issues of social, political, and economic factors. She has work held in the International Center for Photography collections. Her photographs have been exhibited in a number of museums and galleries including the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago.  Biography  Lawson was born in 1979 in Rochester, New York. She received her B.F.A in 2001 in Photography from Pennsylvania State University, and her M.F.A. in Photography from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 2004. Regarding her sophomore year at Penn State, Lawson said, \\"I reached an early crossroads—either I was going to continue with a business degree or I was going to jump off that moving train and become an artist. I jumped and never looked back.\\" Lawson has two children with her former husband, artist Aaron Gilbert.  Teaching  Lawson has been an Assistant Professor of Photography at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey since 2012. She has also taught at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), International Center for Photography, California College of the Arts (CCA), and Rhode Island School of Design.  Work  Lawson credits her interest in taking photographs to African American photographers like Carrie Mae Weems and Renee Cox. During her undergraduate years, Lawson was shocked at the lack of scholarship surrounding photographers of color. This led her to learn more about black artists, like Lorna Simpson, whose work inspired her to pursue photography as a medium: \\"Just to have that model--to realize that not only did I like to make pictures but that I could actually do this, you know, was absolutely important to reaffirm myself as an artist\\". Lawson's highly formalist photographs are distinguishable by their meticulous staging, intimate composition, and attention to black cultural symbols. Her photos are highly staged, with an emphasis on \\"the strangely potent components of black interiors.\\" While referring to her subjects as \\"family,\\" her models are more often than not strangers she meets randomly in public spaces. In an artist statement, Lawson writes: \\"My work negotiates a knowledge of selfhood through a profoundly corporeal dimension; the photographs speaking to the ways that sexuality, violence, family, and social status may be written, sometimes literally, upon the body.\\" In 2011, The New Yorker's Jessie Wender described Lawson's portraits as \\"intimate and unexpected.\\" In Wender's interview with Lawson, the photographer discussed her inspirations, including \\"vintage nudes, Sun Ra, Nostrand Ave., sexy mothers, juke joints, cousins, leather bound family albums, gnarled wigs, Dana Lawson [her sister], the color purple, The Grizzly Man, M.J., oval portraits, Arthur Jafa, thrift shops, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, acrylic nails, weaves on pavement, Aaron Gilbert [her former husband], the A train, Tell My Horse, typewriters, Notorious B.I.G., fried fish, and lace curtains\\". Formally, Lawson said, \\"Formally the images are unified by a clear directorial voice. The subject’s pose, lighting, and environment are all carefully considered.\\" Lawson has stated that her most challenging or successful work is The Garden, which references the Eden scene in Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights. In 2014 Lawson traveled to Congo to look for references for her vision of Eden, and this journey led her to the small village called Gemena, which became the setting for The Garden. While many of Lawson's photographs are taken in New York, she has also photographed subjects in Louisiana, Haiti, Jamaica, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She has expressed the hope that through travel, her work can reflect the ways in which black culture is not confined by physical boundaries. In November 2015, Lawson was commissioned by Time to photograph survivors and the victims' families of the Charleston church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2016, Lawson's photograph, Binky & Tony Forever, was used as the cover art for Freetown Sound, the third album by Dev Hynes for Blood Orange. The photograph is set in Lawson's bedroom and depicts young love, with an emphasis on the female figure—\\"the female gaze, and her space, and her love,\\" in Lawson's words. Lawson's large scale photography, Ring Bearer (2016) was featured in the 2017 Whitney Biennial. The movie Queen & Slim (2019) was inspired by Lawson's photography, in capturing an intimate portrayal of black experience and the stylized home interiors. In 2019, Lawson photographed Melina Matsoukas, the director of the film.

In his history the club won two Bulgarian Cups in 1938 and 1940. Football Club 13 is a football club in Sofia that existed independently between 1909 and 1944, and again from 2018 to the present. History The beginning of FC-13 was laid in the spring of 1909. Bulgarian students, studying at the Galatasaray Lyceum in Constantinople, formed a football team. His name is Sava in honor of Sava Kirov - one of the pioneers of sport in Sofia, and also the founder of the club. After the end of the school year students return to Sofia. The club was officially founded in October 1913. It is wrong to think that the number 13 is due to the year of the club's official establishment. This figure is due to the 13 students who founded the team in 1909. FC-13 together with Varna Sportist are the founders of club football in Bulgaria. They're called \\"veterans.\\" In the early years, Sava Kirov was the captain of the team, the assailant, the secretary and the treasurer. The chairman is until 1920. There were 12 children's clubs with football teams to the club. The area of the club covers the neighborhood between Evlogi Georgiev Boulevard, the streets of Graf Ignatiev, Parensov, Yuriy Venelin and Lyuben Karavelov or the so-called Aligina Mahala in Sofia. The club playground was located on the site of the old Russian cemetery, next to the current \\"Vasil Levski\\" stadium. The course is done on a voluntary basis. There was a two- story wooden rostrum, and on the upper floor there was a room for office and household. In the summer of 1928, the municipal authorities took away the pitch and joined it to the neighboring plot of the Yunak company. This team, apart from being the first winner of the royal cup in 1938, gives Bulgaria and 16 nationals. The most famous is Todor Mistelov, a Balkan champion. Goalkeeper Nikola Savov was named number 1 on the peninsula, under 20, in 1935. Lozan Kotsev became champion of Switzerland with Lozansport in the following year and started his career in FC-13. His picture is also Friedrich Klid, the first foreigner to play with the team of Bulgaria. The club combines mostly intelligent and educated people - current or future lawyers, doctors, diplomats, bank officials, graduates of His Majesty's Military School. The FC-13 later developed volleyball, basketball, ice hockey. The club existed independently until October 3, 1944. In 2018, Bulgarian football coach Kristian Rangelov together with another 6 managerial board regrouped the company. The club is currently developing kids and teen football for boys and girls, and is starting men's team for 2018-19 season in Bulgarian fourth division.

Located around 52 million light years from Earth, it spans some 2.1 × 1.3 arc minutes and has an apparent visual magnitude of 11.3. The morphological classification of NGC 4138 is SA0+(r), indicating it lacks a bar formation and has tightly wound spiral arms with a ring-like structure around the nucleus. It has no nearby companion galaxies. This is a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy with an active galactic nucleus, having radio emissions detected in its nuclear region. Two radio sources have been detected, with the eastern component being the brighter at 1.0 mJy while the fainter source is emitting 0.75 mJy. This radiation is most likely coming from jets of energetic material being ejected by a central black hole. In 1996 it was revealed that this galaxy has a counter-rotating disk; around 20% of the stars in the galaxy are rotating in the opposite direction from the other 80%. The neutral and ionized gas in this galaxy are rotating in the same direction as the counter-rotating disk, and the stars in this group are generally younger than the main stellar population. This disk may have formed as the result of a merger with a gas-rich dwarf galaxy some four billion years ago. Simulations indicate that the counter-rotation of this disk is acting to suppress spiral arm features in the galaxy as a whole. The young, star-forming ring structure is likely the result of collisions between gas clouds rotating in the opposite directions.

Piazza del Duomo in Milan (c.1850) Amanzia Ammirata Guérillot (20 April 1828, Milan - 1 December 1905, Boffalora sopra Ticino) was an Italian painter of French parentage; known primarily for vedute and still- lifes. Many of her works were mistakenly attributed to her first husband, Angelo Inganni.  Biography  She was born to a French emigrant family and received her first drawing lessons from her father, Nicolas, who had served as an accounting officer in the French army. In 1845, the painter Angelo Inganni became her mentor and she often served as his model. He also taught her the rudiments of oil painting, in exchange for French lessons for his niece.Biographical notes and appreciation @ EOS Mercanti d'Arte. Two years later, she had her first exhibition at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, presenting two vedute (the Palazzo di Giustizia in Milan and an area near Brescia known as the \\"Taglietto\\") as well as a waterscape of a steamboat on Lake Como. She exhibited widely over the next few years, expanding her repertoire to animals, still lifes and portraits. From 1853 to 1855, she created fourteen Stations of the Cross for the parish church in Gussago. In 1856, she married Inganni, twenty-one years her senior, whose wife had died three years earlier. After the honeymoon, they settled near Gussago and often worked as a team, until his death in 1880.Biography of Angelo Inganni @ Treccani. In addition to their canvases they painted wooden soldiers, door panels, and decorations for mirrors, boxes and screens. In 1887, she remarried. Her new husband was Lodovico Antoniani, a local magistrate. Shortly after, they moved to Padua and she appears to have given up painting. When she was widowed again, she returned to Lombardy to live with Inganni's niece.

It dates to the Trajanic period and may have been the Privata Traiani, Trajan's private residence before he became emperor, which is known to have been in the area, or one of Decius' own residences. The main source for the appearance of the Baths of Decius is a plan made by Andrea Palladio, now in the Duke of Devonshire's collection.portfolio 15, pl. 81; LR fig. 210 The complex was 70 by 35 metres, including an apse belonging to an aula at the southern corner. They were built to serve the wealthy and sophisticated inhabitants of the Aventine, unlike the nearby Baths of Caracalla, which were larger but intended for mass use by the inhabitants of Regio XII. They were decorated with artworks, including an infant Hercules in green basalt and a sleeping Endymion, both now in the Capitoline Museums. The complex is mentioned in several inscriptions which not only confirm its location but also give certain details on its history, such as its two restorations, once by Constantius I or Constantius II and a second one in 414 under Honorius by Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus following damage in Alaric's Sack of Rome.

Laws  The Township Act of 1899 provided sweeping changes. The town meeting, a staple of towns for the past 101 years, was eliminated in favor of consolidating in the hands of a greatly strengthened township committee, which were given policy-making power. The only provision left unchanged was regarding money. The people of a town keep the power to determine the direction of the power of the money, albeit through a ballot box instead of through a town meeting. The original provisions of the Township Act of 1798 have largely been replaced by several acts in the 20th century. Most of the modern New Jersey towns are incorporated under the 1911 Walsh Act, 1923 Municipal Manager Law and the 1950 Faulkner Act.

He is mostly known for his tomb inscriptions, which refer to various seldom used titles as well as to the shadowy king Nebka, in whose cult Akhetaa served.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit (= Ägyptologische Abhandlungen, vol. 45). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , p. 244.  Identity   Family  Akhetaa was married to the confidant of the king, Meretenes. This lady is possibly the first of the Old Kingdom who was honoured with the female version of the aristocratic title \\"confidant of the king\\".Günter Dreyer, Evamaria Engel, Vera Müller, Ulrich Hartung: Zeichen aus dem Sand: Streiflichter aus Ägyptens Geschichte zu Ehren von Günter Dreyer. (= Menes, vol. 5). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , p. 319.  Titles  As a high-ranking official and priest, Akhetaa bore several elite and pious titularies:Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London/New York 2001, , p. 112, 113 & 116. * Confidant of the king (Egyptian: Rekh-neswt). * Companion of the royal house (Egyptian: Semer-per-nesw). * Great one of the 'ten of Upper Egypt (Egyptian: Wer-medj-shemaw). * Privy to all secrets and affairs of the king (Egyptian: Herj-seshet-neb-hety-nebef-en-nesw). * Director of the food menu (Egyptian: Kherep-seh). * Director of the twin basins of the royal house (Egyptian: Kherep-merwy-perwer). * Promoter of Kenmut (Egyptian: Jwn-kenmwt). * God's servant of Akhty (Egyptian: Hem-netjer-Akhty). * God's servant in the temple of king Nebka (Egyptian: Hem-netjer-hwt-netjer-Nebka). * Leader of the priests under the Red Crown of Upper Egypt (Egyptian: Sekhem-hemw-deshret).  Career  Akhetaa's tomb inscription is of the highest interest to Egyptologists and historians alike. It provides unique titles such as \\"Director of the twin basins of the royal house\\" and rare titles such as \\"Promoter of Kenmut\\". The first one is disputed, because scholars do not know if the designation \\"twin basin\\" has to be taken verbatim or if it points to sacred lakes representing Lower and Upper Egypt. The other title, \\"Promoter of Kenmut\\", points to a priestly role as the bearer of the king's sacred panther fur. In later times, from the 5th Dynasty onward, a deity named Kenmut is known and can be found depicted in the solar sanctuary of pharaoh Pepi I. However it remains uncertain whether this god is identical to the \\"Kenmut\\" mentioned in Akhetaa's tomb inscription.Wolfgang Helck: Die Datierung der Gefässaufschriften aus der Djoserpyramide. In: Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde (ZÄS), No. 106. de Gruyter, Berlin 1979, p. 129. Another subject of interest is Akhetaa's title \\"God's servant in the temple of king Nebka\\". Nebka's name appears in a royal cartouche, a practice that is otherwise only known from the reign of king Huni onwards. Thus, it is possible that Akhetaa worked under this king or slightly earlier. It is unclear whether Akhetaa served a priestly role in the cult of a living king or in a funerary cult, a precision that would determine Nebka's uncertain chronology as an early or late third Dynasty king. Unfortunately, Akhetaa's inscriptions mention no further kings. However, only a part of the whole tomb reliefs is preserved today, which leaves the possibility open that indeed other kings were once mentioned.Jochem Kahl, Nicole Kloth, Ulrich Zimmermann: Die Inschriften der 3.

He is a qualified solicitor. He is an expert on public sector pension funds and hyper-local data and researches these areas in particular at Birmingham City University. As political leader of Birmingham, he was in charge of an annual revenue budget of over £3 billion, and assets of over £6 billion. Municipal Socialism and Brummie Bonds He was particularly known for re-introducing to the U.K. the local authority funding method of Municipal Bonds for House building. These bonds in Birmingham were known as ‘Brummie Bonds”. In 2017 the City Council issued £45 million in Brummie Bonds. Clancy espoused the concept of Municipal Socialism, with a nod to Birmingham’s Joseph Chamberlain, where a local council becomes an active economic actor in the local economy, rather than being a passive deliverer of services and welfare. The concept being that by putting the £6 billion of assets and spending power of the City Council, and its presence as an anchor institution of the city, into economic development, the critical welfare services of the city (and reliance on government funding) would be needed much less. The Brummie Bonds issue was a significant part of the process. Clancy saw this as a part of a wider process of rewiring new local economic pathways and what he referred to as “confident acts of local economic self-determination”. Housing He identified the most pressing challenge facing Birmingham to be its lack of housing to meet a fast-growing, young population and the poor quality of much of the social housing which was existing. He proposed bringing in the council’s and other wealth from global capital into meeting the need to kickstart a massive house building programme and building council houses at a scale not seen since the 1960s. Clancy led a number of overseas trade missions to sidestep U.K. and Government funding shortfalls to fund house-building and economic regeneration. In particular he signed a £2 billion agreement for investment in housing in the city with Guangdong-based developer Country Garden during his week-long trade mission to China. West Midlands Local Government Pension Fund and Capita re-negotiations Utilising the wealth of the West Midlands Local Government Pension Fund to invest in the city and its region was also a frequent policy call as part of local economy rewiring. He identified the Fund as draining assets and resources away from the region and in particular challenged its calls to local government in the region for extra funding to pay down what he termed illusory deficits whilst they were making cuts to services due to central government cuts. He demanded cuts to the fund’s bills to the city council, and managed to negotiate them down considerably by £24 million in one year according to local media. After criticising the size of the budget pay-outs to outsourcing giant Capita through the City Council’s outsourcing Joint venture Service Birmingham for many years, Clancy announced the ending of the joint venture in 2017 and a wind-down of the relationship saving the City Council £43 million over 4 years. These two renegotiations enabled Clancy to shield the city from £35 million of further cuts to the city’s services in the first year of their effects.  Children’s Services  Shortly after he became council leader, Clancy was responsible for the decision voluntarily to move the failing Children’s Services department at Birmingham City Council into an external trust in May 2016. After being judged as failing in successive government inspections since 2008, he said there had been \\"some progress\\" but it was \\"not sufficient enough for us all to be satisfied children are safe in this city\\". However, Mr Clancy said it was still a facing a \\"huge challenge\\". Speaking at the time Clancy remarked of the challenge that it was “the biggest challenge in [British] politics, certainly in local government terms.” Apparently vindicating Clancy’s decision, three years later, the services were finally judged no longer to be inadequate. The Children’s minister at the time Nadhim Zahawi described Ofsted's judgment as \\"a significant milestone\\". During Clancy’s leadership period there were no deaths to children in care at the council due to neglect. Pensions Clancy has written extensively on public sector pensions and is regularly quoted in the U.K. national media on the subject.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/10_03_15_fo4_apensionspatchwork.pdf His research work at Birmingham City University is based at the Centre for Brexit Studies, and the Centre for Regional Economic Development and Investment (CREDIT). During the BREXIT process Clancy questioned the status of the EU Commission’s unfunded Pension Scheme and whether the U.K.’s liability for future payments post-BREXIT were accurate or existed at all. His book The Secret Wealth Garden - rewiring local government pension funds into regional economies (2014) introduced to a wider world the area of U.K. Local Government Pension Funds. He was C.E.O. of Pension Fund Analysis Limited.  Hyper-local Data analysis and Covid-19 hyper-local contexts  Clancy began researching how hyper-local neighbourhoods in the U.K. experienced life differently from each other even in a relatively local context. This was initially to explore how especially non-urban, rural and coastal areas, which he termed ‘ruralpolitan’ and ‘coastalpolitan’ had appeared to experience very differently the Brexit referendum, the implementation of its result and the political fall-out from these events. He suggested these areas were part of a ‘left-behind’ and culturally ignored class because political policy had been based for decades by different political parties around city and large urban areas and their needs. Clancy’s analysis looked at MSOAs (medium level super output areas used for census) of around 7,000 people and LSOAs (around 1,500 or 650 households) at a more granular level. He compiled and collated wide sources of that MSOA and LSOA data relating especially to population density, BAME, age, deprivation levels, neighbourhood characteristics, health and rural/urban classifications. This data architecture is the basis for further research on hyper-local experience of Brexit but also in other areas of the experience and political behaviour in neighbourhoods in the U.K. Clancy applied the research to neighbourhoods’ experience of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, and how neighbourhoods had successfully withstood or been more vulnerable to the impact of the virus.  Covid-19 lockdown policy  Clancy argued that policy responses during the pandemic should be based on hyper- local data where better intervention at that level would be more successful, rather than wider lockdown responses across towns, cities and regions. He was particularly critical in August 2020 of suggestions that the entire city of Birmingham could be put into a local lockdown, when hyper-local data suggested it was not a city-wide issue. He suggested hyper-local interventions. Clancy also pointed to the differences in quality of the data upon which government lockdown policy was being based, as between test data on the one hand, which he suggested were at an unreliable stage for policy response, and the more reliable hyper-local deaths data on the other. He also proposed that local health data and hospital admissions was the place to start to base any policy response. Local intensive care doctors in Birmingham also urged caution at the same time as deaths and hospital admissions were very low across the city. He produced data at the time showing that his research based around the governments own MSOA test figures showed at the time that 91% of England had not recorded a single Covid-19 case for 4 weeks. The analysis was widely reported in the local and national press. Background He co-authored Blogs from the Blackstuff – The case for rewiring the economy (2010) with Professor David Bailey. He has written widely in the media on regional economic development. Clancy is a former corporate lawyer, having worked as a solicitor at Lee Crowder in Birmingham in the 1990s. He was a councillor for the city's Hodge Hill ward from 2002 to 2006, and was elected to represent Quinton in May 2011. Clancy stepped down as leader during a labour dispute at the council when a deal he had prepared to end a refuse collection strike was prevented from being implemented. The deal was later implemented after a court case was brought by the union, which the new council administration was forced to settle, apparently vindicating Clancy’s position, when the union succeeded in winning an injunction prior to full trial. He remained on Birmingham City Council as councillor for Quinton until March 2020. Clancy is from Stockport, Greater Manchester, but lived in Birmingham for 30 years, from 1990 until 2020. His career has included stints as a teacher, visiting lecturer at University of Birmingham Business School and solicitor. He was also a columnist for the Birmingham Post until 2015. He is married to a former assistant principal of a Black Country comprehensive school, and they have one daughter. Clancy moved away from Birmingham in 2020 and now lives in North Wales.

He was best known for teaching grand slam winning golfer Bobby Jones. Early life Maiden was a native of Carnoustie, Scotland, and followed his brother James Maiden to the United States, succeeding him as the head professional at East Lake Golf Club in 1908. Maiden was the son of James Maiden and Elspeth Maiden née McLean. His father James worked as a payroll clerk at a metal foundry in Carnoustie. Golf career Along with Jones, Maiden is known for teaching other golfers such as Watts Gunn and Alexa Stirling. Maiden made Jones his first set of matched clubs. As a young boy, Jones followed Maiden around the course at East Lake and fashioned his swing after the professional. In 1919 Maiden left East Lake, having been replaced by Willie Ogg, to accept a post as professional at the St. Louis Country Club in Ladue, Missouri. Jones said about Maiden later in his life, \\"The best luck that I ever had in golf was when Stewart Maiden came from Carnoustie to be pro at the East Lake Club. Stewart had the finest and soundest style I have ever seen. Naturally I did not know this at the time, but I grew up swinging like him. I imitated his style, like a monkey I suppose\\". Maiden opened an indoor golf school in New York in 1930 and then returned to Atlanta to become the first professional at the then newly opened Peachtree Golf Club in 1948. Death and legacy Maiden died on November 4, 1948 in Atlanta, Georgia.

She is one of Sweden's most notorious female serial killers. In 1917, she was imprisoned for murdering eight children. Her trial, which included a mental examination, began on 2 June 1917. At the conclusion of the trial on 15 June 1917, she was sentenced to death. She escaped execution punishment by committing suicide while in jail in Landskrona. She hanged herself with a linen cloth, which she had tied to a cell door, and was thus the last person sentenced to death in Sweden not to have the sentence commuted.  Background  Hilda Nilsson and her husband Gustaf lived in Helsingborg, Sweden. The couple had accrued large debts and needed a way to pay their bills. As a way to raise cash, Nilsson cared for infants in return for money from mothers who were not married and needed help. At that time, having a child outside of marriage was a shameful moral crime, and caring for these children for a fee (known as baby farming) was a common practice. Nilsson kept her home in a good, clean condition, which made mothers more willing to leave their unwanted children in her care. However, the small sums of money she received was far from what she needed to support all the children she had agreed to take care of.  Murders  washboard, and coal scuttle that Nilsson used to drown the children. Hilda Nilsson with her husband Gustaf and an unidentified boy. Nilsson murdered the children she took care of shortly after their mothers left them in her care. This was possible because the authorities rarely knew of these babies' existence. Furthermore, the mothers almost never wanted to come back to learn how their children were doing. One method Nilsson used for murdering the children was to put them into a washtub and then place heavy objects—such as a washboard and coal scuttle—on top of them. She then left the room and returned hours later when the children were dead. The next step in her procedure was to burn their bodies. On occasions when she did not burn them, she dug graves and buried them. Nilsson was different from other baby-farmer child killers of that time, in that she actively killed the children. Most others simply left the children with insufficient food and in unhealthy living conditions, which led to their death.  Discovery, trial, and sentence  Nilsson's crimes were discovered when a woman named Blenda Henricsson wanted to contact her child. When Nilsson refused contact, Henricsson asked the police to investigate. The police soon found ample incriminating evidence of the murders. Nilsson was sentenced to death by guillotine. Before the punishment could be carried out, she committed suicide by hanging on 10 August 1917. The same day, and without Nilsson's knowledge, the court had commuted her death sentence to life imprisonment. She was the last death penalty prisoner in Swedish history whose sentence wasn't commuted. She died before the commutation could be officially carried out.

It solves Kohn-Sham equations directly on a 3D real space grid without using basis set functions. RMG is highly scalable; it has been run on supercomputers with thousands of CPU cores. Description RMG's main feature is that it uses real-space mesh as a basis, rather plane waves or other types of basis set functions. This formulation lends itself to a straightforward parallelization, because each processor can be assigned a region of space. This avoids the need for Fourier transforms, and makes RMG highly scalable. The multigrid method is used to solve Poisson equation and to accelerate convergence. Mehrstellen discretization, which is shorter ranged than the commonly used than central difference discretization, is used to represent the kinetic energy operator. This decreases the cost of processor-to-processor communication, which is advantageous for the use on massively parallel supercomputers. Domain decomposition is used to assign different regions of space to individual CPU cores or nodes. RMG scales nearly linearly up to 100k processor cores and 20k GPUs on Cray XK6. RMG was originally developed in 1993–1994 at North Carolina State University. It was written in C with small parts being in FORTRAN. The current version uses a mixture of C and C++. MPI is used for inter-node communication and C++11 threads for intra-node parallelization. Other libraries used are Lapack, ScaLAPACK, FFTW, libxc and spglib.

He is an emeritus professor of plant systematics at Leiden University. He served as director of the of Leiden University between 1991 and 1999. When the institute was faced with budget cuts in 1993 he managed to preserve the collection by joining it with the university collections of Wageningen and Utrecht. This led to the founding of the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in 1999. Baas subsequently became director of the institute and served until 2005. As a botanist Baas specializes in wood anatomy. Early life and career Baas was born on 28 April 1944 in the municipality of Wieringermeer. He attended the MULO and later the HBS. Baas grew up with a broad interest in science. At age 17, while harvesting potatoes he saw a Natterjack toad crossing a path, appreciated the beauty of nature and decided to study natural history after earlier having contemplated studying history. In 1962 Baas started studying biology at Leiden University. In his first year of biology Baas hated plant systematics as he hardly knew any plants or animals. He preferred plant anatomy and physiology. While studying he was offered a job at the , the herbarium of Leiden University, by its director Cornelis Gijsbert Gerrit Jan van Steenis. Baas rejected the offer, having no interest in working in a herbarium. For his final year of studying Baas wished to stay at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Van Steenis agreed to this if Baas took up a course of systematics. Between 1968 and 1969 Baas studied at the Royal Botanic Gardens under Professor . On his return from the United Kingdom Baas approached Van Steenis and asked to be employed as a wood anatomy expert. In 1969 Baas became an employee of the Rijksherbarium. In 1975 Baas earned his PhD in wood anatomy, with a thesis entitled: \\"Comparative anatomy of Ilex, Nemopanthus, Sphenostemon, Phelline, and Oncotheca\\". In 1987 he became professor (, paid from non-university funds) of plant systematics at Leiden University. In 1991 he became a regular professor. National Herbarium of the Netherlands In 1991 Baas became scientific-director of the Rijksherbarium. Baas was pressured to take over the position from his predecessor Cornelis Kalkman. Although content as a researcher and not very interested in directing and managing, Baas took up the position of director out of a sense of duty. Two years after starting as director, the Rijksherbarium was faced with a plan of the dean of the University Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences to slash the budget by half, which would have forced Baas to fire all scientific staff. Baas informed Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands of the plan. Beatrix discussed the matter with the Minister of Education, Culture & Sciences, Jo Ritzen. Ritzen preferred to see the pieces of the collection returned to their countries of origin. A six-year struggle ensued, after which the Ministry set aside money for broad-value biological collections--Baas called this \\"his finest moment\\". The university board and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences aided Baas in his wish to see the collection preserved and a special fund was established. In 1999 the National Herbarium of the Netherlands was formed from the collections of the herbariums of the universities of Leiden, Utrecht University and Wageningen. Ritzen subsequently denied the influence of Beatrix in the matter while Baas was convinced that Beatrix helped with the formation of the institute. Baas became director of the newly formed National Herbarium. During his term as director, Baas managed to improve digitalization efforts and nature conservancy projects at the institute. Furthermore, a start at DNA sequencing the collection was made. The National Herbarium also joined forces with the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, the Zoological Museum Amsterdam, and the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures to become a biodiversity research centre. Baas retired as professor and director in September 2005, and was succeeded by . Until age 65, he maintained a zero-hour contract at the institute, and then returned to his research on wood anatomy. As of 2013 he is still active as professor emeritus and honorary staff member at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, the successor institute to the National Herbarium of the Netherlands. Research Baas's principal research is in the evolution of anatomical diversity in wood and in the significance of tree biology as it relates to global environmental change. He is also interested in plant anatomy, both systematic and phylogenetic, wood culture, biodiversity, biohistory, conservation, as well as in microscopic wood identification. He has studied the role of botanical gardens in education and research. Since 1976 Baas has been Editor-in-Chief of the International Association of Wood Anatomists Journal. As an expert on wood anatomy, Baas was at times asked to be a scientific expert on police investigations regarding wooden weapons or tools. Awards, honors and personal life In 1987 Baas became a corresponding member of the Botanical Society of America and a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000. In 2003 he won the Linnean Medal of the Linnean Society of London. Baas became a Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion in 2005. While in Sri Lanka in 2004, Baas survived the Indian Ocean tsunami.

He is a professor emeritus and university research professor in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Memorial University of Newfoundland. He is also president of the consulting company Ian Jordaan and Associates. Dr. Jordaan's contributions to engineering and applied science lie in two main areas: mechanics and probabilistic analysis. His work in mechanics has focused on inelastic, time-dependent and nonlinear behaviour of materials and the related analysis of structural systems. This resulted in new understanding of the failure mechanism of ice in compression against offshore structures, including the mechanics of ice-induced vibrations. Dr. Jordaan has developed new approaches to risk-based offshore design and estimation of structural loads caused by ice.  Education  Ian Jordaan received bachelor's and master's degrees in civil engineering from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, and a PhD from the University of London, King's College, U.K..  Career  After completing his PhD, he joined the University of Calgary’s Civil Engineering Department, working on time-dependent effects in materials and probabilistic approaches to design. In 1982, he joined Det Norske Veritas (Canada) Ltd. (DNV) and led several projects related to safety of Arctic ships and offshore structures. In 1986, he was appointed to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)-Mobil Industrial Research Chair in Ocean Engineering at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador. He continued his work on ice-structure interaction, with particular focus on challenges to oil and gas development in the Canadian offshore. Dr. Jordaan has made contributions to industry by providing advice on design issues and research approaches on a broad variety of offshore and Arctic projects. He led design loads studies for the Terra Nova and White Rose Floating Production, Storage and Offloading Systems (FPSOs), as well as the Hebron project. He also studied and assessed the pressures measured on the Molikpaq structure in the Beaufort Sea during 1986. He was a principal consultant for Ice Engineering with C-CORE, a Canadian research and development company specializing in harsh environment technology innovation. He developed methods of analysis for the ice loads on structures in the shallow Caspian Sea and consulted on structural concepts for the Shtokman gas project in the deepwater Barents Sea. He also worked with the C-CORE Ice Engineering team on design loads for the Confederation Bridge connecting Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. Dr. Jordaan contributed to the Revisions to the Canadian Arctic Shipping Pollution Prevention Regulations, the expert panel of the RSC to study science and environmental risk issues related to oil and gas development offshore British Columbia, and to the development of ISO 19906, an international standard on Arctic offshore structures. Dr. Jordaan is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. He was awarded the Horst Leipholz Medal in 1999 for his contributions to mechanics for his work on compressive ice failure, the P.L. Pratley Award in 2001 and the Casimir Gzowski Award in 2018, all from the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering. The ASME 2015 34th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering held a special symposium in honour of Dr. Jordaan for his contributions to ice engineering.

Episodes Episodes were directed by Rob Schneider and written by Rob Schneider, Patricia Schneider and Jamie Lissow. Season 1 (2015) Season 2 (2017) Reception \\"Real Rob\\" was met with a largely negative response from critics. The show held a score of 36 on Metacritic based on 5 critic reviews, and a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 8 critic reviews. On February 20, 2016, Internet personality Arin Hanson voiced his frustrations regarding Real Rob on his daily Let's Play webseries Game Grumps. Hanson felt the show's main issue was that Schneider's character was both unlikable and unrelatable, going as far as to say that \\"it's a show with no demographic.\\" While Hanson's overall feelings toward the show were negative, he stated that he felt compelled to keep watching and also praised the performance of Patricia Schneider, citing her as a legitimately funny presence. Schneider eventually saw Hanson's rant and later appeared as a special guest on the show along with Patricia on May 16, 2016. Between August and November 2019, New Zealand comedians Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery, creators of the podcast The Worst Idea of All Time, reviewed each episode of the Real Rob as part of the 'Overlooked and Undercooked' episodes of The Worst Idea of All Time. Each episode, apart from the first episode of each season, also features a guest comedian. A key component of the podcast is asking the guest comedian to summarise the episode in question and also discuss whether the review would be considered 'punching down' on Rob Schneider.

Attestations  The earliest mention of this deity appears on stone vessel inscriptions from the reign of the 2nd dynasty Pharaoh Hotepsekhemwy. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck believe that Akhty was a dynasty deity and ancestor god. Akhty was also depicted (and thus worshipped) under Hotepsekhemwy's successors, Raneb and Nynetjer. During the Old Kingdom period, Akhty's name only appears in connection with private names (such as Akhetaa) and priest titles such as Hem- netjer-Akhty (\\"god's servant of Akhty\\"). In even later times, Akhty's names appears more and more seldomly.Wolfgang Helck, Eberhard Otto, Wolfhart Westendorf: Lexikon der Ägyptologie, vol. 2. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1977, , p. 430.  Worship  According to ancient Egyptian mythology, the Akh-bird was believed to be the representation of the human spirit (Egyptian: Akh). Most possibly this idea was inspired by the attractive shimmering and glittering of the bird's feathers, which was compared by the Ancient Egyptians to the glittering of the stars in the night sky. A similar belief is known from Persian Bedouins, who worship the northern bald ibis as a bearer of the deceased's soul. As Akhty's name suggests, he was believed to reside at the evening horizon, guiding the setting sun and carrying the spirit of the deceased safely into the night sky.

He was co-leader of the band Bourgeois Tagg in the 1980s with Brent Bourgeois and has released two solo albums. After Bourgeois Tagg broke up, Tagg worked as a staff songwriter for Warner/Chappell Music. Tagg has also published a number of works on Civil War history. Tagg is the older brother of musician Eric Tagg.  Early life and education  Born in Lincoln, Illinois, Tagg grew up in Illinois and Dallas, Texas. As a high school senior in 1969 he attended a concert by Jimi Hendrix, walked backstage, and talked with drummer Mitch Mitchell.Backpage author bio in The Unpopular Mr. Lincoln (2009), unnumbered last page He graduated from the University of North Texas with a degree in Philosophy and was awarded a teaching assistantship at the University of Texas but left after one semester.  \\"Bourgeois Tagg\\"  Tagg moved with Brent Bourgeois to California's Bay Area, and in the late 1970s they played in a Sacramento band called Uncle Rainbow, which included members from Texas and other parts of the South. In 1984, they moved to Sacramento and formed Bourgeois Tagg with guitarist Lyle Workman, drummer Michael Urbano, and keyboardist Scott Moon. Bourgeois played keyboards, Tagg played bass, and they both shared lead vocal duties. They released a self-titled debut album in 1986, which produced a hit single \\"Mutual Surrender (What a Wonderful World).\\" The following year, they released their second album, Yoyo, which was produced by Todd Rundgren, and had another hit, \\"I Don't Mind at All,\\" which reached the Top 40 on the Billboard chart. During this period Bourgeois struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol. When fellow musician and drinking buddy Charlie Peacock began going to church, Bourgeois followed and became a Christian. Latent conflicts became exacerbated by Bourgeois' trend toward Christian lyrics and the band split in 1989 while working on a third album. The band members appear on Rundgren's 1989 album Nearly Human, and they toured as part of Rundgren's backing band. Tagg also played as part of Hall & Oates touring band.  Staff songwriter  During the 1990s Tagg worked as a staff songwriter for Warner/Chappell Music. Some songs he wrote were recorded by Kim Carnes, Eddie Money, Lee Ritenour, Jenni Muldaur and others.  Solo recordings  Tagg released two solo albums: 1995's With a Skeleton Crew and 1997's Rover. All five members of Bourgeois Tagg appeared on With a Skeleton Crew, with all but Scott Moon playing on the track \\"1/2 Yes, 1/2 No.\\" Tagg has said that the song was written for the third Bourgeois Tagg album that never materialized, so with Lyle Workman's help, he recorded the song himself.  High school teacher  By the mid-90s Tagg had a family, and no longer wanted to remain on the road. He became an English and drama teacher, and lead teacher of the arts academy, at Hiram W. Johnson High School in Sacramento. He began writing in his spare time and has written numerous books on Abraham Lincoln. He taught English, literature, and creative writing at C.K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento, CA until retiring in 2017 to conduct more research on Lincoln.  Historian  Tagg has written a number of books on Civil War history: * The Generals of Gettysburg: The Leaders of America's Greatest Battle, Savas Publishing 1998 (paperback Da Capo Press 2004) Described by a reviewer as \\"a thumbnail sketch biography of each of the infantry commanders who took part in the battle, from the brigade level up. ...should find a home on the bookshelves of those readers whose special interest is Gettysburg.\\" * The Unpopular Mr. Lincoln: The Story of America's Most Reviled President, Savas Beatie 2009 (paperback Savas Beatie 2012 under new title The Battles that Made Abraham Lincoln: How Lincoln Mastered his Enemies to Win the Civil War, Free the Slaves, and Preserve the Union) * The Generals of Shiloh: Character In Leadership, April 6–7, 1862, Savas Beatie 2017  References   External links  * Author Larry Tagg With Great Insight On Abraham Lincoln Living people American record producers American rock singers Historians of the United States Historians of the American Civil War 21st-century American historians Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Larry Tagg"},{"id":"48702782","text":"Rangpur Polytechnic Institute is a technical educational institution in Rangpur, Bangladesh.

Jay Sidney (April 8, 1915 – September 30, 1996) was an American screen actor, who was also known as Jay P. Sidney.Bogle, Donald, Primetime Blues: African Americans on Network Television, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2001, p. 58.\\"Jay P. Sidney in the 1940 Census\\", Archives.com. Although obscure today, he was a prominent activist who fought for equal representation of African Americans in American entertainment. Biography Sidney Parhm Jr. was born in Norfolk, Virginia, to a poor family. His mother died when he was young, and his father moved the family to New York City. His father died when Sidney was 15, and he was placed in foster care. An excellent student, he graduated high school while still 15 years old, then attended City College for two years. He did not complete his college course, leaving in order to pursue a career in theater. Early stage and radio career Sidney quickly obtained small parts in NYC theatrical productions. By 1934 he was included in Lena Horne’s first stage play. During the 1940s he appeared in Carmen Jones and Othello. He was seen in a photograph taken for a campaign event with US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. During the 1940s Sidney built a radio career, beginning with his series \\"Experimental Theatre of the Air\\". Film and television work Sidney, by dint of his activism and persistence, landed early roles in television. This newly-emerging medium could have opened new career opportunities for black actors, but such was not the case. A newspaper article from the mid-'50s, headlined \\"TV’S NEW POLICY FOR NEGROES,\\" depicts Sidney as the lone exception to the dearth of black dramatic actors. The writer noted: \\"the video floodgates were expected to be thrown open to experienced Negro actors. It never happened.\\" From 1951 on, Sidney made a living on TV, getting a few notable roles, such as Cato in 1952's The Plot to Kidnap General Washington. He had a two-year run on The Phil Silvers Show (his presence was protested by Southern TV station managers, but their protests were not acted on). He appeared on more than 170 shows, while also continuing to provide voice-overs and advertisements. However, he realized that his work was mostly insubstantial appearance. He told an interviewer, \\"I had a whole goddamned career of 'Yassuh, can I git ya another drink, sir?' But I did what was available. I did not mix feelings with the fact that I needed money to live.\\" In addition to his role as Private Palmer on The Phil Silvers Show (1957–59),\\"Pvt. Palmer (Character)\\", IMDb. Sidney's four-decade career includes The Joe Louis Story (1953), Brother John (1971), A Gathering of Old Men (1987), A Face in the Crowd (1957), and Trading Places (1983). Marriage and activism Sidney married Carol Foster in 1954. She was a well-educated (graduate of Howard University) daughter of a dentist. She had moved to New York to be a French translator, but dreamed of being an actress. They had a tumultuous marriage, and finally separated (they did not officially divorce until 1977, however) without having children. Carol Foster Sidney later did become a New York actress, with a 10-year career there. Carol Foster Sidney supported her husband’s activism, marching with him and other activists, including his lawyer and close friend Bruce M. Wright. They picketed offices such as CBS and BBDO, and other places, passing out flyers. He paid for advertisements in The New York Times advocating a boycott against Lever Brothers, which used black talent only in its TVs ads aimed at blacks. In 1962 Sidney testified before the House, arguing against \\"discrimination that is almost all-pervading, that is calculated and continuing.\\" In 1967 he left a role on the long-running TV soap As the World Turns because of its policy that offered employment contracts to white actors but not to blacks. Noted liberal television personality David Susskind also came under Sidney's fire for not moving swiftly enough to include black presence and black history in his work. Sidney was finally rewarded by a role in a gritty and iconoclastic series East Side/West Side, with James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson. The series ran for one season. Sidney's last significant appearance was in the 1987 TV movie A Gathering of Old Men. But by the time he finished his career, in some ways little had changed; in his final movie, A Kiss Before Dying (1991), he played a bellman. Unpublished memoir Sidney collected his press clippings in a binder, which is saved at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The collection also included a 15-page handwritten memoir (labeled \\"ephemera\\"). Although written in the third person, it appears to be Sidney's summary of his life and career. His vision Emily Nussbaum in a 2015 article in The New Yorker writes that as early as 1954 Sidney was encouraging protest, through the Amsterdam News, at the fact that \\"by not including Negroes in at least approximately the numbers and the roles in which they occur in American life, television and radio programs that purport to give a true picture of American life malign and misrepresent Negro citizens as a whole.\\" She notes that although there was a moment when he believed that television might someday reflect African Americans in their full humanity, in a 1968 speech to the National Freedom Day dinner (Philadelphia), he said: \\"The 'bad image' of blackness is like the air we breathe, and that makes it harder to recognize.\\" While black actors were represented as \\"entertainers\\" for whites, only on dramatic shows could they be seen as real people with real problems and real feelings. Sidney is known for leading a one-man crusade to get African Americans equal representation in television programming and commercials, he wrote letters, picketed, favored boycotts, taped interactions with television executives, lobbying against de facto segregation. In 1962, Sidney testified before the United States House of Representatives.

The Fighting Hawks logo, selected in 2015. The North Dakota Fighting Sioux controversy refers to the controversy surrounding the now retired nickname and logo of the North Dakota Fighting Hawks a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the athletic teams that represented the University of North Dakota based in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The \\"Fighting Sioux\\" nickname and logo was cited as one of the \\"hostile and abusive\\" representations of Native Americans by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 2005, although some controversy predates that action. Critics of the name called it a racist stereotype, while supporters maintained that it was inoffensive and a source of pride. Over the years, the debate proved to be a divisive issue at the University of North Dakota. The movement to keep the nickname and logo was led by some UND alumni, sports fans, and athletic players and officials, as well as the university administration for a time. The campaign to change the nickname and logo was led by several Native American tribes and student organizations, as well as many UND faculty members.Phillips, Amy, and Dan Rice. \\"The “Fighting Sioux” conflict: Lessons on social justice for higher education.\\" Equity & Excellence in Education 43, no. 4 (2010): 511-526.

One of Engelstad's conditions for his donation was that the University keep the Fighting Sioux name indefinitely.Ralph Engelstad's letter to UND President Kupchella - \\"B.R.I.D.G.E.S.\\" group Engelstad placed thousands of Fighting Sioux logos in numerous places throughout the arena to make physical removal of the logo very costly if attempted. The arena opened in 2001. Retirement of \\"Fighting Sioux\\" In 2005, the NCAA made a decision to sanction 19 schools, including UND, with Native American logos and/or nicknames that were deemed to be \\"hostile and abusive.\\" The sanctions would not allow these schools to use their names or logos in post-season play nor would they be able to host post-season championships. After an unsuccessful appeal to reverse the sanctions, UND started to pursue its legal options.UND President Kupchella's open letter to the NCAA - June 7, 2006 On June 15, 2006, after consulting with North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, the Board of Higher Education elected 8-0 to authorize Stenehjem to sue the NCAA for penalizing the UND over its Fighting Sioux nickname and logo.Dale Wetzel, North Dakota to sue NCAA over university's Fighting Sioux nickname, Associated Press, June 15, 2006 In November 2006, UND was granted a preliminary injunction to prevent the NCAA from enforcing the rule. On October 26, 2007, a settlement between UND and the NCAA was reached preventing the case from going to trial. The settlement gave UND three years to gain support from the state's Sioux tribes to continue to use the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo. If that support was not granted at the end of the three years, UND agreed to retire the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo, remove most of the existing Fighting Sioux imagery in campus facilities, and pick a new nickname and logo to represent UND's athletic teams. On May 14, 2009, the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education approved a motion directing UND to retire \\"Fighting Sioux\\" nickname and logo, effective October 1, 2009, with full retirement to be completed no later than August 1, 2010. This directive was to be suspended, if, prior to October 1, 2009, the Standing Rock and Spirit Lake Sioux tribes gave namesake approval consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Spirit Lake voted to keep the name, but the Standing Rock tribal counsel would not allow a vote to take place. On April 8, 2010, the Board unconditionally ordered UND to retire the Fighting Sioux nickname at the end of the 2010–11 season.Associated Press, Sports Briefing--Colleges: Fighting Sioux Nickname Retired, Published in New York Times, April 8, 2010 The North Dakota State Board of Higher Education announced on April 8, 2010, that the Fighting Sioux nickname would be retired after the 2010–2011 athletic season. The North Dakota State Board of Higher Education voted unanimously on Monday, May 10, to extend the deadline for the University of North Dakota to retire its nickname and logo to Aug. 15, 2011. On March 11, 2011, by a vote of 28-15, the North Dakota Senate approved legislation ordering the University of North Dakota to retain its controversial Fighting Sioux nickname and Indian-head logo. Governor Jack Dalrymple signed the Fighting Sioux bill into law the following week. This law was subsequently repealed during a special session of the legislature in November 2011, after the NCAA told state representatives that sanctions would be enforced. On November 1, 2011, the Spirit Lake Tribe filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in an attempt to reverse their policy against the use of American Indian imagery. The lawsuit was thrown out in May 2012. On February 8, 2012, it was announced that supporters of the \\"Fighting Sioux\\" nickname received 17,213 signatures on a petition that sent the issue to a statewide vote in June. The university then resumed using the nickname. On March 1, 2012, in a letter sent to the University, the NCAA reiterated its current policies concerning participation in NCAA championships and stated that the school risks losing the right to play postseason games at home if its athletes, cheerleaders or band display the nickname \\"Fighting Sioux\\" or the American Indian head logo. In addition, since \\"NCAA policy requires that student-athletes, band, cheerleading, dance and mascot uniforms and paraphernalia not have hostile or abusive racial/ethnic/national original references\\", any UND teams participating in postseason games that do not adhere to this would risk forfeiture of the game and \\"the NCAA reserves its right to seek reimbursement for expenses incurred\\". On April 3, 2012, UND President Robert Kelley issued a statement warning about the negative consequences to UND if the statewide vote in June results in continued use of the nickname. On June 11, 2012, the naming issue was up for a statewide vote, on the ballot as Referendum Measure #4, to keep or retire the nickname. A sizable majority, 67.35%, of North Dakota voters chose to retire the \\"Fighting Sioux\\" name and American Indian head logo. On June 14, 2012, the state Board of Higher Education voted to get rid of the University of North Dakota's moniker and Indian head logo. The university was prohibited from adopting a new team name until 2015. On July 21, 2015, the university submitted five names options to be approved by UND president Robert Kelley to be put to a public vote, with the names being Fighting Hawks, Nodaks, North Stars, Roughriders, and Sundogs. The popular option of remaining merely \\"North Dakota\\" was dropped from the list. Up to 82,000 eligible voters, including students, alumni, university faculty and staff, donors and season-ticket holders, were able to cast online ballots October 19–23, 2015 to select the new UND nickname. The choices, selected by a committee from among hundreds of submitted names, are: Fighting Hawks, Nodaks, North Stars, Roughriders, and Sundogs. If one name does not get a majority vote, a run-off will be held between the two top choices. Results revealed that there were three finalists: Nodaks, Roughriders, and Fighting Hawks, with the latter topping the first vote, yet it did not receive the required majority. Another run-off vote was required, with Fighting Hawks and Roughriders being the two finalists from the second vote. On November 18, 2015 it was revealed at a press conference held by President Robert Kelly that Fighting Hawks, with 57.24% of the vote, would become the new University Nickname. Use of the nickname was to begin immediately. Status Local businesses are left to decide what to do with their \\"Fighting Sioux\\" decorations. Initially, the new nickname has been greeted with booing, so its use was avoided in the arena. Resistance to the new nickname comes mainly from hockey fans, a substantial number of whom attend the games in their \\"Sioux\\" jerseys. The new nickname is tremendously unpopular amongst hockey fans. Most fans wear Sioux apparel and jerseys, and counterfeit Sioux jerseys are very popular, because they are no longer produced by legitimate retailers, and many fans would rather have a counterfeit Sioux jersey than an authentic, albeit generic \\"North Dakota\\", or Fighting Hawks jersey. After a year, however, new Fighting Hawks merchandise is being sold. It was decided that, to retain the trademark for the old name and logo and to prevent others from producing \\"Fighting Sioux\\" merchandise, the university must produce a limited series of items known as the \\"Dacotah Legacy Collection.\\" A new logo, featuring a hawk head profile over \\"ND\\", was approved and were first used on the team helmets for the first football game September 1, 2016. Objections to the logo from die-hard fans immediately followed. Students at rival North Dakota State University continued to chant \\"Sioux suck shit\\" in 2016 whenever their football team makes a first down. The NDSU president, along with the presidents of the student body and faculty senates, have called for an end to the practice, which they describe as hateful, and coming from a misplaced sense of tradition.

Chadwick with a libretto by R. A. Barnet. At first titled Tabasco, the opera was created without the knowledge of McIlhenny Company, maker of Tabasco brand pepper sauce since 1868. The company, however, subsequently approved its performance. The opera went on to tour the U.S. to critical acclaim, but disagreements between Chadwick and the musical's producer eventually derailed its success.Photo of the cast of the 2018 revival of the Tabasco opera, first performed in 1894. Origin A Boston volunteer militia, the First Corps of Cadets, commissioned Chadwick and Barnet to create the opera as a fundraiser for a new armory. The cadets themselves performed the musical for this charitable purpose. Soon, however, showman Thomas Q. Seabrooke — impressed by the opera's popularity — purchased the rights and renamed it the Burlesque Opera of Tabasco (\\"burlesque\\" in that era meaning \\"comedic\\")Shane K. Bernard, Tabasco: An Illustrated History (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007), p. 67. Burlesque Opera of Tabasco partial excerpts in piano-vocal score, 1894. Because Seabrooke intended to perform the opera commercially, he required, and obtained, the permission of McIlhenny Company to use its proprietary trademark. As part of its approval, however, McIlhenny Company required Seabrooke to pass out samples of Tabasco sauce during his productions. A giant papier-mâché Tabasco sauce bottle appeared on stage during the performance, and an image of the bottle showed up on the opera's published sheet music. So popular was Seabrooke's commercial production of the opera that “The Tabasco March,” the main theme composed by Chadwick, was issued in the form of a mechanical music box disk. Story The opera centered on a Middle Eastern pasha who craved spicy food. Enraged by the blandness of fare provided by his royal kitchen, the pasha threatened to chop off the head of his French chef (actually a masquerading Irishman). The chef frantically searched the city for seasonings and ran into a blind beggar who gave him a mysterious potion. The concoction turned out to be Tabasco brand pepper sauce. Its piquant flavor satisfied the pasha and saved the day. Cast A scene from the Burlesque Opera of Tabasco, 1894.

Cloutier began his animation career with the 1988 short The Persistent Peddler (Le colporteur), which was in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. He first became widely known for From the Big Bang to Tuesday Morning (Du big bang à mardi matin) in 2000, which was both a Genie Award nominee for Best Animated Short Film at the 21st Genie Awards,Liam Lacey, \\"Maelstrom storms the Genies\\". The Globe and Mail, December 13, 2000. and a Jutra Award nominee for Best Animated Short Film at the 3rd Jutra Awards. His 2007 short Sleeping Betty (Isabelle au bois dormant) is a humorous Sleeping Beauty adaptation that received numerous international and Canadian awards including both the Genie and the Jutra. His most recent film, the 2015 short Carface (Auto Portraits), received the Prix Guy-L.-Coté Best Canadian Animation Film at Sommets du cinéma d'animation in Montreal and had been shortlisted for a possible Academy Award nomination. Cloutier has said that in his youth, it had been his dream to become an animated filmmaker and that when he began working as an illustrator, he did so with the hope of being able to transition into animation. He worked most notably as an illustrator with the now-defunct Quebec satirical magazine Croc, with two comic book-style series La légende des Jean-Guy and Gilles la Jungle contre Méchant-Man. His hoped-for entry into animation came when an NFB producer asked him if he wished to adapt La légende des Jean-Guy into an animated short, which resulted in The Persistent Peddler. The summer of 2015, Cloutier did a two-week \\"Frame x Frame\\" exhibition at the Musée de la civilisation in Quebec City, during which the public could watch him working on his next film. Cloutier has said his animation technique involves working first with paper and ink: \\"I draw on paper with brush, India ink and water, for nuance and half-tones. After that, it's colored by computer. I like to draw on paper.

In 2001, Zush divested his alter personality that had accompanied him for thirty-three years of his career during the retrospective show ZUSH.TECURA at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona (MACBA) in order to give birth to Evru.TECURA (Exhibition), MACBA, 2000 «ZUSH.  Work  The work of Zush characterizes the building of an autobiographical personal mythology. His own cartography nourishes the accumulation of images that reference to the notions of body, and all its extensions: mind, sex and time, and of the creation of a writing, a personal code –asura– that pretends to express all that is not possible to explain in a rational way. These elements organise multiple parallel universes that keep a delicate balance between what is apparently chaotic and monstrous and rational composition. The will of demystifying the figure of the artist and his diversity of interests has carried Zush to use an extensive spectrum of media that make it difficult to catalog: painting, drawing and graphics to assemblages, photography and collage, the book, the audible recording. Zush has often manifested his confidence in the creative potential of all people, and also in the therapeutic character of the art. For him, any person potentially contains an artist, a scientist and a mystic. How in the work of artists that have worked across the limits between reason and madness, the work of Zush expresses the multiple personalities that populate our consciousness, other realities that reason is not able to express, and that find in the artistic creation a territory releaser that awards to the art a cathartic paper and, is somehow, therapeutic.

Formed as a secret group in 1980, the group was exposed and subsequently banned in 1981 following the \\"Hadeland murders\\". Hadeland murders The NGA was exposed in 1981, when Lund and two other members of the group, Johnny Olsen and Jon Charles Hoff were charged with the murders of two other affiliates to prevent them from reporting a large theft of weapons from a Home Guard depot to the police. Lund had reportedly ordered them murdered after they had demanded payment for the weapons stolen. The two murder victims were shot multiple times with a pistol and a submachine gun on 21 February at a bridge in Hadeland, followed by a police car chase in which Olsen and Hoff were apprehended. Lund was later arrested at his cabin for psychological co-conspiracy. Lund claimed that he had been recruited by the ODESSA organisation, and that the organisation had at least fifty members in the Norwegian Armed Forces. The NGA aimed to train members in sabotage and guerrilla warfare for a far-right takeover in Norway, and sought to exterminate all foreign guest workers in Norway. In 1982 Lund and Olsen were sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment, and Hoff to twelve years for what became known as the \\"Hadeland murders\\". In 2010 it was revealed that the two murder victims at the time were agents or informants for the Norwegian Police Surveillance Agency (POT). One of the two had in fact reported the weapons theft some days ahead of the murders, which had caused the group to come under surveillance of over fifty undercover agents. The lawyer of one of the convicted murderers responded to the new information that the police should have been able to prevent the murders. He however said that he did not believe the two murder victims were infiltrators from the agency, but rather that they were original members who had gotten cold feet after two large weapons thefts. The case remains classified.

The wide house has 3 stories and was built on a wide plot of land sold to him by his neighbor, to whom he had earlier sold a larger plot of land. The house was constructed entirely from salvaged materials. The New York State Board for Historic Preservation noted “its efficient and beautiful design, careful engineering, and effective interior plan. Challenged by a narrow lot and minimal financial means, Seely created a house that demonstrated both his ingenuity and the desire to provide, above all else, housing for his family.” The Westchester County Historical Society said “its professional construction and ingenious design are a testimony to the dedication of a prominent black contractor to build a solid, functional, and delightful home. It represents both black enterprise and good neighborliness, and is architecturally significant as a symbol of American ingenuity and craftsmanship.” Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs History During the mid-1910s, Nathan and Lillian Seely moved to the Washingtonville neighborhood of Mamaroneck, New York. The neighborhood was home to a community of first-generation immigrants predominantly Italian, and African-American families who moved to Westchester County as a result of the Great Migration. In 1925 Nathan Seely and his brother Willard founded Seely Brothers Inc., a construction company that aimed to build for African-American clients. Seely hired Italian masons from the Washingtonville neighborhood, as well as African-American laborers for the company's projects. Seely Brothers purchased 11 lots within the Washingtonville neighborhood and built several homes, including Nathan Seely's own house, a seven-room house that he had designed and built in 1926 on Grand Street for his own family. The house “showcased many amenities considered very modern at the time,” according to the submission to the National Park Service, which oversees the National Register of Historic Places. During the Great Depression Seely lost both his house and his company. In 1931, his neighbor Panfilo Santangelo, an Italian immigrant and stonemason, gave Nathan a twelve- and-a-half-foot strip of land between the Santangelo home and the former Seely home for Seely to build upon. The land that Santangelo's house sat upon had been previously purchased by him from Seely and ran between the two men's houses, including the property Mr. Seely lost when the Depression began. Mr. Seely died in 1962. Family members lived in the house until 1986, and it was bought by the daughter of the man who originally gave the land to Seely, Ida Santangelo, in 1988. Construction With little money to purchase new building materials, Mr. Seely salvaged and recycled building materials including railroad ties, windows, banisters and even a chicken coop to incorporate into his house. Seely designed and constructed his family's new home maximizing its utility by building a basement, two stories, and an attic. He also devised numerous built-ins and windows for natural lighting to give the impression of more interior space. He built the three ornate gables in the front facing facade, and added a ledge for flowerpots just under the second level window The wide by long, tall, hip roofed, wood shingled home is set on a by property. The house is positioned approximately back from the modern set back line on which the surrounding homes are built in order to maximize light exposure, and it is visible from the New England Thruway, Interstate 95. The Skinny House is sheathed in red brown wood shingles unifying the facades that are punctuated with a variety of windows and doors, which are trimmed in white painted wood. The main hip roof, first floor gable roof with a modified dormer, and entry gable roofs are of asphalt shingles. There are cables on the sides of the home to anchor it to the ground. Two railroad ties serving as beams run through the cellar. The sewer pipe is supported by finished marble. The house was heated with coal stoves on each floor. Floor grates allow heat to rise to the bedrooms. In the cellar there remains one original pot-bellied stove, coal chute and pails. One brick chimney on the west side of the house supports all of the stoves. The interior is finely finished with plaster and hardwood floors and moldings and woodwork throughout. The Grand Street home is one of a number of renowned “skinny houses” in the United States, including ones in Long Beach, California, Boston, Massachusetts and Deerfield, Illinois. In Amsterdam, the Netherlands, the \\"Smallest House in Amsterdam\\" at 22 Oude Hoogstraat is purported to be the narrowest house in Europe. That was constructed in 1733 and stands just wide. A living structure called Keret House in Warsaw, Poland built by architect Jakub Szczęsny in 2012 may be the world's narrowest house at only at its widest point however it is too narrow to be considered a residence under Polish law so it is considered to be an art installation. Landmark status The house was designated by the local county historical society as a landmark in 1991 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. In popular culture Seely's great- granddaughter, Dr. Julie Seely, wrote a screenplay titled “Skinny House” in 2011.

Among them are Hairy Projects, The Beautiful Ones, Character Recognition, Self Portraits, My White Friends, and Sketches for Something. Through her work, Greene prompts thought-provoking questions about how individuals are often judged based on skin color and other physical characteristics rather than on their character. Greene's introspective and race-conscious collections have been exhibited in galleries and exhibitions across the country and have gained national recognition in the media, including a New York Times spotlight piece for her collection \\"My White Friends\\" in 2012.  Biography  Born in 1975 in New York City and growing up in Harlem, Myra Green received her B.F.A. from Washington University in St. Louis (1997) and her M.F.A. in photography from the University of New Mexico (2002). She is currently an Associate Professor of Photography at Columbia College Chicago, and her photography collections have been featured regularly in national exhibitions, galleries, and museums since 2009.  Artwork  Throughout her career, Greene has confronted matters of race and personal identity through her work. Growing up in the predominantly black neighborhood of Harlem, New York, yet attending mostly white schools in the upper east side of New York, Greene has always been conscious of race and how it has influenced her personal narrative. In a New York Times interview, Greene states, \\"I'm always thinking about race. I recognize it when I'm the only black person in a room. My white friends will notice I'm the only black person, too. But they don't notice a room full of white people.\\" In her first collection to receive national attention, \\"Character Recognition\\", Greene's use of high contrast black glass ambrotypes prompts viewers to consider the unidimensional way black individuals are viewed in society. In a response to her feelings about how society first and foremost categorized her by her skin- color rather than judging her by who she is as a person, Greene's close-up and tightly framed images of portions of her own face prompt an uncomfortable answer to the questions the collection's title implies about whether she, and black people in general, are judged by their skin color rather than by their character. By using black glass ambrotype, Greene inclines viewers to associate and compare the images in her collection with historical images of African-American slaves taken in the 19th century that were intended to be used as species identifications in science textbooks. This linkage to historical African-American slave roots makes these images powerful reminders of the commodification and stereotyping Greene spotlights through the materials and medium she used to create this collection. The premise for her most well-known collection of photographs \\"My White Friends\\" originated after a discussion she had with one of her white friends about her images in \\"Character Recognition\\". Greene commented in an Art Beat interview that her friend said \\"they're really beautiful, but I just don't feel comfortable thinking about blackness.\\" In the conversation that followed, this friend admitted that he didn't think about his own whiteness when he looked at photos, which started Greene on a path to examine what it would look like to photograph her friends for their whiteness. Traveling around the country and asking her friends if she can \\"photograph them for their whiteness\\", Greene uses her friends' styles, gestures, and natural environments to create an image of them that captures their whiteness. While these images are constructed and are not meant to be portraits, her work prompts questions about what can and cannot be captured in a photo, what truths, if any, can be discovered through looking at photographs, and what assumptions viewers make every time they look at an image of a person. This collection gained national recognition and had a successful Kickstarter campaign that resulted in a book of the photographs in the collection \\"My White Friends\\".

As had been the case with the broader territory covered in the Gazetteer, '[t]here had previously been no comprehensive survey of London's ghost population'; 'the publicity it received - including posters on London's underground and buses - resulted in good sales'. Peter's son Christopher was responsible for all the photographs that illustrate the book, and as was the case with those he took for the Gazetteer, they were taken especially, and form a visual journey of their own. Underwood felt that 'he really captured something of the atmosphere and variety of London's haunted houses'. Furthermore, as far as Underwood was concerned, Haunted London was 'the cause not only of several other books but also guided tours of London, illustrated lectures, personal investigations and even a film'.

Underwood would subsequently lament one entry in the book; one that concerned 'the appearance of the Vicar of Radcliffe Wharf' (included in the section covering the 'Isle of Dogs'). Underwood's source material was a ghost story that had been written by Frank Smyth and published in Man, Myth & Magic, (part 105). Smyth's story gave the reader 'every impression of having happened', citing people who also claimed to have seen the ghost. However, in a confession published in The Sunday Times, he admitted to having made up the story. What particularly vexed Underwood was that, in their publication of the confession, The Sunday Times also cited the following line from Underwood's book: 'the appearance of the Vicar of Ratcliff Wharf is convincing and puzzling', whilst omitting the following words that precede it: 'If we accept the evidence of the four men'. Underwood's efforts to contact the paper regarding being quoted out of context failed.'They did not even reply, and I have never bought a copy of the newspaper since'; Haunted London was reprinted in paperback form by Fontana books in 1975, and in a revised form in 2010, by Amberley Publishing.; References 1973 books Ghost stories ","title":"Haunted London"},{"id":"48703581","title":"Sanremo Music Festival 1964"},{"id":"48703587","text":"William Fraser \\"Willie\\" Menmuir (born 3 February 1952) was a Scottish footballer who played for Bristol City, Hearts, Dumbarton and Alloa Athletic.

The company's lead product is HER-Vaxx, a therapeutic cancer vaccine for the treatment of gastric cancer and breast cancer, where the cancer is HER-2-positive. Imugene was planning a Phase Ib/II clinical study of HER-Vaxx in gastric cancer which it intended to initiate in 2016. Imugene stock is publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  History  Imugene began as a research project in the laboratory of Professor Ursula Wiedermann at the Medical University of Vienna. Over the nine years from 2004 Wiedermann et al. had developed a B cell peptide cancer immunotherapy that could induce an antibody response targeting HER-2 overexpressing tumours. In 2012 a start-up company called Biolife Science had been incorporated to develop this immunotherapy. Early-stage funding was secured from Australian and US investors in 2013, after which Biolife was taken public in December 2013 in a reverse takeover of an Australian drug development company called Imugene, whose name was retained after the merger. Around US$8m was spent on the HER-Vaxx programme prior to its becoming the 'new Imugene'.  HER-Vaxx  HER-Vaxx has been designed as a more effective alternative to the HER-2-targeting monoclonal antibody drugs Herceptin and Perjeta. In creating HER-Vaxx, Ursula Wiedermann and her colleagues at Medical University of Vienna took the three most immunogenic B cell epitopes from the extracellular domain of HER-2 molecule – called the P4, P6 and P7 antigens – and out of it constructed a peptide vaccine. P6 and P7 sit at the Herceptin binding site while P4 sits at the Perjeta site. The vaccine had been intended to be delivered in 'virosomes', that is, influenza virus particles stripped of their disease-causing contents so as to be able to carry peptides instead. However, in 2015 Imugene announced that it would deliver the vaccine with the diphtheria toxoid CRM197. The vaccine's developers argue that HER-Vaxx has a number of benefits over the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies. The vaccine generates a 'polyclonal' rather than a monoclonal antibody response to HER-2 – i.e. different kinds of antibodies – increasing the chance that cells carrying HER-2 will be killed, particularly those at an earlier stage of disease. The delivery system helps adjuvant the vaccine, increasing the size of the immune response. Thirdly, polyclonal antibodies do not appear to have the cardiotoxicity that has been observed in >10% of patients on Herceptin. The potential for immune memory may mean that the treatment effect is long-lasting (by contrast antibodies have a short half-life – that of Herceptin is only 12 days – meaning that the patient has to have infusions every 1–3 weeks). The vaccine would be available intra-muscularly, where Herceptin and Perjeta have to be given by regular infusions.  HER-Vaxx development history  Following on from favourable pre-clinical data, Wiedermann et al. ran a ten-patient safety study of HER-Vaxx in ten patients with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer, albeit with low HER-2 expression. This study found the vaccine to be safe, with no observed cardiotoxicity. The patients developed anti-HER-2 antibodies and in vitro, those anti-HER-2 antibodies showed potent anti-tumour activity. Also in vitro, blood from the patients carried markers of a cellular immune response such as IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α (meaning that ultimately patients could be expected to develop T cells to kill the cancer cells, and not just antibodies). The vaccine took down the 'T reg' cell count in the patients, potentially indicating an overcoming of the cancer's immunoresistance.  Planned clinical studies of HER-Vaxx  Imugene has indicated that it intends to run a Phase Ib/II trial in gastric cancer in 2017, in combination with chemotherapy. The Phase Ib segment of the study would recruit around 15 patients and establish the recommended Phase II dose. The Phase II segment, a randomised but open label study, would recruit around 68 patients and test for Progression-Free and Overall Survival.  Imugene stock  Imugene began as Vos Industries, developer of a new technology for frying food. This company, which made its initial public offering on the ASX in late 1993, was unsuccessful in commercialising the technology. The public company shell was then used from 2002 to list an animal vaccine technology venture, at which time the company took the name Imugene, short for 'Immune Genetics'. This venture was also unsuccessful. In mid-2012 the company was again restructured, this time to develop a drug delivery technology, however this venture was abandoned at the time of the Biolife Science merger, which was announced on 23 October 2013.  Main people  Imugene's executive chairman is Paul Hopper, an Australian bioentrepreneur based in Sydney who was instrumental in identifying the HER-Vaxx project and taking it public in Imugene. The company's chief operating officer is Leslie Chong, who used to be a Senior Clinical Program Lead at Genentech in San Francisco. Ursula Wiedermann remains involved as Chief Scientific Officer and Scientific Advisory Board member.

Mulford was born in Montrose, Pa., November 19, 1833, and was prepared for Yale College in Homer, New York, entering at the beginning of the Sophomore year. He graduated in 1855. For the year after graduation he remained at home, studying law with the Hon. William Jessup and general literature. He then spent a year in the Union Theological Seminary, New York City, whence he removed to the Andover Theological Seminary. He left Andover in January, 1859, and in the following May went abroad. After a year or more, spent mainly in Germany and Italy, he pursued further studies in New York City. On April 20, 1861, he was ordained a Deacon in the Protestant Episcopal Church by Bishop Williams, at Middletown, Connecticut, and for a few months had temporary charge of a parish in Darien, Conn. On March 19, 1862, he was advanced to the priesthood by Bishop Odenheimer, and in the succeeding autumn became rector of the Church of the Holy Communion in South Orange, N. J. He withdrew from this charge, and from further service as a parish minister, in November, 1864, on account of increasing deafness and for family reasons. He then settled in a secluded country home at Lakeside, near Montrose, Pa., where he devoted himself to reading and study. The first fruit of his retirement was a treatise entitled The Nation, published in 1871 (8°, pp. xiv, 418), which secured him a recognized place among the profound and original minds of his generation. The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on him by Yale in 1872. In 1880 he removed to Cambridge, Mass., chiefly for the sake of educational advantages for his children, and there he published in 1881 his second great work, The Republic of God, an Institute of Theology (8°, pp. viii, 261). He continued to be busy in study, and also found occupation in Cambridge, as Lecturer on Apologetics and Theology in the Episcopal Theological School, a duty which he continued to fulfill to the very last. In the summer of 1885 his health began to fail, and it was discovered that he was suffering from an acute form of Bright's disease. He died, at his home in Cambridge, December 9, 1885, in his 53rd year. He married, September 17, 1862, Rachel P. Carmalt, of Lakeside, Pa, who survived him, with four of their six children, two daughters and two sons.

History It was founded by the National Association of Pensioners' Associations within the Patriotic People's Front (HNF) under the name Party of Generations, Party of Pensioners and Families () in January 1990. During its inaugural meeting, jurist Vilmos Michaletzky was elected leader of the party. The NYUP worked for the interests of pensioners, and the party mainly focuses on issues related to health care, taxes and pensioners' issues. The party also had a Christian socialist ideology. The NYUP supported the ideas of family tax benefit and housing subsidies. Only one candidate of the party run in the 1990 parliamentary election, who received 0.04 percent of the individual votes, failing to obtain a mandate.Nohlen, D & Stöver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. However pharmacist and MP Imre Barcza, who had left the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) caucus earlier, joined the NYUP in October 1992, providing parliamentary representation for the small party. Before the 1994 parliamentary election, the NYUP negotiated on electoral cooperation with the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). Despite this the party's sole candidate gained only 0.02 percentage. For the 1998 parliamentary election, it joined the electoral alliance Union for Hungary, the NYUP had four candidates on the alliances' 80-member national list, but they did not reach the 5% election threshold. The NYUP strongly criticized the electoral system which was not favorable for extra- parliamentary parties. Their petition was rejected by the Constitutional Court of Hungary. Before the 2002 parliamentary election, Michaletzky began to negotiate with the internal conflict-ridden Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) to ensure a successful cooperation, however the NYUP withdrawn when the KDNP entered a coalition with the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP). Thus the party did not participate in the election. The NYUP joined the Hungarian National Alliance (MNSZ) which formed to contest the 2004 European Parliament election. On 27 April 2007, the NYUP transformed itself into a civil organization, called Family Protectional Association of Pensioners (NYCSE).

The Domus Severiana is the modern name given to the final extension to the imperial palaces on the Palatine Hill in Rome, built to the south-east of the Stadium Palatinum in the Domus Augustana of Septimius Severus. It included the Baths of Septimius Severus (Latin: Balneum Palatii). All that remains of the building are the imposing brick substructures at the corner of the hill, which created an artificial platform at the same level as the palace of Domitian, extending it, since the emperors had run out of space on the hill. There are very few remains of the building itself, which was then built on the terrace under the substructures. It had a view of Rome from the Circus Maximus and the Aventine Hill to the Caelian Hill and the Baths of Caracalla. They were part of an imperial baths complex or thermae, now visible in the remains below the exedra of the Stadium Palatinum, which may have been built under Domitian and which was rebuilt by Maxentius. They were fed by a branch of the Aqua Claudia, which spanned the valley between the Palatine Hill and the Caelian Hill and whose arches are still visible. On the side facing the via Appia, Septimius Severus commissioned an impressive three-level facade akin to the scaena in a theatre, with fountains and colonnades. This became known as the Septizodium. It is said that the emperor monumentalised this side of the building to impress his fellow Africans, who would arrive in Rome along the via Appia. The Septizodium's remains were demolished in the 16th century and it is only known from Renaissance drawings.

The system was named for Strasbourg, the French/German city on the Rhine and Kehl, at the time a suburb of Strasbourg. It was used by the Fritz X guided bomb and the Henschel Hs 293 guided missile, and would also be trialled in test of the Henschel Hs 298 MCLOS-guidance air-to-air missile.  Description  The Kehl-Straßburg system combined two units. The dual-axis, single-joystick-equipped Funkgerät (FuG 203) Kehl series of radio-control transmitter sets, fitted aboard the launch aircraft, were used to send the control signals to the ordnance, with the ordnance device itself picking up the signals through a Funkgerät (FuG 230) Straßburg receiver after release. The generic term Funkgerät, the source for the FuG prefix, translates directly into \\"radio equipment\\" in English, and also prefixed the designations of other various types of German military electronics, like the Lichtenstein and Neptun airborne intercept radar series, and the Erstling IFF radio gear, among others.  Electronic countermeasures  The Kehl-Straßburg control link relied on radio contact between the bomb or missile and the guidance unit. As a result, it was highly susceptible to electronic countermeasures. After the initial attacks in August 1943 the Allies went to considerable effort to develop devices which jammed the 48.2 MHz to 49.9 MHz low-VHF band radio link between the Kehl transmitter aboard the launching aircraft and the Straßburg receiver embedded in either the Hs 293 or the Fritz X ordnance. Early efforts by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) produced the XCJ jamming transmitter, installed aboard the destroyer escorts USS Herbert C. Jones and Frederick C. Davis in late September 1943. The XCJ was ineffective because the frequencies selected for jamming were incorrect. This was updated in time for Operation Shingle, leading to the XCJ-1, which was installed aboard destroyer escorts Frederick C. Davis and Herbert C. Jones, as well as destroyers Woolsey, Madison, Hilary P. Jones, and Lansdale. These six ships rotated service at Anzio, with three deployed at any time. The manually operated jamming system met with some success, though it proved cumbersome and was easily overwhelmed if large numbers of weapons were deployed simultaneously. In early 1944, the UK began to deploy its Type 650 transmitter, which employed a different approach. This system jammed the Straßburg receiver's intermediate frequency section, which operated at a 3 MHz frequency and appears to have been quite successful, especially because the operator did not have to attempt to find which of the 18 Kehl-Straßburg command frequencies were in use and then manually tune the jamming transmitter to one of them. The Type 650 automatically defeated the receiver, regardless which radio frequency had been selected for an individual missile, be it Fritz X or Hs 293. Following several intelligence coups, including a capture of an intact Hs 293 at Anzio and recovery of important Kehl transmitter components from a crashed Heinkel He 177 on Corsica, the Allies were able to develop far more effective countermeasures in time for the invasion of Normandy and Operation Dragoon. This included an updated XCJ-2 system from NRL (produced as the TX), the modified airborne AN/ARQ-8 Dinamate system from Harvard's Radio Research Laboratory, NRL's improved XCJ-3 model (produced as the CXGE), the Types MAS system produced by the Airborne Instruments Laboratory (at the time affiliated with the Radio Research laboratory), the British Type 651, and the Canadian Naval Jammer. Perhaps most impressive of all was AIL's Type MAS jammer, which employed sophisticated signals to defeat the Kehl transmission and to take over command of the Hs 293, steering it into the sea via a sequence of right- turn commands, triggering its solenoid-operated ailerons. Even more sophisticated jammers from NRL, designated XCK (to be produced as TY and designated TEA when combined with the upgraded XCJ-4) and XCL, were under development but were never deployed as the threat had evaporated before they could be put into service. In contrast to the experience at Anzio, jammers seemed to have had a major impact on operations after April 1944, with significant degradation observed in the probability that a Hs 293 launched at a target (and responding to operator guidance) would achieve a hit or damage- causing near miss.Martin J. Bollinger. Warriors and Wizards: Development and Defeat of Radio-Controlled Glide Bombs of the Third Reich, Annapolis: Naval Institute Press (2010). Counter Countermeasures In case of a heavy jamming attack against the radio control, the Germans used a wired remote control system. It could easily be swapped in place against the radio system. In the plane radio transmitter S203 was swapped against the audio amplifier S207. In the weapon, VHF receiver E230 was replaced by audio receiver E237. Both plane and bomb were equipped with a dual wire reel each, giving a maximum distance of 12 km.

Biography Cole was born into a Jewish family in New Haven, Connecticut. In September 1953. His father, Burton Michel, died in an apparent car accident. His father's death prompted a lifelong personal and academic inquiry into issues of spirituality, aging, and the question of what it means to grow old. Cole married Letha Birkholtz in 1972 and had two children, Jacob and Emma. He was divorced and married Thelma Jean Goodrich in 2007. They live in Houston. Education Cole studied philosophy as an undergraduate at Yale University. He graduated in 1971 under the mentorship of philosopher of religion Merold Westphal and political philosopher William McBride. He earned a Masters in American intellectual history under the direction of Donald Meyer at Wesleyan University (1975) and a Ph.D in history under the mentorship of Christopher Lasch at the University of Rochester (1980). His dissertation examined the history of aging in middle- class America in mid-19th and early 20th centuries. Academic career In 1982 Cole became a professor at UTMB Galveston, where he assisted his mentor, Ronald Carson, in developing the nation’s first Ph.D. Program in medical humanities. His 1993 book, The Journey of Life: A Cultural History of Aging in America]examined the tradition of European thought and art about aging, traced its evolution in America, and emphasized the absence of social and cultural meaning in later life.

All of the minor leagues are operated as independent businesses. Most are members of the umbrella organization formally known as National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL), which operates under the Commissioner of Baseball within the scope of organized baseball. Several leagues, known as independent baseball leagues, have no official links to Major League Baseball. Except for the Mexican League, teams in the organized minor leagues are generally independently owned and operated but are directly affiliated with one major league team through a standardized Player Development Contract (PDC). These leagues also go by the nicknames the \\"farm system\\", \\"farm clubs\\", or \\"farm teams\\" because of a joke passed around by major league players in the 1930s when St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey formalized the system, and teams in small towns were \\"growing players down on the farm like corn\\". Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball teams may enter into a PDC for a two- or four-year term. At the expiration of a PDC term, teams may renew their affiliation, or sign new PDCs with different clubs, though many relationships are renewed and endure for extended time periods. For example, the Omaha Storm Chasers (formerly the Omaha Royals and Omaha Golden Spikes) have been the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals since the Royals joined the American League in 1969, but the Columbus Clippers changed affiliations, after being associated with the New York Yankees from 1979, to the Washington Nationals in 2007, and have been affiliated with the Cleveland Indians since 2009. A few minor league teams are directly owned by their major league parent club, such as the Springfield Cardinals, owned by the St. Louis Cardinals, and all of the Atlanta Braves' affiliates except the Florida Fire Frogs. Minor League teams that are owned directly by the major league club do not have PDCs with the parent club and are typically not part of the reaffiliation shuffles that occur after each even-numbered season. As of 2018, there were 14 MLB-affiliated minor leagues with a total of 160 revenue- generating teams, located in large, medium, and small cities and suburbs across the United States and Canada, and there are three MLB-affiliated rookie leagues with a total of 80 teams, located in Arizona, Florida, and the Dominican Republic, though these teams do not generate revenue. On June 30, 2020, Minor League Baseball announced that the 2020 season would not be played due to the COVID-19 pandemic. History Class A-Advanced California League game in San Jose, California, 1994 The earliest professional baseball league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players of 1871 to 1875, comprised all fully professional teams. This system proved unworkable, however, as there was no way to ensure competitive balance, and financially unsound clubs often failed in midseason. This problem was solved in 1876 with the formation of the National League (NL), with a limited membership which excluded less competitive and financially weaker teams. Professional clubs outside the NL responded by forming regional associations of their own. There was a series of ad hoc groupings, such as the New England Association of 1877 and the Eastern Championship Association of 1881. These were loose groups of independent clubs which agreed to play a series of games over the course of one season for a championship pennant. The first true minor league is traditionally considered to be the Northwestern League of 1883 to 1884. Unlike the earlier minor associations, it was conceived as a permanent organization. It also, along with the NL and the American Association (AA), was a party to the National Agreement of 1883. Included in this was the agreement to respect the reserve lists of clubs in each league. Teams in the NL and the AA could only reserve players who had been paid at least $1000. Northwest League teams could reserve players paid merely $750, implicitly establishing the division into major and minor leagues. Over the next two decades, more minor leagues signed various versions of the National Agreement. Eventually, the minor leagues joined together to negotiate jointly. In the late 1890s, the Western League run by Ban Johnson decided to challenge the NL's position. In 1900, he changed the name of the league to the American League (AL) and vowed to make deals to sign contracts with players who were dissatisfied with the pay and terms of their deals with the NL. This led to a turf war that heated up in 1901 enough to concern Patrick T. Powers, president of the Eastern League, and many other minor league owners about the conflict potentially affecting their organizations. Representatives of the different minor leagues met at the Leland Hotel in Chicago on September 5, 1901. In response to the NL–AL battle, they agreed to form the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, called the NAPBL, or NA for short. (The NA uses the trade name Minor League Baseball today.) The purpose of the NAPBL at the time was to maintain the independence of the leagues involved. Several did not sign the agreement and continued to work independently. Powers was made the first president of the NAPBL, whose offices were established in Auburn, New York. In 1903, the conflict between the AL and NL ended in the National Agreement of 1903. The NAPBL became involved in the later stages of the negotiations to develop rules for the acquisition of players from their leagues by the NL and the AL. The 1903 agreement ensured that teams would be compensated for the players that they had taken the time and effort to scout and develop, and no NA team was required to sell their players, although most did because the cash was an important source of revenue for most teams. The NA leagues were still fiercely independent, and the term \\"minor\\" was seldom used in reference to them, save by the major-market sportswriters. Sports news, like most news generally, often did not travel far in the days before radio and television, so, while the leagues often bristled at the major market writers descriptions, they viewed themselves as independent sports businesses. Many baseball writers of that time regarded the greatest players of the minor leagues, such as Buzz Arlett, Jigger Statz, Ike Boone, Buddy Ryan, Earl Rapp and Frank Shellenback, as comparable to major league players. Leagues in the NA would not be truly called minor until Branch Rickey developed the first modern farm system in the 1930s. The Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis fought Rickey's scheme, but, ultimately, the Great Depression drove teams to establish systems like Rickey's to ensure a steady supply of players, as many NA and independent teams could not afford to keep their doors open without the patronage of Major League Baseball. The leagues of the NA became subordinate to the major leagues, creating the first minor leagues in the current sense of the term. Other than the Pacific Coast League (PCL), which under its president Pants Rowland tried to become a third major league in the Western states, the other leagues maintained autonomy in name only, being totally economically dependent upon the AL and NL. In 1922, the United States Supreme Court decision Federal Baseball Club v. National League (259 U.S. 200), which grants baseball a special immunity from antitrust laws, had a major effect on the minor leagues. The special immunity meant that the AL and NL could dictate terms under which every independent league did business. By 1925, major league baseball established a flat-fee purchase amount of $5,000 for the contract of any player from an NA member league team. This power was leveled primarily at the Baltimore Orioles, then a Triple-A team that had dominated the minors with stars. The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. This marked the first time since 1901 that there would be no Minor League Baseball played that year. Current system The third base stands of the Dell Diamond, home of the Round Rock Express With some exceptions, minor league teams are not owned by major league clubs but have affiliation contracts with them. Major League Rule 56 governs the standard terms of a Player Development Contract (PDC), which is the standard agreement of association between a minor league team and its major league affiliate. Generally, the parent major league club pays the salaries and benefits of uniformed personnel (players and coaches) and provides bats and balls, while the minor league club pays for in-season travel and other operational expenses. In even-numbered years, any major or minor league club with an expiring PDC may notify Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball, respectively, of its desire to explore a re-affiliation with a different PDC partner. The Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball offices then send a list of the corresponding major and minor league clubs seeking new affiliations, and there is a limited period of time in September within which clubs may agree upon new PDCs. If any are left over after this process, the Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball offices are empowered to assign major and minor league clubs to each other. At the start of the 2018 season, the longest continuous affiliations were two 53-year links: between the Philadelphia Phillies and their Double-A Eastern League affiliate, the Reading Fightin Phils; and the one between the Detroit Tigers and their Class A-Advanced Florida State League affiliate, the Lakeland Flying Tigers. Both Reading and Lakeland are now owned outright by their parent major league clubs. There are several baseball clubs that operate teams at multiple levels of the minor leagues; they are not required to affiliate all of their clubs to the same major league franchise. Bob Rich, Jr., for example, owns the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons and the short-season Class A West Virginia Black Bears, the latter of which had been the Jamestown Jammers before the 2015 season. Even though the teams were located slightly more than 70 miles (110 km) apart before the Jammers' relocation, Rich has never affiliated the two teams with the same parent club. The current minor league classification system divides leagues into one of six classes, those being Triple-A (AAA), Double-A (AA), Class A-Advanced (High A or A+), Class A (Low A), Class A Short Season, and Rookie. Furthermore, Rookie is further informally subdivided into Rookie Advanced, complex-based Rookie, and international summer baseball. Under the rules governing the affiliated minor leagues (specifically Major League Baseball Rule 51), Class A-Advanced, Class A, and Class A Short Season are separate classifications despite the similarity in name. Most leagues at Double-A and below play a split season, where the standings are reset at the halfway mark, and the winners of both halves qualify for post-season play. This allows teams to remain in contention longer into the season, as rosters feature heavy turnover during the course of the season. Triple-A Coca- Cola Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania, home of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies This classification currently includes two affiliated leagues: the International League and the Pacific Coast League, which feature teams from Eastern and Western United States respectively. For most of the 20th century, it also contained the American Association, based in the Midwest, but that league disbanded, its clubs absorbed by the other two leagues, as part of a reorganization of the Triple-A level in 1997. The Mexican League is also classified as a Triple-A league, though its clubs do not have PDCs with major league clubs. Both young players and veterans play for Triple-A teams. Teams usually hold many of the remaining 15 players of the 40-man major league roster whom the major league club has chosen not to play at the major league level. Players at Triple-A on the 40-man roster can be invited to come up to the major league club once the major league roster expands on September 1, although teams usually wait until their affiliates' playoff runs are over, should they qualify. For teams in contention for a pennant, it gives them fresh players. For those not in contention, it gives them an opportunity to evaluate their second-tier players against major league competition. Some Triple-A players are \\"career minor leaguers\\", former prospects whose skill growth has halted and are not likely to advance to MLB, unless as a temporary replacement. Unlike at other levels of competition, the two affiliated Triple-A leagues meet each summer in the Triple-A All-Star Game, first played in 1988. Each league fields a team composed of the top players in their respective leagues as voted on by fans, the media, and each club's field manager and general manager. In another instance of interleague play, the annual Triple-A Baseball National Championship Game has been held since 2006 to serve as a single championship game between the champions of the International League and Pacific Coast League to determine an overall champion of Triple-A baseball. There have previously been multi-game championship series, sometimes styled as the Junior World Series, for this purpose. Double-A There are currently three leagues in this classification: Eastern League, Southern League, and the Texas League. Some players jump to the majors from this level, as many of the top prospects are put here to play against each other rather than against minor and major league veterans in Triple-A. A small handful of players might be placed here to start, usually the veterans from foreign leagues with more experience in professional baseball. The expectation is usually that these players will be in the majors by the end of the season, as their salaries tend to be higher than those of most prospects. Class A-Advanced One level below Double-A, the California League, Carolina League, and the Florida State League play at the Class A-Advanced level, also known as \\"Class A+\\" or \\"High A\\". This is often a second or third promotion for a minor league player, although a few high first-round draftees, particularly those with college experience, begin at this level. These leagues play a complete season like Triple-A and Double-A, from April through early September. Many of the teams in the Florida State League are owned by major league parent clubs and use their spring training complexes. The class consists of 30 teams from around the United States, from San Jose to Tampa. Class A Will Rhymes bats during a 2006 Class A game between the West Michigan Whitecaps and Kane County Cougars Slightly below Class A-Advanced are the full-season Class A leagues, the South Atlantic League and Midwest League. These leagues are a mix of players moving up from the Short Season and Rookie leagues, as well as the occasional experienced first-year player. These leagues play a full 140-game schedule, which runs from the first week of April through the first week of September. Short-season leagues Short-season leagues, as the name implies, play a shortened season of 76 games, starting in mid-June and ending in early September, with only a few off-days during the season. The late start of the season is designed to allow college players to complete their college seasons in the spring, then be drafted, signed, and immediately placed in a competitive league (the MLB First Year Player Draft begins on the first Monday in June). Players in short-season leagues are a mixture of newly signed draftees who are considered more advanced than other draftees, and second-year pros who were not ready or for whom there was not space at a higher level to move up. Second-year pros are assigned to \\"extended spring training\\" in Florida or Arizona during April and May before reporting to their short season leagues. Of the 30 major league clubs, 14 field teams in Class A Short Season only, 8 clubs field their top short-season teams in the Rookie Advanced leagues, and 8 clubs have affiliates at both levels. A proposal put forth during the 2019–20 season would eliminate both levels and close all of the teams and leagues therein, in favor of re-designating Class A as \\"Low-A\\" and moving the shortened Major League Baseball Draft to August. Some of the teams that are in these leagues will not be eliminated and will instead be promoted to fill the positions of teams in higher leagues that will also be eliminated as part of the process.Madden, Bill (November 16, 2019). \\"Rob Manfred's Plan to Destroy Minor League Baseball.\\" New York Daily News. Retrieved February 19, 2020. Class A Short Season Class A Short Season, despite the name, is a separate classification from Class A. Class A Short Season teams are slightly more limited than Class A teams with respect to player age and years of experience in professional baseball. There are two Class A Short Season leagues, the New York–Penn League and Northwest League. Rookie Advanced The Appalachian League and Pioneer League are known as \\"Rookie Advanced\\" leagues. The players in these leagues are thought to be further along in their development than players in the pure Rookie leagues, and hence games are more competitive. Teams in these leagues sell concessions and charge admission. Rookie Jake Thompson pitches for the GCL Tigers against the GCL Blue Jays in 2012 MiLB leagues with the Rookie classification play a shortened season, similar to, but slightly shorter than, the short season leagues, starting in mid-June and ending in late August or early September. This lowest level of minor league baseball consists of two domestic leagues, the Arizona League and Gulf Coast League, and one foreign-based league, the Dominican Summer League. The domestic Rookie leagues play a 60-game schedule and are usually called \\"complex leagues\\" because games are played at their parent clubs' spring training complexes. Rosters comprise newly drafted players who are not ready for a higher level of play. These leagues are intended almost exclusively to allow players to hone their skills; no admission is charged and no concessions are sold. Rehabilitation assignments Players on the injured list (IL) can be sent to the minor leagues to aid in rehabilitation following an injury, typically for one or two weeks. Players are often sent to minor league clubs based on geography and facilities, not necessarily by class for these reassignments. Curt Schilling's recovery from an ankle injury in 2005 included a rehabilitation stint in Pawtucket, Rhode Island at the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, very close to the home club in Boston. The Cincinnati Reds often send players to their Class A affiliate, the Dayton Dragons, for rehab assignments. Despite Dayton's status as Class A, Dayton is a short, 50-mile drive away from the Reds' Great American Ball Park. Former Minnesota Twins superstar Joe Mauer, who missed most of the first two months of the 2011 season due to a difficult recovery from arthroscopic knee surgery after the 2010 season, reported to Minnesota's Class A-Advanced Florida State League team, the Fort Myers Miracle, which is based in their spring training facility in Fort Myers. In addition, the Miracle manager at the time was Mauer's older brother Jake. The Twins later sent Joe Mauer and pitcher Ricky Nolasco to rehab with the club's Low-A affiliate located across the Minnesota-Iowa border in Cedar Rapids. Mike Trout's first rehab assignment of his career, in July 2017, was with the Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino, California, the Class A-Advanced affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. This allowed Trout to stay closer to the Angels compared to the team's Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake Bees. Reorganization of 1963 The current minor league structure is largely based on a significant reorganization that occurred before the 1963 season, which was caused by the club and league contraction of the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1949, the peak of the post-World War II minor league baseball boom, 438 teams in 59 leagues were members of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues. By the end of 1963, only 15 leagues survived in the United States and Canada.Johnson, Lloyd, and Wolff, Miles, eds., The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, 2nd edition. Durham, North Carolina: Baseball America, 1997 Previous structure (1946–1962) From 1912 through 1945, the minors' highest level was labeled Double-A. In 1946, the Triple-A classification was created and the three Double-A circuits (the Pacific Coast League, International League, and the American Association) were automatically reclassified Triple-A. The Class A1 level, two rungs below the Majors and comprising the Texas League and the Southern Association, was then renamed Double-A. Prior to 1963, the Class A level was a higher classification than it is today. In 1946, Class A consisted of the Eastern League and the original South Atlantic League (or \\"Sally League\\"), and it would soon include the Western League (1947–1958), Central League (1948–1951) and Western International League (1952–1954). The Western International League became the Class B Northwest League in 1955, and the Western and Central loops folded. The remaining Class A leagues ascended to Double-A in the 1963 reorganization. Postwar Class A cities included communities such as Vancouver, Omaha, Colorado Springs, Charlotte, Scranton and Allentown, which would establish themselves as Triple-A venues, and Denver, which would get its own major league team, the Colorado Rockies, in 1993. The lower levels of the minors were ranked Classes B through D in descending order, with Class D being the equivalent of today's Rookie leagues. With the exception of the 1952–1957 Open classification experiment for the Pacific Coast League, this structure would remain intact through 1962. Pre-1963 classifications A baseball card of Joe DiMaggio when he played for the minor league San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, circa 1933–36. Defunct classifications, in use prior to 1963, were as follows: Open The Pacific Coast League, which had been rated Triple-A since 1946, was the only minor league to obtain Open classification, which existed from 1952 to 1957. At this time, the major leagues only extended as far west as Missouri and as far south as Washington, D.C. This classification severely restricted the rights of the major leagues to draft players out of the PCL, and at the time it seemed like the PCL would eventually become a third major league. The PCL would revert to Triple-A in 1958 due to increasing television coverage of major league games and in light of the Dodgers and Giants moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. Class A1 The forerunner to the modern Double-A classification, the A1 level existed from 1936 through 1945. In 1936, two Class A circuits, the Texas League and the Southern Association, were upgraded to Class A1 to signify their continued status as one step below the highest classification, then Double-A, yet a notch above their former Class A peers, the New York–Pennsylvania League and Western League. Ten years later, after World War II, with the minor leagues poised for unprecedented growth, classification terminology was changed. Beginning in 1946, the three Double-A leagues of 1912–1945, the American Association and International and Pacific Coast leagues, joined a new classification, Triple-A, and the Class A1 level became known as Double-A. Class B, C and D From 1902 through 1962, there were Class B, C, and D leagues. The Class D of that period would be equivalent to the Rookie level today. The other class designations disappeared because leagues of that level could not sustain operation during a large downturn in the financial fortunes of minor league baseball in the 1950s and 1960s caused by the rise of television broadcasts of major league sports across broad regions of the country. The impact of the Korean War in 1950 caused a player shortage in most cities in Class D and Class C. Class E Class E was established in 1937, for players with no professional experience in Class D or higher. The only Class E league that existed was the four-team Twin Ports League, which operated for less than a full season in 1943. The 1963 classification realignment After the 1962 season, the Triple-A American Association—which had lost key markets such as Milwaukee, Kansas City, Minneapolis, St. Paul and Houston to the Major Leagues since 1953—disbanded. The surviving International and Pacific Coast leagues absorbed the four remaining American Association franchises. Meanwhile, at the Double-A level and below there were even more significant changes: * The two existing Class A leagues—the Eastern and South Atlantic—were upgraded to Double-A, joining the Texas League and the unaffiliated Mexican League, then Double-A, as members of this classification. This move was caused by the disbanding of the Southern Association after 1961, leaving the six-team Texas League as the only U.S.-based Double-A circuit in 1962. In addition, many Major League parent teams had frequently treated the pre-1963 Eastern and South Atlantic leagues as de facto Double-A circuits, one step (rather than two) below Triple-A. * The Class B Carolina League and Northwest League, the Class C California League, Pioneer League and Northern League, and the Class D Florida State League, Georgia–Florida League, Midwest League, New York–Penn League, and Western Carolinas League were all designated Class A leagues. The unaffiliated Class C Mexican Central League was also designated as Class A. * The Class D Appalachian League, then the only \\"short- season\\" circuit, was given a new designation as a \\"Rookie\\" league. As part of the 1963 reorganization, Major League clubs increased their commitments to affiliate with minor league teams through Player Development Contracts, outright ownerships, or shared affiliations and co-op arrangements. Further changes after 1963 *Triple-A: The American Association was revived as a Triple-A league in 1969 and flourished with the minor league baseball boom of the 1980s and 1990s. However, all of its teams were again absorbed into the International and Pacific Coast leagues in 1998 as part of a sweeping reorganization of the minors' top classification. The American Association and the International League also played an interlocking schedule during the late 1980s as part of the Triple-A Alliance. The Mexican League was upgraded from Double-A to Triple-A in 1967. *Double-A: In 1964, the South Atlantic League changed its name to its current identity, the Southern League. Because of continued contraction (and Major League expansion) that left each circuit with only seven teams, the Texas and Southern leagues merged into the 14-team Dixie Association in 1971. The arrangement lasted only for that season and the records and history of the Texas and Southern loops were kept distinct. In 1972, each league added an eighth team, rebalancing their schedules. They resumed their former, separate identities, and returned to prosperity with the revival of minor league baseball that began in the 1980s. *Class A: In 1965, the Class A Short Season designation was created, and the Northern and Northwest loops moved from \\"full season\\" Class A into the new classification, with the New York–Penn League joining them in 1967. Over time, the California, Carolina and Florida State leagues became known within baseball as Class A-Advanced leagues, one rung below Double-A, splitting the Class A level even further. The Georgia–Florida League disbanded after the 1963 season, while the Northern League played its last year in official minor league baseball in 1971. In 1980, the Western Carolinas League changed its identity to become the modern incarnation of the South Atlantic League. *Rookie: In 1964, the Pioneer League stepped down from Class A to Rookie league status, and the first \\"complex-based\\" leagues, the Sarasota Rookie League and the Cocoa Rookie League, made their debuts. The Sarasota Rookie League underwent a name change to the Florida Rookie League in 1965 before becoming the modern Gulf Coast League the next season. The Cocoa Rookie League lasted only one season, and the Florida East Coast League of 1972, based in the same region of the state, also existed for only one year. In 1989, a counterpart to the Gulf Coast League, the Arizona League, made its debut and it continues to operate as a Rookie-level league for MLB teams with spring training facilities based in Arizona. *Failed start-up leagues: During the 1970s, three \\"official\\" minor leagues attempted unsuccessfully to revive unaffiliated baseball within the organized baseball structure. These were the Class A Gulf States League (1976) and Lone Star League (1977), and the Triple-A Inter–American League (1979). None lasted more than a full season. Reorganization of 2021 In October 2019, Baseball America reported that Major League Baseball had proposed dramatic changes to MiLB that would take effect after the current Professional Baseball Agreement that governs the MLB–MiLB relationship expires at the end of the 2020 season. (soft paywall) In mid-November, more than 100 members of the United States Congress signed a letter sent to Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred opposing the proposal, noting that it \\"is not in the best interest of the overall game of baseball\\" and that it would \\"devastate our communities, their bond purchasers and other stakeholders affected by the potential loss of these clubs.\\" A response from MLB highlighted that the proposal aims to improve player travel and working conditions. On November 21, Minor League Baseball released a statement, asserting that it is \\"unnecessary and unacceptable to wipe out one-quarter of minor league teams\\" and characterized the proposal as a way \\"to improve the profitability of MLB\\". Manfred rebuked Minor League Baseball for releasing the negotiations to the public and threatened to cut ties with MiLB altogether. The following changes have since been implemented: * The Rookie level Appalachian League was converted to a collegiate summer baseball league designed for rising freshmen and sophomores. Further proposals MLB's initial proposal also featured the following: * The number of MiLB teams, then at 160, would be reduced to 120 (not counting teams in the complex-based Arizona and Gulf Coast Leagues, both of which are directly owned by MLB). This would also result in the elimination of the Short-Season A and Rookie classifications from the system, apart from the complex-based leagues. * The proposal also called for two independent league teams, the St. Paul Saints and the Sugar Land Skeeters, to be brought into MiLB. * MLB would take effective control over team affiliations, replacing the current two-year contracts between MLB and MiLB teams with longer-term agreements. * MiLB leagues would be reorganized to be more geographically compact. The classifications of surviving teams would also be dramatically shuffled. * The Major League Baseball draft would be moved to follow the College World Series, and reduced from its current 40 rounds to between 20 and 25. Drafted players would train at the teams' spring training complexes until the following spring when they would begin MiLB play. * MLB proposed the establishment of what it calls the \\"Dream League\\", jointly operated by MLB and MiLB and featuring undrafted players. While teams eliminated from the affiliated system could become part of the Dream League, it was anticipated that this circuit's increased expenses would likely prevent many eliminated Short-A and Rookie-level teams (especially in the Appalachian and Pioneer Leagues) from participating. The MLB proposal would encourage those teams to form new amateur collegiate summer baseball leagues sponsored by MLB. * MLB teams would be limited to operating five MiLB teams in the U.S. (or Canada)—four full-season affiliates, plus one complex-based Rookie-level team. Each MLB team would also be limited to between 150 and 200 players under MiLB contracts. * Annual Baseball Cup involving both MLB and MiLB teams. Players Major league clubs may only use players who are on the team's major league active roster in games; players on the active roster are selected from a 40-man major league reserve list (often called the 40-man roster). Effective with the 2020 Major League Baseball season, the active roster size for each team is 26 players for regular games and 27 players for scheduled doubleheaders, with the roster size expanding to 28 players from September 1 through the end of the regular season. Prior to the 2020 season, the active roster size from the start of the regular season until September 1 was 25 players, with a 26th player allowed for a scheduled doubleheader. From September 1 to the end of the regular season, teams were allowed to expand their active rosters up to 40 players, the size of the major league reserve list. Players of the Double-A Springfield Cardinals in July 2017 Players on the 40-man reserve list who are not on the team's active roster are generally either on the injured list or playing at some level of the minor leagues (usually at the Triple-A or Double-A level). Players on the 40-man reserve list are eligible for membership in the Major League Baseball Players Association. These minor league players work at the lower end of major league pay scales and are covered by all rules and player agreements of the players association. Minor league players not on the 40-man reserve list are under contract to their respective parent Major League Baseball clubs but have no union. They generally work for far less pay as they develop their skills and work their way up the ladder toward the major leagues. Many players have signing bonuses and other additional compensation that can run into the millions of dollars, although that is generally reserved for early-round draft picks. A major league team's director of player development determines where a given player will be placed in the farm system, in coordination with the coaches and managers who evaluate their talent. At the end of spring training, players both from the spring major camp and minor league winter camp are placed by the major league club on the roster of a minor league team. The director of player development and the general manager usually determine the initial assignments for new draftees, who typically begin playing professionally in June after they have been signed to contracts. The farm system is ever-changing, and the evaluation of players is a constantly ongoing process. The director of player development and his managers meet or teleconference regularly to discuss how players are performing at each level. Personal development, injuries, and high levels of achievement by players in the classes below all steer a player's movement up and down in the class system. Players will play for the team to which they are assigned for the duration of that season unless they are \\"called up\\" (promoted to a higher level), \\"sent down\\" (demoted to a lower-class team in the major league club's farm system), or released from the farm system entirely. A release from minor- league level used to spell the end of a minor league player's career. In more modern times, released players often sign with independent baseball clubs, which are scouted heavily by major league organizations. Many players get a second or third look from the major league scouts if they improve in the independent leagues. Minor league salaries vary based on class level and length of season; however, the majority of players make less than $10,000 per season. Although not playing at the major league, minor league players are professional athletes. Minor league players describe the majors as \\"The Show\\". Umpires Ryan Blakney (left) and Ben May umpiring in the Midwest League in 2008 Umpires at the minor league level are overseen by Minor League Baseball Umpire Development, which is responsible for the training, evaluation, and recommendation for promotion and retention or release of the umpires. The umpires are evaluated eight times a season by the staff of the MiLB Umpire Development and receive a ranking at mid-season and the end of each year. Based on performance during the year, an umpire may advance in classification when a position opens in-season or during the off-season. Umpire Development holds an annual evaluation course every year in March to evaluate rookie umpires. Participants are normally the best students from the two professional umpire schools (one owned and operated by the same entity). The top students who pass the evaluation course are recommended for the first openings in the Rookie and short-season leagues.Wendelstedt course overview Wendelstedt umpire school. February 19, 2010 Any student who wants to work as an umpire must attend a professional umpire training school. The MiLB recognizes two schools for training prospective professional umpires, the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School and Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy, both located in Florida. The Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy is owned and operated by Minor League Baseball Umpire Development (MiLBUD), while Wendelstedt is independently owned by MLB Umpire Hunter Wendelstedt. The classes for each school are held for five weeks in January and February. The instructors at these schools are former or present major or minor league umpires. Simply attending one of these schools, however, does not guarantee that the candidate will also be recommended either to the evaluation course or to the openings in the Rookie or short season leagues. Generally, less than 20% of umpire school students move on to the Rookie Evaluation Course.Minor league baseball umpires February 19, 2010 Before the umpire development program was created, the Minor League presidents would recruit umpires directly from the schools. Umpires were then \\"sold\\" from league to league by word of mouth through the various league presidents.Umpire development history Minor League Baseball portal. February 19, 2010 The umpire development program first started in 1964, when it was decided that a method of recruitment, training, and development for umpires of both major and minor leagues was needed. The Umpire Development Program was founded at Baseball's 1964 Winter Meetings in Houston, and it began operating the next year. The program aimed to recruit more athletic, energetic, and dedicated individuals who would also have high morals and integrity standards. In 1968, it was decided that the program needed its own umpire training course which would be held each year. The first \\"Umpire Specialization Course\\" was held in St. Petersburg, Florida the following year.Minor league umpires Retrieved on February 19, 2010 Presently, the candidates for a job in professional umpiring must meet several requirements in order to be considered. An applicant must have a high school diploma or a G.E.D., must be athletic, and also must have 20/20 vision, though they are permitted to wear glasses or contact lenses.How to become an umpire Retrieved on February 19, 2010 They must also have good communication skills, good reflexes and coordination, and must have trained at one of the two professional umpire schools.

Independent baseball Haymarket Park, home to the Lincoln Saltdogs, an independent baseball team in Lincoln, Nebraska Independent leagues are those professional leagues in the United States and Canada not under the purview of organized Minor League Baseball and the Commissioner of Baseball. Independent baseball existed in the early 20th century and has become prominent again since 1993. Leagues operated mostly autonomously before 1902, when the majority joined the NAPBL. From then until 1915, a total of eight new and existing leagues remained independent. Most joined the National Association after one season of independence. Notable exceptions were the California League, which was independent in 1902 and from 1907 to 1909; the United States Baseball League, which folded during its independent 1912 season; and the Colonial League, a National Association Member that went independent in 1915 and then folded. Another independent league, the Federal League, played at a level considered major league from 1914 to 1915. Few independent leagues existed between 1915 and 1993. Major exceptions included the Carolina League and the Quebec-based Provincial League. The Carolina League, based in the North Carolina Piedmont region, gained a reputation as a notorious \\"outlaw league\\" during its existence from 1936 to 1938. The Provincial League fielded six teams across Quebec and was independent from 1948 to 1949. Similarly to early 20th-century independent leagues, it joined the National Association in 1950, playing for six more years. Independent leagues saw new growth after 1992, after the new Professional Baseball Agreement in organized baseball instituted more stringent revenue and stadium requirements on members. Over the next eight years, at least 16 independent leagues formed, of which six existed in 2002.

He was prepared for College at the age of fourteen, but was then on account of his youth put into a business house for four years. He entered Yale College in February, 1854 and graduated in 1857. On leaving College he spent two years in the Auburn Theological Seminary at Auburn, N. Y , and a third year in Union Seminary, New York City. For a year he preached as a stated supply in the suburbs of Portland, Maine, and in the meantime married, May 1, 1861, Sarah Brown, the only daughter of Robert Brown, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and sister of a classmate. Later, he supplied the Presbytenan Church in Englewood, New Jersey, from the spring of 1862, till February, 1863, during the regular pastor's absence, but a constitutional weakness of the throat induced him to relinquish preaching, after this time. He was then solicited to open a preparatory school for boys in Englewood, and spent over three years in that employment. In 1866 he removed to Cincinnati and entered into business, in which he spent the rest of his life. He died in Cincinnati, after a short illness from typhoid fever, August 26, 1885, in his 51st year. His wife survived him, without children. Gray was an honored elder in the Mount Auburn Presbyterian Church, from December, 1871, until his death, except for a brief interval of voluntary retirement; and as the faithful teacher for half that time of a very large class in the Sunday School exercised a great influence over the young. He published anonymously in 1884 a volume entitled Eight Studies on the Lord's Day, which attracted attention widely as a scholarly and thoughtful defense of the Christian Sabbath.

Langer subsequently pursued training in oncology at MD Anderson Hospital in Houston and in liver transplantation at Brigham Hospital in Boston. In 1963, he was named to the staff of the TGH. Although a general surgeon, Langer developed an expertise in liver, pancreas and biliary tract surgeries. He became head of the general surgery division at the hospital in 1972. In that role, he established a recruitment methodology which allowed the development of subspeciality areas within general surgery. In 1985, he performed the first liver transplant in Toronto. As a member of the Provincial Advisory Committee on Surgical Oncology, the Cancer Quality Council of Ontario and the Cancer Surgery Quality Committee, he helped raise the standards for cancer care in Ontario; these improved standards were also used as a model in other parts of Canada. In 1982, Langer became R.S. McLaughlin Professor and chair of the surgery department at the University of Toronto. He established a Surgeon Scientist Program, aimed at providing surgeons with research training. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada's Clinician Investigator Program, established in 1994, was modelled after the Surgeon Scientist Program. Langer also served as president of the Canadian Association of General Surgeons, as president of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract, as the first vice president of the American Surgical Association and as president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

History  Remains of the temple on the isola Tiberina It was first built between 293 and 290 BC and was dedicated in 289 BC. According to legend, a plague hit Rome in 293 BC, leading the senate to build a temple to Asclepius, Latinised to 'Esculapius'. After having consulted the Sibylline Books and gained a favourable response, a delegation of Roman elders was sent to Epidaurus in Greece, famous for its sanctuary to Asclepius, to obtain a statue of him to bring back to Rome. The legend also relates that during the propitiatory rites a large serpent (one of the god's attributes) slithered from the sanctuary and hid in the Roman ship. Certain that this was a sign of the god's favour, the Roman delegation quickly returned home, where the plague was still raging. As they were on the river Tiber and about to reach Rome, the snake crawled out of the ship and disappeared from sight on the island, marking the site where the temple was to be built. Work on the temple began immediately and it was dedicated in 289 BC - soon afterwards, the plague ended. In memory of the event, the front of the island was also remodelled to imitate a trireme. An obelisk marked the island's centre, in front of the temple, to resemble a mast, while blocks of travertine were placed along the edges to look like a bow and stern. Several other structures arose on the island to shelter the sick, as evidenced by several surviving votives and inscriptions. If still in use by the 4th-and 5th century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.  Remains  The island with the hospital, showing its similarity to a trireme. In the background is the basilica of San Bartolomeo. The temple was destroyed in the medieval period and as early as 1000 the basilica of San Bartolomeo all'Isola was built on its remains by Otto III. The medieval well near the altar of the church seems to be the same as that used to draw water for the sick in the classical period as mentioned by Sextus Pompeius Festus, a 2nd-century Latin grammarian. There is also the Fatebenefratelli Hospital in front of the basilica. Little remains of the temple - some fragments of the obelisk are now held in Naples and Munich and some travertine blocks were re-used in modern buildings on the island, including a relief of the staff of Asclepius.

The song was the inspiration for the title of the 2009 film of the same name. Origin and recording According to drummer Patty Schemel, she and Courtney Love came up with the idea for the song in 1992 while in San Francisco; at the time, Love's husband Kurt Cobain was working with Melvins on their album Lysol (1992). The song was recorded at Triclops Studios in October 1993 during the recording sessions for Live Through This. Schemel recalled that the song was recorded in two takes. Composition and lyrics The meaning of the song has been interpreted and deciphered many different ways; however, the general theme of the lyrics deal with a woman's kidnapping and dismemberment. According to Everett True, the song was thought to be inspired by Jennie Boddy, a music publicist. Its lyrics appear to tell the narrative of a woman in captivity, being held \\"in a box by the bed\\", before eventually being murdered and dismembered. The line in the song, \\"He keeps you in a box by the bed, alive, but just barely\\" bears similarity to the 1977 kidnapping of Colleen Stan, a woman who was taken captive and kept as a sex slave for seven years by Cameron and Janice Hooker. During her seven-year captivity, Stan was frequently imprisoned in a wooden box underneath Hooker's bed. Though the case bears a similarity, Love and the band have never commented on it being an inspiration. Interpretation The song has been interpreted by feminist scholars as about literal violence against a woman's body, as well as using \\"corporeal fragmentation,\\" representing a woman's body being enjoyed \\"piecemeal in objectified parts.\\" The song's ending with the repeated lines \\"Just relax, just relax, just go to sleep,\\" have been interpreted by feminist scholars as assuming the role of a male aggressor speaking to his female victim who is either being lulled to sleep, or experiencing death. When Diablo Cody wrote the script for her 2009 film of the same name, she said she had been drawn to it because of how dark it was, and chose to name the film after it because \\"[It was] a creepy song. It's sort of like a horror movie.\\" In culture The song was the basis of the title for the 2009 comedy horror film Jennifer's Body.

The Guildhall faces directly onto Lincoln High Street and stands to the north of Sibthorp Street. To the south is the late Saxon church of St Peter at Gowts. Stocker describes it as \\"the only survivor from the small group of the king's town houses which existed in several major towns….St Mary's Guildhall is a domestic complex on a palatial scale, indicating the highest social status, and as such is representative of a little known urban building type\\".\\"Stocker\\", (1991) History of the Guildhall It is now thought that the Guildhall was a built as a Royal palace of Henry II and completed by 1157, although there is no absolutely certain evidence that it was in Royal ownership before 1228.Stocker, D.A., et al (1991).St Mary's Guildhall, Lincoln. The Survey and Excavation of a Medieval Building Complex C.B.A. /City of Lincoln Archaeology Unit: The Archaeology of Lincoln, VolXII-1, pp. 6–7 & 38–39. In 1251 the building was sold by Henry III’s butler, Michael de la Burne to the guild of St Mary of Lincoln. It remained in the ownership of the guild until 1547 when it passed into the ownership of the Lincoln City Council. Until 1614 it was leased to various tenants, but in that year it was leased to the recently established Lincoln Christ’s Hopital Blue Coat school. This lease continued until 1633, although the school had moved to a new site on the Christ’s Hopital Terrace, just below Lincoln Cathedral in 1623. Subsequent leases were to the Fawkes family who sub-let parts of the property. In 1815 it was leased to Coningsby Waldo Sibthorp, M.P. of Canwick Hall. and the lease shows that the northern part of the property was being used for malting. Following the Municipal Reform Act in 1835, his son Charles de Laet Sibthorp was able to purchase the Guildhall and the Paddock behind for £455 \\"Stocker\\", p. 10 The paddock behind the buildings was used as the first home of Lincoln City Football Club between 1884 and 1895. Gradually the Lucas family of builders took over the leases for the property. The Maltings had been leased to the Brewing firm Warwicks and Richardsons, which ceased operations around 1913. The Sibthorp street estate was laid out in the 1890s and the two early houses of the west wing of the palace were demolished in 1896 to make way for the street. In 1930 the building was scheduled as an Ancient Monument. Following the death of Coningsby Charles Waldo Sibthorp in 1932 an appeal was launched to purchase the Guildhall, but in 1938 the City Council stepped in and purchased the Guildhall.\\"Stocker\\", pg. 10 The building continued to be occupied by Lucas’s as a builder’s yard until 1981, when it was leased by the Lincoln Civic Trust. Between 1981 and 1986 excavation and recording of the buildings took place and between 1984 and 1986 restoration followed.\\"Stocker\\", p. 11 The Guildhall is now used as the offices of the Lincoln Civic Trust and as a church hall.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-486049-st-mary-s-guildhall- lincolnshire#.Vl4kTUvtDJx  Occupation on the site before the Building of the Guildhall Excavations in 1982 and 1983 found evidence of the Roman road known as Fosse Way under the frontage of the Guildhall and it appears to have been converging at this point with the Ermine Street. To the east of the Fosse Way there were two Roman buildings of the 3rd Century A.D. with stone foundations and timber-framed structures. The Roman road showed marked rutting from carts. There was also evidence for Late Saxon structures and rubbish pits of 10–12th century date.\\"Stocker\\" (1991) 15–16 and fig. 7. Was the St Mary Guildhall a Royal Palace of Henry II? The realisation that the St Mary Guildhall was not specifically built for the Great Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and, that it was built at some time previous to 1251/2, when it was acquired by the Guild, opens up the possibility that it had been a Royal Palace or hospicium, where and Henry II had a crown wearing or second crowning. This ceremony took place in 1157 on a visit to the city at Christmas. .Johnson C.P.C. in \\"Stocker\\" (1991), 5–6 Henry II had a number of provincial palaces including those at Oxford,Colvin H. M. ed. (1963), The History of the King's Works, Vol.ii: The Middle Ages, H.M.S.O. pp. 986–7 Gloucester, and Winchester. The existence of one in Lincoln is known from the chronicler Roger of Hoveden Roger of Hoveden Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi et Gesta Regis Ricardi Benedicti abates (ed. William Stubbs) (2 vols., Rolls series, 1867), available at Gallica. Roger refers to a palace in the suburb of Wigford in Lincoln. Also in the same year Henry authorised the expenditure of £7/15/- on the repairs to the Hospicium and the expenditure of £30 on his retinue of huntsmen, squires and others who accompanied him there.Hunter J. (1844), ‘The Great Rolls of the Pipe, p. 44 David Stocker has argued that by far the most likely building in Wigford to have been Henry’s Palace would have been the Guildhall. Architectural stone fragments from the building, particularly those with acanthus scrolls and volutes can be fairly closely dated to the period 1150–70 and this would fit in with the date of the building Guildhall.The building of the Guildhall is Phase 4 in Stocker’s report, \\"Stocker\\", (1991), pp. 33–37 The mention of \\"repairs\\" (in reparatione) in 1157 was a term that often indicated the final expenses on completion of a building. Stockers main case rests on the fact that the St Mary Guildhall was built on a much grander scale than the other Romanesque Houses in Lincoln, such as the Norman House, Jew's House and the St Andrew's Hall. He points out that the first floor great hall of the Guildhall with its arcaded decoration, measures 20 m × 6.5 m, which makes it amongst the largest in a surviving building of the 12th century.\\"Stocker\\" (1991), 37–41 Details of other Royal Halls are discussed in \\"The History of the Kings Works\\".Colvin H. M. ed. (1963), The History of the King's Works, Vol.ii: The Middle Ages, H.M.S.O. pp. 43–44 However, the earlier ownership of Guildhall as constructed by Johnson does not fully fit this idea, even though the property was certainly owned by King Henry III.Johnson C.P.C. in \\"Stocker\\" (1991), 5–6 Johnson deduces that the property was originally owned by John de Holm (whose son, Adam was the first Mayor of Lincoln until 1216). John de Holm sold the Guildhall in 1228, via John le Marshall to King Henry. The King appears to have used the building for wine storage and then disposed of it to his butler, de la Burne in 1250, who almost immediately sold it to the Guild of St Mary in 1250/1.Johnson C.P.C. in \\"Stocker\\" (1991), 6–7 However, as there is some uncertainty about the property boundaries, and it may be that Henry III was adding a further property to the one he already owned, this does not necessarily rule out the idea that Guildhall was originally a Royal palace.  Samuel Hieronymous Grimm and the recording of the Guildhall c. 1784 St Peter at Gowt's Church and the St Mary Guildhall by S. H. Grimm, 1784 One of the most useful sources of information for the history of the Guildhall are the ink-wash drawings of Samuel Hieronymous Grimm a Swiss artist who was extensively employed by the Dean of Lincoln, Sir Richard Kaye mainly to record architectural subjects. Many of these drawings are in the British LibraryBritish Library but there are some of his drawings in the Usher Gallery. There are four drawings of the St Mary Guildhall, done about 1784. These include a view looking up the High Street with the Saxon Church of St Peter at Gowts in the foreground on the right and the St Mary's Guildhall to the left. The stone house closest to the church with the chimney, together with the bay with the porch next to the Guildhall were demolished in 1896 to make way for Sibthorp Street. There is another view in the Usher Gallery which is looking at the Guildhall from the opposite direction and provides more information about the houses to the south which were demolished.The Collection . Although these demolished houses contain Romanesque windows it is likely that they were rebuilt in the 17th century making use of earlier building material. St Mary Guildhall, Lincoln. Norman gateway drawn by S. H. Grimm in 1784 Grimm also provides a detailed drawing of the main entrance showing the orders of the arch studded with flowers and dogtooth ornament and two heads on the door jamb, one of which is a bishop. Above this is a running frieze with two heads above. Norman House, St Mary Guildhall, Lincoln by S. H. Grimm in 1784 The survey work on the west front has shown that originally the Guildhall had a first-floor hall that was lit with five Romanesque windows, similar to those on the St Andrews Hall on the opposite side of the street.Anon. (1983), Norman Buildings in Lincoln, City and County Museum, Lincoln. Information Sheet, Archeology Series no. 26. Lincolnshire County Council The frontage also had two tall chimney stacks. Grimm also drew the Norman House which stands on the north side of the courtyard behind the Guildhall. Although this building has two Romanesque windows and a massive pilaster on the front, it is in all probability an early 17th rebuild from the time that the Christ's Hospital Bluecoat School occupied the premises.\\"Antram\\", (1989), 505 The Romanesque windows appear to be very similar to those on the buildings that were demolished in 1896, and possibly would have come from the source. The Norman House and adjacent building were used in the later 18th and 19th century as a malting floor and barley store. Architectural history West front of St Mary Guildhall The exterior of the west range faces Lincoln High Street, The facade consists of five bays, has shallow buttresses, chamfered plinth and band of Romanesque decoration with bird and beast masks to the northern part. Nearly central to the limestone frontage is moulded carriageway arch with segmental pointed inner arch, flanked by single buttresses. Above it are two reset masks. In the courtyard behind is a two-storey building, two bays, known as the Norman House, with a shallow central buttress and a moulded first-floor band. The lower south range of five bays, fronting Sibthorp Street, incorporates several reset 12th-century fragments and is now the church Hall for St Peter's at Gowts Church Hall. Literature *Hill, J. W.

This task was nominally assumed by a priest from Jaffa or Haifa (Boulos Meouchi or Francis Moubarac). ** Boulos Meouchi, 1941-1945. The monk responsible for the monastery of Jaffa. On 25 September 1941, a Patriarchal Decree appointed him president of the Court of First Instance in Jaffa. ** Francis Moubarac, 1945-1949. * Elias Ziadé or Ziadeh, 1949-1975. The number of faithful right before the war of 1948 was 800, after which it dropped to about 60. On 11 July 1949, Elias Ziadé was appointed Vicar in Jerusalem by Patriarchal decree. On 11 August, another decree extended this office to Transjordan. Father Ziadé stayed in charge until his death on 23 April 1975. ** Also in 1949, Mr. Michel Edde was appointed as the first \\"Moukhtar\\" of the community. On 15 June 1958, the Jordanian Government officially recognized the Maronite Church. On 15 May 1964, Patriarch Meouchi placed Monsignor Elias Ziadé in charge as parish priest of the Maronites in Jordan. A welfare society run by eight members was established and, on 28 July 1964, the society was recognized by the Jordanian Ministry of Interior Affairs. * Augustin Harfouche, 1975-1996.maronitejerusalem.org catholicchurch- holyland.com Patriarchal Exarchs * Paul Nabil El-SayahSala Stampa della Santa Sede, ed.

It established a Council of Government of 27 members: eight ex officio members, nine appointed by the governor (at least three of which could not be officials), and ten elected (one per district, but two from Port Louis).H. A. Will, \\"Problems of Constitutional Reform in Jamaica, Mauritius and Trinidad, 1880–1895\\", The English Historical Review, Vol. 81, No. 321 (Oct., 1966), pp. 693–716. The franchise was restricted to men, and there were property and education qualifications designed to exclude the vast majority of Indians. Prior to 1885, the Mauritian council comprised the governor and eight other officials ex officio and eight councilors nominated by the governor. The initiative in changing the constitution lay with Laurent Loïs Raoul, who organized a town hall meeting of the French planter class in Port Louis on 30 June 1882. A committee was set up two weeks later, and on 4 October it presented a petition to secure the addition of elected members to the governing council.Chit Geerjanand Dukhira, History of Mauritius: Experiments in Democracy (2002), p. 41. On 31 October 1882, Lieutenant- Governor F. N. Broome forwarded the petition to the colonial secretary, the Earl of Kimberley. Broome advised Kimberley against the proposal, saying: \\"It must shut out the Indian and the descendant of the old slave population, and so place the power in the hands of an oligarchy of the upper classes ... or it must place power in the hands of the ignorant mass of people not fitted to exercise it.\\" The governor at the time, John Pope Hennessy, was an Irish home ruler who advocated a \\"Mauritius for the Mauritians\\", emphasising the rights of the Indians and the Creoles. The result was a relatively liberal constitution for a colony.S. A. de Smith, \\"Mauritius: Constitutionalism in a Plural Society\\", The Modern Law Review, Vol. 31, No. 6 (Nov., 1968), pp. 601–22, at 604. Kimberley's successor, the Earl of Derby, insisted on allowing Indians to take the education test in their native languages and on lowering the property qualification. Despite this, in the elections of 1886 there were only 4,061 registered voters, including only 295 of Asian origin, out of a population of 359,419 (per the 1881 census). A prospective voter had to meet one of six property qualifications:Constitutional Evolution of Mauritius: From British Rule to Independence Government of Mauritius. #Ownership of immovable property of annual value Rs300 #Ownership of movable property of Rs3,000 #Payment of a monthly rent of at least Rs25 #Drawing a monthly salary of at least Rs50 #Paying an annual licence duty of at least Rs200 #Being husband of a wife or eldest son of a widow who meets one of qualifications #1–3 In 1889, Pope Hennessy in a letter to the colonial office, remarked that \\"no one in this Country doubts that the former Constitution was a better one than the present Government by an oligarchy of 4,201 voters.\\" The 1885 constitution replaced the constitution of 1831 remained in force until 1948, when the constitution of 1947 came into effect. The 1885 constitution was amended on 11 September 1913 and again on 18 April 1933. The latter amendment increased the proportion of appointed councilors who had to be non-officials from one third to two thirds (from three to six).

A recent view is that his approach to agriculture belongs to the early ideas on political economy.Newell, Margaret E.. 1995. \\"Robert Child and the Entrepreneurial Vision: Economy and Ideology in Early New England\\". The New England Quarterly 68 (2). The New England Quarterly, Inc.: 223–56. doi:10.2307/366257. Early life The son of John Child of Northfleet in Kent he was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He then attended the universities of Leiden and Padua, taking a medical degree at Leiden in 1635, and his M.D. at Padua in 1638. In New England Child did not practise medicine as a new graduate. In 1638 he travelled to New England, where his first stay lasted to 1641. There he came to know John Winthrop the younger, and a supporter of his ironworks project. Residing in Watertown, he joined the Nashaway Company, who were interested in iron ore; but left to go back to England. Moore writes that, during the period from 1641, Child worked in England using good contacts, trying to make New England self-sufficient in iron. He also travelled widely in continental Europe, meeting the alchemist Pierre Jean Fabre. On Child's return to New England in 1645, he was active in running the Saugus ironworks. He took an interest in the fur trade; he was also prospecting for a vineyard, but became involved in local politics and religious matters. This second visit ended in his departure in 1647, forced out as a Presbyterian. Child had taken part in agitation against the dominant Independents (congregationalists) in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, becoming the leader of the dissident Remonstrant group, who took their name from the \\"Remonstrance and Humble Petition\\" he wrote. Scholars disagree on its aims, but they included extending the Long Parliament's control across the Atlantic. The group of seven signatories included also Samuel Maverick (the others being Thomas Burton, lawyer at Hingham, John Dand, Thomas Fowle, John Smith and David Yale). Pamphlets on the case, in the Massachusetts General Court, appeared in 1647. New-England's Jonas cast up in London was by Child's brother John, a major in the parliamentary army. New England's Salamander was by Edward Winslow, who had been instructed to counter the arguments of the Remonstrants and Samuel Gorton. It has been suggested that the \\"Jonas\\" pamphlet was written by William Vassall. Alchemy Child shared with John Winthrop the younger, and Richard Leader of the Saugus works, an interest in alchemy arising from the metallurgy of iron. In the 17th century, a number of writers stated that Child was Eirenaeus Philalethes, the pseudonymous alchemist. That view was circulated by Johann Ferdinand Hertodt, among others.– It was incorrect, since the pseudonym concealed in fact his associate George Starkey from Massachusetts Bay Colony. Child, along with Benjamin Worsley, also took an interest in the chemical work of Johann Glauber. Among Child's chemical contacts was John French who wrote on distillation. He knew Robert Boyle well enough to introduce Starkey to him, in 1650. At that time he was also setting up a group including Thomas Henshaw, Thomas Vaughan and William Webbe, to gather and translate alchemical and chemical texts. Agriculture Child was an advocate of intensive cultivation over traditional agriculture. His views were expressed in The Defects and Remedies of English Husbandry (1652) and put him at odds with conventional wisdom, as represented by Walter Blith. He is now considered to have been ahead of his time. This work, known also as Child's \\"Large Letter\\", formed part of Samuel Hartlib His Legacie of 1651; others who contributed to the work include Cressy Dymock, Gabriel Plats (in the 1655 edition) and Richard Weston. The farming use of marl provoked a comment by Child published in the Legacie, suggesting that \\"husbandmen\\" should take an interest in what could be dug out of the ground. Samuel Hartlib was an intelligencer whose wide-ranging group of correspondents is now identified as the Hartlib Circle; Child had joined it by 1645. He was in agreement with other members of the Circle in approving of enclosures of land. Gerard and Arnold Boate's Ireland's Naturall History was representative of the Circle's interests, and took up Child's suggestion in a survey of \\"Metals, Minerals ...\\" in Ireland. Last years In 1651 Child was invited by Arthur Hill to his estate in Ulster. He remained there for the rest of his life, working on natural history and studying the agriculture of the area.

After her education, Adams worked in the medical field both at home in London and abroad in Egypt. In addition to her medical work, Adams was a noted lecturer at Medical Service Ministries, then known as the Missionary School of Medicine, and All Nations Bible College. A strong proponent of homeopathy and the autonomous nervous system, Adams dedicated a portion of her work to raising awareness and advocating for these fields. Adams left behind a significant legacy through her teaching, medical work, founding of various organizations, and publication of Neither Male nor Female: A Study of the Scriptures, an analysis of women in the Bible. Her legacy of organizations included a Christian school in Cornwall, a charitable trust for Christian rehabilitation of patients with mental health issues, and a nursing home in Reading, England.  Early life  Queenie Muriel Francis Adams was born on 7 May 1902 at Rose Cottage Stanmore in Hastings, Sussex, which is located on the south coast of England, and grew up in Little Stanmore, Middlesex. She was born to William Grylls Adams, who worked as a consulting engineer and patent agent, and Annie Louisa Kate Brothers. She had two older sisters, Winifred and Alice, and two younger siblings, John and Dorothy.  Education  In 1928, Adams enrolled in Redcliffe Missionary Training College, the first school to provide formal missionary training for women in England. As Adams was a devout Christian, the college's curriculum, which focused on specifically training students for Christian mission work, aligned well with her spiritual beliefs. About a decade later, Adams enrolled in the Missionary School of Medicine, where she took a one-year course on serving as a medical missionary worker. In contrast to her time at Redcliffe, Adams' education at MSM represented an informal course as she never took a public exam or received a certification that licensed her to work with programs sponsored by organizations other than MSM. Finally, in 1946, Adams was awarded a license to practise medicine by the Royal College of Physicians of London as one of thirty-two women who had passed the final examination in medicine, surgery, and midwifery.  Missionary work   Work with Children's Special Service Mission  At the age of 18, Queenie Adams joined the ranks of the Children's Special Service Mission, a Christian organization intended to bring children to the faith via the recommendations of their peers. Adams was engaged in CSSM's beach mission, in which volunteers go to popular vacation sites in efforts both to invite newcomers to the organization and to reinforce the spirituality of existing members.  Work in Egypt  Adams had a series of experiences as a religious, educational, and medical missionary in Egypt that were dispersed throughout her life. First, in 1931, she worked with the Church Mission to the Jews, now known as the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People, which sought to spread Christianity amongst the Jewish population. Later she taught at a mission college in Cairo named As-Salam College, also known as English Mission College. After her time at the Missionary School of Medicine in London, Adams returned to Egypt and worked for the Egyptian government during the cholera outbreak of 1948. While in Egypt, Adams had an experience with homeopathic treatment that resolved a fellow missionary's abscess; as a result she vowed to bring homeopathic treatment to London through teaching and publication.  Work in England   Public medicine  In 1937, Adams applied to be a physician at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London. As it was a teaching hospital, it required tuition which Adams did not have the means to pay. Fortunately, she received two scholarships, which in an interview she attributed to the grace of God. A hospital meant to provide free care to those without the financial means to go elsewhere, the Royal Free Hospital and its ideals tapped into Adams' altruistic spirit, ultimately inspiring some of her later work. Thirteen years later, she qualified to work at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, where she lectured on the topic of nervous diseases in addition to working as a physician.  Private medicine  Towards the middle of the 20th century, Adams started her own homeopathic practice in North London, in the sitting room of a local minister. She charged a fee of one shilling, but eventually decided to stop the practice as she thought it would be \\"frowned upon\\" by the Royal Free Hospital. During her work at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, Adams received a copy of Materia Medica, which inspired her to once again create a private homeopathic practice. The practice originated in Harley Street, but was so successful that it expanded to Reading, Hastings, Wimborne, and Bournemouth. In the same spirit as the Royal Free Hospital, Adams reduced her fees to provide treatment to those who otherwise would not have been able to afford it. In 1965, Adams moved herself and her practice to Cornwall, where she came highly recommended and was described by a fellow doctor as \\"brilliant, unconventional, and limitlessly kind.\\" Adams' last position as a physician was at PYE Barn Limited in Cornwall, where she worked from 17 January 1992 until her resignation on 7 February 1996, a little more than a year before her death.  Teaching  Adams returned to the Missionary School of Medicine, one of her alma maters, in the 1950s to serve as a teacher in general medicine with an emphasis on her overseas work in Egypt. Later she also taught Tropical Medicine at All Nations Bible College.

She attended school in England, being educated at a convent in London and she finished her schooling in France. Her mother died whilst on the RMS Titanic, the cruise ship that struck a large iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean on its maiden voyage in 1912. Career in Britain Cardin worked in the technical area of film-making before joining Movietone and Ealing studios in Britain. After a stage career, Maggie took up film jobs at Kay Film Laboratories and, later on, began free-lance editing in most studios in England. Her very first feature film to assist in was Edge of the World (1937), a film about the evacuation of the Scottish archipelago of St. Kilda, for Michael Powell. She had worked with many well-known film personalities in England, including Carol Reed, Thorald Dickinson, Paul Rotha, John Taylor, Sydney Box, Havelock Allan, Ronnie Neane Wallis, Joe Rock, David Leane, Herbert Wilcox and Alfred Hitchcock. In 1939, Cardin was working with the BBC as a TV film editor at Alexandra Palace. During the war years, however, she was working as a film librarian. She was seconded for a year to the Dutch Government, Stratton House, to edit Glorious Colours, a WWII propaganda film made in 1943. She was asked to edit this movie in both English and Dutch. Margaret left the BBC in 1945 and commenced the Cardin Film Service, working for I.C.I (Imperial Chemical Industries) and Shell. Career in Australia Margaret arrived in Australia in 1951, six years after the war had ended, but she had no intention on staying. She was soon, however, editing Captain Thunderbolt (1953), a film directed by Cecil Holmes about a bushranger of the same name. She also assisted the reputed ‘father of Australian documentary film’ John Heyer on what was his most successful film The Back of Beyond (1995). She also did some post-synchronizing for well-known film studio Pagewood and many short films as well. Her biggest move to properly begin her career as a film editor was when she joined the ABC in 1956. In an interview, she said that Neil Hutchinson, who was the Head of Drama reached out to her. She commenced work with the ABC on 17 September 1956 and was the first editor to be employed by the company at Gore Hill, a suburb in Northern Sydney. One of her strengths, in particular, was negative cutting and she was showing other members of the film staff what to do and how to do it. The year of 1956 is also the company set up the Film Library, which are the archives of the ABC. While working with the ABC, she worked closely with John Crews (News Department), John Appleton (Head of Children’s Programs) and Kay Kinnane (Head of Education). She didn’t go out in the field like the reporters did, but she would, instead, give advice to film cinecamera staff and others about putting together a film story. She left the ABC in 1959 after only working there for three years. In the same interview, she said: \\"I found that the ABC was a bit slow for me. Also I did not like the workplace politics that was there. I was just too impatient.\\" The following year, in 1960, she established her own film editing business. After establishing her own business, she went on to the most successful period of her career, to work as a negative cutter on such films as Mad Max (1979), My Brilliant Career (1979) and Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975).

Dr. Mary Pierson Eddy (1864-1923) was a religious and medical missionary. She was born in Syria to American missionary parents. Dr. Eddy followed in her parents' footsteps to become a medical missionary in the Middle East. She was the first woman to obtain a license to practice medicine in the Ottoman Empire. Dr. Eddy spent most of her missionary career traveling among remote villages of Syria until her death at age 59. Her family is credited with the success of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Syria. Early life Dr. Mary Eddy was born in Sidon, Lebanon on September 21, 1864, the fourth child out of five of William Woodbridge and Hannah Eddy (née Condit). Mary, along with siblings William and Harriet, followed their parents' examples and became missionaries in the Middle East. The eldest child, William, continued his parents' missionary practice in Sidon until he died in 1906. Harriet, the eldest daughter, also became a missionary. She worked in Sidon before continuing her mission in Beirut. Their sibling Robert is the only child of the Eddys to live in the United States, where he was a physician in New Rochelle, New York. The Eddys also had a fifth child, Ms. Julia Woodbridge Eddy, but little is known about her.Hewitt, John Haskell.

New York Times (1857-1922) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/95959544 In November 1851, William Eddy sailed with his wife to Syria with the American Board missionaries to begin a lifelong missionary career. After arriving in Syria, William and Hannah remained in Syria for 48 years, spending time in Aleppo, but mostly in Beirut and Sidon(present-day Lebanon). During their time in Syria, the Eddys established various seminaries, schools, and churches.  Education  At 16, Eddy went to the United States for the first time to complete her studies, as is common among missionary families. Eddy attended school in Philadelphia for 2 years before studying at Elmira College in upstate New York. She returned to Syria in 1883 after sustaining an injury due to a fall.Fleischmann, E.

Eddy moved to in 1903 upon her return from her third trip to the United States, located in present- day Lebanon  Background  In 1888, Eddy became seriously ill with burning fever. At just twenty-two years old, friends and family feared for her life until her fever broke. Because of this illness, Mary decided to become a physician. Dr. Eddy subsequently returned to New York in 1890 to study medicine. She completed her studies sometime around 1892 and was appointed as a missionary to Syria by the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. In 1893, Dr. Eddy left New York and traveled to Istanbul to obtain a medical license from the Ottoman Empire. When questioned by Turkish officials of the Imperial Council about her origins and background, she responded in Arabic, \\"I am of you and from among you.\\" Officials were stunned and proceeded to examine her medical knowledge for six hours before approving her as a physician of the Ottoman Empire.  Work in Syria  Dr. Mary Eddy began her missionary work in November 1893.Fleischmann, E. (1998) ‘Our Moslem sisters': Women of Greater Syria in the eyes of American protestant missionary women, Islam and Christian–Muslim Relations, 9:3, 307-323 Although she worked under the American Protestant missionaries, Dr. Eddy's main focus was not to proselytize but to heal. She founded eye clinics, hospitals, and a tuberculosis sanatorium. Unlike other missionaries of her time, Dr. Eddy traveled frequently throughout her mission. She set up clinics in tents and reached a great number of patients. In one instance, Dr. Eddy saw more than 500 new patients and performed over 40 eye operations in a single day. Dr. Eddy continued her mission for more than 20 years and faced many unorthodox situations. She contracted malaria, was swept out to sea, almost shipwrecked a trip from Beirut to Syria, and slept in a mud hut among other people and animals, among other hardships.  Death  Stress, exhaustion, and overwork contributed to Dr. Eddy's serious health problems. In 1914, she suffered a stroke and lost her eyesight. From then on, Eddy's health slowly deteriorated. A few years before her death, Dr. Eddy was hospitalized in the United States. In 1916, she wrote, \\"I don't know what the future has in store. I only wish I had a home on this globe.\\" Eddy's wish was to return to her place of birth before her death. In 1922, and accompanied by her sister Harriet, Eddy returned to the Middle East. Dr. Eddy died, blind and invalid, at age 59.  Legacy  Mary Eddy was born in Syria to religious missionary parents. She was fluent in Arabic and very familiar with the culture of her patients. However, Dr. Eddy was a complex character in that while she desired to serve her patients, she also at times was critical of them. In correspondence with friends, she remarked that the \\"natives\\" had a \\"lack of moral sense\\" and described them as \\"Black and uncomely with no redeeming qualities of the mind and body.\\" Despite this, Dr. Eddy genuinely cared for the physical and spiritual wellbeing of her patients, as seen through her commitment to serve despite hardships and personal illness. Dr. Eddy felt as if she was neither Syrian nor American. The only times Eddy visited the United States was for her schooling and for her health treatments. Although she was more at home in Syria, she still at times held Syrians in contempt. Until her death, Eddy felt as if she had \\"no home\\" on Earth. Rather, she felt as if she had a calling to evangelize and heal before reaching her home in heaven.

The groom's crown traditionally has a golden peacock on the top and he carries a small sword. The bride remains fully veiled. :*Airos are five or seven married women with their husbands alive. They perform the Chan-Bila Akawa, invite the deities to attend the wedding and bless the newly married couple and help the priest in performing the wedding. :*Dhunimao and Dhunibap ceremonially performs the marriage and act acts as the guardian in the wedding. :*Mita' is the formal witness the marriage and becomes a lifelong friend of the married couple. :*Udhika'ri is the priest who performs the formal marriage rites. The Udhikâri is now mostly substituted by a Hindu Brahmin. :*Gita'lus are people who sing songs that depicts the marriage of Shib Dyao and Parbuti Dyao and story of Bihulâ and Lukkhindǒr.Hajong, B. (2002). The Hajongs and their struggle. Assam, Janata Press. p. 31. Traditional marriage rituals Proposal When an unmarried boy's parents found a potential daughter-in-law, they then go to the girl's house with a Jahu whose job was to assuage the conflict of interests and general embarrassments when discussing the possibility of marriage on the part of two families largely unknown to each other. Bride price At this point the bridegroom's family arranged the matchmaker(Jahu or Jasu) to present a bride price to the bride's family. Arranging the wedding Before wedding ceremony, two families would arrange a wedding day according to Hajong calendar. Selecting an auspicious day to assure a good future for the couple is as important as avoiding what is believed to be an unlucky day. The wedding is not held on the birth day of both the bride and the groom. Invitation The groom's family invites people like the Airos, Dhunimao and Dhunibap who are essential for performing the marriage rites. They are invited by giving betel nuts and betel leaves. Traditionally wedding ceremonies were held in the groom's house. Wedding ceremony The final ritual would be the actual wedding ceremony where bride and groom become a married couple, which consists of many elaborate parts and the rituals takes place for three to five days: Chan-Bila Akawa The actual wedding rituals start by making the Birapat-Chhita' during the Chan-Bila Akawa ritual. The airos make sun, moon, birds and palanquins on a bamboo screen and paint auspicious symbols on earthen lamps and pottery. Udhiba's The airos ritually invite the gods, to attend the wedding and bless the newly married couple, by lighting a lamp in the name of the deity. Paper cuttings with elaborate designs are hung on the doors . Wedding procession The wedding procession from the bride's home to the groom's home consists of a traditional band and the airǒs. Picking the bride from her house, traditionally in a palanquin, the airǒs along with the jahu and the mitâ heads towards the grooms's residence. Welcoming the bride The wedding procession stops at the door of the groom's home. There are ceremonies to be followed to welcome the groom and her wedding procession into the groom's home, which varies from place to place. Gon Suwaba The bride and the groom are ritually purified and a red thread is tied on their waists by the airos before the bhor bya'. Bhor bya' Bhor bya' is the actual wedding ceremony equivalent to exchanging vows in the west, it is an elaborate ritual and is held at the night. The couple would pay respect to wedding deities, the patron family deities, paying respect to deceased ancestors and the bride and groom's parents and other elders. Basi bya' or Bahi bya' It is the second half of the wedding and is performed in the next morning. Wedding banquets In Hajong society, the wedding banquet is known as Bi'â-khawa. There are ceremonies such as the bride and groon eating together sharing the side dishes. Traditionally, the bride's father is responsible for the cost of the wedding invitation sweet treats, the banquet invitations, and the wedding itself. Wedding banquets are elaborate and consist usually of 5–10 courses and turtle meat is considered auspicious for wedding banquets as it symbolizes long life. Traditionally, the father of the bride is responsible for the wedding banquet hosted on the bride's side and the alcohol consumed during both banquets. The wedding banquets are two separate banquets: the primary banquet is hosted once from the bride's side, the second banquet is at the groom's side, for which the groom's family takes the expenses of the banquet. While the wedding itself is often based on the couple's choices, the wedding banquets are a gesture of thanks and appreciation, to those that have raised the bride and groom (such as grandparents and uncles). It is also to ensure the relatives on each side meet the relatives on the other side. Polygamy Polygamy is very rare among the Hajongs. Traditional Hajong culture does not prohibit nor explicitly encourage polygamy, except as a way to obtain male children. Remarriage Widows are allowed to remarry in the Hajong society and this type of marriage is called Hang'a or Sang'a in Hajong. This marriage is mostly performed for young widows by her inlaws or the village headman.Hajong, B. (2002). The Hajongs and their struggle. Assam, Janata Press. p. 30.

It is the fourth installment in the Predator franchise. Black had a supporting role in the original film, while John Davis returns as producer from the first three installments. Starring Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn, Thomas Jane, Alfie Allen, and Sterling K. Brown, it follows a group of PTSD-afflicted soldiers and a scientist who must team up to fight off an invading pair of Predators and discover their plans for mankind. Talks of a new Predator installment began in June 2014, with Black being confirmed as writer and director; much of the cast signed on between October 2016 and January 2017. Filming took place in British Columbia from February to June 2017, with the entire climax being re-written and re-shot in July 2018 following poor test screenings. The Predator premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 14, 2018, by 20th Century Fox, in IMAX and Dolby Cinema, as well as standard formats. The film received mixed reviews but went on to earn $160 million worldwide, becoming the highest- grossing film in the franchise. Plot A Predator ship crash-lands on Earth. U.S. Army Ranger sniper Quinn McKenna and his team are attacked by the Predator while on a hostage retrieval mission. McKenna incapacitates the Predator and has parts of its armor sent by mail to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life. At the behest of government agent Will Traeger, he is captured and held for examination. Traeger also takes the Predator to a lab for experimentation and observation, recruiting evolutionary biologist Casey Bracket to study it. The Predator awakes, breaks out of its restraints, kills lab workers and armed guards, but spares Bracket, the only unarmed person, before leaving. McKenna is bussed off with a group of other government captives, including former Marines Gaylord \\"Nebraska\\" Williams, Coyle, Baxley, Lynch, and Army helicopter pilot Nettles. Seeing the Predator escape from the lab firsthand, they hijack the bus. Taking Bracket with them, they head over to McKenna's estranged wife, Emily, where he expects to find the Predator armor he mailed off. However, Rory, McKenna's son with autism has gone trick- or-treating while wearing this armor in hopes of avoiding detection from bullies. McKenna and the others find his son just in time to stop a pair of Predator hounds (from Predators) from ambushing the boy. McKenna kills one of the dogs by shooting a grenade into its mouth, causing the dog to explode. Nebraska accidentally lobotomizes the other dog after shooting it in the head. The Predator chases them into a nearby school. They start to give the Predator's armor back when another, much larger Predator arrives and engages the first in combat. The group flee, and the second Predator kills the first Predator before setting out to retrieve the lost technology. Bracket concludes that the Predators are attempting to improve themselves with the DNA of humans and, presumably, other planets' inhabitants. The team flees to an abandoned barn, but Traeger finds them, captures them, and shares his theory that the Predators anticipate that climate change will end their ability to retrieve human DNA for further hybridization, so they are scrambling to retrieve it before it is too late. Seeing Rory drawing a map to the spaceship, Traeger takes the boy away to go to the ship. The team escapes and goes after him with the help of the now docile, brain-damaged Predator dog. When all are at the crashed Predator ship, the second Predator arrives, kills Lynch, and explains through translation software that it will blow up the ship to keep it out of their hands and then give them all a head start before it hunts them down. The Predator quickly kills several of Traeger's soldiers while mortally wounding both Baxley and Coyle, who then euthanise each other. Traeger tries to use a Predator weapon on the alien but accidentally kills himself in the process. The Predator takes Rory, believing that his autism reflects advancement in human evolution and is therefore worthwhile in the Predator hybridization, and flies away in his ship. McKenna, Nebraska, and Nettles land on the ship's exterior, but the Predator activates a force field. This slices Nettles' legs off, and he falls off of the ship to his death. Nebraska sacrifices himself and slides into the ship's turbine, causing it to crash. McKenna sneaks into the ship as it crashes and attacks the Predator. After the crash, Bracket arrives, and the three manage to overpower and kill the Predator with its own weapons. They pay their respects to their fallen comrades with trinkets representing each one before heading off. Some time later, McKenna and Rory are seen in a science lab watching the opening of cargo found on the Predator's ship, which a scientist indicates was left behind on purpose. A piece of technology floats out and attaches itself to a lab worker, working as a transformative \\"Predator killer\\" suit before deactivating. Cast * Boyd Holbrook as Quinn McKenna, Emily's estranged husband, the father of Rory and an Army Ranger Captain who discovers the existence of the Predators and leads the battle against them. * Trevante Rhodes as Nebraska Williams, a former Marine officer who joins in a special Predator-hunting operation headed up by Quinn and becomes his closest ally. * Jacob Tremblay as Rory McKenna, Quinn and Emily's son, who has a form of autism and is bullied in school, but becomes a key player in the fight against the Predators due to his preternatural ability to learn languages. * Keegan-Michael Key as Coyle, a Marine veteran, who teams up with Quinn and Williams to fight the Predators. * Olivia Munn as Casey Bracket, an evolutionary biologist who joins the crew's mission. * Sterling K. Brown as Will Traeger, a government agent and Director of the \\"Stargazer Project\\" who jails Quinn, but later needs his help with fighting the Predators. * Thomas Jane as Baxley, a Marine veteran from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. His character was named after Craig R. Baxley, the stunt coordinator of the 1987 film. * Alfie Allen as Lynch, a former Marine who teams with several other outsiders, including Quinn, to stop the human-hunting Predators in suburbia. * Augusto Aguilera as Nettles, a former Huey helicopter pilot and religious zealot who has suffered a traumatic brain injury from a crash. * Jake Busey as Sean Keyes, a head Stargazer scientist, the son of Peter Keyes (played by Busey's father Gary Busey in Predator 2). * Yvonne Strahovski as Emily, Quinn McKenna's estranged wife and the mother to Rory.

General Marks, Nikolas Dukic as Derek, Gabriel LaBelle as EJ, Niall Matter as Sapir, Mike Dopud as Dupree, and Garry Chalk as a postal worker. The Predators were portrayed in-suit and via motion capture by stuntmen Brian A. Prince and Kyle Strauts, with vocal work by Brian A. Prince. Actress Françoise Yip, who briefly appears as Cullen, an operative of \\"Project Stargazer\\", previously appeared in Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem as Ms. Yutani. Stuntwoman Breanna Watkins, in scenes that were filmed but not used, portrayed Ellen Ripley in one alternate ending, and an adult Rebecca \\"Newt\\" Jorden in a second alternate ending, meant to tie in to the Alien franchise in which those characters first appeared. Edward James Olmos had a supporting role as a military general, but his scenes were cut due to time constraints. Production Pre-production In June 2014, Fox announced a sequel. Shane Black, who also starred as supporting character Rick Hawkins in Predator, directed, and co-wrote with Fred Dekker, while John Davis produced. Davis has said of the film that he thinks it is fresh and reimagines the franchise in a \\"different, interesting way\\". In February 2016, Black stated that the title of the new sequel would be The Predator. He has referred to the project as an event film which aims to elevate the Predator series: \\"It's an attempt to 'event-ise' the Predator again... [An attempt to] make it more mysterious.\\" Black also expressed that the film would mark a return to the \\"intimate\\" scale of the original film and that the filmmakers hoped to achieve “the same sense of wonderment and newness that Close Encounters had when that came out.” The film is set in the present day and the titular character has upgraded armor. Black has said that he looked for plot details set up in the previous Predator movies that he could retrospectively link back to with the new film. To that end, Jake Busey was cast as Sean Keyes, the son of Peter Keyes (a character who was portrayed by Busey's father Gary Busey in Predator 2). In February 2016, the studio revealed a teaser image of the film, confirming the title The Predator. Chief-executive-officer of 20th Century Fox Stacey Snider shared her thoughts on The Predator and Shane Black and Fred Dekker's script: Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger talked with Black about reprising his role as Dutch Schaefer from the first Predator film, but declined the cameo due to the short role. Rapper 50 Cent also spoke of the possibility of being involved in the film but ended up dropping out. By September 2016, Benicio del Toro had signed on to star. The following month, Boyd Holbrook replaced del Toro, who departed due to scheduling issues. In November 2016, Olivia Munn joined the cast. In January 2017, Trevante Rhodes, Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling K. Brown, Thomas Jane and Jacob Tremblay joined the cast. In February, Alfie Allen and Yvonne Strahovski were added. In March, the last main role was filled by Augusto Aguilera while Jake Busey was also cast in a supporting role. In March 2017, Edward James Olmos was cast as Sanchez, a military general. In August 2018, Olmos announced that his role had been cut from the final film, to reduce the film's running time, as his character was not integral to the plot. Filming Filming was scheduled to begin in February 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia. On November 21, 2016, Larry Fong was confirmed hired as cinematographer for the film. Black announced that filming had begun on February 20, 2017. Additional photography in Vancouver took place in March 2018. Post-production The visual effects were provided by MPC, Atomic Fiction, Raynault VFX, Rising Sun Pictures and Proof. Music Henry Jackman provided the musical score for the film, which incorporates Alan Silvestri's themes from the 1987 film. The film's soundtrack album was released by Lakeshore Records on September 28, 2018. Release The Predator was originally scheduled by 20th Century Fox for a March 2, 2018, release date, until the date was moved to February 9, 2018. It was then delayed to August 3, 2018. In February 2018, the released date was delayed to September 14, 2018. The film's release included IMAX theaters. On May 10, 2018, the first trailer was released. A television spot was released on June 9, while a second full trailer was released on June 26, 2018. The third and final theatrical trailer was released on August 31, 2018, featuring the song \\"One Shot, One Kill\\" by Jon Connor featuring Snoop Dogg. The film's world premiere was at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2018, at the Ryerson Theatre. The film was later released in the US on September 14, 2018. Home media The Predator was released on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD formats on December 18, 2018 in America, alongside short film The Predator Holiday Special, in which Santa Claus and his elves and reindeer encounters a Predator at the North Pole. The film would eventually be released on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD formats on January 28, 2019 in the United Kingdom. The film's third act was originally set during the day; after the resulting sequences were deemed ineffective, they were largely reshot at night. Black wanted the home media release to include both versions of the film, Predator AM and Predator PM, but the studio declined, not wanting to pay to complete the daylight version's digital effects. Reception Box office The Predator grossed $51 million in the United States and Canada, and $109.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $160.5 million, against a production budget of $88 million. In the United States and Canada, The Predator was released alongside White Boy Rick, A Simple Favor and Unbroken: Path to Redemption, and was projected to gross $25–32 million from 4,037 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $10.5 million on its first day, including $2.5 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $24 million, finishing first at the box office but marking a lower start than the 2010 film ($24.8 million). It dropped 65% in its second weekend to $8.7 million, finishing fourth. In its third weekend the film grossed $3.9 million, finishing eighth. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 32% based on 287 reviews and an average rating of 4.99/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Predator has violence and quips to spare, but its chaotically hollow action adds up to another missed opportunity for a franchise increasingly defined by disappointment.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale, those on PostTrak gave it a 66% positive score and a 55% \\"definite recommend\\", and social media monitor RelishMix noted there were \\"mixed reactions\\" about the film online. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Jordan Mintzer called the film \\"bigger, meaner, gorier, funnier\\" than previous installments, writing, \\"Whether the world actually needs [a sequel], and whether this reboot was necessary at all, is probably a question worth raising, but at least Black's take on it is to never take it too seriously while keeping us duly entertained.\\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com praised the ensemble, pacing and Black's direction, writing, \\"Black is assisted greatly by an incredibly charismatic cast, and he knows how to use them to amplify their strengths.\\" A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club wrote \\"The Predator, which Black penned with Monster Squad co-writer and director Fred Dekker, makes a few concessions to modern blockbuster filmmaking, including an overabundance of CGI, a blatantly franchise-thirsty ending, and some winking references to the original. But the movie's values are more 1988 than 2018, and that's what makes it fun, at least in spurts: Black has captured the spirit of that bygone era of adrenaline-junkie junk without getting all retro-fussy about it.\\" He graded the film a B-. In a negative review, Dennis Harvey of Variety called it \\"an exhaustingly energetic mess in which a coherent plot and credible characters aren't even on the cluttered menu.\\" Writing for Nerdist, Katie Walsh called the film \\"messy, chaotic, and convoluted\\", adding that its \\"comedy and action are at war with each other. Characters spew rat-a-tat quips, while tussling with Predators and their pets, essentially neutralizing the effect of both the humor and the action.\\" Jonathan Barkan, writing for Dread Central, gave the film two out of five stars, saying, \\"Poor story choices and strange, if not outright silly, character decisions result in an experience that will ultimately leave audiences feeling a great amount of 'meh'.\\" Jim Vejvoda of IGN gave the film a 6.5 out of 10, saying, \\"The Predator does a lot right to reinvigorate the 31-year-old series. But everything crashes down during its frenzied, messy final act, a disappointing conclusion to what had largely been a fun romp up until that point.\\" Controversies Director Shane Black hired his longtime friend Steven Wilder Striegel (known professionally as \\"Steve Wilder\\") for a minor, un-auditioned role in The Predator (he had also appeared in Black's previous films Iron Man 3 and The Nice Guys). Wilder has been a registered felony sex offender since 2010, when he pleaded guilty to \\"enticing a minor by computer\\" after he attempted to lure a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship via email. A few days before picture lock on the film, Olivia Munn became aware of Wilder's history and approached Fox executives, insisting that the scene be removed. Black defended his casting decision and his friend, until later issuing a public apology and rescinding those comments amid backlash. Fox released a statement saying that they were unaware of Wilder's status and confirming that the scene had been cut from the film. Co-star Sterling K. Brown tweeted in support of Munn, but initially, most other actors on the film remained silent, releasing statements after mounting public pressure. The Predator suggests not only that autistic persons who exhibit savant qualities and other forms of neurodiversity are or were advantageous, but that they represent a forward step on the human evolutionary path. According to the scientific opinions reported by Syfy Wire, such a thesis would have some issues. Also the New York Post review ends by stating: \\"But worse is a plot line involving autism and a dubious scientific theory that will leave parents fuming.\\" In a review for Uproxx, Emma Stefansky called the film's depiction of autism, \\"maybe the worst thing I have seen in a film this year\\" and scolds the filmmakers for their depiction of mental illness, especially the idea that \\"autism = really smart\\". Other media Books The Predator received a novelization co-written by Christopher Golden and Mark Morris, with the audiobook narrated by James Patrick Cronin.https://www.amazon.com/Predator-Official-Movie- Novelization/dp/1785658050/ref=tmm_mmp_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid;=1571512083&sr;=8-1 It also received a prequel novel titled The Predator: Hunters and Hunted written by James A.

About this, Black said: \\"I would love to say we've been planning a trilogy, but I take it one day at a time; in motion-picture terms that's one movie at a time.\\" See also * List of monster movies References External links  Official franchise website * Official Fan Community Site *The Predator at Box Office Mojo The Predator at Metacritic *The Predator at Rotten Tomatoes * 2018 films 2018 science fiction action films 2010s adventure films 2010s monster movies 2010s science fiction horror films 2010s science fiction comedy films 2010s comedy horror films American films American monster movies American science fiction action films American science fiction adventure films American science fiction horror films American sequel films Davis Entertainment films Films about autism Halloween horror films Films directed by Shane Black Films produced by John Davis Films scored by Henry Jackman Films set in 2018 Films set in Georgia (U.S. state) Films set in Johns Hopkins University Films set in Los Angeles Films set in Mexico Films set in New Mexico Films set in Tennessee Films shot in Vancouver Predator (franchise) films Films with screenplays by Shane Black 20th Century Fox films Films about extraterrestrial life 2018 comedy films ","title":"The Predator (film)"},{"id":"48705685","text":"Exterior view Entrance View from the monastery Vlatades Monastery or Vlatadon Monastery () is a monastery in Ano Poli, Thessaloniki, Greece.

During his career he edited over 40 feature films, and over a dozen television series. His work earned him an Emmy nomination and two Eddie Awards. Career Cahoon's film career began at Universal Studios with his work on the 1929 William Wyler melodrama, The Shakedown. It was one of five films he would work on that year, including the comedy, The Cohens and Kellys in Atlantic City, In 1930, Cahoon became engaged to Margaret Pickstone. In the 1930s, some of the notable films on which he worked include: the Technicolor film Mamba (1930), starring Jean Hersholt; the World War I drama, The Mad Parade (1931), with a cast consisting entirely of women; the 1931 B film drama, Men in Her Life; Air Hostess, a 1933 melodrama directed by Albert Rogell; the 1934 drama Whirlpool, starring Jack Holt and Jean Arthur; two 1934 features starring Fay Wray, Black Moon and Once to Every Woman; the 1935 aviation drama, Air Hawks, which featured Wiley Post in his only screen performance; the 1935 adaptation of the Russian classic of the same name, Crime and Punishment, directed by Josef von Sternberg; and The Mysterious Avenger (1936), a B-film directed by David Selman and starring Charles Starrett. After 1936, Cahoon's career cooled off a bit, and he would only edit 3 films between 1936 and the end of the 1940s, including the final two films in the Scattergood Baines film series: Scattergood Survives a Murder and Cinderella Swings It. In the mid-1950s, Cahoon reinvigorated his career. After editing the Maureen O'Hara and Anthony Quinn film, The Magnificent Matador in 1955, he began working in the medium for which he achieved his greatest success: television. That same year he would edit the premier episode of the short-lived television series, Luke and the Tenderfoot, titled \\"The Boston Kid\\". After editing The Indian Fighter, starring Kirk Douglas and Walter Matthau, and Navy Wife, starring Joan Bennett, Gary Merrill, and Shirley Yamaguchi, Cahoon would spend the remainder of his career focusing on the small screen. After working on several television shows in the mid and late 1950s, including You Are There, Broken Arrow, How to Marry a Millionaire, and Tombstone Territory, Cahoon spent 9 years editing Perry Mason, for which he worked during the entire run of the series. In 1961, Cahoon would be nominated for an Emmy for his editing on the series, although he would lose to the editors of the Naked City. During the rest of the 1960s he would work on several other television series, including Twelve O'Clock High, The Fugitive, and I Spy. His final editing position was on the television series, Medical Center, for which he would win two Eddie Awards, in 1971 and 1972.

Kathmandu, Nepal: Government of Nepal Ministry of Agriculture. Great potential lies in the expansion and commercialization of the cocoyam industry, enabling this subsistence and cash crop to become a source of economic stability for many hillside farmers. Cocoyams have a tuberous root (corm), which is surrounded by potato-size tubers referred to as cormels. The cormels are consumed as food and the leaves and shoots eaten as a nutritious vegetable in many stews and ethnic dishes, while the corms are used for replanting and animal feed. Due to the crop’s versatility, investing in the production of cocoyams would not only provide Nepalese farmers with a source of income from selling the cormels for cocoyam chip production, but would provide sustenance for themselves as well as feed for their livestock. Cocoyams are capable of yielding 30 to 60 tonnes of cormels per hectare,Production crops. (2014, August 4).

Retrieved November 24, 2015, from CGIAR website: http://www.rtb.cgiar.org/cocoyams-potential-for-nutrition-and-income-still- untapped/ As cocoyam production is generally an informal activity driven by women on small scale farms, the commercialization and investment in this crop would significantly impact the most vulnerable groups in Nepal. According to a 2005 study carried out by the FAO, women in the high mountainous regions of Nepal contribute more in agricultural production than their male counterpart. In order to benefit female hillside farmers, the commercialization of cocoyam would require an increase in women’s access to development opportunities in order to maintain their control over farms. In the high hills and mountainous regions of Nepal the cultivation of land and transport of crops is carried out by livestock such as oxen.Parlyar, D. (2005, September).

CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB). For a Nepalese hillside farmer, selling surplus cocoyam to locals presents challenges due to the crop’s higher selling point. However, if cocoyam was to be commercialized and exported overseas, the higher value of the crop would instead benefit Nepalese farmers as they would experience higher revenues than the previous mentioned root crops.Annual producer prices.

Retrieved December 1, 2015, from FAO website: http://faostat.fao.org/site/703/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=703#ancor Due to current land ownership and tenancy rights in Nepal, land rents require 50% of all agro production to be given to the landowner. According to Hindu law, male offspring come into ownership of parental land holdings. In order for cocoyam cultivation to be economically sustainable and beneficial to female farmers, land reform and public policy would have to shift towards a more gender equal practice of agriculture.  Environment  In a commercialized setting where cocoyams require mass cultivation, the problem of pests and diseases will increase in severity. Cocoyam root rot disease and taro leaf blight are common to cocoyam crops. These diseases can exceed one growing season due to the cocoyam’s propagation method of transmitting diseases onto the next generation, sometimes resulting in yield losses of up to 100%. Therefore, in order for cocoyam to become commercialized, Nepalese farmers need to be educated in disease prevention and given the proper inputs to eliminate the occurrence of the spread of disease. Cocoyam grows best in the mountainous and hill regions of Nepal, accounting for a combined 65% of all arable land. Although inputs such as fertilizer are increasingly important for intensive crop cultivation in these regions, manure remains the central source of soil fertility and nutrient replenishment. The mass production of cocoyam in this region would require chemical fertilizers rather than manure. The current system of land ownership in Nepal produces a short-term focus on land investment and production, ignoring long-term investments such as terracing and tree planting to avoid soil erosion and the use of fertilizers. The commercialization of cocoyam would require long-term investment in land and soil to enable mass production and sustainability.

It is a prominent mountain, some 3.5 km north-east of Mont Blanc, but is effectively part of a continuation of the south eastern spur of Mont Maudit (l'Arete de la Brenva) which forms a frontier ridge between the two countries. It is easily accessible to mountaineers and provides not only a very good viewpoint from its summit of the Brenva face and the major peaks on the southern side of Mont Blanc, but it also offers a popular introduction to alpine climbing of all grades, including a north face ascent. First Ascents * First ascent by J.Backhouse, T. Carson, Douglas Freshfield and C. Tucker with Daniel Balleys and Michel Payot, 22 July 1867. * First ascent of the North face was by F. Gonella and A. Berthod on 23 August 1886. * First winter ascent: U. Mautino with J. Petigax and C. Croux, c.1895 Viewpoint Tour Ronde – Couloir Gervasutti View along L'Arete de la Brenva (Kufner Ridge) towards Mont Maudit from Bivouac de la Fourche The relatively isolated but easily accessible summit of the Tour Ronde has a reputation for providing mountaineers with one of the finest viewpoints within the Mont Blanc range, and offers an ideal place for observing the sun rising on Mont Blanc itself. To the north it offers extensive views over the wide and heavily crevassed Géant Glacier () and the Vallée Blanche towards the Aiguille du Midi, whilst looking westwards it provides very extensive views towards Mont Maudit and the full sweep of the Brenva Face of Mont Blanc and the Peuterey Ridge. Writing about the first ascensionist's impression of the view from the summit of the Tour Ronde, one author quoted Douglas Freshfield in volume 6 of The Alpine Journal (1874), thus: Access The Tour Ronde can be most easily reached within about 1.5 hours from the Torino Hut near Pointe Helbronner, where mountaineers spend the night before leaving, usually well before dawn, to ascend the summit early the next day. Alternate and longer routes can be made from the Refuge des Cosmiques at the Col du Midi via a passage across the head of the Vallee Blanche and the Géant Glacier (or from Chamonix via the Aiguille du Midi and the Vallée Blanche Aerial Tramway). Pointe Helbronner can also be reached from the Italian side on foot or via cablecar from Courmayeur. Other even longer start or finish points include the Requin Hut above Montenvers, reached by a long but impressive glacier trek. Routes The mountain provides many routes of ascent, and of varying difficulty and danger, as well as opportunities for possible new routes of mixed climbing. Classic mountaineering routes on the Tour Ronde include: * South-east Ridge: One of two normal (i.e. easy) routes of ascent from the Torino Hut, offering a good introduction to alpine mountaineering at an easy grade of PD to PD+. *East Face: Very popular route of ascent, especially when snow conditions are good earlier in the season. PD to PD+ * North Face: A well-established and classic route, very popular amongst mountaineers as a good introduction to alpine north-face climbing. Graded at AD+ to D-, dependent upon conditions, the route has an average angle of around 52° and the summit takes around 4 hours or more to reach from the Torino Hut. The route's difficulties are being mainly in overcoming the initial bergschrund and the moving from the lower to the upper ice field. By keeping to the right hand side of the slope climbers are able to utilise rock belays for much of the climb. Dangers involve rock and ice fall, and an early start is necessary to ensure good snow conditions as the face does get exposed to the sun later in the day. * North Couloir: An alternate and steeper route with an angle around 60° which is sometimes used by competent parties when the more popular North face is overcrowded. * Gervasutti Couloir: A popular, classic snow-ice couloir at an angle of just less than 50°. When in good condition, this route, graded at AD, does get used in descent, both by climbers and by skiers. First climbed by G. Gervasutti and R.Chabod on 27 July 1934. (pictured) *Couloir Rebuffat. Narrow ice-couloir, D+ * North-east Ridge Direct. Other new mixed climbing ascents routes have also been achieved in recent years although, because of the mountain's popularity and accessibility, it can be difficult to determine whether the routes are actually new or not. Events and incidents Tour Ronde – North face, showing lower and upper icefields * 1971 July 20. First descent on skis of North Face, by Patrick Vallençant. * 1979 July 18. Accident occurred killing 8 climbers and injuring 4. Amongst the dead were four climbers from The RAE climbing club in Farnborough, Hampshire, including John A Williams and Chris Hassell. Christopher Marsh, who slipped and fell whilst the climbers were descending, was initially put on trial for causing the accident. However, all charges were subsequently dropped by the Annecy courts. * 1997 The six-year-old son of a British climber, Gerry Hedley, successfully sued a mountain guide, David Cuthbertson, for negligence after a fatal accident that took place seven years previously in July 1990 during an ascent of the north face. He was awarded £150,000 of damages by the High Court after the judge concluded that use of a single ice screw during the roped ascent had not been sufficient to protect the client when the guide fell when a slab of snow or ice broke away beneath him, pulling them both down the face. The guide was injured and the client was killed in the fall. The guide's professional association later vindicated Cuthbertson; this case is often used as an example and discussed in detail in legal textbooks dealing with tort law and sports education. * 2009 May 29. Olympic Champion snowboarder and aspirant mountain guide Karine Ruby was killed at age 31 whilst leading a descent of the Tour Ronde. Ruby fell into a in the Géant Glacier, dragging in two other members of the roped climbing party, one of whom was killed and the other sustained serious injuries and was evacuated by helicopter. * 2015 January. A British skier died in a fall after losing a ski during a descent of the North Face. * 2018 June 3. A well-known French plastic surgeon, Dr Armelle Chichery, was killed at age 42 during the ascent of the North Face. Climate change, permafrost and rockfall In 2005 the Tour Ronde became the first high mountain ever to be subject to extremely detailed laser-scanning and monitoring. Amid growing concern in recent decades that climate change had been increasing the incidence of severe rock-fall and loss of permafrost at high altitude, a study was launched to monitor potentially unstable rock faces and to assess changes over time. Previous techniques had used aerial photography and digital elevation modelling (DEM), but were deemed not to be sufficiently accurate to monitor change because of the vertical viewpoint and shadowing effects, plus the general coarse nature of their results. By 2005 the newly-evolving technique of Light Detection and Ranging, known as LiDAR, permitted highly detailed laser scanning of high mountain rock faces, measuring many thousands of separate points every second, and from a distance of up to 800 metres. An EU Interreg–funded project was established to undertake research. Known as PERMAdataROC, its aims were to \\"improve our understanding of the relationship between permafrost degradation and slope instabilities by quantifying the occurrence and magnitude of rock falls from high-mountain rock walls\\". Seven sites in the Mont Blanc Massif were selected, with the east face of the Tour Ronde being the first to be analysed. Measurements were taken in July 2005 and again in July 2006. An area of the east face of 67,400 m² was laser-scanned, creating 22 overlapping computer images, with measurements accurate to between 3 and 5 cm. Careful computer analysis revealed that in the twelve-month period between scans, the measured area had lost 536 m³ of rock. This is comparable to an erosion rate across the entire measured area of the face of 8.4 mm per year – a figure significantly greater than those found in rock walls of high-altitude permafrost in Switzerland and Greenland. The project concluded that the higher rock fall rate exhibited on the Tour Ronde and elsewhere in the Mont Blanc massif was linked to the degradation in permafrost which would have held the mountain together more effectively, but which now exposed it to greater weathering through the freeze-thaw cycle of water, with maximum occurrence during warm summers. In 2015 a huge rockfall on the Tour Ronde's east face was captured on film by climbers, demonstrating that instability in this mountain area remains at a significant level.

In 2011, Ramirez asked Alarcon if she could revitalize TWP project and resulted in the rebirth of TWP. Without Ramirez, the press would not have reopened or functioning as of today. She is also the First Core Collective Member is the first member of a national collective working that helped revive TWP. TWP was revived to honor and continue the legacy of women of color publishing. It has also published works by notable women of color such as Gloria Anzaldúa's Living Chicana Theory (1998), Cherrie Moraga's The Sexuality of Latinas (1993), Carla Trujillo's Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About (1991), Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Writing Self, Writing Nation: A Collection of Essays on Dictee by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha (1994) and Ana Castillo's The Sexuality of Latinas (co-editor, with Norma Alarcón and Cherríe Moraga) (1993). TWP believes that language, art, and media are tools for creating dynamic social change. The tools expand access to the work of activist scholars and artists dedicated to liberation from the historical injustices of colonialism and imperialism. They also encourage reader to collaborate with them to envisioning a world for women of color that incorporates migratory, diasporic, and indigenous women both within and beyond U.S. national borders.

The British East India Company (EIC) twice employed her as an \\"extra ship\\", first when she went out to India to sail in trade in that market, and again in 1803 when she sailed back from India to Britain. On her return to Britain the Admiralty purchased her in June 1804 and converted her to a 44-gun fifth rate with the name HMS Mediator. The Navy converted her to a storeship in 1808, but then expended her as a fireship at the battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809. Ann and Amelia After her launch at Whitby in 1781, Ann and Amelia, under the command of Captain John Popham, was at The Downs on 30 January 1782. She left British waters on 6 February 1781 for India. She was to remain there in the local and Far East trade.British Library: Ann and Amelia (1). She served as a transport or troopship to support Major-General Sir David Baird's expedition in 1800 to the Red Sea. Baird was in command of the Indian army that was going to Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there. Baird landed at Kosseir, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. He then led his troops army across the desert to Kena on the Nile, and then to Cairo. He arrived before Alexandria in time for the final operations. In 1803 the EIC employed Ann and Amelia again, this time to take a cargo from Bengal to Britain. She left Saugor on 29 January 1803. She reached Coringa on 27 February, and Madras on 11 March. She then reached St Helena on 10 July, and Yarmouth on 29 September, before arriving at The Downs on 3 October.British Library: Ann and Amelia (2). HMS Mediator In June–July 1804 Mediator underwent fitting by Brent, of Rotherhithe. Then she underwent further fitting between July and October, but at Deptford Dockyard. Her measurements, and hence burthen, increased. Captain Thomas Livingstone commissioned Mediator in August 1804 for the North Sea. Captain John Seater replaced Livingstone in January 1805, and on 25 February sailed towards the East Indies. Equally, on 17 February, Mediator escorted a convoy of Indiamen out of Portsmouth. She escorted them as far as St Helena and then returned to Britain in September. On 3 March 1806, Mediator and left Cork, escorting a convoy for the West Indies. The convoy was reported \\"all well\\" on 25 March at . In May 1806 Mediator was on the Jamaica Station. Seater died about that time,Naval Chronicle, Vol. 16, p.88. and Captain William Wise replaced him. On 14 November, Wise and Mediator captured West Indian. On 14 February 1807 Captain Wise and Mediator fell in with Bacchante, Commander James Dacres, in the Mona Passage. Dacres also had the French schooner Dauphin, which he had just captured. Mediator and Bacchante were patrolling, looking for French warships and privateers, so Dacres took Mediator under his command and hatched a plan to raid the port of Samana, \\"that nest of privateers\\". Dacres had Dauphin come into the harbour there under her French flag, with Bacchante disguised as her prize, and Mediator, a former merchantman, appearing to be a neutral ship. This stratagem permitted the British vessels to come into the harbour and anchor within a half a mile of the fort before the enemy realized that vessels were British warships. After a four-hour exchange of fire with a fort there, manned primarily by men from the privateers in the harbour, the fort fell to a land attack by the seamen and marines from Bacchante and Mediator, the landing party being under Wise's command. The British captured two French schooners undergoing fitting as privateers, and an American ship and a British schooner, both prizes to French privateers. Before they left on 21 February, the British destroyed the fort and its guns. In the attack, Dacres had four men wounded. Wise had two men killed and 12 wounded as Mediator had been more heavily engaged than Bacchante in the exchange of fire with the fort. Dacres estimated that French casualties had been high, but did not have a number as the Frenchmen took to the woods as the fort fell. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund, subsequently awarded both Dacres and Wise a sword each worth £100 that bore the inscriptions: * \\"From the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's to James Richard Dacres Esqr. Capt. of H.M.S. Bacchante for his Gallant Conduct in the Capture of the French National Schooner Dauphin and the Destruction of the Fort and Cannon in the Harbour of Samana on 16th February 1807 effected by the Bacchante in company with H.M.S. Mediator as Recorded in the London Gazette of the 25th of April\\".Lloyd's Patriotic Fund, - accessed 14 February 2014. * \\"From the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's to William Furlong Wise Esq. Capt. of H.M.S. Mediator for his Gallant Conduct in Storming and Destroying with the Seamen and Marines belonging to His Majesty's Ships Bacchante and Mediator the Fort and Cannon in the Harbour of Samana on 16th of February 1807 as Recorded in the London Gazette of the 25th of April\\". In May Mediator and Wise captured the Grouper on 3 May and the Dispatch on 6 May. In 1807 Captain George Reynolds replaced Wise, who had become ill and who remained in the West Indies for a little while to recuperate before returning home. By the end of the year Mediator had returned to Britain. In 1808 she was fitted as a storeship and command passed to Captain George Blamey. Her role became one of conveying supplies to the various squadrons blockading French ports. On 15 March 1808 Mediator recaptured the Swedish ship Maria Christiana. In May 1808 Captain John Pasco managed to obtain the command of Mediator for three months. In January 1809 Mediator was at Corunna. The battle of Corunna, which took place on 16 January 1809, had British troops holding off the French to cover the embarkation of the British Army after its retreat. In this battle Sir John Moore was killed. Mediator and a number of other warships and transports arrived on 14 and 15 January from Vigo. Mediator took on board a great number of sick and wounded soldiers, and then sailed to Lisbon. After the evacuation was complete a violent fever and ague inflicted Blamey so the Navy appointed Captain James Woolridge acting captain until Blamey recovered. Fate: A blaze of glory On 11 April 1809 Woolridge, in Mediator commanded the flotilla of fire and explosion ships that the Admirals Gambier and Lord Cochrane sent in to Basque Roads to attack the fleet that was arrayed there. A flotilla of six fireships, together with one ship laden with combustibles, had gathered at Portsmouth but had been unable to sail. Gambier decided not to wait. He took eight of the largest transports at his command and converted them to fireships. The necessary combustibles came from three French chasse-marées, laden with tar and rosin, that the fleet had recently captured. At Lord Cochrane's suggestion, Mediator too was fitted as a fire-ship. The fireships attacked at 8:30 p.m., but several had to be abandoned when their fuzes started prematurely. Mediator, with the benefit of the wind and a tide running at four knots broke through the boom protecting the French fleet. Woolridge and his skeleton crew barely escaped before she burst into flames. As it was, a gunner was killed, and Woolridge, Lieutenant Nicholas Brent Clements, Lieutenant James Pearl, and seaman Michael Gibson all received burns when they were blown out of her after she started to burn. When Blamey, who was in sick quarters, heard that Mediator was going to lead the attack, hurried to join her. However he did not arrive until 12 April. The battle continued the next day with the French losing four ships-of-the-line and a frigate. Ville de Varsovie (80), and Aquilon (74), were both burnt. (74), (54), and Indienne (46), were scuttled. King George presented Woolridge with a gold medal and chain, worth £100, that had been specially struck for the occasion. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund also presented Woolridge with a sword worth £100. Lastly, he was promoted to the rank of post captain. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the award of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Basque Roads 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the action.

Odom spent 15 years with the Missouri Tigers program as a player, recruiter, assistant coach, and head coach. Born in Lawton, Oklahoma, Odom and his wife Tia were married in July 2000. Tia is a native of Kahoka, Missouri, and is a graduate of MU's College of Human Environmental Sciences. The couple has three children. High school playing career Odom played high school football (linebacker and running back) at Maysville Junior/Senior High School, before transferring to Ada High School for his senior season. Intent on playing major college football at Maysville, Odom spent his senior year in Ada, where Odom helped the team to a second straight state title. Odom's first game for Ada High School came in 1994 against their rival, Ardmore. Odom guided the team to a 39-13 victory that night. Odom finished his senior season with 39 touchdowns. After he ran the 100 in 10.6 in the spring of his senior year, then-Mizzou coach Larry Smith offered a scholarship. College career Odom played college football at the University of Missouri as a linebacker from 1996 to 1999.New Mizzou DC Odom rides Memphis success back to alma mater He recorded 72 tackles as a freshman. In the spring of 1997, he tore his ACL but recovered in time to start all 12 games of his sophomore season. He ended his playing career with 362 tackles, which still ranks as seventh-most in school history. Odom was chosen as a team captain as a senior in 1999 and would go on to finish with 362 tackles — the seventh-most in Missouri Tigers history. Odom was a key figure on the Missouri teams which reached bowl games in 1997 and 1998. Odom earned his bachelor's degree from MU in 1999, and a master's degree in education from MU in 2004. Odom wore No. 39 to honor the year the university started, 1839. Coaching career Early career After earning his undergraduate degree in December 1999, he served as an intern with Mizzou's Tiger Scholarship Fund while he worked on his Master's in Education from the University of Missouri (which he would earn in May 2004). He returned to his home state of Oklahoma in July of that year to serve as an assistant football coach for his alma mater Ada High School, which finished that season as runners-up for a state title. Odom returned to his adopted hometown of Columbia, Mo., taking over as head coach at Rock Bridge High School. Odom helped the program turn around, which hadn't had a winning season since 1997. The Bruins went 6-4 in 2001, a two-win improvement from the previous season. The next year, Odom guided Rock Bridge to an 8-4 campaign and an appearance in the Class 6 semifinals. Six weeks after the season ended, Gary Pinkel hired Odom as a graduate assistant at Missouri, and Odom began a nine-year period of serving in various roles on Gary Pinkel's staff. Missouri In 2003, Odom returned to Missouri as an administrative graduate assistant. He stayed at Missouri until 2012, serving in numerous different coaching and administrative positions. 2003–2008 Wanting to run a college program, Odom joined the Mizzou staff, first as an administrative graduate assistant for Gary Pinkel in 2003. He spent the 2004 and 2005 seasons as Pinkel's director of recruiting as the staff assembled a core group which would help lead Mizzou to consecutive Big 12 Conference North Division titles in 2007 and 2008 which consisted of 12-win and 10-win seasons, respectively. From 2006-08, Odom helped run Pinkel's program administratively as his director of operations. In that role, Odom oversaw coordination of the team's budget, travel plans (including bowl trips to the Sun, Cotton and Alamo bowls during that stretch), compliance issues, facilities operations and scheduling, as well as assisting with recruiting operations and managing the day-to-day overall operations of the program. As director of football operations, he coordinated all public relations activities and community service events that required the presence of Mizzou's football student- athletes, and also played a role as part of the design and planning team that oversaw the expansion and renovation of the Mizzou Athletics Training Complex, which opened in February 2008. 2009–2011 In 2009, Odom took over as safeties coach under Pinkel. He helped the Tigers climb from 104th in the nation in pass yards allowed/game in 2009, to 37th in the nation in 2010. During his three seasons as safeties coach, the Missouri Tigers went 26-13, including a 2010 Big 12 North division title. The 2010 team defense finished 11th in the nation in defensive pass rating, 19th nationally with 18 interceptions, 12th nationally in touchdowns allowed, 10th nationally in yards/attempt. Defensive coordinator Memphis (2012–2014) In 2012, Odom left Missouri to become defensive coordinator of the Memphis Tigers under head coach Justin Fuente. In 2015, Odom again returned to Missouri, this time to serve as defensive coordinator.Missouri hires familiar face, Barry Odom, as new defensive coordinator Memphis ranked 117th nationally in total defense in 2011, the season before Odom joined staff. Three years later, Memphis ranked 28th. Odom became well known due to his performance during three years directing Memphis’ defense from 2012-14. His 2014 defense was a key component of Memphis’ 10-3 season, as his unit finished the regular season ranked fifth nationally in scoring defense (17.1 avg.) and 22nd in total defense (343.3 avg.). In his first season at Memphis, the defense improved to 50th nationally (383.6 avg.), followed by a jump to 39th in 2013 (370.7 avg.). Memphis earned a share of the 2014 American Athletic Conference title, giving them a conference championship for the first time since 1971. Missouri (2015) After the 2014 season, Missouri needed a new defensive coordinator after Dave Steckel left to become the head coach at Missouri State. Pinkel tabbed Odom as Steckel's replacement. Odom's Tigers ranked ninth in the nation in total defense, allowing just 302.0 yards per game. Since the NCAA began tracking defensive statistics in 1978, this marks the first time in MU history that Mizzou has had a top-10 defense. Odom's defense was also ranked seventh nationally in scoring defense (16.2 avg.), seventh in pass defense (169.2 avg.) and second in tackles for loss (8.8 avg.). Arkansas (2020–present) On December 16, 2019, Odom was hired by new Arkansas Razorbacks head coach Sam Pittman as defensive coordinator. Missouri head coach (2016–2019) Odom was named the head coach of the Missouri Tigers football team on December 3, 2015, after former head coach Gary Pinkel retired after 15 seasons due to health-related issues. At 38, Coach Odom was the second youngest head coach for the Missouri Tigers. As of 2019, Odom is paid $3.05 million a year which ranks 11th among 14 head coaches in the SEC Conference.Matter, D.

The Tigers closed the season out with wins in two of their final three games – with both coming against bowl teams in Arkansas and Vanderbilt. 2017 In 2017, Odom helped the Tigers achieve a seven-win season, earning the program its first bowl game since 2014. Mizzou closed the regular season with a six-game win streak that culminated in a road win at Arkansas. The win moved Mizzou to 7-5 marking an in-season turnaround that saw MU rebound from a 1–5 start on the year. Odom's team earned an invitation to the 2017 Academy Sports + Outdoor Texas Bowl for its effort; however, the end result of the bowl game didn't go Mizzou's way. Coming off a 4–8 season in 2016, Mizzou was picked to finish last in the seven-team Southeastern Conference Eastern Division by pre- season experts, but the Tigers proved the prediction wrong, as they ended tied for third at 4–4 in league play – becoming the first SEC team to start 0–4 in conference play and finish 4–4. Odom became the first Mizzou coach to make a bowl game in his second year at MU since Warren Powers did so in each of his first two seasons in 1978 and 1979. 2018 In 2018, Odom's Tigers finished a regular-season ranked No. 23 in the College Football Playoff poll (No. 24 in the Associated Press poll) with eight wins, reached a second- straight bowl game, and achieved another road win. His 8–4 record during the 2018 season, marked just the 17th time in Mizzou's 128-year history that the Tigers have recorded an eight-win regular season. Heading into 2019, several national outlets have the Tigers ranked in their pre-season top-25 polls – with one slotting MU as high as number 13. Odom and his staff worked to assemble a 2019 signing class that ranked 31st (Rivals.com), a standing that's among the highest-ranked classes ever assembled at Mizzou. Odom also convinced transfer quarterback Kelly Bryant to become a Tiger. The former Clemson starter, who led them to the College Football Playoff in 2017 and had a starting record of 16–2, will be in the program for 2019. On the field, Odom guided his troops to an 8–5 record in 2018 and to the school's third all-time appearance in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl. After increasing his win total each year since taking over in 2016, Odom's three-year career stands at 19–19. He is only the fourth coach in Mizzou history to reach bowl games in two of his first three seasons at MU, joining College Football Hall of Fame Coach Dan Devine in that category, as well as former coaches Al Onofrio and Powers. In the classroom, Odom's program achieved at a record level in 2018. The team turned in a grade point average of 2.90 this past fall, which exceeded the previous program record of 2.69 set in the fall of 2015. Additionally, 58 team members – more than half of the 115-man roster – earned a fall GPA of at least 3.0, which is almost double the total of 30 Tigers from fall 2017 who recorded a 3.0 or better. For the second-straight season, Odom's team finished the regular season in a 4-0 win streak in the month of November, including a 38–17 win at No. 11 Florida on Nov. 3 that marked Mizzou's largest road win over a ranked opponent since 2008. Odom's teams have now won nine-straight games in the month of November, and are 10–2 overall. His 19 wins are the most through three seasons by a Tiger coach since Powers won 23 from 1978-80. 2019 After starting 2019 with an unexpected loss to Wyoming, Missouri won their next five games. They then lost their next five, including losses to Kentucky, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt. Odom's team won the final 2019 regular season game against 2–9 Arkansas. Odom was fired the next morning.

Rosenthal and written by Brooks McLaren. The film stars Theo James, Forest Whitaker, Grace Dove, Nicole Ari Parker, Kat Graham, and Mark O'Brien. The film was released on July 13, 2018, by Netflix.  Plot  Will and Samantha (Sam) are a young couple who are expecting their first child. Will flies from Seattle to visit Sam's parents in Chicago, intending to ask Tom, Sam's disapproving father, for permission to marry Sam. At dinner, Will and Tom get into an argument, and Will leaves without mentioning the pregnancy or wedding plans. The next day, Sam calls Will before his flight back. There is a mysterious sound, and Samantha, scared, says, \\"Something's wrong\\" before the call disconnects and Will cannot call her back. At the airport, all flights are cancelled. During a TV news report that discusses preliminary reports on a seismic event off the West Coast of the United States that has disrupted electrical power and telecommunication, electricity and phone lines in Chicago are disrupted. Will returns to Sam's parents' house, where Tom and Will agree to drive together to Seattle to find Sam. Amidst heavy traffic, Will and Tom discover that soldiers have closed off the interstate highway for safety reasons. Invoking his prior service as a Marine, Tom manages to persuade them to let his car through. That night, they are pulled over by what appears to be a police patrol but is in actuality an escaped convict with a shotgun. The ensuing firefight results in an accident that fractures Tom's ribs. Tom knocks out the convict, and they use the police cruiser to tow their damaged car to a nearby reservation. At the reservation, Tom finds a mechanic, Ricki, who fixes the car and agrees to travel with them in case their car breaks down again. The trio set out, making sure to restock for provisions when they can, first at a small town reluctant to help outsiders and again at an abandoned theme park. At one point, robbers hold the three of them at gunpoint and steal their gasoline reserves. Realizing that without fuel they are doomed, Will chases and finally catches up with the fleeing car. Ricki shoots out the other car's tires, causing the thieves' vehicle to flip over. With the surrounding fire and the flipped car's leaking gas tank, they barely have enough time to take their gasoline back before the car explodes, resulting in the robbers' deaths. Later that night, upset over the consequences of her actions, Ricki leaves Tom and Will. The next day Tom's lung collapses, preventing him from breathing. Will performs a needle thoracostomy to help him. Sensing that Tom will die without medical help, the two of them bond, and Will finally feels that Tom approves of his relationship with Sam. On a bridge, they encounter a gang of armed men on motorcycles. The two of them work together to evade the gang, but Tom succumbs to his wounds and dies. The car breaks down, and Will continues the journey on foot. A family picks Will up, and he leads them to his estranged father's empty house in Idaho where they all rest. Will strikes a deal with the family for him to take their four wheel drive vehicle in exchange for them staying at his father's well-stocked house until they are ready to go north, where they hear the situation is better. As he gets closer to Seattle, Will sees that the city is almost completely destroyed. Finally reaching Sam's devastated apartment, Will sees a note left by Sam with an address to a cabin. At the cabin, Will finds Sam with Jeremiah, a neighbor from the apartment building. Convinced that the disaster is not natural but the result of an elaborate attack, Jeremiah reveals a deep paranoia. The next morning, Jeremiah attempts to kill Will, having fallen in love with Sam. Will shoots him as he turns to fire his pistol. Soon after, an earthquake triggers a large eruption, causing a pyroclastic flow. Will and Sam speed away from the all-engulfing cloud, barely staying ahead of it but managing to out-distance it as it subsides. The couple proclaim their love for one another, regardless of what happens next, as they, too, head north.

She filled up the blank of spectroscopy research in China, and became the first person to measure the whole internal friction peak of metallic glass. He Yizhen was one of the founders of the Institute of Solid State Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Hefei. The research emphases of the institute are nuclear engineering, special metallic materials, and internal friction of solid.  Early life  He Yizhen was born to a scholarly family as the eldest child in 1910, soon before Qing dynasty, the last dynasty of China, was overthrown. Her father, He Cheng, participated in the Xinhai Revolution which subverted the Qing Dynasty. Because He Cheng contributed to political reform, his family became powerful in the new period of history. The new government, Republic of China, was established in 1912. When He was born, it was still a common practice for women to bind their feet. Her grandmother, Wang Xiechangda, was an open-minded educator and social activist for women’s rights, who became a prominent influence in He Yizhen's life. Wang believed that women should go to school and argued against bound feet, established Zhehua Women’s School. Yizhen, along with her seven brothers and sisters, graduated from Zhenhua School. She had seven siblings: He Zeming, He Zehui, He Zerong, He Zeying, He Zeyuan, He Zecheng, and He Zeqing. All the eight brothers and sisters became scientists in their own right. Yizhen, Zehui, and Zeying are known as the \\"Three He sisters\\" in Chinese scientific circle.  Education  He graduated at Zhenhua Girls School in 1926 and subsequently attended Ginling College, where she studied Mathematics and Physics. Following her graduation from Ginling College in 1930, He taught at a missionary school for one year. Her father provided He with a sum of money for either dowry or abroad tuition, with the implicit understanding that he was encouraging her to continue her education. He's two aunts who resided in the United States helped her obtain scholarships from Mount Holyoke College (MHC) and Wellesley College in 1931, where she chose to continue her postgraduate education. She obtained a Master’s degree in Chemistry and physics from MHC in 1933. Though He had intended to return to China after her graduation, her mentor recommended her to pursue higher degree. She pursued a doctorate in physics degree from University of Michigan Ann Arbor in 1937 and was awarded Barbour scholarship, which was especially built for Asian women. In her Ph.D. research, He focused on spectroscopy of transition metals. At the time she was pursuing her postgraduate studies, Chinese women attending college were rare, particularly women studying science. In China, He's cousin Wang Mingzhen had initially obtained funds from Tsinghua University to study abroad, but ultimately had been refused because the dean of the university refused to provide funding for a woman to study. He, Wang, and He's sister Zehui would later obtain doctoral degrees in physics from the United States and Germany, despite attempts to dissuade them from continuing to studying physics.  Career  He returned to China in 1937, at the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Her family moved from Suzhou to Beijing. Because of her father’s close friendship with the principal of Yenching University, He obtained a position there as a lecturer. In 1939, He left Beijing and took a position as lecturer in Donghao University in Shanghai. After her marriage to Ge Tingsui in 1941, He returned to the United States with her husband. Through her previous academic connections, she was recommended for a position at a college and eventually became a research assistant to Dr. Ralph A. Beebe at Amherst College. Her research topic was the measurement of thermal adoption in chemistry, rather than spectroscopy. Because she was pregnant, she only stayed in the position for several months and focused on raising her children, who were born in 1942 and 1947. She also worked for briefly at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Metal Research Institute of the University of Chicago. He returned to China in 1949, after founding of the People's Republic of China, and became a professor at Yenching University. From 1952, He began working at the Institute of Metal Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Her research focused on improving the production rate of China's nascent steel industry through the application of spectroscopy to alloy steel and slag analysis in steel industry and solved issues in steel production. She published two representative papers: “Effect of Microstructure of Steel on Spectral Analysis” and “Cup Electrode Solution Arc Method for Spectral Analysis of Open Hearth Slag”. On behalf of China, she attended the 6th International Conference of Raman Spectroscopy in 1956, in Holland. From 1966 to 1976, He's research was interrupted by effects of China's Cultural Revolution. She was forced to endure humiliating punishments as a result of her experience studying abroad and her wealthy background. In 1969, she was dispatched to rural area Panjin to labor for two months as punishment. When the Cultural Revolution of China ended in 1976, He continued her theoretical research. She became a pioneer in exploring amorphous state physic and metallic glass fields and measured crystallization internal fraction peak of metallic glass and found a new type of internal fraction peak. Subsequently, she published two formative papers: “Effect of the Isothermal Effectiveness Near the Peak of the Metallic Glass Pd80Si20Tg”, and “A New Peak Near Metallic Glass T”. Her papers won the Second Class Prizes of The State Scientific and Technological Progress Award of Chinese Academy of Science in 1988. She would go on to win the Third Class Prizes of The Natural Science Award of Chinese Academy of Science in 1995 and 1996 and was involved in compiling the book, Amorphous Physics. In October 1982, she became one of the founders of Institute of Solid State Physics, Chinese Academy of Science. She was one of five scientists who could be called “sir” (an outdated honorific form for intellectuals regardless of gender). He continued her research about metallic glass at the new institute.  Personal life  In 1941, He Yizhen married Ge Tingsui, an expert in nuclear physics. Ge later became a leading researcher at the Institute of Metal Research and Institute of Solid State Physics. They developed a competitive relationship with one another due to their studies in the same field. The couple met at Yenching University, where He had been a lecturer and was three years older than Ge. Because He came from a wealthy and influential family, she had a number of admirers; her family did not approve of her relationship with Ge became he came from a poor family and also suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, for which a valid treatment was not available at the time. Furthermore, Ge's political beliefs clashed with He's father, who disagreed with Ge's support of the political activism of students. In opposition to her family's wishes, she married Ge; their marriage became a much-told tale in Chinese academic world and their love letters are still preserved in their biographies.“The frogs’ quack in the river inspires my infinite feelings; a round hedgehog climbing over my foot makes me fall into deep meditation...... I have no chance to press that rustle of the bell anymore! Among the sound of the opening door, I can never see the smile that I love again!” After their marriage, Ge obtained the opportunity to study in the United States with He, where they remained from 1941 to 1949. Their two children were born in the United States and eventually became scientists: their daughter Ge Yunpei (1942-2013) was a professor in Shenyang Jianzhu University, while their son Ge Yunjian (born 1947), is an expert in robotics. The couple returned to China in 1949, where they both worked for the Chinese Academy of Science for decades. When Ge was dispatched to work in Hefei in 1980, He's husband and children persuaded her to stop her research to join him in Hefei.

The group gained recognition as outsiders, taking a musical route that separated them from the trends set in the region by the Sonics and the Fabulous Wailers. Though largely overlooked on a national level, the United Travel Service has become revered for two psychedelia-tinged singles. History College student John Reeves (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), while studying at Oregon State University, formed the United Travel Service in late-1966 with the intention of bringing the San Francisco Sound to the Northwest. In order to accomplish this task, Reeves first sent advertisement flyers in search of band members, and recruited Dale Sweetland (drums, vocals) who eagerly signed on to the project after Reeves played the Grateful Dead's song, \\"Viola Lee Blues\\", to exemplify the future group's sound. Musicians Benjamin Hoff (bass guitar, vocals), and Jim Richards (lead guitar) joined soon thereafter. Prior to being known as the United Travel Service, the band played at one gig as the Virgin Forest; however, the performance was without Hoff and Richards. The band first gained notoriety by performing around Portland, with a repertoire that included cover versions of the group's inspirations, San Francisco bands Jefferson Airplane and Quicksilver Messenger Service, the latter of which inspired the United Travel Service's moniker. However, over time, the group was more recognized for Hoff's unique folk- psychedelic rock originals. After establishing themselves on the local live circuit, the band signed with record producer Rick Keefer and sound engineer Ken Bass. They entered Keefer and Bass's home studio, and recorded the compositions \\"Wind and Fire\\"—with instrumentals marked by a raga-like guitar solo—and \\"Drummer of Your Mind\\", which is inspired by poet Henry David Thoreau's quote: “If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer”. The songs were coupled together on the United Travel Service's debut single, which was distributed on Laurie Records' subsidiary record labels Rust and Ridon Records. It became immensely popular regionally, charting at number three on Portland's KFLY radio station charts. In 1968, the group released their second and final single, \\"Gypsy Eyes\\" (an original song with no relation to Jimi Hendrix's composition of the same name). It appeared the United Travel Service was nearing a national breakthrough as they commenced a tour with their idol band, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and were in preparation for a gig at the Fillmore West. However, the group mutually decided with Laurie Records—who were no longer going to seriously advertise the band—to void their recording contract, which left the two songs, \\"Snow\\" and \\"Slightest Possibility\\", unreleased. In addition, Reeves departed the United Travel Service in July 1969 to join the U.S. Air Force, leaving the band short-handed and consequently causing their disbandment later in the year. After the group broke up, Hoff went on to be a successful author, writing such works like The Tao of Pooh. Over the years, the United Travel Service's material has appeared on numerous compilation albums, including Echoes in Time, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 16, Sixties Archives, Volume 5, and Psychedelic Moods, Part Two. In 2009, Break-A-Way Records released Wind and Stone, an album that features.the group's complete discography, both released and previously unissued.

The powered sail then pulls the sailor out of the water enough so they could step up and onto the board. When the sail is first being lifted, it often helps to push the back of the board slightly underwater, and setting the front of the boom onto the board (near the footstraps). The buoyancy of the board will then push the boom upward, helping to lift the sail out of the water. Waterstarting is faster and less tiring compared to climbing back on the board and uphauling the sail, but requires enough wind (about 14 knots or more, depending on the skills, weight and agility of the surfer) to perform. Waterstarting requires flying the sail and getting the mast high enough so that the wind will finish in lifting the sailor's weight up and onto the board. Mastering this technique is imperative when sailing in high winds or in large swell, when uphauling the sail would be difficult or impossible. It is also necessary when sailing on smaller boards, when the board does not have enough buoyancy for the sailor to stand on it with enough stability to uphaul the sail. Many sailors practice waterstarting in shallow waters, where it is easier to maneuver the board and rig into the correct position. When a beginner sails in windier conditions and falls in deeper water, there will be more opportunity to learn a \\"deep water\\" waterstart. Variations  Clew- first waterstart  Waterstarting clew-first, note that the mast hand is closer to the tail of the board A clew-first waterstart is a variation used to start in the opposite direction from the one the board is initially pointing. It is very similar to a standard waterstart. The main difference is that once the sail is flying, the board is on the mast side of the sailor and points a bit further downwind, on a broad reach. The sail is flipped once the sailor is up and on the board.  Light wind waterstart  Waterstarting in light wind is also possible, but more difficult to perform, and may even require a different technique such as controlling the rig by the foot of the sail and lower part of the mast (i.e. controlling the sail at a point lower than the boom). As such, it is considered an expert-level skill. Experts can waterstart in winds as light as 7-10kt.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wells from 1765 until his death.  Career  He was the second surviving son of Samuel Child MP, and younger brother of Francis Child. In 1763, he succeeded his brother as nominal head of the family's bank, Child & Co., bringing him an annual income of over £30,000 (£ in ). He also inherited the estate of Osterley Park in Middlesex, where he continued his brother's project of remodelling the house to the designs of Robert Adam. Child contested Aylesbury at a by-election in 1764, but withdrew due to ill- health. The following year he contested Wells, and after a bitterly fought campaign, two polls were held; one returned Child, the other his rival Peter Taylor, a local grocer's son who grown rich as an army commissary in Germany during the Seven Years' War. In early 1766 Child was awarded the seat on petition. He appears never to have spoken in the House of Commons, and voted largely with the opposition despite his bank's significant business with the government.  Personal life and family  Child's runaway daughter Sarah Anne, as painted in miniature in 1786 In October 1763, Child married Sarah Jodrell, daughter of Gilbert Jodrell of Ankerwyke, Buckinghamshire. They had only one child, a daughter Sarah Anne (born 1764), who in May 1782 eloped to Gretna Green to marry the 10th Earl of Westmorland. Her father abhorred the Earl, and pursued the couple until one of his horses was shot by Westmorland's men. Her father had approved the marriage before his death in July that year, but disinherited her to prevent his fortune falling into Westmorland's hands. Instead, his wife Sarah inherited a life interest in the bank, where she remained a senior partner until her death in 1793. She remarried in 1791, to Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, but excluded him from the running of the bank. After her death, her husband's will settled his estate on the second surviving son or eldest daughter of Sarah Anne. However, only one of Child's grandsons survived, so the estate -- including Osterley Park and the senior partnership in the bank -- passed to Sarah Sophia Fane, his eldest granddaughter. She married George Child Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey, but like her grandmother she ran the bank without admitting her husband to the partnership. Her wealth was so great that on her marriage in 1805 she gave £20,000 (£ in ) each to her father, her brother and two sisters, but still had an annual income from her inheritance of over £60,000 (£ in ).

García Cabral was also an expert tango dancer, Greco-Romano wrestler, and pioneer of silent film. He was extremely social and knew famous personalities of his period including Enrico Caruso, Walt Disney, Charles Lindbergh, Dolores del Río and Mario Moreno (\\"Cantinflas\\").  Biography  Born in Huatusco, Veracruz, García Cabral's first known work appeared in a newspaper in 1900. Because of his talent, he taught drawing at his school from the age of 12 years. In December 1906 Huatusco mayor Joaquín Castro, wrote the governor of Veracruz, Teodoro A. Dehesa, seeking a scholarship for García Cabral, which once granted allowed him to enter the Academy of San Carlos, where he studied with Germán Gedovius, at the time an collaborator, and there García Cabral discovered classicism, as well as through the foreign currents that arrived in imported magazines. He began his professional career in 1909, as illustrator and caricaturist at The Tarantula, run at the time by Fortunato Herrerías, who later became one of his best friends. During the suppression of the lifting of Aquiles Serdán eyewitness to the facts, that later described telegráficamente to García Cabral so that it illustrated the report. These illustrations (10 in total) are the first known images of the Mexican Revolution. In spite of this, when the revolution broke out, the publications of Herrerías and the works of García Cabral adopted a strong anti-maderista tone. Later García Cabral worked in 1911 at Mario Vitoria's Multicolor magazine, also anti-maderista. During the revolution, García Cabral drew caricatures of people like Francisco I. Madero, Enrique Creel, Pancho Villa, Bernardo Reyes, María Conesa and Emiliano Zapata. In February 1912 Madero awarded García Cabral a scholarship to study in Paris. In addition to his studies, García Cabral worked in France for the publications La Baïonnette, Le Rire and La Vie Parisienne, forced to do so by need when president Victoriano Huerta withdrew his scholarship. Gradually developing his personal and dramatic style, in 1915 García Cabral left France in the middle of the deprivation caused by the wartime economy, making his way to Madrid, and from there to Buenos Aires, Argentina. He drew there for newspapers La Nación, El Mundial and El Tiempo; likewise he also worked for Caras y Caretas, I.G.B., Proteo and La Pluma, as well as the Chilean publications Revista Popular and Los Diez de Chile.

However it is his work as illustrator of covers for the publication of Magazine of Magazines the one who awarded him deserved fame, giving to know his innovative and fluent style that helped to enter the Art Deco to the American continent.

The Partnership serves as an advisory council to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on local, state, and federal child abuse prevention fund allocations as designated under the California Welfare and Institutions Code. It functions as a major collaborating, coordinating, networking, educational, outreach, and communication resource providing a safety net and helping children, individuals, and families at all stages of the lifespan. Their stated mission is, \\"To promote a community committed to safe healthy families.\\"  History  The Partnership originated in 1982, when the Child Abuse Prevention and Intervention and Treatment (CAPIT) program was established by Chapter 1398, Statutes of 1982, and AB 1733 of the State of California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 18960 et seq., and the Ventura County Board of Supervisors acknowledged the Ventura County Council on Child Abuse. The Partnership was created out of a 2002 merger of the Ventura County Child Abuse Prevention Council and Ventura County Family Violence Prevention. In 2003, The Partnership developed an alliance with the then-Ventura County Elder Abuse Council, now the Ventura County Adult Abuse Prevention Council, in the effort to prevent abuse across the lifespan. In May 2008, the name of the organization was changed to The Partnership for Safe Families & Communities of Ventura County, The Designated Child Abuse Prevention Coalition (The Partnership), to streamline efforts to become a 501(c)(3) in order to better serve Ventura County. In March 2011, The Partnership was granted federal 501(c)(3) tax exempt status through the IRS. In July 2013, The Partnership became an independent non-profit.  Values  The Partnership is committed to protecting children, its communities, strengthening families, and giving hope to those seeking to break the sometimes generational bonds of physical, verbal, sexual, emotional abuse, family violence and community violence. Through education and prevention awareness they believe that communities can strengthen families to provide a safe and nurturing environment. By ensuring optimal development, they believe children can heal from the wounds of abuse and neglect, and families can improve their quality of life. They value and believe in the resilience of families, accountability, prevention of child abuse, countering family and community violence, and empowerment of the communities.  Events  The Partnership is involved in numerous events throughout the year. In April they observe Child Abuse Prevention Month. They also host an annual sock drive for the homeless. In past years the Partnership has held the CommUnity Summit for Violence Prevention as a means to network, educate, and spread awareness for their causes.

Groom retired in January 1978, selling the newspaper. In 2015, the newspaper continues to be published bi-weekly as the Innisfail Advocate by Newscorp.

This law change was made so that British citizens living in Sweden after Brexit would be able to apply for the status, because otherwise they would have been ineligible given they have lived in Sweden under right of residence, not with residence permits. The person applying must also have a means of supporting themselves. However, time on visitor's residence permit or residence permit for studies, among others, cannot be counted towards this time. Long-term EU residents moving to Sweden are required to apply for a residence permit if they stay for more than 90 days. They are however permitted to begin work or studies upon arrival, without waiting for a decision in such case. A work permit () is not required for a long-term EU resident, however a hiring certificate must be submitted for such residents applying on the grounds of employment. Reception Following the deadline for the introduction of a specific immigration status as a long-term resident of the European Union in 2006, the Directive was found to affect a relatively small percentage of the third-country nationals in most participating countries. Additionally, of these, few used their mobility rights within the EU. Main reasons cited for lack of adoption are the following: * the lack of information available about the LTR status among third-country nationals * the lack of information available about the LTR status among national migration administrations * the \\"competition\\" with national schemes: ** national long-term residence permits, and ** possibility to obtain EU citizenship in 5 years or shorter time in some countries * the \\"competition\\" with the Blue Card (European Union) * integration requirements Main reasons cited for lack of intra-EU mobility for third-country nationals with LTR are the following: * labour market restrictions and labour market tests in States different than those in which they originally resided * administrative barriers * recognition of degrees and diplomas * integration requirements * long-term resident permits issued in one EU country are exchanged to non-long-term resident permits in a new country * impossibility of cross-border work * other forms of discrimination Additional information According to the chapter IV, Article 24 of the Directive, periodically the Commission reports to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of this Directive in the Member States and proposes amendments as may be necessary. Reports provide information on specifics of application of the Directive in national legislation systems, as well as statistics of adoption of this type of residence permit. There were 2,861,306 long-term residents by the end of 2018, with 69.8% of them with permit issued by Italy.  Brexit and UK nationals with long-term EU residence  Long-term EU residence is what is recommended by Commission to be granted to UK nationals after Brexit, who lived in EU countries for more than 5 years. The rights obtained by UK nationals after converting to third-country nationals with LTR status would be significantly reduced in comparison to the set of rights exercised by them previously while being EU citizens.

Plot In 1845, trader Oliver Hale and his new wife are returning from New York to California. In a New Orleans music hall they meet and befriend an entertainer who uses the stage name of Florinda Grove. The dance hall singer is actually on the run from the New York police since she's wanted for a murder she claims to be innocent of. The Hales believe her story and help her escape the city under the guise of a widow bound for St. Louis on a riverboat. The newlyweds themselves reach New Mexico where they plan to join a wagon train bound for California. In Santa Fe, the Hales bump into entertainer Florinda again. While Oliver Hale is away on a short business trip, a messenger from his brother Charles Hale arrives in town, bringing a special letter from Charles. In the letter, Charles explains that Carmelita Velasco, the daughter of a wealthy landowner, claims to be pregnant with Oliver's child and that she and her family expect Oliver to do the right honorable thing and marry her. But, alas, the letter reaches Oliver too late since he's now already married to New Yorker Garnet. By refusing to marry Carmelita, Oliver risks offending the whole Velasco family. To make matters worse, the dowry of Carmelita Velasco consists of a large Spanish land tract that Charles Hale covets. Days later, Oliver Hale, his wife Garnet and their new friend Florinda join a wagon train destined for Los Angeles. How will Oliver get out of this tight spot and conciliate his family with the Velasco family while preserving their honor?

In that capacity, Khalilov organised many festive theatrical events in Moscow which were attended by Russian military bands and groups from many countries. Events included international military tattoos \\"The Kremlin Zorya\\", and \\"Spasskaya Tower\\". He toured with the leading bands of the Russian Armed Forces in Austria, Sweden, United States, Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Finland, France, Switzerland, and Belgium. Later life and death In April 2016, Khalilov became the artistic director of the Alexandrov Ensemble, known worldwide as the Red Army Choir. Khalilov retired from the Moscow Garrison Orchestra on 22 August 2016, and conducted Russian civil war song White Army, Black Baron on the Red Square as his last major performance with the massed bands. He was replaced by Colonel Timofey Mayakin, a Merited Artist of Russia, in his role as Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service. Khalilov toured the Hugh Hodgson School of Music of the University of Georgia in November 2016, where he gave musical instruction to the students, performed with the UGA Symphony Orchestra and Hodgson Wind Ensemble. He also attended a Georgia-Auburn football game with directory George Foreman, where he, according to Foreman, started composing a new march called \\"The Redcoat March\\", in honor of the Georgia Redcoat Marching Band.https://www.11alive.com/mobile/article/news/local/russian-conductor- killed-in-crash-had-uga-connection/85-379318046https://news.uga.edu/khalilov- visit-16/ Khalilov died in the crash of the RA-85572 Tupolev TU-154 plane that went down in the Black Sea off Sochi on 25 December 2016 with the choir and dance arm of the ensemble, scheduled to perform for Russian troops stationed in Syria as part of New Year celebrations. The crash was believed to have been caused by a problem with the plane's flaps though recently reports suggest pilot disorientation was the cause. At a makeshift memorial set up for him, hundreds of mourners left flowers and candles. Khalilov was buried on 16 January 2017 at the Tracts the Archangelsk churchyard of the Kirzhachskiy district, Vladimir region. He was given a military funeral that was attended by many of his past and former colleagues and students, and eulogies were given by many including his successor as senior director of music, Colonel Mayakin. The Nowinki Village in that district, which is located near the Khmelevo and the Archangel churchyard, is the birthplace of the ancestors of Khalilov. This village was his childhood home and Khalilov carried his love for Nowinki and its picturesque surroundings throughout his life and as such, he was buried here instead of in Moscow. He last spent time in this village on 11 December 2016, two weeks before his death. Prior to his death, Khalilov was still actively writing music for various occasions including a piece for a Russian film. Legacy Khalilov was an accomplished musician and conductor, able to play many types of musical instruments, including the piano, with proficiency, and to conduct both choirs and bands. He conducted the thousand- strong massed military bands during Victory Day parades including the band's closing performance for the parade. Notably, he conducted the massed bands during the 60th, 65th and 70th Victory Day parades. These performances were of greater length than normal and the endings were somewhat unusual. Khalilov was the last of the great conductors educated in Soviet times. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the band, along with the rest of the army, was in disarray. When he was appointed conductor of the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, he worked hard to reorganize and rebuild it, to the point that it had a more prominent feature than before in the Victory Day parades. In 2003 the band fielded less than 400 musicians for the Victory Day parade but by the 2016 Victory Day parade, the massed bands had more than a thousand musicians led by more than 20 deputy directors, with 12 drum majors and 2 senior drum majors (for a total of 16, plus another 12 at the rear). In the 2010 Victory Day parade, Khalilov successfully conducted a huge combined band consisting of both Russian and foreign military bands. During the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo, Khalilov would sometimes conduct all the participants as they played the final song during the closing ceremony. Khalilov described the effect these bands have in the following 2005 interview with the Los Angeles Times:https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-2005-may-09-fg-bands9-story.html?_amp=true Khalilov was also an accomplished music composer apart from being a military conductor, and wrote many pieces for the brass band including \\"Adagio\\", \\"Kant\\", \\"Afghan\\", \\"Elegy\\", marches such as \\"Cadet\\", \\"Youth\\", \\"Rynda\\", \\"Ulan\\", as well as romances and songs. He composed many new military marches and songs, some of which he used in the Victory Day parades he conducted. It was announced on the third anniversary of his death in 2019 that a military tattoo titled the Valery Khalilov International Music Festival would take place between 29 January and 2 February 2020, specifically timed to honour Khalilov's birthday on 30 January.https://spasstower.ru/en/news/v-pamyat-o-maestro-mezhdunarodnyy- muzykalnyy-festival-valeriya-khalilova/ Awards In his career, he earned many awards including the Order of Honor, Order \\"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" 3rd Class, the Medal for Military Merit 1st Class, and the titles of Honoured People's Artist of Russia and Honoured Art Worker of Russia. In his lifetime, he had conducted many interviews and appeared in programmes about Russian military bands, making him relatively popular and well known among the public for a military conductor. The Moscow Military Music College was renamed the Moscow Military Music College Lieutenant-General VM Khalilov. Valery Khalilov Square in Kirzhach is named after him in his memory and according to a Russian news commentary, the square \\"is a lovely park - the same age as the deceased conductor\\". Social activists of the city have also decided to establish a festival of brass bands in memory of Khalilov, which is to be held in the newly opened Alexander Garden. The first festival is planned for July 2017 and the park has been described as \\"a beautiful place and a suitable place.\\" One of the streets in the city was renamed after him and officials renamed the various places and institutions by 30 January, Khalilov's birthday.

The ZNIR was officially formed and registered with the government on May 5, 1954 by Iaido practitioners from multiple styles. The ZNIR is Japan's oldest and largest Iaidō-only specialist organization. It holds yearly National Kyoto Iaidō Event in Kyoto, Japan typically from May 3 to May 5 and Hamamatsu National Iaidō Competition Tournament in Hamamatsu city in October. ZNIR also holds many other regional Iaidō tournaments regularly throughout the years. History The All Japan Iaido Federation was founded in 1948, and recognized officially as an organization with the Japanese Government in 1954. In 1956, the ZNIR established 全日本居合道連盟刀法 (Zen Nippon Iaidō Renmei Tōhō) in an effort to unify practitioners and create a common set to fairly grade each practitioner from varying styles.

The album also reached number 73 on the Australian iTunes chart on 21 October 2015. Their first album, Moments from Ephemeral City (2011), and a follow up EP, Colossus (2011), were released independently before signing with Welkin Records and releasing their second album, The Tide, the Thief & River's End (2013). The band then signed with Inside Out Music for the release of their third album, Bloom (2015), and their fourth album In Contact (2017). The band released their fifth album, Rise Radiant, on 22 May 2020.  History   Formation and Moments from Ephemeral City / Colossus (2011)  In early 2011 Caligula's Horse was formed by Sam Vallen and Jim Grey. The band is named after the prized possession, Incitatus, of Roman Emperor Caligula by Grey, who is studying ancient history and classical languages at university. Initially Caligula's Horse consisted of only Grey on vocals and Vallen playing multiple instruments. Their debut album Moments from Ephemeral City was independently released on 2 April 2011. Vallen is credited with the songwriting, guitars, production, audio engineering, mixing and mastering. The band initially could not decide whether to continue or not, but after the online response for their album they decided they should expand their lineup for live shows. The lineup expanded to include Zac Greensill, Geoff Irish and Dave Couper. To showcase their new lineup a two- track EP Colossus was released in September 2011.  The Tide, the Thief & River's End (2013)  In mid 2012 the band entered the studio to commence their follow up LP. Their album The Tide, the Thief & River's End was released 13 October 2013 through Welkin Records. This was a concept album with each track listed in a chronological order to tell a story that refers to the uprising of rebels, called \\"The Tide\\", within the city of \\"River's End\\", and a journey of oppressed people finding a safe haven that has unfortunate similarities between the old and new city. \\"The Thief\\" is the only character who remains in the story from start to finish. The band undertook an intense touring schedule within Australia after the release of the album, and became known for their energetic live show and stage presence. The band was part of Progfest Sydney 2013 and Progfest Melbourne 2014. They toured with bands Opeth, Mastodon, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Protest the Hero, The Ocean, Firewind, Twelve Foot Ninja, and Ne Obliviscaris.  Bloom (2015)  After their second album they gained the interest of the recording label, InsideOut Music, and signed on to release their third album through them. Prior to the release of the album the band toured around Australia with TesseracT and played a mix of crowd favourites and unreleased songs off Bloom. Bloom was released 16 October 2015 and in its debut week on the ARIA charts it reached number 16 on the Australian band's chart and 75 on the overall chart. It peaked at 73 on the iTunes Australian charts in its first week. The album cover was designed by Chris Stevenson-Mangos who was given the aim of creating \\"something colourful and vibrant, somewhat circular in design (no hard edges) but perhaps suggesting stained-glass, and showing lots of nature imagery\\". An official music video was released for \\"Firelight\\" off the Bloom album. Caligula's Horse began their first European tour with Shining in October and November 2015. Sam Vallen and Zac Greensill were nominated on Total Guitar reader's poll for the best prog rock guitarist of 2015. On 30 May 2016, it was announced that Geoff Irish had left the band.

On 15 September 2017, the band published In Contact, the first featuring Adrian Goleby and Josh Griffin, respectively their new guitarist and drummer, and the last to feature bassist Dave Couper, who quit the band the next year. In Contact received a highly positive acclaim, particularly in the progressive rock/metal community.

As a Miss Earth delegate, an advocacy is a must. When she was asked about her advocacy as Miss Earth, she answered via Miss Earth official website, \\"My main project is about building fountains together with greenfinity in Bahia Brasil. Water should be a human right and this is something I wanna fight for! Thirst is a constant issue for residents of the Bahia region in North Eastern Brazil. Permanent drought prevails in this area and climate change has caused the situation to deteriorate dramatically in recent years. Rain fails to arrive in the rainy season and the population has no water for their fields and their cattle, not for day-to-day hygiene or to drink. Disease and infection are the result, making the lives of the people much more difficult. It is mainly great soy producers who buy up land in large parts of Brazil. This is why poor farmers frequently lose their land. Many of them were forced to move to the dry and barren Bahia area in northeast Brazil. It would be impossible for the residents – who provide for themselves by growing vegetables and fishing – to access water without help, meaning that eventually they would have to migrate and settle in the larger cities. The Styrian \\"Verein für Quellen & Hilfsprojekte\\" (association for springs and aid projects) found out that there is enough ground water in this area to secure survival of the people. It constructs water wells in a quick and simple manner, which secure water supply for the people. Greenfinity, supported by donations from the Lyoness Community, financed the construction of 45 wells, which provide water for 800 people, a school and a hospital. For only 400 Euros a well can be built, which benefits up to 25 families.\\" When she was also asked about how she can promote her country, she replied, \\"I want to promote to perfect landscape of Austria, the beautiful lakes, clean rivers and water, lovely mountains and stunning cities with long history.

He co-wrote the song with Theresa Terry. The song was covered by Fats Domino and released as a single in 1953. It is now considered an iconic festive song of the New Orleans Carnival season. Background Henry Roeland Byrd, Better known as Professor Longhair (or nickname \\"Fess\\"), was born in Bogalusa and moved to New Orleans with his family as an infant. He reportedly learned to play his instrument on a piano lacking several keys, which some have credited for his unusual technique. He would keep time by kicking his foot against the piano's base. He developed a unique \\"rhumba boogie\\" style that combined elements of blues, barrelhouse, and Caribbean influences. He was a pivotal link between early New Orleans piano pioneers such as Tuts Washington and later names such as Fats Domino, Art Neville, Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.

The song's lyrics advise anyone wishing to visit New Orleans to go to the Mardi Gras celebration and witness its various sights, such as to \\"see the Zulu King on Saint Claude and Dumaine.\\" In 1959, at time of the recording, the Zulu parade, hosted by the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club, took an improvised route each year on the day of Mardi Gras, which would often pass this street intersection. \\"Go to the Mardi Gras,\\" along with a later record \\"Big Chief,\\" released in 1964, has become an iconic standard of the Carnival season. Release The song was first released as Mardi Gras in New Orleans by Professor Longhair and His Shuffling Hungarians in 1949 on a Star Talent 10\\" 78 RPM single. A version recorded in November 1949 and produced by Ahmet Ertugun and Herb Abramson was released as a 10\\" by Professor Longhair and his New Orleans Boys on Atlantic in February 1950. A third 1949 recording of the song has also been released. In 1959, Byrd re-recorded the song as Go to the Mardi Gras, which was produced by Joe Ruffino and released in December as a 7\\" and 10\\" on Ruffino's label, Ron Records. It featured Mac Rebennack on guitar, long before he became known as Dr. John. The song was also re-recorded in 1971 and released in 1991 on the album Mardi Gras in Baton Rouge. Another version was recorded in 1974 and included on the remixed 1985 version of his Rock 'n' Roll Gumbo album. Numerous live recordings of the song have also been released. The song also appeared on numerous compilation albums, including The Devil's Music - Keith Richards' personal compilation of Blues, Soul and R&B; Classics.

He and his wife Susannah Gabbert Bristow established the first church and donated land for the first school in Pleasant Hill.  Early life  Of English descent, Elijah Bristow was the eldest child of James Bristow and Delilah Elkins. He was born April 28, 1788, in the mountains of Tazewell County, Virginia. He became an expert marksman and hunter, serving in both the War of 1812 under General Andrew Jackson, and in the Black Hawk War. Historical narratives describe his spirit of adventure and his love for frontier life. He sought adventure as a young man, moving first to Overton County, Tennessee, where he married Susannah Gabbert in 1812; then to Cumberland County, Kentucky, in 1819 or 1820; then to Macoupin County, Illinois, and McDonough County, Illinois, where his family lived about 23 years. Bristow left his family in Blandinsville, Illinois, for the Pacific Coast in the spring of 1845.  Pioneering in Oregon  Crossing the plains by ox team, 58-year-old Bristow spent the winter of 1845 at Sutter's Fort, California, and in June 1846, set out by pony riding north with William Dodson, Felix Scott, and Eugene Skinner on an Indian trail that is now the old territorial road. They passed through the Siuslaw valley near the present day sites of Lorane, Crow, Elmira and Monroe, to Rickreall. The company traveled the east side of the Willamette Valley near present-day Salem, south to where the town of Jasper is presently located, and forded the Middle Fork Willamette River to the south side, seeing \\"a low ridge covered with scattering oak trees with timbered mountains rising above it.\\" Bristow is reported to have risen in his stirrups, and said, \\"There I will take my claim; and I am going to name it Pleasant Hill. That ridge with the mountains in the background reminds me of my boyhood home in old Virginia.\\" At Bristow's request, \\"the first territorial legislature passed an act naming his donation claim of 640 acres, Pleasant Hill.\\" His was the first claim and permanent cabin built in what would eventually become Lane County. (Donald McKenzie built a trapper's shack near the confluence of the McKenzie and Willamette rivers before 1825, but it was not a permanent residence.) The completion of Bristow's cabin by about October 1, 1846, marked the end of the exploration period and beginnings of settlement of the southern Willamette Valley, which had previously been visited exclusively by trappers, hunters, and explorers. Others settled nearby, and by 1848 the settlers had brief conflicts with some Klamath and Klickitat people. Bristow's family joined him in 1848, after he had written 15 letters, one to each of his children, inviting them to join him in Oregon. He served as the first postmaster in Lane County, and he and his wife donated land in 1849 for a church and school built in 1853, as well as land for the oldest cemetery in Lane County. Elijah Bristow died September 19, 1872, aged 84 years. He lived to see Oregon become a state in 1859, 13 years after he built the first cabin in Lane County.

In addition to Landeau the film also starred Bellamy Young, Eddie Izzard and Alessandro Nivola. It premiered at the 2015 Los Angeles Film Festival to mixed reviews. Plot Mia Roarke, an actress, is on a personal and professional high after appearing in a successful period piece Wild Sunset and getting engaged to her co-star, Liam. 10 years later, Mia is divorced from Liam and is struggling to book roles. Her agent gets her an audition with director Dag, who auditions her in a hotel room where he encourages her to take coke and forces her into the bathroom to take a shower. Leaving the hotel she runs into Liam who drives her home. She congratulates him on his engagement to a model, Elle, though in return he tells her that their engagement is by no means assured. Mia's neighbour Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Riley books a pilot and helps to arrange an audition for Mia who learns that the role is to play Charlie's character's mother. Her friend, Jen, sets her up with a recovering alcoholic who does pools and ends up insulting during the course of their date, telling her she's not as attractive as she once was. Mia's auditions for Charlie's pilot goes well and she begins to think that she has the role. After a day being gifted free clothing and accessories under the assumption that she has the role her agent calls her with the news that ultimately she didn't get it. On reshoots for a zombie thriller movie Mia fights with her director, Tark, on how to shoot a car crash scene. When she tells him she doesn't understand the point of yelling during a scene he humiliates her by insulting her career and her love life. A dejected Mia gives in and does the scene his way. Mia goes to meet her agent who hints that after 20 years of working together their relationship might be coming to a close. She afterwards has dinner with her mother and former manager who still keeps pictures of Mia and Liam around her apartment. After a day of drinking she calls Liam who answers her call and meets her at a bar. Though Liam is initially warm towards Mia, she mistakes his gestures as an overture and ends up trying to kiss him. The encounter is filmed and broadcast on the internet. Mia's agent tells her that the notoriety is good for her, but Mia is humiliated and decides to make a change. She contemplates selling her house and decides to cut off her mother. Just as she is in the middle of calling it quits her agent contacts her and tells her that her horror movie with Tark is testing well and the studio wants to sign her and all the other actors for sequels. Mia is offered directorial approval on the sequels to the zombie movies and has dinner with Tark and his agent who both grovel to her. She goes to a pawn shop to retrieve some jewelry she pawned when she was short on cash. She decides not to retrieve her engagement ring from Liam. Exiting the pawn shop she bumps into a man she doesn't remember who informs her that he was her driver on the set of her movie with Tark. Cast * Alexia Landeau as Mia Roarke * Christa B.

The hill rises to a height of above sea level, making it the highest of the Westhoek region. At the top of Mont Cassel is the commune of Cassel (Dutch: Kassel), about from the North Sea. Its geological composition comprises limestone capped with a very hard ferruginous layer of rock. History During the late Iron Age the hill of Cassel was inhabited by the Menapii, a Belgic tribe, who made the hill-top settlement the capital of a large territory extending from modern Calais to as far as the Rhine. The hilltop was probably used as an oppidum or hill fort. The Menapii were absorbed into the Roman province of Gallia Belgica in the first century B.C. Cassel was redeveloped as Castellum Menapiorum, the urban centre or civitas of the Menapii. The modern town and hill take their name from the Roman settlement. View from the north on Mont Cassel In the first centuries A.D., Mont Cassel was close to an inlet of the North Sea, making the settlement vulnerable to attacks from sea. In 928 the town on top of the hill was destroyed by Viking raids. By end of the 16th century Cassel had become a border town between France and the Spanish Netherlands. Cassel was annexed to France in 1678 under the terms of the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the Franco-Dutch War. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled. Mont Cassel was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, without the proximity of the border, the town had lost its strategic significance. During the early part of World War I Cassel served as the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch because of its strategic position near the northern end of the Western Front and to be closer to the Belgian headquarters at Veurne. From 1916-1918, Cassel was the headquarters for the British Second Army under Sir Herbert Plumer. The town avoided significant damage during the war, though it came under occasional shellfire when the Germans advanced to within during the Battle of the Lys in April 1918. Cycling The hill is a regular climb in road bicycle races in spring. It is regularly included in the Four Days of Dunkirk stage race and Gent–Wevelgem classic, where it comes in the early stages of the race. It is also regularly included in the Tour de l'Eurométropole. In 2014, it was included in the fourth stage of the Tour de France, coming halfway the course. Thomas Voeckler won the intermediate sprint on the top; Marcel Kittel won the stage in a bunch sprint. The road leading up from the bottom of the hill to the top is 1,700 m. The upper kilometre has a cobbled surface. Unlike the fearful sections of pavé in Paris–Roubaix, the surface is in excellent condition, as it is one of only two roads leading to the commune of Cassel.

It involves reorganization of the skeleton of certain unsaturated alcohols. It is a variation of the Cope rearrangement in which 1,5-dien-3-ols are converted to unsaturated carbonyl compounds by a mechanism typical for such a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The reaction is highly general: a wide variety of precursors undergo the reorganization predictably and with ease, rendering it a highly useful synthetic tool. Further, production of the required starting material is often straightforward. The modification was first proposed in 1964 by Berson and Jones, who coined the term. The driving force is the formation of a carbonyl via spontaneous keto-enol tautomerization. 526x526px Base accelerates the reaction by 1010-1017, the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. 523x523px The formation of an enolate renders the reaction irreversible in most cases.  History  Sigmatropic rearrangements are useful organic synthesis. In an effort to demonstrate the versatility of the Cope rearrangement by demonstrating its tolerance of an alcohol situated at C-3 of a 1,5-diene, Berson and Jones heated a bicyclic diene alcohol in the gas phase to give cis-∆5,6-octalone in fair yield. 309x309px The modification is immensely appealing as a result of the two new disparately placed functional groups that lend themselves well to a variety of previously unavailable synthetic manipulations. The next development occurred in 1975, when Evans and Golob reported the tremendous rate enhancements by base. Their use of potassium hydride in the cation's corresponding crown ether became the default approach for most applications. Indeed, in some cases, anionic assistance is intentionally forgone to accommodate for the production of overly sensitive enolate product. For example, in the following reaction only tar was obtained, a result that the authors attributed to the product's ostensible intolerance to base. The original oxy-Cope modification thus to this day occupies a relevant niche in synthetic chemistry. 325x325px  Mechanism  Both the neutral and anionic variants of the oxy-Cope rearrangement may occur via either concerted or stepwise radical pathways, although the former mode is generally favored. The preferred intermediate is characterized by a chair-like conformation. Chirality transfer is effected by a highly ordered transition state. The positioning of the double bonds in the most readily accessible transition state determines the stereochemical course of the reaction. A boat transition state is disfavored, but rearrangements occur via this path to an appreciable extent as well, resulting in the production of diastereomeric mixtures. 496x496px Steric effects can be significant. Rearrangements for which a chair transition state is geometrically impossible nonetheless occur. In fact, enolate formation provides enough of a driving force to overcome the energetic barrier associated with both dearomatization and the boat conformer. 617x617px The concerted, synchronous pathways presented above generally predominate; it was calculated for anionic oxy-Cope processes that a divide of 17-34 kcal/mol favors heterolysis over homolysis. Several factors may bridge this energetic gap. 387x387px The large degree of strain and the presence of a methyl group's bulk favored the (Z)- instead of the expected (E)-cyclooctenone isomer, suggesting that the intermediate is not formed synchronously. Only with fragmentation and subsequent isomerization steps could the observed product be rationalized. A study on the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement carried out entirely in the gaseous phase reported that the rate enhancement stems not from solvent interactions, but from those within the structure itself.  Rate enhancement  In general, decreasing the stability of the oxy-Cope or anionic oxy-Cope substrate relative to that of the product results in increased rate of reaction by the principle of ground state destabilization. This desirable outcome is readily achieved in a variety of ways. Ionic interactions between metal and alkoxide are important: dissociative character causes rate acceleration. Use of 15-crown-5 in conjunction with sodium hydride afforded a 1.27-fold rate enhancement over the course of a bicyclic diene alkoxide's sigmatropic conversion to enolate product, while the same reaction with HMPT in 15-crown-5's place did not appreciably affect the rate. The use of potassium hydride in conjunction with 18-crown-6 to achieve the same end afforded a 180-fold maximum rate acceleration. From the above results it was concluded that rate increases as counterions more poorly approximate point charges—and with the addition of counterion-sequestering species. The inclusion of more polar solvents and catalytic quantities of phase transfer salts has also been demonstrated to exert the same rate-enhancing effect. Finally, the relief of ring strain over the course of a rearrangement will drive a reaction more forcibly to completion, thereby increasing its rate.  Scope  Because there exist multiple classes of natural products containing eight-membered rings, the syntheses of which having proved difficult, the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement has been highlighted as a suitable alternative pathway. Its application here offers great stereochemical control, and its use is far more general than the relatively unsuccessful routes that had been employed before its development. 596x596px In spite of possible geometrical constraints, the required unsaturated substrates may contain triple bonds in place of either of the double bonds. Such an alkynol was effectively manipulated in the elegant synthesis of both poitediol and dactylol. These interesting sigmatropic rearrangements can occur either with anionic assistance or under thermal conditions. Of particular interest is the application of the oxy-Cope to situations in which the immediate product reacts further in a predictable manner to furnish a desired final product. This goal was achieved in the synthesis of the cis-hydroazulenone below, in which the oxy-Cope intermediate was characterized by a stereoelectronic configuration amenable to remote SN displacement.479x479px  Further considerations  Potassium hydride, a frequently utilized reagent for the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement, is occasionally contaminated with trace impurities that have been suggested to destroy the dienolate intermediate, resulting in putative polymerization. Macdonald et al., who documented the occurrence, prescribed pre-treatment with iodine to eliminate any potassium superoxide that may persist within a purchased batch of the material. This simple preparatory step, as they describe in their paper, effects dramatic improvement in both yield and reproducibility of results. Important side reactions include heterolytic cleavage, in which the homoallylic alcohol decomposes into a carbonyl and an allylic system. 442x442px Suppression of this phenomenon is readily achievable by decreasing the ionic nature of the metal-alkoxide bond. Specifically, the use of more electronegative alkali metals or solvents less amenable to cation solvation generates the desired effect. In keeping with the above discussion, the rate of reaction may be diminished but should not approach an unsatisfactory level.

Kangongo has a population of around 4000 inhabitants. History The history of Kangongo is closely linked with the history of the Hambukushu people, the easternmost of the five kingdoms of the Kavango people. Since independence of Namibia in 1990, Kangongo has gained very little investments, despite abundant agricultural, forestry, labour opportunities in the area. Kangongo is the main village and surrounded by various hamlets such as Shadithiki to the north east, Tjwatama and Shandhimbo to the south east, Ndarata in the Centre, Shakashondo to the west and Sharukuya to the north west, Teya in the South. The first primary school was established by the Roman Catholic missionaries and the historic building still stands where the school was housed. Kangongo also had a station for contract workers who were destined to work in South African mines. These workers were recruited from various villages but had to embark their journey to South Africa via Botswana from Kangongo.  Economy  Compared to many other Villages in Namibia, Kangongo is still underdeveloped. Like many Villages in Northern Namibia, Kangongo lacks infrastructure and basic services. The economy of Kangongo is characterized by subsistence farmers, with very little general services i.e. school, a small clinic and three shops. The village boasts a stones Crusher as a primary source of employment opportunities in the village. The crusher is currently owned by Gecko Namibia (Pty) Ltd. Kangongo also has a fish farm run by a cooperative comprises members drawn from the Kangongo community. At present the fish farm needs re-investment in terms of infrastructure and capital for it to operate optimally.  Schools  * Kangongo Combined School The school has Grade 0 up to Grade 9 and also cater for the communities in the surrounding villages apart from Kangongo itself. The school has a Board that oversee governance matters. Kangongo Combined School has grown from the primary school which was introduced by the missionaries to where it is now today to be called a Combined School. This school historical has produced learners that are currently contributing to the development of Namibia in general and Kangongo in particular.  Health: Hospitals/ Clinics * Kangongo Clinic  Sports and Recreation  The village's main sports club is called Kango Western Tops. It has both football and netball sides. Kangongo boasts several feeder clubs within the village. They are commonly known as \\"sub-teams within the village\\". All these feeder clubs have football and netball sides. The Kangongo Sub-Teams are: #New Action SC (Tjwatama, Kangongo) #Juventus SC (Ndarata, Kangongo) #Kango Chiefs SC (Shakashondo, Kangongo) #Makore Cosmos SC (Teya, Kangongo) #Blue Waters SC (Rukuro, Kangongo) #Kango Legends SC (Legends, Kangongo) Twin Villages – Sister Towns Kangongo is twinned with: * Divundu, Namibia * Nieuwegein, Netherlands * Gudhjem, Denmark References Populated places in Kavango East ","title":"Kangongo, Namibia"},{"id":"48707189","text":"Bear Skull Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of California.

It is a methodology for ship launching utilizing air bags.ISO 17682-2013 Ships and marine technology — Methodology for ship launching utilizing air bags The Xiao Qinghe shipyard launched a tank barge with marine airbags on January 20, 1981 and it is known as the first use of marine airbags. This kind of ship launching method has the advantages of requiring less permanent infrastructure, risk, and cost. The airbags provide support to the hull of the ship, air bags rolling motion take a vessel launch into water, thus it is arguably safer than other options like sideways launching. Unlike most other launching methods that are fixed infrastructures, airbag launching has relatively less limitations and can be used in versatile ways. It overcomes the disadvantage of fixed track launching in which capacity of shipbuilding and ship repairing is limited by the fixed infrastructures especially in small and medium-sized shipyards. Airbags Ship launching airbags are specialized air bags that are used for launching marine vessels. These air bags are made of synthetic-tire-cord reinforcement layers and rubber layers,ISO14409-Ships and marine technology of Ship launching air bags and are also known as marine airbags. They were invented in 1980. The first known use of marine airbags occurred on January 20, 1981 with the launch of a tank barge from the Xiao Qinghe shipyard. From then on, more and more shipyards, especially in China and Southeast Asia, began to use air bags to launch small and medium-sized vessels. In recent years, higher strength materials have been used in air bag production, allowing them to have much more bearing capacity. Hence, they have begun to be used at the launchings of larger vessels. In October 2011, the successful launch of one vessel with a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 75000 tonnes set a world record for ship launches utilizing air bags. The following year, on June 6, 2012, the ship \\"He Ming\\" (IMO number 9657105), with a DWT of 73541 tonnes, total length of 224.8m, breadth of 34m, and depth of 18.5m, also launched successfully using air bags. Air bag structure 606x606px Marine air bags consist of three parts: # Air bag body: the main, cylindrical part of the air bag after being fully inflated with compressed air, # Air bag heads: conical parts connecting the body and the mouths of the air bag, and # Air bag mouths: either metal valves mounted on both ends of the air bag for inflating with air or a valve on one end and a metal lug on the other end used to haul the air bag. Air bag size and model Size The diameter of an air bag varies; sizes include 0.8 m, 1.0 m, 1.2 m, 1.5 m, 1.8 m, etc. The length of an air bag is specified by the customer when it is manufactured. Model Air bags are commonly divided into three to six tire-cord reinforcement layers. There can be more layers, though there are normally less than ten. Air bag bearing capacity The maximum load carrying capacity of an air bag, which is the maximum load under which it will suffer no permanent deformation or damage, can be found as follows: left Let: D be the original diameter of the air bag H be the height of the compressed air bag W_{1} be the width of the air bag contacting the ship bottom P_{1} be the internal pressure of the air bag L be the effective length of the air bag Given these variables, \\\\text{bearing capacity} = P_{1} \\\\times W_{1} \\\\times L  Air bag materials  Ship launching air bags are constructed of synthetic-tire-cord layers; inner and outer rubber layers are sometimes added. All materials used are vulcanized.  Air bag test  Air tightness test: Without carrying any load, fill the air bag till the internal pressure of the air bag reaches rated working pressure. After 1 hour. The pressure loss should be less than 5 % of initial pressure. Bursting test： Fill the air bag with water until the air bag bursts. The water pressure at the time of bursting shall be no less than three times of rated working pressure.  The arrangements of air bags   Launching type  Based on the ship shapes, the ship may be launched, using air bags, by either end launching type or side launching type  End launching type  There are three ways to arrange air bags when using the end launching type. They are (1) linear arrangement (see Figure A.1), (2) staggered arrangement (see Figure A.2), and (3) two-lines arrangement (see Figure A.3). As for which arrangement to use, it will depend on the ship's width and the length of the air bags. When the ship's width is not greater than the effective length of the air bags, the linear arrangement shall be selected thumb When the ship's width is greater than the effective length of an air bag and less than the effective length of two air bags, the staggered arrangement can be selected. 353x353px When the ship's width is greater than the combined effective length of two air bags, or for special ship such as catamaran HSC or split hopper barge, the two lines arrangement shall be selected. The distance between the near ends of two air bags is greater than 0,2 m. centre  Side launching type  For small flat-bottom ships, the side launching method may be utilized (see Figure A.4) 375x375px  Air bags quantity  Air bags shall meet the requirements of ISO 14409ISO14409-Ships and marine technology of Ship launching air bags According to the weight of the ship being launched, the quantity of the air bags needed for this operation must be calculated in accordance with Formula (1): 298x298px where N is the quantity of air bags used for ship launching; K1 is a coefficient, in general, K1 ≥ 1,2; Q is the weight of the ship (ton); g is acceleration of gravity (m/s2), g = 9,8; Cb is the block coefficient of the ship being launched; R is the allowable unit bearing capacity of the air bags (kN/m); Ld is the contact length between the bottom of the ship and the body of the air bag at the midship section (m). For ship shifting, 2 to 4 additional air bags shall be made ready and available. The centre to centre distance between two neighbouring air bags should be less than or equal to that found in Formula (2) and equal to or be greater than that found in Formula (3). 287x287px where L is the actual length of the ship bottom that can make contact with the air bags (m); N is the quantity of air bags used for ship launching; k is a coefficient, k = 1 for steel ships, k = 0,8 for wooden, aluminium and glass-fibre-reinforced ships; D is the nominal diameter of air bags (m).  Slipway  The gradient and the length of the slipway shall be determined according to the size of the ship and the hydrological condition of the area water. The bearing capacity of the slipway shall be at least twice as strong as the working pressure of air bags. For ships of more than 3 000 tons of length, more than 120m,the slipway shall be constructed with reinforced concrete and the height difference between the right and left sides shall be less than 20 mm. For ships of more than 1 000 tons but less than or equal to 3 000 tons in weight, or more than 90 m but less than or equal to 120 m in length, the slipway shall be constructed with cement concrete and the height difference between the right and left sides shall be less than 50 mm. For ships of not more than 1 000 tons in weight or not more than 90 m in length, the slipway may be an earthen slope and shall be compacted even by rollers. The height difference between the right and left sides shall be less than 80 mm. The main slipway shall enable the ship to glide automatically when the ship is off the tow. The auxiliary slipway shall be determined according to the ship type, the water level at time of launching, the diameter of the air bags, and the safety requirements.  Towing arrangement  A windlass shall be used to control the movement of the ship. Tow system that comprises windlass, steel wire rope and pulley set shall be securely fastened to the ground anchor in front of the berth. In general, a slow windlass shall be selected for ship launching. The veering speed of the windlass shall be 9 m/min to 13 m/min. The forces of the windlass and the steel wire rope should be calculated carefully by technicians of ship yards or air bags company. 437x437px See also Ship launching airbag References Marine engineering ","title":"Airbag launching"},{"id":"48707255","text":"ViewQwest is an Internet service provider (ISP) that provides fiber broadband services to both businesses and residential users.

The two available sites are bounded by a double well potential of which its shape, width and height are determined by a set of boundary conditions. According to the WKB approximation, the probability for a particle to tunnel is inversely proportional to its mass and the width of the potential barrier. Electron tunneling is well-known. A proton is about 2000 times more massive than an electron, so it has a much lower probability of tunneling; nevertheless, proton tunneling still occurs especially at low temperatures and high pressures where the width of the potential barrier is decreased. Proton tunneling is usually associated to hydrogen bonds. In many molecules that contain hydrogen, the hydrogen atoms are linked to two non-hydrogen atoms via a hydrogen bond at one end and a covalent bond at the other. A hydrogen atom without its electron is reduced to being a proton. Since the electron is no longer bound to the hydrogen atom in a hydrogen bond, this is equivalent to a proton resting in one of the wells of a double well potential as described above. When proton tunneling occurs, the hydrogen bond and covalent bonds are switched. Once proton tunneling occurs, the same proton has the same probability of tunneling back to its original site provided the double well potential is symmetrical. The base pairs of a DNA strand are connected by hydrogen bonds. In essence, the genetic code is contained by a unique arrangement of hydrogen bonds. It is believed that upon the replication of a DNA strand there is a probability for proton tunneling to occur which changes the hydrogen bond configuration; this leads to a slight alteration of the hereditary code which is the basis of mutations. Likewise, proton tunneling is also believed to be responsible for the occurrence of the dysfunction of cells (tumors and cancer) and ageing. Proton tunneling occurs in many hydrogen based molecular crystals such as ice. It is believed that the phase transition between the hexagonal (ice Ih) and orthorhombic (ice XI) phases of ice is enabled by proton tunneling. The occurrence of correlated proton tunneling in clusters of ice has also been reported recently.

(2009). Complex processes in simple ices - Laboratory and observational studies of gas-grain interactions during star formation (Ph.D.). Leiden University. She is a Professor of Astronomy at Harvard University and leader of the Öberg Astrochemistry Group at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. She is best known for her work studying star formation, planet formation, and stellar evolution in relation to organic molecules, which are necessary to determine the origins of life on Earth and elsewhere. In April 2015, Öberg's group discovered the first complex organic molecule in a protoplanetary disk.  Early life  Karin Öberg was born on August 27, 1982, in Nyköping, Sweden. At age 6, her family relocated to Karlskrona, where she spent the rest of her childhood. She was raised alongside two brothers, and attended public primary, secondary, and high schools. In 2001, Öberg's high school chemistry teacher signed her up for the local Chemistry Olympiad. Öberg ended up winning her way to the international competition, being one of four students to represent Sweden. Also during her senior year at Chapmanskolan Gymnasiest High School, Öberg conducted a project under the supervision of her father, which resulted in her first publication.  Education  Öberg was educated at the California Institute of Technology and graduated cum laude in 2005 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry. She claims that \\"Caltech was a birth through fire experience into science, which taught [her] to think, to ask questions, and to solve problems as [she] scarce had thought [her] mind capable of.\\" During her time as an undergraduate, Öberg was a member of physical chemistry and astrochemistry research groups led by Dr. Jack Beauchamp and Dr. Geoffrey Blake, respectively. Conducting research in these groups resulted in two publications for Öberg. Dr. Geoff Blake was especially influential to Öberg because he ushered her interest in astrochemistry, the field in which she researches today. Öberg's passion for astrochemistry was solidified when Dr. Blake took his group to visit the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Following her undergraduate studies, Öberg took up a Ph.D. position at Leiden University in the Netherlands under the supervision of Dr. Ewine van Dishoeck and Dr. Harold Linnartz. She spent four years combining laboratory simulation and astronomical observation to study the chemistry and dynamics of interstellar ice. This research led to a thesis, titled \\"Complex processes in simple ices: Laboratory and observational studies of gas-grain interactions during star formation.\\" Öberg presented the different chapters at conferences worldwide and several institutions in the United States. The doctoral thesis was defended on September 16, 2009. Besides conducting this research, Öberg supervised two M.Sc. projects and served as a teaching assistant for courses on Pulsars and research for undergraduate students. She graduated cum laude with a Ph.D. in Astronomy from Leiden University in 2009.  Career  After Öberg received her Ph.D. in 2009, NASA awarded her a Hubble Postdoctoral Fellowship. She used this funding to research at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics until August 2012. During this time, she studied the radioastronomical observations of organic molecules in young stars, such as protoplanetary disks and protostars. Next, Öberg worked at the University of Virginia as a visiting scholar and Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Astronomy until June 2013. At U.Va., Öberg conducted laboratory ice experiments and studied spatially- and spectrally-determined astronomical observations, both of which focused on the processes that take place during the chemical evolution of a planet or star. Öberg returned to Harvard in July 2013 as an Assistant Professor of Astronomy. Here, she formed the Öberg Astrochemistry Group. This group conducts research at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Öberg is currently still working with this group in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Öberg serves on the board of the Society of Catholic Scientists.https://www.catholicscientists.org/board  Research  Öberg has published over 63 refereed articles, 25 of those as the first author, and has been cited over 3250 times. Her main domain of work currently pertains to astrochemistry and its effect on planet formation. The Öberg Astrochemistry Group, her current research group, states that their main research addresses the following: The group's research is composed of laboratory ice simulations and radio and infrared observations of astronomical behaviors and information.  Discovery of a complex molecule in a protoplanetary disk  On April 9, 2015, the Öberg Astrochemistry Group published a paper stating they detected the first complex carbon molecule in a protoplanetary disk, this molecule being methyl cyanide. Methyl cyanide (CH3CN) is thought to be important for the origins of life because it contains carbon-nitrogen bonds, which make up amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Up until this discovery, it was unclear if these molecules could exist in abundance in young disks because of their turbulent and chaotic nature. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Öberg's group was able to survey the orbital debris of the newly formed star MWC 480, to discover enough methyl cyanide to fill all of Earth's oceans and the presence of other simpler molecules such as hydrogen cyanide. This discovery is significant because it shows that the backbone of life, complex carbon bonds, are not exclusive to our Solar System. In an interview, Öberg stated that comet records suggest the presence of complex organic molecules in other protoplanetary disks as well. The finding was published in the scientific journal Nature (volume 520), titled \\"The comet-like composition of a protoplanetary disk as revealed by complex cyanides.\\" It also had media coverage in The Washington Post and LA Times, along with a press release from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).

Early life Moncrieff was born in Hope, near Nelson, New Zealand, one of four children of Dorothy and Jack Dick, a sawmill owner. Both Dorothy and Jack were artists and performers — Dorothy painted, sang, acted and performed in comedy shows, and Jack played the piano and had his own dance band. As a child, Moncrieff created her own plays, painting the sets and drawing the characters as well. Moncrieff studied at Waimea College, Richmond, and particularly enjoyed art and sculpting. Although she wanted to be an artist, her application to art school was declined and instead she enrolled to study at Christchurch Teachers' College. She didn't enjoy it and returned to Nelson after about 14 months. She worked in a psychiatric hospital and returned to sculpting in her 30s. After two marriages and two divorces, friends encouraged Moncrieff to change her surname to something of her own choosing. She chose \\"Moncrieff\\", a name from her mother's Shetland Islands ancestry. Career Moncrieff's first sculpture exhibition was held in Wellington in the early 1980s. She was disappointed by the high fees the gallery charged her, and decided to open her own gallery. She and six other artists joined together and bought a dilapidated old cottage, Cobb Cottage, on the main road out of Nelson, and named the gallery the William Higgins Gallery after the man who built it. The building was added to the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga List in 1986 as a Category 1 historic place. As it was outside of town, she decided to promote the gallery by running an annual sculpture competition. The prize money was donated by the company which had sold Moncrieff the cottage; however, the firm was later bought out by a multinational company and the prize money withdrawn. As an alternative promotion, Moncrieff organised the first WOW show in 1987. It was a stage show combining wearable art, theatre and dance, and held at Cobb Cottage with an audience of 200. The show became so successful that in 2005 Moncrieff moved it to Wellington in order to have a larger venue. The show has sold out every year it has been staged, and a 2009 study estimated that the show contributes $15 million to the city's economy. In 2012, a 70-minute show was presented at the Hong Kong Arts Festival. Honours and awards In the 1998 Queen's Birthday Honours, Moncrieff was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the arts and tourism. She was promoted to Dame Companion of the same order, for services to the arts, in the 2012 New Year Honours. Moncrieff was named Wellingtonian of the Year in the arts category in 2011. The following year she was a finalist in the 2012 New Zealander of the Year awards, and in 2014 she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree by Massey University. In 2015 she received a Deloitte top 200 visionary leader award.

Valmet designed and made Valmet L-70 Vinka and Valmet L-90 Redigo. It also designed the Tuuli III and L-89 Turbovinha. It also had a license to make Fouga Magister, Saab Draken and BAe Hawk. The products were later moved to Patria Finavitec Oy and Patria company's Patria Aviation Oy.  Aerospace  Main tasks were the assembly and licence production of Fouga Magister trainers, Saab Draken fighters and BAe Hawk trainers. The Tampere factory was closed in the 1960s and main part of the aircraft factory became the facility at Kuorevesi. Domestically- designed aircraft included the Valmet Vihuri in the 1950s, the Valmet Vinka in the late 1970s and the Valmet Redigo in the mid-1980s. A line of military trainer aircraft for the Finnish Air Force developed and manufactured by Valmet include the L-70 Vinka and L-90 Redigo. After the Finnish state privatized Valmet in 1996, the aviation division was detached and integrated into Finnish defense industries, Patria, as Patria Finavitec. The military part is mostly state-owned but EADS owns 27 per cent of Patria. This period started with the assembly of F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft and NH90 helicopters. Civilian work increased in the form of participating in design and manufacture of parts for Airbus aircraft, most notably A380 spoilers.  Airplanes  *Valmet Tuuli II *Valmet Vihuri *Valmet Vinka *Valmet L-90 TP Redigo  Saab-Valmet  In 1968 Valmet and Saab started a company called Saab-Valmet. It had a car factory in Uusikaupunki and it produced mainly Saab cars, although Talbots were also built. The factory is now Valmet Automotive.  Paper mills  Valmet made paper mill machinery and process control equipment. Valtion tykkitehdas produced artillery pieces for the Finnish Army along with Tampella AB industries. After World War II production switched to paper mills. Paper machines production technology was made in Rautpohja fun factory by Uolevi Konttinen, Olavi Miekk-oja and a technician. Unlike for many other gun factories it was easier for Valmet to change their products. The first two paper machines were made for Metalexport to Poland in 1953. In 1969 it made an agreement to make paper and cardboard machines with Tampella and Wärtsilä. Valmet concentrated to make paper machines for making paper for newspapers, magazines and bags. The companies had a common marketing organization. Metso Paper had a company in China's Xi'an with a local partner. The company was called Metso Paper Technology (Xi'an) Co.

In the beginning of 1960's Valmet made a tractor factory to Brazil and later one in Tanzania. Valmet took over Volvo BM's tractor production in the 1980s. In 1994 Valmet sold the Valmet (tractor) to Sisu Auto which Partek bought in 1997. Partek came part of Kone in 2002. It sold the tractors to AGCO Corporation. The company makes tractors in Äänekoski's Suolahti factory. In 2001 they took Valtra trademark into use. Originally Valtra was a product name of Valmet's products.

A concert hall, it is in the Art Deco architectural tradition.  History  This church, in basilica with two aisles and a bell tower is the work of the engineer , who built it at his own expense using the material that made his fortune: reinforced concrete. In the early twentieth century, the city of Hirson opened the second railway marshalling yard in France after Paris. Its population was growing and the church could not accommodate all the people. The childless Aimé Bonna, who was very attached to his roots, decided to build the Church of Sainte-Thérèse-de-l'Enfant-Jésus at his own expense. He acquired the land, financed materials and labour and supervised the construction, which began on October 3, 1929. Unfortunately, Aimé Bonna died six months before it was completed. A chapel was erected to house his remains, his funeral having been held in this church. The campanile, which had become dilapidated and dangerous, was demolished in 2008. In September 2012, the Anglo-American pianist and composer Kit Armstrong purchased the remainder of the building, which he refurbished as a concert hall, where a festival featuring classical music and art exhibitions takes place.https://www.aisnenouvelle.fr/id34127/article/2019-09-03/kit-armstrong- invite-des-peintres-de-fresnoy-le-grand-exposer-dans-son-eglise The opening concert took place on 3 June 2014.Julien Bordier, Bienvenue à l'autel, L'Express n°3281, 21-27 mai 2014, pp.108-11.  Description  The 23-metre church was designed by Jacques Martin. On the left side was a bell tower 45 metres high, but this was demolished on 23 November 2008. It comprised a central door and two side doors opening onto the aisles. Above, a large lintel decorated with bas-reliefs is surmounted by a statue of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux sculpted by Jacques Martin. The internal styling is Art Deco with a decorated vaulted ceiling and 1500 plaster roses, symbolizing the roses spread by St Therese. The church was part of the Paroisse Notre Dame de Thiérache (Parish of Notre Dame of Thiérache) in the diocese of Soissons, Laon and Saint-Quentin.  Transformation into a concert hall  In August 2013 the Société Musicale Sainte-Thérèse was created. This is an association to renovate and maintain the church, host musicians and artists, organize private and public concerts and promote cultural events in the Church.Parution au Journal Officel n° 20130037  References   Links  * Hirson * Thiérache Concert halls in France Churches in Aisne Art Deco architecture in France 1931 establishments in France ","title":"Sainte-Thérèse-de-l'Enfant-Jésus, Hirson"},{"id":"48707918","text":"White Horse is an unincorporated community in Bucks County, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.

It was occupied by Aboriginal Australians as recently as 3,100 years BP but was found to be unoccupied by the first European explorers to visit it in the early 19th century. It was first settled by Europeans as early as the 1830s. As of 2011, it had a population of 595 people. Extent Dudley Peninsula is the eastern end of Kangaroo Island. It is connected to the main body of the island via an isthmus which itself forms the southern side of Pelican Lagoon. The peninsula is bounded to the west by Pelican Lagoon, American River and Eastern Cove all within Nepean Bay, to the north-east by Backstairs Passage from Kangaroo Head in the west to Cape Willoughby in the east and to the south by the body of water known in Australia as the Southern Ocean and by international authorities as the Great Australian Bight.DMH, 1985, chart 11BIA, 2005, page 184 Dudley Peninsula is at the right hand side of the image Naming The first reported European name for the Dudley Peninsula is \\"Presquila Gallissoniere\\" which was given by the Baudin Expedition.DPTI, Search result for Presquila Gallissoniere (record no. SA0025371), 2015 In 1857, it was named the \\"MacDonnell Peninsula\\" by William Bloomfield Douglas after Richard Graves MacDonnell, the sixth governor of South Australia.DPTI, Search result for MacDonnell Peninsula (record no. SA0041824), 2015 On 20 March 1986, it was renamed as the \\"Dudley Peninsula\\" to be \\"in keeping with local usage.\\" History Aboriginal use The archaeological record indicates that Kangaroo Island was occupied by Aboriginal Australians as early as 16,110 years BP. European explorers visiting in the early 19th century found no evidence of human occupation as evident by lack of smoke from fires which was common along the Australian coastline at the time, overgrown vegetation that had not been managed by \\"firestick farming\\" and animals such as seals and kangaroos \\"appeared unused to human presence\\". Aboriginal sites have been identified by the South Australian Museum and others on the Dudley Peninsula. As of 1999, radiocarbon dating of material recovered via archaeological excavation from a site called Pigs Waterhole on the peninsula suggest aboriginal presence in the eastern end of Kangaroo Island as recently as 3,100 years BP.Robinson et al., 1999, pages 33 -36 European discovery and settlement Memorial rock marking the place where Baudin came ashore at Penneshaw on Kangaroo Island in 1803 Dudley Peninsula was first visited by European navigators in 1802 when the British navigator, Matthew Flinders, explored its north coast during March 1802. After meeting Flinders at Encounter Bay in April 1802, the Baudin expedition visited the peninsula's north coast later in April 1802 and explored its south coast during January 1803.Robinson et al, 1989–90, page 49Marsden, 1991, pages 2–3Robinson et al., 1996, pages 116 & 119 Formal settlement commenced in 1836 with a fleet under the control of the South Australian Company arriving at what is now Kingscote further west on Kangaroo Island. Some of the people who had been living on that part of Kangaroo Island prior to 1836 moved to the peninsula to avoid being within the jurisdiction of the South Australian Company and thereby making it \\"most prosperous part of the island and the scene of its first significant agricultural and pastoral development.\\"Marsden, 1991, page 8 The full extent of Kangaroo Island was gazetted on 13 August 1874 as the cadastral division known as the County of Carnarvon simultaneously with the creation of another cadastral division, the Hundred of Dudley, which covers the full extent of what is now the Dudley Peninsula. In 1875, land in the Hundred of Dudley near the north coast of the peninsula was surveyed and given freehold title in response for the demand for agricultural land.Marsden, 1991, pages 10–11 The town of Penneshaw was proclaimed on 12 January 1882. On 7 June 1888, the local government area of the District Council of Dudley was established. This was subsequently merged in 1996 with the District Council of Kingscote to create the Kangaroo Island Council. Natural geography Geomorphology and geology The Dudley Peninsula came into existence about 9,500 years BP when Kangaroo Island became separate from what is now Fleurieu Peninsula due to the rise in sea level following the end of the last ice age.DEP, 1987, page 7 The peninsula has a plateau covering its northern half with a maximum height of about while the southern half has a maximum height in the order of . Its coastline consists of a cliff-line in the order of to in height with the exception of sandy bays such as Nepean Bay in the north-west coast, Antechamber Bay in the north east coast and Pennington Bay on the south-west coast. The peninsula has a geological basement of Tapanappa Formation sandstones (from the Kanmantoo Group) which were laid during the early Cambrian period. The basement stratum has undergone extensive erosion to create laterite based soil which covers the northern half of the peninsula. The southern half of the peninsula has a Bridgewater Group limestone which was laid over the basement stratum during the Pleistocene and which has eroded to form a dune field.Robinson et al., 1989–90, pages 21 & 29 Climate The Dudley Peninsula has a mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csb) (direct: Final Revised Paper) As of 2002, Penneshaw received an annual rainfall of and this average is considered to increase to at the top of the peninsula's plateau.Henschke, 2002, page 1 Human geography Settlements Settlements on the Dudley Peninsula consist of Penneshaw which overlooks Backstairs Passage on the north coast with the following being located on the north west coast overlooking Nepean Bay (from east to west) – Baudin Beach, Island Beach and Sapphiretown.DPTI, 2014, pages 301 & 302 Demographics At the 2011 census, the Dudley Peninsula had a population of 595 with 276 persons located in Penneshaw and the remaining 319 located on the remainder of the peninsula, being the localities of American Beach, Antechamber Bay, Baudin Beach, Brown Beach, Cuttlefish Bay, Dudley East, Dudley West, Ironstone, Island Beach, Kangaroo Head, Pelican Lagoon, Porky Flat, Sapphiretown, Willoughby and Willson River. Land use As of 1989, most of the northern side of the peninsula above a line from Cape Willoughby in the east to Strawbridge Point at the junction of American River and Eastern Cove in the west has been progressively cleared for agricultural purposes while the southern side has retained most of its native vegetation. Subsequent clearing of native vegetation on a broadacre scale ceased in 1990 with the proclamation of the Native Vegetation Act 1990.Robinson et al., 1989–90, pages 50 & 52 As of 2014, majority of the land on the Dudley Peninsula has been zoned by law for agricultural use (i.e. \\"primary production\\") followed by conservation including most of the coastal perimeter with exception to some parts of the Nepean Bay coastline and by residential use.DPTI, 2014, pages 300, 305 & 309 Transport Roads The peninsula is served by a road network extending from both Penneshaw on its northern coast and from Hog Bay Road, a road maintained by the South Australian Government. Hog Bay Road which follows the peninsula's north-western coastline connects Penneshaw and the settlements overlooking Nepean Bay with the town of Kingscote and the rest of Kangaroo Island. Sea As of 2014, port infrastructure at Penneshaw was being used by Kangaroo Island SeaLink who operates the ferry service between Penneshaw and Cape Jervis on the South Australian mainland. Navigation aids located on the peninsula's coast include lighthouses at both Cape St Albans and Cape Willoughby. Aviation As of 2014, no public airfields were located within the extent of the Dudley Peninsula with the nearest and the only one available being the Kingscote Airport on the western part of the island in the locality of Cygnet River.DPTI, 2014, pages 111 & 271Kangaroo Island Council, 2013, page 17 Governance The Dudley Peninsula is located within the jurisdiction of the Kangaroo Island Council and within the following electorates – the state district of Finniss and the federal division of Mayo.DPTI, 2014, page 15 Protected areas As of 2015, the Dudley Peninsula contained the following conservation parks – Baudin, Cape Willoughby, Dudley, Lashmar, Lesueur, Pelican Lagoon and Simpson. Also, as of 2015, an area of privately owned land appropriately equivalent to that of the above conservation parks has protected status due to being subject to native vegetation heritage agreements.

He completed it in 1900 on a text by Viktor Rydberg. It was first performed in Helsinki on 20 October 1900, with the Orchestra of the Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by Robert Kajanus.  History  The poem had previously been set in full by Wilhelm Stenhammar (Op.5) in 1891.Andrew Barnett Sibelius 2007 \\"Unlike Stenhammar, who had set this poem to music in 1891, Sibelius selected only extracts from the poem. \\" Sibelius composed the work in the fall of 1900 on a poem by Viktor Rydberg. He later noted: \\"I wrote Snöfrid more or less at one sitting after I came home from three days of lively celebrations\\". The plot on which it is based is inspired by old Scandinavian balladic stories. A female protagonist appeals to her compatriots, in particular a hero, to fight for freedom as a higher goal than fortune, fame and pleasure. Sibelius was inspired by several works by Rydberg, including solo songs and Skogsrået (The Wood Nymph). He liked Rydberg's free verse, expressing both erotic and political ideas. The heroic element possibly appealed to his own battles \\"with everybody and everything\\". Sibelius chose dramatic scenes from the poem, such as Snöfrid's \\"If you choose me, then you choose the tempest.\\" The instrumental prelude depicts a storm at night, with whining strings, howling brass, thundering percussion, but \\"dominated by melodic and harmonic elements\\". The work was first performed in Helsinki on 20 October 1900, with the Orchestra of the Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by Robert Kajanus. The occasion was a lottery to finance a tour of the orchestra to Paris. An unsigned review in the newspaper Päivälehti noted: Later Sibelius composed the last movement on a different text, Volter Kilpi's Ylistys taiteelle. This version was first performed on 9 April 1902.  Recordings  Snöfrid is the title of a 2001 recording of this work along with other music by Sibelius, including the Cantata for the Coronation of Nicholas II, Rakastava (The Lover), Oma maa (My country) and Andante Festivo.

It grows in deserts and arid regions of north Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and southwestern Asia.  Taxonomy  Salsola imbricata was first described in 1775 by the Swedish naturalist Peter Forsskål. In 1849, Alfred Moquin-Tandon transferred it to the genus Caroxylon, making it Caroxylon imbricatum (Forssk.) Moq., but later it was mostly accepted in genus Salsola. Following a phylogenetic analysis of Salsoloideae in 2007 by Akhani, H., et al., it has been proposed to place Salsola imbricata back to Caroxylon imbricatum. This matter is unresolved by ThePlantList, but accepted by GBIF.  Description  S. imbricata is a small, spreading shrub or sub-shrub growing up to tall. The grey or reddish stems are up to thick and these and the lower leaves are densely hairy. In the upper parts of the plant the stems are creamy or pale grey and branch frequently, some branches growing vertically while others spread horizontally. Regularly-arranged, catkin-like branchlets project from the branches. The leaves are tiny, succulent and linear or narrowly triangular. The inflorescence is spike-like with bracts similar to the leaves, small flowers with 5 petals, 5 stamens and 2 styles. The fruiting perianth has silky wings.  Distribution and habitat  This plant has a widespread distribution across the desert belt of Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, southern Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and northwestern India. It typically grows in disturbed areas such as runnels, washes, dry wadis, eroded slopes and coastal cliffs. It grows on various soil types and is a ruderal species, colonising fallow land and over-grazed pastures.  Ecology  S. imbricata is a halophytic plant; under conditions of salt stress, the plant increases its water content (becomes more succulent) and decreases the surface area of its leaves. Tests on the germination rates of seeds show that Salsola imbricata sprouts more quickly and consistently at 20 °C than at higher temperatures, and shows higher germination rates at lower salinity levels than high ones. However, seeds treated at high salinity levels recovered their germination potential after immersion in unsalted water. The species has traditionally been used as a vermifuge and for treating certain skin disorders. Five triterpene glycosides have been isolated from the roots of Salsola imbricata, two of them being new glycoside derivatives not previously known.

He was noted early for his prolific output and social charm, and he entertained a circle of notable authors at his home, often showing-off his skill at mimicking authors’ handwriting. But it became clear that he was putting this gift to criminal use, forging cheques and signatures, and he was repudiated by Dickens, Browning, and others. In 1849 he moved to New York to avoid prosecution, and many American publications printed an accusation by Dickens, which he was unable to substantiate and had to withdraw, settling with Powell out of court. Early career By the age of 21, London-born Powell was contributing work to the literary Fraser’s Magazine, often using the pen name Pierce Pungent. He was a published poet, and his works included The Count de Foix, a Tale of the Olden Time, Poems, Dramatic Poems and Tales from Boccaccio. He also wrote plays including The Wife’s Revenge, The Blind Wife and The Shepherd’s Well. He entertained a literary circle at his home in Peckham, South London, that included writers such as Robert Browning, Leigh Hunt, and R.H. Horne. In 1841, he was one of the contributors to the writing of The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer Modernized; others involved with the project included Richard Henry Horne (editor), Elizabeth Barrett Browning, William Wordsworth, Leigh Hunt, Robert Bell, and Leonhard Schmitz. However, Powell later fell out of favour with his fellow authors. Horne wrote of Powell that he was “a dog he repudiates forever” and Robert Browning, in a letter of the same year (1846), warned Elizabeth Barrett Browning not to trust Powell \\"his impudence and brazen insensibility are dreadful to encounter beyond all belief”. Charles Dickens Powell was employed as a clerk in the shipping business of John Chapman & Co. of 2 Leadenhall Street in London. Charles Dickens was acquainted with the principal partners in the firm and asked them to find a position for his young brother Augustus Dickens. Powell acted as Augustus' mentor, earning the thanks and appreciation of Charles Dickens, who occasionally socialised and corresponded with Powell on friendly and informal terms. Forgery, embezzlement and fraud For amusement, Powell showed off his ability to mimic his fellow authors' handwriting and signatures. He sold documents purported to be original letters and books inscribed by the authors, but some of these were thought to be forgeries and their authenticity was questioned. He also embezzled a large sum of money from John Chapman & Co., his employer, and when these activities were uncovered, he attempted suicide by taking an overdose of laudanum. In consideration of Powell’s family, the directors of John Chapman & Co. decided not to prosecute. In 1848, Powell was again in trouble when a warrant was issued for his arrest for obtaining money with false cheques. He was released on bail and ordered to appear the next day in court. When he failed to attend, his solicitor informed the court that he was in an asylum, certified insane. The case was adjourned for two weeks, during which time the police discovered evidence of further fraud. At the next hearing in January 1849, the court was told that Powell “was in a lunatic asylum, raving mad”. The police informed the magistrate that Powell’s symptoms were probably temporary, having been induced by the use of opium and charcoal burnt in the defendant’s bedroom. Move to America Powell escaped prosecution by moving to America with his wife and four children, arriving in New York on May 26, 1849, onboard the Silas Richard. Within six months of arriving, Powell had his book The Living Authors of England published. One of the 38 authors featured in the book was Charles Dickens, and he was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (Dombey and Son) on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately fired off a letter to Lewis Gaylord Clark, editor of the New York literary magazine The Knickerbocker, saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the New-York Tribune and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell started proceedings to sue these publications, and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co. to seek written confirmation of Powell’s guilt. Dickens did receive a reply from John Chapman & Co. confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised that this information might have to be produced in court they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court. While all this was in progress, Powell was arrested in New York for passing a forged draft for £250 from John Allan, who was another partner at John Chapman & Co. Owing to a lack of evidence, Powell was released without charge. Editor and newspaperman Although Powell's reputation had been sullied, he still made a successful career of writing and editing newspapers and periodicals, often working for Frank Leslie., Titles that Powell worked on included: Figaro!; The Lantern; The Reveille and Review; Hudson County Democrat; New York Daily News and Frank Leslie's: Illustrated Newspaper; New Family Magazine and Budget of Fun. In 1886/1887, a series of articles written by Powell called Leaves of my Life were published in Frank Leslie's Sunday Magazine. These would be his final works and included a portrait of Powell in Volume 21. Thomas Butler Gunn, illustrator and writer, worked for Powell during the 1850s and wrote about him in his diaries. He believed that Dickens had based the character of Wilkins Micawber on Powell, saying that he resembled him both physically and in his mannerisms. Gunn’s less-than-complimentary description of Powell goes on: > He is very familiar in conversation, and his speech has a sort of orotund > unctuousness of accent which, in conjunction with his implied knowledge of > every-body, might easily gull people into the belief that he was rather a > witty man of the world than otherwise. He is a great mischief-maker and > back-biter, and inherently a dodger. Family Details of Powell’s early life are vague although his death certificate indicates that his father’s first name was also Thomas. In 1836, Powell married Frances (Fannie) Maria Machell, the daughter of Charles and Martha Maria Machell. Their other daughter, Eliza Mary, married the historian Leonhard Schmitz. Powell’s eldest son, William Frances (Frank), joined his father in the newsprint industry as an engraver. He served in the 9th Regiment, New York Infantry during the Civil War, first as a sergeant and then the first lieutenant. Powell’s wife died in 1872, and he died of Bright's disease in 1887 at his daughter’s home in New Jersey.

Its most distinctive feature, Barrow Hill, is the remnant of an extinct volcano that erupted 315 million years ago. The reserve was created in 2005. History The area was once woodland inside Pensnett Chase, which was mainly common land under the lordship of the Barons of Dudley. The hard volcanic rock (dolerite) that forms Barrow Hill was quarried in the 19th century for use as road stone. Another reminder of the industrial age in the reserve is a footpath that follows the course of one of the Earl of Dudley's private railways. The reserve was created in 2005. Location The reserve is located at Pensnett, near to St Marks Church and Russells Hall Hospital. Access is via Vicarage Lane, Pensnett. Landscape The reserve is dominated by Barrow Hill, the remains of an extinct volcano. The effects of quarrying for dolerite can be clearly seen. The quarrying removed the two barrows (Bronze Age burial mounds) that gave the hill its name. Exposed rock faces in the quarries reveal volcanic features, such as hexagonal pillars that formed during the cooling of the magma. The area contains woodland, such as Barrow Hill Copse, along with meadowland and ponds.

It was opened in 1933 and is the last of its kind still in operation in Ireland. The pool is owned and operated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council (Down District Council prior to the local government reform which came into effect on 1 April 2015). History The idea of an outdoor pool in Newcastle was first proposed in 1926 but was rejected by the Newcastle Urban District Council ratepayers because of the high cost of £8,500. However plans for a pool at a cost of £4,000 were approved in 1931, despite strong opposition. In February 1932, construction began at Blackrock and the pool was officially opened on 10 June 1933 by the Council Chairman J.P. Hastings and Lady Elizabeth Annesley. The pool originally had diving boards and a chute. It also hosted annual galas, diving displays and water polo matches. The high diving board and the chute were removed in 1980. Around this time the pool started to focus more on life saving. This helped to increase the number of visitors that had been declining since the 1950s due to the increased popularity of indoor pools and package holidays. The annual gala also changed around this time to include the \\"Cross the Bay Swim\\", later known as The Harbour Swim. Closure The Rock Pool has been threatened with closure on multiple occasions. In February 2015 approximately 2000 people successfully campaigned to stop the council from closing it due to budget cuts. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council stated that its closure would save £45,000 annually. The pool has been temporarily closed in the past due to poor water quality.Down District Council Recreation Committee Meeting , 23 June 2008 References Lidos Swimming venues in the United Kingdom 1933 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Rock Pool (Newcastle)"},{"id":"48708600","text":"Exchange economy is technical term used in microeconomics research to describe interaction between several agents.

Though raised a Sunni, Nassir converted to Shiism, and in the wake of Iran's Islamic revolution publicly identified himself as Twelver Shia.  Early life  Sheikh Abdillahi Nassir was born in Mombasa on 1 June 1932. His early education commenced with Madrasah education as he enrolled in Madrasah at a young age of four years and continued attending Madrasah from 1936 to 1946.  Education  At the same time he had simultaneous normal school education attending the Arab Boys Primary School from 1941–49 and later joined the Zanzibar’s Bet-el-Ras Teacher Training College from 1950-51.  Early career  Upon his return to Mombasa he taught at the Arab Primary School from 1951-54. Because of his health condition, he was medically boarded out. Recovering from his ailment, he then joined the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education as an accounts clerk and as a part-time religious Instructor, from 1955-57. Sheikh Abdillahi Nassir took active interest in pre independence Kenya politics from 1957-63. He was elected to Kenya’s pre-independence Legislative Council and served in this capacity from 1961-63. As a member of the Kenya Legislative Council, he also attended the historic Kenya Constitutional Conference held at the Lancaster House, London, in 1963. From 1964-1965 he worked as an Arabic/Swahili monitor with the BBC in Nairobi. Later he joined the Oxford University Press and worked as a Swahili Editor with the Eastern Africa Branch of Oxford University Press in Nairobi from 1965-73. In 1973, Sheikh Abdillahi left the Oxford University Press to form his own Shungwaya Publishers Ltd. In 1974 he was recalled by the Oxford University Press to head the Eastern Africa Branch as General Manager and served in this capacity from 1974 to 1977. Nassir's positions have included serving as the principal of the Shia Theological Seminary near Mombasa, and his role in the Coastal People's Party. He attended several meetings in lancaster house to liberate Kenyans from the colonial rulers. He later on left politics after independence for not being pleased by politics of that time.  Tabligh  Despite being active in Kenya politics, Sheikh Abdillahi devoted part time in preaching and tabligh activities from 1954 till 1959. During 1960-80 he engaged in translating and commenting on the Holy Qur’an during the holy months of Ramadan while living in Mombasa (1960–64) and later when he settled in Nairobi (1965–80). From 1978-80 he worked as East Africa Representative of the Jeddah based WAMY (World Assembly of Muslim Youths). With his intellectual knack, Sheikh Abdillahi did not blindly follow the widely held common perceptions about the Shia faith. The spirit of inquiry led him to read books written by Shia scholars. At the same time, he interacted with members of the Shia community with a view to understand the Shia faith better. In due course, he showed growing leanings towards the Shia faith and his question/answer sessions on the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation’s radio programs from 1977-80 aroused much interest. Upon his return to Mombasa in the early 1980s, he was a regular lecturer for the Muharram Majalis organized by the Bilal Muslim Mission of Kenya held at the Huseini Imambargah. Among other speakers for the Muharram majalis were Sharif Khitamy, Sharif Badawy, Prof. Bakari of Nairobi University and a number of other Sunni scholars from Mombasa and Lamu. When the Bilal Muslim Mission of Kenya Assembly Hall was formally opened in 1988, Swahili majalis for the months Muharram and additional lecture series were then held at the Bilal Hall. Sheikh Abdillahi would be among the main speakers attracting good crowd. In due course, he declared himself as a practicing Shia Ithna-Asheri. Through the Bilal media section, Sheikh Abdillahi has recorded various talks which have been broadcast in special Radio and TV programs organized by the Bilal Muslim Mission of Kenya. At the same time, Tabligh Section of the Dar es Salaam Jamaat and the Al Itrah Foundation of Dar-es-Salaam also extended similar cooperation to Sheikh Abdillahi. As a result, series of lecture sessions organized in Dar-es-Salaam and Zanzibar were well received. In addition to Tanzania, Community members and organization in India, Pakistan, U.K., USA and Canada and the West Indies invited Sheikh Abdillahi for lecture tours since he was able to deliver lectures in both English and Kiswahili. Sheikh Abdillahi has written/assisted in writing several books and booklets on Kiswahili language, (seven in all) and on Islam, (twenty), some of which have been translated into English and Rwandese.

The rapper is of Ghanaian and English descent. He is the owner of the label IM REALLYDEAD, through which he releases his own music. He began rapping in 2005 under the name Castro Saint, a moniker he kept until 2007. In his first spell in music, Castro made no music videos. He resumed a music career in 2012 under the name CASisDEAD. Since returning to music in 2012 he has worn a mask during all public appearances and videos, this has led to speculation over his true identity and intentions in protecting it.  Musical career  Castro Saint CASisDEAD began rapping under the name of Castro Saint in 2005. During this period he produced, penned, and recorded tracks such as \\"Adolescence\\", \\"C from T\\", and \\"Drugs\\", which he based on his experiences of growing up in the streets of Tottenham and selling drugs. Castro stopped rapping in 2007 to pursue business ventures and run his pharmaceuticals business. During this period he also recorded some songs with East London- based grime crew In Da Hood. A bootleg collection of tracks recorded during this period was distributed on the internet enabling Castro's music output to remain accessible. CASisDEAD In 2012 CASisDEAD returned to music using the name CAS before switching to CASisDEAD approximately 18 months later. CASisDEAD returned with his crew the 'DEAD TEAM'. Since his return in 2012, CASisDEAD has worn a skull mask in all public appearances. The rapper is typically seen in a Dead Team 'Face' hoodie, red beanie, and red vans in his music videos, merchandise, promotional materials, and during his performances In 2016 he adopted two additional silicone face masks to his stage persona. He is first seen wearing the second mask in his fleeting appearance in the \\"Simon\\" music video. His third mask is a Freddy Krueger inspired silicone face & neck prothesis complete with silicone hands. He wears this mask in the \\"501\\" music video. The rapper has described his persona as a symbol of his personal struggles and his disillusionment with the social and political mainstream. The DEAD TEAM is the support network behind CASisDEAD. The principle members of the team are: creative director & in-house producer Cyrus (1MediaGroup); Mason (MasonisDead); Rico (KingRico); video director ICOproductions; DJ Kyzer (SpecialKyz); creative director AfreeCanRAGE; BadgerB2; and music producer WVLEWNTRS. The team are an integral part of his live shows and always accompany him on stage. A key member of the DEAD TEAM, Renea Campbell-Russell (Mello), died aged 26, in June 2015. In an interview with Loud & Quiet magazine, CAS stated that the pain of Mello's death motivates him & the DEAD TEAM to pursue their artistic vision. In honour of Mello's life and legacy CAS and the DEAD TEAM use the hashtag #FOREVERMELLO  Music Release   \\"The Number 23\\" mixtape (2013)  In December 2013, CASisDEAD released \\"The Number 23\\" mixtape which contains the majority of singles he released in 2012 & 2013\\\\. The first music release of his comeback was the rap \\"T.R.O.N.\\" this was shortly followed by \\"Leon Best\\". CASisDEAD continued to release singles with accompanying self-directed videos throughout 2012 and into 2013. He later released these tracks and various remixes as part of the mixtape The Number 23, the mixtape was also thought to contain some material previously intended for the unreleased \\"Commercial\\" album. His lyrical versatility is witnessed in the songs that comprise his \\"23\\" mixtape where he raps across musical styles such as: grime, drum & bass, electro, jazz, soul, and the Bullitt film soundtrack. For the singles included within the \\"23\\" mixtape, CAS has worked with several producers such as: Faze Miyaki (Play); Merky Ace; Nutty ; MssingNo (Drugs Don't Work); Skywlkr (All Hallows’); and JME (Baraka & Cheese Slice remix).  \\"Commercial 2\\" EP (2015)  In September 2015, CAS issued a limited release of the \\"Commercial 2\\" EP, which was sold in cassette tape format via his website. The Commercial 2 EP comprises 6 tracks: 1. Intro, 2. Colours, 3. Tick Tock, 4. Phonecall, 5. Dumb, 6. Outro The synthpop production on Commercial 2 has been heavily influenced by the 1980s musical output of artists Gary Numan and Steve Strange. In Commercial 2, CAS raps emotionally bleak lyrics about his struggles with his narcotic-centred lifestyle. CAS' dark lyrics are juxtaposed against the light catchy electronic production; this juxtaposition reflects the reality of dealing with the dark and light aspects of his everyday life. CASisDEAD stated that he chose to release the EP in limited quantities and on cassette, as he felt that this suited the material and would make listeners appreciate it more, as they would have to work harder to get a copy. As a treat for his fans, he streamed the Commercial 2 EP via \\"Twitch T.V.\\" on November the 13th at 10 pm. There are no plans at present to release a digital version of the mixtape. However, as a measure to stop touts from exploiting his fans CAS provided a further limited release of the Commercial 2 cassettes on 23 December at 12pm via his website.  2016 releases   \\"Simon\\"  CASisDEAD released the single \\"Simon\\" in January 2016 with an accompanying video. The video is directed by CAS and styled as an episode of the current affairs programme Panorama. The track is produced by Skywlkr. The rapper's lyrics are delivered through the perspective of a long time drug user Simon who has lost everything due to his addictions and now \\"drifts between homelessness, prison and the hospital\\". The character of Simon the drug addict has appeared in CASisDEAD's earlier songs. Simon is first mentioned in Castro's 2005 rap \\"Drugs\\" & he then features in CAS's 2012 rap \\"Drugs Don't Work\\".  \\"Before This\\" (LATERxCASisDEAD)  In May 2016, CASisDEAD released the upbeat single \\"Before This\\" with a highly stylised video directed by the rapper set around the domestic theme of grocery shopping & cooking. In the video, the couple's shared domesticity contrasts with the lyrics of the song which focus on a light-hearted dalliance. The track is a collaboration between CAS & Later - a duo comprising London producer Drive Me Home (Dominik Binegger) and Norwegian singer/songwriter Linn Carin Dirdal. The track is laced with an electronic beat reminiscent of 1980s synthpop (a musical style heavily influencing the Commercial 2 EP ).  501 (Hollow & Heston) (Giggs ft. CASisDEAD)  CASisDEAD features on two tracks on Giggs album \\"Landlord\\" released on 5 August 2016. CAS raps on \\"501 Hollow & Heston\\" and also on \\"Lyrical Combat\\". The two rappers first collaborated in November 2015 when Giggs featured on a remix of CASisDEAD's \\"What's my Name?\\" Giggs released \\"501\\" as the second single from his album with a video directed by CASisDEAD featuring the rappers in a car mechanic workshop.  \\"Does It\\" (Tricky ft.CASisDEAD)  CAS features on Tricky's EP \\"Obia\\" released on 30 September 2016: he contributes his lyrics to a reworked version of \\"Does It\\" (the single is originally from Tricky's \\"False Idols\\" album). Tricky released \\"Does It\\" via the Noisey website on 21 September, a week before the release of the Obia EP.  Music videos  CASisDEAD has directed several of his music videos. He has stated in an interview that his songs usually originate from a scenario he first sees in his mind; he then selects a suitable beat and creates a rap to capture his initial vision./ He states that he perceives himself to be, in equal measure, both a visual artist/director and rapper. He is involved in the entire process of making his music videos. CAS starts by developing the video's storyboard; he then proceeds to arrange the practical details of the music video's mise-en-scène - this includes setting the lighting, props, and set design. CAS then directs the music video and he also oversees the final edit. He has directed the music videos for: Cheese Slice; All Hallows; Charlotte; What's My Name?; Simon; Before This; 501 Hollow & Heston; THE XXIII - WEEKEND; The Grid.  Critical reception  Critical reception for CASisDEAD's work has been positive and Loud and Quiet complimented his Commercial 2 EP for being fresh. WordPlay Magazine praised The Number 23 mixtape, stating that they felt that it was \\"in the top 3 UK releases\\" for 2013. The magazine also applauded \\"23\\" for being \\"exceptionally intelligent, great delivery and a mastery of story telling.\\" In May 2015, the English producer The Purist stated in the Passion of the Weiss magazine, \\"I genuinely rate Cas as the best rapper to ever come out of England. Ever. I rate him that highly. I literally can't speak any higher of his talent. To me, he's a combination of Nas, Big L, Mobb Deep, and Dizzee Rascal.\\" In December 2015 Mixmag compared the artist favorably to Mike Skinner, Giggs and Chuckie and stated that he was \\"quite possibly one of the best things to ever happen in British rap music\\". And, in a 2016 radio interview, Dizzee Rascal paid tribute to Cas for being the best lyricist and pristine. In an interview with Global Rockstar Magazine in March 2016, Tricky lauded CASisDEAD for his originality stating, \\"See what Cas does, even if it sold a million records you'd still have to call it underground. Because it's different. And he's not playing by any rules\\".

The earliest contact with the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam and the Pashtun people within modern-day boundaries of Afghanistan, occurred during the lifetime of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. The movement began by Ahmad, was largely seen as apostasy by most other Muslim groups, including by those in Afghanistan, and accordingly only twelve years after Ahmad's claim to be the promised Mahdi, two of the foremost Ahmadi Muslims were stoned to death in Kabul during 1901 to 1903. The killings continued until 1925, when in 1924-1925, under Emir Amanullah Khan, affiliation with Ahmadiyya beliefs became a capital offence and those who converted were forcibly reverted.Vincent Littrell. [Islam: Ahmadiyya]. World Association of International Studies, February 17, 2006 History The history of the movement in Afghanistan begins with the efforts undertaken by two early converts, namely Syed Abdul Latif and Abdur Rahman, later to become the two of the first few people in the history of the movement. Syed Abdul Latif, from Khost Province, was a royal advisor to Abdur Rahman Khan and Habibullah Khan, two of the Emirs of Afghanistan between the late 19th and early 20th century. Latif, along with Sardar Shireendil Khan, the former governor of Khost Province, represented Abdur Rahman Khan during the negotiation of the Durand Line agreement with British India in 1893. In 1901, he became an Ahmadi after reading some of the books of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement. Latif was a member of the religious clergy of Afghanistan. Consequently, he sent one of his foremost followers, Abdur Rahman, to Qadian, India to learn more about the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement. Following a number of dialogues with Ahmad of Qadian, Rahman himself became an Ahmadi. Eager to convey his new found faith, he travelled to Kabul, the seat of the emir of Afghanistan, instead of returning to Latif. There, the religious clerics persuaded the emir to authorize a death sentence for Rahman. Following his arrest, Rahman was strangled to death on June 20, 1901. Syed Abdul Latif sitting on the right of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan In 1902, Latif requested Emir Habibullah Khan for permission to travel for Hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, in modern-day Saudi Arabia. Granting Latif his request, the emir presented him with a cover for his travel expenses. Latif reached Lahore in October 1902 accompanied with some of his students. On arrival, he learnt that the Ottomans, who controlled much of Arabian peninsula, had imposed restrictions on people travelling to Mecca from British India as a consequence of a plague that had spread in the country. Therefore Latif decided to visit Qadian instead, to meet Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. After spending a number of months, he returned to Kabul, publicly announced his allegiance to the Ahmadiyya movement. He had offered his oath of allegiance to Ahmad during his period of stay in Qadian. The emir, on the order of religious clerics, charged him with apostasy which carried the death penalty in Afghanistan. Latif was imprisoned for several weeks before his public execution on July 14, 1903. Unwilling to recant his views, he repeatedly attempted to convince others of the Ahmadiyya interpretations during his period of imprisonment and trial. By the mid 1920s, nine Afghan Ahmadi were killed or stoned to death for their faith, all in Kabul. They were all among the first ten Ahmadis killed for their faith in the history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, with the tenth being Sheikh Ahmad Furqani, who was killed in Baghdad, Iraq in January 1935. By 1925, Afghanistan introduced a criminal code which imposed capital punishment for anyone adopting the Ahmadiyya beliefs. Prophecies Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to have foretold the execution of two of his devout followers based on an Arabic revelation he claimed to have received, twenty years before Latif's death, \\"Two goats will be slaughtered and there is no one on the earth that can avoid death.\\" He interpreted this to mean that two of his followers would be killed and that as a result general destruction would overtake the country in which they were to be killed. Condemning the killing, Ahmad writes in his book The Narrative of Two Martyrdoms: In 1906, Ahmad is believed to have prophesied the martyrdom of another three of his followers, when he claimed to have received the Arabic revelation, \\"Three goats will be slaughtered\\". According to Ahmadi commentators this revelation referred to the 1924-1925 killings of Moulvi Naimatullah Khan, Moulvi Abdul Haleem, and Qari Noor Ali, all leading religious figures among the Ahmadiyya members in Afghanistan. The killings occurred despite the fact that the Ahmadi Muslims congratulated the then emir, Amanullah Khan, in 1922, for granting religious freedom to his people.

It is a 2.4 m (8 foot) long sailing dinghy designed to be built quickly and easily by builders with no previous experience of boatbuilding. A detailed report was published in Watercraft Magazine.  Construction  Firebug dinghy with sub deck structure finished The Firebug is constructed on a rigid jig with 6 timber stringers and a centerline web. The flat bottom is 600 mm wide and is made from 9 mm marine plywood. The sides, bilge panels bulkheads and deck are cut from 2.5 panels of 4 mm marine plywood. The minimum weight of the completed hull is 40 kg (sometimes cited as 27 kg). To highlight the straightforward construction, a Firebug was built live at the 2008 Sydney International Boat Show.  Rig  The deck stepped mast is supported by shrouds and a forestay and rotates on a pin at the step. To allow adults to sail Firebugs comfortably, the design brings the sheet down from the boom in front of the centerboard box allowing greater space for the sailor.  Sailing  Firebugs have 4.5 sq m sail area. This compares with 3.3 for the Optimist junior training dinghy. This 50% greater sail area means that Firebugs are raced by adults as well as graduates from Optimists and other classes. Unusually among modern dinghy designs, the rig is provided with reef points to allow lighter or less experienced sailors to continue to participate, when stronger winds are forecast. A key to the success of the Firebug is its capacity to recover from a capsize and continue racing. This is achieved by the placement of the buoyancy tanks so that water drains out of the cockpit as the boat is righted from a capsize. Despite its small size, the Firebug will easily plane carrying an adult.  Class organisation  Firebug Dinghies sailing at Concord Ryde Sailing Club The class is administered and support is provided to builders from the class's office in Russell, New Zealand. Sails, masts and rigging packages are dispatched to builders across the world.  Reception  The first Firebug was built in 1988. Since then, active fleets have been established in Australia and New Zealand and over 1,000 boats have been built in places as diverse as Malta, Samoa and Georgia on the Black Sea. In Australia, a community group arranged for a group of teenagers who were at risk of leaving school early to build a FireBug for their stand at the 2008 Sydney International Boat Show. The New Zealand Ministry of Education funds schools to build FireBugs for the full cost of the boat, plus an extra 5% to allow for tools.

Biography He was born at Yockleton Hall, Shropshire on 10 June 1895. He was eldest of the three children (all boys) of Robert Theodore Milford, who was headmaster of the local preparatory school, and Elspeth Barter, the granddaughter of George Moberly, Bishop of Salisbury. He attended Clifton College,\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p302: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 where curriculum included instruction in music as well as the customary classical education. When the First World War broke out, he volunteered for the army and was posted to the 19th Royal Fusiliers and then commissioned in the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. He fought in Mesopotamia and had two periods of leave in India. In 1918 he was sent to Cairo to train for the Royal Flying Corps, but in 1919 he was invalided and sent home. In the same year, he went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study literae humaniores. He graduated with a first-class degree in 1921. He had been involved with the Student Christian Movement (SCM) at Oxford, a connection which took him back to India to teach first at Alwaye College, Travancore (1921–23) and then St. John's College, Agra (1923–24). He then returned to England to serve as local SCM secretary in Liverpool between 1924 and 1926. He spent the academical year 1930-31 training for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge. He was made a priest in Lucknow, India, in 1934. He returned to England in 1935 to serve as curate at All Hallows, Lombard Street, London. At the same time, he worked as study secretary for the SCM. He left both positions to become Vicar of St Mary's, the Oxford University church. In this capacity, he founded a philosophical and theological discussion group known as the Colloquy. On 5 October 1942, he met with several other distinguished individuals in the Old Library at St Mary's (at the instigation of the Quaker Dr Henry Gillett) to discuss how to assist victims of the famine in Axis-occupied Greece caused by the Allied naval blockades. This meeting resulted in the foundation of the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (later Oxfam, of which Milford was the first chairman. In 1947, he left his posts at both St Mary's and the Oxford Committee to become canon and chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral, having special responsibility for religious education in the diocese, including Lincoln Theological College. During this time, he wrote his first book, Foolishness to the Greeks (published in 1953), based on his talks for a university mission. In 1958, he became Master of the Temple in London. He found himself in conflict with the benchers on a number of issues, including the prosecution of Penguin Books related to the publication of Lady Chatterley's Lover; Milford appeared in the defence. He was again chairman of the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief from 1960 to 1965. In 1961, his second book The Valley of Decision was published, exploring the moral problems posed by atomic weapons (the book emerged from Milford's participation in a working party of the British Council of Churches). In 1968, he left the Temple and retired to Shaftesbury, where he ran a group studying Teilhard de Chardin, in whom Milford had a great sympatethic interest. In retirement, he wrote a book of verse entitled Belated Harvest (published 1978) and some privately published memoirs. He died on 19 January 1987.Richard Milford on the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, accessed 1 December 2015 Personal life He married Nancy Dickens Bourchier, daughter of the solicitor Ernest Hawksley and great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens, in 1932. They had two daughters. She died in 1936; the following year, he married Margaret Nowell Smith, daughter of Nowell Charles Smith, who had been headmaster of Sherborne School (and who had appointed Milford's father to be a housemaster at the same school in 1911). They had a son who died in infancy, and a further two daughters. His personal interests included chess, music and sailing.

Human resources software is used by businesses to combine a number of necessary HR functions, such as storing employee data, managing payroll, recruitment, benefits administration, time and attendance, employee performance management, and tracking competency and training records. A human resources management system ensures everyday human resources processes are manageable and easy to access. It merges human resources as a discipline and, in particular, its basic HR activities and processes with the information technology field, whereas the programming of data processing systems evolved into standardized routines and packages of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. On the whole, these ERP systems have their origin from software that integrates information from different applications into one universal database. The linkage of its financial and human resource modules through one database is the most important distinction to the individually and proprietarily developed predecessors, which makes this software application both rigid and flexible. Human resource information systems provide a means of acquiring, storing, analyzing and distributing information to various stakeholders. HRIS enable improvement in traditional processes and enhance strategic decision-making. The wave of technological advancement has revolutionized each and every space of life today, and this includes HR. Early systems were narrow in scope, typically focused on a single task, such as improving the payroll process or tracking employees' work hours. Today's systems cover the full spectrum of tasks associated with human resources departments, including tracking and improving process efficiency, managing organizational hierarchy, tracking absence and annual leave, simplifying financial transactions, and providing reports on people data. In short, as the role of human resources departments expanded in complexity, HR technology systems evolved to fit these needs. History The trend of automating payroll and workforce management processes began during the 1970s. Due to limited technology and mainframe computers, companies were still relying on manual entry to conduct employee evaluation and to digitize reporting. The first enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that integrated human resources functions was SAP R/2 (later to be replaced by R/3 and S/4hana), introduced in 1979. This system gave users the possibility to combine corporate data in real time and regulate processes from a single mainframe environment. Many of today's popular HR systems still offer considerable ERP and payroll functionality. The first completely HR-centered client-server system for the enterprise market was PeopleSoft, released in 1987 and later bought by Oracle in 2005. Hosted and updated by clients, PeopleSoft overtook the mainframe environment concept in popularity. Oracle has also developed multiple similar BPM systems to automate corporate operations. Beginning in the late 1990s, HR vendors started offering cloud- hosted HR services to make this technology more accessible to small and remote teams. Instead of a client-server, companies began using online accounts on web-based portals to access their employees' performance. Mobile applications have also become more common. HRIS and HRMS technologies have allowed HR professionals to shy away from their traditional administrative work and have inserted them as strategic assets to the company. For example, these roles include employee development, as well as analyzing the workforce to target talent-rich areas. Functions The function of human resources departments is administrative and common to all organizations. Organizations may have formalized selection, evaluation, and payroll processes. Management of \\"human capital\\" has progressed to an imperative and complex process. The HR function consists of tracking existing employee data, which traditionally includes personal histories, skills, capabilities, accomplishments, and salary. To reduce the manual workload of these administrative activities, organizations began to electronically automate many of these processes by introducing specialized human resource management systems. HR executives rely on internal or external IT professionals to develop and maintain an integrated HRMS. Before client–server architectures evolved in the late 1980s, many HR automation processes were relegated to mainframe computers that could handle large amounts of data transactions. In consequence of the high capital investment necessary to buy or program proprietary software, these internally developed HRMS were limited to organizations that possessed a large amount of capital. The advent of client-server, application service provider, and software as a service (SaaS) or human resource management systems enabled higher administrative control of such systems. Currently, human resource management systems tend to encompass: # Retaining staff #Hiring # Onboarding & Offboarding #Administration # Managing payroll # Tracking and Managing employee benefits # HR planning # Recruiting/Learning management #Performance management and appraisals #Employee self-service # Scheduling and rota management # Absence management #Leave management # Reporting and analytics # Employee reassignment # Grievance handling by following precedents The payroll module automates the pay process by gathering data on employee time and attendance, calculating various deductions and taxes, and generating periodic pay cheques and employee tax reports. Data is generally fed from human resources and timekeeping modules to calculate automatic deposit and manual cheque writing capabilities. This module can encompass all employee-related transactions as well as integrate with existing financial management systems. The time and attendance module gathers standardized time and work related efforts. The most advanced modules provide broad flexibility in data collection methods, labor distribution capabilities and data analysis features. Cost analysis and efficiency metrics are the primary functions. The benefits administration module provides a system for organizations to administer and track employee participation in benefits programs. These typically encompass insurance, compensation, profit sharing, and retirement. The HR management module is a component covering many other HR aspects from application to retirement. The system records basic demographic and address data, selection, training and development, capabilities and skills management, compensation planning records and other related activities. Leading edge systems provide the ability to \\"read\\" applications and enter relevant data to applicable database fields, notify employers and provide position management and position control. Human resource management function involves the recruitment, placement, evaluation, compensation, and development of the employees of an organization. Initially, businesses used computer-based information systems to: * produce paychecks and payroll reports; * maintain personnel records; * pursue talent management. Online recruiting has become one of the primary methods employed by HR departments to garner potential candidates for available positions within an organization. Talent management systems, or recruitment modules, offer an integrated hiring solution for HRMS which typically encompass: * analyzing personnel usage within an organization; * identifying potential applicants; * recruiting through company-facing listings; * recruiting through online recruiting sites or publications that market to both recruiters and applicants; * analytics within the hiring process (time to hire, source of hire, turnover); * compliance management to ensure job ads and candidate onboarding follows government regulations. The significant cost incurred in maintaining an organized recruitment effort, cross-posting within and across general or industry-specific job boards and maintaining a competitive exposure of availabilities has given rise to the development of a dedicated applicant tracking system (ATS) module. The training module provides a system for organizations to administer and track employee training and development efforts. The system, normally called a \\"learning management system\\" (LMS) if a standalone product, allows HR to track education, qualifications, and skills of the employees, as well as outlining what training courses, books, CDs, web-based learning or materials are available to develop which skills. Courses can then be offered in date specific sessions, with delegates and training resources being mapped and managed within the same system. Sophisticated LMSs allow managers to approve training, budgets, and calendars alongside performance management and appraisal metrics. The employee self-service module allows employees to query HR related data and perform some HR transactions over the system. Employees may query their attendance record from the system without asking the information from HR personnel. The module also lets supervisors approve O.T. requests from their subordinates through the system without overloading the task on HR department. Many organizations have gone beyond the traditional functions and developed human resource management information systems, which support recruitment, selection, hiring, job placement, performance appraisals, employee benefit analysis, health, safety, and security, while others integrate an outsourced applicant tracking system that encompasses a subset of the above. The analytics module enables organizations to extend the value of an HRMS implementation by extracting HR related data for use with other business intelligence platforms. For example, organizations combine HR metrics with other business data to identify trends and anomalies in headcount in order to better predict the impact of employee turnover on future output. There are now many types of HRMS or HRIS, some of which are typically local- machine-based software packages; the other main type is an online cloud-based system that can be accessed via a web browser. The staff training module enables organizations the ability to enter, track and manage employee and staff training. Each type of activity can be recorded together with the additional data. The performance of each employee or staff member is then stored and can be accessed via the Analytics module. Employee re-assign module is a recent additional functionality of HRMS. This module has the functions of transfer, promotion, pay revision, re-designation, deputation, confirmation, pay mode change and letter form. Employee self-service Employee self- service (ESS) provides employees access to their personal records and details. ESS features include allowing employees to change their contact details, banking information, and benefits. ESS also allows for administrative tasks such as applying for leave, seeing absence history, reviewing timesheets and tasks, inquiring about available loan programs, requesting overtime payment, viewing compensation history, and submitting reimbursement slips. With the emergence of ESS, employees are able to transact with their Human Resources office remotely. With ESS features, employees can take more responsibility for their present job, skill development, and career planning. As part of HRIS, feedback is given for skill profiles, training and learning, objective setting, appraisals and reporting/analytics. These systems are especially useful for businesses with remote workers, where employees are highly mobile, have flexible working, or not collocated with their manager.

In the 1920s and 1930s, she was active in the Anarcho-Syndicalism movement in Germany and Spain. Raised in Vienna, she moved in 1905 to Berlin, where she became a literary critic, translator, novelist and biographer. In 1932, as the Nazis rose to power, she moved to Barcelona, where she joined the anarchist-feminist group Mujeres Libres, (Free Women), becoming a writer and educator for the movement. In 1938, toward the end of the Spanish Civil War, she fled to France. There, hunted by the Gestapo as a Jew and a supporter of the French Resistance, she survived World War II in hiding. In Germany, she published 23 books, among them translations from the Danish, Russian, Bengali, Ancient Greek, Yiddish and English. She also published two books while living in Spain. The story of Etta Federn and her two sons inspired the 1948 play Skuggan av Mart (Marty's Shadow), by the important Swedish writer Stig Dagerman, who published novels, plays and journalism before committing suicide at age 31. The play based on Federn was first performed at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, and has since played in several countries, including Ireland, the Netherlands, Cyprus and France. Marty's Shadow was first performed in the U.S. in 2017, by the August Strindberg Repertory Theatre in New York City.  Personal life  Raised in an assimilated Jewish family in Vienna, Etta Federn was the daughter of suffragist Ernestine (Spitzer) and Dr. Salomon Federn, a prominent physician and pioneer in the monitoring of blood pressure. Her brother Paul Federn, a psychoanalyst, was an early follower and associate of Sigmund Freud. An expert on ego psychology and the treatment of psychosis, he served as vice president of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Her brother Walther Federn was an important economic journalist in Austria before Hitler came to power. Her brother Karl Federn was a lawyer who, after fleeing to the UK, became known for his anti-Marxist writings. Her sister Else Federn was a social worker in Vienna, active in the Settlement Movement. A park in Vienna was named for her in 2013. Etta Federn's first husband was Max Bruno Kirmsse, a German teacher of children with mental disabilities. Her second husband was Peter Paul Kohlhaas, an illustrator. She had two sons, Hans and Michael, one from each marriage. Her older son, known as Capitaine Jean in the French Resistance, was murdered by French collaborators in 1944.  Career  In Vienna and Berlin, Etta Federn studied literary history, German philology and Ancient Greek. She worked in many genres, publishing articles, biographies, literary studies and poetry. She also wrote a novel that remained unpublished. The Image of Woman by Etta Federn, 1917As a journalist, she was a literary critic for the Berliner Tageblatt. She wrote biographies of Dante Alighieri and Christiane Vulpius (wife of Johann von Goethe). In 1927, she published a biography of Walther Rathenau, the liberal Jewish Foreign Minister of Germany, who had been assassinated in 1922 by anti-Semitic right-wing terrorists. Her biography was reviewed by Gabriele Reuter for the New York Times, which called Federn's account \\"amazingly lucid and precise\\" and said it \\"gives a beautifully clear idea of [Rathenau's] life.\\" Following the book’s publication, Federn became the target of Nazi death threats. During the 1920s, Federn became part of a circle of anarchists, including Rudolf Rocker, Mollie Steimer, Senya Fleshin, Emma Goldman, and Milly Witkop Rocker, who would become her close friend. She contributed to various anarchist newspapers and journals related to the Free Workers' Union of Germany. In Berlin, Federn also met several Polish-born Jewish poets who wrote in Yiddish. In 1931, her translation of the Yiddish poetry collection Fischerdorf (Fishing Village) by Abraham Nahum Stencl was reviewed favorably by Thomas Mann, who admired Stencl's \\"passionate poetic emotion.\\" (The work would be destroyed in the Nazi book burnings). In 1932, Federn left Berlin, realizing that under the Nazis she would no longer be able to publish her writing. She moved with her sons to Barcelona, Spain, where she joined the anarchist movement Mujeres Libres (Free Women), which provided such services as maternity centers, daycare centers, and literacy training to women. She learned Spanish and became director of four progressive schools in the city of Blanes, educating both teachers and children in secular values and antimilitarism. Starting in 1936, she also published a number of articles in the movement's women-run magazine, also called Mujeres Libres. Like many anarchist women, she believed in the importance of literacy for women, in birth control and sexual freedom, and in the power of educated women to be good mothers. She wrote: \\"Educated mothers relate their own experiences and sufferings to their children; they intuitively understand their feelings and expressions. They are good educators, as they are also friends of the children they educate.\\" In 1938, as Francisco Franco's fascists bombed Barcelona and defeated the left, Federn fled to France, where she was held in internment camps as a foreign refugee. She spent the war in hiding in Lyon, at times in a monastery, and did translation work for the French Resistance. She spent her final years in Paris, supported in part by her relatives in the USA. Because her son was killed as a Resistance fighter, she was awarded French citizenship.

The village was developed in the early-to-mid 19th century, and has retained the character of that period better than many small communities in the state. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The area that is now Grafton was first chartered in 1754, but only began to see permanent settlement in the late 1770s, in the town's Middletown section. Grafton Village developed around the confluence of two branches of the Saxtons River, a tributary of the Connecticut River. The first house, a brick structure built about 1795 by Enos Lovell, still stands in the village, and was followed by mills and mill dams on the two rivers, of which only traces now survive. The network of major roads radiating from this area began to take shape then as well. Early development was focused in the area around Kidder Hill Road, while in the second quarter of the 19th century the village center gradually migrated northward, anchored by the construction of the Congregational Church in 1834 and the relocation of its post office in 1841 into what is now the town hall. Grafton's building and economic good times ended about 1870, with little new development taking place until the 20th century, when tourism provided a significant boost to the economy. This boost was accompanied by a strong preservationist drive, resulting in the maintenance of the village's 19th century character. The historic district encompasses essentially the entire developed area of Grafton village. Its rough southern and northeastern boundaries are the two branches of the Saxtons River, extending east of the north branch along Chester Road and Route 121 East, and extending a short way westward along Houghtonville, Middletown, and Hinckley Brook Roads. Many of the buildings in the village are Federal and Greek Revival in character, or are in 20th-century revival styles that are sympathetic. Most are wood frame structures between 1 and three stories in height, although there are a variety of brick buildings as well. A number of buildings have Italianate and later Victorian style. Very few of the historic buildings have been altered in unsympathetic ways, such as the application of synthetic siding or the installation of vinyl windows. The streetscape is also devoid of significant modern intrusions such as utility poles. Six properties in the district are individually listed on the National Register. The Kidder Covered Bridge is the town's only surviving covered bridge, and the Butterfield House (now the library) and the Milldean and Alexander-Davis House are two architecturally significant houses. The Grafton Congregational Church and Chapel, former Grafton Post Office, and Grafton District Schoolhouse No. 2, are all significant for their civic history as well as architecture.

It is part of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex of the Central Volcanic Zone in the Andes. 50 volcanoes active in recent times are found in the Central Volcanic Zone, and several major caldera complexes are situated in the area. The caldera is located in a logistically difficult area of the Andes. Panizos and the majority of these volcanoes are formed by the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is located east of the main arc and is supplied chiefly by dacite magmas. Beneath Panizos lie Tertiary ignimbrites and a Paleozoic sedimentary basement. The huge Panizos ignimbrite erupted by Cerro Panizos has a minimum volume of . It erupted during an event 6.71 ± 0.04 mya and was preceded by another ignimbrite 7.9 mya ago. The last activity is a lava flow 6.1 mya ago. The caldera is hidden beneath a shield with a diameter of and some of its central summits are over high. It has been referred to as an \\"ignimbrite shield\\".  Geography and structure  The centre is located on the border between Argentina and Bolivia. It is a shield constructed from ignimbrites. Research in this region of the Andes is made difficult by physical and logistics issues. Cerro Guacha and La Pacana are among the few systems that were the subject of research. The Panizos ignimbrite is well exposed with little modification. Cerro Panizos is part of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the Andes, a belt of recent volcanism that runs from southern Peru into Chile and Argentina. 50 volcanoes in the belt have been identified as active in recent times. A major ignimbrite province called the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex is associated with the area between 21° and 24° degrees southern latitude since 23 million years ago. Cerro Guacha, La Pacana and Pastos Grandes are calderas within this province which covers a surface of , with geothermal manifestations in El Tatio and Sol de Manana being the latest manifestations of volcanism in the area. A group of lava domes with a diameter of of dacitic composition forms the centre of the complex, with the domes having formed either during one single eruption or several. These domes form a ring structure with thin lava cover in its centre, which may be the rim of a collapse caldera formed in the later stages of the main Panizos eruption and filled by later eruption stages, as suggested by the outward dip of the lower unit of the Panizos Ignimbrite. This caldera has a diameter of . The centre is surrounded a shield with a diameter of . It is constructed from ignimbrites with a slope of 1–3°. Three lava platforms with the names Cerro Chinchinjaran, Cerro Tucunquis and Cerro Anta Quevas are present. The first and the last are part of a dacitic flowfield that includes a long lava flow on its northern sector with some resemblance to pahoehoe lava. A pre-caldera lava structure in the south of the complex is known as Cerro Limitayoc, but it erupted lavas even after the Panizos ignimbrite was erupted. A depression is located just south of the lava dome group and may be a downsag caldera, likewise infilled by activity. The Panizos complex covers an area of and has a total volume of . The structure of the Panizos complex has been called an \\"ignimbrite shield\\". The central summits Limitayoc, Panizos, La Ramada and Vicuñahuasi are over high.  Geology  The volcanism in the area is triggered by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate; magmas formed from the subduction process trigger the melting of the crust. The large calderas are located east of the main volcanic arc of the Central Volcanic Zone, Panizos being east of the main arc. Volcanism in the area is heavily dominated by calderic silicic volcanics with volumes of contrasting to less than andesites. The volcano is part of the so- called Tin belt, a territory in the Andes where large tin mineral deposits are found in granitic and extrusive rocks, formed from sulfidation reactions involving the numerous volcanoes in the area. Magmas in the territory are derived from crystal fractionation and were heavily modified by interactions with the crust that reaches a thickness of beneath the Central Volcanic Zone. Research by S. L. de Silva indicates that before 10 mya volcanic activity already existed north of 20°30' in form of the Oxaya and Altos de Pica ignimbrites. Changes in the subduction activity 12-10 mya caused a shortening and thickening of the crust in the central Andes and the formation of melt zones in the deeper crust, associated with the Quechua phase of Andean orogeny. Since 10.6 mya these rose to the surface, forming magma chambers and calderas. The eruptions of the Panizos ignimbrites coincide with major pulses in APVC activity.  Local  The basement beneath Panizos is formed from two formations, Acoite and Peña Colorada. The former is a sedimentary layer, formed during arc development in the Paleozoic. The latter is Tertiary volcanic in origin, containing breccia, debris flow material, ignimbrites, lava flows and sandstone. The basement dips westward. Based on neodymium isotope ratios, some of the basement rocks are about one billion years old. The volcano is part of a group with other volcanoes of the Lipez region. In this region, arc and back-arc volcanism occur in the same area and have generated some of the largest calderas in the world. These include Cerro Guacha, Pastos Grandes and Vilama. A meridional lineament of volcanoes including Limitayoc and Salle extends from the southern and western margin of the central lava domes to Cerro Pululu in the south. Another lineament may form the eastern rim of the lava dome complex. Other centres in the south are the Rose, Salle and West Zapaleri ignimbrites as well as the dacites of Cerro Bayo, all erupted 8.9–5.1 mya from the Vilama caldera. Cerro Panizos is associated with a large-scale topographic anomaly, similar to many other volcanic centres in the region.  Geologic record  According to Turner (1978), the ignimbrites are part of the Lipiyoc formation and the lava dome structures of the Vicuñahuasi formation. The Panizos eruption products display strong local variations, with features at different depths and different distances from the central dome complex being very dissimilar. The Cerro Corutu centre southwest of Panizos was active in the Miocene, forming an ignimbrite layer, whose exposure in the Quebrada Queñoal valley is thick. It contains biotite, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and smaller amounts of quartz. Another tuff is found in Quebrada Cusi Cusi. Above these lies an eastward sloping layer of volcaniclastic material. The area covered by the Panizos products had been subject to earlier eruptive activity from unknown centres between 15.4–13.4 mya, generating tuffs recognized in the San Pablo de Lípez region as outcrops. Changes in the subduction geometry since the late Miocene have caused volcanism to diminish from east to west, including cessation of activity at the Panizos centre. Uturuncu volcano was last active 271,000 years ago and the Cerro Chascon-Runtu Jarita complex 85,000 years ago.  Composition  With the exception of some andesitic products, mostly lava flows, dacite is the main component of Panizos eruptive products. The rock matrix and clasts in the rock have similar minerals. Plagioclase is the main component of the lower cooling unit. Vesicles are rare in the Panizos ignimbrite, forming no more than 25%. Calling it \\"densely welded\\" is difficult at percentages of more than 10%. Pumice is also found, chemically it contains biotite, plagioclase, quartz and some orthopyroxene. In the lower units, tonalite and ilmenite are also found. The Cienago and Cusi Cusi ignimbrites both contain biotite, quartz, plagioclase and Cusi Cusi also sanidine. The ignimbrites of Panizos are alumina- and potassium-rich and contain 61–66% SiO2. The Cienago ignimbrite has by one study the largest amount of SiO2 of all magmas of Panizos, whereas another indicates that the Cusi Cusi ignimbrite has the highest with 69%. The Cienago ignimbrites would have 63–65% and the Panizos ones 61–66%. Isotope analysis indicates high / ratios and high / and / ratios. These are associated with arc volcanism, unlike the much lower ratios found at Galan which are typical for intraplate volcanism. Along with the neodymium isotope ratios this suggests that Panizos magmas have a strong crustal component. Lead isotope ratios are comparable with these of Galan and La Pacana and are linked to the domain of the crust they are constructed on. There are some compositional variations in various stages of volcanism at Cerro Panizos. The Cienago ignimbrite is a highly evolved magma. Magmas from the Panizos ignimbrite display only weak variations that may be linked to temperature differences in the magma chamber. The magmas of the Panizos ignimbrite underwent strong crystallization between eruptions and crystals are often heavily modified. The formation of all magmas was initiated by the interaction of mafic mantle melts with the crust. The mantle component is up to 50% of the main Panizos ignimbrite. A notable feature of Cerro Panizos is the presence of so-called orbs, which are rocks with concentric layers of igneous material surrounding them. They are known from plutonic rocks, but orbs in erupted magmas are only known from Akagi volcano, Japan. In Panizos they are found in the upper part of the lower cooling unit of the Cerro Panizos ignimbrite and are associated with pumice and megacrysts in the surrounding rock. Buried within the ignimbrites and lavas, some orbs contain layers of biotite, bronzite, ilmenite and plagioclase around a centimetre- sized xenolith or orthopyroxene core. The layering is not disturbed by irregular shapes of the cores. These orbs most likely formed from material crystallizing around pre-existent cores during rapid changes in magma temperature that occurred shortly before the end of the first phase of the Cerro Panizos eruption through changes in magma water content. Opening of ring vents then delivered the orb-containing magma to the surface.  Climate and hydrography  Panizos has an arid climate, although some stream erosion is visible. Some stream valleys are known, clockwise from northeast, as Quebrada Buenos Aires, Quebrada Cienago, Quebrada Paicone Quebrada Pupusayo, Quebrada Cusi Cusi, Quebrada Cuevas and Quebrada Garcia. The dissection is particularly pronounced on the Argentine side of the complex. Oxygen isotopic analysis of magmas from other APVC centres support the notion that the area of the APVC has been subject to arid climate for the duration of its active phase.  Eruptive history  Two ignimbrite eruptions have taken place in Panizos. A number of lava flows also formed. Volcanic activity took place in the Late Miocene. The main Cerro Panizos ignimbrite lies on top three older ignimbrite layers. Potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 9.7 ± 0.4, 8.49 ± 0.2 and 9.4 mya. Dates often differ between newly established and old established dates, presumably due to xenolith contamination. The Cusi Cusi tuff is 12.4 mya old or more than 10 million years old and has been associated with the Panizos centre. The first recorded ignimbrite in the area is named Quebrada Cienago ignimbrite after the valley where it is exposed. It contains biotite quartz dacite and is formed from four units, two ashfall deposits and two ignimbrite flows. Some of these have undergone reworking. It was emplaced 7.9 mya. After the emplacement of the Cienago ignimbrite, eruption of dacite lava flows continued. Erupted 6.71 ± 0.04 mya, the Panizos ignimbrite proper is a complex structure with several cooling units and an interlayered pyroclastic deposit, which contains pumice, sandstone boulders up to two metres thick and has carved channels into the lower unit. At the edge of the plateau the upper and lower cooling units are and thick. In the plateau centre, the lower unit is completely hidden beneath the now more than thick upper unit. The lower unit begins with one metre of lapilli and above it thick ignimbrite layers that become increasingly non-welded farther up with vapour phase components appearing. There was no prior Plinian fallout. Orbs and two differently coloured pumices are located in the upper section of the lower unit, with some xenoliths. The upper cooling unit contains two types of pumice, one strongly welded and the other weakly so, and is much richer in lithic fragments. The upper unit was erupted in several discrete flows from the central complex. Some pumice fall layers are embedded in the upper unit. Based on the structure, the main Panizos ignimbrite was probably erupted in a steady eruption at first, from either one vent or several smaller ones in close association. Either a column collapse or a change in vent geometries triggered a temporary pause which separates the upper and lower cooling units. After a short timespan, the eruption restarted, this time through several eruption flows and a more unsteady regimen with a lower flow rate. Based on welding patterns, the eruption commenced in the southern sector later covered by lava domes and migrated northward. Calculations indicate that the main Panizos ignimbrite has minimum volumina of outside of the calderas and dense rock equivalent. This ignimbrite flow was of comparatively low fluidity, likely due to its high crystal content. The amount of vesicles present in the lower cooling unit is inferior to 20% of volume. Above the Panizos ignimbrite, a lava flow platform and a set of lava domes were emplaced. A last manifestation is the Cerro La Ramada lava flow, with an age of 6.1 mya. A tephra layer found in the Coastal Cordillera and dated 6.66 ± 0.13 mya may also be linked to the Panizos complex. The much younger (1.9±0.2–1.7±0.5 mya) Laguna Colorada ignimbrite is sometimes called Panizos, generating confusion.

In 1896, the Klamath Republican was a four-page newspaper, with pages measuring 18 inches by 24 inches. The Republican’s format was a seven-column folio. An annual subscription to the Republican cost $2 in 1897. In 1896 the editors and publishers were Bowdoin and Loosley. The newspaper, as its name shows, was a proponent of the Republican Party. The final publication was volume 18, number 49, published on March 13, 1914. The Klamath Republican had a successor newspaper, the Semi-Weekly Herald, which began publication on March 16, 1914, with volume 18, issue number 50. The Republican was established by W.E. Bowdoin, who had previously published the Klamath County Star, and whose father, J.A. Bowdoin, had also been in the newspaper business. In 1897, Bowdoin took on a partner, Milan A. Loosley, who, in July 1898, became the sole publisher. In June 1899, Loosley sold the newspaper, and for a brief time it was published by the Republican Publishing Company, of which Charles J. Roberts was the manager. On September 21, 1899, W.H. Huse & Son, from Ponca, Nebraska, bought the Republican. They made additions to the plant and improvements to the newspaper. Wesley O.

Description and history The Grout House stands at the northwest corner of Bonnyvale Road and Western Avenue (Vermont Route 9), on a generous lot in the village of West Brattleboro. It is a 1-3/4 story wood frame structure, with a steeply pitched cross-gable roof that shelters a full second floor and a smaller attic. The front facade, facing Western Avenue, is five bays wide on the ground floor, three on the second, and one on the third. A single-story porch extends across the center three bays, supported by cruciform posts, and sporting stickwork balustrades at the ground floor and around the roof. Windows on the upper levels have elongated pyramidal hood decorations, roughly matching in angle the roof pitch. There is Stick style decorate woodwork at the gable peaks. The house was built about 1880 for Rev.

Retzawl is surrounded by villages like Jatinga, on the east; Doiheng on the south; Jatinga Lampu on the west and Inchaikang on the north. Retzawl village is believed to be established in the 1780s. Its name is the word in a native language of the Hmars, meaning a plain where rubber trees grow naturally. Later many of the villagers decided to shift the village downhill in order to develop paddy fields. They had abandoned their original habitation/village which has now come to be called \\"Retzawl Khuoruo\\" or \\"Khuo- Malui\\" (abandoned Retzawl Village or former village, respectively) and settled down in three places namely, in the local dialect, \\"Sekhnuoipha\\" (formation of the land resembles with hammer); \\"Phai\\" (plain) and \\"phailammuol\\" (hills along the way towards the plain). These places are situated at 3 to 4 km away from the original village in a triangular manner (i.e. Sekhnuoipha, in the east; Phailammuol, in the west and Phai, in the north) and the distance between them maybe approximately 2 km each. At about this time a modern agricultural system began to be introduced at Retzawl in the places mentioned above, and the villagers had to settle there to take advantage of a composite scheme of government grants promoting the new system. The official name of the village remained the same since all three fall within the municipal boundaries of Retzawl Village. After some years, those settled in the Phai had shifted to Phailammuol and later on to Sekhnuoipha. \\"Sekhnuoipha\\" has now calls as \\"Upper Retzawl\\" and \\"Phailammuol\\" as \\"Lower Retzawl\\".

The mission of Ireland's Great Hunger Museum at Quinnipiac University is to collect, preserve, exhibit and study its collection of art, artifacts and literature related to the Irish Famine/Great Hunger that occurred from 1845–52. In doing so, it seeks to educate audiences of all ages about the underlying political, social, economic and historic causes of the Great Hunger, and the magnitude of the disaster on Ireland and its people. The museum contains the world's largest collection of Great Hunger-related art by noted contemporary Irish and Irish American artists as well as a number of period paintings by some of Ireland's most important 19th-century artists. Ireland's Great Hunger Museum preserves, builds and presents its art collection to stimulate reflection, inspire imagination and advance awareness of Ireland's Great Hunger and its long aftermath on both sides of the Atlantic. Works by noted contemporary Irish artists are featured in the museum's permanent collection including internationally known sculptors John Behan, Rowan Gillespie and Éamonn O'Doherty; as well as contemporary visual artists, Robert Ballagh, Alanna O'Kelly, Brian Maguire and Hughie O'Donoghue.

In a Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika in the modern era, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at serial number 50. The Upanishad is not part of the anthology of 52 popular Upanishads in north India by Colebrooke, nor is it found in the Bibliotheca Indica anthology of popular Upanishads in south India by Narayana. It is one of the 13 Shaiva Upanishads. The Upanishad eulogizes Lord Shiva as the second Lord of the world (the first being at Maha Vishnu) who incarnates as Sharabha – a human-lion-bird version, to confront the human-lion Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, when Narasimha becomes destructive. But even he fails and the only one that stopped narasimha was prahalada with love and affection. The text is also called as the \\"Pippaladadharmasastra,\\" as an exposition of the knowledge by Lord Brahma to sage Pippalada. Its title is also spelled as Sarabha Upanishad or Sharabhopanishad. Contents The Upanishad, after an initial prayer offering to Indra, Garuda, and Brihaspati seeking prosperity and peace to all, extols Lord Shiva or Mahesvara, in the first two verses as original God, creator of Brahma, Vishnu and other divinities, as governs the world, as the chief architect of the Vedas who conveyed it to Brahma, who dismantled the universe at the great flood, and was the Lord of Lords. In the third verse of the Upanishad the narration is of Shiva incarnating as Sarabha, in the form of a fierce anthropomorphic combination of eagle, lion, and man. Sarabha slays Narasimha, an incarnation of Vishnu, because he was causing destruction in the world. According to the Puranas, Sarabha was one of Shiva's sixty four avatars (forms), to assist the heavenly devas and the human beings. In the fourth verse, the Upanishad states that after killing Narasimha with his claws, Sarabha wore its hide as his attire and came to be called Veera Bhadra. In the fifth verse Sarabha cuts the fifth head of Brahma, and in the sixth verse He fells Kala (time), the God of death, with his feet. He consumes Halahala, the poison that was created along with Amrita (nectar of immortality), during cosmic creation through the churning of the ocean. In the seventh verse, Shiva, pleased with the veneration of Vishnu, gifts him with the Chakra (holy wheel) – the iconography commonly found in one of the hands of Vishnu murtis. In the last three verses, the Upanishad assures the efficacy of Shiva to burn all sins away if they are caused and perpetuated by others. Maheshwara's incarnation as Sarabha signifies Paramatman, combining all facets of body, mind and jeeva. Narration of the Upanishad, states the text, gives Moksha or salvation.
