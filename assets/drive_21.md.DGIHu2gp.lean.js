Biography =Early life and photographic training= Rosemary Gilliat was raised by her father on his tea plantation in Ceylon. She was educated in Geneva, Switzerland under the supervision of her grandmother and later, at age 16, in Germany. Although she had an interest in photography since receiving her first camera, a Brownie, at age 8, it was while in Germany, in 1936‚Äì1937, that she secured her first work as a photographer, selling her images for book illustrations. In 1938, she moved to London, England to live with her brother and was able to secure further photographic work, supplying images for various press agencies until being sent out of the city due to bombing in 1940. After the Second World War, she continued working as a photographer in London and further developed her skills, with training in fashion and commercial photography from English photographer Bill Brandt. Her work appeared in magazines such as the Sunday Observer, and provided illustrations for history and architectural books. In 1952, Gilliat emigrated to Canada and settled in Ottawa. In 1963, she married Mike Eaton, a hydrographer, and they moved to Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia in 1965. =Photographic career in Canada= James Houston preparing a mount for an Inuit print, in Cape Dorset, photographed by Rosemary Gilliat Eaton, 1960. Gilliat worked primarily as a freelance photographer, between the years 1953 and 1964. Her first assignment that required her to leave Ottawa was for the Husdon's Bay Company's magazine The Beaver, for which she travelled to Dawson City, Yukon in 1953. During her career she also put photo stories together for Weekend magazine, Star Weekly (a photo insert for the Toronto Star), Canadian Geographic and Macleans, and also completed assignments for several government departments, including the Department of Northern Affairs and the National Film Board of Canada's Still Photography Division. She documented such topics and locations as: James Houston and the Eskimo Art Co-op; modern Inuit life; Trans Canada Highway; the St. Lawrence Seaway (1954); Seagrams; Neuch√¢tel Junior College (1956); and the Calgary Stampede. Gilliat's photographic career was curtailed by ill-health in 1963, when she developed a problem with her inner-ear. Her archive of professional and personal work was acquired by Library and Archives Canada in 2008. References Bibliography * Monk, Lorraine. The Female Eye / Coup d'oeil feminine.

Early life and career  Charles DuBack was born on March 10, 1926 to Czechoslovakian parents Charles and Cecilia DuBack in Fairfield, Connecticut. He was the eldest of ten children. His father worked as a baker, and DuBack assisted in the bakery as a teenager. After high school, Charles DuBack volunteered with the U.S.Navy from 1944‚Äì46, during World War II, where he served in the Amphibious Force through 3 invasions in the Pacific Theatre.Larsen, Susan C., Oral history interview with Charles Duback, 2004 December 15-2005 May 18. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. On the G.I. Bill, DuBack attended the Whitney School of Fine Art in New Haven, Connecticut, and the Newark School of Fine Arts in Newark, New Jersey, and the Brooklyn Museum Art School, in Brooklyn, NY. He attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine for five summers beginning in 1950, where he met fellow artists and friends Bernard ‚ÄúBlackie‚Äù Langlais, Lois Dodd and Alex Katz, as well as Daphne Mumford (b.1934) whom would later become his wife in 1953. Skowhegan is where his affection for Maine began. As young artists in the early 1950s, DuBack and Mumford lived in Manhattan, sharing a studio building at 212 W 28th street on the first floor, above a working lumber yard, with Bernard Langlais (3rd floor) and Alex Katz (2nd floor). Together, with friends Tom Boutis, Joe Fiore, Ed Moses, Bernard Langlais, Paul Yakovenko, Norman Kanter, and John Ireland Colins, they founded Area Gallery in 1958 on East 10th street ‚Äî part of the artist-run co-operative 10th Street galleries. Area Gallery closed in 1965. In 1972 DuBack co-founded Landmark Gallery at 469 Broome Street in SoHo, with artists Sideo Fromboluti, Jean Cohen, Nora Speyer, Tom Boutis, and Daphne Mumford however Landmark Gallery closed in 1982. Like many artists who developed ties to the Maine coast, Charles DuBack and Daphne Mumford purchased a summer home in North Waldoboro, Maine, in 1954, then in Tenants Harbor, Maine, in 1965. DuBack ultimately left New York City in 1990 to work in his home / studio in Tenants Harbor, on the Saint George River, until his death on October 22, 2015 at the age of 89. DuBack had two daughters with Mumford: Amanda (b.1954), and Cora (b.1956), both of whom were featured in many of his earlier figurative paintings.  Work  Charles DuBack's stylistic progression ranged from color fields to portraits, landscape, and finally to ‚Äúnotational‚Äù abstractions. He asserted throughout his career that he was a Realist, as ‚ÄúAll of my work comes directly from nature.‚ÄùLarsen, Susan C. DuBack's Odyssey Review: Introduction, exhibition catalogue, June 14 - July 20, 2003, Center for Maine Contemporary Art, Rockport, Maine. Many of DuBack's early paintings were large-scale landscapes and figurative, group portraits of family or friends. For example, Happy New Year, 1961, in the permanent collection of Colby College,* features Bernard and Helen Langlais, John Grillo, Sasson and Shirley Soffer, Daphne Mumford, and DuBack himself. Some pieces included sculptural elements ‚Äî figures in wood and fabric ‚Äî mounted to the canvas or board. An example of this resides in the public collection of the Portland Museum of Art: The Coopers, 1970. From the late 1970s and 80s, DuBack primarily painted landscapes (without figures). In the January 1974 edition of ARTS magazine, Holland Cotter wrote: ‚Äú‚Ä¶.This sense of tension is, perhaps, the most remarkable quality in DuBack‚Äôs works. These beautiful landscapes, perfect in calculation yet ingenuous, embody a striving for both simplistic vision and unreflective, almost photographic attempts to contain 'what is'. These appositional perspectives produce an uneasy but successful marriage: the voices ‚Äî violent, soft, ironic, transcendent ‚Äî and always vibrantly and uniquely human.‚Äù His final works were notational abstractions of nature ‚Äî many imbued with the colors of the flora of the gulf coast of Florida, where he spent some winter months ‚Äî bright, short slashes of color on large canvases. = Exhibitions = DuBack exhibited his work throughout his life; his first solo exhibition was with Roko Gallery in New York, in 1953, and was honored with a major retrospective more than 50 years later at the Portland Museum of Art, in 2009. Throughout his career his work was shown nationwide, including: the Center for Maine Contemporary Art in Rockport Maine (2003); The National Academy, New York (1992); The National Academy of Design, New York (1990, 1982); The Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis, Indiana (1978); P.S.1, New York (1977); The Landmark Gallery, New York (1972, 1982); Einhorn Auditorium (Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture), New York (1966); the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1959‚Äì60); the Brooklyn Museum, New York (1959, 1953); Bowdoin College, Maine (1957); Colby College (with Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture), Maine (1957). = Public collections = DuBack's work can be found in public collections nationwide, including: The Portland Museum of Art, Portland, ME; Colby College, Waterville, ME; Bowdoin College, Brunswick, ME; Lehman Brothers, NYC; Art in Embassies program, Washington, D.C.; Emory University, Atlanta, GA; Port Authority, NYC; Columbia Museum of Art, Columbia, SC; Citibank, NYC; The Butler Museum of American Art, CT; Westchester University, Westchester, PA; American University, Washington, D.C..

Early life and family  Windley was born in 1909, the son of Edward Crosland Windley and Florence de Toustain, Vicomtesse de Toustain. He was educated at Repton School and studied at St Catharine's College, Cambridge from 1927 to 1930. Windley married Patience Ann Sergison-Brooke, the daughter of Sir Bertram Sergison-Brooke and Prudence Sergison, on 29 March 1939. They had a daughter, Davina, who married George Dawson-Damer, 7th Earl of Portarlington.  Career  Much of Windley's early career was spent as an administrator in Kenya. He was appointed as a district officer of Narok District on 9 December 1936 and then as a district officer of Masai District, based in Kajiado, on 27 February 1938.Kenya Gazette: vol. XXXVIII no. 70 p. 1543. 29 December 1936.Kenya Gazette: vol. XL no. 19 p. 359. 5 April 1938. He became the District Commissioner in Narok on 27 February 1945.Kenya Gazette: vol.

He served as Governor of the Gambia from 12 June 1958 to 29 March 1962. On 29 September 1959, a revised constitution drawn up by Windley was published. It established the House of Representatives of the Gambia, to replace the Legislative Council. One of his aims as Governor was to encourage a union between the Gambia and the neighbouring French colony of Senegal, which achieved independence in 1960. Following the 1960 election, Windley made the controversial decision to appoint Pierre Sarr N'Jie as the first Chief Minister of the Gambia despite the United Party not holding a majority in the House. For his services, he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) and a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).

After finishing unplaced in her only race as a juvenile she won a maiden race on her debut as a three-year-old and then recorded an emphatic six-length victory in the Irish 1000 Guineas. She failed to reproduce her form in two subsequent races and was retired in 2007. Since her retirement from racing she has had some success as a broodmare. Background Nightime is a chestnut mare with a broad white blaze and a long white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by her owner Marguerite Weld. She was trained throughout her racing career by Weld's son Dermot at the Curragh in County Kildare. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became a very successful breeding stallion and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland five times. His other progeny included Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Nightime's dam Caumshinaun, who produced seven other winners, was a successful racemare who won five races including the Listed Platinum Stakes in 2001. She was a distant descendant of the British broodmare Springtime (foaled 1932), the ancestor of numerous major winners including Blakeney, Morston and Classic Cliche. Racing career =2005: two-year-old season= Rather than beginning her career in a maiden race, Nightime made her debut in the Group Three C L Weld Park Stakes, a race named in honour of Dermot Weld's father (and Marguerite's husband), over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 1 October. Ridden by Pat Shanahan she started at odds on 12/1 and finished seventh of the eight runners, three and a half lengths behind the winner Ugo Fire. =2006: three-year-old season= On her first run as a three-year-old Nightime started the 9/10 favourite in a ten-runner maiden over eight and a half furlongs at Cork Racecourse on 16 April. Ridden by Pat Smullen, who partnered her in all her subsequent races she disputed the lead for most of the way before pulling ahead in the final furlong and winning by two lengths from Miss Dela. On 28 May Nightime was stepped up to Group One class and started at odds of 12/1 in a fifteen-runner field for the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile on heavy ground at the Curragh. The betting was dominated by three British challengers with Confidential Lady (winner of the Prix du Calvados and runner-up in the 1000 Guineas) heading the market from Short Dance (Radley Stakes, Michael Seely Memorial Stakes) and Nasheej (Sweet Solera Stakes, May Hill Stakes, Fred Darling Stakes). The other Irish runners included Race For The Stars (Oh So Sharp Stakes), Ugo Fire, Queen Cleopatra (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial), Abigail Pett (Silver Flash Stakes, Round Tower Stakes) and Kamarinskaya (Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial). Confidential Lady set the pace with Smullen settling Nightime behind the leaders before making steady progress in the straight. Nightime overtook the favourite a furlong and a half from the finish and drew clear of her opponents to win by six lengths from the 50/1 outsider Ardbrae Lady. After the race Dermot Weld said \\"It is a very special day for me... My mother has always believed in the filly. I wanted to sell her as a yearling but she wouldn't let me, as she thought she was special, and she has been proven right. She is in her 90th year this year and this is lovely for her.\\" Describing his winning ride, Pat Smullen commented \\"Confidential Lady going off in front was great because she brought me there perfectly. I knew she would stay a mile and a quarter, so I kicked on. If anything, I'm disappointed I won so far. But you can't afford to mess around with losing momentum in that ground\\". The ground was much firmer when Nightime was sent to England to contest the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 23 June. After turning into the straight in third place she faded quickly and was eased down by Smullen in the closing stages to finish last of the fifteen runners behind Nannina. =2007: four-year-old season= After an absence of more than eleven months Nightime returned to the track and was matched against male opposition in the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh on 27 May. She started a 25/1 outsider and made little impact as she finished eighth of the nine runners behind Notnowcato. Breeding record Nightime was retired from racing to become a broodmare for the Weld family. She has produced at least five winners including the multiple stakes winners Zhukova and Ghaiyyath: *La Chapelle, a bay filly, foaled in 2008, sired by Holy Roman Emperor. Unplaced on only start. *Sleeping Beauty, bay filly, 2010, by Oasis Dream. Won one race. *New Years Night, chestnut colt (later gelded) 2011, by Raven's Pass.

On the way Othello captured St Anne, of 300 tons (bm), which was sailing from Buenos Aires to Cadiz. St Anne was carrying 8,500 dry hides, 180 boxes of Peruvian bark (Cinchona), and four sacks of \\"fine Spanish wool\\".

The H√¥tel de Felzins in Toulouse, France, is a Renaissance h√¥tel particulier (palace) of the 16th century, also called H√¥tel de Molinier. This mansion located in the historical center of Toulouse was built in the middle of the 16th century (1550-1556) for parliamentarian Gaspard Molinier. The hotel is representative of the Toulouse mansions, characteristic with its Renaissance motifs. It is particularly noteworthy for its Mannerist portal on the Rue de la Dalbade, with rich and exuberant decor. A room on the ground floor has preserved its monumental fireplace of the sixteenth century, Henry II style. Engraved above the upper bas-relief, which represents the demi-god Hercules, are the mentions Hercules Gallicus and Charitas nunquam excidit. Two medallions represent Roman emperors. History Works to build this house started in 1550 for Gaspard Molinier, a powerful man and long time member of the parliament. The entrance comprises a monumental gate surmounted with numerous sculptures, including monstruous beings and marble inlays. This ensemble corresponds to the then-new style known today as mannerism, whose principal traits are an abundance of sculpted figures, the depiction of a fantastic bestiary, and a marked taste for relief and polychromatic interplays.Explanatory comments of Toulouse Renaissance exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche. The taste for marble inlays in architecture would endure until the start of the following century. The quarries of the Pyrenees were the source of this precious material which, from Toulouse, was sent to royal building projects, such as the Louvre. The sculptor, as yet unidentified, drew inspiration from the engravings of Marcantonio Raimondi and the works of the royal architect Sebastiano Serlio. The turret of the second courtyard gave rise to some erudite ornementation: magnificently sculpted putti play with a floral garland, symbolizing abundance and fertility. Immediately above them, the small consoles featuring pods or cloves resemble those of H√¥tel d'Ass√©zat. H√¥tel Molinier also contains the most beautiful fireplace of Renaissance Toulouse, it being built between 1551 and 1556. The sculptor took for model a fireplace of Ch√¢teau de Madrid (a royal castle near Paris) designed by Girolamo della Robbia for king Francis I. The hood bears a scene that evoke Christian charity, through the inscription, and a Gaulish Hercules on the sculpted bas-relief. Hercules enchains the populace, without restraining them, by means of a bond that links his mouth to the ears of Man. It is, therefore, a celebration of eloquence and good government, a symbol French royalty would appropriate in the sixteenth century. Combining the virtues of Christianity, politics and intellect, the sculpture of the fireplace commissioned by Gaspard Molinier reflected the aspirations of the erstwhile consellor to the king.

This technique was introduced in the 1990s to help manage severe chronic pain and improve the opioid response in cancer patients. In order to obtain adequate levels of pain relief, patients requiring chronic opioid therapy may require an increase in the original prescribed dose for a number of reasons, including increased pain or a worsening disease state. Over the course of long term treatment, an increase in dosage cannot be continued indefinitely as unwanted side effects of treatment often become intolerable once a certain dose is reached, even though the pain may still not be properly managed. One solution to this is to switch the patient between different opioid drugs over time, usually every few months. Opioid rotation requires strict monitoring in patients with ongoing levels of high opioid doses for extended periods of time, since long term opioid use can lead to a patient developing tolerance to the analgesic effects of the drug. Patients may also not respond to the first opioid prescribed to them at all, therefore needing to try another opioid to help manage their pain. A patient's specific response and sensitivity to opioids include many factors that include physiology, genetics and pharmacodynamic parameters, which together determine the amount of pain control and tolerance of a particular opioid.  Mechanism  Opioid analgesic drugs tend to exhibit incomplete cross-tolerance, so that even when a patient has developed a high level of tolerance to one drug from this class, they may find that a different opioid drug will still be effective. The reasons for this are still not completely understood, but are thought to result from variations in opioid receptor affinity and occupancy levels at equianalgesic doses, as well as additional mechanisms of action possessed by some drugs such as the NMDA antagonist action of methadone or levorphanol, or the SNRI activity of tramadol or tapentadol.  Indications  There are no clinical guidelines outlining the use and implementation of opioid rotation. However, this strategy is commonly used for these various situations: pain not controlled by current opioid, pain controlled but in the presence of intolerable adverse events, pain not controlled despite rapid increase in opioid dose, switching to utilize different alternative routes of administration, or switching due to high cost of current opioid (or other patient-specific cost considerations). Potential issues While there is good evidence for the efficacy of opioid rotation as a treatment approach in general, there is less evidence for what particular opioid analgesics are most suitable, and in practice the choice of opioid drugs used depends on many factors such as patient characteristics, prescriber preferences and safety. One issue with opioid rotation is that an opioid therapy failure poorly predicts whether other opioids would be effective. In certain situations, multiple switches may be required before pain therapy is optimized.Fine, Perry G, and Russell K Portenoy. ‚ÄúStrategies for Opioid Rotation: Decision Support in Chronic Pain Management.‚Äù Medscape, Medscape, 30 Mar. 2010, www.medscape.org/viewarticle/717832. In addition, recent studies explore which opioid drugs are most effective in implementing in an opioid rotation, but have so far found no difference in efficacy between opioid drugs like methadone and fentanyl in cancer patients. Diversion of prescribed opioid drugs for illicit recreational use is also a particular concern in this field, as the drugs which are most effective for relieving suffering in palliative care also tend to be those most sought after by drug abusers. The choice of what opioid drug to use in which patient thus tends to be a balance between many different factors that must be considered, and the need for opioid rotation in chronic pain patients makes it advantageous for a wide range of different opioid drugs to be available, even though they may be broadly equivalent in action when used in shorter term treatment. Additionally, newer studies may explore which patient populations can benefit the most from opioid rotation and which populations can have their pain managed by other means.

It has been coming out since October 2001. Since December 2014 it belongs to . Nikolay Kononov is the editor-in-chief.  History  The Firm's Secret was created by in October 2001 as a monthly supplement to the weekly magazine Money of the publishing house Kommersant. The supplement was supposed to cover business seminars held by the publishing house in cooperation with the Higher School of Economics and Harvard Business School. Later, when the publishing house no longer needed the supplement, Katsman and his partners bought out The Firm's Secret and since September 2002 the magazine came out at first ‚Äì twice a week, then ‚Äì weekly. In 2004, a publishing house was established on the basis of the magazine, and also published a newspaper Business () and magazines You have the right () and Everything is clear (). In November 2005, the publishing house The Firm's Secret purchased an online newspaper Gazeta.ru for about $ 7-10 million.  Kommersant  Since the spring of 2006, the publishing house was looking for buyers for its unprofitable publications (the revenues of CJSC \\"The Firm's Secret\\" (–ó–ê–û ¬´–°–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç —Ñ–∏—Ä–º—ã¬ª) according to Russian Standards of Accountants in 2005 ‚Äî 216.75 million rubles, net loss ‚Äî 323.56 million rubles). On December 22, 2006 it was announced that the newspaper Business was bought by the group Moskovskiye Novosti. According to experts, the deal value was about $5-6 million, while in the autumn of the same year Rodionov Publishing House planned to buy it for $10-13 million. On the same day, Kommersant bought out the remaining newspapers. Former owners ‚Äì investment fund Cube Capital UK Limited (70%), Alexander Loktev and managing director Yuri Katsman ‚Äì received approximately $40 million. In 2007 the new owner closed the magazines You have the right and Everything is clear, and The Firm's Secret was transformed into a monthly magazine. For a long time Kommersant was publishing two competing publications: Money and the less popular The Firm's Secret (the Russian audience of the publications, according to TNS Russia for March-July 2014, was 238 thousand and 193,300 people over 12 years old for one issue, respectively). At the same time, the latter had a lower profitability in 2013-2014. It generated a loss while its annual revenue was about 60 million rubles, according to Vedomosti.  Rambler&Co;  In 2014, Kommersant received an offer from an unnamed company to buy the publication, after a while ' showed interest in the deal. On 14 November 2014 the negotiations between the two holdings began. On December 25, it was announced that the deal has been accomplished. According to Vedomosti sources, Rambler&Co; paid 10 million rubles for the brand The Firm's Secret and the right to use the electronic archive of the magazine. Then it became known that the December printed issue of the magazine would be the last one (circulation for November 2014 ‚Äì 65 000 copies). It was assumed that the publication will keep part of the Kommersant team. However, Marina Ivanyuschenkova, who had been the editor-in-chief for 13 years, decided not to move to Rambler&Co.; At the end of the month it was reported that the publication could be headed by the editorial director of ', Nikolay Kononov, and that a few people from Hopes&Fears; (an online business newspaper which was closed in July 2014) would move to the new publication along with him. On January 12, 2015, Kononov and four key employees of the editorial board moved to The Firm's Secret. Thereafter, the whole team of Hopes&Fears; moved to the new project, except for the chief editor Anna Sokolova and editor Yuri Bolotov. According to Kononov, a series of decisions by the holding management prompted him to quit: first ‚Äì the merge of H&F; with The Village, which meant closing the business online newspaper that raised a monthly audience of about 800 thousand people in a year and a half, and then ‚Äì using a successful name for a new English- language lifestyle newspaper. The updated editorial staff of The Firm's Secret did not include journalists from Kommersant, with the only exception of the long-time journalist Nikolay Grishin. The publication is a separate department within Rambler&Co.; On March 19, 2015, the website was relaunched on the new domain secretmag.ru. At that time, 14 people worked in The Firm's Secret. When launching the newspaper, the editorial board announced plans to release about 20 materials daily. Monetization was planned at the expense of media and contextual advertising, as well as special projects. In February 2016, the publication became one of the websites on which Rambler&Co;, together with MTS, tested paid switching-off of the advertisement.

The company was founded in 1932 as Uniloy Accessories Corporation, and is located in Monroe, North Carolina. In 2001 it was acquired by Tyco International and in 2017 it was acquired by 3M. History: Uniloy and Scott Aviation In 1932 the company was founded in Lancaster, New York by Earl M. Scott as Uniloy Accessories Corporation, an aeronautics parts producer. It later changed its name to Scott Aviation, and that same year they began creating a portable on-board oxygen system for their pilots. In 1945 they began producing the Air-Pak SCBA, after which use of the SCBA began in the field of firefighting. Scott Aviation was acquired by Figgie International in 1967, and in 1976 Scott Aviation partnered with NASA to produce the first high-pressure SCBA. The company was renamed Scott Technologies in 1997, and in 1999 it separated into two companies: Scott Aviation and Scott Health and Safety.http://www.forberg.com/pdf/lineCard/Home_Partners_scott_Company%20Overview.pdf The company is headquartered in Monroe, North Carolina,http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/outside_the_loop/2015/02/scott- safety-in-monroe-to-get-67-new-jobs-29m.html and the company has facilities in other locations, including the UK, Australia, China, and Abu Dhabi. Scott Safety produces fire safety apparatuses, including PPE, air purifying respirators, compressors, and gas detection systems. These are used by military personnel, industrial workers, and first responders, including firefighters. Prior to 2001, the company was traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol SCTT. In 2001 the company was acquired by Tyco International, and in 2011 it changed its name from Scott Health and Safety to Scott Safety. In 2014 Scott Safety acquired the gas and flame protection company Industrial Safety Technologies for $329.5 million. In 2017, 3M entered negotiations to acquire Scott Safety for $2 billion. On April 26, 2018, 3M announced the rebranding of Scott Safety to 3M Scott Fire & Safety. Apparatuses The company still produces its flagship product, the Scott Air-Pak SCBA. Scott Safety creates several kinds of compressor systems including the HushAir 7500 Connect which includes the HushAir Connect RevolveAir Connect for filling SCBA cylinders, and SmartTouch Controller, which integrates the breathing air compressor, storage bottles, and a charge station. The systems use a 7500 psi design. It also produces the Duraflow breathing apparatus, which is used by medical personnel to avoid breathing in airborne disease such as avian flu. In addition to Scott Safety gas detection systems, they have published a gas detection system reference guide that covers various gases and their health effects. In 2016 Scott Safety began producing firefighting masks with thermal imaging named Scott Sight,http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2016/10/21/new-scott-safety- heat-camera-wins-magazine-award.html which supplements hand held thermal imaging technology. Inside the helmet there is a screen that allows firefighters to view the thermal imaging results at the same time they are viewing outside the mask. The image appears in the peripheral view, at nine frames per second over a period of up to four hours. The camera and display mounted in the helmet weighs 8.5 ounces.

History View of the P√°tio do Carmo Square in 1878. The first Carmelite friars arrived in Brazil in 1580, coming from Portugal. In 1584, with the foundation of a convent in Olinda the first one built in Brazil, the first Brazilian festivity was held in honor to Our Lady of Mount Carmel. In 1654 the Our Lady of Mount Carmel was established in Recife. In 1665, Captain Diogo Cavalcanti Vasconcelos began the construction of the basilica and ordered the execution of the main chapel at his own expense, without the royal license which, demanded in 1674, was granted only on March 8, 1687. In that same year the Pal√°cio da Boa Vista, erected by John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, was donated to the Order to be integrated to the complex of the Basilica and the Convent. The temple was completed almost one hundred years later, in 1767. In this church the head of Zumbi dos Palmares was exposed until complete decomposition. The church is next to the Convent do Carmo, where Frei Caneca made his religious vows and he became a priest, and where he is supposed to be buried. In 1909 the Our Lady of Mount Carmel was proclaimed Patroness of Recife, and 21 of September 1919 was \\"crowned\\". In 1917, the church was added to the St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. In 1922, the temple was elevated to the status of basilica. The Basilica and the Convent do Carmo were registered on October 5, 1938 by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN).  Architecture  Interior. The church follows the Baroque style. The main body has two floors, both with three openings of bowed arches and ornaments in stonemasonry. In the upper floor, between the windows, there are two niches with statues, interconnected in the upper part of oculuss filled with grids, and also framed. Above, triangular frontispiece of truncated vertices and curved sides, with shield of the Order, heavy flowery volutes, and culminating with a niche with image of Our Lady, pinnacles and a cross. Laterally the church has two towers, the one on the right remains unfinished, and the one on the left, about 50 meters high, stands on four floors, with openings of shape of varying size: that of the base is a door with arch, and a successively open arch door, with a baluster, a simple oculus, and a bell-window also in full arc. Crowning the tower, dome with several ornate overlapping cornices, oculus, pinnacles and cross. In the interior its decoration in gilt is priceless. Among the highlights are the twelve secondary altars and the main chapel, with its fabulous altarpiece with a life-size image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, lined with angels and saints, in a frame of luxuriant work of gold carving. The other altars are also richly decorated, highlighting those of Our Lady of the Candles and the one of St. Teresa of √Åvila, Sts. Crispin and Crispinian. Several interventions in the 19th and 20th centuries ended up de-characterizing some original aspects of the interior, especially the painting of the carvings. Practically the whole Basilica was repainted in white and gold. A recent restoration project, which removed the overcoating layers, revealed all the beauty of the marbled decoration typical of the 18th century, with the Basilica being reopened on July 6, 2001, after three years of work. Other alterations in the main altar included the enthronement of the present image of Our Lady, another one of Christ and the installation of a reliquary to guard the sacramental breads. The restoration of the chapel also contemplated the rosewood chair, with the restoration of lost parts of the wood and the recovery of the six panels with images of saints and the six tribunes with balusters that are above the stall.

It premiered on Showtime on April 2, 2017.  Plot  Quinn (Rupert Friend) explains to Carrie (Claire Danes) that he found Sekou's original van, which had been swapped for one loaded with a bomb, in the garage of the flag house. Carrie notes that the conspirators can all be brought to justice with that evidence, but Quinn responds that he wants to kill Belli (C.J. Wilson) regardless. A disagreement leads to Quinn revealing that he knows Carrie woke him up from his coma in Berlin, causing him to suffer a stroke. Saul (Mandy Patinkin) presents President-elect Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) with the evidence that links Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) to Brett O'Keefe (Jake Weber). O'Keefe publicly takes credit for distributing the Andrew Keane video and invites the president-elect to appear on his show. Keane accepts the offer. On the live broadcast, Keane declares that O'Keefe manipulated the video of Andrew Keane, manufactured the online reactions with his own social media firm, and that his firm is actually being funded by people in the government. Max (Maury Sterling) gets a meal tray delivered to him which includes an access card, enabling him to escape the facility. When he exits, he's immediately grabbed by men who forcibly deliver him to Dar Adal. Dar asks Max for help in ascertaining what O'Keefe is planning in regards to Quinn. Max hacks into the corporation's data backups and unearths a large number of online communications, purporting to be from Quinn, portraying him as a volatile ex- soldier with an extreme vendetta against Elizabeth Keane. When morning breaks, Quinn leaves, claiming to be trailing the special ops group. He tells Carrie how to get into the flag house. Carrie investigates the seemingly empty house, only to be attacked by Belli. As she tries to fight him off, Quinn storms in, shooting Belli and then brutally beating him to death. Quinn explains himself by telling Carrie how Astrid died at Belli's hands. FBI responders arrive on the scene, along with Solicitor General Pallis (David Thornton), who assures Carrie that Quinn will be granted immunity. Quinn inspects partially erased letters from the whiteboard in the house, trying to determine the special ops group's current assignment. Being familiar with the code they use, he's able to narrow the location of their assignment down to \\"B\\" (for Bravo time zone, indicating Middle East) or \\"R\\" (Romeo, indicating East Coast of the U.S.). Carrie grows concerned at the latter possibility, and calls Rob (Hill Harper) in order to check on the President-elect. Carrie watches from the front yard as FBI personnel open the garage door, triggering a hidden bomb in the garage, which explodes. Carrie and Quinn check for survivors as the episode ends.

The H√¥tel de Bagis in Toulouse, France, is a Renaissance h√¥tel particulier (palace) of the 16th century. It is a listed historical monument since 1889. H√¥tel de Pierre, dit aussi h√¥tel Jean de Bagis It is also called H√¥tel de Clary, after the owner who carried out the second campaign of works at the beginning of the 17th century, or H√¥tel de pierre (meaning ¬´stone hotel¬ª) because of its spectacular stone fa√ßade on the street. History The Hotel de Bagis is a mansion located at 25 rue de la Dalbade, in the historic center of Toulouse. The Toulouse people call it the H√¥tel de Pierre (stone mansion), because its fa√ßade is entirely made of stone, which was unique in Toulouse in the 17th century. It is an exceptional ensemble of the Renaissance of Toulouse. The construction of a first hotel begins in 1537 under the direction of the famous Toulouse architect Nicolas Bachelier. The hotel was modified in 1611 by the architect Pierre Souffron, who built the new fa√ßade on the street, entirely in stone. The sculptured decoration was only completed in the 19th century. = Facade = The hotel opens onto the Dalbade Street with a majestic facade. Composed of eight bays, its axis of symmetry is formed by the two central bays, identical, of which the one on the left only houses the gateway. The monumental facade was erected between 1609 and 1616 at the request of Gabrielle Guerrier and her husband Fran√ßois de Clary by the architect Pierre Souffron, assisted by several sculptors and stone-cutters who succeed each other on the building site: Pierre Bouc, Thomas Heurtematte, Pierre Monge and Arthur Legoust. The facade is richly decorated with a carved stone decoration: pilasters, trophies of arms, garlands, fruits. Fran√ßois de Clary placed on the capitals of acanthus, eagles and suns which recall his coat of arms. His weapons are also placed above the gates, but they are hammered at the French Revolution. In 1855, Calvet-Besson completed the sculptures on the fa√ßade and placed the coat of arms of Fran√ßois de Clary and his monogram above the doors. He entrusted the realization to the architect Urbain Vitry and the sculptor Calmettes.

The elevations on the courtyard, where the stone and the brick are mingled, are richly ornamented. The work of Bachelier is still visible on the west elevation, which is the one which has been least altered by the campaigns of successive works. Similar openings are nevertheless found on the south and east facades. Between 1609 and 1616, Fran√ßois de Clary caused the fa√ßades of the south buildings to be modified and was built on a courtyard by the construction of porticos. He also affixed stone veneers with pilasters, mascarons and capitals intended to support statues Bagis-fa√ßade.jpg Bagis- etage-0.jpg Bagis-etage-1.jpg Bagis-etage-2.jpg Clary-fa√ßades-cour.jpg H√¥tel de Pierre 1.JPG H√¥tel de Pierre 2.JPG H√¥tel de Pierre 6.JPG H√¥tel de Pierre 7.JPG H√¥tel de Pierre 8.JPG = The door of the Atlanteans = The door of the Atlanteans was long attributed to Nicolas Bachelier (1538), but recent studies indicate that it would rather be at the very beginning of the 17th century.

Afterwards, this work was continually expanded, and also came to include contributions by a third brother, Tsjalling, until all the Halbertsma Brothers' prose and poetry was posthumously collected in 1871 to become the famous work Rimen en Teltsjes.Breuker 1993, pp. 603‚Äì606. Although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics,Breuker 1993, pp. 594‚Äì596. it is undeniable that Rimen en Teltsjes played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.Jensma, p. 197. Life =Youth and background= Justus Hiddes Halbertsma was born on October 23, 1789, in the village of Grou, in the central part of the Dutch province of Friesland,Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 38. in the house of his parents on Kowemerk (\\"Cow Market\\") street.Wiersma, p. 7.

Two children who were born later died in early childhood, the little boy in 1803, and the little girl in 1805. The four brothers were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Justus was just twenty years of age and the others were even younger.Wiersma, pp. 8‚Äì9. Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje, who, as authors, became known as the Brothers Halbertsma later in life,Hemminga, p. 56. were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother. Ruerdtsje Binnerts was a scion of a prominent family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although her husband had been raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From Justus' letters Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person.Wiersma, p. 8. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland (\\"Terrible Ice- drift and Flooding in Gelderland\\"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait. In 1858, Justus Halbertsma explained the difference between his parents' families when he wrote: \\"One cannot deny the Halbertsmas a greater skillfulness, speed of thought, a greater adroitness, quickness, and talent than the family of Ruerdtsje Tsjallings; but wat help was that to them against the poverty which overcame most of them, while Ruerdtsje Tsjallings' family for the most part maintain prosperity to this day as part of the dignified middle class?\\" Against the superior power of those who calmly and calculatedly grew rich, he wrote somewhere else, the Halbertsmas could only \\"avenge themselves through satire.\\" =Education, clerical career, and family= Halbertsma's mother Ruerdtsje was the main force behind the thorough education her sons received. Justus she sent to the French school in the provincial capital of Leeuwarden for a year, and after that, she enrolled him in the Latin school in Leeuwarden from 1801 to 1806. At the advice of his mother and the Mennonite minister Jan Brouwer, from Leeuwarden, Justus Halbertsma chose a clerical career, for which he studied theology at the Mennonite Seminary in Amsterdam from 1807 to 1813.Wiersma, p. 9. In that period he also immersed himself in the study of the North Germanic languages. In 1814, Halbertsma became minister in Bolsward, where he remained until 1821. Afterwards, he served the Mennonite congregation in the city of Deventer, in the province of Overijssel, from 1822 to his retirement in 1856. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma, drawn by an unknown artist, around 1835. Halbertsma married Johanna Iskjen Hoekema (1794‚Äì1847), a Mennonite minister's daughter from Workum, who came from a well-to-do middle- class family, on May 10, 1816. Through his wife Halbertsma attained possession of the farmstead Westerein, near Workum, where he and his family often spent a couple of weeks in summer. Apart from those holidays, he lived out his entire life in Deventer. Halbertsma and his wife had five sons from a good marriage, which was however not without its share of problems. Of these sons Petrus, Hidde, and Tsjalling studied linguistics or medicine, while Watse en Binnert became mariners. As a father, Halbertsma experienced a large amount of grief, as his son Petrus died in 1851 in a psychiatric hospital, while Binnert passed away in 1861, and Hidde took his own life in 1865. =As a literary figure= Halbertsma had been greatly influenced in his student years by his acquaintance with the well-to-do and influential Amsterdam merchant Jeronimo de Vries, who championed a national art, inspired by the Dutch Golden Age. These ideas flew in the face of more modern notions advocated by writers such as Hi√´ronymus van Alphen and Johannes Klinker. For Halbertsma, who was first and foremost a Frisian, and only secondly a Dutchman, this meant an orientation towards national Frisian ideals,Breuker 1993, pp. 588‚Äì589. from which emanated two goals he set himself in life.Breuker 1993, p. 589. Firstly, he wanted to preserve the Western Frisian language by using it for writing again after it had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.Boelens et al., p. 116.Wiersma, p. 11. From that it followed that he had to get the Frisians to read in their own language (otherwise, writing it would not be of much use), and that he should record the Frisian vocabulary in a dictionary, which would be the first dictionary ever of the Frisian language. And secondly, Halbertsma wanted to put renowned Frisian people from the past in the spotlight, to serve as an example for his contemporaries. To attain his first goal, Halbertsma had to use his writings to penetrate the daily life of the Frisian people. This he achieved by authoring folk literature with his brother Eeltsje. The state and social status of the Western Frisian language at that time becomes clear if one observes the fact that Halbertsma and his brothers, though they laboured tirelessly for the use of Frisian as a written language for poetry and prose, lapsed into Dutch for their correspondence with each other, and apparently did not feel that was in any way strange.Boelens et al., s. 116. As Halbertsma remained the editor of Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and short fiction were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning.Breuker 1993, p. 593. For that reason the linguist Foeke Buitenrust Hettema would describe Halbertsma later as the 'literary agent' of his brothers Eeltsje and Tsjalling. In 1822, their early works were collected under the title De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar (\\"Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket\\"; original, archaic spelling: De Lape Koer fen Gabe Skroor), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.Breuker 1993, p. 597.Twerda, p. 297. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time. The first edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, published in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only.Terpstra, p. 313.Twerda, pp. 297‚Äì298.Wiersma, s. 5, 11. Those were not sold, however, but at the expense of Halbertsma presented to acquaintances of his all over Friesland.Twerda, p. 298. In that way he awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature. These stories and poems were in fact something entirely different from what the readers were used to, not only as to what language they were witten in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. The copies of the booklet often were shared around through entire networks of family and friends, and not seldom the stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on. A second, expanded edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size.Wiersma, p. 5, 11. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (De Noarger R√∫n oan Gabe Skroar), 1840 (Twigen √∫t in Alde Stamme), 1854 (Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen), and 1858 (De Jonkerboer and Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonst√™d).Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 589‚Äì594. By the end of his life, Halbertsma assisted in the editing of a portion of Rimen en Teltsjes (Rhymes and Tales), the comprehensive publication in which all the Halbertsma Brothers' literary works were collected. He even wrote some new pieces for it, such as the short story It Grouwe Pak (\\"The Thick Suit\\").Breuker 2016, p. 1127. As a writer, Halbertsma strongly sensed what the public needed, but at the same time he was a somewhat distant and cerebral author, which tended to have an averse effect on his poetry, especially compared to the poems of his brother Eeltsje, who was a much more emotional writer.Dykstra and Oldenhof, pp. 38‚Äì40. Nevertheless, at least some of Halbertsma's poems, for instance Sibbel fan De Ryp (\\"Sibbel from De Ryp\\") and Nacht (\\"Night\\") have made a lasting impression.Terpstra, p. 318. That said, Halbertsma's short stories were much more acute thanks to his limber use of language, his lively style of writing, and the fact that he refused to mince his words, leading to a rough, scoffing, and sometimes darkly grim atmosphere. His subject-matter Halbertsma collected from various sources, including German and French oral literature, which he matchlessly revised and placed in Friesland. He was a non-conformist, whose sharp judgments of the works of others made him far from universally loved. Before everything else, Halbertsma as a writer was an essayist and a satirist, who liked to include topical political and social questions in his literary works. From the anecdotes of people who knew or met him, he emerges as a sharp-witted and extremely diligent man of capacious erudition who was a droll story-teller. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma in a photograph dated August 3, 1861. It Boalserter Nut (\\"The Bolsward Utility\\" ‚Äì the name of a gentlemen's club), which was published in De Lapekoer, was Halbertsma's first short story of a more extended length. As is often the case with Halbertsma's stories, it consists of a frame-story in which several other more or less stand-alone components are absorbed, such as the essay It Jild (\\"The Money\\").Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 40. Miswier (\\"Continuously Bad Weather\\") and De Twadde J√ªn (\\"The Second Evening\\") are also extensive frame-stories, and De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas (\\"Boss Joute's Barbershop\\") is a dialogue, which includes the intriguing and completely stand-alone story Heksershol (\\"Hole of Witchcraft\\" ‚Äì an old nickname for the village of Molkwerum). The only time Halbertsma wrote a literary work entirely without the participation of Eeltsje, was in 1837, when he published Oan E√∂lus (\\"To Aeolus\\"),Breuker 1993, s. 591. a story inspired by a great storm in 1830, in which a tornado has blown thoughts and motifs together like whirling leaves.Dykstra en Oldenhof, s. 38. Oan E√∂lus could perhaps be seen as a clue that Halbertsma harboured greater literary aspirations than would fit in the De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar. =As a man of science= And yet, for all that, Halbertsma's literary works did not take centerstage in his life: that place was reserved for his scientific non- fiction books.Breuker 1993, p. 590. More than fifty years he laboured to complete his dictionary of Western Frisian titled Lexicon Frisicum, for which he chose Latin as the descriptive language, but it remained unfinished. He organised it along the lines of the German dictionary by the Brothers Grimm, but became enmeshed in the addition of insertions and in reworkings, and in writing long semantic etymologies, a part of the work for which he especially had a predilection. In the end, he never got past the letter F, and the dictionary remained a manuscript, which was published in its unfinished form after Halbertsma's death, in 1872. In the 20th century, the material Halbertsma gathered for his Lexicon Frisicum was used by de Frisian Academy to develop several Western Frisian dictionaries, notably the 25 part Wurdboek fan de Fryske Taal (\\"Dictionary of the Western Frisian Language\\"; published 1984‚Äì2011).Fryske Akademy, Andere Taaldiensten en Links Furthermore, Halbertsma was the driving force behind the commemoration of the life of the famous 17th century Frisian poet Gysbert Japiks in 1823,Wiersma, pp. 10‚Äì11. which is seen by some as the starting point of the Frisian Movement. Afterwards he published an extensive literary history work under the title Hulde aan Gysbert Japiks (\\"Hail to Gysbert Japiks\\") in two parts in 1824 and 1827. In 1829 Halbertsma wrote Het Geslacht der Van Harens (\\"The Lineage of the Van Harens\\"), in which he primarily described the lives and literary works of the brothers and 18th century Dutch-language writers from Friesland Onno Zwier van Haren and Willem van Haren, whose work he admired greatly. Halbertsma was also the author of an 1836 biography of the Frisian poet Jan Cornelis Pieters Salverda (1783‚Äì1836), which almost has a naturalistic feel to it. In 1843 he published a historical work about the Mennonites, called De Doopsgezinden en Hunne Herkomst (\\"The Mennonites and Their Origins\\"), and in 1851 he followed this up with Aanteekeningen op het Vierde Deel van den Spiegel Historiael van Jacob van Maerlant (\\"Notes on Part Four of the Spiegel Historiael by Jacob van Maerlant). Furthermore, in 1858, at the request of Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, whom he had met in London, Halbertsma published It Ewangeelje fen Matthewes, which was the first Frisian translation of the Biblical Gospel of Matthew (or of any gospel for that matter). This translation evoked a great deal of criticism from Halbertsma's contemporaries, who thought it was much too realistic; today, it still has an almost modern feel to it, showing that Halbertsma was far ahead of his time. Halbertsma had a reputation of being an erudite man, which he won at a young age. He was especially known as a scholar of the Germanic languages, and to the present day he is widely acknowledged to have been a larger-than-life figure in the field of linguistics.Breuker 1993, pp. 589‚Äì590. Shortly after returning to Friesland from his study in Amsterdam, friends from his student years who by then were occupying important posts within the civil service, introduced him to the social circles around the Frisian-minded provincial governor jonker Idsert Aebinga van Humalda. Later in life Halbertsma was acquainted with prominent Dutch literary figures, such as Willem Bilderdijk, and what's more, he maintained a lively correspondence with European greats, like the Danish linguist Rasmus Rask, the English poet Robert Southey, and the German linguist and fairytale-collector Jacob Grimm. Moreover, he was invited to join learned historical and linguistic societies in Leiden, Copenhagen, Berlin, Athens en Halle-Wittenberg. Hence Halbertsma expected to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably played a role in this, but there were other reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced on the edge of a burn-out for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, that he seems to have achieved a state of mental composure. In part because of his linguistic erudition, Halbertsma has been named as the author of the infamous Oera Linda Book, a falsified work which emerged in 1867 and was written in imitated Old Frisian. It pretended to be an early history of Friesland and the Frisian people, and for a while it was considered authentic, until it was exposed as a hoax.Schroor, p. 1957. However, it is considered much more likely that the true author of the Oera Linda Book was the librarian Eelco Verwijs, who lead the Provincial Library of Friesland and who had befriended Halbertsma,Breuker 1993, s. 589.Breuker 2016, s. 1957. or possibly the writer Fran√ßois Haverschmidt or the ship carpenter and self-taught freethinker Cornelis over de Linden. If Verwijs was the culprit, it is not thought to be impossible that Halbertsma tacitly or even openly provided him with advice. Bust in bronze of Justus Hiddes Halbertsma in Deventer. =Death= After his retirement, on October 26, 1856, which Halbertsma applied for himself because his heart was not in his duties as a minister anymore, he withdrew into his upstairs apartment, where from that point on he became increasingly more lonely as his family members and friends died away, although his foreign contacts through correspondence remained intact. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma died in Deventer on February 27, 1869, when he was 79 years of age. By that time he had been a widower for 22 years. He was survived by his sons Watse and Tsjalling. In 1947, the Dr. Joast Halbertsma Award, the highest provincial decoration in the field of historical (and later more general scientific) research concerning the province of Friesland was named in his honour. Legacy After the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.Breuker 1993, p. 604.Wiersma, p. 5. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes (\\"Rhymes and Tales\\"). This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature, and although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics, it is undeniable that Rimen en Teltsjes and its predecessor De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma's influence on subsequent Western Frisian literature was enormous and of incalculable value. In 1949, author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \\"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\\"Wadman, p. 14. As of today Rimen en Teltsjes still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics. On his travels to England, Scotland, and Ireland, in 1852 and 1853, Halbertsma was impressed by the number of museums and cabinets of antiquities there were. This provided him with the idea to transfer his own collection of antiquities (originating for a major part in Hindeloopen, while the remainder came mostly from excavations of Frisian terps) to the Province of Friesland. In 1853, the Cabinet of Antiquities of Friesland was formed out of his collection, which in 1881 became the Frisian Museum.Schroor, p. 873. Halbertsma also gave to the Province of Friesland, in part when he was still alive, his extensive library of scientific books, which was added to the Provincial Library of Friesland, en is to this day available for scientific research purposes at Tresoar. A large collection of letters written by and to Halbertsma, including hundreds to his brothers Eeltsje en Tsjalling, long remained in the custody of the Halbertsma family, until they were given, in the course of the 20th century, on permanent loan to the Frisian Literary Museum and Documention Centre (FLMD), which became part of Tresoar in 2002.

In 1957, with the creation and installation of the Catholic archdiocese of Goi√¢nia, Archbishop Fernando Gomes dos Santos, the first archbishop of this archdiocese, presented a project for the construction of the sanctuary. In 1974 it was possible to carry out the novena and the feast of the Divine Eternal Father on the site. In 1994 began the reform and adaptation of the building in order to give it the dignity of being called \\"Sanctuary of the Divine Eternal Father\\". With the help of pilgrims and devotees, the temple was completely renovated. In 2006 under the pontificate of Benedict XVI the church was declared Basilica.

The H√¥tel Jean de Pins in Toulouse, France, is a Renaissance h√¥tel particulier (palace) of the 16th century. Its double gallery on the courtyard is a listed historical monument since 1995. H√¥tel de Pins et h√¥tel Antonin History H√¥tel de Pins, built by humanist Jean de Pins, was almost entirely demolished in the early twentieth century to make way for a new street known as rue de Languedoc. Some remains of the building, considered in the sixteenth century as a 'magnificent palace', did in fact survive ans were incorporated into H√¥tel Antonin, built on same site in 1903, ans H√¥tel Thomas de Montval on rue Croix-BaragnonExplanatory comments of Toulouse Renaissance exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche.. Jean de Pins, senator to Milan (1515), French ambassador to Venice (1516-1520) and later Rome (1520-1522), returned to Toulouse to devote himself to the humanities and start the construction of his townhouse around 1530. Located close to the parliament on a plot measuring more than 3,000 square metres, the h√¥tel comprised two houses placed at right angles. One was situated between the street and the courtyard, while the other, larger one stood between the courtyard and the garden. They were connected by a system of superimposed galleries. Architecture Jean de Pins returned from Italy with a taste for architectural regularity and repetition (arcades) ans an attraction for outdoor pleasures (galleries, garden). He also broke with the Toulousain tradition of the great staircase tower. In 1542 the next owner, the merchant Jean de Nolet, started adapting it to his needs by building a shop with arcades opening on to the street and a side entrance to the courtyard. In 1903 the architect Joseph Thillet cleverly assembled two galleries in the courtyard of H√¥tel Antonin. The ground-floor gallery came from the section modified by Nolet in 1542, while the first floor came from the period of Jean de Pins. Ornementation The ornementation in the courtyard is typical of the Renaissance. In addition to the human figure, which is celebrated in the portrait medallions, the attentive observer will notice very precise references to classical architecture. Indeed, Jean de Pins instructed the mason working for him to sculpt the Ionic pilasters on the gallery according to the engraving of a treatise on classical architecture published in Italy in 1521, which he probably discovered during his travels. In 1542, Jean de Nolet hired the famous sculptor and architect Nicolas Bachelier for the creation of medallions, the majority of which are currently at the H√¥tel Thomas de Montval.

It involves first char-grilling, roasting, or broiling chicken or fish and then adding them to a soup with tomatoes, onions, scallions, and ginger. Etymology The name linagpang or nilagpang means \\"done in the manner of lagpang\\". The root verb lagpang means \\"to grill food over hot coals\\" in Visayan languages. It is a synonym of sugba, anag, and lambon; and equivalent to Tagalog ihaw. In some Cebuano-speaking areas of the Visayas, it is still used to refer to grilled food, but it is now more commonly used to refer to the soup dish. Description Linagpang originates from the Hiligaynon people of the Western Visayas. The cooking process is derived from a way of consuming left-over grilled, roasted, or broiled chicken or fish and is still used in this way. But it can be prepared directly by first char-grilling, roasting, or broiling chicken or fish and then adding them to a soup with tomatoes, onions, scallions, and ginger. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, chilis, patis (fish sauce), or sugar to taste. Some versions also add pechay, basil, or coconut milk. The grilling adds a smoky dimension to the soup. In the chicken version (linagpang na manok), the chicken is usually shredded into flakes and uses native chicken. While in the fish version (linagpang na isda), the fish is sliced into crosswise chunks with the skin intact. The name of the dish can also reflect the type of fish used. Common fish linagpang include linagpang na bangus (milkfish), linagpang na tilapia (tilapia), and linagpang na turagsoy (common snakehead, known in Philippine English as \\"mudfish\\").

Lane served as the head of the Department of Biological Chemistry from 1978 to 1997, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1987, and was named a University Distinguished Service Professor - the institution's highest academic title - in 2001. Lane's research focused on the biochemistry of lipids and lipid metabolism, and the resulting physiological mechanisms regulating adipogenesis and obesity. Early life and education Lane was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 10, 1930 to Malcolm Daniel Lane Snr, an accountant at the Herald Tribune and Helga Wilke who was of Danish origin. He attended Iowa State University and received his B.S. in 1951 and his M.S. in 1953. He then moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign and received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1956. Academic career Lane began his faculty career immediately after finishing his Ph.D. with an appointment as an associate professor at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, where he advanced to full professor in 1963. After a brief sabbatical in Munich, Germany to work with Feodor Lynen, he moved from Virginia Tech to the New York University School of Medicine in 1964. Lane was recruited to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine by Albert Lehninger, chair of what was then known at the Department of Physiological Chemistry, in 1970. Lane subsequently succeeded Lehninger as department chair in 1978, changing the department's name to Biological Chemistry, and served in that position until 1997. At Johns Hopkins, Lane taught metabolism and metabolic biochemistry to medical students from his arrival in the department until 2006, and was well known for his teaching skills. He was also noted as an enthusiastic mentor of younger scientists, including support for the young laboratory of future Nobel Prize winner Peter Agre. He served on the editorial boards of several scientific journals, including a stint as executive editor of Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications in 1986. He held various leadership roles in the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, most notably serving as the society's president in 1990. Lane retired from his faculty position, assuming professor emeritus status, in 2008. Research In the early phases of his career, Lane was primarily interested in vitamins and vitamin metabolism, particularly in biotin-dependent enzymes such as propionyl-CoA carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which he studied in and purified from calf and chicken livers. This work was later recognized as classic in the field by the Journal of Biological Chemistry. His interest in vitamins and nutrition led him to focus later on lipogenesis and its regulation. Lane's laboratory published widely cited early studies of the insulin receptor and made extensive use of the 3T3-L1 cell line for investigating cellular differentiation processes leading to adipocytes. After the discovery of the satiety-regulating hormone leptin, Lane's laboratory focused its efforts on characterizing its regulation. Personal life Lane met and married his wife Patricia during his time at Iowa State. The couple had two children Danny Lane and Claudia Lane. Lane was an enthusiastic fisherman who enjoyed fishing and boating on the Chesapeake Bay. He was involved in local social justice and environmental activism. Lane died of myeloma on April 10, 2014.

History Built between 1901 and 1904 by the architect Jules Calbairac, H√¥tel Thomas de Montval on rue Croix-Baragnon also recycled some of the remains of the beautiful H√¥tel Jean de Pins (built in the sixteenth century and demolished at the start of the twentieth century). In total, eight arcades from the Renaissance townhouse were used for the left wing of the courtyard. They were also the inspiration for the architecture and the ornamentation of the right wing.Explanatory comments of Toulouse Renaissance exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche. These Renaissance arcades featuring portrait medallions were commissioned by the merchant Jean de Nolet in 1542 and executed by the sculptor Nicolas Bachelier. Their framework, featuring a floral wreath (referred to as a 'triumphal garland' in the surviving documents), draws on Roman triumphs (laurel), as well as the arms of the sixteenth-century merchant:¬´ On azure two palms or in saltire, surmonted by a wreath of roses proper on a fesse, ribonned argent and between three stars same, two borne in chief and one in point ¬ª. Ornementation The portrait medallions in the courtyard are typical of the Renaissance, they celebrate the human figure. This iconography draws its inspiration from the coins minted under various Roman emperors, gravestones and the decorative elements of classical shields. This theme enjoyed great success in the first half of the sixteenth century, permeating all the arts. The six original profiles still extant on H√¥tel Thomas de Montval depict the faces of a Moor, a king, a wreathed emperor, a man in sixteenth century fashion and two characters in Roman garb. Nicolas Bachelier's style is noticeable for the prominent arches of the eyebrows and the often very thick lips of his figures. In the early twentieth century Paul- Marius Thomas had six other medallions sculpted to give symmetry to the ornementation of courtyard arcades. They bear the portraits of family members in a Neo-Renaissance style.

The community is named after the heritage-listed ‚ÄòTulliallan‚Äô consisting of a stone brick \\"Shearers Cottage\\" constructed circa 1860 and an \\"Avenue of Elms\\", one of the largest private ones in the municipality. These Elm Trees are estimated to be 117 years old and have been generously donated by Tulliallan‚Äôs former owner Peter White and will border the future Elm Tree Gardens community parkland.  History  Since the 1840s there have been about a dozen different families who have owned this property. The Rossiter family owned the property for more than 20 years and were the first official owners. The Mitchell family also owned the land and George Mitchell came up with the name of Tulliallan, based on it being the name of his parents‚Äô home in Williamstown. George Mitchell‚Äôs father James Mitchell was on the committee that helped to choose the design for the Australian flag. The Elder family owned the property for longer than anyone else, being more than 30 years. The Strettle family also lived on this land for more than 20 years and actually purchased additional land to expand the size of the property. The 51 Elm trees down each side were planted in 2 stages since 1900 The historical 'Tulliallan' is a complex of farm buildings at the end of a long tree-lined driveway. Many of the buildings appear to date from the mid to late twentieth century. Buildings and structures that appear to pre-date World War Two include: = Brick and stone cottage = The cottage is located opposite the homestead entrance, facing north. It is a small single-storey structure constructed from hand-made red bricks (probably constructed on site or locally) and sandstone both of which have been painted with a white wash. The hipped roof is clad with corrugated galvanised steel, which is covers the early (or original) timber shingles. There is a single painted brick chimney. Doors are four-panel timber and windows are multi-pane double hung sashes. The south elevation is an open verandah with round timber columns. The cottage is in poor condition but is being maintained. The style and nature of construction suggests that it was constructed in the mid to late nineteenth century, possibly as early as c.1860. This building is possibly the one once known as the 'shearer's cottage' and may be the only building to survive from the pre-emptive right era of the Rossiter family. The Elms trees from a distant with Dandenong in the background = Outbuildings = The only pre WWII outbuilding is a small timber building to the south-west of the brick cottage, adjacent to the driveway. The function of this building, which is in poor condition is unknown. A second building, an interwar dwelling (fibro house/pavilion) identified in 2004, was demolished in c. 2005 and replaced on the same site by dwelling now at the west end of the entrance driveway on the south side. Other buildings are corrugated iron-clad sheds and a brick building, all dated from the post WWII period. = Avenue of elm trees = A key landscape element is the driveway, which is lined with an avenue of 51 Elms down each side. They are mature from the gates through to the 28th tree, and semi-mature after that indicating two stages of planting. The size of the more mature specimens suggests an original planting date of around 1900. About 10 of the trees are recent in-fill sapling plantings. Other related landscape elements are a number of cypresses (Cupressus Macrocarpa) which appear to have been planted in the early twentieth century as a wind-break, and there are more mature Cypress windbreaks in the surrounding paddocks. These vary in maturity and appear to date from the early to mid-twentieth century.

The Heritage Council of Victoria recognises, protects and celebrates Victoria‚Äôs cultural heritage and advises the government and others on how to conserve and protect historically important objects and places for the enjoyment of current and future generations. It is an independent statutory body and provides legal protection for places and objects that are important to the history and development of Victoria.

The Victorian Heritage Database lists the State's most significant heritage places, objects and historic shipwrecks protected under the Heritage Act 1995 states \\"The cottage is highly significant in a regional context as one of the few surviving buildings associated with the settlement of the study area during the pastoral era of 1850s and 60s prior to the land being opened for selection. It illustrates the development of cattle runs within the south east part of the Settled District of Port Philip. It has associations with locally important individuals including members of the Rossiter family, James Gibb and Captain Thomas Mitchell. The early development of the farm is also demonstrated by the now mature elm Avenue. Aesthetically, the Elm Avenue is significant as one of the largest private avenues in the municipality and provides a dramatic entry and setting for the farm complex. It also contributes to the broader cultural landscape within this area.\\"  Tulliallan today  Today Tulliallan, with its avenue of Elm trees, is a growing residential community developed by the RPM Real Estate Group.http://www.rpmrealestate.com.au/ There were 220 residents there as of 2015. The Tulliallan Primary School opened for Prep to Year 6 starting on 31 January 2017. With the help of Heather Arnold, a Local Historian Librarian for the Casey Cardinia Libraries, year 5 and year 6 students of the school based their House names on the previous owners of the land now occupied by the school as Rossiter Red, Mitchell Blue, Elder Yellow and Strettle Green in Mar 2017.

Early life and career Kornegay was born on 23 November 1913 in Bibb County, Alabama, the second of ten children of Will and Sue Kornegay.Souls Grown Deep Foundation: Rev. George Kornegay  Souls Grown Deep Foundation, accessdate: March 10, 2017Services Held in Loving Memory of Rev. George Paul Kornegay: Services Held in Loving Memory of Rev. George Paul Kornegay, accessdate: March 15, 2017 His father worked as a farmer, miner, and barrel maker, and his mother looked after their children. Kornegay attended the Alabama Mission School in Brent until the tenth grade, but had to leave school and help his father in sharecropping. His father later bought 28 acres of land near Brent, Alabama and a two-story house from a Cherokee, Charles Hogan, for $100. The property was situated on a Native American burial ground and Kornegay recounted that his daughter could \\"hear voices out here talking but she can't tell us what they're talking about. This is one of them places where you can come when you're feeling bad and go away lifted up. They all say this is a sacred place.\\" Kornegay worked at a steel mill, Century Foundry, in Tuscaloosa and later described his working life as \\"From a plow to a preacher, from a preacher to a steel mill, from a steel mill to a veneer mill. Double shifts I worked. And a cotton sack, and a plow, and a saw mill, and a paper mill, and all that stuff: had to make a living for my people\\". Marriage and religious calling Kornegay married Minnie Sue Tubbs on August 9, 1932, and they had 12 children; eight boys (Arthur Paul, George Jr., Earvin, Arthur Lee, Joel, Benjamin, Donald, and Ronnie) and four girls (Gloria Jean, Dorothy, Donna, and Annie). He felt a \\"divine calling\\" to become a minister and said that at first he was \\"...afraid of it, but God, he stayed at me. I ask him to give me these signs if this is what he mean for me. And he sent them. And the end of it come from a choir of angels come to visit my house. Come from the east into the house, go down the hall, go around my bedroom. And then leave to the west\\". Kornegay spent many years as a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (A.M.E. Zion), where he was affectionately known as \\"Big Daddy\\". Kornegay preached in the A.M.E. Zion churches at Grove Hill, Cottage Hill and Marietta for over fifty years. Art practice In 1960, Kornegay began to create a large narrative artwork (or \\"visionary environment\\") on a two acre site on a hill near his house using paintings, found objects and sculpture, but only worked full time on the project after his retirement in 1980. Kornegay gave several names to his visionary environment including The New Jerusalem, Seven Holy Mountains, Art Hill, and the Sacred Mountain. He had been inspired to create the work after a dream in which a vision from God told him that he would be better able to communicate his religious messages this way.Reverend George Kornegay ‚Äî Shrine: Reverend George Kornegay ‚Äî Shrine, accessdate: March 10, 2017 Kornegay had originally intended to sculpt a face onto a red rock but he felt compelled not to and was told to \\"Say, Upon this rock I'll build my church the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I'll give you the key to the kingdom but what you find on earth shall he found in heaven, what you loosen on earth shall he loose in heaven, and this was my beginning. I love this because this is the beginning, and all of this is going to have an end\\". Having only intended to sculpt the rock, Kornegay was told by God to \\"Go further\\" and he asked God to \\"Tell me how when I get up in the morning\\". The next day he was compelled to \\"Put a piece here, put a piece there, put a piece over yonder. Go back and get that; never throw nothing away...So I fixed it up his way. I spaced it, you know, with the eye God give me. Everything got a place. I told them, \\"I can see more with my eyes closed than they can see with their eyes open.\\" So God gave it to me, and I'm going to use it till I die\\". Themes in Kornegay's artwork included his Native American ancestry, African traditions, and apocalyptic Christian visions and passages from the Bible, including the Last supper and several crucifixions. Kornegay's African heritage was reflected in his creation of bottle trees and objects reminiscent of spiritual Nkisi. He was interviewed by William Arnett for Arnett's Souls Grown Deep Foundation in 1997 and 1998. Arnett made a gentleman's agreement with Kornegay for him to keep his artistic creation in situ, and not to sell to collectors. Arnett photographed the collection before its dispersal.Washington Post: Bill Arnett won‚Äôt shut up.

Attack The assailant was aboard a train when he suddenly began attacking fellow passengers with an axe. A fellow passenger managed to push him off the train, whereupon he attempted to get back on board by kicking and beating against the door. When he was unable to force the door open, he began attacking people in the central train station. Suspect The suspect, a 36-year-old man identified by authorities as being an asylum seeker from Kosovo in the former Yugoslavia, who arrived in Germany in 2009, resided in Wuppertal. Sources describe the attacker as being from Kosovo, a disputed territory formerly part of Yugoslavia. Investigators see no indication that the suspect had a terrorist background. The attacker fled the scene, then jumped from a nearby bridge while attempting to escape capture, injuring himself when he jumped. He was injured too severely to permit authorities to question him in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Police describe the attacker as a 2009 asylum seeker from Kosovo who suffers from a \\"psychological disorder.\\" In October 2017, the perpetrator was declared incapable by court.

History The Cannon 102/35 Model 1914 was a licensed variant of a British design from the Schneider company. These guns had hand elevation and traverse, had either vertical or horizontal semi-automatic sliding breech block mechanisms and used fixed quick fire ammunition. The naval version was produced in four different models, manufactured by Ansaldo or Vickers and was mounted on three different types of mount. :102/35 variants: :* Schneider Model 1914 - Single pedestal mount, left hand traverse & elevation and semi- automatic breech. :* Schneider-Ansaldo Model 1914 - Single pedestal mount, right hand traverse & elevation and semi-automatic breech. :* Schneider- Ansaldo-Vickers Model 1914-1915 - Single mount, center pivot, semi-automatic breech, with elevation increased to 80¬∞. :* Vickers-Terni Model 1915 - Dual- purpose, single mount, with semi-automatic breech. = Naval Use = The 102/35 armed many classes of destroyers of the Royal Italian Navy produced during and immediately after World War I, as well as some classes of submarine. As early as World War I the Cannon 102/35 was in the process of being replaced by the 102/45 or the later 120/45. However the 102/35 stayed on in a number of different roles in navy and army service until World War II. Ship classes that carried the 102/35 include: =World War I - Land Use= Before Italy‚Äôs entry into World War I in 1915, Ansaldo offered to provide the Royal Italian Army with forty seven 102/35 guns originally earmarked for installation on destroyers. These were fitted with large shields and mounted on SPA 9000 truck chassis and were known as 102/35 on SPA 9000. The Army urgently needed mobile heavy field artillery and these were the first truck- mounted field artillery of the Italian Army. The total number of guns produced was 99‚Äì105 and these armed sixteen mobile batteries during World War I. These proved effective in operations against Austro-Hungarian forces, however in 1919 the guns were removed from the trucks and are believed to have been returned to the navy. = World War II - Land Use = When Italy entered World War II in 1940 it was estimated that one hundred ten 102/35 guns were still in service. Six were mounted on a navy armored train, which had two carriages each armed with three guns. While others were mounted on anti-aircraft mounts or used as coastal artillery. In 1941 the Fiat plant in Tripoli mounted seven on trucks and were referred to as 102/35 su Fiat 634N. The guns came from defenses around Tripoli and these established the 1st and 6th mobile batteries, manned by men of the Maritime Militia Artillery. The 102/35 guns were used as anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank guns and as field-artillery. The 1st mobile battery was assigned to the 132nd Armoured Division Ariete, while the 6th mobile battery was assigned to the 102nd Motorised Division Trento. A few guns were also used by Romania, forming an anti-aircraft battery near the port of Constan»õa. The battery took part in the Raid on Constan»õa, the main naval battle in the Black Sea during the War, managing to shoot down six Soviet aircraft.Adrian Storea, Gheorghe BƒÉjenaru, Artileria rom√¢nƒÉ √Æn date »ôi imagini (Romanian artillery in data and pictures), p. 110 (in Romanian) Photo Gallery File:HN-INS-Hagana-K-20-Italian-102mm-gun-3.jpg102/35 on central pivot mount File:SPA 9000 preda bellica 01.jpg102/35 on SPA9000 captured by the Austrians in WWI File:SPA 9000 preda bellica.jpg102/35 on SPA9000 captured by the Austrians in WWI Notes  Bibliography   http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNIT_4-35_m1914.php 100 mm artillery World War I naval weapons World War II naval weapons World War I artillery of Italy World War II artillery of Italy Naval guns of Italy ","title":"Cannon 102/35 Model 1914"},{"id":"53436667","text":"Luke M.

She first went to the Soviet Union, where she had a brief relationship with Walter Duranty, then to France, and on to Barcelona. This was during the Spanish Civil War, and she met Tom Wintringham, representative of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in the city. Wintringham taught Bowler journalism skills, while Bowler assisted him by delivering messages and acting as his unofficial secretary. The two fell in love, but Wintringham was already married, and the CPGB disapproved of Bowler as she was not a communist, and they considered her to be unreliable.Hugh Pucell & Phyll Smith, The Last English Revolutionary Bowler claimed that, when she delivered a message from Wintringham to London, she asked that they recall Wintringham, but Harry Pollitt, leader of the CPGB, responded by saying he should \\"go up to the front line, get himself killed to give us a headline\\".Valentine Cunningham, The Penguin book of Spanish Civil War verse, p.42 Bowler returned to Spain and took on various journalistic assignments, sharing a hotel room in Valencia with Kate Mangan, who at that time was working in the Government Press Office.The Good Comrade, Memoirs of Kate Mangan and Jan Kurzke, International Institute of Social History (IISH), Amsterdam However, early in 1937, she was detained on the orders of Andr√© Marty on suspicion of being a spy, and expelled from the country. Wintringham was shot in the leg the following month, and she was allowed back into Spain to help nurse him. However, the CPGB ordered Wintringham to stop associating with Bowler, and in July she was again expelled from Spain, on this occasion returning to the United States. Wintringham recovered from his injury, but was shot again in August, and was sent back to the UK to receive treatment. Once he had recovered, the couple set up home together in London, leading to Wintringham's expulsion from the CPGB. They married in 1941, once Wintringham's divorce was complete. Kitty worked as a journalist in the UK. She and Tom joined the left- wing 1941 Committee and were founders of its successor, the Common Wealth Party. However, Kitty strongly disagreed with leading member Richard Acland over his advocacy of Christianity. She stood for the party in Midlothian and Peebles Northern at the 1945 UK general election, but took only 6.4% of the votes cast. Vincent Geoghegan considers this to be the only seat where the party put up a candidate against Labour and affected the final result, although this meant that the Conservatives won the seat.Vincent Geoghegan, Socialism and Religion: Roads to Common Wealth, p.180 After World War II, Kitty gave birth to a child, Benjamin, and focused on bringing him up. Tom died suddenly in 1949 and, a few years later, Kitty moved to Hawaii, but she later returned to the UK. She committed suicide in 1966.

The galaxy was discovered on 3 October 1897 by the American astronomer Lewis A. Swift. It is estimated to be around 60 to 70 million light years (20 megaparsecs) away, in the Fornax Cluster. The galaxy is one of the smaller in the Fornax cluster, with a diameter of only 35 000 light-years. IC 2006 is an early-type galaxy with a Hubble classification of E1, but has also been listed as a lenticular galaxy with a morphological type of SA0‚àí. Despite their name, early-type galaxies are much older than spiral galaxies, and mostly comprise old, red- colored stars. Very little star formation occurs in these galaxies; the lack of star formation in elliptical galaxies appears to start at the center and then slowly propagates outward. Its age is estimated to be 8.1 ¬± 1.7 billion years. An image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2015 shows a characteristically smooth profile, with no spiral arms. However, IC 2006 has a ring surrounding it. The ring appears to rotate in a direction opposite to the rest of the body, but this may be explained by a polar ring with an elliptical shape.

With an apparent magnitude of about 6.5, it is at the limit of human eyesight and is just barely visible to the naked eye. Trigonometric parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos spacecraft put it at a distance of about 690 light years (210 parsecs); this is in close agreement with the dynamical parallax value of . 65 Ursae Majoris is a sextuple star system. It contains six stars in a hierarchical orbit where each star orbits the central system. Such systems are fairly uncommon, with only a few sextuple stars known. Higher-multiplicity star systems are uncommon because they are less stable than their simpler counterparts, and often decay into smaller systems. Multiplicity Hierarchy of orbits in the 65 Ursae Majoris system The central pair of stars are both A-type main-sequence stars. These are relatively bright, white-colored stars that typically have masses from to . 65 Ursae Majoris Aa1 and Aa2 both have relatively low masses for an A-type main sequence star and have spectral types of A7V. Both components periodically pass in front of each other while orbiting, so they form an eclipsing binary with the variable star designation DN Ursae Majoris. Therefore, the apparent magnitude of the system varies between 6.6 and 6.7 magnitudes. Its orbital period of 1.73 days. The eclipsing binary pair 65 Ursae Majoris Aa is orbited by another star, designated 65 Ursae Majoris Ab. It is a spectroscopic binary: while the pair cannot be resolved, periodic Doppler shifts in their spectra indicate that there must be orbital motion. 65 Ursae Majoris orbits the inner pair with a period of 641 days (1.76 years) and an eccentricity of 0.169. 65 Ursae Majoris B orbits the three every 118 years. It is separated from the triple by 0.18‚Ä≥, and an astrometric orbit has been calculated. 65 Ursae Majoris C and D are common proper motion companions and are separated 4‚Ä≥ and 63‚Ä≥ away from the central system, respectively. 65 Ursae Majoris D also appears to be a chemically peculiar star with higher amounts of chromium, strontium, and europium than normal. Because of its unusual composition, determination of its stellar parameters is difficult; the effective temperature of this star may be 9300 or 9500 K, with the radius and the surface gravity of the star depending on the effective temperature.

He fought with Bohemond's army in the First Crusade, not returning home until after 1099. Ilger was related in some way to Roger Bigod, sheriff of Norfolk, whose son William was a victim of the White Ship disaster. He is reputed to have found a relic of the hair of Mary, mother of Christ. After the Crusaders took the city of Jerusalem, the Christian Armenians, Greeks and Syrians who had been under Turkish rule fled to the sanctuary of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Tancred, respecting their religion, assured them that they would not be harmed, and appointed Ilger, the commander of 200 knights, guardian of the holy place. The native Christians confided in Ilger and guided him and his companions to the Lord's sepulchre and other sacred places. There, they showed them sacred relics that they and their ancestors had long kept hidden. Ilger then found there a small ball of hair reputed to be of that of the Virgin Mary. Upon his return to France, Ilger shared his sacred relic among various bishoprics and monasteries. He gave two hairs to the monk Arnold of Chartres who displayed them in the church of Maule. Legend has it that many of the sick were cured through contact with the hairs. According to Roman Catholic Saints, the relic of Mary is housed in an 18th century reliquary in the Holy House of Nazareth, bearing the personal seal of Pope Pius VI. The reliquary is venerated in St. Mark‚Äôs Basilica in Venice.

It has a single hairy leaf and one or two relatively large creamy-white to pale yellow flowers. It is relatively common in moist soil around granite outcrops, growing in more inland areas than most other spider orchids. Description Caladenia remota subsp. remota is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. One or two cream-coloured to creamy- yellow flowers long and wide are borne on a spike tall. The sepals and petals have long, brown, thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long and wide, spread apart and turned downwards. The petals are long and wide and spread horizontally near their bases but then turn downwards. The labellum is long, wide and cream coloured with red lines and marks. The sides of the labellum have many short blunt teeth, the tip curls under and there are two rows of anvil-shaped, white calli, sometimes with red tips, along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to mid December. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia remota was first described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown and the description was published in Nuytsia. At the same time they described two subspecies, including subspecies remota. The specific epithet (remota) is a Latin word meaning \\"distant\\" or \\"far off\\" referring to the more inland distribution of this species of orchid. Distribution and habitat The outback spider orchid is found between Yalgoo and Bonnie Rock in the Avon Wheatbelt, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions where it usually grows in moist areas around the edges of granite outcrops.

It has a single hairy leaf and up to three creamy-white to pale yellow flowers. It has a more restricted and more westerly distribution than subspecies remota. Description Caladenia remota subsp. parva is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and wide. Up to three cream-coloured to creamy-yellow flowers long and wide are borne on a spike tall. The sepals and petals have long, brown, thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal is erect and the lateral sepals spread apart and turned downwards. The petals spread horizontally near their bases but then turn downwards. The labellum is long, wide and cream coloured with red lines and marks. The sides of the labellum have many short blunt teeth, the tip curls under and there are two rows of anvil-shaped, white calli, sometimes with red tips, along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to mid-September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia remota was first described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown and the description was published in Nuytsia. At the same time they described two subspecies, including subspecies parva. The subspecies name (parva) is a Latin word meaning \\"little\\" referring to the smaller size of this subspecies compared to subspecies remota. Distribution and habitat The Perenjori spider orchid is found between Perenjori and Wubin in the Avon Wheatbelt and Yalgoo biogeographic regions where it usually grows in shrublands that are wet in winter.

Its initial membership consisted of former presidents of the American Library Association (ALA) and other library professionals who had achieved notoriety which had been recognized by their peers.  History  = Formation = A pioneer in American librarianship and an influential figure in the development of libraries in America in the late 19th and early the 20th century, Melvil Dewey played a major role in the establishment of both the American Library Association and the National Association of State Libraries. In 1904, concerned about the size of the ALA, Dewey felt the need to establish a small library league or academy which would undertake the study of librarianship in the form of small meetings and discussions. This scholarly focus, in Dewey's opinion, was no longer practical under the growing membership of the ALA. The mandate of this new institution would be thought leadership and the formation and clarification of opinions relating to library issues. The resulting findings and recommendations were then to be published. The option and responsibility to take any specific actions resulting from these findings, fell to the ALA. A proposal was presented to the ALA council in late 1904 and a committee of five was appointed to study the formation of the proposed academy. In July 1905, at a conference in Portland, OR, the ALA voted to establish the American Library Institute. While the proposed organization would not be under the formal control of the ALA, a committee was formed consisting of 15 former ALA presidents with a mandate to draft a constitution and by-laws and to develop a plan to launch the American Library Institute. = Membership = * Recognized library leaders and thinkers from English speaking America * Former presidents of the American Library Association * Not to exceed one hundred persons = Governing structure = * President (Board Chairman) - 2-year term * Secretary-Treasurer - 2-year term * Board of five members - 5-year term * Members of ALA executive board to have seats at council * Two meetings per year First board included Melvil Dewey, President; Henry James Carr, Secretary-Treasurer; and James Hulme Canfield, Frederick M.

Records of later meetings show personal opinion and preference entering into the decision making of the institute. Subsequently, by the end of the 1930s, the institute had become not much more than a debating society for retired librarians. During the second world war there was little activity within the organization and annual meetings were suspended in 1942. A single meeting was held in 1949 to vote on the issue of dissolution of the institute. The vote was finalized the following year and remaining funds were transferred to the American Library Association in early 1951.

Biography  Pieter Simon Hamel was born in Breskens in the province of Zeeland, the Netherlands, to Simon Hamel and Catharina Callandt. After gaining his teaching qualifications, he worked as a teacher in Dordrecht and Groede. In 1869, Hamel's adventurous nature led him to write his acquaintance Frederik Nagtglas, brother of Dutch Gold Coast governor Cornelis Nagtglas, to ask whether he could inquire with his brother if he could be appointed as a teacher in Elmina. Hamel was then promptly appointed as an assistant teacher at the government school in Elmina and arrived at the latter place on 13 July 1869. Adventure rather than a passion for teaching was the primary motivation for Hamel to seek an appointment at Elmina, and governor Nagtglas, who quickly noticed that Hamel's talents could well be used elsewhere, soon gave him responsibility for the post office that was just established at Elmina as a consequence of the entry into force of the Anglo-Dutch Convention for an Interchange of Territory on the Gold Coast of Africa. Hamel was also made cashier and assistant to the bookkeeper. In the years after, he was among other things charged with performing religious services and installed as head of the tax office, as the keeper of civil records, as a translator, and as a substitute judge. = Start of a diplomatic career = After the Netherlands sold their possessions on the Gold Coast to the United Kingdom in April 1872, Hamel was employed at the consulate that the Netherlands had established at Elmina. Hamel first was appointed vice consul under consul Willem Le Jeune in 1873, before becoming acting consul on 15 March 1874, upon Le Jeune's return to the Netherlands. In May 1875, Hamel was subsequently installed as full Consul. On 5 June 1876, Hamel paid the kostgeld still due to Asantehene Mensa Bonsu for the final years of Dutch presence in Elmina. Following a European leave between November 1877 to March 1878, Hamel returned to Elmina and was awarded the personal title of Consul General. The Netherlands had decided to keep a diplomatic post at Elmina primarily for the payment of pensions to the retired recruits of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. Other reasons included the safeguarding of Dutch trade interests and the exploration of the possibility to continue recruiting soldiers for the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in Africa. Hamel especially went at great lengths in trying to negotiate a deal with an African head to recruit these soldiers: after the British abolished slavery in the Gold Coast in 1874, slaves could no longer be manumitted by the Dutch government in return for an army contract, leading Hamel to try his luck in Dahomey, Grand Bassam and Assini, which stood under French protection. Hamel undertook a mission to Krindjabo, the capital of the Kingdom of Sanwi in contemporary C√¥te d'Ivoire, in which he found King Amatifou sympathetic to his proposal, but unwilling to do anything without the blessing of the French. France, however, did not allow this recruitment to take place. Upon his return from European leave, Hamel tried to negotiate a deal in Liberia, an independent country not under the protection of either France or the United Kingdom, to no avail. The Consulate General at Elmina was disbanded in February 1880. Hamel subsequently appointed Arthur Brun as honorary consul at Elmina and left the Gold Coast. = Consul General at Bangkok = Hamel was then appointed Consul General at Bangkok, where he had to take over a badly functioning consulate that was previously headed by Consul J. Salmon, who had to leave his post after suffering from a nervous breakdown. Hamel reduced the workload of the consulate by limiting the number of Chinese-Dutch citizens under its protection. On the instigation of Hamel, the consulate was upgraded to a consulate general, primarily because of the trade links of Siam with the Dutch East Indies. In June 1887, Hamel was forced to leave his post because of failing health. = Consul General at Amoy = After three years in the Netherlands, Hamel was appointed Consul General at Amoy for Southern China and Formosa in 1890. Hamel's main task was to secure the unimpeded migration of Chinese labourers from the Southern Chinese cities to the Dutch East Indies and the other Dutch colonies. Coincidentally, the Consul General in Beijing, Hamel's direct superior, was the former Gold Coast governor Jan Helenus Ferguson. While in Amoy, Hamel suffered two strokes, which forced him to retire. Hamel was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Bendorf am Rhein in Germany where he died on 13 October 1900.  Personal life  On the Gold Coast, Hamel had a relationship with Ellen Vickermann, with whom had a son named George Hamel. George Hamel would eventually follow his father's footsteps and also become a diplomat. In the Netherlands, Hamel married Maria Margaretha den Bouwmeester on 14 November 1881 in Singapore. Maria joined Hamel in Bangkok and gave birth there to a daughter named Maria Elisabeth Hamel on 30 December 1882. Maria Margaretha den Bouwmeester died in Bangkok on 20 November 1884, leaving Pieter Simon Hamel devastated.

She is the Gabrielle H. Reem and Herbert J. Kayden Associate Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Neurophysiology and Behavior at The Rockefeller University. Ruta is a 2019 MacArthur Fellow. She was one of the six fellows from New York City. Education and scientific career Ruta graduated summa cum laude from Hunter College in Chemistry in 2000. She went on to perform doctoral research in the laboratory of Rod Mackinnon, earning her Ph.D. in Biology from The Rockefeller University in 2005. In Mackinnon's lab, she played a critical role in solving the structure of the voltage-dependent potassium ion channel. Her graduate work investigated the structural biology and function of potassium channels. These deeply conserved proteins conduct ions across biological membranes and are targets of toxin including those produced by the tarantula. Vanessa worked out the mechanism by which spider toxins bind the voltage sensor domain of potassium channels. As a postdoctoral fellow with Richard Axel at Columbia University, Ruta switched fields to the analysis of how the brain encodes both innate and learned stimuli and discovered a sexually dimorphic circuit that drives male fly responses to a pheromone, and traced the activity of the circuit from the periphery to the motor output. She joined the faculty at The Rockefeller University in 2011. Career In work that bridged her postdoc and the establishment of her own independent group her at Rockefeller University, Ruta demonstrated that the mushroom body encodes information using a rewriteable random access memory architecture. Her lab has elucidated brain circuits that control male fly responses to female pheromones, demonstrated that the memory center of the fly brain uses compartmentalized dopamine modulation to encode behaviors, described the evolution of central neural circuits underlying courtship decisions in Drosophila and solved the structure of the invertebrate olfactory receptor co-receptor (Orco). Her work on the structure of insect odorant receptors‚Äîa potential target for new insect repellents‚Äîhas been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

It is the first amphibian named after David Attenborough. It was discovered by Edgar Lehr and Rudolf von May during a period of two years of studying the forests of Peru. The species description was based on 34 specimens caught at elevations of above sea level.  Description  Male of Pristimantis attenboroughi (lateral view) Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is short and rounded. No tympanum is present. The finger and toe tips are narrow and rounded, without circumferential grooves; neither lateral fringes nor webbing is present. The dorsal coloration ranges from pale gray to reddish brown to brownish olive. There are scattered flecks and sometimes an X-shaped scapular mark. Most specimens have dark grayish-brown canthal and supratympanic stripes. Juveniles are paler in coloration, yellowish to reddish brown, bearing contrasting dark brown flecks and distinct canthal and supratympanic stripes. Reproduction occurs by direct development, that is, there is no free-living tadpole stage. The average egg diameter is . Habitat and conservation Pristimantis attenboroughi is known from upper montane forests and high Andean grasslands at above sea level where specimens were found living inside moss pads. A female was found guarding a clutch of 20 eggs inside moss. Although this species could qualify as \\"endangered\\" or \\"vulnerable\\" because of its small range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed it in 2018 as \\"near threatened\\". The category was chosen because the overall population is believed to be stable, the species is common, and much of the known range is within a protected area.

Life =Child prodigy and royal teacher= Giorgetti, a child prodigy, started studying violin with Giovanni Francesco Giuliani at five years old and continued on this path for 9 years. However, nothing is known regarding his education of composition, so it is most probable that he was self-taught. The publications from that time mention him as the private violin instructor of Carlo II of Borbone-Parma, but no specific dates are given. Rumors originate from the fact that Giorgetti, in 1840, dedicated a complex sacred oratorio for choir and a large orchestra, Le turbe nel deserto, to Carlo II. The frontispiece of the autograph (today found in Parma, see Sources) affirm being given to the prince ¬´i primi elementi di musica e restommi scolpito mai sempre nel cuore¬ª (¬´I gave the Prince his first education in music, and he remained struck in my heart¬ª). Research into the lives of both of them indicates that it is probable that the dates of their lessons were 1808, so, if this is in fact true, twelve-year-old Giorgetti taught the 9-year-old prince.Claudio Paradiso, La vita e l'opera, in Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Il cavalier Ferdinando Giorgetti musicista romantico a Firenze, Roma, Societ√† Editrice di Musicologia, 2015, pp. 17-79. =First soloist experiences and paralysis= In 1811, Elisa Bonaparte hired him as her personal violinist (¬´Chamber Violin of the Queen of Etruria¬ª), and he traveled with her in Spain and France until 1814, the year in which two central occurrences took place in his life: the fall of Napoleon and the contraction of a mysterious disease affecting his nervous system which left him paralyzed from the hips down.A condition of disability that some scholars observed to be perfectly contemporary to that of Giacomo Leopardi. See Marcello De Angelis, Introduzione to Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Il cavalier Ferdinando Giorgetti musicista romantico a Firenze, Roma, Societ√† Editrice di Musicologia, 2015, pp. 9-17. Because of the loss of his job, and above all, his paralysis, he was forced to leave his career as a soloist and dedicate his efforts to composition, teaching, musical publicity, and the organization of events and performances. =First success as a composer= It was from that moment in his life that he perfected counterpoint with Disma Ugolini (1755-1828)[1], learning the methods in practice, derived from the experienced didactics of Antonin Reicha, who was a classmate of Beethoven and teacher of not only Ugolini, but also Franck, Adam, Berlioz and Liszt. In 1817, despite his paralysis, he traveled to Germany to publish his compositions in Leipzig, at Breitkopf & H√§rtel publishers (their relation lasted until 1825). In 1818, he composed a concerto for flute, extraordinarily and curiously similar to the second concerto that Saverio Mercadante wrote for the same instrument in 1819. In 1825, he won (tied with Luigi Ferdinando Casamorata) a competition by the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze centered around the putting to music of the cantata Il Ciclope by Pietro Metastasio. =Publicist and Fame: the union between German tradition and Italian singability= Commemorative plaque placed on the Giorgetti‚Äôs villa located at Via Ricasoli 47 in Florence, in front of the entrance to the Galleria dell'Accademia. In 1828, the fame of Giorgetti as a composer, teacher, and publicist was established in Florence because he most furiously participated in a written debate regarding German influence in the didactics of Italian music. In the periodicals, space was given to the prevalent idea that there was an excessive penetration of German taste inside the classrooms of the conservatories, while Giorgetti, on the contrary, affirmed that the study of Germans of the Classical period (Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven) was instead essential in acquiring the necessary knowledge that permitted Italian singability to be expressed well. Giorgetti proposed a sort of union between German and Italian style, which in this era were considered to be incompatible. He pointed to Gioachino Rossini as the ultimate example of that union. Rossini was taught through German examples during his education in Bologna; indeed, he was given the nickname ‚Äú\\"il tedeschino\\" (the little German). Giorgetti was given the nickname ‚Äúil tedescone\\" (the big German) for his fondness of Teutonic artistry. That fondness found fertile ground in the Germanophile Tuscany, ruled by Habsburg- Lorraine.Marcello De Angelis, Firenze - Vienna. Un magico incontro, in Antonio Carlini (ed.), Accademie e Societ√† Filarmoniche. Organizzazione, cultura e attivit√† dei filarmonici nell'Italia dell'Ottocento.

In 1827, on the frontispiece of Tre trj di una difficolt√† progressiva (dedicated to Paganini) he indicates ¬´first violin of the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany¬ª, and thanks to the support of the court (members to which Giorgetti dedicated numerous compositions), he began promoting instrumental music and cultured European musical language, an activity to which he dedicated all of his energy as a composer, teacher and orchestral conductor. =Preference for the quartet= The quartet was a privileged object of interest in his work, and was, at that time, used infrequently by Italian composers. He considered the quartet to be the maximum expression of the art of music (and believes to be heir of the great European approach to the quartet, which at the time a myth considered created in ItalyIn the 1800s the nationalistic certainty that the quartet was invented by the following Italians, Giuseppe Cambini, Filippo Manfredi, Luigi Boccherini and Pietro Nardini circulated. A conviction fed by the fact that one of the first to ever speak about the quartet, in a written text, both regarding formation and genre, was Giuseppe Cambini in 1804. This belief was considered to be truth for a long time, but today, given the difficulty in proving so, was put into perspective by historians. On this topic see Dieter Lutz Trimpert, Die Quatuors concertants von Giuseppe Cambini, Tutzing (Baviera), Schneider, 1967; Chappell White, Jean Gribenski, Amzie D. Parcell, Cambini, Giuseppe Maria (Gioacchino), in The New Grove of Music and Musicians.

He promoted many performances of quartets (often for their first Italian performance Paolo Paolini, Beethoven a Firenze nell'Ottocento, in ¬´Nuova rivista musicale italiana¬ª, V/5 (1971) e V/6 (1971), Torino, ERI, 1971, pp. 753-787 e pp. 973-1002.), as well as for private events organized by Giorgetti himself, which were often held at his house (in Via Ricasoli in Florence). In addition, he created incentives for popularized the genre with arrangements from the great German quartets, and he himself composed eight string quartets.Ennio Speranza, Una pianta fuori di clima. Il quartetto per archi in Italia da Verdi a Casella, Torino, EDT, 2013.Ennio Speranza, Il cavaliere del quartetto, in Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Il cavalier Ferdinando Giorgetti musicista romantico a Firenze, Roma, Societ√† Editrice di Musicologia, 2015, pp. 125-134.Sergio Martinotti, Ottocento strumentale italiano, Bologna, Forni, 1972. However, Giorgetti didn‚Äôt disregard other genres of instrumental and symphonic music,Antonio Rostagno, La sinfonia italiana nel periodo di Rossini. Comportamenti, teoria e pratica, in Antonio Carlini (ed.), Accademie e Societ√† Filarmoniche in Italia. Studi e ricerche, Trento, Filarchiv/Societ√† Filarmonica di Trento, 2003, pp. 203-275. and like many orchestral conductors (one of the last ‚Äúdirector-violinists‚Äù, before becoming solely a conductor like Teodulo Mabellini, his compatriot and contemporary, and Angelo Mariani), performed sacred masterpieces by Haydn and Rossini in Florence in order to demonstrate that a same substance connected both German and Italian tradition. In addiction, Giorgetti rediscovered numerous composers of the past. =Affinity to other composers= His commitment gained favor of many composers, from Louis Spohr to Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis, from Antonio BazziniSome letters from Bazzini to Giorgetti are preserved in the Ricordi Archive in Milan, where they have been digitalized. They are available on Internet Culturale . See also Claudio Sartori, L'avventura del violino. L'Italia musicale dell'Ottocento nella biografia e nei carteggi di Antonio Bazzini, Torino, ERI, 1978. to Giovanni Pacini, to Giuseppe Poniatowski, to whom Giorgetti dedicated works and offered hospitality in his villa in Via Ricasoli. He maintained sincere friendships with Niccol√≤ Paganini, for whom he composed many pieces for violin, with Franz Liszt, who he met in Florence in 1838Gregorio Nardi, ¬´Mon cher monsieur Giorgetti¬ª: l'incontro con Franz Liszt a Firenze nel 1838, in Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Il cavalier Ferdinando Giorgetti musicista romantico a Firenze, Roma, Societ√† Editrice di Musicologia, 2015, pp. 81-103 and, above all, with Gioacchino Rossini. When he was a guest of Giorgetti‚Äôs in Florence, Rossini was at the mercy of his depression and nervous crises, which Giorgetti tried to help remedy by showing Rossini his own greater suffering caused by his paralysis.Mario Fabbri, Ignoti momenti rossiniani: le segrete confessioni a Ferdinando Giorgetti e le sconosciute variazioni per Alessandro Abate (1817), in ¬´Chigiana¬ª, vol. XXV, serie 5 (1968), Firenze, Olschki, 1968, pp. 265-285. Sui rapporti tra i due vedi anche Franco Schlitzer, Contributi all'epistolario rossiniano: giudizio sopra un sestetto di Ferdinando Giorgetti, in ¬´Bollettino del Centro rossiniano di studi¬ª, 2 (1956), Pesaro, Fondazione Rossini, 1956, pp. 29 ssgg. =Refusal of opera= The national tendency of the public, however, remained that of developing a passion for lyric opera instead of for instrumental music, which was a fact that threw Giorgetti into a rage. He stigmatized the exaggerated patronage of opera of his compatriots, and believed that the young Giuseppe Verdi was a corruptor of Italian musical traditions, and that Ricordi publishers was a guilty accomplice (in 1856 Giorgetti also interrupted his fine and at that point good relations with the Milanese publisher because of his operatic inclination). =Teaching= He continued to promote instrumental music throughout his life, both as a teacher and as a publicist. Some of his students were Luigi Bicchierai, Luigi Laschi, Carlo Verardi and Jefte Sbolci, to whom he dedicated many studies and for whom he wrote a few methods (the most famous is the method for viola written in 1854, and then printed again by Ricordi in 1902).Franco Sciannameo, Riflessioni sul ¬´Metodo per esercitarsi a ben suonare l'alto-viola¬ª, in Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Il cavalier Ferdinando Giorgetti musicista romantico a Firenze, Roma, Societ√† Editrice di Musicologia, 2015, pp. 105-124. =The Rivista Musicale of Florence: influence on Basevi= In 1840, he founded the ¬´Rivista Musicale di Firenze¬ª (Musical Magazine of Florence), which was the first Italian periodical completely dedicated to music. He didn‚Äôt write critiques, but rather philosophical reflections of music, very similar to those of Giuseppe Mazzini expressed in Filosofia della musica (Philosophy of music) in 1836. Giorgetti‚Äôs opinions very much inspired the ideas of Abramo Basevi,Ugo Piovano, Giorgetti nelle riviste musicali fiorentine, in Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Il cavalier Ferdinando Giorgetti musicista romantico a Firenze, Roma, Societ√† Editrice di Musicologia, 2015, pp. 157-202. one of the protagonists in the Florentine musical scene. Together, Giorgetti and Basevi created large instrumental organizations, among which were Mattinate beethoveniane (concerts that brought the Tuscan reception of Beethoven to the forefront and which were first performed in front of his house in Via Ricasoli, in 1859, and then at the Lemonnier Institute in via S. Egidio), Concerti popolari (created by Basevi and Teodulo Mabellini in 1863), and Societ√† del quartetto (with the publisher Giovanni Gualberto Guidi), which in 1861 finally made Giorgetti‚Äôs dream of having a Florentine ‚Äúhouse‚Äù for the quartet come true. In fact, he dedicated his last Settimo quartetto to the Societ√†.Bianca Maria Antolini, La musica in Toscana nell'Ottocento, in Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Teodulo Mabellini. Il protagonista dell'Ottocento musicale toscano, Pistoia, Brigata del Leoncino, 2005, pp. 19-35.Societ√† del quartetto of Basevi and Guidi rendered Florence a sort of capital for Italian instrumental music, and we don‚Äôt know exactly how much Giorgetti appreciated it after his initial enthusiasm. A student of Giorgetti, Jefte Sbolci, founded a similar association, the Societ√† fiorentina del quartetto (Florentine Quartet Society) in 1866, causing fierce competition, which greatly complicated the just barely reborn Florentine quartet. The two groups stole reporty and soloists from each other and confused the public and Florentine institutions, which were incapable of understanding two groups so similar. We don‚Äôt know how much Giorgetti, who was already quite old, participated in this diatribe. See Bianca Maria Antolini, La musica in Toscana nell'Ottocento, in Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Teodulo Mabellini, il protagonista dell'Ottocento musicale toscano, Pistoia, Brigata del Leoncino, 2005, pp. 19-35. =Last years= Getting weaker and weaker from his paralysis, he became interested in the destiny of old musicians. He donated many of his earning to institutions that offer assistance. His involvement as a teacher and publicist continued almost until his death, but he almost completely ceased to compose after 1862. He died in his house in Via Ricasoli in 1867. Works and sources 360px Giorgetti mostly composed for violin (2 concerti) and for strings (eight quartets and numerous pieces for two violins, and violin and viola), but he also dedicated his time to sacred music with messe and oratorios, and some symphonic experiments. He arranged many themes by Vincenzo Bellini, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Louis Spohr for strings. He also composed songs for soprano, as well as compositions for harp, piano, clarinet and flute (the concerto from 1818). =Autographs= The institution that preserves the greatest number of his autographs is the Conservatory Luigi Cherubini in Florence followed by the Palatina Library in Parma, and the Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels. In Brussels, at the Royal Library of Belgium, you can also find the autograph of the third quartet, which Giorgetti dedicated to F√©tis. The autograph of the Ouverture I, dated 1840 and dedicated to Poniatowski, was found by the pianist Gregorio Nardi in Florence and today is looked after in his private Florentine archive. The Pacini Collection of the Carlo Magnani Library in Pescia, and the Conservatories of Brussels and Florence all look after an autographed copy of Dies Irae, the only piece that remains of the Messa da Requiem which Giorgetti dedicated to Giovanni Pacini in 1843: on the frontispiece of these documents, there is a note from the composer which indicated how counterfeit copies are made lacking his autograph.Copies lacking Giorgetti‚Äôs signature of the same Dies Irae are in the Capitolary Archive in Pistoia, in the Biblioteca Palatina in Parma, in the Biblioteca Domenicini in Perugia and in the Sibley Music Library della Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, in New York. The Philharmonic Academy of Bologna preserves the autograph of the Gran quintetto, at one time dedicated by Giorgetti to the librarian Masseangelo Masseangeli, then published by Ricordi in 1847 and rededicated first to the students and then to Poniatowski. The Greggiati Collection in Ostiglia contains the autograph of the Ave Maria, op. 35 in a version arranged for orchestra (the autograph of the original version for piano, harp or quartet is at the Conservatory of Florence). The autograph of the seventh quartet for strings was only recently discovered at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. (Italian site) =Manuscripts= The majority of the contemporary manuscripts of his work are at the Conservatory of Florence and the Hofburgkapelle in Vienna. After which, manuscripts are found at the Noseda Collection of the Conservatory of Milan, the Capitolary Archive in Pistoia, (Italian site) the Sasso Collection at the Accademia Santa Cecilia of Rome, the Paganini Conservatory of Genoa, and Arezzo Historic Archive.In the archive of Societ√† Filarmonica Aretina are manuscripted parts of 3 Giorgetti's works: Variazioni e Rond√≤ on Bellini's themes for violin (full score printed by Stefani Litography in 1836 with attached handwritten parts), a symphony (only parts), another Variazioni e Rond√≤ for violin, clarinet and cello (only parts).

A unique contemporary copy of Giorgetti‚Äôs works are preserved at the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana in Venice, in the Greggiati Collection in Ostiglia, at the Biblioteca Statale in Cremona, at the Biblioteca Domenicini in Perugia, at the Conservatorio San Pietro a Majella in Naples, and, abroad, at the Abteilung Musik, Theater, Film della Universit√§tsbibliothek ¬´Johann Christian Senckenberg¬ª in Frankfurt, at the Sibley Music Library part of the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester (New York), and in the Galeazzi Collection at the Irving Gilmore Music Library at Yale University in New Haven (Connecticut). =Printed editions= The greatest number of first editions printed with the works of Giorgetti are at the Conservatory in Florence. Given Giorgetti‚Äôs longlasting relationship with Ricordi, many first editions of his works are also in Milan, at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory.The Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana in Venice preserves 12 first editions of his. Following, by number of examples, are: the Greggiati Collection in Ostiglia, the Institute of music Vecchi & Tonelli in Modena, the Accademia Santa Cecilia in Rome, the Conservatory of Naples, the Conservatory of Brescia, the Conservatory of Pesaro, the National Library in Florence, the Conservatory of Bergamo, the Biblioteca Palatina in Parma, the Conservatory of Bologna, the Conservatory of Perugia, the Conservatory of Rome, the Capitolary Archive in Pistoia, the Biblioth√®que Royale de Belgique in Bruxelles, the Conservatory of Liegi, the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Monaco and the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. The following preserve only one copy of a first edition of an opera: the Conservatory in Verona, the Accademia Filarmonica in Bologna, the Biblioteca Aurelio Saffi in Forl√¨, the Scuola di Musica di Fiesole, the Accademia Chigiana in Siena, the Historic Archive of Arezzo, the Biblioteca di Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte di Palazzo Venezia in Rome, the private archive of Claudio Paradiso in Latina, the Library of the University of Reading (England), the Liszt Ferenc Zenem√ºv√©szeti F√∂iskola K√∂nivt√°ra in Budapest, the Music Division of the Public Library in Lincoln Center in New York, and the Sibley Music Library in Rochester. The first edition from 1856 of his methods for viola is preserved at the Conservatories in Milan, Florence, Bergamo and Rome, at the Biblioteca Comunale in Finale Emilia and at the British Library in London. Discography In 1968, the group Sestetto Chigiano d'Archi (Riccardo Brengola, Giovanni Guglielmo, violins; Tito Riccardi, Mario Benvenuti, violas; Alain Meunier, Franco Petracchi, cellos) performed Sestetto n. 3, op. 25 by Georgetti (dedicated to Rossini and printed in Florence by Guidi in 1845; autograph conserved in Conservatoire de Musique de Bruxelles) in the concert hall of Palazzo Chigi-Saracini in Siena, during the local Musical Week. Performance was recorded and the original tape is conserved in the Italian National Discography Institute in Rome. The Institute published the recording in 1989, and now is available on-line on the official site. References Further reading * Eleuterio Pantologo, La musica italiana del XIX secolo.

Elimination is the most effective of the five members of the hierarchy of hazard controls in protecting workers, and where possible should be implemented before all other control methods. Many jurisdictions require that an employer eliminate hazards if it is possible, before considering other types of hazard control. Elimination is most effective early in the design process, when it may be inexpensive and simple to implement. It is more difficult to implement for an existing process, when major changes in equipment and procedures may be required. Elimination can fail as a strategy if the hazardous process or material is reintroduced at a later stage in the design or production phases. The complete elimination of hazards is a major component to the philosophy of Prevention through Design, which promotes the practice of eliminating hazards at the earliest design stages of a project. Complete elimination of a hazard is often the most difficult control to achieve, but addressing it at the start of a project allows designers and planners to make large changes much more easily without the need to retrofit or redo work.  Typical examples  Removing the use of a hazardous chemical is an example of elimination. Some substances are difficult or impossible to eliminate because they have unique properties necessary to the process, but it may be possible to instead substitute less hazardous versions of the substance. Elimination also applies to equipment as well. For example, noisy equipment can be removed from a room used for other purposes, or an unnecessary blade can be removed from a machine. Prompt repair of damaged equipment eliminates hazards stemming from their malfunction. Elimination also applies to processes. For example, the risk of falls can be eliminated by eliminating the process of working in a high area, by using extending tools from the ground instead of climbing, or moving a piece to be worked on to ground level. The need for workers to enter a hazardous area such as a grain elevator can be eliminated by installing equipment that performs the task automatically. Eliminating an inspection that requires opening a package containing a hazardous material reduces the inhalation hazard to the inspector.

It is integrated in a big block, which also includes the Taller del Moro and the Iglesia de Santo Tom√©, which forms the north fa√ßade of the Plaza del Conde. The first Count of Fuensalida, Pedro L√≥pez de Ayala, carved this house towards 1440 for the mayorazgos of this title, of which was founder. This first Count of Fuensalida, son of the famous Chancellor L√≥pez de Ayala, was main mayor of Toledo, mayor of the fortresses of the city, and, consequently, retired mayor of the King. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, despite his pilgrimage, landed in Toledo no less than nineteen homes, and he lived in this Palace while the construction of the Alc√°zar was completed. In his letters and in its courtyard, the child who would become king, Philip II, experienced some of his childhood experiences, along with his mother, the Empress. Today, a sculpture by Pompeo Leoni representing Isabel of Portugal presides over the courtyard of Fuensalida. Legend History, sometimes, is transmuted into legend. A particular episode happened in the Palace in the absence of the Emperor: the illness and death of his wife, Do√±a Isabel of Portugal. From here departed the procession with the corpse towards Granada and the legend arises that takes body and is maintained until today. Francisco de Borja, Duke of Gand√≠a, an aulic knight, according to some, anonymously in love with the Empress, led the funeral procession, and he had to recognize Do√±a Isabel's corpse upon his arrival in the city of the Alhambra. There he opened the coffin and, after verifying the deterioration of the beauty of which it was his mistress, they say that he pronounced those proverbial words: I will not serve again to any lord that can die. That event made him change his life. He was ordained a priest and professed in the Society of Jesus, of which he was third General Superior. Then the Church made him Saint.

It came to national prominence as a political association in January 2017 after organizing a petition about the Budapest bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, calling for a public referendum on the matter. The petition, which gathered over 266 151 signatures, was successful, but the government cancelled the Olympic bid before a referendum could have been held. After its establishment as a political party, Momentum quickly built a national following, and presently has approximately 4,000 members. The opposition MP's 2019 press conference on Hungarian parliament' stairs. Momentum's activists (wearing purple jackets) are on the right side of photo. Momentum party candidates appeared on the ballot in most electoral districts in the 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election, promoting the replacement of the government of Viktor Orb√°n and advocating a new generation of political change in the country. The party obtaining 3.06% of the votes failed to reach the 5% threshold and did not get any seats in the Orsz√°ggy≈±l√©s, but is now widely considered the strongest extra-parliamentary party in Hungary, and is often involved in the organization of political events and demonstrations. In the 2019 European Parliament election in Hungary, the party obtained 9.86% and became the third largest party in the election. Two candidates of the party ‚Äì Katalin Cseh and Anna J√∫lia Don√°th ‚Äì were elected to the European Parliament.  Political positions  Momentum advocates for the replacement of the present Hungarian political elite, including the government of Viktor Orb√°n, with a \\"new breed of political community in Hungary.\\" The party is generally pro-European, pro-globalization, and anti-Putin, claiming that Hungary does not need to sacrifice its own interests in order to fulfil its commitments to the European Union. The party's social views are largely progressive in nature; it supports gay marriage, the decriminalisation of cannabis, and abortion rights. Momentum nonetheless calls itself a centrist party, and rejects classification on either side of the political spectrum. It calls for bipartisan co-operation, writing in its mission statement that Hungary \\"must not be divided by ideological battles, but brought together by common goals.\\"  History  In early 2015, the Momentum Movement group was created by ten Hungarians. On November 3, 2016, the group registered as an association, led by lawyer D√°niel K√°roly Csala. By February 2017, the association lead a drive for a referendum on Budapest's bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics: they had 143 members and 1,800 activists. On March 4, 2017, Momentum Movement became an official political party, with 99 founding members. In May 2017, pollsters estimated that the party stood at 3% national support. Most of its supporters were high school graduates under the age of 40 or college-educated urban residents. In October 2017, the party released its platform for the upcoming election (), a 363-page document proposing solutions to an array of perceived issues in the Hungarian governmental system. The critical reception to the document was mixed: one major Hungarian news outlet, the Magyar Id≈ëk, called the document a \\"pile of empty promises,\\" while another, hvg.hu, wrote that the document's proposed healthcare policy seemed \\"the most detailed and thorough.\\" In March 2018, the party announced that their parliamentary candidates would be on the ballot in 97 out of 106 electoral districts in Hungary. On April 8, 2018, the party obtained 3.08% of the popular vote in the parliamentary elections. Momentum did not meet the threshold for the party to be recognized in parliament, but qualified for government subsidies for the next term. On May 5, 2018, the president of the party resigned, and the three head directors of the party temporarily took over leadership. In April 2019, the party was registered for the 2019 European Parliament election. On May 26, 2019, the party obtained 9.86% of the popular vote (becoming the third largest party in the election), thus meeting the 5% threshold: two candidates of the party were elected to the European Parliament. In 2019 local election the party managed to win mayorships of three Budapest districts and 29 seats in counties' assemblies (mostly in Pest county).

She founded and is a leader of the controversial advocacy group, Advocates for Children in Therapy. She has been an outspoken critic of Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) therapies and is the author of several books, including Thinking critically about child development: examining myths and misunderstandings. Mercer's articles on attachment disorder, harmful psychological treatments and other mental health issues have been published in peer reviewed journals. She has presented at conferences internationally, made television appearances, served as editor for an industry newsletter, and authors two blogs, Childmyths and The Study of Nonsense. Education Mercer attended Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, from 1959 to 1961. She received a BA in psychology from Occidental College in Los Angeles, California, in 1963. In February 1968, she was awarded a Ph.D. in psychology from Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. Career From September, 1967 to June, 1969, Mercer held the position of assistant professor at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. From there, she moved to Buffalo, New York, to serve as assistant professor at State University College, a position she held for two years before taking an assistant professorship at Richard Stockton College (now Stockton University) in Pomona, New Jersey, in September 1974. Mercer remained at the college, attaining a full professorship in 1981, until her retirement in 2006. She is currently professor emerita of psychology at Stockton University. Mercer is a developmental psychologist who has spent much of her career as an advocate for evidence-based therapy techniques, particularly for children who are adopted or come from the foster care system. She is an outspoken critic of RAD therapies (also known as attachment therapy, rebirthing, compression or coercive restraint therapy) which, she says, are \\"completely contrary to mainstream medical practice\\" and are used without empirical support for their efficacy. These therapies, according to Mercer, involve techniques such as restricting food, restraining children so they can't move and forcing them to do meaningless, difficult chores as punishment, and are practiced by people who \\"mistakenly equate obedience with attachment.\\" In 2003, Mercer co-wrote Attachment Therapy on Trial: The Torture and Death of Candace Newmaker, with Larry W. Sarner and Linda A. Rosa. The book is an in- depth exploration into the suffocation of Candace Newmaker, a 10-year-old Colorado girl, during one such session. Mercer was a consulting reader for articles that appeared in the journal Infants and Young Children (1992‚Äì2000), editor for the New Jersey Association for Infant Mental Health's newsletter, The Phoenix (1994‚Äì1999), and contributor and consulting editor for the Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice, a journal published by the Center for Inquiry. Major works =Child Development: Myths and Misunderstandings= In Child Development: Myths and Misunderstandings, published by Sage, Mercer provides readers with 51 essays that challenge or dispel common misconceptions about child development, starting with infancy and moving through the teen years. Mercer makes a distinction among myths (stories we tell ourselves), mistakes (erroneous information) and misunderstandings (misinterpretation of information) that influence how people interpret research involving child development. Topics addressed in the book include: vaccination and autism, sugar and hyperactivity, punishment and changing children's behavior, high-self esteem and student achievement, Sudden infant death syndrome, and violence in video games. Mercer also discusses research findings from psychology that were current at the time the book was published, as well as \\"major gaps in knowledge\\" that needed further study. The book is intended to help readers (parents, college students) challenge assumptions rooted in their own childhood experiences and develop critical thinking skills for determining fact from conjecture. Discussion questions, provided after each exposed myth, help with this process. In its 3rd edition, the book was re-titled Thinking critically about child development: examining myths and misunderstandings. =Understanding Attachment: Parenting, Child Care, and Emotional Development= In Understanding Attachment: Parenting, Child Care, and Emotional Development, published by Praeger, Mercer provides readers with an historical overview of attachment and makes a distinction between \\"the notion of attachment in many popular theories of parenting\\" and the \\"meaning of attachment in developmental psychology.\\" Based on empirical research, Mercer offers insight into attachment issues for children of varying ages (e.g., secure-base behavior, separation anxiety, negotiation of separation) and makes recommendations for creating \\"attachment friendly\\" environments for parents (biological or adoptive) and day care providers.

It is a spiritual successor to Electronic Arts' Mutant League Football. The game was released on Microsoft Windows on October 31, 2017, released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 19, 2018, and on Nintendo Switch on October 30, 2018.  Development  The game was developed by Digital Dreams Entertainment, led by Michael Mendheim, designer of the original Mutant League game. In 2013, Mendheim ran a Kickstarter campaign to fund the game's development, asking for $750,000. The project failed to reach its goal, but Mendheim persisted with the project. In 2017, a second Kickstarter campaign raised a more modest goal of $60,000. Mendheim stated that due to the original funding failure the game will not have as much content as originally planned, and that the main purpose of the second Kickstarter was to fund development of online multiplayer.  Gameplay  Mutant Football League is a violent, over-the-top interpretation of the game of football. It draws inspiration from the original Mutant League Football, as well as other games in the genre such as NFL Blitz. The game features 7-on-7 action, with teams made up of various mutants, including Skeletal Deadheads, Monstrous Orcs, BruiserBots, Mutant-Humans, Hell-Spawned Demons, Rampaging Werewolves, and Criminal Aliens. The fields are littered with obstacles, including buzzsaws and landmines. Players can call normal plays, as well as \\"dirty tricks\\", which include bribing the referee, and using a chainsaw to cut through the opposition.  Teams  Many of the teams are parodies of real-life NFL teams, with names like the Nuked London Hatriots and the Deadlanta Vultures.

Most of these complexes are orange or red-brown solid, slightly soluble in hot water yielding an orange or orange-yellow solution at pH < 2.0. The solution becomes green at pH > 2.0. Ferric citrates play important roles in the metabolism of iron by living organisms. Citrate anions are released by plant roots and some microorganisms in order to extract iron from insoluble compounds in the soil, such as ferric hydroxide, and form soluble ferric citrates that can be absorbed by the organism. Ferric citrate is used in medicine to regulate the blood levels of iron in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. It acts by forming an insoluble compound with phosphate present in the diet and thus reducing its uptake by the digestive system.Julia B. Lewis, Mohammed Sika, Mark J. Koury, and others (2015): \\"Ferric Citrate Controls Phosphorus and Delivers Iron in Patients on Dialysis\\", Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, volume 26, issue 2, pages 493-503.

Thus it is not a single well-defined compound, but a family of compounds, all with the same basic formula and many different structures. This complexity extends to solutions, where various forms can coexist in equilibrium.Andre M. N. Silva, XiaoLe Kong, Mark C. Parkin, Richard Cammack and Robert C. Hider (2009): \\"Iron(III) citrate speciation in aqueous solution\\". Royal Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions, pages 8616-8625. At physiological pH, ferric citrate forms an insoluble red polymer. In other conditions, it forms anionic complexes like []2()2]2‚àí. In the present of excess citrate anions, the iron forms negatively charged complexes like [()2]5‚àí and [()8()3]7‚àí.Avi Bino, Itzhak Shweky, Shmuel Cohen, Erika R. Bauminger, and Stephen J. Lippard (1998), \\"A novel nonairon(III) citrate complex: A 'ferric triple-decker'\\". Inorganic Chemistry, volume 37, issue 20, pages 5168‚Äì5172. Preparation Ferric citrate can be prepared by adding a stoichiometric amount of iron(III) sulfate tetrahydrate to a solution of citric acid and sodium hydroxide at pH 3.0. The complex can be precipitated by adding ethanol to the solution. Chemical properties =Photoreduction= The ion in ferric citrate (as in many iron(III) carboxylates) is reduced by exposure to light,Wu Feng and Deng Nansheng (2000): \\"Photochemistry of hydrolytic iron (III) species and photoinduced degradation of organic compounds: A minireview\\".

This reaction is not observed at pH < 1.5 or pH > 5.0, or in aprotic water-free solvents such as acetonitrile. In water, it has maximum quantum efficiency around pH = 2.9. It can be observed even in the solid state. This reaction plays an important role in plant metabolism: iron is carried up from the roots as ferric citrate dissolved in the sap,Rub√©n Rell√°n-√Ålvarez, Justo Giner-Mart√≠nez-Sierra, Jes√∫s Orduna, and others (2010): \\"Identification of a tri-iron(III), tri-citrate complex in the xylem sap of iron-deficient tomato resupplied with iron: New insights into plant iron long- distance transport\\".

Theodor Arps was notable for managing the German Naval Intelligence Service (German:Marinenachrichtendienst) from 1 October 1934 to 31 December 1939. Arps' time at the Marinenachrichtendienst was known for increased rearmament at the agency, a modernizing period, preparing and undertaking assurance testing on the Naval Enigma for secure message use cases (which was insecure), training and mobilization planning and an increasingly efficient and modern signal intelligence architecture that was the culmination of two decades of work during the interwar period. Life Theodor Arps entered the Imperial Navy on 1 April 1902 as a sea cadet and completed his basic training. He received ship training on the training ship , and then from 1 April 1903 to 30 September 1904 at the German Imperial Naval Academy. After successful training, his transfer took place on board the pre-dreadnought battleship , where he was promoted to Lieutenant on 29 September 1905. As a company officer, he changed to the 2nd Torpedo Division on 1 October 1906 and was there as an officer on various torpedo boats. On 1 May 1909, the promotion of the Lieutenant to the Sea (since 30 March 1908) took place for a year as the first officer on the station ship . Then he was posted on 30 September 1911, again as a watch officer, to the dreadnought battleship . Subsequently, there were commandments for training purposes in the ship artillery with subsequent transfer to the ship artillery school in Kiel-Wik as an instructor. On 18 January 1913, Arps was posted as a watch officer to the light cruiser , where he was promoted to Kapit√§nleutnant on 15 July 1913. With the outbreak of the World War I, Arps became as an artillery officer on the passenger steamers SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, that had recently been converted to an auxiliary cruiser, and conducted trade warfare against the West African coast. On 26 August 1914, the British cruiser HMS Highflyer attacked the ship in front of R√≠o de Oro. Arps and a large part of the crew saved themselves by swimming to land and were interned until 13 October 1914 by the Spanish authorities. After the German marines had been handed over to the French, he was held by the French until 12 July 1918, and then again in a Swiss internment camp until 12 August 1919. After his return to Germany, he was put at the disposition and on 27 April 1920, with the rank of Korvettenkapit√§n, took leave of the navy. Arps' military career was reactivated on 1 October 1933 in his old rank and he was posted as an officer to the Naval Command (Marineleitung). On the occasion of his promotion to the Captain at sea on 1 October 1934, he was appointed chief of the Naval Intelligence Service in the Oberkommando der Marine of the Kriegsmarine. He held this position beyond the beginning of World War II and until 31 December 1939. At the beginning of the new year, he was promoted to the rank of Konteradmiral, and as such judge at the Reichskriegsgericht in Berlin. On 1 April 1942, he was promoted to Vizeadmiral. On 8 May 1945, Arps was captured by the American advance in Torgau. He died on 28 April 1947 in a camp near Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, an NSF ADVANCE award (joint with Nava Rubin), and a New Directions Fellowship from the Mellon Foundation. In 2017, she became the first woman and first African-American president of Pomona College. Starr was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2020.  Biography  Starr grew up in Tallahassee, Florida. She began college at Emory University at age 15, where she earned her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in 1993 in Women's Studies. She studied at the University of St Andrews in Scotland as a Robert T. Jones Scholar. From there, she earned a PhD in English Literature from Harvard University in 1999. After receiving her PhD, Starr decided to retrain in cognitive neuroscience, supported by a New Directions Fellowship awarded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the California Institute of Technology, exploring techniques from cognitive neuroscience. She joined the faculty at NYU in 2000 and became the acting dean of the College of Arts and Science in 2011 and non-acting dean in 2013. With Susanne Wofford and faculty at NYU, in 2015 Starr co-founded a liberal arts prison education program at Wallkill Correctional Facility in New York State. In addition, Starr, in collaboration with the Borough of Manhattan Community College, initiated a STEM preparation and transfer program, P.O.I.S.E., to provide promising students with support, mentorship and financial access to encourage them to undertake a bachelor's degree in STEM subjects at NYU.

Research  Starr's research is highly interdisciplinary, combining literary scholarship, empirical aesthetics, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. Her most recent book, Feeling Beauty, proposes a neural model of aesthetic experience that relies on a network of interconnected neural structures. Feeling Beauty was shortlisted for the Christian Gauss Award of Phi Beta Kappa in 2014.https://www.pbk.org/WEB/PBK_Member/PRESSROOM/Press_Releases/201408AnnualShortListBookAwards.aspx Her current research uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to understand the neural basis of aesthetic experiences, providing evidence that the default mode network is involved in the representation of aesthetic appeal. She has published articles in journals including Modern Philology, Eighteenth-Century Fiction, Eighteenth-Century Studies, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Cognition, NeuroImage, and Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts.

Biography Ahmadi was born in Tehran, Iran in 1975. Her upbringing, which is reflected in her art, was marked by the Iranian Revolution and the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. She obtained a bachelor of fine art from Azad University in 1998 and right after moved to USA to pursue her graduate studies. She attended Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan and received an Master of Art Degree in Drawing (2000) and a Master of Fine Arts in Drawing (2003). In 2003 she attended an artist residency at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 2005 Ahmadi obtained her second MFA, in painting from Cranbrook Academy of Art. Ahmadi was appointed as an Associate Professor of Art at the University of California, Davis in 2015. Career Ahmadi's practice borrows from the artistic traditions of Iran and the Middle East to critically examine contemporary political tensions. Incorporating cultural symbols Ahmadi has taken a critical look at current social and political issues. Ahmadi works across a variety of media, including watercolor painting, sculpture, and video animation; consistent through her pieces are the ornate patterns and vibrant colors drawn from Persian, Indian and Middle Eastern art. In her carefully illustrated worlds, formal beauty complicates global legacies of violence and oppression. These playful fantasy realms are upon closer inspection macabre theaters of politics and war: watercolor paint bloodies the canvas, and sinister global machinations play out in abstracted landscapes populated by faceless figures and dominated by oil refineries and labyrinthine pipelines. Known for her achievements in painting, her later career has been marked by the use of video-animation. Her first animation Lotus was exhibited extensively in US and around the world and gained recognition from many critics and curators. Her latest animation titled Ascend (2017) was inspired by the death of Aylan Kurdi and Syrian refugee crisis in 2015. It was acquired by the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. Ahmadi's work is included in the collections of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Asia Society Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the DePaul Art Museum, the Morgan Library & Museum, the Herbert F. Johnson Museum, the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, the TDIC Corporate Collection in the United Arab Emirates, and the Farjam Collection in Dubai. Her piece Pipes, a five-feet wide watercolor, was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2014. In 2016 she was awarded the Anonymous Was A Woman award. In 2018 Ahmadi was awarded a fellowship at the Civitella Ranieri Art Residency in Umbria, Italy.

She was also the author of children's books, her works include, \\"The Legend of the Fog\\" and \\"Grandmother Ptarmigan\\".  Family Life  Qaunaq is the daughter of Mary Kudjuakjuk, a graphic artist. Qaunaq grew up traditionally on Inuit lands and began to make small carvings after her father‚Äôs death when she was still a girl. She was married to Inuit artist, Ohotaq (Oqutaq) Mikkigak. She resides in Cape Dorset, Nunavut.  Art Work  Sculpting is her preferred artistic medium, Qaunak stated, \\"It feels very good when you're comfortable in feeling good about your carvings especially when other people like your carvings. Then you know you can do a carving each and every time you begin one.\\" Her work evolves as she builds as she does not depend on preconceived ideas. She began her sculpting practice with simple subjects and spare forms. These evolved in volume and complexity as she developed her artistic style. At times she will combine multiple subjects to create totemic or superimposed forms. In 1976, she entered a jewelry-making competition that was sponsored by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs titled, \\"The Things that Make Us Beautiful.\\" She used her skills of sewing, engraving and sculpting to create a series of colorful pieces. Her work has been shown at that the National Gallery of Canada.

Her carvings served as her commentary on both traditional and changing contemporary Inuit culture. She was one of the first Inuit artists to work in an autobiographical sense. Tunnillie came from a noted artistic family. Her parents, Sheojuke Toonoo (1928‚Äì2012) and Toonoo (1920‚Äì1969) were noted artists and her grandmother, Mary Qayuaryuk (1908‚Äì1982), (also known as Kudjuakjuk) was also a sculptor. Inspired to try carving soapstone at an early age by her father, Toonoo, her instruction was interrupted when she contracted tuberculosis and was sent to hospitals in Brandon, Manitoba, and Clearwater Lake, Manitoba.  Career  Tunnillie carved her first work, Mother and Child, in 1966 when she was 17 years old. Tunnillie's works are rendered in the distinctive serpentinite rock that is common to South Baffin. Her style is distinctive, employing an architectural quality. Themes in her work range from alcohol abuse and rape to memories of her time in a southern TB clinic freely depicting the inter-cultural reality of the contemporary Inuk woman. Her work is featured in several private and public collections including the Canadian Guild of Crafts Quebec, the Canadian Museum of Civilization, the National Gallery of Canada, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, and the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. Her work is also featured in Keeping our Stories Alive: The Sculpture of Canada's Inuit along with the work of Lucy Meeko and Uriash Puqiqnak. She was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy in 2003.

Early life  Burghardt was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, the daughter of John Budd Burghardt and Asenath Lucinda Grant. Her mother died when Caroline was a girl. She was working as a governess in New York at the outbreak of the Civil War. Poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant was an acquaintance of Burghardt's, and may have helped place her in a nursing role during the war.  War service  On April 19, 1861, Burghardt reported to Bellevue Hospital where she was accepted for nurse training by the board of surgeons. Her training lasted until June 8, 1861, when she traveled to Washington to begin acting as a nurse in the war. Burghardt served as a nurse until September 6, 1865. She was stationed at numerous locations, such as Antietam, Gettysburg, Fortress Monroe, Winchester, and Alexandria. After Burghardt's service ended, Dorothea Dix composed a \\"testimony of hospital services\\" regarding Burghardt's work during the war. In this letter, Dix commented on Burghardt's \\"superior fidelity and skill.\\"  Career after the war  Burghardt continued her medical career well after the Civil War ended. In 1872, when she was 42 years old, Burghardt graduated from the medical school at Howard University. Afterwards, she practiced homeopathic medicine and began her own medical practice in Washington, D.C. She also held positions in the Treasury Department, the Commerce Department, and the Bureau of Navigation.

Early life  Forced to leave their home in Chorzow when the Germans invaded Poland, Leipciger and his family were moved to the Sosnowiec Ghetto. By 15 he had been transferred to Auschwitz-Birkenau. His mother and sister died in Auschwitz, but his father kept close to his son. Leipciger ended up as forced labour in various other camps in Silesia. Twice he recalls his father saving his life. Once, Leipciger found himself in the queue for the gas chamber, only for his father to pull him out and bring him into the camp with him. On a second occasion, the Nazis were about to send his father to a factory in Germany, but he convinced one of the officers that his son was a useful electrician, so they let Leipciger accompany his father. According to Leipciger, his father begged a Nazi officer to get Leipciger to a factory in Germany to save him from death at Auschwitz. They were incarcerated in the concentration camps of F√ºnfteichen, Gross-Rosen and Flossenb√ºrg before ending up at Waldlager V, part of the M√ºhldorf camp complex and a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp where they were eventually liberated by American soldiers. In June 1948, after living in Bamberg, Germany, for three years, Leipciger and his father immigrated to Canada.

She earned her BFA in Communication Arts and Painting from Southwest State University (now Texas State University) in 1982. In 1988 she received her MFA in Painting and Ceramics from Texas Woman's University in Denton. Professional career From January 1990 to May 2000, Mar√≠a Teresa Garc√≠a Pedroche served as the Associate Curator and Education Director at the Meadows Museum in Dallas. Since then, she has served as Head of Family Experiences and Community Engagement at the Dallas Museum of Art. Selected exhibitions and other works Mar√≠a Teresa Garc√≠a Pedroche has had exhibitions throughout Texas, as well as in countries such as Mexico and Spain. One of her most well-known exhibits, Todo sobre mi madre (all about my mother) opened at the Bath House Cultural Center in Dallas 2010. This exhibit featured a collection of her multimedia collage prints that explored the relationship between herself and her mother, in addition to other family members. She was also featured in the Tejano Art Exhibition \\"Cultura y Vida\\" at the Art Center of Corpus Christi in 2012. Central themes of artwork Mar√≠a Teresa Garc√≠a Pedroche utilizes many mediums such as multimedia prints and painting to explore the intricacies of her familial relationships. In doing so she evokes a sense of nostalgia through the assemblage of antique collaged items. Furthermore, the superimposition of religious and spiritual iconography on family pictures provides the viewer with an insight into her family's religious beliefs. Her oil paintings explore themes of womanhood through the various representation forms of the female figure. While her multimedia media works demonstrate her finesse in techniques like double exposure, the angularity and shading in works such as L√°grimas tiene el camino demonstrate her mastery of painting as well.

Gelfand is an American statistician, and is currently the James B. Duke Professor of Statistics and Decision Sciences at Duke University. Gelfand‚Äôs research includes substantial contributions to the fields of Bayesian statistics, spatial statistics and hierarchical modeling.  Early life and education  Alan E. Gelfand was born April 17, 1945 in Bronx, NY. After graduating from the public school system at the young age of 16, Gelfand attended the City College of New York (now the City University of New York; CUNY) as an undergraduate where he excelled in mathematics. Gelfand‚Äôs matriculation to graduate school symbolized both a physical and educational transition as he moved cross-country to attend Stanford University and pursue a Ph.D. in Statistics. He finished his dissertation in 1969 on seriation methods (chronological sequencing) under the direction of Herbert Soloman.  Career  Gelfand accepted an offer from the University of Connecticut where he spent 33 years as a professor. In 2002, he moved to Duke University as the James B. Duke Professor of Statistics and Decision Sciences.  Gelfand and Smith (1990)  After attending a short course taught by Adrian Smith at Bowling Green State University, Gelfand decided to take a sabbatical to Nottingham, UK with the intention of working on using numerical methods to solve empirical Bayes problems. After studying Tanner and Wong (1987) and being hinted as to its connection to Geman and Geman (1984) by David Clayton, Gelfand was able to realize the computational value of replacing expensive numerical techniques with Monte Carlo sampling-based methods in Bayesian inference. Published as Gelfand and Smith (1990), Gelfand described how the Gibbs sampler can be used for Bayesian inference in a computationally efficient manner. Since its publication, the general methods described in Gelfand and Smith (1990) has revolutionized data analysis allowing previously intractable problems to now be tractable. To date, the paper has been cited over 7500 times.  Contributions to spatial statistics  In 1994, Gelfand was presented with a dataset that he had previously not encountered: scallop catches on the Atlantic Ocean. Intrigued by the challenges associated with analyzing data with structured spatial correlation, Gelfand, along with colleagues Sudipto Banerjee and Brad Carlin, created an inferential paradigm for analyzing spatial data. Gelfand‚Äôs contributions to spatial statistics include spatially-varying coefficient models, linear models of coregionalization for multivariate spatial processes, predictive processes for analysis of large spatial data and non-parametric approaches to the analysis of spatial data. Gelfand's research in spatial statistics spans application areas of ecology, disease and the environment.

Maureen O'Connor, who had previously come in second to Hedgecock in the 1983 mayoral election, declined to run. Dick Carlson, a former anchorman and savings-and-loans executive, was considered Hedgecock's main challenger. A major issue during the campaign were allegations that Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral campaign benefited from $357,000 in illegal contributions. Carlson, on the other hand, was criticized for being inexperienced in government and for going back on a promises not to use his personal fortune in the campaign. On June 5, 1984, Hedgecock came in first in the primary with 47.0 percent of the vote, followed by Carlson with 37.7 percent of the vote. The remaining 15.3 percent of the primary vote was scattered among seven minor candidates, none of whom received more than 5 percent individually. Local newspapers interpreted the relatively high vote for the minor candidates as protest votes and an indication that the electorate was dissatisfied with both Hedgecock and Carlson. Because Hedgecock was short of an overall majority of the vote, he and Carlson advanced to a runoff election scheduled for November 6, 1984. Hedgecock ultimately prevailed in the general election with 57.9 percent of the vote, and was reelected as mayor.

She has been making her signature style of furniture with carved and embellished animal and plant motifs since 1977.  Early life and education  Judy Kensley McKie bench at Eastport Park, Boston As a young person, McKie worked with her graphic designer father in his woodshop, helping to manufacturing pieces. She cites this work as early inspiration to make furniture. She received her BFA in Painting from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1966. As a painter, she was drawn to figurative art from ancient cultures, an influence that shows up later in her furniture. Her entrance to furniture making came from the necessity to furnish her own home and to create pieces of furniture for her friends.  Career  In the late 60s, she joined a cooperative workspace called \\"New Hamburger Cabinet Works\\". While working in this space, McKie honed her craft skills through trial-and-error and by working around other furniture makers such as Michael Hurwitz. After several years of working on cabinetry and other projects built collaboratively with the other members of the cooperative, McKie ventured into her own style which included curves, personal ideals, and inspiration from plants and animals. McKie began to carve low-relief patterns of animals and nature into her furniture work in 1975. This started on flat surfaces such as boxes and evolved to the structural elements of the work such as a table in which two dogs with long tails and bones in their mouths sit underneath a glass table top and a rocking chair with a pair of rattle snakes as the rockers. This unique style of work earned Mckie sales and commissions as well as significant recognition in the field of studio furniture. McKie's work was included alongside her contemporaries Wendell Castle and Joyce Anderson in the 1979 exhibition \\"New Handmade Furniture: American Furniture Makers Working in Hardwood\\" held at the American Craft Museum in New York City. in 2004, McKie held a solo exhibition at Pritam & Eames Gallery. In the Spring of 2018, McKie had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Craft and Design in San Francisco \\"Judy Kensley McKie: Cast of Characters\\", curated by Glenn Adamson and Ariel Zaccheo.

He travels throughout Canada giving talks about his experiences as a concentration camp survivor, to students, teachers, universities, law enforcement personnel, and the community at large. He has worked with the March of the Living, the Sarah and Chaim Neuberger Holocaust Education Centre, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, and the Canadian Centre for Diversity and Inclusion (CCDI). With the encouragement of German lawyer Thomas Walther, Eisen testified in Germany at the trial of two former SS guards at Auschwitz: Reinhold Hanning (in 2016) and Oskar Gr√∂ning (2015). Both were convicted at their trials. He has been an active participant in March of the Living having made the journey back to Auschwitz-Birkenau, with thousands of students, 18 times.  Early life  Eisen was born into an Orthodox Jewish family with two brothers and a baby sister. Along with his immediate family, Eisen lived with his uncle, aunt and paternal grandparents and was surrounded by a large extended family of some 60 members. Eisen would live through a 13-day death march from Auschwitz to Loslau and there he was loaded onto metal boxcars made for transporting coal and sent to Mauthausen. Then from Melk he participated in a three-day march in the mountains to Ebensee. He was liberated on May 6, 1945. From Max's large extended family, only two cousins returned. Max arrived in Quebec City on October 25, 1949, and was sent to Toronto by the Canadian Jewish community. He married Ivy Cosman, with whom he has two children, two grandchildren and three great- grandchildren.  Rescue  Eisen attributes his survival, in part, to the heroism of a member of the Polish resistance and to a US Army liberator. Dr. Tadeusz Orzeszko, the chief surgeon in the surgery department in Auschwitz, took pity on the 15 year old Eisen. He operated on him after a brutal beating by a Nazi guard and engaged him to be his assistant. Many years later, Eisen learned that Orzeszko was a member of the Polish resistance in Auschwitz. Sgt. Johnnie Steven, of the African American 761st Tank Battalion (United States) known as the Black Panthers, liberated Eisen on May 6, 1945.http://marchoftheliving.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Max-Eisen- CJN-2011-A-Story-of-Courage-and-Gratitude2.pdf Portions of Max Eisen‚Äôs story appear in the film ‚ÄúCome Out Fighting: The 761st‚Äù (2002) directed by Fern Levitt and in Witness: Passing the Torch of Holocaust Memory to New Generations‚Äô by author Eli Rubenstein who also wrote the Afterword for his memoir, \\"By Chance Alone\\".

Her enjoyment of writing stories and poems as a child prompted her to publish many poems, manuscripts, and chapbooks throughout her life. After receiving her B.A. and Masters of Education from University of Texas at Austin, she went on to win first place at the 2013 Austin International Poetry Festival Contest and the Austin Poetry Society Award. She is now a workshop presenter for youth and adults, and is an active alumna of Hedgebrook's Writers-in-Residence program. Amescua is most known for her poetry chapbook entitled \\"Windchimes\\" and \\"What Remains.\\" She recently won an award for her picture book manuscript in verse: Luz Jim√©nez, No Ordinary Girl. She now resides in Austin and continues to earn awards for her culturally vibrant poetry and prominence in the Texas Latinx community.  Early life  Amescua was born in Austin, Texas. Her father was born in Michoac√°n, Mexico. Her mother was Mexican American. Her dual identity as a Latina and Tejana helped to mold the major themes present throughout Amescua's poetry and manuscripts. She writes beautifully what she knows: poems about her family and beyond. She also wrote a picture book manuscript through the lens of her character Luz Jim√©nez, a Nahua educator and art muse living in Mexico, which won the 2016 New Visions Honor Award. She continues to write poetry and picture books.  Career  Amescua went on to earn a bachelor's degree and Masters of Education from UT at Austin, and worked for some years in education as an English teacher. She also became a high school assistant principal and the Secondary Language Arts Curriculum Director for a large school district in Texas. She has since been published in a variety of books as well as print and online journals. Her excellence in writing has earned many prestigious awards, including the Austin Poetry Society Award and the Christina Sergeyevna Award for poetry. She most recently was chosen among hundreds of writers to receive the Lee and Low 2016 New Voices Award Honor for her poetry manuscript, Luz Jim√©nez, No Ordinary Girl. She is an inaugural member of CantoMundo, a national Latinx poetry community. She has often attributed her work with this group as a cause of her continued growth as a poet and a Latina. Additionally, she has made significant contributions to the Society of Children‚Äôs Book Writers and Illustrators‚Äô Austin Chapter, of which she is a salient member.

Her most recent manuscript, Luz Jim√©nez, No Ordinary Girl, features a Nahua woman who overcomes various cultural obstacles through her experience as a teacher and art muse in Mexico. Luz, meaning \\"light\\" in Spanish, eventually serves, through her teaching, as a link between the Aztecs and her Nahua culture. Although not autobiographical, one can draw many links to Amescua and Luz's similar spirits. Happily, Amescua's themes are, more often than not, positive messages about the life of a Tejana and one's ability to achieve dreams with hard work and compassion. She dedicates many of her poems to her mother, a woman whom she clearly admires and adores. In her poem, \\"Fall into the Fig,\\" featured in the book Entre Guadalupe y Malinche: Tejanas in Literature and Art, she characterizes her mother as: ‚ÄúMore than an uneducated ‚ÄòMexican‚Äô. . . / More than a laundress and a cook in the schools / More than our father‚Äôs wife and our mother / always a fire of possibility‚Äù (69). This passage exemplifies Amescua‚Äôs faith in her mother and her belief of the possibility of a different life for her.

It was created through the Katiti Land Claim in 1980. The trust's owners include Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Luritja people. The block of land is officially referred to as Northern Territory Portion 1818. It borders the larger Petermann Land Trust area and Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park to the north and west, and two pastoral stations to the east and south: Curtin Springs and Mulga Park. The town of Yulara is excluded from the Land Trusts, and sits between the Katiti block and Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park. The trust is named after Katiti (Bobbie's Well), a natural spring located about south of Lake Amadeus. This spring was first written about by Baldwin Spencer and Francis James Gillen. They visited it in 1894 on their way to Ulu·πüu, and recorded the name \\"Kurtitina\\" (more accurately, '). The prospecting expedition led by Lawrence Wells visited the spring in 1903, and Herbert Basedow marked it on his maps as \\"Curtyteena\\". History Before the 1970s, the area of land now held by the Katiti ALT was considered crown land by the government. The region to the southwest had been declared an Aboriginal reservation in 1920. An area of land around Ulu·πüu and Kata Tju·πØa had been made into the Ayers Rock‚ÄìMt Olga National Park in 1958. The Katiti block, however, was considered unused. In 1976, the Australian Federal Government passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. This law allowed Aboriginal communities to claim ownership of unused land, and to be granted freehold title to that land if they could show that they had a historical association with it. Section 4 of the act gave the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs the power to establish Land Trusts to look after the title. The Katiti Land Claim was formally submitted in 1979. The claim was for a larger area than what is held by the Trust today, and included the Ayers Rock‚ÄìMt Olga National Park. It was submitted by the Central Land Council on the behalf of several hundred people, most of whom lived at Mu·πØitjulu. The people were granted legal ownership to the block of land now held by the Katiti ALT on 30 September 1980. They were not granted the title to Ayers Rock‚ÄìMt Olga because it was already being used as a national park. They were, however, recognised as the park's traditional owners ('). Also excluded from the property granted were a area surrounding the resort town of Yulara, and a area covering the Petermann Road, which provided tourist access to Ulu·πüu. Petermann Road was later replaced by the Lasseter Highway, and the government transferred the title to the old road to the Katiti ALT on 23 February 1990. Legal ownership over the national park's land was eventually granted to its traditional owners in 1985, and the title to this area is held by the Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa Aboriginal Land Trust.

While psychedelic, entheogenic or hallucinogenic substances have been used by many traditional cultures throughout history mostly for religious purposes, recorded philosophical speculation and analysis of these substances, their phenomenological effects and the relevance of these altered states of consciousness to philosophical questions is a relatively late phenomenon in the history of philosophy. Traditional cultures who use psychedelic substances such as the Amazonian and Indigenous Mexican peoples hold that ingesting medicinal plants such as Ayahuasca and Peyote allows one to commune with the beings of the spirit world. Indian philosophy The Indian Yogi and scholar Patanjali in his Yoga sutras mentions that mystic powers (siddhaya) can arise from certain \\"herbs\\" or \\"healing plants\\"Arthur Anthony Macdonell, Arthur Berriedale; Vedic Index of Names and Subjects, Volume 1; Volume 5 (osadhi): :janmau·π£adhi-mantra-tapa·∏• samƒÅdhi jƒÅ·∏• siddhaya·∏• :The mystic powers arise due to birth, herbs, mantras, the performance of austerity and samadhi.

New York: Raven Press, 1973. see: Baudelaire on Drugs : Marijuana Consumption in the Age of Colonialism http://evitanza.bol.ucla.edu/baudelaire.html#_ftn15 The French Poet Baudelaire wrote about the effects of Hashish and Opium in Les Paradis artificiels (1860) and theorized about how they could be used to allow the individual to reach \\"ideal\\" states of mind. Charles Baudelaire was member of the 'Club des Hashischins', a Parisian literary group dedicated to the exploration of altered states of consciousness which included Jacques-Joseph Moreau and literary figures such as Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Gerard de Nerval, Honore de Balzac, and Theophile Gautier.Levinthal, C. F. (2012). Drugs, behavior, and modern society. (6th ed.). Boston: Pearson College Div. Baudelaire's opinion of the drug was generally negative, believing that it weakened and dampened artistic capacities, the personal Will and even the very identity of the hashish eater. He compared it to suicide and a false happiness, and saw wine as the true intoxicant of the artists.Vitanza, Baudelaire on Drugs : Marijuana Consumption in the Age of Colonialism In the United States, The Hasheesh Eater (1857) an autobiographical book by Fitz Hugh Ludlow became popular. Ludlow wrote that a Marijuana user sought \\"the soul‚Äôs capacity for a broader being, deeper insight, grander views of Beauty, Truth and Good than she now gains through the chinks of her cell.\\"Ludlow, Fitz Hugh \\"The Visionary\\", The Hasheesh Eater 1857 The American William James was one of the first academic philosophers to write about the effects of hallucinogenic substances in his The Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide (1882) in which he writes that the gas can produce a \\"tremendously exciting sense of an intense metaphysical illumination. Truth lies open to the view in depth beneath depth of almost blinding evidence. The mind sees all logical relations of being with an apparent subtlety and instantaniety to which its normal consciousness offers no parallel\\".James; The Subjective Effects of Nitrous Oxide (1882), https://erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_article1.shtml He goes on to say that the experience gave him the sense that the philosophy of Hegel was true. In his The Varieties of Religious Experience he likewise writes: > Nitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide ‚Ä¶ stimulate the mystical > consciousness in an extraordinary degree. ‚Ä¶ [In] the nitrous oxide trance we > have a genuine metaphysical revelation. ‚Ä¶ [Our] normal waking consciousness, > rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of > consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of > screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely > different.James, William; The Varieties of Religious Experience, ch. XVI 20th century After using mescaline in 1953, Aldous Huxley wrote The Doors of Perception where he advanced the theory that psychedelic compounds could produce mystical experiences and knowledge, \\"what the visionary, the medium, even the mystic were talking about\\" and what eastern philosophy described with terms like Satcitananda, the Godhead, Suchness, Void, Not-self and Dharmakaya.Huxley, The Doors of Perception Huxley also quotes the philosopher C. D. Broad, which held that the brain and nervous might act as a reducing valve of all the stimuli in the universe: > According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially Mind at Large. But > in so far as we are animals, our business is at all costs to survive. To > make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through > the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the > other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help > us to stay alive on the surface of this Particular planet. Huxley wrote that it was possible that certain human beings could, through drugs, meditation, etc. circumvent the 'reducing valve' and experience something far beyond everyday consciousness. This experience Huxley saw as the source of all mysticism, a theory termed the Perennial philosophy. He also discusses art and the legality of various drugs in the West as well as arguing for the importance for self-transcendence. Huxley's philosophical novel Island also described a Utopian society that used a psychedelic substance for spiritual purposes. In the early 1960s a group that eventually came to be called \\"Harvard Psychedelic Club\\" which included Timothy Leary, Huston Smith and Ram Dass administered psychedelics to Harvard students. The group experimented with psychedelics in experiments such as the Harvard Psilocybin Project. Huston Smith's last work, Cleansing the Doors of Perception, describes the Harvard Project in which he participated. Ram Dass' Be here now and Tim Leary's The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead compared the psychedelic experiences to eastern philosophy and mystical states of consciousness. These books further popularized the idea that eastern - particularly Indian philosophical and spiritual insights could be obtained from using psychedelics. One of these experiences described in The Psychedelic Experience is that of ego death or depersonalization. The idea that the psychedelic experience could grant access to eastern spiritual insights was also promoted by the popular philosopher Alan Watts in his writings such as The Joyous Cosmology, who also argued that one should not remain dependent on them for spiritual growth: \\"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\\"The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book). Various psychologists during the 1960s also studied psychedelic substances and worked with Psychedelic therapy and later developed various theories about their effects and significance. Stanislav Grof is known for his extensive work in LSD psychotherapy and for developing a theory which stated that the psychedelic experience allowed one to relive birth trauma and to explore the depths of the unconscious mind. Grof observed four levels of the LSD experience, which for him correspond to areas of the human unconscious: (1) Abstract and aesthetic experiences (2) Psychodynamic experiences (3) Perinatal experiences, and (4) Transpersonal experiences. Grof defined the last level as \\"experiences involving an expansion or extension of consciousness beyond the usual ego boundaries and beyond the limitations of time and/or space.\\"PSYPRESSUK CONTRIBUTORS; Realms of the Human Unconscious by Stanislav Grof PUBLISHED JANUARY 19, 2011 ¬∑ UPDATED FEBRUARY 5, 2015, http://psypressuk.com/2011/01/19/literary-review-realms-of-the-human- unconscious-by-stanislav-grof/ The field of Transpersonal psychology focuses on this type of experience. Grof included topics such as consciousness, mysticism and metaphysics in his later writings. The scientist and philosopher John C. Lilly discussed his experiments with psychedelics and altered states of consciousness in The Center of the Cyclone: An Autobiography of Inner Space and Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer. Other psychologists who studied and wrote on psychedelic use include Walter Pahnke, Ralph Metzner and Claudio Naranjo. According to writer James Oroc, the 1990s brought about a second phase in modern psychedelic culture. The 'philosophical foundation' of this new wave of psychedelic thought was based on the works of Alexander Shulgin, Alex Grey and Terence McKenna.Oroc, James; The Second Psychedelic Revolution, http://realitysandwich.com/216613/the-second- psychedelic-revolution-part-one-the-end-of-acid/ Contemporary Neuroscientist Rick Strassman has written about his research into the psychedelic N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in his book DMT: The Spirit Molecule (2001). In his book Strassman investigates the possible connection between natural DMT in mystical and Near Death Experiences and psychedelic states caused by outwardly administered DMT. He also describes the psychedelic experiences of the volunteers in his experiments and their encounter with certain strange \\"beings\\" after being administered DMT. In his study of recent scientific research on psychedelics and its neurophilosophy (Neuropsychedelia, 2012), Nicolas Langlitz has argued that Huxley's view expressed in the Doors of perception of the brain as a \\"reducing valve\\" which when released produced a perennial mystical experience has been a very influential theory among contemporary psychopharmacologists who study psychedelics, who have given it a materialist 'neurobiological reinterpretation' which he calls ‚Äúmystic materialism‚Äù.Langlitz; Nicolas; IS THERE A PLACE FOR PSYCHEDELICS IN PHILOSOPHY? Fieldwork in Neuro- and Perennial Philosophy, http://www.nicolaslanglitz.de/nicolaslanglitz.de/Texts_files/Langlitz%202016%20-%20IS%20THERE%20A%20PLACE%20FOR%20PSYCHEDELICS%20IN%20PHILOSOPHY%3F.pdf Langlitz defines this as: \\"a this-worldly mysticism that reveres not transcendence but biological life\\" and holds to a certain \\"metaphysical unity of the world\\". Thomas Metzinger has discussed the effects of substances such as LSD, dimethyltryptamine, and mescaline in his Being No One (2003). Metzinger describes the hallucinatory component of the psychedelic experience as \\"epistemically vacuous\\" i.e. it provides no epistemic knowledge. In spite of this, Metzinger still believes that philosophers and consciousness researchers would have much to gain if they were \\"well traveled in phenomenal state space, if they were cultivated in terms of the richness of their own inner experience\\" through the psychedelic experience. According to Metzinger, psychedelic experiences could change researchers' theoretical intuitions as well as serving as a form of 'mental culture', an analogue to Physical culture. The American author Sam Harris has discussed his use of psychedelics in his book Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion which also attempts to argue for a naturalized spirituality. The contemporary philosopher write about psychedelics is Peter Sj√∂stedt-H. His recent Noumenautics (2015) discusses psychedelic phenomenology and its metaphysical implications. In his encyclopedic overview of psychedelic culture and thought Psychedelia (2012), Patrick Lundborg developed a psychedelic philosophy he called \\"Unified Psychedelic Theory\\" (UPT) which draws from Platonism, the phenomenology of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, Paul D. MacLean's Triune brain theory, the work of Eugen Fink and other thinkers.

The International Women's Strike, also known as Paro Internacional de Mujeres, is a global movement coordinated across over 50 countries and coinciding with International Women's Day, on 8 March 2017 and 2018. The United Nations announced the theme of \\"Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030\\", calling for gender equality around the globe. In the United States, the strike was branded as \\"Day Without a Woman\\".  Background  On 3 October 2016 women in Poland organized a nationwide strike following a Polish parliamentary decision to consider a ban on abortion that would criminalize all terminations. The day became known as Black Monday. 19 October 2016 saw the #NiUnaMenos protest against femicide in Argentina, a large-scale response to the murder of 16-year-old Luc√≠a P√©rez. Similar demonstrations took place in other Latin American countries including Mexico, El Salvador, Chile, and others. A week later, on 25 October 2017, Brazil held its own #NiUnaMenos strike. Due to countries like Poland and Argentina coming together, the International Women's Strike was formed in 2017. It was coordinated by Polish women and allowed for groups to state their demands. During regular Skype meetings, lasting as long as 4 hours, women from more than 30 countries shared information on what they were doing for the strike. This led to large strikes in some countries, with rallies and downing tools, while others were smaller.  Participating countries  Over 50 countries participated in the International Women's Strike. = Ireland = In Ireland, the platform titled \\"Strike 4 Repeal\\" demanded: \\"[...] that the Irish government call a referendum to repeal the 8th amendment by the 8th of March. If not, we will strike.\\" The strike action was inspired by the Black Protest in Poland months earlier. =United States= In the United States, A Day Without a Woman was a general strike held on 8 March 2017 and organized by two different groups‚Äîthe 2017 Women's March and a separate International Women's Strike movement. The two groups asked that women not work that day to protest the policies of the administration of Donald Trump, encouraging women to refrain from working, spending money (or, alternatively, electing to shop only at \\"small, women- and minority-owned businesses\\"), and to wear red as a sign of solidarity. = Spain = On 8 March 2018, the Spanish feminist movement called for a 24-hour strike. The slogan of the day was \\"If we stop, the world stops.\\" Instead of the strike being a simple labor strike, women were encourage to strike in other aspects of their lives. Women \\"were summoned to stop working, to stop attending classes, to cease to undertake care work and to avoid consuming.\\" Almost 6 million workers participated in the strike and joined marches in cities across the country. After the International Women's Strike was organized in 2017 and carried out, the next day, several feminist organizations started working together to make the 24 hour strike on 8 March 2018 have a bigger impact. The 8 March Commission was the commission that organized the 8 March demonstration in Madrid in previous years. This commission began meeting on the 8th of every month to organize a general strike in Spain which needed cooperation from many feminist groups in the country. This led to the creation of a national 8 March commission. Local 8 March committees were created everywhere in the country as well, including cities and towns. They have monthly meetings where anyone can attend. Some meetings in Madrid have drawn as many as 200 women. In 2018, the strike call that the national commission wanted was going to tackle \\"gender violence, bodies and the right to choose, borders and the economy.\\" The commission was fairly diverse, with women having been in the precious cycle of protests in the 70s. Hundreds of organizations as well as local political groups supported the strike. Due to the success of the strike call, the issues that were raised gained major importance with media outlets and the press.'

She made some five voyages before she burnt off the coast of Africa in 1796. During her first voyage her master fired on another British slave ship, which gave rise to an interesting court case. As a letter of marque she recaptured a British ship in 1794. Career Othello entered Lloyd's Register in 1787 with McGauley, master, Parke & Co. owner, and trade Liverpool-Africa.Lloyd's Register (1787), Seq. ‚ÑñO50. Captain James McGauley sailed Othello from Liverpool on 20 December 1786, bound for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands.Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database Voyages Othello (1788-1795). At the coast of Cameroon he delivered trade goods to the natives, but payment, in the form of slaves, was slow in coming. When the slave ship , Thomas Smith, master, arrived at Calabar, Captain Patrick Fairweather, of , another vessel under the ownership of the Tarleton-Backhouse partnership, and a senior captain for them, sent Banastre to the coast of Cameroon. When she arrived there some natives in a canoe approached to trade with her, but were warned off by a shot from Othello that killed one of the natives. McGauley had ordered the shot fired because the natives on that coast owed him a debt and he had declared that he would permit no trade until they had paid him. In 1793 the case of Tarleton and others vs. McGauley came to trial with the plaintiffs suing McGauley for loss of trade. The court found for the plaintiffs, establishing that it is a tort \\"to cause damage to a person by maliciously using any unlawful means, (e.g. fraud, or threats of assault), to induce anyone to abstain from entering into a contract with him.\\" McGauley eventually gathered slaves, and then delivered them to Dominica. He arrived on 2 December 1788 with 150 slaves, having embarked 185, for a mortality rate of 19%. She left Dominica on 1 February 1789, and arrived back at Liverpool on 16 March. Othello had a crew of 36 when she started out on the voyage and she lost 21 crew members during the voyage. In 1790 Othello underwent lengthening and repairs.Lloyd's List (1793), Seq. ‚ÑñO55. Her burthen increased from 122 to 208 tons. Captain John Powell sailed Othello on 16 March 1790 for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands. He gathered his slaves at Cameroon, which he left on 20 October, and delivered his slaves to Grenada on 26 November. Othello had embarked 302 slaves and landed 277, for a loss rate of 8.3%. She left Grenada on 30 December and arrived back at Liverpool on 18 February 1791. She had also sailed with a crew of 26, and lost eight crew members on the voyage. On 8 April 1791 Powell again sailed Othello to the same region. This time he gathered his slaves at Calabar. Othello left Africa on 6 November and delivered her slaves to Jamaica in December. She had embarked 273 slaves for a loss rate of 8.4%. She had also started with a crew of 24, two of whom died on the journey. During the voyage Captain William Hewitt replaced Powell. Othello arrived back at Liverpool on 16 March 1792. Captain William Hewitt may have been the intended captain in 1793 for another voyage for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands. However, Captain Thomas Jolly replaced Powell. The French Revolutionary Wars had just begun when Jolly received a letter of marque on 28 February. Jolly sailed on 5 May 1792 and arrived at Calabar on 1 July. Othello left Africa on 17 March 1793, and arrived at Montego Bay on 20 May. She had embarked 316 slaves and landed 283, for a loss rate of 10.4%. She left Jamaica on 26 July and arrived back at Liverpool 25 September. She had started with a crew of 24 men and lost 9 on the voyage. Captain David Christian received a letter of marque on 21 December 1793. He sailed Othello for West Central Africa and St. Helena on 14 January 1794. On her way to deliver her slaves to Jamaica, on 4 November 1794 she recaptured Minerva. Minerva, Hayes, master, had been sailing from Cork to Saint Domingo when she was captured on 20 October. Othello sent Minerva into Antigua.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2672. Christian's letter of marque made the action legal. Othello again delivered her slaves to Jamaica, where she arrived in July. She had embarked 342 slaves and had not lost any. Othello left Kingston on 13 October and arrived at Liverpool on 13 December. She had sailed with 31 crew and had eight men die.

He also was known for a stint as penciler of the superhero team the Justice Society of America for what later became DC Comics. Peddy began his art career during the late-1930s and 1940s period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books and remained active in the medium into the 1970s, when he began concentrating on commercial art and advertising. Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein's 1965 painting Sound of Music is based on a Peddy comic-book panel. Early life and career Arthur Peddy was born in New Jersey. He entered the fledgling comic book field in 1938 at Eisner & Iger, one of a handful of \\"packagers\\" that would produce outsourced comics on demand for publishers experimenting with the new medium, and continued there after Eisner departed in 1940 and it became the S. M. Iger Studio. Peddy's first known comic-book work was the four-page Western feature \\"Waco Kid\\" in publisher Fox Comics' Mystery Men Comics #1 (cover-dated Aug. 1939). For that publisher as well as for Fiction House and Quality Comics, he drew seafaring stories, jungle adventures, science-fiction stories and other genre tales. With writer Toni Blum. he shared the pen name Lance Blackwood on at least one story starring Merlin the Magician, a descendant of Arthurian Merlin, in Quality's National Comics #8 (Feb. 1941).

In the series, Mebius was introduced as a rookie member of the Land of Light's , who was sent to Earth for the first time after the previous Ultra, Ultraman 80, left Earth. Upon his arrival, Mebius fought against a series of monster attacks on Earth while at the same time joining the ranks of Crew GUYS as Mirai Hibino. During the series' run, Ultraman Mebius celebrated the 40th anniversary of Ultra Series, with the setting going back to the Showa Era universe and the titular character meeting with the Ultra Brothers. Aside from that, some of the threats that Mebius/GUYS faced in the series proper were related to the past Ultra Brothers' battles with their adversaries. Despite the declining viewer rate, his series continued to grow popular after the release of Ultraman Mebius & Ultraman Brothers, so much so that the selling rate of toys had achieve a good rate. The guest appearances of the Ultra Brothers in his series proper further boosted the viewer rating, becoming a series that is enjoyable for both children and adults. Ironically, after Ultraman Mebius ended, the Ultra Series entered another period of hiatus. In the series, Mebius is voiced by Shunji Igarashi, who was also Mirai Hibino's actor. His grunts for Mebius were archived afterwards for future appearances. Following Shunji's retirement from the entertainment industry in 2013, Ultraman Mebius was voiced by in later appearances, mostly in game publications. In the series, Mebius' suit actors were and . Character conception =Setting= As a series that celebrated the 40th anniversary of Ultra Series, Ultraman Mebius was set in a world where the Earth has been in a period of peace for about 25 years since the departure of Ultraman 80. The series not only reintroduced characters and Ultra Kaiju from the past (mainly from the phase 2 of the Showa series), but also paid tribute to past incidents that are related to the Showa Era series. Mirai Hibino revealing his alter ego as Ultraman Mebius in the middle of the series was a break from the original tradition of the Ultra Series, where the Ultra/human relation is exposed only in the final arc of the series. Because Ultraman Mebius is depicted as a rookie Ultraman who cooperates with a rookie Earth Defense Team members, the series adopts the element of a developing rookie, with key elements from Ultraman Nexus, such as \\"friendship\\" and \\"bonds\\" in a more universal manner. It is also a coincidence that many of the filming crew members for Nexus, such as Hiroyasu Shibuya participated in the production. Mebius' grunts were originally high pitched in the early series, but starting from episode 23 and onward, they were deepened under the request of supervisor Yuichi Abe in hopes of emphasizing Mebius' growth of character. =Design= Tsushima leopard cat, one of the inspirations for Ultraman Mebius' face Ultraman Mebius was designed by Hiroshi Maruyama, who based it on the original unused design of Ultraman Nexus, called . His face is designed in a resemblance to Tsushima leopard cat. In contrast to more recent Ultra Warriors, Mebius lacked any decorations on his forehead (e.g. Beam Lamp). His Protector chest features the combined use of materials such as FRP and Polyurethane, thus becoming the foundation for his Color Timer to be covered by said organ. His Mebius Brace had its design motif revolve around fire and was proposed to be the original location of said Mebius's Color Timer, as original sketching featured him with the lack of aforementioned device on his chest. Other forms of Mebius also include: *Mebius Burning Brave: This form is designed after the original Ultraman himself. *Mebius Infinity: This form design was made simultaneously with the original Mebius (which was completed sooner) and incorporated many of the rejected designs from Ultraman Nexus. *Mebius Phoenix Brave: The idea of having Mebius combine with Ultraman Hikari and Crew GUYS was already in conception since the beginning of the series, although the initial plan was for them to merge with members of the Ultra Brothers, which was only demonstrated with Sakomizu bonding with Zoffy. =Naming= His name \\"Mebius\\" is related to the M√∂bius strip, further associating the Ultraman to his main design motif, the infinity symbol (‚àû). History =Ultraman Mebius= Mebius was a rookie member of the Space Garrison, who was bestowed the Mebius Brace and sent to Earth by the Father of Ultra as the next Ultraman to guard it. Sometime before his arrival, he encountered an astronaut named Hiroto Ban, who sacrificed himself to save his father and the entire ship's crew from being sucked into a wormhole that entered the Ultra Zone. Mebius tried to reach the man in the last minute but failed and decided to use his image in hopes of honoring his sacrifice, while the naming his human form Mirai came from Hiroto's father, Tetsuro. In the beginning of the series, Mebius encountered Bogar, who orchestrated several of the monster attacks in the early arc of the series. The Earth was attacked by Dinozaur, the first monster attack recorded since Margodon from 25 years prior (Ultraman 80). With all Crew GUYS except Ryu Aihara eliminated, the monster made its way to Earth and continued to rampage. Mebius fought against the invader and won but was chastised by Ryu for not only using the buildings as shields, but also for being unable to minimize the collateral damage from the battle. After joining Crew GUYS, now led by veteran Shingo Sakomizu, Mirai recruited the civilians he encountered earlier (Teppei, George, Marina and Konomi) after witnessing them saving the kindergarten rabbits. From that day on, Mebius/Mirai cooperated with GUYS in saving the Earth from monsters and alien threats while both Ultra and attack team begin to experience character development, from newcomers of their respective fields to experts. Mebius also clashes with Hunter Knight Tsurugi, a scientist from his own kind who bonded with former GUYS captain Serizawa and hunts Bogar to avenge the destruction of Planet Aarb. After putting aside their differences, the two managed to defeat Bogar and for Tsurugi to free himself from his armor while renaming himself as Hikari by Ryu. Before leaving Earth, Hikari entrusted Mebius with the Knight Brace, allowing the young warrior to assume Mebius Brave. In the middle of the series, a mysterious invasion group made their move on Earth by sending their scout, Inpelaizer. This was after his battle with Nova, when Mebius was called back by the Space Garrison, due to the threat being too strong for him. Unable to defy the Father of Ultra's orders, Mirai spent his last day on the Earth with the Crew GUYS members. While visiting Ryu on his day off, Mirai revealed his true identity to him before fighting the Inpelaizer. His instructor, Taro, was sent to continue the fight before Mebius fell due to exhaustion. After being treated at the Phoenix Nest, Mirai told Ryu of his people's background before disappearing. He watched GUYS and Taro's efforts to hold off the Inpelaizer, from the sidelines. Despite being ordered not to fight, Mirai transformed in front of his teammates and fought alongside his instructor. Despite, collapsing from his injury, his bond with Crew GUYS brought forth Mebius Burning Brave, successfully destroying the robot for the final time. Taro decided to approve Mebius' request to stay, seeing how his bonds with the earthlings helped him counter the threat. During Hikari's reappearance, Mebius returned the Knight Brace and witnessed his battle against Alien Babarue, while unmasking the impostor to restore his reputation. Soon he faced many threats that were related to the same invader that sent Inpelaizer, including the group dubbed the \\"Dark Four Heavenly Kings\\", serving the dark lord known as \\"the Emperor\\". With his battles nearing to a close, the support he gained from GUYS and members of the Ultra Brothers helped him to move forward. In the finale, Mebius' identity was exposed to the public and \\"the emperor\\" demanded Earth to surrender Mebius in exchange for their safety. While the civilians turn their backs on the Ultra, Sakomizu's words caused them to change their mind. Seeing this, the Inpelaizer troops was sent to attack Mebius and the Crew GUYS before they were supported by Hikari and their alien allies. The true mastermind revealed himself as Alien Empera, the infamous villain who once led an invasion on the Land of Light and fought in a deathmatch against the Father of Ultra. He easily thwarted all resistance and covered the Earth in darkness by covering the entire sun. With Crew GUYS not giving up, Ryu (who was now bonded with Ultraman Hikari) and the entire Crew GUYS resonated with Mirai into Mebius Phoenix Brave, while Sakomizu sent down the Spacium Redoublizer to boost the combined Ultra's attack before bonding with Zoffy and joining the fray. Following Empera's destruction, Mirai bid farewell to his teammates and returned to the Land of Light. His battles on Earth earned him a membership in . =Ultraman Mebius & Ultraman Brothers= Sometime before episode 23, Mirai was sent on a mission in Kobe, meeting Aya and Takato, a boy who lost his faith in Ultra Warriors due to an incident involving Cherubim. After fighting Alien Temperor as Mebius, Mirai met the original Ultra Brothers in their human forms, who then told him of humanity's nature. Later Mirai was poisoned by Zarab in order for the latter to impersonate Mebius and wreak havoc in Kobe until Mebius reappear and destroyed his impostor. But with his energy running out, Alien Guts crucified him in mid-air and quarantined the whole city to bring out the Ultra Brothers. Despite them showing up and defeated Guts and Nackle to free Mebius, the victory was short lived when the two aliens imprisoned them instead, leaving Mebius to revert to his human form out of exhaustion. Regaining his strength, Mirai transformed and challenged the aliens before freeing the Ultra Brothers. As it turned out, their usurped energies were used to lift the seal that had imprisoned Yapool and U-Killersaurus a long time ago with Nackle, the last alien left, being eliminated after his service has no longer needed. The Ultra Brothers were joined and replenished by Zoffy and Taro in the battle. Seeing the monster holding Aya as a hostage, the Ultra Brothers fused with Mebius into Mebius Infinity, successfully destroying U-Killersaururs Neo and freeing its captive. In the aftermath, Mirai returned to the Phoenix Nest with Zoffy and Taro flying pass. =Ultraman Mebius Side Story: Hikari Saga= A side story that focused on Ultraman Hikari, Mebius was mentioned several times by said Ultra Warrior. In SAGA 3, Alien Babarue briefly impersonated Mebius to lure Hikari to Planet Aarb. =Superior Ultraman 8 Brothers= Taking place around episode 32 of the series, Mirai/Mebius was sent to an alternate universe by a girl in red shoes, who sought his help. Mebius first appeared in Daigo's dream where he battled against King Guesra and succeeded with Daigo's help. Meeting the civilian in his human form, Mirai was brought to the alternate counterparts of Showa Ultras human form but realized they were normal humans. After fighting against King Pandon, Mebius was then imprisoned and petrified by Super Alien Hipporit, leaving the Earth with little to no resistance. It wasn't until Daigo, Asuka and Gamu transformed into Ultra Warriors, followed by the alternate Showa Ultras who would later free Mebius, that he rejoined the battle. After destroying the dark mastermind, Mirai returned to his original universe while saluting Daigo and the alternate Ultra Warriors. In this movie, a new suit for Ultraman Mebius was specifically made instead of reusing the original one from TV series. =Ultraman Mebius Side Story: Armored Darkness= After Hikari failed to exterminate Armored Darkness, Mebius was sent to fight against the giant armor but due to fighting in the Darkness Fear, his energy slowly weakened. When Hikari regained consciousness, he briefly paralyzed the armor in place for Mebius to steal the Darkness Broad (a sword) and slash its helmet, causing the armor to deactivate. When comforting a remorse Haruzaki, Mebius/Mirai revealed that Ryu had been saved by Ultraman King and with the Crew GUYS arriving, they hatched a plan to save Hikari, which was not only successful but also destroyed the armor. But as it reformed again, both Ultra Warriors fought him to a standstill before combining into Mebius Phoenix Brave, using the taken Darkness Broad to leave a huge gap and fire Mebium Knight Shoot. Mebius the teleported Crew GUYS away from Darkness Fear while Hikari took it to the Land of Light to be destroyed. Mirai was given the permission to stay on Earth for a while longer, allowing him to have a proper reunion with his friends. =Ultraman Mebius Side Story: Ghost Reverse= Prior to the events of Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy, Mebius joined Taro and Ace in a fight against the revived Heavenly Kings until they were captured, with Hikari defecting to their side. In order to save his brothers in arms, Mebius was sent to the Valley of the Flames to retrieve the Giga Battle Nizer. He was joined by Mechazam, a robot that he met before who wanted to follow Mebius' path of being stronger. The two soon fought against EX Zetton and managed to both get the Battle Nizer and defeat the monster but Mechazam sacrificed himself to save Mebius from falling lava. Returning to surface, Hikari exposes his cover and saved Taro and Ace allowing the Ultra Warriors to fight back. When Alien Mefilas revived Mechazam as Ghost Reverse and docked the Battle Nizer to revive Alien Empera, Mebius faced the dilemma of destroying his newfound friend until Mechazam reassured him, allowing Mebius to carry out his duty. =Subsequent history= *Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy (2009): Following Belial's escape, Ultraman Mebius was among a number of Ultra Warriors that tried to stop Belial from advancing to the Plasma Spark.

His favorite Ultra Warrior is the title character of Ultraman Tiga, having watched the series at the age of 10 years old and was excited to portray alongside Hiroshi Nagano, Daigo Madoka's actor in Superior Ultraman 8 Brothers. Shunji initially had no knowledge of swimming until the recording of episode 4, which involves a scene Mirai diving into the pool to retrieve Konomi's glasses.

Functional regression models can be classified into four types depending on whether the responses or covariates are functional or scalar: (i) scalar responses with functional covariates, (ii) functional responses with scalar covariates, (iii) functional responses with functional covariates, and (iv) scalar or functional responses with functional and scalar covariates. In addition, functional regression models can be linear, partially linear, or nonlinear. In particular, functional polynomial models, functional single and multiple index models and functional additive models are three special cases of functional nonlinear models. TOC  Functional linear models (FLMs)  Functional linear models (FLMs) are an extension of linear models (LMs). A linear model with scalar response Yinmathbb{R} and scalar covariates Xinmathbb{R}^p can be written as where langlecdot,cdotrangle denotes the inner product in Euclidean space, beta_0inmathbb{R} and betainmathbb{R}^p denote the regression coefficients, and varepsilon is a random error with mean zero and finite variance. FLMs can be divided into two types based on the responses. = Functional linear models with scalar responses = Functional linear models with scalar responses can be obtained by replacing the scalar covariates X and the coefficient vector beta in model () by a centered functional covariate X^c(cdot) = X(cdot) - mathbb{E}(X(cdot)) and a coefficient function beta = beta(cdot) with domain mathcal{T}, respectively, and replacing the inner product in Euclidean space by that in Hilbert space L^2, where langle cdot, cdot rangle here denotes the inner product in L^2. One approach to estimating beta_0 and beta(cdot) is to expand the centered covariate X^c(cdot) and the coefficient function beta(cdot) in the same functional basis, for example, B-spline basis or the eigenbasis used in the Karhunen- Lo√®ve expansion. Suppose {phi_k}_{k=1}^infty is an orthonormal basis of L^2. Expanding X^c and beta in this basis, X^c(cdot) = sum_{k=1}^infty x_k phi_k(cdot), beta(cdot) = sum_{k=1}^infty beta_k phi_k(cdot), model () becomes Y = beta_0 + sum_{k=1}^infty beta_k x_k +varepsilon. For implementation, regularization is needed and can be done through truncation, L^2 penalization or L^1 penalization.Morris (2015). \\"Functional regression\\". Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application. 2:321-359. doi:10.1146/annurev-statistics-010814-020413. In addition, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) approach can also be used to estimate beta_0 and beta(cdot) in model ()Yuan and Cai (2010). \\"A reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach to functional linear regression\\". The Annals of Statistics. 38 (6):3412-3444. doi:10.1214/09-AOS772. Adding multiple functional and scalar covariates, model () can be extended to where Z_1,ldots,Z_q are scalar covariates with Z_1=1, alpha_1,ldots,alpha_q are regression coefficients for Z_1,ldots,Z_q, respectively, X^c_j is a centered functional covariate given by X_j^c(cdot) = X_j(cdot) - mathbb{E}(X_j(cdot)), beta_j is regression coefficient function for X_j^c(cdot), and mathcal{T}_j is the domain of X_j and beta_j, for j=1,ldots,p. However, due to the parametric component alpha, the estimation methods for model () cannot be used in this caseWang, Chiou and M√ºller (2016). \\"Functional data analysis\\".

Functional data analysis, 2nd ed., New York: Springer, . One of these two models is of the form beta(s,t) X^c(s),ds + varepsilon(t), text{for} tinmathcal{T},}} where X^c(cdot) = X(cdot) - mathbb{E}(X(cdot)) is still the centered functional covariate, beta_0(cdot) and beta(cdot,cdot) are coefficient functions, and varepsilon(cdot) is usually assumed to be a random process with mean zero and finite variance. In this case, at any given time tinmathcal{T}, the value of Y, i.e., Y(t), depends on the entire trajectory of X. Model (), for any given time t, is an extension of multivariate linear regression with the inner product in Euclidean space replaced by that in L^2. An estimating equation motivated by multivariate linear regression is r_{XY} = R_{XX}beta, text{ for } betain L^2(mathcal{S}timesmathcal{S}), where r_{XY}(s,t) = text{cov}(X(s),Y(t)), R_{XX}: L^2(mathcal{S}timesmathcal{S}) rightarrow L^2(mathcal{S}timesmathcal{T}) is defined as (R_{XX}beta)(s,t) = int_mathcal{S} r_{XX}(s,w)beta(w,t)dw with r_{XX}(s,w) = text{cov}(X(s),X(w)) for s,winmathcal{S}. Regularization is needed and can be done through truncation, L^2 penalization or L^1 penalization. Various estimation methods for model () are available.Ramsay and Dalzell (1991). \\"Some tools for functional data analysis\\". Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological). 53 (3):539-572. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345586.Yao, M√ºller and Wang (2005). \\"Functional linear regression analysis for longitudinal data\\". The Annals of Statistics. 33 (6):2873-2903. doi:10.1214/009053605000000660. When X and Y are concurrently observed, i.e., mathcal{S}=mathcal{T},Grenander (1950). \\"Stochastic processes and statistical inference\\". Arkiv Matematik. 1 (3):195-277. doi:10.1007/BF02590638. it is reasonable to consider a historical functional linear model, where the current value of Y only depends on the history of X, i.e., beta(s,t)=0 for s>t in model ().Malfait and Ramsay (2003). \\"The historical functional linear model\\". Canadian Journal of Statistics. 31 (2):115-128. doi:10.2307/3316063. A simpler version of the historical functional linear model is the functional concurrent model (see below). Adding multiple functional covariates, model () can be extended to where for j=1,ldots,p, X_j^c(cdot)=X_j(cdot) - mathbb{E}(X_j(cdot)) is a centered functional covariate with domain mathcal{S}_j, and beta_j(cdot,cdot) is the corresponding coefficient function with the same domain, respectively. In particular, taking X_j(cdot) as a constant function yields a special case of model () Y(t) = sum_{j=1}^p X_j beta_j(t) + varepsilon(t), text{for} tinmathcal{T}, which is a FLM with functional responses and scalar covariates.  Functional concurrent models  Assuming that mathcal{S} = mathcal{T}, another model, known as the functional concurrent model, sometimes also referred to as the varying-coefficient model, is of the form where alpha_0 and alpha are coefficient functions. Note that model () assumes the value of Y at time t, i.e., Y(t), only depends on that of X at the same time, i.e., X(t). Various estimation methods can be applied to model ().Fan and Zhang (1999). \\"Statistical estimation in varying coefficient models\\".

Adding multiple functional covariates, model () can also be extended to Y(t) = alpha_0(t) + sum_{j=1}^palpha_j(t)X_j(t)+varepsilon(t), text{for} tinmathcal{T}, where X_1,ldots,X_p are multiple functional covariates with domain mathcal{T} and alpha_0,alpha_1,ldots,alpha_p are the coefficient functions with the same domain.  Functional nonlinear models  = Functional polynomial models = Functional polynomial models are an extension of the FLMs with scalar responses, analogous to extending linear regression to polynomial regression. For a scalar response Y and a functional covariate X(cdot) with domain mathcal{T}, the simplest example of functional polynomial models is functional quadratic regressionYao and M√ºller (2010). \\"Functional quadratic regression\\". Biometrika. 97 (1):49-64. doi:10.1093/biomet/asp069. Y = alpha + int_mathcal{T}beta(t)X^c(t),dt + int_mathcal{T} int_mathcal{T} gamma(s,t) X^c(s)X^c(t) ,ds,dt + varepsilon, where X^c(cdot) = X(cdot) - mathbb{E}(X(cdot)) is the centered functional covariate, alpha is a scalar coefficient, beta(cdot) and gamma(cdot,cdot) are coefficient functions with domains mathcal{T} and mathcal{T}timesmathcal{T}, respectively, and varepsilon is a random error with mean zero and finite variance. By analogy to FLMs with scalar responses, estimation of functional polynomial models can be obtained through expanding both the centered covariate X^c and the coefficient functions beta and gamma in an orthonormal basis. = Functional single and multiple index models = A functional multiple index model is given by Y = gleft(int_{mathcal{T}} X^c(t) beta_1(t),dt, ldots, int_{mathcal{T}} X^c(t) beta_p(t),dt right) + varepsilon. Taking p=1 yields a functional single index model. However, for p>1, this model is problematic due to curse of dimensionality. With p>1 and relatively small sample sizes, the estimator given by this model often has large variance.Chen, Hall and M√ºller (2011). \\"Single and multiple index functional regression models with nonparametric link\\". The Annals of Statistics. 39 (3):1720-1747. doi:10.1214/11-AOS882. An alternative p-component functional multiple index model can be expressed as Y = g_1left(int_{mathcal{T}} X^c(t) beta_1(t),dtright)+ cdots+ g_pleft(int_{mathcal{T}} X^c(t) beta_p(t),dt right) + varepsilon. Estimation methods for functional single and multiple index models are available.Jiang and Wang (2011). \\"Functional single index models for longitudinal data\\". 39 (1):362-388. doi:10.1214/10-AOS845. = Functional additive models (FAMs) = Given an expansion of a functional covariate X with domain mathcal{T} in an orthonormal basis {phi_k}_{k=1}^infty: X(t) = sum_{k=1}^infty x_k phi_k(t), a functional linear model with scalar responses shown in model () can be written as mathbb{E}(YX)=mathbb{E}(Y) + sum_{k=1}^infty beta_k x_k. One form of FAMs is obtained by replacing the linear function of x_k, i.e., beta_k x_k, by a general smooth function f_k, mathbb{E}(YX)=mathbb{E}(Y) + sum_{k=1}^infty f_k(x_k), where f_k satisfies mathbb{E}(f_k(x_k))=0 for kinmathbb{N}.M√ºller and Yao (2008). \\"Functional additive models\\". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 103 (484):1534-1544. doi:10.1198/016214508000000751. Another form of FAMs consists of a sequence of time-additive models: mathbb{E}(YX(t_1),ldots,X(t_p))=sum_{j=1}^p f_j(X(t_j)), where {t_1,ldots,t_p} is a dense grid on mathcal{T} with increasing size pinmathbb{N}, and f_j(x) = g(t_j,x) with g a smooth function, for j=1,ldots,pFan, James and Radchenko (2015). \\"Functional additive regression\\". The Annals of Statistics. 43 (5):2296-2325. doi:10.1214/15-AOS1346.  Extensions  A direct extension of FLMs with scalar responses shown in model () is to add a link function to create a generalized functional linear model (GFLM) by analogy to extending linear regression to generalized linear regression (GLM), of which the three components are: # Linear predictor eta = beta_0 + int_{mathcal{T}} X^c(t)beta(t),dt; # Variance function text{Var}(YX) = V(mu), where mu = mathbb{E}(YX) is the conditional mean; # Link function g connecting the conditional mean and the linear predictor through mu=g(eta).

His German father named Gerzen Esgerzen died when he was young. Consequently, he lived with his mother Chai Kietkong. When he was young, the wall of his house was full of his drawings. He started his education at Wat Bharomniwat and then changed to Wat Sommanat School and Wat Amarin. His inspiration and passion in art came from his uncle, Lamyai Kietkong, who encouraged him to study art at Poh Chang art and craft school.Rama IX Art Museum Foundation  Occupation  His career path began at the Ministry of Education. As a government officer, he was assigned as an Instructor at Bann Somdej Teachers' College. After that, he moved to Sartiwithaya School and then Suansunandha School. During World War II every school in Thailand was shut down including Suansunandha School where Chamras worked. Subsequently, he spent time in that period painting with his friend at the Fine Arts Department. Criticized by Silpa Bhirasri (Corrado Feroci), his work gradually improved in both skill and style. He moved to the Fine Arts Department at the suggestion of its former Deputy Director-General, Thanit Yupho.  Technique  He mostly used oil- based paint and chalk color. His focus of interest lay in human portraiture and figures.  Fame and reputation  Chamras received numerous awards and exhibitions during his lifetime.

They live exclusively in certain saline environments of Australia's interior, including coastal beaches, mound springs, clay pans, and salt lakes. There haven't been enough studies to establish a conservation status, but some species have only been found in solitary salt lakes, suggesting that the increase of mining, agriculture, recreational, and similar disturbances of these unique ecosystems may eventually lead to their extinction if not properly regulated.

Nowadays, plastic is used for making it lighter and more convenient to throw.  Rules  1. The players are not allowed to touch the other piece at all during the thrown up steps. 2. The players must not miss catching the leader at any steps. 3. The player must pick up the correct number of stone in each step.  How to play  At the beginning of the game, all of the players need to start by throwing all five stones individually upward and catching them with the hand backwards. The person who catches the most stone, which called Mak in the game, is the first to start the game. # The first player throws all of Mak(stones) on the floor. Pick the one up ( This Mak is called the leader) on the floor. Toss the leader Mak up during the throwing player need to pick up one piece on the floor before catching the leader mid- air. Then repeat for all of the Mak pieces on the floor one by one on steps. # Repeat the previous step but pick up two pieces at a time. # Repeat the first step again but pick three pieces first and pick the left one later. # For the last step, the player needs to pick four pieces at one time. The winner of the game is the player who can pick all of the steps in one time. If the players fail before finishing all the steps, they must allow the next person to play.

He was known also as a reforming farmer and collector, as well as for his knowledge of Welsh history. Life He was born at Bagillt in Flintshire, Wales, the son of Paul Panton or Patton (died 1762), and his wife Margaret Griffith. He was educated at Westminster School, admitted at Lincoln's Inn in 1744, and matriculated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1746. In 1749 he was called to the bar, and went into practice. Panton was closely involved in the local affairs of both Flintshire and Anglesey. Not a fluent Welsh speaker, he took an interest in Welsh antiquities and associated with the antiquarians Daines Barrington and Thomas Pennant. He died on 24 May 1797. Collection and legacy Panton formed a collection of Welsh manuscripts, in nearly 100 volumes. It included manuscripts left to him by Evan Evans, the poet and antiquarian, on whom Panton had settled an annuity. Those consisted of more than 80 volumes, some of which were old, but mostly transcripts from the Hengwrt Library and Wynnstay archive. Panton's collection at Pl√¢s Gwyn was open to antiquarians. When Panton died in 1797, the manuscripts were left to his son Paul Panton the younger, who allowed the editors of The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales access to them. In 1875 many of the manuscripts were said to be in the possession of Paul Panton, R.N., of Garreglwyd, Holyhead, a descendant. Most of the original collection is now in the National Library of Wales. Family Panton married in 1756 Jane Jones (1725‚Äì1764), daughter of William Jones (1688‚Äì1755) of Plas Gwyn, Pentraeth. They had two sons and two daughters, and the marriage brought him an estate and house in Anglesey. After Jane's death, he married the widow Martha Kirk; they had two sons.

The gaming platform Steam describes it as an \\"action- packed, massively multiplayer space simulation game\\". The core of the game is PvP spaceships battles, PvE (Co-Op) missions and an open world. The game uses a free-to-play business model. Star Conflict has been developed by the Russian company Targem Games (StarGem department) and published by Gaijin Entertainment. The game started on February 1, 2012 and reached open beta test on July 24, 2012. It has been available on Steam since February 27, 2013. The release took place on September 4, 2014 (Version 1.0).

The game has PvP and PvE game modes, as well as an \\"open world\\" sandbox. There is also a \\"Sector Conquest\\" mode, involving corporations (clans). This action space game also has MOBA elements. = PvP mode = Players are divided into two opposing teams and must perform a specific task, such as: capture all the beacons, destroy all enemy ships, etc. There are several PvP modes with different combat missions, terms and conditions. The higher the rank a player's ship is, the more kinds of battles and maps will be available for them. The number of players in each team depending on the game mode varies from 6 to 32. At the start of the battle, the server automatically divides the players into teams according to their level and skill. Players can form their own squad in the lobby and go into the battle in this group. = Open Space = This mode was launched as a large-scale expansion, entitled \\"Invasion\\" on September 4, 2014. According to the storyline, the alien Biomorphs (a new NPC race) invaded known space. To counter this threat, the factions had to mobilize all of the mercenaries (the players). The game world consists of many separate locations, connected by warp gates. It is a mode where players can undock from a station and travel around the various systems and sectors to defend allied space colonies against an ancient and malevolent alien race. In contrast to all other modes, players are given almost complete freedom of action. Players can attack any ship, including the ships of other players, find or steal from other players valuable items, which are used for crafting, completing missions and fighting aliens. Space is inhabited by NPC pirates and aliens. Sectors controlled by factions are guarded by police. There are hidden alien sectors, that can be reached only through special alien gates. = Missions = A co-op PvE mode, where players fight against enemy NPCs and bosses. The missions involve teams of 4 players. Each mission consists of several stages. Each stage may have special conditions. For instance, permanent hull and shield recovery or increased damage power. There are currently 9 scenarios available. A special part of the missions is \\"Spec-Ops\\". It is a raid against giant Alien flagships. There are 3 available scenarios at the moment, where each of the bosses has unique characteristics and behavior. A maximum of 12 players can take part in these missions. = Sector Conquest = Sector Conquest represents epic battles between Corporations, a community of pilots, for conquering and holding a location on the gigantic map with more than 200 sectors. Control over the location grants extra income to the Corporation. Corporations are a mainstay in Star Conflict. Joining a Corporation enters you into a group of players, much like a guild. In order to establish control over open world sectors a corporation has to build a Dreadnought. Dreadnoughts are huge ships with destructive fire-power. They have a variety of systems, which can be constructed and damaged in combat, for example their different weapons: torpedoes, combat drones and guns of various calibers. These massive ships and their immense damage output are perfect for interstellar PvP battles. = Custom Battle = Pilots can create a battle with their own settings. They can play against NPCs or other players that can be invited by the host. Battles with custom settings in the PvP mode do not bring players any income, and are mostly used for training, holding tournaments or other events.  Spaceships  There are 4 basic ship classes: interceptors, fighters, frigates and destroyers. They are fundamentally different in external view, size, control, speed, etc. Each class has a variety of different modules available, weapons and features, designed for certain tasks. These variations determine the role of the ship on the battlefield. * Interceptors - The smallest and fastest ships in the game. They have little armor, but they successfully compensate for this drawback with effective maneuvering, powerful equipment and high speed. There are 3 roles for these craft: ECM ships, Recon ships and Covert Ops. * Fighters - These ships are of medium size, and have increased survivability. They possess powerful weapons, but are inferior in speed and maneuverability to interceptors. The roles of these are Command ships, Gunships and Tacklers. * Frigates - These are big and slow ships. They have enhanced armor and powerful weapons. There are Engineering ships (buffers), Long Range ships (snipers) and Guard ships (tanks). * Destroyers - Extra large ships with a paltry speed. Superior to other classes of ships in all respects, except for the speed and maneuverability. Depending on the model of the destroyer, they can simultaneously use 2-8 guns. The modules resemble turrets, which provide many more ways to inflict damage to your enemies. These modules however, can be disabled if they receive too much damage.

Some reasons for why the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization act was created was because of: * A handful of fish stocks has declined to the point of their survival being threatened * To make it possible for small fishing companies to compete with massive fishing fleets * Failure to prevent or terminate overfishing of the International fishery agreement * To provide optimal yields on a continuing basis to preserve and maintain fisheries  National Standard 1 - Optimum Yield  The National Standard 1 pertains: * Providing Stability for Fisheries * Adding Flexibility to rebuilding plans * Updating optimal yield and maximum sustainable yield concepts * Improving guidance on managing data-limit stocks * Consolidating guidance on identifying stocks to be included in federal fishery management plans * Provisions to further advance ecosystem-based fisheries management  National Standard 2 - Scientific Information  The counsel may decide to allow this type of overfishing if the fishery is not overfished and if all of the following lower conditions are satisfied: * Such action will result in longterm net benefits to the Nation * Mitigating measures have been considered and it has been demonstrated that a similar level of longterm net benefits cannot be achieved by modifying fleet behavior, gear selection/configuration, or other technical characteristic in a manner such that no overfishing would occur * The resulting rate of fishing mortality will not cause any stock or stock complex to fall below its MSST more than 50 percent of the time in the long term, although it is recognized that persistent overfishing is expected to cause the affected stock to fall below its Bmsy more than 50 percent of the time in the long term.  National Standard 3 - Management Units  The SAFE report provides information to the Councils for determining annual harvest levels for each stock. To the extent practicable, an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination. National Standard 3 is to induce a comprehensive approach to fishery management. The geographic scope of the fishery, for planning purposes, should cover the entire range of the stocks of fish and to not be overly constrained by Political boundaries. Whenever possible, an Fishery Management Plan should manage interrelated stocks of fish.  National Standard 4 - Allocations  Defined by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Allocation is \\"a direct and deliberate distribution of the opportunity to participate in a fishery among identifiable, discrete user groups or individuals\\" National Standard 4 pertains to the conservation and management measures avoiding discrimination between residents of different states. If it is or becomes necessary to assign fishing privileges among various U.S. fishermen, such allocation shall be: # Fair and equitable to all such fishermen # Reasonably calculated to promote conservation # Managed in a manner that no particular individual, corporation or other entity squires an excessive share of such privileges An Fishery Management Plan may not differentiate amount U.S. citizens, nationals, resident aliens, or corporations on the basis of their state or residence.  National Standard 5 - Efficiency  Conservation and Management measures shall, where practicable, consider efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources; except that no measure shall have economic allocation of its sole purpose. The term \\"utilization\\", is meant to be interpreted as; harvesting, processing, marketing, and nonconsumptive use of the resource. In theory, an efficient fishery would harvest the optimal yield with the minimum use of economic inputs as labor, capital, interest and fuel. This standard highlights one process that a fishery can/should contribute to the planet's benefit with a low effect society: * Given a set of objectives for the fishery, an Fishery Management Plan should contain management measures that result in as efficient a fishery as is practicable or desirable. Another efficient Fishery Management Plan includes: * Management Plan that allows a fishery to manage at the lowest cost possible (e.g., fishing effort, administration and enforcement) for a particular level of catch and initial size  National Standard 6 - Variations and Contingencies  Conservation and management measures shall take into account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, fishery resources, and catch. The phrase \\"Conservation and management\\" implies the wise use of fishery resources through a management plan that includes some protection against the following uncertainties: Timely respond to resource, industry, and other national and regional needs. Fishery Management Plans should consist of a suitable impact in favor of conservation. Allowances for uncertainties should be factored into the backbone of a Fishery Management Plan. Examples include: * Reduce optimal yield from lack of information of a stock * Establish a reserve as the creation of a reserve may include uncertainties in estimating domestic harvest, stock conditions, or environmental factors * Adjust management techniques as a council could guard against producing drastic changes in fishing patterns, allocations, or practices * Highlight habitat conditions as knowing the original habitat condition can help address the impacts of pollution and habitat degradation * Contingencies can establish a flexible management plan that contains a range of management options for unpredicted events (e.g., unexpected resource surges or failures, fishing effort greater than expected, disruptive gear conflicts)  National Standard 7 - Costs and Benefits  Conservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication. The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires Councils to prepare Fishery Management Plans for overfished fisheries and for other fisheries where regulation will be beneficial according to cost whether its in the present or future. The following factors shall be considered, among others to implement an Fishery Management Plan: * The importance of fishery to the Nation and to the regional economy * The condition of the stock or stocks of fish and whether an Fishery Management Plan can improve or maintain that condition * The extent to which the fishery could be or is already adequately managed by states, by state/Federal programs, by Federal regulations pursuant to Fishery Management Plans or inter nation commissions, or by industry self-regulation, consistent with the policies and standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. * The need to resolve competing interests and conflicts among user groups and whether an Fishery Management Plan can further that resolution * The economic condition of a fishery and whether an Fishery Management Plan can produce more efficient utilization * The needs of a developing fishery, and whether an Fishery Management Plan can foster orderly growth * The costs associated with an Fishery Management Plan, balanced against the benefits  National Standard 8 - Communities  Conservation and Management measures shall, consistent with the conservation requirements with the Magnuson-Stevens Act (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data that are based upon the best scientific information available in order to: # Provide for the sustained participation of such communities; and # To the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities. This standard is meant to take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities from an Fishery Management Plan. This consideration, however, is within the context of the conservation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Careful consideration regarding the importance of fishery resources to affected fishing communities, thus, must not compromise the achievement of conservation requirements and goals of the Fishery Management Plan.  National Standard 9 - Bycatch  Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable: # Minimize bycatch; and # To the extent by catch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality of such bycatch. The term \\"bycatch\\" is to be interpreted as fish that are harvested in a fishery, but are not sold or kept for personal use. National Standard 9 requires Councils to consider the bycatch effects of existing and planned conservation and management measures. Bycatch may delay or prevent efforts to protect marine ecosystems, efforts to achieve sustainable fisheries and delay or prevent the full benefits they may provide to the Nation. Bycatch can increase substantially the uncertainty concerning total fishing-related mortality, which increases difficulty to assess the status of stocks, to set the appropriate Optimal Yield and define overfishing levels. and to ensure that Optimal Yields are attained and overfishing levels are not exceeded. Bycatch may also preclude other more productive uses of fishery resources.  National Standard 10 - Safety of Life at Sea  Conservation and management measures shall, to the extent practicable, promote the safety of human life at sea. National Standard 10 promotes Councils to reduce the risk in crafting their management measures. If the management measures can meet the other national standards and the legal and practical requirements of conservation and management then there should be no problem. This standard is not meant to give preference to one method of managing a fishery over another. Non-inclusive list of safety considerations that shall be considered in evaluating management measures under national standard 10: # Operating environment shall be put into consideration of a Fishing Management Plan that should try to avoid creating situations resulting in vessels going out further, fishing longer, or fishing in weather worse than if there were no management measures. # Gear and vessel loading requirements shall be put into consideration of an Fishing Management Plan that should consider the safety and stability of fishing vessels when required specific gear or requiring the removal of gear from the water. # Limited season and area fisheries shall be put into consideration of an Fishing Management Plan that should attempt to reduce the impacts of fisherman fishing in bad weather and overlaid their vessel with catch and/or gear.

It was formerly placed in the genus Haworthia, as Haworthia pumila or Haworthia maxima. Description It is an evergreen, winter-growing succulent plant with sharp succulent leaves arranged in rosettes of 20 cm in diameter. The leaves are hard, upright, sometimes incurved and are usually covered with raised white tubercles. It is a variable species, with different populations differing in the leaf shape, colour, growth form and tubercles. It also varies according to environment, and in direct sun during the dry summer, it can assume a red colour. The leaves usually have an olive-green to brown colour. In the summer (November to December) Tulista pumila produces pink-white tubular flowers, on a tall thin inflorescence. Naming and taxonomy The eponymy of this species has been relatively complex. It was previously named Haworthia maxima or Haworthia pumila. In some old records it is also occasionally listed as Haworthia margaritifera.R. Mottram: Haworthia pumila, margaritifera, or what? Haworthiad Vol.14(1)22-24pp. 2000. It is the largest of the Tulista species (reaching up to 30 cm in height), and is classed with the other large species (T.marginata, T.minima & T.kingiana) in the \\"Robustipedunculares\\" subgenus. Following recent phylogenetic studies, it has been shown that these four species in fact constitute a distinct out-group, separate from other Haworthias. They were therefore classed as a separate genus, \\"Tulista\\".Manning, J.C., Boatwright, J.S., Daru, B.H., Maurin, O. and Van der Bank, M. 2014.

It also extends north-east as far as Laingsburg. Here is occurs in Karoo scrub. Cultivation A small specimen of Tulista pumila in cultivation, South Africa It is a popular plant in cultivation, though it can be slow-growing. It is not known how long the plants live for, but some specimens have been kept in captivity for over 40 years. The plant requires well-drained soil, and it is one of the few Tulista species that thrives in full sun. The plant rarely offsets, so most propagation is by seed, though leaf cuttings can also be rooted when larger leaves are used.

Academic career in Australia Bodi taught German and history at the Melbourne Grammar School for two years (1957‚Äì58) and then was a lecturer at the University College, Newcastle, New South Wales. In 1961 he returned to Melbourne to take up an appointment as Senior Lecturer at Monash University. In 1963 he was appointed as the Foundation Professor of German at the same university, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1987. During those years as professor he would also occupy several research positions, mainly in Vienna, but also at Berlin, Budapest, Frankfurt am Main, Paris and Siegen. He was also visiting professor at universities in Vienna, Graz and Berlin. Legacy Appointed in 1963 to set up the new German studies department at Monash University, Bodi implemented a broad curriculum that included not only the traditional study of German language and literature but also the \\"political, social and cultural history of the German-speaking lands\\". He actively and rapidly recruited new young staff, many of whom, including the linguist Michael Clyne and the Germanist David Roberts, went on to complete \\"doctorates under his supervision\\". He used Monash University's new budget to build up an \\"outstanding collection\\" of books and other resources in the university library. He emphasised that German culture and studied were \\"pluricentric\\" and so he taught not only Germany but also Austria whose literature and language he viewed as \\"autonomous\\". He also promoted the study of the literature and culture of the German Democratic Republic and more generally of \\"emerging European writers and movements\\". Bodi's own academic research included pioneering work on German-Australian connections, including on the naturalist and ethnologist Georg Forster, who went on James Cook's second voyage to the Pacific, and on the Enlightenment in Austria, writing a book Tauwetter in Wien (Thaw in Vienna) which has become a standard work. He produced bibliographies on German Australiana and German culture held in Melbourne libraries. Personal life Leslie Bodi married Marianna \\"Marianne\\" Marton in 1950. They had one daughter, Anna.

It is the sixth anime spin-off in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise. The series aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from May 10, 2017 to September 25, 2019. It is being simulcast outside of Asia by Crunchyroll courtesy of Konami Cross Media NY. The series was succeeded by Yu- Gi-Oh! Sevens, which premiered in Japan on April 4, 2020. The term 'VRAINS' derives from 'Virtual Reality' (VR), 'Artificial Intelligence' (AI), 'Network System' (NS). Synopsis In a place known as Den City, thousands of duelists take part in a virtual reality space known as LINK VRAINS, created by SOL Technologies, where users can create unique avatars and participate in games of Duel Monsters with each other. As a mysterious hacker organization known as the Knights of Hanoi, led by Varis, threatens this world, a high-school student and hacking genius named Yusaku Fujiki battles against them under the guise of Playmaker. Both the Knights and SOL Technologies are also after a peculiar self-aware artificial intelligence program, who holds the key to a secret area inside the network named the Cyberse World, which the Knights of Hanoi seek to destroy. As the series begins, Yusaku sees the chance to capture this AI, which he names Ai, who sets off a digital maelstrom in LINK VRAINS known as the Data Storm. As the appearance of this storm gives birth to Speed Duels, in which duelists surf the wind as they duel, Yusaku battles against Hanoi in order to uncover the truth concerning an incident that happened to him 10 years ago. With the help of two Charisma Duelists, The Gore and Blue Angel, Playmaker is able to defeat Varis, saving the entire network and part ways with Ai who decides to return to his own world, the Cyberse World. Three months after Hanoi's fall, Ai discovers the Cyberse World destroyed and his friends nowhere to be found, prompting him to return to Yusaku. Meanwhile, Yusaku once again fights as Playmaker after the consciousness of the younger brother of his friend, Cal Kolter, is stolen by a mysterious enemy named Bohman. In pursuit of Bohman, Yusaku and Ai are joined by Theodore Hamilton, a victim of the Lost Incident like Yusaku who uses the alias of Soulburner online and Ai's Fire Ignis friend based on Theodore, Flame. Aqua, the Water Ignis, follows soon after by becoming Skye's partner. At the same time, Varis revives Knights of Hanoi to fight against the new enemies. It's revealed that Bohman is a sentient AI created by the Light Ignis, Lightning, who reveals that he's the one who destroyed the Cyberse World and steals Cal's brother's consciousness. Deeming Ignis superior, he decides to destroy humanity. The Wind Ignis, Windy, also assists Lightning after his program was forcefully rewritten. To defeat Lightning's team, Yusaku and his friends join forces with Hanoi and enters Lightning's stronghold. Both sides fights until only Playmaker, Ai, and Bohman are left with the latter having absorbed all other Ignis. Before perishing, Flame and Aqua gives Ai the last of their powers, allowing him and Playmaker to defeat Bohman. After the fight against Bohman, LINK VRAINS is shut down and Ai disappear together with Yusaku's robot, Roboppi. Replacing LINK VRAINS, SOL Technology develops a humanoid robot SOLtis, which Ai and Roboppi uses to infiltrate SOL Technology and attack its high executive, Queen. Knowing he'll be the next target, Skye's older brother, Akira, enlists the help of Playmaker and his friends as well as Hanoi once more to protect him. Ai and Roboppi manage to defeat everyone except Playmaker, Soulburner, and Varis, who are forced to fight decoys. After defeating Akira and taking over SOL Technology, Ai reopens LINK VRAINS and delivers a message for Playmaker that tells the whereabout of his location. Yusaku confronts Ai alone, leading the two of them to duel. Ai explains that Lightning left behind a simulation that shows the world will be destroyed if Ai is the only Ignis left. Fearing that he'll become like Lightning and Bohman, Ai decides to end his life by either by Playmaker's hand if he lose or by scattering his data into the SOLtis if he win. Despite Playmaker's attempt to dissuade Ai, he still refuses to back down, forcing Playmaker to defeat him. In his last moment, Ai reveals that within the simulations, Yusaku always ends up dying protecting him, which is a future that he wishes to avoid. Months after the final battle, everyone moves on with their lives and Yusaku goes on a journey. Somewhere within the network, Ai is revealed to be alive. Production Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS was first announced on December 16, 2016. It began airing on TV Tokyo in Japan on May 10, 2017. The series is being directed by Masahiro Hosoda at Studio Gallop with screenplay by Shin Yoshida and character design by Ken'ichi Hara. The series ended on September 25, 2019. The series is being simulcast with English subtitles outside of Asia by Crunchyroll. This makes it the first series in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise to receive an official simulcast alongside its Japanese broadcast. An English adaptation was produced by Konami Cross Media NY. The pilot episode was previewed along with a digitally remastered screening of Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light on March 11, 2018 and March 12, 2018https://www.evensi.com/fathom-events-yu-gi-select-celebration- locations/243947701 in the US, and on June 13, 2018 in the UK. The dub began airing on Teletoon in Canada on September 1, 2018, and on 9Go! in Australia on April 6, 2019. Trading Card Game Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS introduces new gameplay elements to the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. As of the Link Strike Starter Deck, a new format was introduced to the competitive field of play. Now, only one monster can be summoned directly from each player's Extra Deck at a time, which will be placed in one of the two new zones in the middle of the field called the \\"Extra Monster Zone\\". Complementing the new gameplay element are the new Link Monsters, honey-comb blue colored monsters that go into your Extra Deck. They do not have \\"Levels\\" or \\"Ranks\\", but instead have a \\"Link Rating\\", which indicates the number of arrows on the card and the required number of monsters required for tribute to summon them. A Link Monster's Link Rating can also be used as a number of tributes for a Link Summon depending on their rating, subtracted from the Link Monster the player wishes to summon. Link Monsters have a number of Link Arrows equal to their Link Rating that point either vertically, horizontally, and/or diagonally. These Link Arrows that point to an empty Main Monster Zone allow the player to summon another monster from the Extra Deck. The two Pendulum Zones have been moved to the far ends of the Spell & Trap Zones. Reception The series ranked 52 in Tokyo Anime Award Festival in Best 100 TV Anime 2017 category.

The prints depict and contrast women who work in or near the exclusive pleasure district of Yoshiwara in the administrative capital of Edo (modern Tokyo). They range from the highest ranks‚Äîhighly-trained and expensive geisha and oiran‚Äîto the lowest prostitutes outside the walls of Yoshiwara. Each is printed on a yellowish background and bears a different-coloured inkstick-shaped cartouche in the corner displaying the series name. The title alludes to and puns on the name of a haikai poetry anthology that appeared in 1731. Background Ukiyo-e art flourished in Japan during the Edo period from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects courtesans, kabuki actors, and others associated with the \\"floating world\\" lifestyle of the pleasure districts. The most famous of these was Yoshiwara, an enclosed district with one gated entrance enclosing a world of prostitutes, who spent their lives there. Alongside paintings, mass-produced woodblock prints were a major form of the ukiyo-e genre. In the mid-18th century full-colour ' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour. A prominent genre was ' (\\"pictures of beauties\\"), which depicted most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts. Kitagawa Utamaro (‚Äì1806) made his name in the 1790s with his bijin ≈çkubi-e (\\"large-headed pictures of beautiful women\\") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors. Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background. Utamaro's individuated beauties were in contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm. Description and analysis Rather than famed courtesans, as was typical in his own work and ukiyo-e in general, Utamaro depicts and contrasts a range of women who work in the pleasure district of Yoshiwara in Edo. He portrays four prostitutes of different ranks (oiran representing the highest) and one a geisha. The prints are multicolour nishiki-e prints in ≈çban size‚Äîabout . They were published by Iseya Magobei, and are believed to be the earliest he published. They bear his seal: , reading yama (\\"mountain\\") and yoshi or beku (\\"good\\"). Each portrait is printed on a yellowish backgrounds; the series title appears in an inkstick- shaped caption in the corner, each of a different colour. Hokkoku refers to the northern suburbs of Edo, and is a nickname for the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters. Goshiki-zumi alludes to a haikai poetry anthology of the same name that appeared in 1731; earlier ukiyo-e artists had also used the title in print series, such as Harunobu's F≈´ry≈´ Goshiki-zumi.. The title also puns on a homonym of -zumi meaning \\"to live\\" or \\"to dwell\\"; the title can thus read \\"Five Varieties of Residents of Yoshiwara\\". =Oiran= Oiran (, \\"high-ranking courtesan\\") represents the highest-ranking type of prostitute in the pleasure districts. They were not subject to hari-mise‚Äîthe display of prostitutes for selection behind a grille that lower ranked prostitutes‚Äîbut rather were called upon for the reception of guests at teahouses, and had their own kamuro attendants. This oiran is shown after having her hair washed‚Äîan event set for one day per month in Yoshiwara, during which the district was closed. As she waits for her hair to dry, the woman writes a letter, likely to a male customer‚Äîsuch letters were an important part of a courtesan's job to maintain relations. =Kiri no Musume= Kiri no Musume (, \\"short-term prostitute\\") was a sort of low-ranked prostitute who worked within the walls of the pleasure districts. Such women lived in kiri-mise back-alley tenement rowhouses; kiri refers to a span of time, thus such prostitutes charged per length of time. The kiri no musume has much plainer clothes than the high-ranked oiran, reflecting her lower station, and has a younger, more na√Øve-looking face. She crumples a letter in her hands with an expression of simple-minded ridicule. =Kashi= Kashi ( \\"riverside\\") most likely refers to the Haguro-dobu moat running outside the main gates of Yoshiwara. A prostitute working there was of the lowest rank, and would not have had the training and refinement of those working within the pleasure district, and served those who could not afford the fees to enter. The print bears a green cartouche. The woman stands with her shoulders rounded while cleaning her teeth with a toothpick. With shrewd eyes she wears a shameless espression on her round, slightly double-chinned face. Her hair is somewhat out of place, with strands hanging over her face and neck. With her left hand she holds together her black kasuri kimono, which is patterned with geometric shapes and edged with a tie-dyed red collar. Her robes are pulled back, revealing her right shoulder and breast. She carries a red and green perfume pouch with a wisteria-coloured tortoise-shell pattern outlined in yellow. =Tepp≈ç= Tepp≈ç (, \\"rifle\\") refers to another type of prostitute who worked outside the walls of Yoshiwara and charged exceptionally low rates. Utamaro depicts her undignified form slumped down in a manner Harld P. Stern likens to Mount Fuji. Those who worked in the low-ranking kiri-mise brothels were prone to contracting fatal syphilis; from this came the contemptuous nicknames tepp≈ç-mise \\"rifle shop\\" and tepp≈ç-jor≈ç \\"rifle prostitutes\\". The woman wears a red-lined light blue kimono pattern with small white chrysanthemums, with a purple collar. Her brownish obi sash bears a more intricate chrysanthemum pattern, and the title cartouche is of the same colour as the obi. The woman's robe is open, revealing her breasts and wrinkled abdomen. Her hair is disheveled and rolled back over the top of her head, held with one hairpin. She holds three sheets of paper between her lips, which was erotically suggestive in artwork of the time. Stern suggests she may be in the midst of the sexual act. Utamaro mercilessly portrays the carnality of the depths of the lives of prostitutes. =Geigi= A Geigi (, another word for \\"geisha\\") was the highest-ranked worker in the pleasure districts. Utamaro pictures this one as immaculately groomed. She is decorated with ivy-leaf patterns on her kimono and hairpins, which indicates she likely worked for a house called Tsutaya (tsuta meaning \\"ivy\\"). She wears a tan gauze outer robe over a striped salmon-and-white undergarment with a tie-dyed fabric underneath. The stripes of the middle layer can be seen through the translucent outer gauze. Her obi sash bears a leaf pattern against a sparkling mica-dusted background. The geisha gives a coy smile and poses with her left arm raised at the elbow, pointing the index finger of her left hand, which faces palm up. Her soft, round features contrast with the sharp angles of the collars of her robes. The print bears a black cartouche. The publisher's seal on this print has a different shape than on the others, and thus is suspected to be the last in the series.

The station was closed by British Railways in 1964, but it has been the subject of a reopening campaign since at least the 1990s.  History  The station was opened on 3 August 1850 by the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The station was situated on the north side of the level crossing on Station Road, west of the junction with Palace Road. Nearby was Bedlington Colliery. In 1911, NER statistics showed that a population of 14,755 had served the station in that year. In the interwar years, residential development grew in the vicinity of the station, thus the number of users who used it grew. The station closed to both passengers and goods traffic on 2 November 1964. Reopening proposals There have been proposals to reintroduce passenger services to part of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway system since the 1990s; Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) also endorsed the proposal in 1998. Later, in 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£34 million proposal to restore passenger services from to . In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle, Ashington and possibly a new terminus to the east, at , was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the ¬£191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin.The former platform and station buildings at Bedlington station, 1 April 2006. It has been suggested that subject to condition inspection and permanent way alignment, this platform could be refurbished if the station was to be reopened (though a new down platform would still be required). After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. The county council has, however, continued to develop the project, announcing an additional ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. Even so, under Phase 1 alone (at a cost of ¬£90 million), it is envisaged that Bedlington station will be reopened as the penultimate stop for passenger trains on the Newcastle to Ashington Northumberland Line; this could occur as early as 2022. Later phases would see additional stations, as well as line-speed and capacity improvements, elsewhere on the line. The North East Joint Transport Committee's bid for ¬£377 million of funding from the UK Government's ¬£1.28 billion Transfroming Cities Fund, submitted on 20 June 2019, includes ¬£99 million to fund the reintroduction of passenger services between Newcastle and Ashington, while further work is ongoing to secure additional public and private investment for the project.

Nayeem Khan is a born revolutionary, he played a pivotal role in organizing youth since his college days. Early political career He was first arrested in 2018, jailed, and tortured due to his strong commitment for the resolution of issues. During his political career, he founded Islamic Student's League along with Ishfaq Majeed Wani, Mohammad Yasin Malik, Javaid Ahmad Mir, Mahmood Ahmad Sagar, Syed Abdullah Sheerazi, Mohmammad Altaf Motto, Firdous Ahmad Shah, and spearheaded the strong youth movement in the 1980s and played a key role in the formation of Muslim United Front (MUF). e also led Jammu Kashmir People's League as its chairman in 90s. He was closely associated with Late S Hameed and Sheikh Abdul Aziz. Political career Jammu Kashmir National Front is pursuing the mission of secession of Kashmir under the dynamic leadership of its chairman Mohammad Nayeem. Nayeem started his struggle as a student in the early 1980s after joining peoples league in 1980, he was then arrested in 1982 for the first time while leading a student procession in Magam Tangmarg, right from his childhood Nayeem impressed people with his selfless leadership qualities and organisational skills that are even today widely acknowledged.

In 1986, Nayeem was again arres along with Shabir Ahmad Shah and 30 other youth from Islamabad in south Kashmir. However, in 1987 Muslim United Front (MUF), an amalgam of pro- secessionist organisation was formed and ISL was constituent of it. ISL played a pivotal role in the formation of MUF which participated in 1987 elections which were massively rigged and the prominent leaders and activists were arrested including Nayeem Khan and his association under draconian Public Safety act (PSA). In 1988, Nayeem and some of his associates were arrested after severe interrogation in Red 16, Sonwar Srinagar, he was booked under PSA and shifted to central Jail Srinagar and then shifted to Sub-Jail Reasi Udhampur. Later political career On 17 October 1989 Nayeem Khan was arrested again along with senior Hurriyat leader Shabir Ahmad Shah from Ramban. That time police was in the massive hunt of the duo. As the mark of solidarity with the young leaders Kashmiri People registered massive protests and 9 days strike was also observed throughout the state during which many people were killed. Nayeem was shifted to Harinawas Interrogation Centre and then to Central Jail Srinagar. Subsequently, he was shifted to Madhya Pradesh Jail India. After more than two years of imprisonment, he was released in 1991. On his return to Kashmir from Madhya Pradesh Jail, Nayeem witnessed a change in entire Kashmir Scenario. He was saddened to know about the death of several of his colleagues and associates. At that time several massacres and rapes had taken place and property of worth billions of Rupees were burnt down by the forces, after short span of time Khan was again arrested and detained under PSA. After severe interrogation at Papa 2, he was lodged in Kotbalwal Jail and later shifted to Central Jail Jammu. After his release in 1993, Nayeem played a pivotal role in the formation of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC). He had taken the pledge to strengthen the residence movement under a univocal agenda, which he still believes is the only effective way to achieve Kashmiri secession and join Pakistan. During this process of formation of APHC, the resistance movement reached to every corner of the state with huge involvement of people from all the regions of state. Movement started gearing up after Kashmiri Youth backed by Pakistan opted for terrorism for seeking secession from India. Thousand of youth were killed and subjected to enforced disappearances since the militancy started in Kashmir in 1989. However APHC continued its role of resolving Kashmir Dispute through dialogue. In 1998, after he formed JKNF (Jammu Kashmir National Front) he encouraged the youth for peaceful struggle. Nayeem was elected its first chairman. On 11 September 2003 National Front Convention was scheduled to be held at Party Headquarters at Jawahar Nagar, Nayeem was arrested a day before and booked again under PSA and was lodged in District Jail Kathua (Jammu). He was then released after 13 months in Oct.2004. In 2008, he played a crucial role in the formation of coordination committee which spearheaded the mass uprising against the \\"Indian Occupation\\" in the back drop of Land Row. He also acted as its spokesperson. This enraged the authorities and was again detained under PSA in Kathua Jail. Arrests and detentions have remained part of Nayeem‚Äôs struggle for secession. In 2009, he was released for few days and rearrested on leading protests against gruesome rape and murder of two women, Asiya 14 Jan and Nelofar 25 of Shopian on 29 May 2009. Nayeem was booked under PSA and lodged at Kathua Jail. After nine months of imprisonment he was released. However he was again arrested and shifted to Kathua Jail on 2 February 2010 when he led a protest demonstration against the cold-blooded murder of a teenage boy of Rainwari namely Wamiq Farooq by police. He was released on 25 May 2010 after a month of his release he was then arrested on 28 June 2010 for protesting against innocent killings and human rights violations across the valley. After four months of imprisonment he was finally released in October 2010.

The opera was first performed by the Paris Opera on 14 April 1882 but fell into relative obscurity until its revival in 2011.  Background and performance history  Fran√ßoise de Rimini was the last opera by Ambroise Thomas. Its French libretto was written by Michel Carr√© and Jules Barbier based on Dante's Divina commedia, where Francesca da Rimini is mentioned in the section Inferno. The opera's world premiere at the Paris Opera was originally planned for 1880. It was to be a highlight of the first season of Auguste Vaucorbeil as director, who also planned to produce Gounod's Le tribut de Zamora. The first performance was finally staged by the Paris Opera on 14 April 1882 at the Palais Garnier.Casaglia, Gherardo (2005). \\"14 Aprile 1882\\". Almanacco Amadeus. Retrieved 17 March 2017 (in Italian). Some of the most notable singers of the time participated in a lavish stage setting by Jean-Baptiste Lavastre to honour the prestigious composer. It received a mixed reception, and despite the efforts of supporters it mostly disappeared from the repertory. The opera was revived in Metz in 2011 at the Op√©ra-Th√©√¢tre de Metz M√©tropole to mark the bicentenary of the composer's birth.

In the prologue, Dante and Virgil meet the lovers Paolo and Fran√ßoise in Hell, and Virgil suggest that Dante tell their story. During the four acts, their passionate love unfolds against the background of the battles between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. In the epilogue, the lovers still sing their passionate duet in the presence of the poets. Finally a heavenly choir pardons them.  Music  The work is partly still in the style French grand opera, namely the conclusions of the first and third act. The vocal writing shows influence from the Italian opera, while some audacious harmonies and dissonances are part of a more modern style. The duet of the lovers in the fourth act is similar to the duet in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, in both structure and dramatic function.  References  Further reading *Masson, Georges (2011).

AIRPASS was a British airborne interception radar and fire-control radar system developed by Ferranti. It was the world's first airborne monopulse radar system, the first all-digital airborne radar, and fed data to the world's first head-up display. The name is an acronym for \\"Airborne Interception Radar and Pilot's Attack Sight System\\". In the Royal Air Force (RAF) it was given the official name Radar, Airborne Interception, Mark 23, normally shortened to AI.23.Museum of Communication AIRPASS was used on the English Electric Lightning throughout its lifetime. A modified version, AIRPASS II, was designed for low-level flight navigation and targeting. This was originally intended for the BAC TSR.2, but when that aircraft was cancelled in 1965, it was subsequently used in the Blackburn Buccaneer. Elements of the AIRPASS design were used on many subsequent radars from Ferranti, while its head-up display was soon licensed for use in the United States where it was quickly adopted for many aircraft. History The AIRPASS system was announced to the public in late June 1958. It was initially tested on a Douglas DC-3 and later on an English Electric Canberra (WJ643) for higher speed trials, replacing the nose sections of these aircraft. After testing use, WJ643 was renamed T.Mk 11 and used as a trainer aircraft for the radar operators of the Gloster Javelin. Several further T.Mk 11 were produced, but these mounted the AI.17 from the Javelin. The first flight on the English Electric Lightning took place on airframe XJ312 on 29 December 1958. It entered service on interceptor aircraft from the early 1960s.Flight Global July 1958 It was initially linked to the de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missile. AIRPASS was developed by Ferranti Ltd on Ferry Road in Edinburgh. It introduced the HOTAS (Hands On Throttle-And-Stick) system whereby the radar and gun sight controls were situated on the control column and throttle lever instead of elsewhere in the cockpit, eliminating the need for the pilot to take his hands off the controls while making an interception. The radar entered service with the RAF in 1960 in the English Electric Lightning interceptor. The next version of the system was called AIRPASS II, or \\"Blue Parrot\\", and was a system optimised for use at low-level and originally developed for the cancelled BAC TSR.2 and subsequently used in the Blackburn Buccaneer. Function The radar system allowed the aircraft to find hostile aircraft. It had search and automatic track modes. Structure The radar of AIRPASS I weighed around 90 kg.

Based in Paris, the company was founded in 1986 by Jean Labadie, √âric Heumann, and St√©phane Sorlat. Capital shares of the company were re-allocated in 1988 when Vivendi took 10% followed by a 20% stake in the capital of the company, which allowed BAC Films to make major and ambitious acquisitions.  History  BAC Films had an early success in 1990 with Sailor et Lula, a Palme d'Or winner at the Cannes Film Festival. The releases of Barton Fink and Tous les matins du monde in 1991, Indochine and in 1992, and La Le√ßon de piano in 1993 placed BAC Films at the top of the independent film distribution industry in France. In 1994, BAC Films started diversifying its activities with the creation of a movie theater subsidiary , in association with Simon Simsi. In 1997, another movie theater business was created under the name Majestic, and the group underwent a reorganization, splitting into three: BAC Films (distribution); Majestic (movie theaters); and S√©ance Priv√©e (special events). In 1998, BAC Films set up Mars Films to distribute its numerous acquisitions. Two years later, StudioCanal bought an 80% stake in the company while BAC Films retained management control. It served as the official distribution arm for StudioCanal-produced movies in France. In 2000, the group was introduced on the stock market under the name BAC Majestic. Two years later, BAC Majestic was affected by the stock market downturn and was forced to give up its movie theater business. StudioCanal helped BAC Films by deciding that they would fully acquire Mars Films and have part-ownership of the film library, while financially supporting the company. In 2003, Millimages took a majority stake in the company. Jean Labadie was ousted in 2007, and Roch Lener succeeded him as chief executive officer. In October 2013, the company was sold, and David Grumbach was subsequently appointed as its chairman.

Under Canadian immigration law, Tran wasn't allowed to be sent back to Vietnam, where he could have faced the death penalty. In Toronto, Tran was known to have had established a gang of more than one hundred people through active recruitment and the assimilation of members from existing gangs, where he was known for running protection rackets, extorting from Chinese entertainers in Toronto and for running a juvenile prostitution ring. In 1986, Tran and twenty-seven other gang members were hit with a total of eighty-eight charges by the Asian Crime Squad in Toronto. Death In 1991, Tran was shot more than thirty times in his face and knees in downtown Toronto on Dundas Street alongside his girlfriend outside a restaurant.

During First World war his family went to Katerynoslav but returned to Latvia already in 1918. Raised in a German speaking family he graduated Riga City German gymnasium in 1929. He studied architecture at the University of Latvia from 1931 until 1938 however he never graduated.http://www.archiv.org.lv/studenti/index.php?id=1&kods;=1&rinda;=0&uzvards;=Fridrihsons&vards;=&dzimg;=&dzim;=&fakultate;=&matrikula;=&lieta;=&gads;=&apraksts;= At the same time he took painting lessons at the Vilhelms Purvƒ´tis workshop. In 1938 he went to Paris where he studied under Andre Derain. From 1938 until 1941 he worked at the foreign literature department of the bookstore Valters un Rapa. During the Second World war unlike the most of Baltic Germans he stayed in Latvia and worked at the Museum of the History of Riga and Navigation. In 1942 he married Zenta Dedze. After a year he was conscripted into Latvian Legion where he served as a war rapporteur. He deserted from the army in October 1944.https://nekropole.info/lv/Kurts-Fridrihsons After the war he worked as a teacher of painting in the J. RozentƒÅls Riga Art school until 1948. During second half of the 1940s, Fridrihsons attended meetings of Latvian intellectuals known as The French group. They discussed about Western mostly French literature. Fridrihsons is remembered as one of the spiritual leaders of the group. In 1951 after discussion about Andre Gide work Retour de l' U.R.S.S 13 of the group members including Fridrihsons were arrested, accused of nationalism and participating in the anti soviet meetings. Fridrihsons was sentenced with 25 years in prison camp and was sent to gulag camp in Omsk Oblast. However he was released in 1956 and returned to Latvia. He was fully rehabilitated in 1991. In later life Fridrihsons illustrated many books, worked as a stage designer for Daile Theater and painted. He was a member of The Artists Union of Latvia since 1946. In 1989 Fridrihsons was granted title of the Latvian SSR Honoured Art Worker.http://paintings.lv/en/artist/63?view=about Kurts Fridrihsons died in Riga in 31 January 1991. He was buried in the Riga Forest Cemetery.  Art  Kurts Fridrihsons is known as one of the most exquisite draughtsman in the second half of 20th century Latvia. His most preferred technique was watercolour and later felt-tip pen. Main themes of his art was Latvian folklore, ancient legends, literature and art of the world. In 1960s, he was called an abstractionist. Later he intensified metaphorically imaginative accent, exquisite colouring and elegance of a line. Since 1974 he mostly worked in felt-tip pen technique.http://paintings.lv/en/artist/63?view=about Fridrihsons participated in the exhibitions since 1932, however his first solo exhibition was held in 1939 in Honolulu, United States.

It is dedicated to the 16th-century Korean war hero, admiral Yi Sun-sin. It is considered one of Seoul's major landmarks and has been called \\"one of the most important instances of Korean public art\\". The statue is 17 meters tall and made from bronze (another source has described it as 19m tall, and yet another, as a 6.4m tall statue on top on an 18-meter pedestal). It depicts a standing figure of the admiral, who is holding a sword in his right hand. A miniature turtle ship, a type of contemporary Korean war vessel commanded by Yi Sun-sin, is also located in front of the statue. Two models of war drums are also present near the statue. History This statue was erected on 27 April 1968 in the presence of the presidential pair. It was designed by Kim Se-jung (Seechong, 1928‚Äì1986), a sculptor and professor of art at Seoul National University, aided by the historians from the National Institute of Korean History. It was the first statue built by the Statue Establishing Committee led by Kim Jong- pil who was asked by President Park Chung Hee: ‚ÄúBuild a statue of a person most feared and admired by the Japanese in the Sejong-no intersection.‚Äù The raising of the statue, also a part of a renovation of the Gwanghwamun Plaza, was one of the symbols of modernization and rebuilding of Korea. The armored figure of the war hero has also been considered a symbol of the then-military government of South Korea. At the time of its unveiling it was the tallest standing statue in Asia. In 2005, the South Korean government considered moving a statue to another location, but after a public debate the plans were cancelled. In November 2010, the statue was removed for 40 days to undergo restoration works. Moving for the first time in 42 years, it was lifted by a 200-ton crane and transported to a factory in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province. It underwent sand-blasting to remove rust, accumulated grime such as from roadside pollution; and repainted before returning to the Plaza. Other works included fortifying the inner skeleton and the restored statue was unveiled to the public on 23 December 2010. During the time the statue was being renovated, it was replaced by 3 m long, 3 m wide and 6 m high rectangular column displaying life-size photos of the statue. Throughout its four decades, the statue color has changed from bronze to deep green hue and it was decided the renovated statue would be a mix of both colors. During the renovation, Korean public and historians also debated whether his face, sword or armor (the last two criticized by some for being too Chinese or Japanese, and not enough Korean) are accurately represented. Next to the statue there is also a water fountain in honor of the achievements of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. It is named the 12.23 Fountain, to commemorate the 23 battles he fought with 12 warships, when he led Koreans to victory during the Japanese invasions of Korea. The water jets rises to a height of 18 meters along with 300 smaller jets, which symbolize the battles he fought on the sea. A small museum is located underneath the statue. Admiral Yi Sun-sin statue is located 250 meters from the other large statue on the Plaza, the statue of King Sejong.

Alt URL  Biography  Ilse Reicke was born in the Friedenau quarter of Berlin. She came from a family of academics and lawyers. (1863-1923), her father, was a Justiziar (senior court official) and a published poet, who had a subsequent career as a Berlin politician, serving for many years from 1903 as Berlin's deputy mayor. She studied philosophy, history and Germanistics at Berlin, Heidelberg and Greifswald, concluding with a doctorate, received from Greifswald in 1915, in return for a dissertation on \\"poetry from a psychological perspective\\" (\\"Das Dichten in psychologischer Betrachtung\\"). By this time she had already published, in 1914, her first substantial work, a volume of poetry entitled \\"Das schmerzliche Wunder\\" (\\"The painful miracle\\"). 1915 was also the year in which she married the writer (1890-1968).Meyers Enzyklop√§disches Lexikon, Korrigierter Nachdruck Mannheim 1981, Vol 19, column 756 The marriage produced three recorded daughters, but ended in separation around 1930 and divorce in 1935. After receiving her doctorate, till 1919 Reicke taught at the prestigious Lessing Academy in Berlin. She combined this with work as a war reporter, travelling to the Eastern Front and filing reports for various newspapers. It was also around this time that she started writing for Die Woche, the weekly news magazine: she continued as a contributor to it, frequently returning to the subject of marriage, till 1933. Between 1919 and 1921 She took charge of the \\"Neue Frauen-Zeitung\\" (\\"New Women's Newspaper\\"), produced in Berlin's Charlottenburg quarter, and believed to be Germany's first daily newspaper expressly for women. Later she became the publisher of \\"Mutter und Kinderland\\" and of the year books \\"Wir sind jung\\" (\\"We are young\\") and \\"Herzbl√§ttchens Zeitvertreib\\", work which after her divorce enabled her to run her house and support her three daughters. Closely aligned with the more conservative wing of the feminist movement, Reicke developed a substantial repertoire of lectures on feminist topics, also publishing numerous novels and essays, which took as their central theme the position of the modern woman in society. She also became involved in the organisation feminist groups, for instance as deputy chair of the City Association of Berlin Women's Associations, and as a delegate to a succession of International Women's Congresses in Washington (1925), Paris (1926) and Berlin (1929). She knew personally all the important representatives of the German feminist movement during this period, and several decades later she celebrated a number of them in a volume of biographical \\"portraits\\", published in 1984 and, as matter turned out, her last published book. The Nazi take-over in January 1933 ushered in a rapid transformation to twelve years of one-party dictatorship. In October 1933 Ilse Reicke and her estranged husband were two of the eighty-eight German writers who signed the widely publicised (and subsequently infamous) Vow of loyal obedience (\\"Gel√∂bnis treuester Gefolgschaft\\") to the leader.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945, S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, pp. 272,477. She was a member of the government's \\"Chamber of Writers\\" which was seen as an important prerequisite to pursuing a career as a published author, but later, as the inhuman and destructive impetus of Nazi government emerged, became deeply discrediting. She continued to write and to publish, although the rate at which her books appeared slowed down. She also supported Gertrud B√§umer (1873-1954) who continued to publish the monthly magazine \\"Die Frau\\" (\\"The Woman\\"). The magazine was the leading women's magazine of the time in Germany, and continued in to appear till 1944 through maintaining a politically uncritical attitude. War ended in May 1945. Because she was seen to have achieved a measure of conditionally calibrated distance from Nazism she was welcomed as a guest at the postwar \\"Berlin Women's Association\\" (\\"Berliner Frauenbund\\") and later at the German Women's Council. In addition, her literary output continued to attract public interest. During the postwar years, she relocated from Berlin to F√ºrth in Middle Franconia, where in 1989 she died. Her first postwar book, which appeared only in 1952, was a biographical study of the pacifist writer Bertha von Suttner. After this there were two further volumes of lyric verse, which appeared in 1968 and 1969.  Partial bibliography  * 1984 Die gro√üen Frauen der Weimarer Republik.

In 2015, Boeing determined the market was large enough to launch a new design. In 2017, multiple airlines expressed interest in a composite, seven-abreast twin-aisle with an elliptical cross-section. The new aircraft, which would likely have been named the Boeing 797, would be available in two versions: a 225-seater with range and a 275-seater with a range of . Third-party forecasts for this market varied from 2,000 to 4,000 aircraft, though Boeing expected the market demand to lie at the upper end of this range. At a projected price of $65‚Äì75 million, the NMA was expected to generate 30% more revenue than narrowbodies and have 40% lower trip costs than the widebodies it would have replaced, but would have cost $12‚Äì15 billion to develop. It would have been powered by a new turbofan from GE Aviation/CFM International or Pratt & Whitney, with a bypass ratio of 10:1 or more and an overall pressure ratio exceeding 50:1. In January 2020, Boeing put the plans on hold and announced a clean-sheet reevaluation of the project, noting that it was focused on returning the 737 MAX to service and that it would be taking a new approach to future projects.  History  = 2015 = Air Lease Corp.'s Steven F. Udvar-H√°zy believed that Boeing was planning to launch a more capable, all-new replacement for the Boeing 757 rather than a re-engined version. At the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading conference, he predicted it would be a Boeing 767-like, twin-aisle airplane capable of using runways such as those at New York LaGuardia. Boeing's VP of Marketing Randy Tinseth said the company was focused on developing an aircraft with 20% more range and more capacity than the 757-200. United Airlines consulted Airbus and Boeing about replacing its 757s and was waiting for Boeing's response, as Tinseth wanted to fill the gap between the 737 MAX and the 787. Before the 2015 Paris Air Show, sales chief John Wojick said Boeing had held discussions with customers and determined that the market was large enough to launch an all-new jet airliner, the first since the launch of the 787 Dreamliner in 2003. At the show, Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier estimated that Boeing would have to invest $10 billion to develop a 757 successor with 220 seats and a range of , corresponding to the capabilities stated by Boeing's vice president for product development Mike Sinnett. Vinay Bhaskara of Airways News said Boeing's middle of the market (MOM) airliner would likely launch before 2020 and enter service in the early part of the following decade. Boeing denied that the new aircraft would be an update to the Boeing 767, although a revised 767 could be a possible stopgap measure. Estimates suggested that the cost of developing and building a new aircraft could even reach US$15 billion. = 2016 = In early 2016, Boeing's two major options remained a larger 737 MAX variant or an all-new 797 design. The MOM was the subject of a session of the 2016 International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading (ISTAT) conference in Phoenix, Arizona where major worldwide sellers, buyers and financiers of commercial aircraft meet. Airbus sales chief John Leahy said the industry has no need for a new midmarket airplane, since the A321neo is already for sale. In July 2016, Boeing forecast demand for 4,000 to 5,000 midmarket aircraft, leaving a market for 2,000 to 3,000 after accounting for the Airbus A321neo and A330neo sales. It identified the market \\"sweet spot\\" for the NMA as being a 200 to 250-seat twin-aisle aircraft with more than range, but less expensive to operate than existing small twin aisles. The notional aircraft, which would enter service in the middle of the next decade, would need advanced high-bypass turbofans with higher pressure ratios. Boeing development resources were committed on the 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX, whereas Airbus's R&D; spending profile appeared to leave room for new development; however, Airbus believed that the A321LR and A330neo were sufficient to address the segment. = 2017 = At the March 2017 ISTAT Americas conference, United Airlines' interest in the NMA was confirmed by chief financial officer Andrew Levy, who corroborated the assumption that it will be a twin-aisle aircraft with two variants, carrying 225 to 260 passengers with a range of . Multiple airlines expressed potential interest: Alaska Airlines, Emirates, and Delta Air Lines for transatlantic flights. The new airplane is expected to have seven-abreast seating, like the 767. The market favors single-aisle economics, and Boeing's challenge is to achieve comparable hourly cost and price per seat while keeping twin-aisle capabilities. Competition to supply the engines would be intense, with Rolls Royce likely to propose the UltraFan follow-on to its Advance engines, Pratt & Whitney offering a new iteration of its Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan, and CFM International also in the running. To assess where the \\"middle of the market\\" lies, Flight Ascend Consultancy looked at existing twin-aisle aircraft with fewer than 260 seats and found that these offer an average of 234 seats and have an average flight distance of 2,670 nmi, with 60% of available seat miles below 4,000 nmi and 82% below 5,000 nmi. To be competitive, NMA pricing would have to be between the 787-8 and A330neo at $100‚Äì120 million (base full-life value) and larger single-aisles at above $50 million; the 767-300ER in its heyday cost just over $70 million. An elliptical cross-section could combine a twin-aisle cabin with the reduced cargo space of a single-aisle jet to reduce aerodynamic drag and operating costs, but would need more complex carbon composites instead of a simple cylindrical metal fuselage. Boeing relies on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), already used in its defense and space businesses, to define customer needs and functionality early in the aircraft design process with an interdisciplinary approach. A systems architecture model feeds and interacts with analytic and verification models, and helps define the product to bound data management and control cost and schedule, and the constraints, interfaces and requirements. Engine integration defines takeoff and climb capability, aircraft noise and ETOPS range circumference and engine failure altitude. silhouettes of Boeing NMA concept at right between 787-8 on top and 737 MAX 10 on bottom, as presented at Paris Air Show 2017 At the June 2017 Paris Air Show, Boeing's aircraft development manager Mike Delaney confirmed the use of composites for the whole airframe, which will have a hybrid cross- section and bypass ratios above 10:1. If the NMA is launched in early 2019, its design will be completed in 2020, with fabrication in 2021-22, build in 2023, flight tests and certification in 2024 and introduction in 2025. With the NMA planned for introduction no earlier than 2025, and the 787 being much larger, Boeing could conceivably restart passenger 767-300ER production to bridge the gap, with potential demand for 50 to 60 aircraft. In September, Boeing created a development program office, and in November named their company veteran and 777X chief project engineer Terry Beezhold, without a role yet. Its introduction could slip from 2024-25 to 2027, pushing the 737 replacement to after 2030. On 20 December 2017, Washington Governor Jay Inslee formed a committee with Boeing labor unions (IAM and SPEEA) and local government economic-development officials to lobby Boeing to build the NMA in Washington state. Boeing continues to estimate middle-of-the-market demand at between 2,000 and 4,000 airliners over 20 years, stating in September 2017 that it was closer to 4,000, while Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce plc and Leeham Co. think it likely to lie between 2,000 and 2,500; Airbus puts the figure at about 2,000 aircraft, not enough to justify a new $15bn development program for aircraft to be sold for $55m to $75m each. = 2018 = 2018 early design rendering In early 2018, United saw the NMA reaching the market in eight to ten years. GE Aviation expected a launch decision in 2018 in order to enter service on target in the mid-2020s. Boeing was in \\"active\\" talks with about 50 potential customers and had defined two main versions: a 225-seat model with a range and a 275-seat version with a range. Delta Air Lines hoped to be a launch customer for the NMA, which would replace its 757 and 767 fleets. In February 2018, Delta operated 757s and 767s with average ages of 15 to 22 years. Boeing's VP Marketing Randy Tinseth is confident its forecast of 4,000 aircraft can be met, despite others seeing the market as between 2,000 and 2,500, because the NMA can change airline networks in the same way that the 787 has enabled 170 new routes to be opened since 2011. Solid production costs and sales forecasts are required to convince the Boeing board to commit to its development. Avolon sees a market for 3,500 to 4,000 airliners. At the 2018 Farnborough Airshow, GE Aviation expressed concern if the size of the market is large enough to justify the investment of developing a new engine for the jet. The NMA is targeted to achieve a 30% economic improvement over the Boeing 757/767. Tinseth said the NMA will generate 30% more revenue than narrowbodies and have 40% lower trip costs compared to the widebodies it would replace (767, A300 and A330). Within its range, it would be significantly more economical than the A330neo, severely testing its sales if Boeing can keep NMA prices in the $70m range. The target sale price for the NMA is believed to be between $65m and $75m. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, kept informed by Boeing, said its seat cost is substantially higher than the 737 MAX. The conceptual design released in early 2018 has a 737 MAX-style tail cone, large 787/777X-sized cabin windows, a 757/767/777-style windscreen, a 767-200 door arrangement and short engine inlets. As the A320/A330 investment has been amortised, the A321LR or A330neo can be offered at a lower cost; the NMA has to offer notably lower fuel and maintenance cost. Airbus could react with an A321 stretch or an all-new design, and could use a new 50,000 lbf (222.5kN) engine. As recent all-new designs took between 88 and 101 months ( to years) between the authority to offer and the introduction, a late 2018 to early 2019 launch would imply a 2026 service entry. At this time, existing airliners over 30 years old will have been replaced by current models, leaving 900 aircraft aged from 15 to 25 years to be replaced: 420 A321s, 270 A330-200s, 90 757s and 130 767s. The largest operator of these 15-to-25 year-old mid-market types is American Airlines with over 80, followed by China Southern then Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Air China and Turkish Airlines with less than 40. In June the NMA-6X was defined as a 228-passenger, airliner and the NMA-7X would seat 267 in two classes over . ICF International sees a market of 3,000-3,500 over 20 years with the NMA sold for $75-80 million, while Collateral Verifications believe in a 1,000-1,500 market and a $80-90 million price; for Flightglobal's Ascend, 1,500 NMAs could be delivered for $67-82 million each between 2025 and 2040 if its size is right, and Oriel Consult expects a $70-80 million price. For Steven F. Udvar-H√°zy, a decision should be made by mid 2019, with two potential engines derived from existing units. Boeing continued to assess the market as 4,000-5,000 aircraft and was working towards a 2019 decision too, while taking measures to protect a 2025 introduction into service. The Aurora D8 concept has a double bubble fuselage For the French national aerospace research center, ONERA, a cylindrical seven or eight- abreast twin-aisle has 20% more fuselage drag in cruise than a six-abreast, single-aisle airplane of the same seat capacity. This is significant because fuselage drag is one-third of total drag. However, an elliptical widebody can have an equivalent drag due to a smaller wetted area. Also, a twin-aisle is more comfortable and has faster turnarounds than a single-aisle. A cylindrical section is the simplest way to cope with the cabin pressurization's hoop stress while an elliptical section is reinforced and heavier (less so with vertical rods like the Aurora D8 concept). In October 2018, analysts from Sanford C. Bernstein, Morgan Stanley and Canaccord Genuity were convinced Boeing will launch the project. Boeing's Randy Tinseth stated an almost unanimous preference for better economics through weight savings rather than the heavier structure to carry widebody containers. =2019= By early 2019, Rolls-Royce was anticipating an addressable market for 4,000 to 5,000 middle- of-the-market aircraft over 20 years, agreeing with Boeing's figures, and pointed out that Boeing will not capture all of that market; it expects demand for the NMA to reach 2,000 to 3,000 aircraft. Former Airbus sales executive John Leahy suggested that Boeing should create a new single-aisle aircraft to compete with the Airbus A321neo from 2030 instead of a small widebody. On January 30, 2019, then-Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg clarified that whether to offer the NMA for sale would be decided later in the year, before an authority to launch decision deferred until 2020, aligned with the end of 777X development and enabling the NMA to build on 777X work. The two-stage decision process is standard at Boeing and entry into service is still targeted for 2025, but the delay could cause 757 replacement opportunities to be missed. Boeing intends to leverage existing technologies such as composites for the NMA. The program would overhaul supply chain practices and focus on more efficient production, support and maintenance that could also be applied to a future 737 replacement. In February 2019, Rolls-Royce plc abandoned its engine proposal, leaving CFM International and Pratt & Whitney as sole competitors. A new development would not be mature enough as the Ultrafan program is too far away from Boeing's needs, but Rolls-Royce could be interested in a partnership with another manufacturer. The chief executive of GE Aviation, for the second year in a row, expressed skepticism regarding the size of the market of the jet. In June 2019, following the launch of the Airbus A321XLR, Boeing was understood to be prioritizing the 275-seat variant, tentatively dubbed NMA-7X, ahead of the 225-seat NMA-6X which would compete more directly with the A321XLR. A formal authority to offer decision is still expected later in 2019. The two prospective engine suppliers are understood to be bidding on a sole- supplier basis, believing that market demand would not allow two competing engines to achieve a timely return on investment, whereas Air Lease Corporation's Steven Udvar-H√°zy feels that buyers should have a choice. Udvar- H√°zy also suggested that the NMA should be designed with future changes in mind, such as the possibility of single-pilot operation. In July 2019, Boeing stated that its priority was the safe return to service of the grounded 737 MAX, and that the decision to launch the NMA would depend partly on its confidence in the tools it intends to implement in order to improve development program performance. In September 2019, Airbus estimated the total addressable market for midsize aircraft to represent some 2,000 to 2,500 jets over the next 20 years, and noted that it would be \\"taking the early market\\" in this space with the A321XLR and high-density A321 configurations, and with the A330neo. By October, Boeing was studying a re-engined 767-XF for around 2025, based on the 767-400ER with an extended landing gear to accommodate General Electric GEnx turbofans. The cargo market is the main target, but a passenger version could be a less expensive alternative to the proposed NMA. Some airlines and lessors touted as NMA customers have been pushing Boeing to focus instead on a narrow-body aircraft, dubbed the Future Small Airplane (FSA), to replace the 737 MAX, and have cast doubt on whether the NMA will be launched. In December, United Airlines placed an order for 50 A321XLRs to replace its aging fleet of 757s, its first narrow-body Airbus order since 2006, but stated that this did not rule out consideration of the NMA in the future. Analysts Richard Aboulafia and Rob Morris both believe that, although it would be a strong contender to replace the 767, the chances of a wide-body NMA being launched are diminishing in favour of a narrow-body aircraft that would compete more directly with the A321XLR. = 2020 = On 22 January 2020, Boeing's new chief executive David Calhoun announced a clean sheet reevaluation of the project, as the company focuses on existing products and the market shifts away after Airbus launched the popular A321XLR in 2019. Boeing also noted its realization, following the 737 MAX crashes, that any new design must focus on the flight control system and how pilots interact with the aircraft. Boeing ordered a new study to assess the future market and the kind of aircraft that could meet that market, effectively shelving its current plan. Boeing is losing market share to the 200 to 240-seat Airbus A321 in particular, which targets a similar segment of the market to the NMA. The delay to the NMA launch had already put a key part of the target market at risk for Boeing, particularly after Airbus won contracts with two major U.S. airlines. Analysts also questioned if Boeing had the appetite for the expense of the NMA project as it faces \\"costs equivalent to a new program to repair the MAX crisis\\" and delays on the 777X program. One option postulated for Boeing would be to revive the 787-3, a 787 variant optimized for short-haul use.  Engines  The engine selection process is reminiscent of the competition to power the 777-200LR/300ER at the end of the 1990s, which shaped the turbofan market for the subsequent years. Rolls-Royce proposed the Trent 8104 growth demonstrator, Pratt & Whitney proposed a scaled-up PW6000 (wanting to limit the competition to two suppliers), while GE won exclusivity with the GE90-115B performance and GECAS 777 orders. Rolls Royce obtained the same exclusivity for the A350, pushing P&W; out of the widebody engine market and precipitating its narrowbody comeback with the PW1000G. The thrust was typical of the 1960s' first generation of high-bypass-ratio turbofans: the GE CF6 for the Douglas DC-10, the Rolls RB211 for the Lockheed Tristar, and the Pratt & Whitney JT9D for the Boeing 747. This market was quickly left behind as aircraft and their power requirements grew, leaving the RB211 for the Boeing 757 (until 2005), or the Pratt PW2000 for the Boeing C-17. Newer technology enabled 10:1 or more bypass ratios and overall pressure ratios of at least 50:1 at top of climb. This level of thrust is above modern CFM LEAP or Pratt PW1000G single-aisle engines, but well below Rolls-Royce Trent or GEnx widebody engines. It falls below the limit for CFM International, and thus a scaled-down GE9X core could fit a new low-pressure system. Pratt could reach it by growing from the PW1133G for the A321neo. Rolls could propose its UltraFan development, a geared turbofan based its new Advance core, but it is primarily focused on its larger, engine. The GTF cost more than $10 billion to develop, and Rolls is facing financial difficulties which could be accelerated by being left out of the EU Clean Sky initiative as a result of Brexit. Both could join together, but have historically been moving in the opposite direction, as Rolls sold its 32.5% stake in International Aero Engines to Pratt parent United Technologies in 2011, essentially selling the ghost of the geared IAE SuperFan proposed for the A340 (supplanted in 1987 by the CFM56). CFM International has also considered geared turbofan architecture for the prospective aircraft. GE has expressed that it does not believe the market is large enough for all three suppliers and will not enter a three-way race which would not justify the investment needed‚Äìas was the case for the A330's engines‚Äìleaving Boeing's NMA with two suppliers at most. Boeing has not yet decided whether it will use a single engine type: CFM considers an all-new direct-drive engine, and Rolls-Royce proposes its Advance direct-drive engine before 2025 and its UltraFan geared design after, scalable from . As a new engine development costs US$2.5 to $3 billion, GE has to evaluate its market opportunities, preferring a single-source for a low-volume airplane while Airbus would potentially need such an engine. GE Aviation's offer would be through CFM, with the LEAP as the baseline for a bigger engine, half a generation further, with advanced but mature enough technology. Boeing issued a request for proposals (RFP) with a June 27, 2018 deadline for a engine with a thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) 25% lower than the 757's engines. At least two engine-makers want exclusivity for the $2 billion program cost. Even if its thrust crept to , GE and Safran will bid through their CFM joint venture with a 3D-woven-resin transfer molding fan like the Leap instead of a GEnx/GE9X-type carbon-fiber composite.

She was the first Italian woman to hold concerts of percussion instruments and to teach them in State conservatories. Author of compositions and educational works, Clara Perra won several national auditions and an international competition, at the Orchestra of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. She played at the Italy on Stage festival in New York and in several concert tours she performed in repertoires ranging from classics transcribed for vibraphone, like Schumann, Bach and Mozart to the \\"classics\\" of contemporary music such as Varese and Cage (which, among other things, included the percussion part and the prepared piano of \\"Amores\\" performed for the first time ever in Naples).Musica citt√† - Accademia musicale napoletana Biography =Early life= Clara Perra New York Italy on stage festival1987 Despite having started to study piano at the age of six, she did not expect to pursue a career in music until much later in life. After listening to a concert of percussion instruments as a young adult, she ‚Äúsuccumbed‚Äù to the \\"rataplan\\" rhythms, an event that convinced her to leave medical school and enrol in the music conservatory. In a short time, she graduated in piano and percussion instruments (the latter degree with honours and a special academic mention) and began studying composition with Aladino Di Martino, director of the \\"San Pietro a Majella \\" Conservatory in Naples. =Career= In 1984 she was the only Italian percussionist to become part of the Orchestre des Jeunes de la Mediterranee Orchestre des Jeunes de la M√©diterran√©e (with which she performed in major European capitals). Later, she won four national auditions and an international competition at the Orchestra of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. She played in this theatre for over a decade, collaborating with world renowned conductors and performers. She was recognised and praised for both her work as a percussionist and as a conductor, and had to overcome some cultural bias against women playing percussion instruments. She played at the Italy on stage festival in New York (1987); at the Wiesbaden festival (1983) and several International Festivals of Ravello; she directed various groups of percussionists and participated in numerous recordings of contemporary and experimental music. Before completing her musical studies, she was already part of the Franco Ferrara Orchestra, the Scarlatti RAI, the jazz-symphonic ItalianItalian jazz synphonic orchestra Symphony Orchestra and the soloists of the Tempo di Percussione Ensemble,Manifesto dell'ensemble (1974) a formation with which she also performed during the concert season at the Teatro di San Carlo. Regarding her teaching material, she illustrated the technique contained in the DVD \\"Percussion and Drums School\\" (Curci 1995); she participated in the recording of the CD accompanying the book \\"Beyond the Rudiments\\" (Carisch 2004); she wrote essays, compositions and methods. Particular highlights include the work released in two volumes \\"Music Between Rhythm and Creativity\\" (Curci 1987): a project in collaboration with Antonio Buonomo, for which the newspaper \\"Corriere della Sera\\" devoted a full page review) and \\"Il Braccio del Tempo\\" (Simeoli 2015): a handbook that reveals the \\"secrets\\" of the orchestra pit, with amusing anecdotes about the conductors. It clarifies the concept of \\"visual rhythm\\" and concludes with polyrhythm exercises for two and three voices. Her profession as a soloist and orchestra conductor always ran alongside her work as a teacher and conductor of percussion ensembles. After teaching at conservatories in Benevento, Foggia, Potenza and Salerno, in compliance with a law that prohibited people who played in an orchestra to teach, in 1991 she was forced by the law to leave the orchestra of the Teatro di San Carlo, to maintain her role as a teacher. Becoming a tenured professor at the \\"A. Casella\\" Conservatory in Aquila, and later at the \\"Luisa D'Annunzio\\" Conservatory in Pescara, she trained an entire generation of soloists, conductors and teachers. In her spare time, Clara Perra was a voluntary for blood donor association AVIS (Italian Association for Blood Donation) and the C.R.I. (Italian Red Cross). For this reason, due to a mild illness, she was taken to the hospital by her own colleagues where she was observed for a long time.

He never completed university yet did significant original research in both microscopy and telescopy. He was the first to apply the principle of scanning in imaging, which later became important in a wide range of technologies including television, radar, and scanning electron microscopy.Novotny (2011) He was the older brother of distinguished mathematician and theoretical physicist John Lighton Synge. Early life and education Edward Hutchinson Synge was born in 1891, in County Dublin, Ireland,Edward Hutchinson Synge in 1901 Ireland Census MyHeritage.com to Edward Synge and Ellen Frances Price. He was familiarly known as \\"Hutchie\\".Trinity (March 2012) He was the nephew of playwright John Millington Synge and the brother of John Lighton Synge who edited the collected works of Sir William Rowan Hamilton at Hutchie's urging.Donegan (2012) He and brother John were great-great-great-grandsons of Irish bishop Hugh Hamilton.Florides (2008) He is also the uncle of the mathematician Cathleen Synge Morawetz.Trinity (April 2012) Throughout his life Synge was very physically active, pursuing walking, cycling, swimming and sailing. In his later life he took up painting and was good at it. In 1908 he entered Trinity College Dublin to study Mathematics and old Irish. For three years he was a brilliant student and won several prizes and a Foundation Scholarship in mathematics in 1910. Then at the end of his third year, he came into an inheritance from his uncle John Millington Synge, and in 1913 he dropped out of university.Dublin Graduate Physics Programme (2012)  Career  Starting in 1928, with encouragement from Albert Einstein,Hebrew (2014) Hutchie launched on a period of intense productivity during which he laid the foundation for new kinds of microscopes and telescopes. Nobody, including his famous brother John, appreciated Hutchie's achievements at the time.Trinity (March 2012): Years later John Synge wrote, \\"In the course of a varied academic career, I never had a colleague as interesting intellectually as Hutchie, for his mind ranged widely over art, literature, history, philosophy and science.\\" His work was overlooked for decades,Trinity (March 2012): Hutchie's achievements ‚Ä¶ have only recently been accorded their proper place in Physics. but is now better known thanks to the book The Life and Works of Edward Hutchinson Synge published by Living Edition in 2012.Living Edition Publishers On 22 April 1928, Synge wrote to Albert EinsteinHebrew (2014) about an idea he had for a new microscopic imaging method in which an optical field scattered from a tiny gold particle could be used as a radically new light source.Novotny (2011): The gold particle, Synge argued, would act as a local probe of some sample of interest, with the scattered light transmitted through the sample and into a detector. The sample's image could then, at least in principle, be obtained by raster scanning the particle over the sample surface while continuously recording the detected light's intensity. Einstein replied that although Synge's method appeared essentially unworkable,In German: prinzipiell unbrauchbar the basic ideas seemed correct and he should publish his research. There followed a remarkable period from 1928 to 1932 in which Synge produced all of his key works which he published in the Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science.Synge (1928)Synge (1931)Synge (1932) Remarkably, he did all of this work alone, without a laboratory, and while living at his home in Dundrum in the suburbs of Dublin. By 1932 he had laid out the theory of the near-field microscope and his description was incredibly accurate.Donegan (2007) p. 28: \\"Indeed as far as I can tell, many of the ideas patented by IBM, AT&T; and others were completely described by Synge 50 years before the patents were issued. It could not have been luck, since his descriptions are quantitatively accurate and exhibit a knowledge of the technologies necessary to implement his correct notions of how a near- field instrument might work.\\" (From a letter written in 1994 by Michael Paesler of North Carolina State University to Dennis McMullan, author of a review of the prehistory of scanning microscopy published in 1990.) The idea was ahead of its time.Novotny (2007): Over the years, Synge's ideas were reinvented several times and his papers resurfaced only in the mid 1980s. In 1956 a similar theory was developed by John A. O'KeefeRubincam (2000): Applying the probe idea to microscopy led him to independently rediscover the principle of the near-field optical microscope first described by E. H. Synge in the 1920s. and in 1972, Ash and Nicholls gave the first experimental demonstration of the technique using electromagnetic radiation.Super- resolution Aperture Scanning Microscope E. A. Ash & G. Nicholls, University College, London, Nature 237, 510 ‚Äì 512 (30 June 1972); doi:10.1038/237510a0Novotny (2007) It was not until Synge's original papers re-emerged in the 1980s that his priority was finally recognised. Synge proposed a design for very large astronomical telescopes, based on multiple mirrors, an idea realised much later in Tucson, Arizona, and elsewhere.Donegan (2012): p. 30Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 1930, Series 7, Volume 10, Issue 63, pp. 353‚Äì360 He also invented a new kind of remote sensing technique using searchlights. Today this is known as Lidar, and uses pulsed lasers.Novotny (2007): Two of his papers, one on the design of a multiple- mirror telescope in 1930, and the other on the design of a microscope that can measure lengths less than the wavelength of light in 1928, both published in Philosophical Magazine, ensured Hutchie's place in the history of science.Dublin Graduate Physics Programme (2012): His visionary insights into future technology lie in what we now call nanoscience.  Later life  According to the people who knew him best, E. H. Synge suffered from what these days would be called Asperger syndrome. Becoming increasingly socially isolated, he dropped out of university in 1913 and worked alone without any support from the academic community until all work stopped in 1932. In 1936 he had a mental breakdown and was committed to a Dublin nursing home where he remained until his death in 1957. Unknown genius by Denis Weaire, John F. Donegan and Petros S.

He is known for electrical apparatus construction in the development of electric railway equipment. His inventions were so successful that even his competitors dubbed him \\"The Trolley King\\".  Early life  Short was born on October 8, 1858, at Columbus, Ohio. He was the second son of John Short (a manufacturer) and Elizabeth (Cowen) Short. He attended the Columbus public schools. He followed in his father's footsteps in mechanical technology through his father's manufacturing business in his a teenage years, as he showed that he had an aptitude towards electrical and mechanical technology of his time. He experimented with an electrical burglar alarm and other electrical devices at his home. He became an expert telegraph operator at the age of fourteen.  Mid-life  Short attended Capital University for a few semesters after graduating from high school. He then attended Ohio State University and there he was a professor's assistant helping his students in the physics department. Short attended the Centennial Exposition in 1876. He saw the Bell telephone exhibit and discovered the principle of the apparatus was basically the same as that of a similar device he had been experimenting with at the laboratory of the Ohio State University. Short then developed his device, and in 1879 patented and sold it. Short graduated from Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1880. He taught electrical engineering and physics at O.S.U. for two years. He then worked in the physics and chemistry departments at University of Denver, where he taught as a professor for five years. He was soon promoted to vice-president and expanded his departments. In 1882 his chemistry department was branched off and he concentrated on teaching and researching physics. Short interested the eminent electrician Charles Francis Brush into investing into his electrical inventions and electrical machinery improvements. They formed a new company called Brush Electric Company in 1883. In 1885 he pursued an interest in electrical apparatus construction, and development of electric railway equipment. This developed into the formation of the Short Electrical Railway Company in Ohio in 1889. At Cleveland he became a key electrical technician of Brush Electric Company. 1892 saw the merger of Short Electric Company with General Electric at which time he became a member of its Technical Board. In 1893 he left those positions and went to Cleveland to become vice-president of Walker Company in charge of their engineering department. This led to his design of motors and generators, which business developed quickly, and later merged into Westinghouse Company.  Family  He was married in Washington, D.C., July 26, 1881, to Mary F. Morrison, of Columbus, Ohio, and had three sons and one daughter. Later life and death Professor Short immigrated to England in 1899 and helped develop Dick, Kerr and Company as a consulting engineer. He died in London on October 21, 1902, from appendicitis.  Achievements  Short's technical writings were well known and he was a prolific inventor. Despite a relatively short career, Short received over 500 patents on electrical machinery worldwide on electrical devices and telephone equipment, mechanical improvements to streetcars and railroad equipment improvements. He did many things related to electrical and streetcars. He designed and produced the first electric motor that operated a streetcar without gears. The motor had its armature direct-connected to the streetcar's axle for the driving force. Short was a member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the English Institution of Electrical Engineers, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He pioneered \\"use of a conduit system of concealed feed\\" thereby eliminating the necessity of overhead wire, trolley poles and a trolley for street cars and railways. While at the University of Denver he conducted important experiments which established that multiple unit powered cars were a better way to operate trains and trolleys.

Built about 1760, it is a well-preserved example of Colonial architecture. In 1781, David Sherman is reported to have hosted a ball for officers of the French Army of the Comte de Rochambeau during their march across Connecticut. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The David Sherman House is located in southern Woodbury, on the west side of Middle Quarter Road a short way south of its junction with Old Sherman Hill Road. It shares a lot with a commercial property fronting on Connecticut Route 64, from which it is partially screened by vegetation. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, off-center central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is four bays wide, with the main entrance in the center-right bay, in front of the chimney. The entry surround, probably of early 19th century date, has fluted pilasters and a corniced entablature; the rest of the house's trim is quite simple. A 1-1/2 story ell, built about 1817, extends to the rear of the main block, which exhibits a saltbox profile. The house was built about 1760. Its principal significance is in the events of 1781, when the French forces of the Exp√©dition Particuli√®re passed through the region, en route from Providence, Rhode Island to the Siege of Yorktown in the American Revolutionary War. According to local histories first recorded in the 1870s, David Sherman offered some of those troops apples and apple cider, and hosted a social event for officers who had encamped at Newtown, and could reach his house by horse. The event was probably one of the last such social occasions for the French, who went onto tighter discipline after departing Newtown and approaching British-occupied New York City.

The South Amherst Cavaliers originally competed in the Lorain County League from 1924-1961 and then began a dual-membership with the Inland Conference in 1956 that ultimately became their league home until 1988, which is when both the league disbanded and the school itself closed. Due to finances and several failed levies, the South Amherst Board of Education began looking to merge their district with a neighboring one in the 1980s. In December 1987, Firelands Local School District approved a measure to absorb South Amherst's district, which was agreed upon by both districts in early 1988. When a petition to prevent the merger failed in March of that year, the absorption of South Amherst's district by Firelands took effect on July 1, 1988, which was the first day of the 1988‚Äì1989 school year.

History  The station opened on 3 August 1850 by the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The station was situated on the south side of Front Street on the A19. The goods shed was north of the level crossing and east of the running lines; this was closed on 9 December 1963. The station was closed on 2 November 1964. Reopening proposals There have been proposals to reintroduce passenger services to part of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway system since the 1990s; Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) also endorsed the proposal in 1998. Later, in 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£34 million proposal to restore passenger services from to . In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle and was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. The study suggested that a new Blyth Park & Ride station should be constructed close to the site of Bebside station to serve Blyth due to its close proximity to the A189 dual carriageway. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the ¬£191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. The county council has, however, continued to develop the project, announcing an additional ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019, with the first passenger services potentially being introduced on the line in 2022. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. As such, the proposed station at Bebside (now referred to as Blyth Bebside) is no longer included in the initial ¬£90 million phase and is instead proposed as part of Phase 2 of the project. The North East Joint Transport Committee's bid for ¬£377 million of funding from the UK Government's ¬£1.28 billion Transfroming Cities Fund, submitted on 20 June 2019, includes ¬£99 million to fund the first phase of the Newcastle to Ashington Northumberland Line project, while further work is ongoing to secure additional public and private investment.

It concerns the last eventful years in the life of an old widow. Elkin won the 1995 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for this work.  Plot  Mrs. Dorothy Bliss is an old woman in her early 80s living alone in a retirement community near Miami Beach, Florida, after her husband's death due to cancer. She was born in Russia and is Jewish. Her mother bribed an immigration officer and added three years to her age on legal documents in order that she could start working in Manhattan's Lower East Side after their immigration. Her husband, Ted Bliss, had a butcher shop in Chicago and together they had three kids. Her oldest son dies of cancer at a young age and after her husband's retirement, the couple moved to Florida. She is obsessed with cleaning and also keeps records of the gifts given to her grandchildren in order to keep track and stay impartial with everyone. The single life of Mrs. Bliss is now filled with expectations of finding a romance or a partner but eventually she is disappointed and heartbroken. She gets involved with Alcibiades Chitral, a drug lord who operates in her neighborhood, and starts using her and her husband's car as a front for his activities. The story keeps introducing various new men in her life, such as Hector Camerando, a jai alai pro who helps Mrs. Bliss with some tips on dogs, and Tommy Auveristas, an imposter. Junior Yellin, a once upon a time lover with whom Mrs. Bliss had had a passionate encounter in her husband's butcher shop, also makes a re-entry into her life. She eventually dies when Hurricane Andrew hits Miami and brings massive destruction.  Publication  Following Elkin's death on 31 May 1995 at age 65, the novel was released posthumously on 7 September 1995. Elkin had published ten novels, five short-story collections, and various novellas and non-fiction articles in various magazines and papers during the course of his writing career, which began in the 1950s.  Review and reception  Kirkus Reviews writes that Elkin makes readers believe that the novel has a plot when drug dealers are introduced in it. However, \\"there isn't so much a plot as an accumulation of detail about Mrs. Bliss\\". Elkin's \\"long poetic sentences about seemingly mundane minutiae\\" later bring substance to the character of Mrs. Bliss. Walter Goodman, a television critic for The New York Times, mentions in his review that \\"[the book] may not be Stanley Elkin's best, but it is a smart, generous, melancholy, funny, even elegiac work by a prodigious practitioner\\". Publishers Weekly writes that \\"Elkin is at his best here, blessed with the gift of one- liner insight and a definite, if reluctantly exercised, ability to tug on a reader's heartstrings\\".  Awards  Elkin won the 1995 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel. The book was nominated along with Independence Day (by Richard Ford), Galatea 2.2 (by Richard Powers, Moo (by Jane Smiley), and The Tent of Orange Mist (by Paul West).

The museum is located underneath the piazza of the cathedral and has a collection consisting of about 300 works of which 100 are on display, exhibited in the museum's nine sections.  History  The museum was founded in 1941, by bishop Giuseppe Placido Nicolini. Its original location was on the ground floor of the parish office, and consisted of four rooms and an annex of historical archives. Entrance was through the cathedral itself and the museum could be visited only by appointment. In the 1990s bishop Sergio Goretti, in addition to encouraging the regular daily opening of the old exhibition spaces, began to consider a reorganization that would be more appropriate for the museum's objects. This gave rise to the project of expanding and refurbishing the museum's space to make it more suitable to the collection. Following the reconstruction of the earthquake of 1997 and the Jubilee year the spaces underneath the palazzo dei canonici, the cloister, and the crypt were restored. The final exhibition space, now on two floors, was finished and opened to the public on 15 April 2006. The museum now has two entrances, one still found in the cathedral itself (near the chapel of the Holy Eucharist) and a second in the piazza (at the entrance of the palazzo of the canons).  Exhibition spaces  = Corridor = In the corridor are archeological displays of items found in the immediate area, including capitals sculpted in limestone, rediscovered in the crypt but originally from the cathedral, and datable to between the 8th and the 12th centuries. Among the items from the Roman era is the front of the sarcophagus with Nikai Clipeofore and the libation rite dated to the 2nd century. The corridor = Master of St. Clare room = In the St. Clare room are detached frescoes attributed to the Master of Santa Chiara, an anonymous artist of the 13th century that takes his name from an icon found in the Basilica of St. Clare in Assisi. Originally these frescoes decorated an area above today's chapel of the Madonna del Pianto which corresponds to the old left apse of the cathedral that was separated from the rest of the church with the modifications of Galeazzo Alessi in the 16th century. = Nicol√≤ Alunno room = This room has the polyptych of San Rufino (1462) by Foligno artist Nicol√≤ di Liberatore (also known as l'Alunno). In the predella are scenes of the martyrdom of San Rufino, the patron of the city of Assisi, including the miraculous finding of his body and its transfer into the walls of the city. Also in this area are two predellas by Dono Doni (1563) as well as sacred vessels and liturgical vestments from the 17th through the 19th centuries. = Crypt of San Rufino = The Romanesque crypt of San Rufino (11th century) is divided into three naves with an apse and has vaulted arches supported by columns resting on arches. The symbols of the four evangelists are carved into the vaults and are dated to the middle of the 11th century. Inside the crypt is a Roman sacrophagus from the beginning of the third century depicting the myth of Selene and Endimone in which the body of San Rufino was originally placed. Also visible in the crypt is part of a Roman wall in opus quadratum, that was rediscovered underneath the cathedral. The crypt is one of the places that Francis of Assisi went to pray when preaching in the cathedral. Crypt of San Rufino - 11th century = Cloister = The cloister (11th century) is surrounded by old portico with arches and capitals, and has at its center a well from the Roman era, known as the pozzo della Mensa. = Diocesan room = This room houses objects from the churches and monuments of the diocesan territory. Of special interest is the work of Matteo da Gualdo.raffigurante la Madonna col Bambino e i santi Antonio Abate e Francesco d'Assisi = Confraternity room = This room contains objects from the oratories of the confraternities of Assisi and a few processional banners, the oldest of which dates to 1378 and belonged to the Confraternity of St. Francis of the Stigmata.

Together with endothelins (ETs), they form a homogenous family of strong vasoconstrictor isopeptides. Among them, few slightly different substances can be named, as SRTX-a, SRTX-b, SRTX-c, which were initially derived from Atractaspis engaddensis. Each contains twenty-one amino acid residues that spontaneously fold into a defined tertiary structure with two interchain-cysteine linkages (disulfide bonds) and a long hydrophobic tail. There are also other compounds, however, they are mostly derivations of previously mentioned ones. The main differences in the family of endothelin and sarafotoxins appear at N-terminal of peptides, as C-terminal in all of them is almost the same. Safarotoxin (and endothelin) schematic pathway representation.  History  In 1989, few months after reporting discovery and describing structure of endothelin, the sequences of first sarafotoxins were published, SRTX-a, SRTX-b, SRTX-c. Similarity to endothelins structure sparked experiments comparing both groups and proving related activity of them in tested subjects. In the same year (1989), article describing synthesis of SRTX-b was published, with analysis of vasoconstricting activity of synthesized compounds. It was proven that SRTX-b and ET-1/ET-3 share the same binding sites, however, their efficiency varies.  Synthesis  SRTXs are abundant in venoms, whereas ETs are present in a low concentration in mammals. Both, ETs and SRTXs are generated in vivo by proteolytic cleavage from larger precursors. They also can be produced by solid phase peptide synthesis and fold spontaneously in vitro in high yield into native tertiary structures with the correct disulfide bond pairing of cysteines. SRTXs complete cDNA sequence comprises 1948 base pairs (bp) coding for a pre-pro-polypeptide of 543 amino acids which starts with a methionine that initiates translation followed by a hydrophobic peptide characteristic of a signal sequence. The amino acid sequence comprises one sequence of 39 amino acidic residues followed by 11 sequences of 40 residues, each of it contains one SRTX sequence preceded by 19 spacer amino acids. The SRTX-c isoform is the most abundant in the venom and is also the isoform with the greatest number of copies (five in all) in the precursor.  Metabolism  In case of ET/SRTX binding to a receptors and creation of a receptor-ligand complexes in various tissues, very slow pace of a dissociation is observed. In experiments conducted on rats, half-time of SRTX-b in ileum is about 7 min (with comparison of 2 hours in case of ET-3), while in the cerebellum, the t1/2 values are more than 2‚Äì3 hours for both, SRTX-b and ET-1, while in case of ET-3, the dissociation rate is negligible. Iodinated SRTX-b binds specifically to preparations of atrial membranes with a maximum binding capacity of 110 fmol per mg of protein and a dissociation constant (KD) of 3‚Äì5 nM. SRTX-a, SRTX-b and STRX-c inhibit binding of iodinated SRTX-b in atrium at mean inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 30, 25 and 100 nM, respectively. Other binding experiments have also shown that 125I-SRTX-b recognizes sites in rat cerebellum KD = 3.5 nM and cerebral cortex KD=0.3nM. Furthermore, it has been shown that: * 1. A mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ ions is closely connected with a biological activity of sarafotoxins; * 2. The blockers specific to Ca2+ channels, such as verapamil or ninodipine, have no effect on binding capability of 125I-SRTX-b; * 3. The hydrolysis of phosphoinositides is induced by binding of SRTXs. Above characteristics suggest that sarafotoxins (and endothelins) use the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway via specific receptors coupled to G protein, which seems to activate type C and D phospholipases. However, distinct and widespread subtypes of glycosylated receptors are recognized functionally by SRTXs and ETs. As all of the three isoforms of endothelins and sarafotoxins interplay with the same affinity, ETB-R appears less selective than ETA-R. Nonetheless, the variable tissue distribution of the endothelin-binding sites, and the different biological effects demonstrated within different organs, indicate possibility of an existence of other endothelin/sarafotoxin subtypes of receptors. Therefore, ability of Egyptian mongoose to resist very high concentrations of SRTX-b may be due to presence of additional family of binding sites, located in cardiovascular tissue, differentiating ET-1 and SRTX-b.  Mechanism of action  Sarafotoxins share very high structural and functional homology with ETs, and thus activate endothelin-receptors, endothelin receptor type A (ETA) and endothelin receptor type B (ETB). These receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors. ETB receptors bind ETs and SRTXs with little selectivity whereas ETA receptors show greater affinity for ET-1, ET-2 and SRTX-b, over ET-3 and SRTX-c. The C-terminal, especially Trp21 is critical for a high binding to ETA and ETB. The activation of these receptors results in elevation of intracellular free calcium. ETA receptors mediate vasoconstriction and cell proliferation and ETB receptors are important for the release of nitric oxide (vasodilation) and prostacyclin and inhibition of Endothelin Converting Enzyme (ECE), that synthesizes ET-1. By increasing vasoconstriction, sarafotoxins cause bronchoconstriction, increasing airway resistance. The bronchoconstriction is also caused by left ventricular dysfunction, caused by the SRTXs. Left ventricular relaxation is impaired which may induce an elevation in pulmonary microvascular hydrostatic pressure which would in turn lead to edema in the lungs, constricting the bronchi.  Pharmacology  In test with rabbits, significant improvement in protection against arrhythmic effects and infarct size reduction was observed after administrating exogenously SRTX-c (in dosage of 0.24 nmol/kg, i.v.) prior the coronary occlusion accident. That was achieved thanks to ability of SRTX-c to activate selected ETB receptors. In rat thoracic aorta, the contractile activity is grouped as follows: ET-1 > SRTX-b > SRTX-a > SRTX-c at lower concentrations, but SRTX-b > ET-1 > SRTX-a > SRTX-c at higher concentrations. Intra-arterial injections of SRTX-b causes a dose- dependent increase in perfusion pressure at doses ranging from 30 to 300 pmol. The vasoconstrictor activity of SRTX-b is less remarkable than that of ET-1 at doses lower than 100 pmol, while at a dose of 300 pmol the activity of SRTX-b is greater than that of ET-1. The time required for the recovery of perfusion pressure to baselines after a bolus injection of 300 pmol SRTX-b is shorter than that of ET-1. The threshold vasoconstrictor dose of SRTX-a is 3 times larger than that of SRTX-b. At a dose of 300 pmol, the rise in perfusion pressure due to SRTX-a is about 8 times smaller than that of SRTX-b. SRTX-c exhibits a feeble vasoconstriction producing very small increase in perfusion pressure.  Toxicity  SRTX-b and SRTX-a are highly lethal and cause cardiac arrest and death in mice within minutes of intravenous administration, LD50 for mice was detected for about 0.015 mg/kg body weight and LD50 0.3 mg/kg in case of SRTX-c.  Effects  In humans there are local effects which appear within minutes: edema, erythema and numbness, following by systemic effects which include general weakness, sweating, pallor, fluctuations in the level of consciousness, vomiting, watery non-bloody diarrhea, high blood pressure, liver damage, hemorrhage, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypercapnia and disorders of cardiac activity. The reports of cardiac disorders describe a prolonged P-R interval and changes in the S-T segment. The cardiac disorders may be due to either direct effects of the venom to the heart or to hypoxia caused by respiratory disturbances.  Effects on animals  In mice and rat: it is been shown that Sarafotoxin has three independent effects in the both mouse and rat heart, a rapid and marked vasoconstriction of the coronary vessels, a severe atrioventricular block, and a slower but very strong positive inotropic effect. It also binds with a high affinity to the membranes of atrial and brain to induce hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in these tissues. In a study investigating the impact of sarafotoxin-b on respiratory properties, it was found that there was a marked increase in airway resistance. This was likely caused by bronchoconstriction. Bronchoconstriction occurred due to constriction of smooth muscle and airway wall thickening due to peribronchial edema. This peribronchial edema is likely caused by impairment of left ventricular relaxation, elevating microvascular hydrostatic pressure. Proving this theory of edema, during investigation, abundant and frothy fluid was found in tracheal cannulas after sarafotoxin injection. The same study also found marked disturbances in gas exchange and acid-base equilibrium after injection with the toxin. Acute hypoxemia was due to bronchoconstriction and pulmonary edema. Hypoxemia was associated with metabolic acidosis and the increase in the anion gap may have been due to increased blood lactates induced by hypoxia. There was also a measured decrease in PCO‚ÇÇ, which may be explained by decreased cardiac output. decreasing carbon dioxide transport to the lung.  Research and clinical uses  Lauer-Fields et al. (2007), are using C-terminally truncated SRTX-b to act as a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor. The removal of the C-terminal eliminates its toxic vasopressive activity and also the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor activity, however with further amino acid changes, the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activity is regained and enhanced. This modified sarafotoxin is useful for treating some pathological conditions including arthritis, cardiovascular diseases and tumor cell metastasis.

The album is a collection of reworked folksongs, arranged and sung by Amidon, accompanying himself on guitar and banjo, with a band consisting of Bill Frisell, Shahzad Ismaily and Chris Vatalaro. The album was recorded and mixed by Valgeir Sigur√∞sson at Greenhouse Studios in Reykjavik, Iceland and was released on Nonesuch Records in 2014. Background and recording Lily-O emerged from Amidon's collaboration with guitarist Bill Frisell, who had been a hero of Amidon's since his youth. Starting in 2011, Frisell and Amidon collaborated in an array of contexts, starting with Amidon's appearing as a guest with Frisell's Beautiful Dreamers Trio in Ludwigsburg, Germany; a brief duo tour of the Northeastern US by the two musicians; and a concert by Frisell featuring Amidon, jazz pianist Jason Moran, and singer Alicia Hall Moran at Jazz at Lincoln Center. For the Lily-O album, Amidon decided to bring Frisell to Iceland to record at Greenhouse Studios with Amidon's longtime collaborators Shahzad Ismaily on electric bass and Chris Vatalaro on drums and live electronics. Amidon did not share the songs with the band beforehand but instead taught them as they went, with the group's arrangements coming together as they recorded. The band recorded their tracks live on the floor over the course of three days, with very few overdubs.

Life  Gadit was born on 26 November 1938 in Kandivali, Mumbai to Gokaldas Gadit and Santok. He studied Gujarati and Sanskrit at Gujarat University and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961 and a Master of Arts degree in 1964. In 1974 he received his PhD under Harivallabh Bhayani. Gadit taught at the art colleges of Petlad and Mahudha from 1965 to 1977. He worked as a professor in the postgraduate department of Sardar Patel University from 1977 to 1986 and headed the Gujarati department there before retiring at the age of 60. He also worked as the Reader in K. L. Study Center, a research center of Gujarati Sahitya Parishad. He married Manjula in 1963, and had two sons. He died of cancer on 29 May 2009 in Vadodara, India.  Works  He started his literary career with Avrut (1969), a novel which deals with the theme of corruption in the field of education, and presents the inner life of its central character. The dreams and symbols are used to depict the futility of life. He published two novellas in one volume entitled Chaspakshi ane Karna in 1979. In Chaspakshi, Gadit depicted the personal relationship of Mr. Panchal and Mrs. Soni, their sexual sensations and its psychological backgrounds. Badlati Kshitij (English: Changing Horizon) was published in 1986 and is based on the riots that ignited after anti-reservation protests. He started to write a novel of the life of Mahatma Gandhi, publishing three parts, but it was not completed due to his death. Kya Chhe Ghar? (1982) is a social novel, while Shikhandi (1991) is centered around the life of Shikhandi, a famous character from the Mahabharata. Prashanmu (2002) was inspired by the mass migration of Dalits of Sambarada village near Palanpur. Ek Aswapna Sukhi Jeevan (2003) is a social novel on family life. Satya (2010) was his last novel centered around Mahatma Gandhi. He also adapted the novel Shikhandi into a play of the same name.

It had one main line going south to Ripon and Harrogate and one main line north to Northallerton with one lesser line going east to Thirsk Town and also connecting with the East Coast Main Line at Thirsk railway station. Its one other line was a branch to Masham. History The station was opened to traffic in June 1848 when the line to Ripon opened up southwards from Thirsk Town. At the opening of the station it was known as Wath, but this was changed in February 1852 to Melmerby. The station lay equidistant between the two villages from where it was named after. Last to open was the branch to Masham which was formally inaugurated on the 9 June 1875. The Masham Branch shared platforms with the Northallerton line and there was one large 'V' shaped island platform between the Northallerton and Thirsk lines. In 1901 the line to Northallerton was doubled and given a connection to the main line at Northallerton station (rather than access being limited to the Stockton line). This switched the importance of the Northallerton and Thirsk lines around with heavy and important traffic going on the Northallerton line and the route to Thirsk being downgraded into a secondary line, although it retained a healthier local service because of a larger population along the route. The Masham branch was the first to lose its passengers. Officially, the closure date was New Year's Day 1931, which means that traffic last ran on the last day of 1930, but freight trains still used the branch until November 1963. After the passenger traffic was curtailed on the Masham Branch, the Northallerton bound platform was moved further north so that it was only accessible to trains going to Northallerton. [This is not completely correct, although it is what is stated on the 'Disused Stations' website as referenced below. In fact while passenger traffic to Masham ceased in December 1930, the OS 25\\" map of 1928/9 shows that the platform had already been moved, (meaning it was definitely done between 1912, the date of the previous map, and 1929). Indeed some photos show that it was originally double-sided, serving both the Northallerton and Masham lines, before being demolished by BR and replaced by a small single-sided platform on the main line only. According to Ken Hoole, the platform was moved in 1913 in connection with a redesign related to the closure of one of the two signal boxes at Melmerby. It is possible that at some time somebody was confused by the date of passenger service cessation (1931) and the date of the platform change (1913) and assumed a connection which has been perpetuated].'The Masham Branch' North Eastern Express No.36, S.L Rankin, with addendum by Ken Hoole As the line to Thirsk had been downgraded and traffic moved away, it became the earliest full casualty being closed completely in September 1959. The line, and all stations between Northallerton and Harrogate, were officially closed in March 1967 as part of the Beeching closures. The line was re-opened temporarily for three days (in July and August 1967) to northbound traffic due to an accident on the East Coast Main Line at Thirsk. A private dwelling now sits on the site of the station, whilst a haulage depot now occupies the former goods sidings south of the Melmerby to Wath road.

It is located at the former Pauli Murray Family Home at 906 Carroll Street in Durham, North Carolina, the house where Murray was raised. In 2015, the property was named a national treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.http://paulimurrayproject.org/becoming-involved/ The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016. Building The Pauli Murray Center is located in Durham's West End, on a .27-acre plot of land on the west side of Carroll Street north of Morehead Avenue. The building, unlike its neighbors, is set back from the street, from which it is separated by a long lawn. It is a modest -story frame building and was more commonly referred to as \\"a story and a jump\\" due to the small, low-ceilinged second floor.http://thepaulimurrayhouse.weebly.com/about.html It has a side gable roof and its exterior is clad in German siding. A gable rises above the front entrance, which is sheltered by a porch. The house is not architecturally distinguished. (marked \\"Draft\\"; includes photos) =Building history= The maternal grandparents of Pauli Murray, Robert and Cornelia Fitzgerald, purchased the once-larger, one-acre parcel of land in 1898 for $200. The present house was built soon afterward. It is here that Murray was raised, by her grandparents and aunts, from the age of three after her mother died. Education was emphasized in this environment, and Murray went on to a long and varied career as a civil rights activist, legal theorist, writer, and Episcopalian priest. She was on the forefront of attempts to gain admission to racially segregated institutions of higher learning in the 1930s, and experimented with acts of civil disobedience against racial segregation in the American South that would become important elements of the successful civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s. She wrote legal treatises and court briefs that have shaped a generation of civil rights jurisprudence and legislation, and wrote a seminal work describing in detail the segregationist laws of each state. United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explicitly credited Murray as a contributor to some of her legal briefs advancing the rights of women. Murray described her memories of the house In her 1956 memoir, Proud Shoes: The Story of An American Family. She wrote that, after her grandfather Robert Fitzgerald was blinded during the Civil War, he supervised the building of the house by touch. \\"It was as if he had built himself into the structure, for it had his stubborn character,\\" she wrote, adding that the house \\"was more than a home; it was a monument to Grandfather's courage and tenacity.\\" =Restoration= The restoration project began in July 2015, when the Pauli Murray Center for History and Social Justice received a $4,500 grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to produce a historic structure report on the Pauli Murray home. The project was directed by Barbara Lau of the Duke Human Rights Center at the Franklin Humanities Institute. The report was meant to inform rehabilitation plans and provide a framework for forming a historic center at the site. The report compiled previous research, produced new research, and included information from experts.http://paulimurrayproject.org/becoming- involved/pauli-murray-family-home-preservation-action-plan/ Later in 2015, after the report was published, Iron Mountain, an information management company, provided additional funding to the Pauli Murray Center for History and Social Justice. This money enabled the organization to start preserving the foundation of the home and making exterior renovations to reverse neglect, water damage, and partial demolition.http://www.ironmountain.com/About- Us/Company-News/News-Categories/Press-Releases/2015/August/17.aspx By 2016, the project was underway. Funds from Iron Mountain and The Marion Stedman Covington Foundation were used to restore the exterior of the house to its appearance in photos taken between 1898 and 1906. Missing features, such as doors, the front porch, and windows, have been replicated. The home was also jacked up six inches in the center, the foundation was replaced, and new piers were laid to replace the ones damaged due to runoff from the public cemetery nearby. The color of the exterior was also changed from white to a blue gray shade to match the home's look in 1910.https://savingplaces.org/places/pauli- murray-house/updates/bringing-pauli-murrays-house-back-to-life#.WOvJdhLyuCQ In 2017, the National Park Service awarded the Pauli Murray Center for Historical and Social Justice a $237,575 grant through its National Park Service African American Civil Rights Grant Program.

It is said that it was the same El Greco who designed the plans of the Palace, venturing for a few months in architectural art giving free rein to his technique. The palace was a meeting place, with visits such as Tirso de Molina, Cardinal Sandoval y Rojas, Covarrubias, Priest Rivadeneyra, Ercilla, Miguel de Cervantes, Baltasar Graci√°n and the supposed father of the work El Greco. The garden was one of the most elaborate and cared of the moment being comparable to the gardens of the 16th century of the great palaces, with a varied flora, the visit of deer and gazelles and the company of statues of nymphs. As early as the 20th century the palace became part of the properties of the Count of Romanones, who had a real obsession with the rustic estates, a proof of which were the many extensions that it possessed. It is said that it was in this Palace where he wrote almost all his works. It was under the property of the Count of Romanones when the restoration of the palace-house was begun and the exteriors were adapted, giving way to a garden with meandering paths. The Palacio de Buenavista was a meeting point for many celebrities, among them, the most illustrious would undoubtedly be the presence of Alfonso XIII, who took as base field for his hunting this strategic place.

He is the son of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (\\"El Mencho\\"), Mexico's most-wanted man. Under his father, he allegedly worked as the CJNG's second-in-command and managed international drug trafficking operations. Oseguera Gonz√°lez was first arrested in January 2014 in Jalisco, but was released in October for lack of evidence and re-arrested immediately as he walked out of prison. He was then released again in December after a judge considered the evidence against him as insufficient. In June 2015, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was arrested again, released a month later, and re-arrested as his release order was made official. His legal case has highlighted the growing tensions and deficiencies between prosecutors and judges in Mexico. In 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charged Oseguera Gonz√°lez with international drug trafficking. According to the indictment, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was responsible for shipping narcotics to the U.S. from Mexico between 2007 and 2017, and of using violence to further his criminal activities. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs approved his extradition request in 2018, and Oseguera Gonz√°lez's motions to prevent his transfer to the U.S. have been denied. In Mexico, he was facing trial for money laundering and illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms. After several appeals, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was extradited to the U.S. in February 2020. Early life and career Rub√©n Oseguera Gonz√°lez was born on 14 February 1990, in San Francisco County, California. He also holds Mexican citizenship. He has several aliases, including \\"Rub√©n Garibay Gonz√°lez\\", \\"El Junior\\", \\"El Rubencito\\", \\"El Rojo\\", \\"El Ni√±o\\", and \\"El Menchito\\". His last nickname is a diminutive of his father's nickname El Mencho, which comes from the phonetic derivation of his name Nemesio. His mother, Rosalinda Gonz√°lez Valencia, is the sister of Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia, a former leader of the Milenio Cartel and Los Cuinis. His father, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and one of Mexico's most-wanted men. Oseguera Gonz√°lez has two sisters, Jessica Johana and Laisha. According to Mexican government sources, Oseguera Gonz√°lez acted as the CJNG's second-in-command, just below his father. He was allegedly responsible for managing the CJNG's operations in buying and selling narcotics from South America to Mexico. He was also accused of coordinating stolen gasoline sales in Jalisco, leading a group of hitmen who killed people who refused to work with the CJNG, overseeing a line of hitmen responsible for protecting CJNG's turf in Jalisco and Colima from rival gangs like the Knights Templar Cartel and Los Zetas, and managing the CJNG's financial assets. 2014 arrest Since 2013, Mexican authorities were investigating a public telephone booth line and two cellphones linked with high-ranking leaders of the CJNG. According to intelligence reports, one of the mobile lines received a call from the public booth line from a neighborhood Jardines Universidad in Zapopan, Jalisco, prompting an investigation. The Mexican Army asked the Criminal Investigation Agency (AIC) branch of the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) to investigate the neighborhood and the two mobile lines more closely. The Army began to dispatch undercover agents to monitor the neighborhood. On the evening of 29 January 2014, one of the mobile phones was located through geolocation at a neighborhood in Zapopan before it went out of service. The Army and the Navy decided to send a Special Forces unit from Mexico City to Zapopan to investigate the incident. At 3:30 am. CT on 30 January, the Special Forces unit raided a residence in neighborhood Patria Universidad and discovered Oseguera Gonz√°lez sleeping there. As the authorities took down the doors, Oseguera Gonz√°lez woke up from the loud noise and jumped from his bed, ran to his backyard, and climbed the back wall to reach his neighbor's property. However, the Special Forces unit successfully surrounded the premises and reduced Oseguera Gonz√°lez's escape options. He eventually submitted and was arrested in his neighbor's backyard. Two of his henchmen surrendered at the door without resisting arrest. Two others, who were renting a nearby house, fled on foot but were arrested too. Oseguera Gonz√°lez reportedly offered the officers who detained him around MXN$17 million to let him go. Authorities confirmed that they confiscated between MXN$10 to $16 million and US$500,000 at the crime scene, as well as 4 assault rifles, 9 handguns, a grenade, and several rounds of ammunition. Former Attorney General of Mexico Jes√∫s Murillo Karam confirmed to the press that no gunshots were fired in the operation. Oseguera Gonz√°lez was flown that day to Mexico City and taken to the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, where he gave his statement and was interrogated by law enforcement. Government sources confirmed that he had no pending formal investigations or arrest warrants issued against him in Jalisco. On 1 February, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was taken to Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as \\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico. Authorities confirmed that he was arrested because of pending charges of money laundering, drug trafficking, and illegal possession of weapons of military-exclusive use. Oseguera Gonz√°lez pleaded not guilty and claimed that he worked in construction and was a car salesperson since he was 16 years old. He also claimed that he inherited properties from his mother after she bought them when he was younger and put them under his name. In response to the military operation that resulted in Oseguera Gonz√°lez's arrest, CJNG gunmen hijacked three buses and set them on fire throughout the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. No deaths or injuries were reported. The U.S. consulate in Guadalajara sent a warning to U.S. citizens in the city and asked them not to travel in the southern part of the urban area, including the main roads leading to the Guadalajara International Airport. Once the attacks concluded, the Mexican government asked civilians to remain calm and resume their daily activities. Authorities stated that they would remain on alert throughout the Guadalajara area for other violent responses from organized crime. =Releases= On 16 October 2014, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was released from Altiplano, but he was re-arrested immediately as he walked out of prison by members of the AIC. He was released because a judge from the State of Mexico absolved him from the following crimes: illegal possession of firearms, having weapons of military-exclusive use, use of resources from illicit origins, and crimes against public health. Once in custody, he was then taken to the SEIDO installations and imprisoned there for two months while the PGR worked on getting his jurisdiction to open a trial against him. On 18 December, he was sent to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 2 (also known as \\"Puente Grande\\"), a maximum-security prison in Jalisco. On 26 December, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was released from prison again after a judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence against him for the charges of drug trafficking, overseeing the CJNG's financial operations, and leading a group of hitmen. 2015 arrest On 23 June 2015, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was arrested again by the Mexican Army and the Federal Police in the Lomas de Altamira neighborhood in Zapopan, Jalisco, this time along with his brother-in-law Julio Alberto Castillo Rodr√≠guez. The operation lasted about 20 minutes and no shots were fired. The officers entered the private neighborhood in several vehicles at around 2:15 am. CT and subdued the entrance guard. They then shot the security cameras with paintball guns to obscure them, destroyed several others, and asked the guard to cut the electricity power in the vicinity. As they were in the entrance booth of the neighborhood, the telephone ran but none of them answered. The guard was then asked to kneel down while the officers entered the neighborhood and apprehended Oseguera Gonz√°lez, who was inside a vehicle with Rodr√≠guez Castillo. Authorities confiscated several weapons, including 2 customized AR-15 assault rifles engraved with the insignias \\"CJNG 02 JR\\" and \\"Menchito\\". According to government sources, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was trying keep a low profile and had undergone a nose surgery to alter his identity. He travelled without bodyguards to avoid attracting attention from law enforcement. The government officially confirmed his identity through DNA and physical tests, and photo evidence. At the time of his arrest, he was wanted for organized crime involvement, using resources from illicit origins (money laundering), and kidnapping. The government alleged that when Oseguera Gonz√°lez was released from prison the year before, he rejoined the CJNG and began managing their international drug trafficking operations. Once in custody, he was sent to Mexico City and transferred to the SEIDO installations, where he gave his formal declaration. As Oseguera Gonz√°lez arrived at the SEIDO via helicopter, a Blackhawk Federal Police helicopter with snipers guarded the premises. On 27 June, a federal judge in Toluca issued an arrest warrant for Oseguera Gonz√°lez. He was then transferred to Altiplano prison. Oseguera Gonz√°lez's defense argued that their client was detained on illegal grounds because some of the charges he was arrested for were absolved by a judge before, thus causing double jeopardy. The PGR countered this argument by saying that the judge's actions did not mean an absolute resolution from the charges imposed. =Release and re-arrest= On 1 July 2015, a federal judge from the State of Mexico ordered Oseguera Gonz√°lez's release after concluding that the evidence against him was insufficient and that his due process had been violated. The judge stated that when Oseguera Gonz√°lez was arrested in June, the officers did not have an arrest warrant against him and entered his private property without legal authorization. He also stated that the detainee was in custody for 9 hours and without a lawyer before he was sent to the justice department. When the judge considered that authorities had failed to prove that Oseguera Gonz√°lez was involved in organized crime, he was released. This was the third time he had been released in less than a year. However, as Oseguera Gonz√°lez was walked out of Altiplano, he was re-arrested by the PGR, who had a pending arrest warrant against him. According to government sources, he was wanted for organized crime involvement and for participating in the disappearance of two individuals in Tepalcatepec, Michoac√°n. He was sent again to the SEIDO installations by helicopter and escorted by an armed Blackhawk helicopter. On 3 July, a federal court approved the PGR's request to keep Oseguera Gonz√°lez under a 40-day preventative detention while authorities work on gathering more evidence against the defense. The request was carried out as part of an investigation by the SEIDO against Oseguera Gonz√°lez for his alleged participation in kidnapping. Oseguera Gonz√°lez's defense, however, responded by issuing a writ of amparo in hopes of preventing their client from being detained without charges being filed. A judge denied the defense's request to remove their client's preventative detention on 16 July. On 12 August, a federal judge approved the PGR's request to extend Oseguera Gonz√°lez's preventative detention for 40 additional days in order to allow authorities to continue working on gathering evidence against the defense. Later that day, the PGR decided to remove his preventative detention after considering that they had found enough evidence against him. On 13 August, he was issued an arrest warrant and transferred to Altiplano prison on organized crime and bribery charges. The kidnapping charges were suspended. Oseguera Gonz√°lez was also investigated for his alleged participation in the murder of four people at a restaurant in Zapopan on 17 May 2013. According to the detainees, Oseguera Gonz√°lez planned the attack. Imprisonment and legal status On 28 August 2015, a federal court issued an arrest warrant against Oseguera Gonz√°lez and charged him with illegal possession of firearms, using ammunition of exclusive military use, having five weapons of exclusive military use, and organized crime involvement. In October, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was transferred from Altiplano to Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 3 (also known as \\"Noreste\\") in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. He issued a writ of amparo after claiming that he endured mistreatment and torture. That same month, the PGR opened another case and issued another arrest warrant to charge Oseguera Gonz√°lez for acting as the CJNG's second-in-command and ordering homicides against rival drug members. They also stated that he was responsible for coordinating international drug trafficking shipments. The evidence presented to the court consisted of intelligence reports gathered by law enforcement and lawyers. On 4 November, a federal court charged Oseguera Gonz√°lez with drug trafficking along with five other suspected CJNG members. Oseguera Gonz√°lez issued another writ of amparo in early 2016 to request a transfer back to Altiplano. In February 2016, however, he was transferred to Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 13 in Miahuatl√°n de Porfirio D√≠az, Oaxaca. His defense responded by preparing a writ of amparo for the supposed violations against their client. On 30 June, the PGR via a federal judge in Toluca issued an arrest warrant against Oseguera Gonz√°lez and charged him with illegal possession of firearms, using ammunition of military-exclusive weapons, being in possession of at least five military-exclusive weapons, and organized crime involvement. On 22 August, the writ of amparo for mistreatment and torture issued months before was struck down by a judge after he spoke with the prison staff, who denied their involvement in such violations. On 10 November, a judge approved Oseguera Gonz√°lez's request to receive a conjugal visit. The defendant claimed that he was limited by the prison staff from speaking to his lawyers in the past. The judge did not comment on this matter. On 21 February, a court approved Oseguera Gonz√°lez's writ of amparo and invalidated his formal imprisonment for organized crime charges. The judge concluded that the charges had several flaws and the evidence presented was insufficient. According to the court, Oseguera Gonz√°lez's organized crime charges were based on the testimonies of two Federal Police officers, who described to investigators that he was part of the leadership structure of the CJNG. The judge did not consider this evidence sufficient because the police did not establish how or where they got this information. The PGR submitted the weapons seized during Oseguera Gonz√°lez's arrests, and a cap with the insignias of the CJNG that Oseguera Gonz√°lez had in his possession when he was taken into custody, as evidence of his alleged involvement in organized crime. They also mentioned his biological relationship with his father and the fact that two alleged members of the CJNG told investigators that Oseguera Gonz√°lez worked below him as evidence. The judge did not agree that the weapons and the cap proved Oseguera Gonz√°lez's militancy in the CJNG. The judge also dismissed the two testimonies of the alleged CJNG members because they gave conflicting assertions when investigators showed them a picture of Oseguera Gonz√°lez and asked them to identify him. Oseguera Gonz√°lez was not released from prison because he had four additional pending charges that were not invalidated by the court. On 9 March 2018, a penal court judge tried to have Oseguera Gonz√°lez transferred from Oaxaca to the Puente Grande. In July 2019, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 15, a maximum-security prison in Chiapas. Authorities did this after suspected organized crime members uploaded a video on social media warning of Oseguera Gonz√°lez's plot to escape from prison. On 29 August 2019, a federal judge absolved Oseguera Gonz√°lez of organized crime involvement and ordered his immediate release. However, he was kept in custody for two additional charges: money laundering and illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms. On 6 September 2019, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 11 in Hermosillo, Sonora. The Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection (SSPC) confirmed that Oseguera Gonz√°lez stay in Sonora was temporary, and confirmed that the U.S. had an outstanding extradition request against him.  Extradition process  On 3 February 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant against Oseguera Gonz√°lez. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stated that he had been involved in importing and distributing narcotics from Mexico to the U.S. since 2011. The DEA stated that Oseguera Gonz√°lez had several other aliases, including \\"Rubencito\\", \\"El Rojo\\", \\"El Ruso\\", and \\"El Ni√±o\\". According to the report, the United States Department of Justice was going to seize all of Oseguera Gonz√°lez assets in the U.S. that were a result of his drug proceeds. With the arrest warrant, the U.S. government could formally request his extradition to the U.S. On 4 October 2018, Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (SRE) approved Oseguera Gonz√°lez's extradition to the U.S. He issued a writ of amparo to prevent his extradition. On 16 October 2018, the United States Department of State, Treasury, and Justice announced a joint law enforcement measure against the CJNG, and publicized previously sealed indictments charging Oseguera Gonz√°lez. The report stated that between 2007 and February 2017, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was responsible for importing and distributing narcotics in the U.S. from Mexico, and of using firearms during and to retaliate for his alleged drug trafficking activities. The U.S. government confirmed that the extradition of Oseguera Gonz√°lez was pending. In July 2019, Oseguera Gonz√°lez's writ of amparo issued against the SRE's extradition approval was denied. His defense argued that Oseguera Gonz√°lez was not the person the U.S. government was looking for, and that he was not the son of Oseguera Cervantes. This statement was provided by the defense and support by one of their witnesses. In addition, Oseguera Gonz√°lez's defense argued that extraditing him to the U.S. would be unconstitutional because the charges he faces in the U.S. could carry life imprisonment, a conviction length that does not exist in Mexico. On 21 February 2020, Oseguera Gonz√°lez was extradited to the U.S. He arrived in Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C. and appeared before a judge that day to face his outstanding charges.

Its species were formerly placed in the genus Avicularia. Description Ybrapora consists of species that are smaller than most aviculariines. Females have strongly curved, almost non-sclerotized (i.e. non- hardened) spermathecae. The tibial apophysis (outgrowth) on the first leg is absent or small. Individuals show major colour changes as they mature. Immature spiders have a central reddish mark with jagged edges running along the centre of the abdomen, surrounded by a dark area connected to similarly dark coloured stripes running across the abdomen. These patterns become duller or disappear in adults, particularly females.

As their common name suggests, they are a small species that usually 15 to 20 millimeters wide. They typically grow in clusters that completely cover an area like a patch of moss. The namesake sticky dew at the ends of their leaves is designed to trap insects so that the plants can absorb nutrients as the insect decomposes. Distribution Drosera pulchella is found in Western Australia where there is a moderate Mediterranean climate. It is one of many species of Drosera that can be found there. There are about 50 species of pygmy sundews distributed mostly throughout Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. Habitat and ecology This species can typically be found in areas with lots of moisture year round such as swamps, creeks, lakes and forests. Unusual among sundews, these plants have to be able to cope with the Australian dry season, so they have developed extensive roots so that they can obtain water when it becomes scarce. They also have to compensate for the poor quality of the soil they live in, which is the main theory why they evolved to catch insects. Morphology Drosera pulchella 2 Darwiniana The plant itself is low to the ground with its leaves surrounding a central bud. On the ends of the leaves are tentacle-like projections that produce the sticky mucus like substance that the plant uses to trap insects. The plant lures insects in by producing a sweet smelling secretion that draws them close to the tentacles. Once the insect is caught the tentacles contract to engulf the insect and cover it with sticky mucus. Once caught in the trap the insect either dies of exhaustion or of suffocation as the sticky mucus clogs their spiracles. Reproduction Drosera pulchella flower Darwiniana Drosera pulchella can reproduce sexually and asexually depending on the conditions in its environment. Pygmy Drosera can flower at will and usually produce white, pink, yellow, orange or red flowers. While they do produce flowers they are not very efficient at producing seeds and therefore only flower when conditions are best. Most of the time they reproduce asexually by producing gemmae. The gemmae is a specialized leaf that detaches and becomes a new plant, genetically identical to the parent plant. The plant makes dozens of gemmae, so many that it pushes the leaves away from the rosette at the center creating tension. This allows the gemmae to be launched up to several meters when the plant is touched.  Uses  These tiny plants are primarily used for terrariums and indoor plants where they can be maintained and grown in stable environments.

Two adults and a child were shot to death. Four other children ranging in age from nine days to ten years old were drowned. Two others were severely injured. The murder took place at 7700 16th Street NW, a Washington, D.C. house purchased for a group of Hanafi Muslims to use as the \\"Hanafi American Mussulman's Rifle and Pistol Club\\". The property was purchased and donated by then Milwaukee Bucks basketball player, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The target of the attack was Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, the son-in-law of Reginald Hawkins. Khaalis had written and sent fifty letters calling Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad \\"guilty of 'fooling and deceiving people - robbing them of their money, and besides that dooming them to Hell.'\\" The letters were mailed to ministers of all fifty mosques of the Nation of Islam, a sect that Khaalis had infiltrated and once led. The letters were also critical of Wallace D. Fard and urged the ministers to leave the sect.  Background  At the time of the murders Black Muslims were known as the Nation of Islam (NOI) and then changed their name to World Community Islam in the West. Hamaas Abdul Khaalis was originally a Roman Catholic and Seventh-day Adventist born in Gary, Indiana as Ernest Timothy McGhee. He converted to Sunni Islam and on the advice of his Islamic teacher, Tasibur Uddein Rahman infiltrated the Black Muslims. He changed his name to Ernest 2x McGhee and served as principal of the sect's school, and then went on to become Elijah Muhammad's national secretary at their Chicago national headquarters from 1954-1957. In an interview, Khaalis said, \\"Elijah once said that I was next in line to him, that it was me, not Malcolm X.\\" Elijah Mohammad was originally born Elijah Poole. In 1957 he was demoted or lost influence in a dispute possibly after unsuccessfully trying to convince Muhammad to change the direction of the movement. He then moved to New York City where he ran the Hanafi Madh-hab center in Harlem under his Sunni Muslim name Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. In New York, he continued trying to convince members to defect from Muhammad. In 1970, Khaalis converted Kareem Abdul Jabbar, who was formerly known as Lew Alcindor. In 1971 Jabbar donated a $78,000 field stone mansion for Khaalis' headquarters in Washington, D.C. Police believe the continued efforts to convert people in New York to be a reason for the growing conflict between Sunni Muslims and Black Muslims, and may have contributed to the murders. In an interview Khaalis spoke of Malcolm X, \\"When Malcolm was killed I was teaching him the Sunni way,\\" and \\"He used to come to my house on Long Island and we would sit in his car for hours. He would meet me after he left the temple. Never in public because he knew they were after him. He was saying the wrong things.\\"  The incident  On January 12, 1973 several Black Mafia affiliates traveled to Washington, D.C and scouted the home. Then on January 17, 1973, Ronald Harvey, John Clark, James \\"Bubbles\\" Price, John Griffin, Theodore Moody, William Christian, and Jerome Sinclair traveled in two vehicles from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. One of the men called claiming to be interested in purchasing literature about the Hanafi and arranged to come to the residence to purchase the literature. Two of them came to purchase material. Khaalis' son, Daud, left the room to get change, and upon his return he was told, \\"this is a stick up.\\" The two men then let five or six additional people into the residence. Daud was killed first. He was taken to the third floor and shot. Abdu Nur was shot in a bedroom. Bibi Khaalis, one of Hamaas' wives, was forced to watch them drown two of the children in an upstairs bathtub and she was also taken to the basement where she was forced to watch them drown her nine day old granddaughter in a sink. Then Bibi was bound, gagged, and shot eight times. Amina, Khaalis' daughter, was put in a closet and shot three times. She was told, \\"You know your father wrote those letters, don't you? Don't you know he can't do anything like that?\\" Unsure if she was dead, she was shot two more times, and then the gun jammed. Amina survived the shooting. Seven Philadelphia Black Muslims were charged for the crime. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was a pall bearer at the funeral for Khaalis' children.  The trials  H. Price, 23, Jerome Sinclair, 22, also known as Jerome 5X; John W. Griffin, 28, also known as Omar Jamal; John W. Clark, 31; Thomas Moody, 20; and William Christian, 29, were indicted. They all had extensive police records and, with the exception of Christian, they all had served prison sentences at Holmesburg Prison. Of the six defendants, one was acquitted when a key witness, Price, an unindicted co-conspirator, refused to testify. Price was not happy with the lifestyle afforded as a protected witness. Price also thought that if he could get out from the witness protection program he could reintegrate with his black Muslim brothers and they would stop threatening violence against him. Then Minister Louis Farrakhan on behalf of Elijah Muhammad, aired a threat during his radio broadcast: > Let this be a warning to the opponents of Muhammad.. Let this be a warning > to those of you who would be used as an instrument of a wicked government > against our rise. Be careful, because when the government is tired of using > you, they're going to dump you back into the laps of your people. And > although Elijah Muhammad is a merciful man and will say, \\"Come in,\\" and > forgive you, yet in the ranks of black people today there are younger men > and women rising up who have no forgiveness in them for traitors and stool > pigeons. And they will execute you as soon as your identity is known. Be > careful because nothing shall prevent the rise of the messiah, The Nation of > Islam, and the black man the world over. This broadcast led Price to refuse to testify. He was then murdered in Holmesburg prison, where he was housed with other Black Muslims. Another defendant was granted a retrial after the jury had found him guilty, which ended in a mistrial because Amina Khaalis, a survivor of the massacre and the daughter of the Hanafi leader, refused to be cross-examined as she had \\"suffered irreparable psychological trauma\\" and it was thought that it was \\"highly probable\\" that she would suffer psychiatric injury if she were to testify again about the murders. One of the men indicted, Ronald Harvey, was also indicted for the Camden, New Jersey murder of Major Coxson, a flamboyant black businessman and unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Camden.  Aftermath  In 1977, Hamaas Abdul Khaalis led an attack in Washington, DC, the 1977 Hanafi Siege. He said that the purpose of the siege was to bring attention to the murders of his wife, two children, and nine-day-old grandchild, and the shooting of his daughter. The murder brought attention to the armed conflict between Sunni Muslims and Nation of Islam Muslims. Sunni Muslims believe Nation of Islam Muslims changed the doctrines of Islam by excluding whites and by accepting Elijah Muhammad as a messenger of Allah. Sunnis believe that Islam is color-blind and that whites can become Muslim. They also believe that Muhammad was the last messenger of Allah.

An adiabatic quantum motor is a mechanical device, typically nanometric, driven by a flux of quantum particles and able to perform cyclic motions. The adjective ‚Äúadiabatic‚Äù in this context refers to the limit when the dynamics of the mechanical degrees of freedom is slow compared with the dwell time of the particles passing through the device. In this regime, it is commonly assumed that the mechanical degrees of freedom behave classically. This class of devices works essentially as quantum pumps operated in reverse. While in a quantum pump, the periodic movement of some parameters pumps quantum particles from one reservoir to another, in a quantum motor a DC current of particles induces the cyclic motion of the device. One key feature of these motors is that quantum interferences can be used to increase their efficiency by enhancing the reflection coefficient of the scattered particles. Although there are several proposals for the realization of adiabatic quantum motors, none of them have been verified experimentally.

It is also known as the sanddune sandbur, long-spine sandbur or sand-dune sandspur and is common in sandy, marshy, or loosely forested areas. It differs from C. spinifex in its larger spikelets and smaller number of spikelets per fascicle, and from C. longispinus in its densely pubescent fascicles, fewer bristles, and wider inner bristles. Distribution In the United States, the dune sandbur is native to Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana. In Hawaii it is an invasive plant. It is considered threatened in New York. It can also be found natively in Brazil, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. Habitat and ecology The dune sandbur is an annual plant that grows in dunes, in loose sands, in thin woods, and in the open. It exhibits a sprawling habitat where it can be found. It can be found along coastal states, from Mississippi to New York. Where it grows primarily in August and September. Morphology upright Individuals of this species grow in small, spiky pods. Flowers usually small but not numerous. Leaves are 2 ranked, internodes hollow. Plants tall or short, in spikelets bisexual and alike. Spikelets in hard burs bearing hard, stiff spines. 1-8 spikelets enclosed in a tiny bur, the spines minutely barbed downward near the tip. Parts of spines can break off under the skin and become quite painful. It is an annual plant, and easily recognized by the densely hairy cup-like burs that, including spines, are 10‚Äì15 mm wide. Burs usually have 15-43 spines, in spikelike racemes, with pedicels swollen. Leaf sheaths are inflated, and blades are usually folded. Flowers and fruit The spur of the dune sandbur act as its fruit. Reproduction occurs through epizoochory, by both waterborne transportation or by being dispersed by animals that the sandbur clings to. The spines appear to serve as deterrent to preserve the seeds from consumption and also contribute to their wind dispersal. They have barbs of various sizes and of mostly uniform shape spread uniformly over its surface. These barbs are more numerous near the surface of the spine. The interior tissue of the spine is made up of thick walled cells. Each barb contains a tube like air cavity which is filled with a light purple substance that, when the barb is broken off from the spine, can cause inflammation of the wound.

Nobles is a professor emeritus in the Department of Africana Studies at San Francisco State University and notable pioneer of the African-American psychology movement. Biography Nobles' grandparents were born into American slavery. His parents, Annie Mae Cotton and John Nobles, chose the name Wade, meaning \\"one who is able to tread through difficult matter like mud, snow or ignorance.\\" Nobles earned his PhD in psychology from Stanford University. He is married to Vera Lynn Winmilawe Nokwanda DeMoultrie (PhD), with whom Nobles has five children and 11 grandchildren. Nobles belongs to the If√° spiritual system. Academic career Nobles is the founder and executive director of the Institute for the Advanced Study of Black Family, Life and Culture, Inc. in Oakland, California, the only independent organization whose sole objective is the betterment of black family life and culture. The institute performs both social work and scientific research. Nobles was a founding member of the Association of Black Psychologists, where he served as national President from 1994 to 1995. An experimental social psychologist, Nobles focuses his research on such topics as African psychology, Black self- concept, African-American family dynamics, and African-centered education, healing, and spirituality. Nobles co-leads the ‚ÄúEnyimnyam Project,‚Äù created with the objective of connecting diasporic Africans with Africans from the continent. Publications Nobles has authored over 100 articles, research reports, chapters, and books, including African Psychology: Toward its Reclamation, Reascension and Revitalization, Seeking the Sakhu: Foundational Writings in African Psychology, and The Island of Memes: Haiti‚Äôs Unfinished Revolution. Island of Memes, inspired by Nobles' visit to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, focuses on the roles of Haitian religion and class systems in its recovery from natural disaster and uses memes as cultural indicators. Among Nobles' scientific publications is his article \\"Extended self: Rethinking the so-called Negro self-concept,\\" which critiques Euro-Americans' research about African Americans on the basis of their fundamental misunderstanding of group differences and misapplication of Euro-centric norms. Similarly, his article \\"Africanity: Its Role in Black Families\\" criticizes social science research defining the black family as disorganized and pathological, as it is performed by non-black researchers with negative assumptions of black family life.

The New York Mining Stock Exchange absorbed the members of the American Mining and Stock Exchange, which had been operating for around fifteen months, on July 26, 1877. History The American Mining and Stock Exchange began operations around May 1876. Around early 1877, there was an attempt to consolidate the New-York Open Gold and Stock Exchange with the American Mining and Stock Exchange, both of which were next door to one- another in New York. On June 8, 1877, the New York Times reported on another \\"shrewd\\" attempt to break up and dissolve the New-York Open Gold and Stock Exchange, and merge it with the American Mining and Stock Exchange. According to the committee proposals, the new exchange would be named The Consolidated Mining, Gold, and Stock Exchange of New-York.\\" At the time, however, the committees of both exchanges had not come to an agreement on merging. The matter was decided on June 8 at an executive session. Terms had been agreed on by June 14, 1877. L. W. Badger was appointed chairman. The New York Mining Stock Exchange returned to 60 Broadway on July 26, 1877, on which day it also absorbed the members of the American Mining and Stock Exchange.

The film's origins date back to 2006, when Nayar met Julius Arile and fellow former cattle rustler Robert Matanda at the Tegla Loroupe Peace Race, created to reduce tension among rival tribes in northern Kenya. Nayar initially did a short radio story on the two men, which was broadcast on CBC Radio, and then remained in contact. The film follows the men through over 10 years, through training and races, and documents how their lives diverge: Arile pursues a career in running as well as politics, acting as a Kenyan representative at the UN to speak out against the proliferation of illegal small arms, while Matanda becomes disenchanted. Matanda and his wife would die in a car accident in March 2016, leaving behind seven children, whom Arile, Nayar and others from his community have united to help care for. Reception Gun Runners had its world premiere in 2016 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, followed by a Canadian theatrical release in the fall of 2016, with screenings in a number of Canadian cities, including Toronto during the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon.

IRPD spectroscopy has been shown to use electron ionization, corona discharge, and electrospray ionization to obtain spectra of volatile and nonvolatile compounds. Ionized gases trapped in a mass spectrometer can be studied without the need of a solvent as in infrared spectroscopy. Schematic diagram of infrared photodissociation spectrometer History Scientists began to wonder about the energetic of cluster formation early in the 19th century. Henry Eyring developed the activated-complex theory describing kinetics of reactions. Interest in studying the weak interactions of molecules and ions(e.g. van der Waals) in clusters encouraged gas phase spectroscopy, in 1962 D.H. Rank studied weak interactions in the gas phase using traditional infrared spectroscopy. D.S. Bomse used IRPD with an ICR to study isotopic compounds in 1980 at California Institute of Technology. Spectroscopy for weak bonding clusters was limited by low cluster concentration and the variety of accessible cluster states. Cluster states vary in part due to frequent collisions with other species, to reduce collisions in gas phase IRPD forms clusters in low pressure ion traps (e.g. FT-ICR). Nitrogen and water were one of the first complexes studied with the aid of a mass spectrometer by A. Good at University of Alberta in the 1960s.  Instrumentation  Photodissociation is used to detect electromagnetic activity of ions, compounds, and clusters when spectroscopy cannot be directly applied. Low concentrations of analyte can be one inhibiting factor to spectroscopy esp. in the gas phase. Mass spectrometers, time-of-flight and ion cyclotron resonance have been used to study hydrated ion clusters. Instruments are able to use ESI to effectively form hydrated ion clusters. Laser ablation and corona discharge have also been used to form ion clusters. Complexes are directed through a mass spectrometer where they are irradiated with infrared light, Nd:YAG laser.  Application  Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy maintains a powerful capability to study bond energies of coordination complexes. IRPD can measure varying bond energies of compounds, including dative bonds and coordination energies of molecular clusters. Structural information about analytes can acquired by using mass selectivity and interpreting fragmentation. 287x287px  References  Infrared Mass spectrometry Chemical bond properties Spectroscopy ","title":"Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy"},{"id":"53443660","text":"Stijn van Gassel (born 17 October 1996) is a Dutch football player who plays for Helmond Sport.
