Signs and symptoms Many patients with unruptured IIA may have no symptoms. In patients who do have symptoms these are often related to rupture of the aneurysm and to its cause. Rupture of an IIA results in subarachnoid hemorrhage, symptoms of which include headache, dizziness, seizures, altered mental status and focal neurological deficits. In contrast to other cerebral aneurysms, large aneurysm size does not increase the chance of rupture. Small IIAs tend to have high rupture rates, while larger IIAs more commonly cause symptoms due to pressure on the surrounding brain tissue. Cause Most IIAs are caused by bacterial infection, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species. In most cases the infection originates from left-sided bacterial endocarditis. Other common sources include cavernous sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, poor dental hygiene and intravenous drug use. The use of the term infectious aneurysm by the above authors is incorrect. Refer to Holtzman RNN, Pile-Spellman JMD, Brust JCM, Hughes JEO, Dickinson PCT: Surgical Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Caussed by Infection, in: Schmidek HH and Roberts DW(eds): Schmidek & Sweet Operative Neurosurgical Techniques: Indications, Methods, and Results ed.5. Philadelphia: Elsevier Inc. 2006 Vol 1: Chap. 87, pp1223-1259 Diagnosis Diagnosis of IIA is based on finding an intracranial aneurysm on vascular imaging in the presence of predisposing infectious conditions. Positive bacterial cultures from blood or the infected aneurysm wall itself may confirm the diagnosis, however blood cultures are often negative. Other supporting findings include leukocytosis, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein in blood. =Terminology= The term mycotic aneurysm, initially attributed to Osler and used to describe bacterial intracranial aneurysms, is a misnomer. Most investigators currently agree that its use should be strictly limited to descriptions of aneurysms of fungal origin. Yet efforts to establish an accurate nomenclature have been generally unsuccessful. Therefore, we are resigned to the fact that the term mycotic aneurysm will remain in general parlance. At the same time, we prefer the use of a more specific and accurate heading, namely, infected intracranial aneurysm, to include the categories of intracranial bacterial aneurysm, fungal aneurysm, spirochetal aneurysm, infested or amebic aneurysm, viral aneurysm and phytotic aneurysm, according to the specific infecting organism or agent. The terms infectious aneurysm and infective aneurysm are flawed because they imply that the aneurysm itself is the infecting agent rather than being the end point of an infecting process. Until such a pathogenesis has been detected, it is the intention of the authors to avoid catachresis and the application of archaic language(Marcus S, The George Delacorte Professor of English and Comparative Literature, Columbia University, New York, personal communicationa, l993: \\" The correct usage is 'infected'. The term 'infectious' died out as a usage in termed of infected in l726.\\" And Jost, DA, Former Senior Lexicographer of The American Heritage Dictionary, Boston, personal communication, l996:\\"Infectious aneurysm will be interpreted by most users of English as an aneurysm that can communicate infection\\"). The term infected intracranial aneurysm lacks the properties of complete definition because it refers to the initial process that affects the arterial wall and to aneurysms found to have bacteria in their walls at the time of excision(Table 87-1, Patient 3; see Case Report 9, Fig. 87-9), but not to the processes of focal dilatation or subsequent aneurysm formation and enlargement. It also accurately describes the congenital or berry aneurysm that has become secondarily infected. The terms septic aneurysm and septic embolism and septic arteritis are also commonly used. However, the word septic refers to infection involving the blood stream and is not really descriptive of the aneurysm themselves. Treatment Treatment depends on whether the aneurysm is ruptured and may involve a combination of antimicrobial drugs, surgery and/or endovascular treatment. Prognosis Mortality of IIA is high, unruptured IIA are associated with a mortality reaching 30%, while ruptured IIA has a mortality of up to 80%. IIAs caused by fungal infections have a worse prognosis than those caused by bacterial infection. Epidemiology IIAs are uncommon, accounting for 2.6% to 6% of all intracranial aneurysms in autopsy studies.

Companies like Impact Water that have been financed by YSB tackle similar challenges to those traditionally addressed by aid agencies or charities, providing employment, education, healthcare, clean water and clean energy to over 3 million people worldwide. Founded in 2011, with headquarters in Frankfurt and Berlin, YSB's mission is to expand the social business model pioneered by Prof. Muhammad Yunus through the Yunus Center in Bangladesh, to countries throughout the developing world. The primary goal is to utilise the tools developed in the business world, to create financially self-sustaining companies dedicated to reducing poverty. A secondary goal is to finance social businesses that directly contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. YSB has supported over 3000 Entrepreneurs, completed a revenue of per year $13million of social business financing, helped create over 30,000 jobs and impacted the lives of over 3 million people in Colombia, Brasil, Haiti, The Balkans, Tunisia, India and Uganda.  Background  Founded in 2011 by Muhammad Yunus, Saskia Bruysten and Sophie Eisenmann, YSB's aim is to replicate the social business model, pioneered by Prof. Yunus, across the developing world. With a focus on providing financial and business support to social businesses outside of Bangladesh, the fund focuses on financing companies that either provide income or essential products and services to the poor.Muhammad (2011). Building Social Business: The New Kind of Capitalism that Serves Humanity's Most Pressing Needs. PublicAffairs. pp. 256. Yunus Social Business acts as the international implementation arm for Prof. Yunus's Social Business conceptYunus, Muhammad (2009). Creating a World Without Poverty: Social Business and the Future of Capitalism. PublicAffairs. pp. 320. . and operates under the same principles as the Social Businesses it finances, in particular, the social business model.  What YSB does  YSB currently operates in the following countries, Albania, Brazil, Colombia, Haiti, India, Tunisia and Uganda. Local country teams focus on identifying and sourcing networks, communities and individual social entrepreneurs or existing businesses built around a strong social mission. Promising social businesses that have the potential to scale quickly can then apply for either financing or an accelerator program, to help them prepare for investment. = The Accelerator Programs = YSB operates social business accelerator programs in a number of countries. The programs are designed to refine and test business models, establish early market traction and also define and measure social impact metrics. These short 1 to 3 month programs offer social entrepreneurs the opportunity to strengthen their business acumen through workshops, leadership training and access to international and local mentor networks. Businesses that join an accelerator program are typically at the prototype or early-revenue stage and need small but meaningful financial assistance to test their prototypes, increase their productivity and/or scale up production. = The Social Business Fund = High potential social entrepreneurs emerging from the accelerator program can apply for financing and business support. At the end of the Accelerator Program, entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to the YSB Investment Committee and selected social businesses may receive seed capital from their in-country Social Business Fund. Investment amounts range from €100,000 to €1,000,000. Financing is provided in incremental steps based on milestone and KPI achievements and as equity and long-term shareholder loans with below-market-conditions and tailored grace and repayment periods.  Country Initiatives  YSB is active in 8 countries with local offices in 7 including Albania, Brazil, Colombia, Haiti, India Tunisia and Uganda. Since 2011,YSB has deployed $12 million to 52 social businesses in 7 countries, supporting more than 1,000 entrepreneurs and having an impact on more than 2 million customers. = YSB Albania = YSB Albania began operations in April 2012 with the support of the Albanian National Government, and in 2014, it expanded its outreach to Kosovo. YSB Albania has financed 5 social businesses to date, and ran its first intense accelerator program in 2014. = YSB Brazil = In March 2013, YSB Brazil was launched to spread the social business concept throughout Brazil; Rio was officially declared a ‘Social Business City.’ Yunus Negocios Sociais Brasil, as it is locally known, ran three cycles of accelerator programs in São Paulo and Rio in 2014. = YSB Colombia = YSB Colombia was created in 2011 originally as Grameen Caldas and officially became YSB Colombia in 2013. It currently manages a portfolio of 3 social businesses to date, including a joint venture with potato giant McCain. = YSB Costa Rica = Launched the first corporate social business joint venture with a Costa Rican leading food company, Florida Ice and Farm Company, to produce food to combat malnutrition targeting children. = YSB Haiti = Based in Port-au-Prince, the YSB Haiti office was opened in 2010 with the support of our founding partner SAP. Currently, the team manages a portfolio of 9 social businesses. In 2013, YSB set up a new social business joint venture together with Virgin Unite and the Clinton Foundation – The Haiti Forest initiative. The main objectives of Haiti Forest are to engage the local community in re-foresting Haiti, provide sustainable livelihoods to farmers across Haiti, create job opportunities and create an affordable and clean fuel source to reduce dependency on charcoal. = YSB India = YSB India was launched in 2011 in Mumbai, and 7 social businesses have received financing to date. = YSB Tunisia = Launched in 2013 in partnership with the African Development Bank, Tunisia was the first in a series of African countries to replicate the social business concept. In 2014, it launched its first accelerator program, locally known as iBDA. = YSB Uganda = In partnership with the African Development Bank, YSB Uganda was started in November 2013, and the first social businesses were supported in 2014.

Despite this adversity, she was far more successful and influential than her metropolitan counterparts. Career In addition to portraits, she took images of the mounted police, ranching and wildflowers. She frequently accompanied her husband, John Douglas Moodie, on his travels, photographing the Innu people in the area of Hudson Bay (1904–1909).

Running from Crazy is a 2013 television documentary film by director Barbara Kopple about the family of Mariel Hemingway, grand daughter of Nobel Prize-winning author Ernest Hemingway. Through the eyes of Mariel, who received an Oscar nomination for her role in Woody Allen's 1979 film Manhattan, and who has spoken for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, it chronicles the story of three of the author's grandchildren; Mariel, Margaux Hemingway and Joan \\"Muffet\\" Hemingway, daughters of Jack Hemingway, and their struggles with the family history of substance abuse, mental illness and suicide. First shown at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, the documentary was promoted on the Oprah Winfrey Network, which aired its premiere on April 27, 2014. Synopsis Mariel comments early in the film on the fact that seven family members have committed suicide, including Ernest and Margaux. Ernest shot himself a few months before his granddaughter Mariel was born. The film includes excerpts from lengthy footage filmed by Margaux in 1983, called by a reviewer the \\"most riveting depictions of the Hemingway clan\\". It demonstrates the contrast between the two sisters: Margaux's modeling and acting career ultimately collapsed, and in 1996 she died of a drug overdose just days before the 35th anniversary of her grandfather's suicide, while Mariel's early career was successful. In the documentary, Mariel describes her own experience with depression and thoughts of suicide, which she says she has overcome, and talks of her difficulties in dealing with sometimes abusive family members, and with the mental illness of her sister Muffet, diagnosed with \\"bipolar schizophrenia\\". Reception A reviewer called the film \\"one of the bleakest snapshots of the human soul at this year's [Sundance] festival\\".

His father was a painterGiancarlo Francesconi, by E. Tadini, Milano, Salone Annunciata, 1959 who edited Il Corriere dei piccoli and conceived Il Corriere dei ragazzi,Sergio Badino, Conversazione con Carlo Chendi. Da Pepito alla Disney e oltre: cinquant'anni di fumetto vissuti da protagonista, Tenué 2006 while his mother, an advertiser, created a number of famous advertising campaigns. Francesconi spent his early years in QT8, a working class quarter in Milan that rose up alongside a huge pile of post-war rubble which would later become Monte Stella. At the age of five, won over by a concert by Svjatoslav Richter, he began to learn the piano. Although he was accepted into the junior high school section of the city's conservatory six years later, he instinctively pulled out, thinking that it was too academic and conventional. Instead, even though he had in the meantime moved with his family to a more central quarter of Milan, Francesconi opted to attend the junior high school in QT8. In this way from a very early age his relationship with music and life in general took on a course of responsibility and constant choice, of research and direct experimentation.  Education  We need to profoundly rethink and filter in a determined way the enormously rich potential that has been elaborated in the past and to use it for expressive purposes.Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA. La loi musicale – Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (dés)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000 Francesconi returned to the Conservatory of Milan in 1974, while he was still attending the Berchet Classical Languages High School, and explored the length and breadth of the musical landscape, taking an interest in every possible dimension of sound.Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - Appendix VII (2007) He played in jazz and rock groups as well as in classical concerts, he worked as a session man in recording studios, and he composed music for theatre, cinema, advertising, and television. These were all rewarding experiences, not least from an economic point of view, but they were not enough. He realised that a truly living language, while looking at the present, draws its lifeblood from its roots. The time had come for him to dig into the tradition of music to which he belonged. The Milan Conservatory was opening more and more space to contemporary music so Francesconi enrolled in the composition course conducted by Azio Corghi. \\"From him I learnt the trade, the fundamentals, counterpoint and those things, professional seriousness and open-mindedness.\\"Ricciarda Belgiojoso, \\"Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi\\", Postmedia Books, 2013 In the meantime he continued to explore electronic music and in 1977 took time out to immerse himself in jazz at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. = A student of Karlheinz Stockhausen= The mountain is in front of us and it is necessary to pass over it, with enormous force and patience. It's not enough just to contemplate it nor to sneak by it via secondary paths much less go backwards claiming that the mountain is not there.Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA. La loi musicale – Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (dés)apprend, édited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000 Donnerstag aus Licht went on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan in 1981. Stockhausen is a historical reference point: Francesconi admired him for his extraordinary organisational consistency, for his tireless search for a linguistic unity. He was also deeply struck by the visionary quality of this initial opera. He wanted to observe the composer at work so he enrolled in the intensive course that Stockhausen held in Rome that same year. \\"From him I learnt rigor, at first imbibing it by osmosis, and then demythologising it.\\"Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia Books, 2013[7] = Meeting and collaboration with Luciano Berio = Luciano didn't talk much about the more 'technical' and delicate aspects of his work as a composer. I remember that when he least expected it, I would fire questions at him point blank, hoping to pick up some tips. His replies were like enigmas. They had something sacral about them and they required divining rituals to decode them.Luca Francesconi, Per Luciano, Centro studi Luciano Berio, www.lucianoberio.org With Berio Francesconi studied above all in the field, just like the workshop artisans of old, acting as his assistant from 1981 to 1984. He worked directly on the score of La vera storia and participated in the production as rehearsal pianist and second conductor/substitute maestro. In 1984 he collaborated with the composer in the rewriting of Monteverdi's Orfeo. He was also present with Berio at Tanglewood where he attended one of his famous summer courses.  Activities, works, research  In 1984 three of Francesconi's pieces, including Passacaglia, for large orchestra (1982), were selected for the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in Amsterdam. This first important recognition on the international scene created a useful tie with the Dutch music scene and laid the foundation for further commissions. Meanwhile, in Italy, thanks to a commission from the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Francesconi had the opportunity to seriously put into practice for the first time his idea of a \\"polyphony of languages\\": Suite 1984. The polyphony that I have in mind hasn't got anything to do with the \\"postmodern\\" or collage, the exotic pastiche, the provincial chinoiserie of our grandparents (but also of Stockhausen and certain pop groups). Instead, it is a free fusion of ideas in a compact and linguistically very solid body that reveals its profound energies in its inner profundity and not in an exterior heterogeneity. Energies that come from the earth, from popular culture, from ancient African and Oriental cultures.Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in AA.VV. La loi musicale – Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (dés)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000 \\"In 1984 the Teatro Lirico in Cagliari presented a quartet made up of the pianist and composer Franco D'Andrea together with the group Africa Djolé led by the master percussionist Fode Youla from Guinea. The idea was then conceived that the music of this group be recreated in symphonic form (Suite 1984) by the 28 year-old Luca Francesconi for a performance by the theatre's orchestra under the direction of Francesconi himself, a recent product of rigorous musical studies, assistant to Luciano Berio and 'jazz student of D'Andrea', as he used to like to define himself. The concert attracted experts from all over the place anxious to hear novelties and promising syncretisms of various musical civilisations, and it was a triumph.\\"Franco Fayenz, Si chiude la ribalta della Scala per Quartett, antologia di soluzioni geniali, Il Sole 24 ore, May 8th 2011 \\"Orchestra, African percussionists and jazz quintet: the choice of instrumental make-up itself contained in an explicit manner the generative nucleus of one of the principal aesthetic motors of the music of Luca Francesconi: the tendency to place alongside one another, following the rules of contrast and fusion, sounds and languages of highly diverse origins.\\"Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani- VII Appendix (2007) = 1984-1990 = Francesconi's first record, an LP recorded in the United States, contained Viaggiatore insonne, on a text by Sandro Penna. \\"Francesconi's attitude as a composer is in fact similar to that of a tireless traveller, who explores linguistic spaces in search of their ever shifting confines, and who conducts an etiological study to determine the confines between noise and sound, between instinct and reason.\\"Robert Coheur, A fuoco, 4° studio sulla memoria, www.modernmusix.com The new piece Vertige, for string orchestra, was performed in Strasbourg. Francesconi composed various works for ensemble which were performed in Cagliari (Onda sonante, for eight instruments, commissioned by the Nieuw Ensemble; conductor: Ed Spanjaard (1985)), Paris (Tracce, for flute (1986)), Città di Castello (Da capo, for nine instruments (1988)), Middelburg (Finta-di-nulla, for soprano and nineteen instruments on a text by Umberto Fiori; Xenakis Ensemble; conductor: Diego Masson; and soprano: Marie Duisit (1991)), and Brussels (Encore/Da capo, for 9 instruments; Ictus Ensemble, conducted by the composer (1995)). In 1984 Casa Ricordi became Francesconi's publisher and since then has published all his works. In 1985 he was invited to the Festival Musica ‘900 in Trent for a series of public conversations with Franco Donatoni. This meeting proved extremely important; talking with the great Verona composer, both in their public conversations and during train trips together, Francesconi felt that he reached a solution for a number of unresolved problems. Plot in fiction, dedicated to Franco Donatoni, was in many ways the happy outcome of this experience. = Plot in Fiction = The really difficult thing is to write works with a rich and articulated complex of meanings and events: works, that is, that are capable of assuming a linguistic structure, of being a world (Mahler!), but whose complexity is transparent. Plot in Fiction, for oboe and cor anglais or clarinet and chamber group (1986), constructs its sonoric line around key notes within a rigorous formal framework.Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia italiana Treccani, VII Appendix, 2007 \\"The point here is to find the \\"plot\\" in the \\"fiction\\", the narrative line that twists and turns through the complexity and intricacy of a \\"mass of everyday symbols\\".Christopher Thomas, Metier, msvcd 92018, www.divineartrecords.com What's involved is an architecture that guides the listener within the composition: the search for a compositional transparency (without, however, ever slipping into simplicity; the means employed leave unaltered the quality of the composer's thought), based on pure energy, directly perceptible, without any need to exhibit the mechanisms underlying it. The piece was performed for the first time at the Festival Musica '900 in Trent by Ensemble Musique Oblique under the direction of Sandro Gorli; the soloist was Diego Dini Ciacci. = Mambo = At this point I would say that it is no longer possible to talk of a language devoid of code or morphogenesis, i.e. of a language that comes into being while the aesthetic event is being produced. It's necessary to also come to terms with a substratum, with what I call semantic pressure, that is with history.Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia books, 2013 Mambo, for solo piano, is Francesconi's most jazz-like piece, and it reveals clearly his search for an ever uneasy equilibrium between sonoric materials, gathered in their primitive state, and the evocative power of history, from which the composer cannot remove himself. In the piece there is an overlap of a rhythmic ostinato in a low register, a series of ascending-descending diatonic lines, and, finally, a sequence of pounding 4-note chords. In this continual 'friction of contraries' resides the aesthetic motor of Francesconi's music as well as the powerful charge of sonoric seduction that his works carry. Francesconi exploits as a precious resource the capacity for intense analysis developed in Western culture. He takes a shared musical reference and dissects it remorselessly until he lays bare further possibilities of development, of transformation. Wielding its 'semantic pressure' as though it were a picklock, he presses further and further inwards, towards the energy-bearing roots of sound. = AGON, centre for music research and experimentation = It's important for composers to confront the use of computers face-on; even empirically, at a basic level. To search for, study, and promote new means through which to communicate with them, new interfaces. It's important for them to help to lead mankind back to the centre of his machines.Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, Milano 1994 In 1990 Francesconi founded AGON with two great utopian visions in mind. The first was that it is still possible and desperately important to work together, cooperatively, imagining projects to realise together with others, to exchange experiences, ideas. AGON came into being as an organism with a public identity: \\"it is not my or your studio\\"; it aspires to be a place where it's possible to talk, meet, and not just pursue one's own interest. The second utopian idea was to start from below and not from high-tech; to depart from the musical needs of composers with a view to stimulating a different relationship, simpler, \\"less terroristic\\", between real musicians and machines. Handling electronics also serves, according to Francesconi, to recuperate a physical, auditive approach to musical composition, which, if limited to paper and pencil, runs the risk of becoming too speculative, weakening the direct relationship with the sonoric material.Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - VII Appendice (2007) AGON has for many years been one of the most active centres in Italy for music research and production. = Riti neurali = Complexity is always a question of quality, not quantity. What really matters is transparency in an overall density. This means that I should only make use of a particularly articulated syntax if I really need to, or, in other words, only if I've got particularly articulated things to say.Luca Francesconi, Complessità, Milan 1989 Composed in 1991, for violin and eight instruments, Riti neurali is Francesconi's third study on memory. Like many of his works, it develops the material on multiple levels, pursuing labyrinthine paths. Nonetheless, its clearly delineated textures offer the listener unmistakable points of reference.Beth E. Levy, Furious Craft, 8 December 2008, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Forum, Music program, San Francisco Contemporary Music Players The soloist establishes a vast array of relations with the small orchestra (guiding it, allowing himself to be guided, contradicting it, ignoring it, etc.), at the same time assuming various positions himself ... The complexity of the counterpoint arises out of the simultaneity of the various positions. \\"There are things that evoke other things, or that acquire meaning in relation to other things. We are subjected, in a certain sense, to a historically determined perceptive destiny. Whether we want to be or not. The illusion of the tabula rasa, of pure transparency, is not enough. Probably it's better to take account of this perceptive problem right from the start and to consider it one of the compositional parameters.\\" The work was commissioned by Radio France and the world premiere took place in Paris on 14 January 1992: Asko Ensemble; conductor: Denis Cohen, and soloist: Irvine Arditti. While a series of performances followed on from one another in Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, and Antwerp, an extensive portrait at the Venice Biennale, in 1993, definitively consolidated Francescon's reputation in Italy as well: the Nieuw Ensemble Amsterdam, Arditti and Ensemble Modern (with the newly commissioned Plot II) joined forces in a single concert dedicated to the composer's music at the Teatro La Fenice. = Etymo = The great challenge is to maintain in the composer the two levels, the compositional and the emotive, and to ensure that these continually charge each other with responsibility for the form of the work up until in the end they arrive at a balanced result.Massimiliano Viel, Incontro con Luca Francesconi: Il calcolo e l'intuizione. L'elettronica come sfida, in Sonus, Materiali per la musica contemporanea, issue n.11, December 1993 Between 1993 and 1994 Francesconi worked and taught in Paris in the hyper-technological workshop Ircam, where \\"you model sound with your hands\\". On commission from Ircam, he carried out computer analysis on sounds and their behaviour right down to their roots, their etymon, to realise \\"one of the most convincing and at the same time impetuous musical equivalents of the writing of Baudelaire, striving with clarity of mind to achieve a secure control over the insidious relationship between words and music.\\"David Osmonde Smith, 'Un no man's land fertile: Francesconi et le théâtre musical', in Musica program for Luca Francesconi, Ballata, Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels, October 2002. The piece is based almost entirely on Baudelaire's poem Le Voyage, of which at two points we hear the soprano declaim two key fragments: \\"Dites, qu'avez-vous vu?\\" (Speak, what have you seen?). The computer analysis of this question constitutes the DNA that structures the entire piece, from the microstructure to the macroform. The result is a multi-levelled organism that in 25 minutes lays out its basic material (phonemes, instrumental particles, electronic transformation) and then proceeds to join it all together in increasingly complex structures. Everything begins with a question on the origin of meaning (in Greek: \\"etymon\\"). What is there before the word, and what models language? And finally, what allows us to transcend language? In the beginning there is pre- language, its premises. Etymo, a work furnished with huge white wings, starts out with the primordial mumblings of language, in phonemes. Nothing is intelligible, alliterations that roll off and slip away (or fluctuate) and an orchestra that appears suspended, as if it were waiting. These phonetic and musical particles aggregate in a contrapuntal overlapping which in the end explodes in an ocean of profundity from which the first words arise. An important example of how Francesconi employs electronics in a masterly way to broaden the expressive range and colour of instruments. The physicality of the performance remains at the centre of the work, but the electronics helps it to reach an extreme expressive intensity.Hubert Culot, Music Web International, Review of Etymo, Da capo, A fuoco, Animus, Kairos A fuoco (1995) is Francesconi's fourth study on memory; Animus, for trombone and computer (1996), was performed in Paris, while the London Sinfonietta took Plot in fiction to Santa Cecilia in Rome (1996). = Wanderer = The effort to formalise creative thought and thought as a whole is extremely important for composers as well, but by the same token the \\"analogical\\" and qualitative approach of the artist helps to play down their relationship with technological instruments and above all to reaffirm the impossibility of discretising, quantifying human experience; the impossibility of converting into binary code and sending via fibre optic cable the sum total of existence, the totality of aesthetic experience, of the body, of affection, of the world.Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, MIlan 1994 On 17 January 2000 Riccardo Muti conducted Wanderer at the Scala in Milan. \\"This voyager is man who, after conducting an inventory of the generations that have preceded him, takes with him only the bare essentials to set out on a path towards the immensity of possible spaces. At the dawn of the new millennium Luca Francesconi frees himself from the crushing weight of tradition, especially that generated by serialism and its worshipers. After extensive research into tempo, into tempi, one might say, into sonoric texture, the composer here explores a type of language that favours narration.Wanderer - Cobalt, Scarlet : two colours of dawn, http://www.lamediatheque.be/travers_sons/0103ag01.html = Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colours of Dawn = Music is closer than any other form of expression to that nucleus of \\"existential energy\\" that lives deep within us. 2000 was also the year of Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colors of Dawn. \\"A single movement of twenty three minutes for large orchestra divided into parallel - at times counterpoised – groups begins with a pianissimo of metallic gleams that emanate alternately from the two sides of the stage. Then, other percussion instruments, wind instruments and brass instruments, join in in a subdued manner, developing, transforming planes of volume and colour. But it is an unexpected metallic accent exploding like a burst of profundity that fills the auditorium not so much with clamour as with presence, rapture.\\"Chris Pasles, Old works and new shine equally bright, Los Angeles Times, November 22nd 2003 \\"With this composition Luca Francesconi reached a turning point in his career, enriching his exploration into the heart of sonoric material with greater sensibility and emotivity. In this way his music acceded to a broader artistic dimension, that of a harmonious encounter of technique and psychology in the broadest sense of the term.  Music theatre  From 1985 to the present Luca Francesconi has composed eight works of a theatrical stamp, from Scene, on a text by Umberto Fiori, to the chamber opera In Ostaggio, from Lips, Eyes Bang, for actress/singer, twelve instruments and live audio/video, to the video-opera Striaz. Ballata, commissioned by the Théâtre de La Monnaie in Brussels/di Bruxelles and with stage direction by Achim Freyer, was staged in 2002. = Ballata = My idea was to turn over a new leaf, to free myself so to speak from the 20th century. I wanted to use all the expressive densities that that century conceded to me, and for me it was a kind of synthesis of the musical experiences that had struck me most. In 1994 Luca Francesconi had realised an opera for radio (and eventual winner of the Prix Italia), Ballata del rovescio del mondo, on a text by Umberto Fiori; in 1996 his continuing, close collaboration with the Milan poet resulted in his third work for music theatre, Ballata, drawn from Samuel Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Divided into two acts, Ballata makes use of a large orchestra with an enlarged percussion section; on the right of the stage is an instrumental ensemble inspired by Gypsy orchestras, while four female choirs distributed at the four angles of the auditorium \\"function as walls that open and close towards the irrational, memory, towards flashbacks\\". Electronic sounds elaborated at IrcamAnne Genette, Ballata, www.lamediatheque. contribute to the spatial disorientation. Originally, for the role of the ancient mariner, Francesconi had thought of Sting, with whom he had recorded the first song of the opera Day After Day. In the end, however, the collaboration did not eventuate for reasons of language (Sting did not feel up to singing and acting in Italian), but the idea remained of a present-day narrator who, like the ancient mariner, is condemned to wander around the globe in search of someone to whom to recount his incredible adventures, from shipwreck to the glaciers of the South Pole, from the scorching sun of the equator to the appearance of monsters and a phantomatic sailing ship. The temporal plane is split: on stage the ancient mariner tells his story and at the same time he appears as a young man in the midst of a storm. Various compositional techniques follow on from one another, from early expressionism onwards, integrated with other traditions, like folk music. \\"Luca Francesconi develops an orchestral writing that is inventive, sensual and seductive all at the same time, deftly integrating electronic resources elaborated by Ircam. But, much more, he makes masterful use of an armoury of ardent vocality that is seasoned but anything but worn-out – from Brecht's spoken song to Monteverdi's madrigal, passing from the songs of English Baroque opera to all the immortals of Italian lyric opera, from Verdi to Berio, of whom he was a student.\\"Marie-Aude Roux, Ballata, drame syncretique de Francesconi, Le Monde, November 14th, 2002 = Buffa opera = Who said that music today necessarily has to create angst? It's enough to think that Albanese used to come running onto the stage pursued by a cigarette two and half metres tall. Buffa opera, a piece inspired by opera buffa on a text by Stefano Benni, went on stage at the Piccolo Teatro di Milano in 2002. It featured Antonio Albanese on stage for the whole opera as actor/singer alongside the chorus and the Buffa orchestra, a fully-fledged character, conducted by the composer himself. In it, the world was seen from the perspective of insects and spiders; Benni's libretto used surrealistic metaphors. Francesconi, who had been known for more dramatic or tragic work, composed music that employed a wide variety of styles, including jazz, avant- garde, and canzonetta, in a parodic manner. Buffa opera was later revived at the Teatro Morlacchi in Perugia.Anna Bandettini, L'umanità salvata da uno scarafaggio, Repubblica, May 11th 2002Enrico Girardi, Musica buffa per insetti, Corriere della sera, May 22nd 2002 Commissioned by the Holland Festival, Gesualdo Considered as a Murderer, on a libretto by Vittorio Sermonti, was performed for the first time in Amsterdam in June 2004. It was directed by Giorgio Barberio Corsetti, with Davide Damiani as Gesualdo, Eberhard Franscesco Lorenz as his Iago-like servant, and Alda Caiello as Gesualdo's wife's maid, and was well-received as a mature dramatic piece.Andrew Clements, Gesualdo Considered as a Murder, The Guardian, Friday 11 June 2004 Quartett in Buenos Aires, Colón Theater, June 2015 = Quartett = In 2011, Francesconi's eighth music theatre work, Quartett, premiered at the Scala in Milan. An adaptation of a text by Heiner Müller drawn in its turn from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's 1782 novel Les liaisons dangereuses, it was jointly commissioned by Teatro alla Scala, Wiener Festwochen and Ircam. The libretto, by the composer, is in English, a language whose syncretism Francesconi felt aligned with his taste in musical syncretism. The composer and reviewers described it as a cynical and violent work, whose only two characters are a man and a woman, with some sort of past together, in a room.Quartett - interview to Luca Francesconi, Teatro alla Scala, Season 2010/2011Tom Service, Luca Francesconi: do you dare go to his opera?, The Guardian, 19 June 2014 The opera has a single act, thirteen scenes, and lasts a total of an hour and twenty minutes. Only two characters on stage, a small orchestra in the orchestra pit, a large orchestra and choir off-stage (available as a recording effected at the Scala in Milan), and electronics (Studio Ircam, Serge Lemouton: live and pre-recorded sounds). The stage direction at the Scala was entrusted to Alex Olle of La Fura dels Baus, who concentrated the action in a huge box suspended twelve metres above the stage, projecting onto the full breadth of the backdrop videos representing the outside world. Allison Cook, mezzo-soprano, interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil, alternating with Sinead Mulhern; Robin Adams, baritone, was Vicomte de Valmont. The conductor was Susanna Mälkki. This production was revived in 2012 in Vienna (Wiener FestWochen: conductor: Peter Rundel), in 2013 at the Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam (the opening of the Holland Festival; conductor: Susanna Mälkki) and at the Opera di Lille (Ensemble Ictus: conductor: Georges-Elie Octors), and in 2014 in Lisbon (Gulbenkian Foundation: conductor: Susanna Mälkki). Quartett was performed in concert form at the Cité de la Musique in Paris by Ensemble Intercontemporain (March 2013). A first new production was staged in Porto and Strasburg, once again with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, and with Remix Ensemble under the direction of Brad Lubman. The stage direction, scenery and costumes were by Nuno Carinhas and the lighting by Nuno Meira (Casa da Musica in Porto on 24 September 2013 and Festival Musica in Strasburg on 28 September 2013). The opera was produced again in London by the Royal Opera House in a coproduction with the Opéra di Rouen and the London Sinfonietta, from 18 to 28 June 2014, with stage direction by John Fulljames. Two casts alternated for the ten performances (Leigh Melrose and Kristin Chávez; and Mark Stone and Angelica Voje) on the metallic structures of a post-atomic bunker realised by Soutra Gilmour, with lighting by Bruno Poet and videos by Ravi Deepres projected onto tattered screens dropped from above in the restrained atmosphere of the Linbury Studio. Under the structures warm and dim lights lit up the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Andrew Gourlay. In 2015 the Malmö Opera presented a fourth production. It was directed by Stefan Johansson, with scenery by Jan Lundberg. Kirstin Chavez interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil and Christian Miedl Vicomte de Valmont; the conductor was Ralf Kircher. The La Fura del Baus production was performed again in Buenos Aires, Colón Theater, in June 2015, with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, director Alex Olle, conductor Brad Lubman. \\"The press wasn't indifferent at all: \\"La Fura dels Baus strikes in America as well\\" (El País); \\"An high voltage opera\\" (Clarín); \\"To the limits of the opera\\" (La Nación); \\"Portrait of a crippled bourgeoisie\\" (Página 12). \\"Quartett: a wonderful and yet very demanding opera\\" (Ámbito Financiero).Alexander Destuet, Quartett de Luca Francesconi: la Fura dels Baus ataca otra vez, La Vanguardia July 3rd 2015  The Venice Biennale  Today's semantic dictionary can put us in contact with other cultures, embolden us to recuperate magmatic sonorities. The Tarantola del Salento, the songs of Sardinia, African polyphonies. Ethnic music can open deep landscapes of the soul, obscure regions, forgotten loci of consciousness. It's necessary to be courageous, and, like Tarkovsky's Stalker, venture to where ferocious energies lie, in their primitive state. Not \\"stravaganti\\" (strange) but \\"extra vagans\\" (wandering beyond) towards the incandescent core of originsGiuseppina Manin, La musica è finita, Corriere della sera, September 16th 2008 From 2008 to 2011 Francesconi was the artistic director of the Venice Music Biennale. His imprint was immediately recognisable in the themes of the four festivals (\\"Roots/Future\\", \\"The body of sound\\", \\"Don Giovanni and the man of stone\\" and \\"Mutants\\") and it broadened out further in the conception of the festival as the ideal place \\"to seek new and different forms of perception and attention.\\"Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 30th 2010 Beyond the confines of concert halls and theatres, listeners freely chose how to approach the music, which was disseminated through the city as though on a stage in movement, accessible and without limits. This was the basic idea behind Exit, the celebratory evening/night that brought each of the four festivals to a close, transforming the Teatro alle Tese into a distended human body (Exit 02), \\"an experience with variable geometry, a new way of living space, sound and time from sunset to dawn\\",Giacomo Botteri, La ricerca dei valori e delle idealità perdute, domenica 19 ottobre 2008, www.nonsolocinema.it or inviting the public to take a boat towards the Island of San Michele to pay homage to Stravinsky in the form of three clarinet pieces at his tomb and to then participate in a banquet that evoked the finale of Don Giovanni. Don Giovanni was also at the heart of one of the most famous experiments in this four-year period: \\"Palazzo Pisani, home of the B. Marcello Conservatory, is the site chosen for the staging of Don Giovanni a Venezia, conceived by Francesconi himself. For this initiative, which has been defined as an opera-labyrinth, the public is asked not just to exercise its sensibility but also its intelligence, so as to try to create a kind of gap between space and time in which music can be inserted. After scrapping the old structure of the concert, Francesconi borrows three key scenes from Mozart's original – the duel between Don Giovanni and the Commendatore, the seduction of Zerlina and the death of Don Giovanni – and puts them on stage cyclically, in three different locations within the ancient Venetian palace, inserting in the loggie, palace rooms and courtyards another eight original pieces commissioned from contemporary composers. The spectator, as if he were to enter into a huge gallery and to decide autonomously how and what to look at, will have before his eyes a plurality of musical, scenic, theatrical and visual events to combine, putting aside the perceptive habits of space and time.\\"Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 16th 2010  Teaching  Luca Francesconi has taught for twenty five years in Italy's conservatories and at the University of Ohio, in Rotterdam and in Strasburg. He has held master classes throughout Europe and the world, from Japan to the United States, from China to Canada. Until 2019 he has taught composition at the Malmö Academy of Music (part of Lund University), where he directed the composition department.  Other collaborations  2000 marked two other important experiences. The Piccolo Teatro in Milan commissioned him to write the music for Calderón de la Barca's pièce La vida es sueño, with stage direction by Luca Ronconi, who in that very year took over the direction of the theatre from Giorgio Strehler. He wrote the music for Paolo Rosa's film Il mnemonista, produced by Studio Azzurro.  2014  Two important international symphonic commissions mark the year. = Duende. The Dark Notes = A dangerous descent into the infernal depths of the dark notes, to rediscover a primordial force in perhaps the most history-laden instrument of the West.Attilio Piovano, ‘Duende, the Dark Notes‘ di Luca Francesconi in prima a Torino, Il corriere musicale, May 3rd 2014 Written for the extraordinary soloist Leila Josefowicz, this concerto for violin and orchestra was jointly commissioned by SR Swedish Radio and the BBC Proms. Performed in Stockholm in February 2014, in Turin in May 2014 and in June 2015 for the BBC Proms. «It was well worth the wait. As the title suggests, Francesconi's concerto takes the idea of the Duende, the dark, demonic spirit of flamenco, as its starting point, but the music never seems simplistically pictorial or programmatic. Instead, with the violin as protagonist, the five movements (the last two merged seamlessly together) evoke a threatening world of extremes, of heightened emotions and dramatically contrasted colours and registers. The orchestra weaves febrile webs around solo writing whose cracked arpeggios and steep scales manage to be more or less traditionally virtuosic within musical contexts that are anything but conventional, especially in the ferocious cadenza at the heart of the final movement. Josefowicz's playing was immensely committed and astoundingly vivid, and it emerged in even sharper, more subtle focus in the Radio 3 recording, which also resolved many of the textures that had seemed rather blurred in the hall.»Andrew Clements, Prom 13: BBCSO/Mälkki/Josefowicz review – committed and astoundingly vivid, The Guardian, July 28th 2015 Duende was ranked number 6 in the Guardian's list of the top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015 = Dentro non ha tempo = \\"Curious, that title, 'Dentro non ha tempo'. It can be read in three ways: as the temporal suspension that someone who dies leaves in those that have loved him/her. As a reference to the great musical tradition from which Luciana came, the Abbado family: a homage to the past that has no time. Finally, an allusion to the form of the composition, based on three bars of Mozart's Don Giovanni dilated 29 times. Like the year of Luciana's birth, 1929.Giuseppina Manin, Le mie note sospese per Luciana Abbado, Corriere della Sera, June 12th 2014 Commissioned by the Teatro alla Scala for the Strauss cycle, Dentro non ha tempo, for large orchestra, is dedicated to Luciana Abbado Pestalozza, Francesconi's deceased friend who, with her sensibility and organisational capacity, played a crucial role in the development of contemporary music in Italy. The piece was performed at the Scala on 14 June 2014 under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.  2015 = Vertical Invader = Vertical Invader, concerto grosso for reed quintet and orchestra. On May 23 world premiere in Amsterdam, Concertgebouw, Calefax Reed Quintet: Oliver Boekhoorn (oboe), Ivar Berix (clarinet), Raaf Hekkema (saxophone), Jelte Althuis (bass clarinet) and Alban Wesly (bassoon). Radio Filharmonisch Orkest, conductor Osmo Vänskä. The 'vertical invader' to which the title refers is a metaphor for a connection that is true and profoundly desired - as opposed to the false relationships presented by mass media - a synchronicity that in music is as perennially elusive as it is in the world. = Macchine in echo = On October 2, the WDR Sinfonieorchester Cologne performed the world premiere of Luca Francesconi's Macchine in Echo at the Philharmonie in Cologne under the direction of Peter Rundel in collaboration with the piano duo GrauSchumacher. The piece was commissioned by the WDR, the Strasbourg MUSICA festival, and Wiener Konzerthaus. (The Strasbourg MUSICA festival presented the French premiere on 3 October at the closing concert of the festival's 33rd edition.) \\"When two pianos are involved, we can imagine them as two, frighteningly powerful, fiendish machines. With this piece, in addition to the two pianos, there's also a symphonic orchestra: I love the play of mirrors and the spell- binding multiplications of two pianos in unison with an orchestra. It's an infinite source of meanings: meanings that I need to find, in spite of the destructuration of reality all around us. In a small gesture towards this powerful resistance, I have incorporated a brief homage to Luciano Berio's Concerto for Two Pianos, one of the pieces that have left a profound mark on my life.\\" = Bread, water and salt = On October 3 at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, Sir Antonio Pappano together with the soprano Pumeza Matshikiza and the Orchestra and Choir of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, performed the world premiere of Bread, Water and Salt on texts by Nelson Mandela. This piece by Francesconi has been chosen to inaugurate the Orchestra di Santa Cecilia's 2015-16 concert season and will be dedicated by the orchestra to Ludwig van Beethoven. Francesconi says: \\"This piece was planned together with the 9th Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven, in order to create a link between the brotherhood idea of Beethoven and Schiller and what it may mean today. We've chosen Mandela because of his simple adherence to the spirituality of the body, of the bread, of the sofference that can be defeated. Of the goodness, that may seem a worn out common place to us, but for the people who have nothing left, not even dignity, it is the part of the human being that may save them, that may save us. It may defeat the cold cynicism that perverts our relationships. So here comes the brotherhood: all these words, despised in politics and in the media, may really lead us to happiness\\".

Tasquinimod has been mostly studied in prostate cancer, but its mechanism of action suggests that it could be used to treat other cancers. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), formerly called hormone-resistant or hormone-refractory prostate cancer, is prostate cancer that grows despite medical or surgical androgen deprivation therapy. Tasquinimod targets the tumor microenvironment and counteracts cancer development by inhibiting angiogenesis and metastasis and by modulating the immune system. It is now in phase III development, following successful phase II trial outcomes.  History  Collaborative studies by laboratories at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Active Biotech Research AB identified tasquinimod as the lead agent for developing a treatment for prostate cancer. Tasquinimod was one of several second-generation quinoline-3-carboxamide variants synthesized using the drug roquinimex as a starting point, and it performed well in pre-clinical studies of cancer models. In April 2011, Ipsen and Active Biotech entered into a broad partnership for the co-development of tasquinimod for the treatment of cancer. Active Biotech granted Ipsen exclusive rights to commercialize tasquinimod worldwide, except in North and South America and Japan where Active Biotech retained all commercial and marketing rights.  Mechanism of action  Tasquinimod is a novel small- molecule inhibitor that targets the tumor microenvironment by controlling the accumulation and immunosuppressive, pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic functions of regulatory myeloid cells (also called myeloid-derived suppressor cells). It binds to and inhibits the interactions of S100A9, an immunomodulatory protein that promotes tumor development, influences suppressive and pro-angiogenic cells in the tumor microenvironment, and participates in the establishment of pre-metastatic niches. Tasquinimod may also target the tumor microenvironment by suppressing the tumor hypoxic response, in which genes involved in the adaptation and survival of cells during hypoxia are induced. Tasquinimod reduces tumor angiogenesis; but its anti-angiogenic effects do not appear to be linked to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) neutralization or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition.  Clinical studies  A randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled phase II study comparing tasquinimod with placebo in 206 men with metastatic CRPC was completed in 2009. The primary endpoint in the trial was to show a difference in the number of patients with disease progression at 6 months. The proportion of patients who were disease progression-free after 6 months was 69% for patients treated with tasquinimod versus 37% for placebo- treated patients (p<0.001). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly improved in patients treated with tasquinimod compared with patients receiving placebo (7.6 vs 3.3 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39, 0.85, p=0.0042). Tasquinimod thus delayed disease progression by about 4.3 months. Overall survival (OS) observed for tasquinimod-treated patients was longer than previously reported in this patient population. Median overall survival was 33.4 months for the tasquinimod group versus 30.4 months for the placebo group (p=0.49). Using a multivariate analysis, treatment with tasquinimod was associated with an OS advantage with a HR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.42, 0.97, p=0.034). It was hypothesized that the prolongation in PFS observed with tasquinimod treatment may lead to a survival advantage in men with metastatic CRPC. Also, a stronger trend for survival benefit was seen in patients with bone metastases; 34.2 for the tasquinimod group vs 27.1 months for the placebo group (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46, 1.17, p=0.19). Analysis of up to 3 years of safety data from phase II studies showed that treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate, manageable and less frequent after 2 months of therapy. Adverse events observed included gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain as well as elevations of some laboratory parameters. A phase III randomized controlled trial called 10TASQ10 to confirm tasquinimod’s effect on disease progression is ongoing. More than 1,200 patients with asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC were successfully enrolled in the study, as planned in the clinical protocol. The study is expected to complete in 2016. Other indications are currently under investigation.

This species has a small, slender body with a yellowish green coloration. Both males and females measure between in length. Distribution and hosts Empasca decedens is believed to be native to the Mediterranean region and is widely distributed here. However, it has been recorded in Middle Eastern countries such as Iran and Pakistan and also in various western Asiatic countries, including China, North Korea and India. Recently, E. decedens has been found in Madeira Island, along with 3 morphotypes of Empoasca which reproduce parthenogenetically. Although it has generally been considered that E. decedens is a Mediterranean species, several publications show that it has a much wider area of distribution. Whether it is native to all of its range or has been recently introduced is not clear. Empoasca decedens can cause damage to many different food plants and is able to endure very diverse environmental conditions, which suggests that this species has a great potential to successfully colonize new areas. E. decedens has been recorded from 61 plant species of 50 genera belonging to 29 different families. These food plants are spontaneous and cultivated, including ornamental and horticultural plants and fruit trees. About half of its host plants are herbaceous plants but it is also associated with trees and, to a lesser extent, with shrubs, either deciduous or perennial. Damage Empoasca decedens is a highly polyphagous species, constituting an important pest to several cultivated plants including several fruit trees such as citrus, peaches, and almonds. It also damages many other cultivated plants such as cotton, raspberries, potatoes, vines and grain plants. The feeding on the leaves causes discoloration but other common effects are deformation of leaves, leaf curling and necrosis from the apex to the basis of the leaves, usually known as hopperburn. Apart from the damage to leaves, fruits such as oranges can also be attacked. On these, the insects cause pale yellow spots, which diminish the quality and the external appearance resulting in the loss of its commercial value. It has been demonstrated recently that this species can transmit phytoplasms to plums and apricots. Polyphagous species such as E. decedens represent a potential problem if they are introduced into new areas because they can shift to new food plants. Control The most common method of pest control is chemical and several of these have been tested. The recommended chemicals to control Empoasca decedens are organophosphates, nicotinoids and pyrethroids. These affect the nervous system or are growth regulation inhibitors.

Early life and career Matsuda was born in Kamoto, now part of the city of Yamaga. He entered the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in September 1913. He was graduated as a midshipman, placing 14th out of 95 students, on 11 December 1916 while on a training cruise aboard the cruiser Tokiwa. The cruise began at Sasebo and took him to the ports of Osaka, Shimizu, Maizuru, Incheon, Zhenhai, Dalian, Lushun, Weihaiwei and Qingdao. He returned to Japan on 3 March 1917, resuming his training on 5 April with another cruise in the South Seas which took him to Vancouver, San Francisco, Keelung, Hong Kong (San Pedro), Honolulu, Palau, Yap and Angaur. He returned to Japan on 17 August and joined the crew of the Haruna two days later. He was commissioned an ensign on 1 December and joined the battleship Kawachi. After the Kawachi was sunk in a magazine explosion on 12 July 1918, he rejoined the Haruna on 15 August before joining the cruiser Azuma as a supplementary guidance officer on 9 November. After a cruise in March 1919, taking him to Manila, Hong Kong and Singapore, Matsuda returned to Japan on 20 July. He was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 1 December and assigned to the Navy Torpedo School. He entered the Navy Gunnery School on 31 May 1920 and joined the cruiser Yūdachi on 1 December. He was appointed squadron strategy officer on the battleship Kongō on 1 December 1921. Promoted to lieutenant the following 1 December, he entered the 22nd graduate-level class at the Navy Gunnery School on the same day, graduating with honours on 29 November 1923 and assigned to the brand-new destroyer Kamikaze as chief gunnery officer. He was assigned as squad leader on the battleship Mutsu on 1 December 1924, and as an instructor at the Navy Gunnery School the following 1 December. On 1 December 1926, Matsuda joined the 26th class of students at the Naval War College, from which he graduated on 6 November 1928, placing 12th of 22 students in his class. He was promoted to lieutenant-commander on 10 December and assigned to the Bureau of Personnel in the Ministry of the Navy. Studying English at the American Language School, he was posted as an additional military attaché and aide at the U.S. embassy in May 1930. The following May, Matsuda was assigned to the Kiso as gunnery chief and was assigned to the first division of the Naval General Staff on 7 September. Promoted to commander on 15 November 1933, he was appointed to the Imperial Army General Staff on 2 April 1934 as a naval liaison officer, and was assigned to the second division of the Naval General Staff on 15 November. Wartime career During this time, Matsuda was involved in developing the basic design of the Yamato-class battleships. In 1935, he was appointed the executive officer of the light cruiser Abukuma, stationed off China. On 21 November, he was appointed a faculty member at the Naval War College, and was promoted to captain on 1 December. Viewed as among the naval officers sympathetic towards the mutineers in the 26 February Incident, the secret police put his name on a list of officers to be placed under surveillance in the wake of the failed coup. On 25 August 1938, he was given command of the seaplane carrier Kamoi, and rose to the rank of a section chief at the Naval General Staff headquarters by 1940. After travels to Europe and North America in 1940, Matsuda became a staff member at the Institute for Total War on 1 October. He was given command of the target ship Settsu on 1 September 1941, developing a manual to prevent air attacks during his time as captain. He was critical of Admiral Yamamoto's attack on Pearl Harbor that December, believing it to have been ultimately unsuccessful. On 20 February 1942, Matsuda was given command of the battleship Hyūga, and was given command of the Yamato on 17 December. He was promoted to rear admiral on 1 May 1943 and relinquished his command on 7 September, following his appointment as a senior staff officer at Imperial Headquarters, with the role of chief staff officer of the first division of the Naval General Staff. He was appointed squadron commander of naval aviation on 1 May 1944. Operation Kita In November, Matsuda commanded the Fourth Carrier Division, comprising the Hyūga and the battleship Ise, and sailed them to Singapore to reinforce the remaining naval elements in the Southwest Pacific. In early February, the two ships and their escorts received orders to return to Japan with much-needed supplies of oil, fuel and minerals. Despite American foreknowledge of the mission and several attempts to sink the ships with submarine and air attacks, all the vessels in the force returned to Japan with their valuable cargoes. This was one of the last Japanese victories of the war; subsequent efforts to transport supplies to Japan met with failure. Postwar In March 1945, Matsuda was appointed commander of the Yokosuka Naval Air Corps, a position he held at the time of Japan's surrender. Following the surrender, he entered the reserves on 1 November.IJN service record He was interrogated by U.S. Navy officers, who found him a \\"cooperative and agreeable witness, and his testimony was considered generally accurate, although there was perhaps some effort at self justification in the account of the movements of Ise and Hyuga on the night of 24–25 October.\\" Matsuda was critical about the effectiveness of Ise and Hyuga as converted carriers, and also criticised Imperial Navy policy of sending all front-line pilots into combat until all were killed; it would have been better if they had been rotated and some sent to train novice pilots.Transcript of interrogation After the war, he made a new career as a businessman, coming up with over a hundred patents for various inventions. Matsuda died on 6 November 1995, aged 99; at his death, he was the last surviving admiral of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

There has not been enough research to identify risk factors, common characteristics, or prevention strategies for SUDC. SUDC is similar in concept to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Like SIDS, SUDC is a diagnosis of exclusion, the concrete symptom of both being death. However, SIDS is a diagnosis specifically for infants under the age of 12 months while SUDC is a diagnosis for children 12 months and older. The causes of SIDS and SUDC are not known but there's a good chance heart arrhythmias and seizures are the main causes. It can happen to any child.  Hypotheses  Researchers are exploring a possible connection between sudden unexplained death in toddlers, febrile seizures, and hippocampal anomalies.  Epidemiology  SUDC is rare, with a reported incidence in the United States of 1.2 deaths per 100,000 children, compared to 54 deaths per 100,000 live births for SIDs, however it could be higher or lower SUDC deaths have occurred at the following sites: * Death at home, history provided: 79% * Crib or bassinet: 54% * Adult bed: 36% The placed and found positions were as follows: * Placed supine, side, prone*: 10%, 2%, 3% * Found prone: 89% * Found face position: down, side: 10%, 8% * Co-sleeping, sweating when found: 3%, 1% *applies only to youngest children History At the SIDS Alliance national convention in Atlanta, GA in 1999 Dr. Henry Krous gave a presentation titled \\"Post-Infancy SIDS: Is it on the rise?\\" This led to the beginning of the San Diego SUDC Research Project.

The BUIOH creates oral history memoirs by preserving an audio recording and transcript of interviews with individuals who are eyewitnesses to history; it provides both physical and digital access to these materials for those interested in the stories. The BUIOH is a sponsoring member of the Oral History Association (OHA), hosts the Texas Oral History Association (TOHA), participates in H-Oralhist (the oral history online discussion forum) and is active in the International Oral History Association (IOHA).

Charlton, the Program followed professional and ethical standards of oral history research established by the OHA. Its fundamental purpose was to collect oral history interviews, transcribe and edit them, and create finding aids for their use. The Program established a close working relationship with The Texas Collection archives division at Baylor University, which made the interviews available to researchers in accordance with legal agreements governing the use of each interview. In 1982, with the approval of President Herbert H. Reynolds, the Program for Oral History became the Baylor University Institute for Oral History and subsequently was authorized to broaden its research and professional scope.Baylor University |Institute for Oral History |1982 - 1993 Retrieved February 22, 2013. In 1992 Dr. Charlton became Baylor's Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs and by summer 1993, his new administrative responsibilities increased to full-time. When Dr. Charlton resigned as director later that year, the opening coincided with the availability of Rebecca Sharpless, the Institute's former Assistant Director, and she then became the Institute's second director.Baylor University |Institute for Oral History |1993 - 2007 Retrieved February 22, 2013. The Institute later that year moved from the basement of Tidwell Bible Building to the top floor of Carroll Library, overlooking the Burleson Quadrangle in the heart of the Baylor campus. During the 1990s, the Institute developed a web site which included information about the Institute, Workshop on the Web, online oral history tutorial workshop, and a searchable database of abstracts of its oral history collection. The Institute also assisted Baylor Libraries with the process of adding the oral history collection to the BearCat online catalog. From 1995 through May 1999, the Institute served as headquarters for the Oral History Association, with Rebecca Sharpless serving as Executive Secretary. In the 1990s the Institute hosted three major organizations: the Oral History Association, Texas Oral History Association, and American Studies Association of Texas. In 2003, Rebecca Sharpless began a three-year commitment to OHA culminating in her becoming the association's president in 2005-2006.Past Presidents Oral History Association Retrieved February 22, 2013 At the end of July 2006, Rebecca Sharpless left Baylor to pursue a position at Texas Christian University. While the university conducted a national search for an Institute director, Lois E. Myers served as the Interim Director. In August 2007, Baylor University announced Dr. Stephen Sloan as assistant professor in the Department of History and the new director of the Institute for Oral History.Baylor University |Institute for Oral History |2007 - 2010 Retrieved February 22, 2013. Dr. Sloan then initiated efforts to guide the Institute fully into the digital age, toward the goal of providing online access to sound files and transcripts gathered since 1970. Under the direction of Senior Editor Elinor Mazé, the Institute was able to include its collection finding aid within the Baylor University Library Digital Collections. Over the summer of 2008, Institute staff assessed the condition of its entire collection of analog sound recordings to prepare for ultimate digitization of open-reel and cassette tapes. During the 2008-2009 academic year, 350 memoir volumes comprising 50,500 typescript pages were digitized through the support of Baylor's Ray I. Riley Digitization Center. By February 2009 users of the BUIOH collection were able to access transcripts via electronic document delivery. This marked the shift of the Institute to a full-service reference and research center, adding end-user assistance to its collecting, processing, teaching, studying, and publishing activities.  TOHA  In 1982, Dr. Charlton became the founding president of the Texas Oral History Association (TOHA), choosing as its headquarters Baylor University, where it remains today. Rebecca Sharpless served as TOHA's first secretary- treasurer (1982–1987), and Lois Myers has held this position since. Since 1984, TOHA has sponsored program sessions in conjunction with the annual meetings of the Texas State Historical Association (TSHA). The meetings are held during the first week of March, commemorating Texas Independence Day. During the TOHA session, two or three oral history researchers present scholarly papers on topics related to the history and culture of Texas. TOHA also now holds an annual conference every April which showcases oral history research on Texas topics.Baylor University |Texas Oral History Association |Meetings and Conferences Retrieved February 22, 2013.

These project families are: * Arts & Culture * Baylor University * Bob Bullock * Education * Family Life & Community History * Historic Preservation * Religion & Culture * Special * Texas Baptist * Texas Judicial * Waco & McLennan County = Current projects = Among many others BUIOH is actively working on two major grant-funded projects: For the Greater Good: Philanthropy in Waco - Made possible through the generosity of the Cooper Foundation, this project focuses on interviews with philanthropists past and present in Waco's history to better understand the spirit of giving. A web portal will be published in Summer 2013 providing biographies, sound bytes and the details of the charitable impact of project participants. Texas Liberators of WWII Concentration Camps - Made possible through a grant from the Texas Holocaust and Genocide Commission, this project seeks to tell the stories of Texas World War II veterans who personally participated in the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. Twenty video interviews are planned, with resulting materials disseminated to the Commission for use in online presentations beginning in the Spring of 2013. Waco History - Through joint collaboration with Baylor's \\"The Texas Collection,\\" the Institute was able to create a resource for users to explore the legacy of Waco, Texas. Inspired by other projects using the software Curatescape, creators formed a mobile app and website that allows users to observe locations, people, and events within Waco through an interactive map. The project was launched in the spring of 2015.  Education  In 1971, Dr. Charlton received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop undergraduate and graduate curriculum offerings in oral history. The graduate seminar in oral history was first offered in the early 1970s and continues to through the present. Students are allowed to create a topic of investigation and conduct primary interviews while receiving instruction on the history, theory, proper procedure and technology of the profession. Throughout the decades the directors and staff of the BUIOH have participated in workshops throughout Texas and beyond. Ranging from academic symposia to community Q&A; sessions, these efforts help to educate individuals on the best practices in the profession as well as inform others of the work of the BUIOH. Beginning in the mid-1990s the Institute began compiling the materials from these efforts and published Workshop on the Web, an extension of the BUIOH website aimed at providing easy access to tutorials on a variety of oral history related topics. In July 2009, BUIOH conducted its first online workshop, Getting Started with Oral History. Fifteen oral history newcomers hailing from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Arizona, and Texas took part in the two-session interactive workshop. Participants are able to listen to the BUIOH staff explain key areas of oral history while viewing multimedia presentations on the topics. Practice project assignments are ascribed and Q&A; sessions held after each session. BUIOH has since offered its workshop online twice a year and has serviced a total of 117 participants to date from five countries.  Fellowships and grants = Active grants = BUIOH offers three active fellowships/grants to help enable local oral history projects:Baylor University |Institute for Oral History |Research Grants Retrieved February 22, 2013 * Faculty Research Fellowship - Baylor University faculty scholars interested in creating oral history memoirs in their area of interest may apply - provides a stipend as well as training, equipment, processing, and preservation support for faculty interview projects. * Community Oral History Grant - Texas nonprofit organizations may apply - provides financial support plus guidance in developing, conducting, processing, and presenting oral history projects created by the organization. * Charlton Oral History Research Grant - Partners the Institute with individual scholars who are conducting interviews of historical significance. The Institute helps to fund the interviews and provides processing, transcribing, and preservation for the project. This grant encourages the scholarship of advanced oral historians whose research could bring new insights to topics that have received little or no oral history application. = Past grants = In 2000, the Institute offered its first Visiting Research Fellowship which brought scholars to campus for two weeks each year to study materials in Baylor's oral history collection. From 2000 through 2011, the fellowship contributed to the scholarship of eleven outstanding historians. Ph.D. candidates and seasoned scholars alike have benefited from researching the diverse topics in the collection, including interviews on rural life, southern culture and religion, Western swing music, economics and politics, Baptist fundamentalism, the civil rights movement, and public education.  In the media  In 1987, the Institute produced a PBS radio program entitled \\"Lincolnville at Moccasin Bend: Black Families on the Texas Frontier,\\" based on interviews conducted in Coryell County, Texas. In 1989, the Institute invited filmmakers Allen and Cynthia Mondell to participate in Baylor's Distinguished Lecturers Series so that they could discuss their documentary films on the JFK assassination. In 1990, the Institute sponsored a public lecture on oral history and popular media, presented by documentary filmmaker Allen E. Tullos. With funding from the Cooper Foundation, the Institute presented to the public in 1991 its television production Crossroads, which discussed the interplay between the land and people that formed the history and culture of Waco, Texas. Crossroads appeared on public television and on the local Waco community cable access station. In August 2010, BUIOH launched a weekly radio program, Living Stories, based on its oral history collection. Airing on KWBU-FM 103.3 in Waco four times on Tuesdays, the radio segment topics range from the effects that momentous events such as the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean War had on individuals, to memories of school days, holidays, leisure activities, and daily life.Baylor University |Living Stories Retrieved February 22, 2013 The creator of the series, BUIOH editor Michelle Holland, also built an add-on web presence to the BUIOH site in order to archive the programs and allow users to read about and listen to the complete library of clips.Baylor University |Living Stories |• Radio Segments Retrieved February 22, 2013 Publications *Oral History for Texans (1981) An overall treatise on oral history techniques with particular focus on the history of the profession in Texas and resources available in the state.

He was arrested in 2009 and convicted in 2010. Since then he has published a tell-all book and given interviews about his career as a doping- enabler. Biography=Athletics= Matschiner was born 14 May 1975 in Laakirchen, Austria, and attended the Höhere Technische Lehranstalt in Vöcklabruck. He was a middle-distance runner at the University of Memphis. He claimed, in a 2011 interview, to have started using performance-enhancing drugs at the age of 25, when he was a 1500 metres runner. He ran in the second heat of the 1500 metres race at the 2002 European Athletics Indoor Championships but did not qualify for the semi-final. =Management and doping= After he retired as an athlete he worked as a manager and sports agent, founding the \\"International Sports Agency\\" in 2003. His first clients were Kenyan runners, with whom he says he discussed doping openly. His name came up in a doping scandal during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin when he was staying at the Turin house of Walter Mayer, a former skier and coach banned from all Olympic events; Matschiner at the time was working with Manfred Kiesl, in whose home doping substances were found in 1997. =Doping allegation and trial= His agency began managing high-profile clients such as Michael Rasmussen and Bernhard Kohl, and Matschiner helped his athletes by administering blood transfusions in the Austrian village of Steyrermühl between the spring of 2007 and May 2008. Kohl had finished third in the 2008 Tour de France and won the polka dot jersey for best climber, but was later found to have used the performance-enhancing drug EPO (specifically, the class known as CERA) and stripped of his position and jersey. Kohl stated in early 2009 that he had met Matschiner in 2005 and started doping after their first meeting. Matschiner was arrested shortly thereafter, and during the investigation by the special doping task force of the Vienna Bundeskriminalamt (BKA), many other names were turned up and accusations made. At the time of his arrest, his website listed a number of Kenyan athletes as clients; Athletics Kenya chairman Isaiah Kiplagat claimed that Matschiner \\"is a total stranger to us\\". Swiss cyclist Markus Zberg was, according to the BKA, given Dynepo by Matschiner on orders of Kohl; Matschiner named Zberg again in his guilty plea in 2010. During the trial, Kohl admitted having discussed doping with Zberg in March or April 2008 and to have given him Matschiner's number. Zberg did not comment in 2009, when the allegations were first made, nor in 2010, when they were repeated, though he hired an attorney. Also named in the investigation and in Matschiner's plea was Austrian triathlete Lisa Hütthaler. Hütthaler's name had been mentioned in early 2009 and she confessed to the Austrian media in March of that year, though Matschiner at that time denied; she stated she had paid Matschiner more than $20,000 for doses of EPO. Matschiner stated he had provided five other athletes with \\"EPO, testosterone, and growth hormones\\", but did not name them. Documents uncovered during the investigation incriminated other athletes as well. These included Dutch cyclists Michael Boogerd and Thomas Dekker, and were part of the dossier that led to Dekker's suspension from professional cycling in 2009. In 2010, Matschiner was sentenced by an Austrian court to a 15-month jail term; one month was taken off because he had spent five weeks in jail after his arrest and the rest of the sentence was suspended. During the trial, Matschiner explained in detail how he gave Kohl blood transfusions, though he denied having given Kohl CERA. He was placed on probation for three years. After the trial he showed no remorse, and announced a tell-all book, Borderline, to be published in January 2011. The publication of Matschiner's book (with Riva Verlag) in 2011 led to more media interviews, in which he stated he had no regrets and downplayed the health risks of doping. In an interview with Die Zeit, he said that doping is ubiquitous in all sports in all countries, and that athletes are very much aware of the risks: \\"only the stupid ones get caught.\\" From 2005 to 2007, he operated a blood bank, Humanplasma, which was responsible for delivering blood to various cycling professionals and other athletes; he claimed he stopped doing that in 2008 when the Austrian authorities enacted stronger anti-doping measures. In February 2013, Matschiner claimed to have given blood to a number of riders from the Dutch Rabobank team (including Denis Menchov, Michael Boogerd, who denied having used doping, and Thomas Dekker).

She captured several enemy vessels before she was converted to a water vessel in 1813. The Admiralty sold her in 1815. Career In 1809 Patriot was under the command of Lieutenant E. W. Mansel on the Heligoland station. On 29 May 1809nshe captured a privateer, the Danish cutter Snap, in the River Hever. Snap was armed with three guns and had a crew of nine. She had left Tonningen one week before but had made no captures. That same month Mansel advised Commander William Goate of that Patriot had captured a Dutch gunvessel of one gun, some swivel guns, and 10 men in the Jahde River, a Danish privateer of one gun, six swivels and 25 men, off Langerooz, and with the hired armed vessel Alert, destroyed two French privateers and a sloop, also in the Jahde. On 2, 4, and 5 June 1809 Patriot captured a \\"Danish Blankenaise boat\\" of unknown name, and two Dutch gunboats, Calais and Suapup. Later in June 1809 a landing party from , Patriot, and Alert, under the command of Mansell and Lieutenant M'Dougall of Alert, attacked some French customs officers and soldiers stationed at Ekwarden in the River Jahde. The British drove the French from their posts and captured two customs boats, and one Danish and five French galiots. The British brought out their prizes, together with merchandise that the Danes and French had seized. There were no British casualties. Then Lord George Stuart gave Goate command of a small force consisting of Musquito, the two Cherokee-class brig-sloops , and , five gun-brigs, including , and Patriot and Alert. On 7 July 1809 they entered the Elbe. There was an artillery battery at Cuxhaven so they anchored out of range of its cannons. Next morning at daylight Goate led a landing party but before they could attack the battery its 80-man garrison retreated, abandoning their guns. The British then loaded the battery’s six 24-pounders into vessels lying in the harbor, together with all the shot and military stores they could find and some other small guns. Next, they blew up the fort and seized two French gunboats, each of two guns. Lastly, the landing party handed the town of Cuxhaven back to the civil governor before returning to its vessels. Later, Mosquito, Basilisk and shared in the prize money. A month later, on 10 August 1809, Paz and Patriot were in company at Hocksyl. There they captured the Danish privateer Blankanaise, a sloop laden with linen, a lugger in ballast, and sundry goods. Two weeks later, Patriot, Paz, and the gun-vessels Censor and captured property at Harlinger Zyl, together with a Danish privateer and a mutt in ballast. The next month, on 11 September, , Patriot, Paz, and Jahde shared in the capture of vessels referred to in the prize-money announcement as Young Pincher, Young Paz, and Young Patriot. On 31 October, Patriot, in company with Alert, captured Dorothea. On 17 November 1809, Patriot was driven ashore on Düne in the Heligoland Bight. She was refloated, repaired, and returned to service. At some point Mansel died and Lieutenant William Hutchinson replaced him in command of Patriot. A biographical note reports that in 1810 Hutchinson was in command of a division of armed schuyts operating in the Elbe, Weser, and Ems.Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part 1, p.198. On 8 September 1810 Hutchinson was in command when Patriot and captured the \\"file and brick ships\\" Gute Hoffnung, Vrow Catherina, and Dree Gesusters. By 1811 Patriot was at Great Yarmouth.

Introduced in 1951, it originally ran via the German North–South railway line between Hamburg and Munich. Labelled as an international Trans Europ Express (TEE) train, it also linked with Zell am See and Klagenfurt in Austria from 1969. Trains were operated by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) and its Deutsche Bahn successor, from 1970 also by the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). The train's classification and formation (consist) varied over time. Since 1981, trains run from Dortmund to Klagenfurt, categorised as EuroCity service from 1987. It ceased to be a named train in 2002, but was revived in 2017 as an ÖBB EuroCity from Frankfurt to Klagenfurt, with through coaches onwards to Zagreb in Croatia. Name In 1953 the train was named after the mountain flower Blue Gentian (blau, German for blue, and Enzian, the German vernacular for Gentian, species Gentiana verna; ).TEE, p. 24. The name was the result of a prize competition initiated by Deutsche Bundesbahn among its passengers. Similar to the Edelweiss express train service introduced in 1928, it was associated with alpinism and the Alps. Route Over the years, the Blauer Enzian termini and route were altered so significantly that there is no section of line over which it always travelled. However, the train always either originated, terminated, or reversed direction, at München Hauptbahnhof. = Fernzug = alt=Observation car from one of the 1953 pair of trains In 1951, the West German Deutsche Bundesbahn announced the introduction of the Blauer Enzian as part of the then-new Fernzug network.TEE Züge in Deutschland, p. 109. It originally was planned that the North-South train would begin service on 1 July 1951, as FT 55/56. However, the FernTriebwagen (long-distance multiple unit) trainsets planned for the new service were not yet available by then, and the train instead entered service in autumn 1951 or later with normal carriages.TEE Züge in Deutschland, p. 110. The route of the F 55/56 express train, from Hamburg- Altona station to München Hauptbahnhof, included that of the first German high-speed railway, built later. Initially the train consisted of pre-war streamlined Reichsbahn Schürzenwagen carriages and a UIC-X prototype, hauled by steam locomotives of class 01 and diesel locomotives of class V 200, on electrified sections also by E 10 and pre-war DRG E 18 locomotives. In 1953 Deutsche Bundesbahn also performed extensive practical trials using a US EMD MRS-1 diesel-electric locomotive. From December 1953 until 1959 the former Henschel-Wegmann Train was used,TEE Züge in Deutschland p. 110. which was extensively restored including an observation car and former Rheingold 1928 diners. A second adjusted Blauer Enzian train was specifically built for the service running in the opposite direction. = Trans Europ Express = After the electrification of the railway lines around Hamburg in 1965, the Blauer Enzian was upgraded to a domestic Trans Europ Express.Das grosse TEE Buch, p. 82 The train began using TEE coaches hauled by the prototypes of the class E 03 (later class 103) high-speed locomotives. In 1968, the Blauer Enzian was the first German train with a scheduled operating speed of 200 km/h. In 1969, through coaches to Austria were introduced,La Légende des TEE, p. 236. with a final destination of Klagenfurt Hauptbahnhof via Salzburg and the Tauern Railway line. These cars were hauled by an ordinary express train south of Munich, still called Blauer Enzian and first-class-only, but not designated as a TEE.\\"Stop Press\\" (changes taking effect).

In 1970, the full Trans Europ Express route renumbered TEE 80/81 was extended to Austria and the train was split in Rosenheim, with one part going to Klagenfurt and the other to Zell am See via Kufstein and Wörgl.TEE Züge in Deutschland, p. 111. Although the Zell am See service had disappointing passenger numbers, it remained in the timetable to serve the expected tourists related to the 1972 Summer Olympics. In 1973, the Zell am See service was withdrawn. In the late 1970s, the Blauer Enzian was one of only three TEE trains running within Austria, the others being the Mediolanum and the Prinz Eugen.Nock, O.S.

Until 1977, the TEE Bavaria also ran through Austria, but for a distance of less than 20 km. = Intercity/EuroCity = On 27 May 1979, the Blauer Enzian was downgradedLa Légende des TEE, p. 238. to a two-class Intercity, no longer serving Hamburg, but instead, running southbound as Dortmund – Munich – Klagenfurt and northbound as Klagenfurt – Munich – Dortmund – Braunschweig.Thomas Cook International Timetable (May 27–June 30, 1979 edition), pp. 6, 68, 340, 355, 361. Peterborough, UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. The TEE service between Hamburg and Munich was taken over by the TEE Diamant.La Légende des TEE, p. 382. By 1981, the northbound route was also terminating in Dortmund. On 31 May 1987, the Blauer Enzian became part of the newly introduced international EuroCity network, with train number EC20 northbound and EC21 southboundThomas Cook Continental Timetable (May 31–June 30, 1987 edition), pp. 68, 472, 476.

Interesting was the change of through coaches among EC Blauer Enzian, EXP Dachstein (Lindau-Graz-Lindau), EC Transalpin (Basel-Wien/Graz/Klagenfurt) in summer 1990, in Schwarzach St Veit and Bischofshofen. The EC Blauer Enzian conveyed through coaches Dortmund- Klagenfurt/Graz/Lubljana. Until the opening of the first German high-speed railway on 2 June 1991, the route remained unchanged. On 2 June 1991, the route between Mainz and Augsburg was changed, to run via Mannheim, Heidelberg, and Stuttgart instead of Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and Würzburg – but still running Dortmund–Klagenfurt overall – and the train was renumbered to EC114 northbound and EC115 southbound. The name Blauer Enzian was abandoned from 14 December 2002. The name was revived in 2017 for the Frankfurt to Klagenfurt service, EC 112/113. This train meets the EC 212/213 Mimara at Villach and exchanges through coaches for services onwards to Ljubljana and Zagreb. The Dortmund to Klagenfurt service, still numbered EC 114/115, was renamed Wörthersee.

Newman's date of birth is given as \\"Bastille Day 1974\\". is an English journalist and presenter of Channel 4 News. Newman began her career as a newspaper journalist, and had spells at Media Week, The Independent, the Financial Times and The Washington Post. She has worked on Channel 4 News since 2006, initially as a correspondent and, since 2011, as a presenter. In 2018 she released Bloody Brilliant Women: The Pioneers, Revolutionaries and Geniuses Your History Teacher Forgot to Mention, a book detailing the lives of women in Britain in the 20th and 21st century. In 2020 she released It Takes Two: A History of the Couples Who Dared to be Different, a book about how great pairs, from romantic couples to sworn rivals, have made history. Early life Born in Guildford, Newman is the younger daughter of David Newman and his wife Julia Worsdall, both chemistry teachers, and has one sister. She attended a fee-paying girls school in Guildford until the age of 16, when she joined Charterhouse, where her father taught, as one of a few girls admitted to the school's sixth form. She has said that she stayed silent for years about the sexual harassment and other humiliation she experienced from fellow pupils. She was on the path to a career as a violinist or in the legal profession before changing her plans as a result of seeing BBC journalist Kate Adie on television. Newman read English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford,\\"Prominent LMH alumni\\" Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University website where she graduated with first-class honours. Career=Early career= After university, Newman briefly worked on The Guardian Books section, then at Media Week (as a trainee) and The Independent (as media business correspondent) before joining the Financial Times at the age of 23. Her older colleague Alice Rawsthorn acted as a mentor at the FT,Sophie Morris \\"My Mentor: Cathy Newman On Alice Rawsthorn\\" , The Independent, 28 August 2006 where Newman worked as a media and then (for three years) political correspondent. While Newman was working at the FT, David Yelland, the editor of The Sun, offered her a slot called \\"Better than Lex\\" (named after Lex, a column in the Financial Times). She seriously considered the offer, but later declined; the experience led to further opportunities in political journalism. Newman began a television career in 2000. She gained a Laurence Stern fellowship to work at The Washington Post for four months. During her period in the US, she followed the 2000 Presidential campaign of Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. =Channel 4 News= She joined Channel 4 News in January 2006 as a political correspondent and deputy to political editor Gary Gibbon.\\"Cathy Newman – Presenter\\" , Channel 4 News website In this role she broke several stories, including claims the Treasury pushed through the nomination of then Chancellor Gordon Brown's close friend Ronald Cohen for the House of Lords, challenging Peter Mandelson at the Brighton Labour Party conference in 2009, over his claimed use of the \\"c\\" word in a conversation with Rebekah Brooks (née Wade), the CEO of News International). Alongside this, she has also headed the team behind the FactCheck blog. From 2013 to 2015, Newman's pursuit of a story about the allegations of improper conduct levelled at Lord Rennard, once a leading figure in the Liberal Democrats, included her participation in an LBC local London radio phone-in on 27 February 2013 to quiz deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg on the issue. Newman has commented that sexism was endemic at Westminster during her period as a lobby correspondent there, but has also said that the newspaper industry is even worse. She told Natasha Lunn in an interview for Red magazine in 2016: \\"As a woman in the media I feel a duty to make sure we report those issues. I’ve always wanted to right injustices; I suppose what’s changed is I’ve now got a keener sense of how journalists can hold power to account\\". The victim of online sexism for her work, Newman gave her support for \\"public humiliation\\" of trolls in 2013: \\"the best way to tackle these people is to publicly humiliate them\\". A regular commentator on politics in other media outlets, Newman has appeared as a guest panelist on Have I Got News for You and blogs for The Daily Telegraph\\"Cathy Newman\\" , contributor page, telegraph.co.uk and Economia magazine.\\"Cathy Newman\\" , Economia contributor page Newman was long-listed for the Orwell Prize (Journalism) in 2010\\"Cathy Newman – Political correspondent\\" , The Orwell Prize, Journalism Prize, 2010 and again in 2011 for the blog prize.\\"Cathy Newman – The FactCheck Blog – Channel 4 News\\" , The Orwell Prize, Blog Prize, 2011 She was announced as one of the judges for the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction in 2015. In February 2015, Newman tweeted that she was \\"ushered onto the street\\" for being female when she went to South London Islamic Centre for a 'Visit My Mosque' programme.\\"Channel 4's Cathy Newman 'Ushered Out' Of London Mosque During Open Day\\" , Huffington Post, 1 February 2015 The mosque started receiving violent threats from the public as the story spread. A spokesperson for the Hyderi Islamic Centre had said Newman had simply visited the wrong address, and CCTV footage showed Newman had left the building on her own accord. Newman and Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear later apologised, acknowledging that Newman had mistakenly visited the wrong building. In January 2018, Newman interviewed the Canadian psychologist and professor of psychology Jordan Peterson, who is known for his criticism of political correctness. The combative interview covered topics such as gender equality, including the gender pay gap, freedom of speech, and transgender rights. The interview became a viral phenomenon on YouTube, where many commenters were critical of Newman, several of them saying she had a preconceived and misplaced grasp of Peterson's views. The New York Times columnist David Brooks said that Newman had \\"distorted, simplified and restated Peterson's views to make them appear offensive and cartoonish\\". Writing for The Guardian, Nosheen Iqbal stated that Peterson had made \\"broad generalisations on male and female behaviour\\" and that he denied the existence of the gender pay gap \\"as a qualitative fact\\". Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear said that the station had called in security specialists in response to social-media abuse and threats directed against her. Newman later shared that the abuse ranged from \\"cunt, bitch, dumb blonde\\" to \\"I’m going to find out where you live and execute you.\\" Peterson had told his followers to \\"back off\\" of Newman, but later denied that there was any evidence of threats, and stated that the idea that the abuse was driven by misogyny was \\"ridiculous\\". Following the interview, Newman observed that her Wikipedia page had \\"been rapidly edited back and forth\\", and that women generally are misrepresented in their Wikipedia biographies because the \\"internet is being written by men with an agenda.\\" Her book, Bloody Brilliant Women, concerning significant, but unheralded, 20th-century women, was published in 2018. The book presents case studies of both prominent and lesser known women throughout British history, finding parallels between their experiences and those of contemporary women. = Times Radio = In early 2020, Newman was announced by forthcoming radio station Times Radio as the presenter of their Friday drive time programme. She continues to present Channel 4 News whilst being a Times Radio presenter. Personal life Newman married writer John O'Connell, whom she met at university, in 2001. The couple have two daughters and live in London. Newman has written about having a miscarriage, and about deciding to abort another child, after discovering 13 weeks into her pregnancy that the baby had a very rare condition which meant there was a high chance that it would die.

Between December 29, 1910 and March 27, 1912 Filipescu was the Minister of War of Romania, in the Cabinet led by Petre P. Carp.  Biography  He attended the primary school in the Capital, after which he completed graduated from the high school in Geneva and law school in Paris.

On February 9, 1893, he was elected the mayor of Bucharest, a position that he held for almost two years, until 1895, when he became the mayor of Brăila. In 1899 the Conservatives returned to power and Filipescu was re-elected as MP. When the liberal council of the capital was dissolved, he was appointed the chairman of the Interim Commission. In 1898 he killed in a duel the journalist G. Em. Lahovari, the editor of the liberal newspaper \\"L'independance Roumaine\\" with which he had had a violent dispute.

He played a central administrative role during the Nordic War in 1657. Gavnø Gods  Personal life  Trolle was born in Ringkøbing and was a brother-in-law of Gregers Krabbe and Niels Krabbe. He was the son of vassal Børge Trolle (d. 1610). He studied at Herlufsholm School for 2 years, and later went on a field trip to Leipzig. Trolle returned home in 1615 only to leave again to study abroad in Giessen. After a brief visit to his home in Denmark, he studied at the University of Padua, and also in France and England. On 23 July 1626, he married Mette Corfitzdatter Rud, who died on 25 February 1632. In 1634, Trolle was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Copenhagen Castle, and on 16 October 1636, he married Helle Rosenkrantz (1618-1685), daughter of Holger Rosenkrantz, at Glimminge. The estate at Gavnø (Gavnø Gods) in Næstved was acquired by Niels Trolle in 1663. In the late 1660s, the church became a private chapel. It was embellished by his wife Lady Helle Rosenkrantz into one of Denmark's most colorful churches and is the only visible remnant of the priory.  Career  After serving in several positions as an agent of the nobility, Trolle was elected as a land commissioner in Zealand in 1638. He became a member of the Admiralty Court in Bremerholm in 1639. In 1643, when the Torstensson War started, he served as a general provisioning commissioner until the spring of 1645, when Christian IV offered him the position of vice admiral. Trolle did not play a major role in the war as a naval officer. Although he was ordered to aid in the defense of the island of Bornholm in June 1645, the island fell before his forces could participate, and his fleet and company were confined in the Copenhagen harbor. In August, the Second Treaty of Bromsebro (Brømsebrofreden) was signed and in September he participated in the exchange of ratifications in Markaryd for which the fleet was unprepared. Christian IV was very angry at him for his attitude against his father-in-law, Holger Rosenkrantz, during the procession of nobles in 1646. In 1647, he was a member of a commission to investigate the financial condition. Then in August 1648, he followed Frederick III to Akershus Fortress and received the Order of the Elephant (Ridder af Elefantordenen, R.E.), the highest order of Denmark. In February 1650, he joined the commission to report on the navy but resigned as vice-admiral due to infirmity in January 1651. He heard cases for Hannibal Sehested and Corfitz Ulfeldt, and in July was given a seat on the review commission to examine deliveries to Holmen. In 1655, he became a member of the newly established Admiralty. Trolle had been strongly considered for Governor of Norway in 1651 after Hannibal Sehested, and in 1656 he succeeded his brother-in-law Gregers Krabbe to the position. He was appointed to Akershus len (county) instead of Roskilde. Lieutenant General Jørgen Bjelke, commander-in-chief of the Norwegian army, was highly critical of Trolle's governorship due to his lack of support and inactivity during the second war with Sweden (1658–1660). In 1660, Trolle was among those at the great estates of the realm in Copenhagen who was most-incensed over Frederick III's revolution to install himself as an absolute monarch. Rumors spread among the opposition that he had been beaten by a Copenhagen. He gave in as did his companions, and became the privy council and nobility rapporteur by a declaration on 13 October. At the same time, he endured personal difficulties caused by Colonel Jørgen Løvenklaus. They had violent disagreements in October, which led to interrogations by the Royal commission. In March 1661, the Supreme Court acquitted Trolle of all Løvenklau's accusations and condemned his opponent to suffer as a liar. However, he complained that he was convicted by a court, which sat other than his right. Decline and death Trolle was succeeded as Governor of Norway by Iver Krabbe (1602–1666) in September 1661. He settled in Copenhagen, but was not taken in any of the new management colleges, felt strongly infringed by the new ranking rules of 1662, and was regarded for several years as an opponent of the government. He died on 20 September 1667, and was buried in the chapel of Roskilde Cathedral.

He frequently collaborates with label-mates as a musician, engineer, and record producer.  Early life  Jonathan Bree was born around the late 1970s in New Zealand. Mark Lyons, frontman of indie pop band The Nudie Suits, was both Bree's cousin and a mentor in Bree's formative years. When Bree was ten, Lyons introduced him to Modern Lovers, with Bree becoming a long-term fan. At 12 years old, Bree first played live (and recorded) as the drummer in Lyons' band, The Plaster Saints. Music career The Brunettes were formed in Auckland in 1998 by Bree and Heather Mansfield. According to Bree, \\"My cousin had recorded her band Yoko and I thought she had a great natural voice, no silly effected delivery. I was looking for a girl to sing on some duets I had written so I tracked down her number.\\" The band independently released its first recording Mars Loves Venus EP in 1998. In 2002, Bree founded Lil' Chief Records with fellow indie pop musician Scott Mannion of The Tokey Tones. The two men had met that year in Marbecks Record Store in Auckland, where Bree was working at the time. The Brunettes' album Holding Hands, Feeding Ducks released in 2002 was the debut release for the label. The album received a glowing review from Allmusic, as did the label's second release, The Brunette's 2003 The Boyracer EP. Bree produced both albums. The next two albums on the label were released simultaneously in 2003 by The Tokey Tones, and Bree guested on some of the tracks. Bree went on to release several more albums on Lil' Chief with The Brunettes. Their second album Mars Loves Venus was released in June 2004 followed by 2005's EP When Ice Met Cream. In 2004, Ryan McPhun started playing in band, who opened for The Shins 2005 tour of North America. They have also opened for Rilo Kiley, The Postal Service, Broken Social Scene, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, and Beirut and played at the 2006 Big Day Out festivals in New Zealand and Australia. The Brunette's album Structure & Cosmetics was released in July 2007 in New Zealand and August in the US, on Sub Pop. Their UK profile was lifted after their track \\"BABY\\" was featured in a UK campaign in December 2007, and the release of their music video. In 2008, The Brunettes covered The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\" for American Laundromat Records tribute compilation Just Like Heaven - a tribute to The Cure. In 2009, The Brunettes released the Red Rollerskates EP on Lil' Chief, shortly followed by Paper Dolls. In 2010, their song \\"Red Rollerskates\\" was included in soundtrack of the 2K Sports video game NBA 2K11. \\"Brunettes Against Bubblegum Youth\\" was featured on an extended advertisement for Hollyoaks in the UK. His first work post-Brunettes was as a co-producer on the Princess Chelsea album, Lil' Golden Book. He also supplied vocals for the song, \\"The Cigarette Duet\\" and directed the accompanying music video, which subsequently went viral - reaching nearly 40 million views in the years that followed. Bree's first work as a solo artist came in 2013 with the release of The Primrose Path. His next album, A Little Night Music, followed in 2015. Yet his big breakthrough came in the lead-up to his third album, when the song \\"You're So Cool\\" became a sensation on YouTube - drawing viewers with its odd depiction of a 1960s-style band whose faces were covered in spandex masks. It soon surpassed 1 million views and is currently at 14.4M views as of December 2019.

These specifically include the Pontic Greeks, though they today span a much wider region including the Russian north Caucasus, and the former Russian Caucasus provinces of Batum Oblast' and Kars Oblast' (the so- called Russian Asia Minor), now in north-eastern Turkey and Adjara in Georgia.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, Introduction. Greeks spread into these areas well before the Christian/Byzantine era, especially as traders, Christian Orthodox scholars/clerics, refugees, or mercenaries who had backed the wrong side in the many civil wars and periods of political in- fighting in the Classical/Hellenistic and Late Roman/Byzantine periods.Browning, Robert, p. 82. One notable example of such pre-modern Caucasus Greeks is the 7th-century Greek Bishop Cyrus of Alexandria, originally from Phasis in present-day Georgia. However, these Greek settlers in the Caucasus generally became assimilated into the indigenous population, and in particular that of Georgia, with whom Byzantine Greeks shared a common Christian Orthodox faith and heritage.Browning, Robert, p. 76. Official Russian Empire coat of arms of Kars Oblast (1881-1899). The vast majority of these Greek communities date from the late Ottoman era, and are usually defined in modern Greek academic circles as 'Eastern Pontic [Greeks]' (modern Greek - ανατολικοι Πόντιοι, modern Turkish 'doğu Pontos Rum'), as well as 'Caucasus Greeks', while outside academic discourse they are sometimes defined somewhat pejoratively and inaccurately as 'Russo-Pontic [Greeks]' (modern Greek - Ρωσο-Πόντιοι).Koromela and Evert, 1989 Nevertheless, in general terms Caucasus Greeks can be described as Russianized and pro-Russian empire Pontic Greeks in politics and culture and as Mountain Greeks in terms of lifestyle, since wherever they settled, whether in their original homelands in the Pontic Alps or Eastern Anatolia, or Georgia and the Lesser Caucasus they preferred and were most used to living in mountainous areas and especially highland plateaux.See Michel Bruneau, 'The Pontic Greeks: from Pontus to the Caucasus' In broad terms, it can be said that the Caucasus Greeks' link with the South Caucasus is a direct consequence of the highland plateaux of the latter being seen and used by the Pontic Greeks as a natural refuge and rallying point whenever North-eastern Anatolia was overrun by Muslim Turks in the Seljuk and Ottoman periods. Ancient and medieval history Caucasus Greek officer from Mouzarat (now Çakırüzüm köyü), Ardahan district, former Russian south Caucasus province of Kars Oblast Although large numbers of Greeks live in parts of Ukraine and southern Russia, such as Mariupol and Stavropol Krai, the term Caucasus Greeks strictly speaking should be confined to those Greeks who had settled in the former Russian Transcaucasus provinces of Batum and Kars Oblast', parts of Georgia such as the region around Tsalka, central Abkhazia and other localities of the Black Sea Russian Riviera. Following the Ottoman conquest of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461 large numbers of Pontic Greeks left the Pontic Alps region as refugees and resettled in parts of the South Caucasus, and particularly Georgia. Even the son of King David of Trebizond's son George had fled there with his retinue and married a Georgian princess of the Gurieli dynasty.Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, p. 53. However, The numbers of these early Pontic Greek refugees to Georgia were in any case probably fairly small, and so although some of the refugees managed to retain their Pontic Greek language and identity, others assimilated through intermarriage into the other Christian communities of the South Caucasus region, particularly their fellow Christian Orthodox Georgians but also those Armenians or Ossetians who were Orthodox.Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, p. 64. Early modern period To complicate matters further, many so-called \\"Ottoman Turks\\" who settled in Georgia and the South Caucasus following Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign of the 1570s were actually Pontic Greeks from northeastern Anatolia who had adopted Islam and the Turkish language for official purposes but continued to use Pontic Greek in their daily lives, with one prominent example of an Ottoman Muslim Georgian of Pontic Greek origin being Resid Mehmed Pasha. These Greek Muslims who adhered to Islam in Georgia also either eventually assimilated with the Turkish-speaking Muslim population of southern Georgia usually defined as Meskhetian Turks, returned to parts of eastern Anatolia such as Kars following the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, or reverted to their Greek Orthodoxy following the annexation and reintegrated into the Greek Orthodox population of the country.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 73. Finally, according to available historical evidence we know that thousands of Pontic Greeks from Ottoman north-eastern Anatolia and especially the Gümüşhane (Greek Argyroupolis) region of the Pontic Alps are known to have gone to Tsalka in 1763 on being invited by King Heraclius II of Georgia to develop silver and lead mining at Akhtala and Alaverdi (in present- day Armenia).Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, pp. 54-62. Many of their descendants survive in Georgia’s Marneuli district, although most immigrated to Greece, and particularly Thessaloniki (Salonika) in Greek Macedonia in the mid-1990s.Eloyeva, p. 87. It is difficult to verify the numbers of all such waves of Pontic Greeks from the Pontic Alps region to Georgia and the South Caucasus between circa 1520 and 1800, which according to Anthony Bryer is the most obscure period in the history of Pontus and the Pontic Greeks, owing to the scarcity of contemporary Greek and Ottoman Turkish sources on the subject.Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), XI., p. 199. Modern historians suggest that following the Ottoman conquest of 1461, many, if not most Pontic Greeks retreated up into the highlands, where it was easier to maintain their culture and freedom from the encroachments of the Ottoman authorities. This movement was reinforced in the early 1600s by the growing power along the coastal valleys districts of the derebeys ('valley lords'), which further encouraged Pontic Greeks to retreat away from the coast deeper into the highlands and up onto the eastern Anatolian plateau, before some moved further east into the neighbouring Lesser Caucasus around Kars and southern Georgia.See also Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), V., p. 142. Modern historians also suggests that a major migratory movement of Pontic Greeks onto the eastern Anatolian plateau and the Lesser Caucasus occurred in the reign of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–87), during which a common pattern was initiated in Ottoman history: the Ottomans and their clients the Crimean Tatars suffered a string of severe defeats at the hands of the expansionist Russian Empire and so followed this up with a wave of repression against the Greeks of both the southern Balkans and the Pontic Alps region, on the pretext that Greek statesmen and traders had colluded with the Tsar. As a result, many Pontic Greeks felt pressured into following their cousins who had left Pontus as refugees in previous generations, and so they too decided to migrate to southern Russia or neighbouring Georgia and the South Caucasus.See also Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), XI, p. 42. However, the largest number of Pontic Greeks from north-eastern Anatolian who settled in Georgia, according to extant historical evidence, were those who fled Ottoman reprisals following the 1768-74 Russo-Turkish war, the Greek War of Independence, the 1828-29 Russo-Turkish War, and the war of 1853-56, which unlike earlier such movements are more widely attested in documentary evidence and traditionally cited by many Pontic Greeks themselves.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 29. In the war of 1828-29 many north-eastern Anatolia Greeks welcomed, collaborated with, or fought in the Russian Army that occupied Erzurum, Gümüşhane, Erzinjan, and Kars (all now in north-eastern Turkey).Anderson, 1967Coene (2011), p. 67. Most of their descendants settled in Georgia (in areas such as Tsalka and Samtskhe- Javakheti), the Russian Trans-Caucasus, and other parts of southern Russia. A smaller number of such Pontic Greeks had of course settled in Georgia and the Russian Caucasus well before the Russo-Turkish wars, most notably those belonging to noble and landowning families from the pre-Ottoman Empire of Trebizond.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 28. These included several members of the late Byzantine Komnenos or Comnenid dynasty and collateral branches, who often married into princely families from neighbouring Georgia, including those of the Bagrationi and especially the Gurieli and Andronikashvili.Browning, p. 119. Among those who remained in the Pontic Alps and north-eastern Anatolia some led local revolts against the Ottomans, while many others actually intermarried into the Ottoman ruling elite, thereby converting to Islam and joining the Turkish millet.Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, p. 66. Several Ottoman-era sources tell us, however, that even among Pontic Greeks belonging to local noble families - such as those of Gavras, Doukas and the Komnenoi - who had turned Turk, many remained Crypto-Christian (in north-eastern Anatolia often referred to as Stavriotes), openly renouncing Islam and taking up arms against Ottoman troops based around Gümüşhane and Erzinjan during the Russo-Turkish wars, before following the Russian army back into Georgia and southern Russia.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 88. It was some of these Pontic Greek community leaders that claimed noble lineages extending back to the Empire of Trebizond who subsequently became officers in the Russian Imperial army, as many Armenian and Georgian princes such as Ivane Andronikashvili had previously done.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 33. These Caucasus Greek officers, whether of noble Byzantine or more humble Pontic Greek origin, played a significant role in the 1877 Russian conquest of Kars and Ardahan, where many of them settled with their families and other displaced Greeks from northeast Anatolia and Georgia (the latter themselves the descendants of pre-1877 Greek refugees and exiles from northeast Anatolia now re-settled in Kars by the Russian Imperial government).Eloyeva, p. 27. Caucasus Greek cleric and community leaders Language A large number of Caucasus Greeks who settled in Georgia became referred to as Urum (from the Turkish for '[Byzantine] Romans') and speak a Turkish dialect with a large admixture of Pontic Greek, Georgian, and Armenian vocabulary.Eloyeva, 1994 According to local Greek legend, after the suppression of their revolt against Ottoman rule these Turkish-speaking but Christian Orthodox Caucasus Greeks had been given the choice by Sultan Selim I either to accept Islam but continue to use their Greek mother tongue, or to use the Turkish language but retain their Christian Orthodox faith.Topalidis, p. 98. Selim I had been based in the Trebizond region before he became Sultan in 1512, since he was himself of partly Pontic Greek origin on the side of his mother Gülbahar Hatun.Koromela, p. 43.Bryer, The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus, (Variorum, 1980), XI., p. 41. Nevertheless, most Caucasus Greeks had never had to face this predicament of having to choose between their Christian Orthodox faith and their Pontic Greek language and so were able to retain both, although when in Russian territory they eventually came to adopt Russian as their second language for public and educational purposes.Acherson, ch. 10. Caucasus Greeks also often maintained some command of Turkish as more or less a third language, thanks to their own roots in north-eastern Anatolia, where they had after all lived (usually very uneasily and in a state of intermittent warfare) alongside Turkish-speaking Muslims since the Seljuk-backed Turkish migrations into 'the lands of Rum' or Anatolia during the 11th and 12th centuries.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 17. Pontic Greeks in Georgia and the Russian Caucasus also maintained this command of Turkish so as to communicate with their Muslim neighbours living in the region, most of whom used Turkish as a lingua franca or even adopted it as their first language irrespective of actual ethnic origin.Coene, ch. 1. This situation is in stark contrast to that of the Greek Muslims of western Greek Macedonia called Vallahades and the Cretan Muslims, both of whom generally remained ignorant of Turkish, continued to use Greek as their first language, and retained Greek culture and traditions long after converting to Islam in the middle Ottoman period. Of course, while many Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks had also adopted Islam as early as the 1500s or before, these \\"new Turks\\" generally either adopted Turkish and then assimilated into the Turkish-speaking Muslim Ottoman population or they remained Crypto-Christian and then openly reverted to their Christian Orthodoxy on the occasion of the 1828 Russian occupation of northeastern Anatolia or after the passing of the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 55. Russian siege of Kars, 1828 It should be stressed, then, that the vast majority of these eastern Pontic Greeks who had settled in southern Russia, Georgia, and the Trans-Caucasus region but preserved their distinct Greek identity were mainly the descendants of the Greeks who left the Pontic Alps and the northeast Anatolian highland region after the Russo-Turkish wars of 1768-74 and 1828–29. Contrary to certain popular myths, these Pontic Greek settlers therefore had absolutely nothing to do with those Greeks who had settled in the South Caucasus region in the Hellenistic or Classical Greek period, although they generally did merge with those somewhat smaller Pontic Greek communities who had settled in Georgia, Armenia, and the South Caucasus in general in the late Byzantine and early Ottoman period.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 63. The main reason Caucasus Greeks preferred to identify themselves exclusively with the later, particularly 19th century waves of Pontic Greek refugees to the South Caucssus rather than also with ancestors who had already settled in the region in the late Byzantine or early Ottoman period is probably because this helped in the presentation of their history as being linked for a longer period to the territories ruled by the Empire of Trebizond, that is Pontus proper, and also helped minimize the historically inconvenient evidence of both substantial non-Greek influences on their culture and extensive intermarriage with the indigenous, non-Hellenic races of the South Caucasus region.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 67. According to conservative estimates these eastern Pontic Greeks who collaborated with and/or followed the Russian army into Georgia and southern Russia following the 1828 Russian occupation of Erzurum and Gümüşhane had made up around 20% of the entire Greek population of the eastern Black Sea coastline and the Pontic Alps that formed its mountain hinterland.Papadopoulos, p. 54. They were subsequently resettled by the Russian Imperial government in the Ukraine and other parts of southern Russia, but also especially Georgia and (after 1878) Kars Oblast.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 61. Like those Pontic Greeks who fought for Russia in the 1768-74 Russo-Turkish war, most male Greeks who settled in Russian territory following the 1828-29 war continued to serve in the Russian Imperial army, often bearing their own community's hopes to re-capture more Christian Greek territory from the Muslim Turks on the back of the Russian Empire. Like Georgians, Armenians, and other peoples from the South Caucasus, many Caucasus Greek men fought and lost their lives through service in the Russian army not just in wars against the Ottomans, but also in other campaigns, such as the 1817-1864 Caucasian War, in which Russia sought to impose its rule over the Muslim mountain tribes of the north Caucasus.Papadopoulos, p. 75. Role in Russian conquests Pontic Greek militia fighters. The 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War and the Treaty of San Stefano and Treaty of Berlin that brought it to a close led to the Russian Empire making permanent gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire in north-eastern Anatolia.Drury, Ian, The Russo-Turkish War of 1877 These centred around the fortified city of Kars in historical northern Armenia, which Russia now administered as Kars Oblast, i.e. the militarily administered province of Kars, which also included the towns and districts of Ardahan and Sarikamish. As in the 1828-29 war, many Greeks of north-eastern Anatolia and Pontus fought in or collaborated with the Imperial Russian Army in the 1877-78 war against the Ottomans, often serving as soldiers and officers in an army that included large numbers of Georgians, Armenians, Ossetians and Cossack, as well as Russians proper - the Georgians and Armenians in particular being represented among the senior ranks. Although the Ottoman province or 'vilayet' of Kars already had several Greek villages dating back to 1830 or sometimes even earlier, most of these later pro-Russian Greeks of north-eastern Ottoman Anatolia settled in Kars province after it was incorporated into the Russian empire in 1878.Topalidis, 2006 It was precisely because most of the Greek settlers in Kars Oblast had entered the region with the Russians from the direction of Georgia, that contemporaries - and academics later on - came to define them as Caucasus Greeks or Russianized Pontic Greeks, in contrast to those Greek who had never left Ottoman-ruled North-eastern Anatolia. Even in Russian occupied Georgia, however, these Greeks had generally lived in the southern areas of the country which - like the Kars-Ardahan region - were part of the Lesser Caucasus highland plateau, rather than among the deep valleys and jagged mountain peaks of the High Caucasus range in northern Georgia. In terms of population, the areas in both Georgia and Kars province inhabited by the Caucasus Greeks tended to be those that also had large concentrations of Armenian population - one well-known product of this Greek-Armenian mix being the famous mystic and theosophist George Gurdjieff. Another well known, although more recent Caucasus Greek with roots in these areas but born in Tbilisi was Yanis Kanidis, a Russian PE instructor and hero of the Beslan school hostage crisis in North Ossetia. These same areas now in Georgia also had various pockets of Muslims of Turkish and non-Turkish (convert) ethnic origin - though the latter had generally become Turkish in speech and culture.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 43. Pontic Greek leaders from Georgia The Caucasus Greeks of Kars Oblast were mainly concentrated in around 77 towns and villages as part of official Russian government policy to people a traditionally Turkish, Kurdish, Georgian-Muslim (here often called Chveneburi) and Laz-Muslim or Christian but generally non-Orthodox Armenian area with a staunchly pro-Russian Christian Orthodox community.Koromela, p. 74. In general they were settled on grassy highland plateaux, such as the Gole/Kiolias plateau of present-day Ardahan province, since these resembled their original lands in the Pontic Alps and later ones they had settled on in Georgia. In towns like Kars, Ardahan, and Sarikamish ethnic Greeks constituted only a small minority (10-15%) of the inhabitants, most of whom were Christian Armenians, Kurdish Muslims, or smaller numbers of Orthodox Georgians, while even many of the mainly ethnic Greek villages still included small numbers of Armenians (including Greek Orthodox Armenians), Georgians, and even Kurds, employed by the Greeks to look after the sheep, cattle, and horses.Mikhailidis & Athanasiadis, pp. 45-76. The Caucasus Greeks of Kars Oblast were generally reasonably well educated, every village having its own school, although most were involved in farming, horse breeding, or mining for their livelihoods. A smaller but still significant number did, however, work outside the agricultural and mining sectors. In particular, many pursued careers as regular soldiers and officers in the Russian Imperial Army, in the regional police force, as clergymen, or even within the provincial Russian administration. Unlike the Pontic Greeks of the Black Sea coastal cities like Trebizond, however, very few Caucasus Greeks were involved in trade.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 42. Ataköy), Kars Oblast, circa 1900. Caucasus Greek commander of Cossack auxiliaries in the Russian Imperial Army - Vasil-Aga (Vasilis Anthopoulos) and his family Mount Falakro, Drama Prefecture, eastern Greek Macedonia, where many Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks resettled Caucasus Greeks were often multilingual, able to speak, read, and write Greek and Russian and speak Eastern Anatolian Turkish, and sometimes also basic Georgian and Armenian.Koromela, p. 96. Although their native language was Greek, generally only the most highly educated - such as scholars, lawyers, members of the Orthodox clergy educated in Russian universities, and other community leaders claiming noble or royal lineage extending back to the Empire of Trebizond - had more than an intermediate-level knowledge of formal Demotic Greek and the more classicizing Katharevousa of the late Byzantine period.Mikhailidis & Athanasiadis, p. 59. The majority were restricted to their own variant of Pontic Greek, which had a somewhat larger admixture of Turkish, Georgian, Russian, and Armenian vocabulary than the colloquial form of Greek used in Pontus proper.Topalidis, 1996, and Koromela & Evert, 1989 However, the Caucasus Greeks had had to become fluent Russian speakers, as a result of the schooling and education policies implemented by the Russian Imperial government, although at home and amongst themselves they continued to favour Greek.Mikhailidis & Athanasiadis, p. 60. But Caucasus Greeks were still often conflated or confused with Russians in Kars Oblast because of their use of Russian and worship alongside Russians in the same Orthodox churches as well as their generally Russianized and pro-Russian empire outlook. In fact, one quite popular but stereotyped way local 'Turks' might differentiate Caucasus Greeks from other Pontic Greeks was by stating that the former were \\"Greeks who had taken the Borshch [soup] from the Russians\\"!Kazanoglu, 'Greeks in Kars'. The Caucasus Greeks had close social links with the Greek Orthodox Russian settlers of Kars Oblast through worshiping in each other's churches as well as marrying partners of Russian Caucasus origin. These links were closer than those with either non-Orthodox Armenians or Orthodox Georgians, primarily because most of the former were not in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople while many of the latter were becoming increasingly attracted to Georgian nationalism. However, contacts and intermarriage between Caucasus Greeks and Armenians who were members of the Greek Orthodox church was fairly common, and to a lesser extent also existed between Caucasus Greeks and other Greek Orthodox communities of the South Caucasus, such as Georgians or Ossetians.Koromela, p. 53. Since many of the indigenous Turkish-, Kurdish-, and Laz-speaking Muslims from the Kars region had fled westwards into Ottoman territory during and after the 1877-78 war, many other non-Orthodox Christian communities were also resettled there by the Russian administration.Caucasus Calendar, Introduction. These included Russian religious minorities considered \\"heretical\\" by the Russian Orthodox Church, such as Dukhobors and Molokans, who as pacifists did not perform Russian military service and so unlike the Caucasus Greeks, Georgians, and Armenians did not play a significant role in the wars against the Ottomans. Even smaller numbers of Caucasus Germans, Estonians, Poles, and Lithuanians, were settled in Kars Oblast, despite none of these communities having any significant historic or cultural links with the Transcaucasus and Eastern Anatolia, in contrast to the long-standing links Pontic Greeks had always had with the region.Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, 1991 Contemporary (post-World War I) During World War I most able-bodied Caucasus Greek men again fought for Russia against the Ottoman Empire, usually serving in the Russian Caucasus Army, which was led by a coterie of senior Russian, Georgian, and Armenian officers. In the final stages of the war, a Greek Caucasus Division was even established by bringing together Caucasus Greeks from different regiments of the Russian army in the South Caucasus and whose primary purpose was to help defend ethnic Greek villages in the Kars, Erzerum, and Erzincan regions. Most Caucasus Greeks left Kars Oblast following the cession of the area back to the Ottoman Empire in 1917 but before the official population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1922-23.Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, p. 8. They mainly settled in villages in Greek Macedonia previously inhabited by Ottoman Muslims and again generally preferred those situated on grassy plateaux or mountain districts, since these most closely resembled their former home in the South Caucasus. However, like many other Greeks of Pontus and north-eastern Anatolia, significant numbers of Caucasus Greeks who wanted to remain in what was now Turkish territory at any cost chose to convert to Islam and adopt the Turkish language for public purposes so as to be exempted from the population exchange.Papadopoulos, 2012. According to the terms of the population exchange protocol (which was essentially an appendage to the Treaty of Lausanne) the categories 'Greek' and 'Turk' were defined by religious affiliation rather than ethnicity, resulting in large numbers of Greek Muslims from Macedonia and Crete being categorized as 'Turkish in soul' and so resettled in the Turkish Aegean and parts of Anatolia.Koromela, p. 66. Those Caucasus Greeks who had remained in north- eastern Anatolia, like the many other Pontic Greeks who had also converted to Islam and adopted the Turkish language, subsequently became assimilated into the wider Turkish-Muslim population of the provinces of Trabzon, Sivas, Erzurum, Erzinjan, Kars, and Ardahan.Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, 1991. However, after 1917 many Caucasus Greeks from Kars Oblast, and in particular those who had close Russian family links through intermarriage, also resettled in parts of Southern Russia that already had pre-existing communities of Pontic Greeks descended from earlier waves of refugees from northeastern Anatolia. These Greeks were based mainly in Stavropol Krai, in the foothills of the North Caucasus, where they still make up a significant elements of the population (often up to 10%) in both urban and rural areas. They became fully assimilated into modern Russian life and society, although following the dissolution of the Soviet Union they substantially increased their links with Greece - and particularly with northern Greece - through work, trade, or study in their \\"mother\\" country and through taking up Greek nationality alongside their Russian one.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 86. Caucasus Greeks in contemporary Greek Macedonia Most of the Caucasus Greeks of Kars Oblast who had not sided with the Bolsheviks subsequently left for Greece in 1919, before the province was officially re-incorporated into the territory of the new Turkish Republic and the large-scale Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1922-23.Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, p. 79. Most were resettled in Kilkis province and other parts of central and eastern Greek Macedonia, particularly in villages of the mountainous Drama prefecture that until 1922 had been inhabited largely by \\"Turks\\" (in this case Ottoman Muslims of mainly Bulgarian and Greek Macedonian convert origin).Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, ch. 7. During the German occupation of Greece (1940–44) and Greek Civil War of 1943-49 most Caucasus Greek men fought for ELAS, the military wing of EAM, the leading Greek communist guerrilla organisation that fought against the German occupation.Woodhouse, 1984 Many in Greece argue that the strong communist affiliations of Greek Macedonia's Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks, most of whom even today continue to support the Greek Communist Party KKE, has never had anything to do with ideology but was actually due to residual pro-Russian sentiment and traditional family expectations, despite the fact that many had grandparents who had not remained in Russian territory precisely because they had not sided with the Bolsheviks. The communist affiliations of most Caucasus Greeks has also been cited to account for why they often play down or even conceal any previous involvement their ancestors may have had in the Tsarist army or administration during the Russian occupation of the Transcaucasus region.Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, p. 143. For those communist Caucasus Greeks who following the 1946-49 Greek Civil War settled as refugees in the Eastern Bloc, particularly the USSR and Czechoslovakia, playing down or concealing their community's previous links with the Russian Empire was an essential tactic to ensure a safe, secure, and flourishing life in a communist state and society. One example of a high ranking Caucasus Greek from Kars Oblast who spent much of his life fighting and propagandizing against Soviet communism, after having fought against the Bolsheviks with the forces of the White movement, was Constantine Kromiadi. Caucasus Greek community leaders and young army cadets of Kars, circa 1900. Caucasus Greeks have generally assimilated well into modern Greek society, being successful within a broad range of trades and professions. They are generally conflated by other Greeks with the Pontic Greeks of Pontus proper, whom many in Greece see as very socially conservative, clan-like, and inward-looking. Otherwise, Caucasus Greeks are often inaccurately described by other Greeks as 'Russo-Pontic [Greeks]' and sometimes even confused with the many ethnic Greeks who came from Georgia and southern Russia in the mid-90s, particularly since they often live in the same parts of Thessaloniki, share a similar Pontic Greek dialect, and tend to have surnames ending in '-dis' (from the Ancient Greek for 'the sons of ... ').Xanthopoulou-Kyriakou, p. 121. However, it is generally the ethnic Greeks who came to Greek Macedonia from Georgia and southern Russia in the mid-1990s rather than the Caucasus Greeks who came shortly after 1919 that other Greeks often accuse of among other things being involved in organised crime in northern Greece and the wider Balkans and creating a kind of parallel, underground society. The Caucasus Greeks and Pontic Greeks in general who settled in northern Greece between 1919 and 1923 have, on the other hand, had a lot more time to assimilate into contemporary Greek society than the more recent arrivals from Georgia and southern Russia, and as a consequence have a far better command of standard Modern Greek and awareness of mainstream Greek culture.Topalidis, p. 82. The Caucasus Greeks and Pontic Greeks of Greek Macedonia have still managed to preserve some of their unique traditions and have also established many cultural and civil society organisations. The aspect of Pontic Greek culture most apparent to the outside observer is their traditional food, costume, music, and dance, with those of the Caucasus Greeks reflecting heavier Russian, Georgian, and Armenian influences. For example, the traditional costume of Caucasus Greek women resembles that of southern Russian women, while the men's costume is light grey, in contrast to the black attire worn by Greek men from Pontus proper, which they share with the Muslim Laz of the eastern Pontic Alps.Topalidis, p. 137. List of settlements in the Russian Transcaucasus with a sizeable population of Greeks Although precise figures are difficult to verify it is likely a total of around 56,350 Greeks lived within Kars Oblast until 1919. The following is a list of the towns and villages in which they lived, given in both Greek and English transliteration. The names of the vast majority of these settlements are evidently of Turkish or Armenian origin in Kars Oblast’, of Georgian origin in Batum Oblast and even many majority-Greek settlements were also inhabited by Christians from other ethnic groups, particularly Orthodox Georgians, Orthodox and/or Gregorian Armenians, and Orthodox and/or “Sectarian” Russians.Σάββας Καλεντερίδης, “Ανατολικός Πόντος”, 2006.Ισαάκ Λαυρεντίδη,“Μετοικεσία Καυκασίων 1895-1907”.Ιωάννης Καλφόγλου Μαρκήσιο-Φωτιάδη, “Οι Έλληνες εν Καυκάσω”, Αθήνα (1908).Статистика Россійской Имперіи: Перепись 1886 годъ (Statistics of the Russian Empire: Census 1886).1-й годъ Памятная Книжка и адресъ-календарь КАРССКОЙ ОБЛАСТИ на 1902 годъ, изданіе КАРССКАГО ОБЛАСТНОГО Статистическаго Комитета подъ редакціею Секретаря Комитета С.

W. Crabb, Hiram Walker Crabb or Hamilton Walker Crabb, (January 1, 1828 – 1899) was a pioneer American wine cultivator, considered one of the pioneers of the development of the Napa Valley as a wine region. In the 1880s, his vine collection was one of the largest in the world. To-Kalon Vineyard Early years He was born in Jefferson County, Ohio on January 1, 1828, the eldest son of Henry and Esther Walker Crabb. In 1840 the family relocated to Adams County, Ohio, until 1853, when he settled in San Lorenzo, California. Career In 1865, he moved to Napa. Three years later, he bought land near Oakville, close to the Napa River; and sold some of that land in the same year to build the railroad depot. His early establishment, Hermosa Vineyard, produced table grapes and raisins. In 1872, Crabb established a vineyard and winery named \\"To-Kalon\\", (Greek: \\"the call of beauty\\") and by 1877 had planted and was producing 50,000 US gallons of wine per year. By the later half of the 1880s, the vineyard covered 1,100 acres. Crabb's collection of vines was one of the largest in the world at that time, including more than 400 varieties; in the following decade, he was referred to as the \\"Wine King of the Pacific Slope\\" by the Chicago Herald. Crabb experimented with over 400 grape varieties to find the types best suited for the area, including Zinfandel, Burgundy, Petite Syrah, Beclan, Cauche Noir, Cabernet, Riesling, Pinot Chardonay, Muscatelle and Sauterne. The Refosco or Mondeuse was occasionally referred to as Crabb's Black Burgundy prior to Prohibition in California. His Zinfandels received awards at the San Francisco Midwinter Fair (1894) and at the Alaska-Yukon Exposition (gold medal, 1909). Along with another one of California's early winegrower, John Lewelling, Crabb developed a method for shipping grapes on ice. With agencies in New Orleans, the Midwest and the East, Crabb shipped his wine in cases and in bulk. After Crabb's death in 1899 of apoplexy, the estate was owned by the E. W. Churchill family until 1943, when it was bought by Martin Stelling. Most of Crabb's To- Kalon acreage is now owned by the Robert Mondavi winery. The remaining To- Kalon acreage is owned by the Opus One Winery, Beckstoffer Vineyards, Detert Family Vineyards, MacDonald and the University of California.

As a footballer, Jan Pruijn only played amateur football, playing in the Hoofdklasse the 2nd highest league of amateur football in the Netherlands. In 1985, he became the coach of De Treffers from Groesbeek, with whom he won the championship in the Zondag Hoofdklasse C league three times, also winning the championship of the whole amateur league once. Between 1991 and 1994 he was the coach of N.E.C., being promoted to the Eredivisie and making it to the final of the KNVB Cup in 1994. Jan Pruijn then managed De Treffers for one more year, followed by a season as manager for Helmond Sport. After this coaching period, he became a football consultant for clubs such as Urawa Red Diamonds, Real Sociedad, FC Porto and FC Basel, and a couple of clubs from England. He opened up youth camps in the United States, and was youth coach in various countries, coaching at Lebanese football clubs, Dutch clubs, AFC Ajax, VV Venray and Al Ain FC. In 1999, he was employed by AFC Ajax as the manager of the international youth system, working with the academies in Ghana, Belgium and South Africa. In 2008, he succeeded Hans Vonk as the technical director at Ajax Cape Town. In October 2009 he was briefly the interim manager for Ajax Cape Town following a brief interim stint by Muhsin Ertuğral. Jan Pruijn was relieved at the Cape club by Foppe de Haan, to whom Jan would become the assistant, leading Ajax CT to second place in the South African PSL that season. In late 2012, Jan Pruijn occupied another interim coaching position at Ajax CT, succeeding Wilfred Mugeyi's interim position, following the dismissal of Maarten Stekelenburg as coach of Ajax Cape Town. He was relieved by Jan Versleijen who took over as interim coach, before resigning prematurely, and Muhsin Ertuğral finishing the season with Ajax CT after being appointed Technical director of the Cape club.

History Atoms for Peace first performed \\"Judge, Jury and Executioner\\" on their U.S. tour in October 2009 and April 2010. It was released as a download on January 7, 2013, after its broadcast on BBC Radio 1. Fans who pre-ordered the album could download the song free. A music video by Tarik Barri was released simultaneously. The limited vinyl version of the single, with an accompanying b-side \\"S.A.D.\\" was released on March 19, 2012. A live video of the song, recorded at Fuji Rock Festival, was released on the Atoms for Peace website. The song shares its name with the subtitle of a Radiohead song, \\"Myxomatosis\\", released on the 2003 album Hail to the Thief. Yorke said this was accidental, and that he had forgotten he had used the phrase before. Reception The song generally met with positive reviews, despite being likened to Yorke's other work. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone gave it 3.5 stars out of 5, praising \\"Yorke's swarming choral-style\\" and Flea's basslines, which he described as \\"a morph between Flea's instrument and Yorke's humming\\". Daniel Kreps of Spin depicted the earlier version of the song as \\"a dark, aggressive centerpiece among the post-Eraser material\\", whereas the final version was \\"mellower and more harmonious\\". Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post wrote that the song, like Atoms for Peace, is \\"a sonic extension of Radiohead\\". David Greenwald of Billboard described the song as \\"a blend of acoustic and electronic instrumentation, with Yorke's voice floating over wordless background vocals and insistent percussion\\".

A cryotank or cryogenic tank is a tank that is used to store material at very low temperatures. The term \\"cryotank\\" refers to storage of super-cold fuels, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Cryotanks and cryogenics can be seen in many sci-fi movies, but they are still currently undeveloped. All that needs to be done is for a human to be loaded into the tank and then they can be frozen until a time comes when any diseases they have can be cured and they can live an even longer life. This could also be used in space travel and just preserving human life in general. The problem with this is when the human body is frozen, ice crystals form in the cells. The ice crystals then continue to expand rupturing the cell wall and destroying the integrity of the cell, or killing it.You put antifreeze inside your car, so even though outside, everything can be frozen solid, but inside your car liquids still flow normally and so your car still runs. In the same way, glucose is an antifreeze for frogs and certain fish that their bodies could still be in liquid form with blood circulating even though they are frozen solid on the outside. This means in order for humans to undergo the cryogenic process a way to significantly raise the levels of glucose produced in the human body is needed.  Material Uses  Cryogenic tanks are used to store natural gases such as oxygen, argon, nitrogen, helium, hydrogen and other materials. Tanks can store the materials at the correct temperature and pressure for transportation. = In science fiction = In science fiction, cryogenic tanks are used to freeze people. cry- is a Greek prefix which means \\"cold or freezing\\", hence humans are stored in the tank frozen until a future date.

Originally a residential suburb, commercial uses became prominent during the 20th century, particularly along the St. Johns River and Riverside Avenue, and the area became included in Jacksonville's central business district. In the 21st century, it has become the site of mixed-use developments. Location Rapid redevelopment in Brooklyn has transformed once blighted areas of the neighborhood. Brooklyn is located along the St. Johns River, south of Lavilla and the Downtown Core, and immediately north of Riverside. It is roughly bounded by McCoy's Creek and the CSX Railroad lines to the north, the river to the east, and Interstate 95 to the south and west. Brooklyn has come to be considered part of Jacksonville's greater downtown. History The area was first settled in 1801, when Phillip Dell started a large 800-acre plantation there known as Dell's Bluff. Dell's Bluff changed hands several times before the American Civil War. After the war it was acquired by Miles Price, who sold the southern half of the property to be developed as the suburb of Riverside. The northern section he retained and developed himself as Brooklyn.Wood, pp. 105–107. It appears that Price gave Brooklyn its name, but it is not known why a former staunch Confederate would have chosen a name so associated with the New York borough of Brooklyn. Price's Brooklyn was initially a residential suburb, growing quickly with the establishment of a streetcar line. The area held a population of 1,000 and a few hundred homes and mansions. African-American former soldiers (known as Buffalo Soldiers) lived in the neighborhood, and one of their houses still stands, though in disrepair. In 1887 Brooklyn and several other suburbs were annexed by Jacksonville. It remained primarily residential into the 20th century, but it eventually developed into a commercial and industrial area with the increasing use of the railway. In the 1950s, Interstate 95 over the Fuller Warren Bridge cut off the historically black neighborhood. In the late 20th century, a number of commercial skyscrapers and other building were constructed along the river and Riverside Avenue. Subsequently, a rift emerged between the office-centered part of the neighborhood on the river and the traditional neighborhood further inland. As such, the city developed plans in the late 20th and early 21st century to reintroduce residential zoning and mixed-use development. Gentrification is affecting the long-term residents of Brooklyn.

The complex documentation relating to the series of transactions included provisions relating to: :* credit default swap agreements, :* consequential reduction of the principal amount upon certain specified \\"Credit Events\\" :* claims of LBSF and the Noteholders were limited to the collateral amount, and there was no right of recourse against the issuer :* the respective priorities of LBSF and the Noteholders in the \\"Event of Default\\" or otherwise (ie, LBSF had priority in the first case, and the Noteholders would have it in the second, and the clause was referred to as \\"the Flip\\") A group of 29 Australian investors, headed by Belmont, instructed BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd, the trustee for several of the notes in question, to have the issuer of the notes cancel the swap agreement. The Belmont group, together with Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd (another noteholder) launched claims against BNY to realise upon the collateral over any priority held by LBSF under the agreement. LBSF was joined as a party to the action. The courts below In July 2009, the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice found that:Perpetual Trustee (EWHC 2009), par. 4549 :* the contractual provisions were effective as a matter of English law and, in particular, did not offend the anti-deprivation rule as stated in British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France; :* alternatively, if the provisions were capable of offending the anti-deprivation rule, the rule was not engaged because an alternative Event of Default (the Chapter 11 filing by LBHI) had occurred prior to the Chapter 11 filing by LBSF, and consequently the Chapter 11 filing did not deprive LBSF of any property The ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in August 2009. In discussing the nature of the anti-deprivation rule, Neuberger MR (as he then was) observed:Perpetual Trustee (EWCA 2009), par. 5358 #the rule is based on public policy, but only to the extent that one cannot contract out of the insolvency legislation #where the rule is invoked, it is essential to begin from the elementary proposition that insolvency law is statutory and primacy must be given to the relevant statutory text #when considering whether the rule applies to a particular provision, there is, at least in principle, no difference between cases where the provision is expressed to apply on insolvency or liquidation and those where it is not so expressed #the courts should not extend the rule beyond its present limits, especially following the passage of the Insolvency Act 1986, save where logic or practicality otherwise require #judicial decisions in the insolvency field should ensure that the law is clear and consistent The Supreme Court granted permission to appeal. At the Supreme Court The Court of Appeal's decision was upheld by the Supreme Court. In so doing, Lord Collins in his speech discussed how the anti-deprivation and pari passu rules were designed to address different mischiefs,Belmont Park (UKSC 2011), par. 115 and how the first rule does possess limits in its application: #in borderline cases, a commercially sensible transaction entered into in good faith should not be held to infringe the ruleBelmont Park (UKSC 2011), par. 7479 #it does not apply if the deprivation takes place for reasons other than bankruptcyBelmont Park (UKSC 2011), par. 8083 #there is a distinction between a \\"flawed asset\\" (where an interest is always subject to the condition of the counterparty not going into insolvency) and an interest which is granted outright and then forfeited at the onset of bankruptcy, but it remains unclear where the line between the two is or ought to be drawn, and there is no case where the rule can be said to be generally applicable to either instanceBelmont Park (UKSC 2011), par. 8491 #the rule only applies where the bankrupt's own property is in issueBelmont Park (UKSC 2011), par. 9298 While all justices agreed that the appeal should be dismissed, Lord Mance did not rely on the \\"flawed asset\\" theory, instead finding that, prior to an event of default under the swap, neither the Noteholders nor LBSF had priority over the collateral proceeds. Once the event occurred, the priority would be determined under the swap's terms, and the Flip did not contravene the rule.Belmont Park (UKSC 2011), par. 168 In discussing applicable principles, Lord Mance observed that the pari passu rule addresses what happens in bankruptcy, and the anti-deprivation rule addresses what happens on bankruptcy. While conceptually distinct, they are quite closely allied.Belmont Park (UKSC 2011), par. 149 He also provided a three-part test in order to determine what might constitute deprivation: Impact The Court of Appeal believed that the current statutory régime embodied in the 1986 Act provided a comprehensive scheme, and the purpose of the common law could only be to reinforce and back up the statutory rules. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the anti-deprivation rule still had a valid place in English jurisprudence. As Lord Collins noted: The Court also expressed its preference for objective analysis of what is the actual content of commercial arrangements that have been entered into: The point that commercially sensible transactions entered into in good faith should not be lightly set aside is consistent with recent decisions of the Supreme Court and its predecessor the House of Lords concerning taking a purposive interpretation of contracts in order to uphold the parties’ intentions as far as possible. Other notable cases in that regard include Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd and Re Sigma Finance Corporation. Belmont Park was closely watched by The Football League, as it had great implications concerning the validity of its football creditors rule which requires that debts to other clubs or players are prioritised and must be paid in full before the club is eligible to compete again in the League. The Football Association Premier League Limited intervened in the Belmont Park appeal for that reason, and had postponed its own litigation in that regard until the disposition of that case. In 2012, the Chancery Division ruled that the football creditor rule was valid, and did not violate either the anti-deprivation rule or the pari passu rule. In his judgment, Richards J, relying on Belmont Park, declared: :* the anti-deprivation rule applies from the commencement of administration :* the pari passu principle comes into play only if the purpose of the insolvency procedure is to effect a distribution :* if a transaction has the effect of depriving a company of an asset in order to distribute it among some only of the creditors otherwise eligible to participate in a distribution, it offends both principles :* if the deprivation occurs on the company going into administration, only the anti-deprivation principle will be engaged See also *UK insolvency law ReferencesFurther reading  United Kingdom insolvency case law Supreme Court of the United Kingdom cases 2011 in case law 2011 in British law Lehman Brothers ","title":"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd"},{"id":"38657705","text":"Iwa is a village development committee in the Himalayas of Terhathum District in the Kosi Zone of eastern Nepal.

Racing during the 1950s, he and another British chaser, Galloway Braes, had a competitive rivalry and were extremely popular with racing fans.  Breeding  Halloween was born in 1945 and had fairly undistinguished breeding. His sire, Court Nez, was a descendant of leading sire Dark Ronald and his dam, My Blue Heaven, was a granddaughter of 1925 St Leger winner Solario. Halloween was a small brown gelding with a white star on his forehead.  Racing career = Early career = Halloween was bought by Captain R. B. Smalley for £90 and ridden by him in point to points. In 1951, he was transferred to hunter chases and put into training with Bill Wightman. Ridden by Smalley, Halloween recorded five victories from as many starts in the spring of that year. He made his debut at Windsor, where he won the three-mile Foxhunters Trial Chase by three lengths. He then won three races at Sandown and Worcester by five, six, and eight lengths before winning the Foxhunters Challenge Cup at the Cheltenham Festival. After his victory, Halloween was sold to Contessa di Sant Elia for £8000. He was considered champion hunter-chaser for the year 1950/51. = 1951/52 Season = Halloween was switched to chasing in the autumn of 1951, where he was expected to continue his progression. However, he was a quirky individual and did not respond well to his new jockeys. In his first two races at Hurst and Newbury, he unseated both Dick Francis and D. Dartnall before he was reunited with Captain Smalley, who knew how to ride the horse effectively. Halloween and Smalley won two chases for amateur riders before Wightman offered the ride to Fred Winter. Winter consulted with Smalley and realised that Halloween hated being pushed about by his jockey. With that in mind, Winter left Halloween to make his own running, and the pair won the Hurst Park Grand National Trial by eight lengths. As Winter clearly understood the horse, Wightman offered him a retainer of £250 to ride Halloween. = 1952/53 Season = The partnership of Halloween and Winter brought instant success the following season. Showing marked improvement, Halloween started his campaign by defeating the top-class chaser Galloway Braes by ten lengths in the Grand Sefton Trial at Hurst Park. He followed up that victory with a win in the Cottage Rake Handicap Chase at Kempton a month later, beating Air Wedding by four lengths. That triumph acted as a trial for the prestigious King George VI Chase at Kempton in late December. The field also contained Mont Tremblant (the winner of the 1952 Cheltenham Gold Cup, the extremely versatile Irish chaser Knock Hard, Galloway Braes, Teal (winner of the 1952 Grand National), and top novice chaser Wenceslaus, amongst others. The field went round at a good gallop, with Galloway Braes taking the lead at the eighth fence. Although Halloween made up ground on the final bend, Mont Tremblant looked sure to win approaching the final fence. However, an excellent leap by Halloween saw him go a length up, and although Mont Tremblant battled back, he couldn’t regain the lead. Halloween prepped for the Cheltenham Gold Cup in the Herne the Hunter Handicap Chase at Windsor, where he conceded 2 stone 2 lbs in weight to Air Wedding and beat him by three quarters of a length. The Gold Cup featured many horses from the King George as well as E.S.B., who went on to win the infamous 1956 renewal of the Grand National. Halloween was dwarfed by his larger rivals in the ring but finished second, beaten five lengths, to Knock Hard. Halloween passed Galloway Braes on the run in and ‘looked like he could go round again’. = 1953/54 Season = Jockey Fred Winter broke his leg and was out of action for most of the year. Deprived of the rider who knew him best, Halloween won only his debut, beating former Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Cottage Rake (then a 14-year-old) over two miles at Wincanton. Halloween then finished second to Stormhead (well beaten in the previous year’s King George) in the Emblem Chase at Manchester, fourth to old rival Galloway Braes (who posted a record-breaking victory) in the King George, and third to Mont Tremblant in the Grand International Chase at Sandown. In the Cheltenham Gold Cup, he was third to Four Ten and Mariners Log after finishing well. Halloween ran three more times that season in the Sussex Chase (second to Gay Donald while conceding over a stone), Welsh Grand National (fourth under M. Scudamore) and the prestigious Queen Elizabeth Steeplechase at Hurst Park, where Galloway Braes recorded his second consecutive win in the race and ran the fastest three-mile-chase ever recorded. = 1954/55 Season = The autumn saw Halloween reunited with Fred Winter. After a second in the Grand Sefton Trial Handicap, the pair won the Charlton Park Handicap Chase at Cheltenham and the Ewell Chase at Sandown. Up against a good field in the King George, including favoured Galloway Braes, Gold Cup second Mariner’s Log, and prolific-winning chaser Crudwell, Halloween won, beating Galloway Braes by six lengths. In the process, he became the first horse to win two renewals of the King George. Halloween confirmed the form with Galloway Braes in the Coventry Handicap Chase (a forerunner to the BetBright Chase) the following month, before making a third attempt at the Gold Cup. Rated the second favourite, Halloween finished second to the outsider Gay Donald, who built up a commanding lead from the start to win by ten lengths.http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/18th-march-1955/7/that- blessed-horse His final run of the season came in the Queen Elizabeth Chase, where both he and rival Galloway Braes ran below form behind Limb Of Law. = 1955/56 Season = Halloween had a truncated season after injuring himself in the Cottage Rake Handicap when a head second to Pointsman, and missing the King George. He was second and third in two races at Sandown and Newbury, giving three stone to the winner in the latter, before running in the Gold Cup for the fourth time. Although he looked well and on his toes in the paddock, Halloween finished third behind Limber Hill. = 1956/57 Season = Halloween ran only twice more, finishing second in the Bury Steeplechase at Fontwell and third behind 1953 Grand National winner Early Mist in the Brocas Chase at Windsor.  Retirement  After his loss at Windsor, Halloween was found to be suffering from heart problems and was subsequently retired. His longterm rival Galloway Braes was killed when falling in that year’s King George, and Gold Cup winner Limber Hill broke down and never ran again.

It established 12 Area Gas Boards to own and operate all public gas making, distribution and sales facilities and created a central authority: the Gas Council. It vested the existing local authority and company owned gas undertakings into the Area Boards with effect from 1 May 1949. The Gas Act 1948 was one of a number of Acts promulgated by the post-war Labour government to nationalise elements of the UK's industrial infrastructure; other Acts include the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946; the Electricity Act 1947; Transport Act 1947 (railways and long-distance road haulage); and the Iron and Steel Act 1949.  Background  Prior to nationalisation of the gas industry there were about 1,064 gas supply undertakings in Britain; about one-third were municipal local authority undertakings and about two-thirds were company undertakings. In June 1944 the Minister of Fuel and Power appointed a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of Geoffrey Heyworth to review the structure and organisation of the industry and to advise on changes to develop and cheapen gas supplies. The Committee reported in November 1945: The Gas Industry: Report of the Committee of Inquiry Cmd.6699. It recommended the compulsory purchase by the Government of all gas undertakings and the creation of ten regional gas boards. The Heyworth Committee report formed the basis of the Gas Bill 1948.  The Gas Act 1948  The Gas Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 22 January 1948 by Hugh Gaitskell the Minister of Fuel and Power. The Committee stage of the Bill was prolonged including a session of 51 hours. The Gas Act 1948 received Royal Assent in July 1948. Its long title is: ‘An Act to provide for the establishment of Area Gas Boards and a Gas Council and for the exercise and performance by those Boards and that Council of functions relating to the supply of gas and coke and certain other matters; for the transfer to such Boards as aforesaid and to the said Council of property, rights, obligations and liabilities of gas undertakers and other persons; for co-ordinating the activities of Area Gas Boards and the National Coal Board relating to carbonization; to amend the law relating to the supply of gas; to make certain consequential provision as to Income Tax; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid’.Gas Act 1948 = Provisions = Part 1 of Gas Act 1948 defined the way in which the industry was to be run. It specifically placed authority in the Area Boards, which were autonomous. Area Boards were charged with the three duties: # To develop and maintain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply for their areas and to satisfy, so far as it is economic to do so, all reasonable demands for gas within their area. # To develop and maintain the efficient, co-ordinated and economical production of coke, other than metallurgical coke. # To develop and maintain efficient methods of recovering by-products obtained in the process of manufacturing gas. Part 2 of the Act defined the assets to be acquired and how they were to be paid for. The Heyworth committee had recommended ten Area Boards, however the Act included Scotland and Wales making 12 Boards. Section 9 established Consultative Councils for each Area Board. They were charged with considering any matter affecting the supply of gas in the area; and of considering and reporting to the Area Board any such matter. Each council had between 20 and 30 members. Some members were appointed as representatives of local authorities and some as representatives of commerce, industry, labour and other interests.North Thames Gas Consultative Council, Annual Report, 1972 Section 22 defined the Gas Council's formal responsibilities: # to advise the Minister in questions affecting the gas industry and matters relating thereto; # to promote and assist the efficient exercise and performance by Area Boards of their function. Section 51 required the gas industry to consult with the Coal Board to coordinate the operation of coke ovens which were owned and operated by collieries but which supplied the gas industry with gas. Section 55 empowered the Minister to define the standards of the gas supplied including its pressure, calorific value and composition. Section 62 empowered the Gas Council to take over the industry's existing bodies such as the British Gas Council and the Association of Gas Corporations. Schedule 4 repealed all previous irrelevant enactments relating to the gas industry, the 1948 Act itself became the new legal basis.  Later enactments  The Gas Act 1960 (8 & 9 Eliz. 2 c. 27) increased the Gas Council's borrowing powers to £500 million. The Gas Act 1965 (1965 c. 36) increased the Council's borrowing powers to £1,200 million; it also allowed it to manufacture or acquire gas and supply gas in bulk to Area Boards. The new powers allowed it to enter joint ventures with other corporations. For example, with Amoco to explore and exploit natural gas fields in parts of the Southern North Sea. The Gas Act 1972 (1972 c. 60) repealed the Gas Act 1948 and the Gas Act 1960. The 1972 Act established the British Gas Corporation to centralise control and operation of the industry. With effect from 1 January 1973 the Area Boards were made regions of the British Gas Corporation and the Gas Council was abolished.

It established the British Gas Corporation to exercise full responsibility for the oversight, control and operation of the gas industry. The twelve autonomous Area Gas Boards which had managed the industry in their areas now became regions of the British Gas Corporation. The Gas Council, also established under the Gas Act 1948, was abolished and the Gas Act 1948 was repealed. The provisions of the Act came into force on 1 January 1973.  Background  The principal role of the twelve Area Gas Boards, established under the Gas Act 1948, was to maintain a supply of gas to match the demand. This was through the operation of local gas works manufacturing gas by coal carbonisation or catalytic reforming of refinery light-end products such as methane, naphtha or light oils. The advent of natural gas from the North Sea, first landed onshore in 1967, shifted the concerns about supply from an area to a national basis. Gas was now fed to an area rather than being manufactured within the area. In 1969 the Government recognised that to fully exploit the benefits of North Sea Gas a radical reorganisation of the industry was needed with increased central power. A Bill to realise these changes was introduced in Parliament by the Labour Government in November 1969. However, this Bill failed when Parliament was dissolved for the May 1970 general election. The Conservative Government introduced a new Bill in Parliament in January 1972 to put full responsibility for the gas industry into a new statutory body the British Gas Corporation.  The Gas Act 1972.  The Gas Act 1972 (1972 chapter 60) received Royal Assent on 9 August 1972. Its long title is: ‘An Act to make fresh provision with respect to the gas industry in Great Britain and related matters, and for purposes connected therewith’. = Provisions = The Act had 50 Sections in 4 Parts, plus 8 Schedules Part I defined a new structure for British gas industry. This included the establishment of the British Gas Corporation, its duties and powers, programmes for substantial capital outlay, and the powers of, and reports to, the Secretary of State. It established consumers' bodies such as the National Gas Consumers' Council and the Regional Gas Consumers' Councils, and defined their functions and local representation. The BGC had a specific duty ‘to develop and maintain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply for Great Britain and to satisfy, so far as is economical to do so, all reasonable demands for gas in Great Britain’. Part II established financial provisions, including the general financial duties of British Gas Corporation, the borrowing powers of the BGC, the issue of British Gas Stock, keeping of accounts and audits. Part III established provisions for the supply and use of gas. This included methods of charge and tariffs, standards of quality, the Gas Supply Code (Schedule 4), restrictions on supply by persons other than the Corporation, and related provisions. It also defined meter testing and stamping and the power to make safety regulations. Part IV Defined the position of the BGC with respect of taxation, pension rights, penalties, prosecutions, and offences by corporations, and establishment of inquiries. Schedule 8 defined statute repeals.  Later Enactments  The Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, amended and repealed certain sections of the 1972 Act. The Gas Act 1986, which privatised the gas industry, repealed further sections of the 1972 Act.

It existed from 1848 to 1867, and functioned as the capital of an autonomous region until the S.A.R. Volksraad was established, when the outpost came under the supervision and regulations of the central government. The settlement was evacuated after only thirty years when attacked by Venda militants. The government rendered indecisive support and the town as torched by Katze-Katze on the night of 15 July 1867. After the S.A.R. reestablished control over the area in 1898, the former settlement was ignored and a new one started, at the present Louis Trichardt. Consequently Schoemansdal was the only Voortrekker settlement not to evolve into a modern town. The archaeological site with traces of the former settlement is currently state property and access is controlled. It is situated on the north bank of the Dorps River at 552 m.a.s.l., near present- day Hamantsha and Tshiozwi townships and the Schoemansdal railway siding. Early Voortrekkers The earliest western visitors to the area after the renegade Coenraad de Buys, were the Voortrekker parties led by Hans van Rensburg and Louis Tregardt. They arrived separately at the Zoutpansberg in 1836, after parting ways over an earlier disagreement. Van Rensburg headed east towards Inhambane but his entire party was exterminated en route. Tregardt stayed at the Salt Pan from May to August 1836 and arrived at the site of future Schoemansdal on 3 November 1836. They stayed about two weeks, but resided in the general vicinity for more than a year. After reconnaissance missions into the current Zimbabwe and eastwards into current Mozambique in search of the Van Rensburg clan, they made Delagoa Bay their destination, away from British influence. They started on their epic journey in September 1837 and reached Delagoa Bay seven months later. The trek exacted a high toll; 27 of 53 persons perished from malaria, including Tregardt. Zoutpansbergdorp Eleven years after Tregardt's departure, a settlement named Oude Dorp was established at Tregardt's earlier camp. It was founded by field cornet Jan Valentyn Botha who led a faction of Andries Potgieter's trek, consisting of about 48 families. When their wagon train arrived on 2 May 1848 from Andries- Ohrigstad, they immediately constructed an earthen redoubt (or schans) and reed-huts (or scherms). Potgieter, who headed the earlier reconnaissance mission over the Limpopo river, arrived subsequently from Ohrigstad where his followers were being decimated by malaria. He was of the opinion that the Zoutpansberg was sufficiently distant from British influence to afford the possibility of independence, and chose the location as the capital of his republic. The town was henceforth named Zoutpansberg(dorp). The settlement had a promising start. Portuguese traders opened trading stores and the ivory trade blossomed. Rice and wheat croplands, fruit orchards and coffee plantations were established. The town also traded in salt, game and ostrich skins, ostrich feathers, animal horns and wood. Wood used for trading or construction included yellowwood, Cape teak, tamboti and beech wood. Potgieter enjoyed independence in this northern outpost and ruled over extensive territory. He and his followers opposed the notion of a Volksraad for the Overvaal region, besides any relations with Cape colonial authorities. In 1849 the Voortrekker faction led by J. J. Burger that remained in Ohrigstad (and subsequently Lydenburg) engaged in a series of negotiations with the faction headed by Andries Pretorius in Potchefstroom. After meetings at Hekpoort, Olifants River and Derdepoort respectively, an Overvaal Volksraad was constituted. Potgieter at first refused to accept its authority but relented when faced with an embargo. Potgieter rendered no assistance to the Transoranje Voortrekkers when their republic was annexed by Britain in 1848. He died at Zoutpansbergdorp in 1852, months after Andries Pretorius negotiated the independence of the Overvaal with British authorities. He left his son, cmdt.genl. Piet Potgieter, in charge of the town. The leader of Zoutpansbergdorp, Piet Potgieter, dies at Makapansgat when hit by a sniper bullet. Stephanus Schoeman In September 1854 Piet's uncle, field cornet Hermanus Potgieter (Groot Hermaans), was searching for ivory near the Nyl River, an area ruled by chiefs Makapan and Mankopane (also: Mapela or Mapele). For reasons imperfectly known, the chiefs decided to massacre them and other unrelated white travellers. The act claimed the lives of 28 white settlers, and the Potchefstroom governance authorized a punitive commando under the command of Piet Potgieter and M. W. Pretorius. The tribesmen retreated into Makapansgat cave, where they were to suffer heavy casualties. One of their snipers however managed to fatally shoot Piet Potgieter. This was the only Boer casualty of the campaign, but his death brought an end to the Potgieters' hegemony in the north. Schoemansdal The Potgieters' passing was followed by a number of local disputes, until by 1855, the town's de facto leader was cmdt.genl. Stephanus Schoeman. He renamed the growing, though disorderly reed- hut settlement Schoemansdal, after himself, had it surveyed and divided into equal erven. Augmented by renegades, the town was now a successful ivory trading centre, and its population numbered a few hundred (1,800 according to one estimate). During this year it was also visited by Deocleciano Das Neves and Pastor Joaquim de S. R. Montanha from Portuguese ports on the east coast. Reverends Andrew Murray, J. H. Neethling, Piet Huet and Dirk van der Hoff were visiting clergy before a permanent minister took residence. With the arrival of a resident minister, reverend N. J. van Warmelo in 1864, and that of the first teacher, Cornelia van Boeschoten in 1866, the community had an air of permanence. In addition Joao Albasini, Augusto Carvalho, Cassimiro Simmoens and Dietlof Maré had established shops in the town. Besides reed huts, there were now some structures of raw or burnt clay bricks which indicated that their owners were determined to settle permanently. The church building was the first of its kind in the Zoutpansberg, and during the week it served as the school building. The parsonage was a high quality building, which was initially built to house Schoeman. Professional medical services were however unavailable, and the residents relied on home remedies. Many died of yellow fever or malaria. Over-hunting had a devastating effect on the animal populations and the Pretoria government reacted in 1858 by placing limits on the trade in animal products. This was hardly enforceable as the town had become a refuge for increasingly lawless ivory hunters and traders. Arms smuggling was rampant and at one point 30 tons of lead was imported for manufacturing of bullets. Venda hunters, or so-called swart skuts, supplied the Voortrekkers with ivory and were in turn supplied with firearms. Relations between the Voortrekkers and Venda soured owing to taxation (called opgaaf), cattle rustling and lax control over firearms. Hostilities and demise Total discord broke out in 1866, after the Voortrekkers had intervened in khosi Ramabulana's succession dispute, and one claimant, his youngest son Makhado (also: Makhato or Magato), attacked and torched an outlying Voortrekker settlement. The town residents moved to the redoubt at the center of town for safety. The next year Paul Kruger was sent from Pretoria with some 400 to 500 men to restore law and order. Discipline in the ranks of Kruger's relief commando was however poor and they were furnished with very limited ammunition. On reaching Schoemansdal, which was under threat by chief Katze- Katze (also: Katlakter), Kruger and his officers resolved that holding the town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation. The Voortrekkers abandoned the town on 15 July 1867 and established Pietersburg. Following its abandonment Katze-Katze razed the town. The loss of Schoemansdal, once a prosperous settlement by Boer standards, was considered a great humiliation by many burghers. The Transvaal government formally exonerated Kruger over the matter, ruling that he had been forced to evacuate Schoemansdal by factors beyond his control, but some still argued that he had given the town up too readily. Peace returned to Zoutpansberg in 1869, following the intervention of the republic's Swazi allies. After its razing, Schoemansdal was never rebuilt and all that remained was its graveyard,Op Pad in Suid-Afrika. B. P. J. Erasmus, 1995, irrigation systems and roads. LayoutFirst settlement A hartbeeshuis dwelling, made from poles, laths and reeds. Families in the first settlement, Zoutpansbergdorp, lived exclusively in \\"hartbeeshuise\\" (etymology perhaps \\"hard-reed house\\"), which were elongate, pitched-roof shelters built directly on the ground, with or without internal partitions. These were constructed of wooden poles and laths, with the spaces between the laths plastered over or filled in with reeds, which were obtained from a large reed marsh in the Dorps River. Pastor Joaquim de S. R. Montanha who visited the settlement in 1855 on behalf of the governor in Inhambane reported that some small houses were occupied by more than one, or even several families. Windows were merely holes above the reed door, which according to Montanha were closed off with hessian fabric. Second settlement Construction of a second redoubt preceded the town of Schoeman's day. It was constructed of raw and burnt clay bricks, with cannons stationed on two bastions and loopholes in the walls. The subsequent market square, parsonage and church were in its immediate vicinity. Das Neves estimated that there were never more than 70 houses, though excavations at the site suggest a higher number. The town had a rectangular layout and all erven were of the same size. Fountain and stream water was channeled to town in two furrows, one of them long. Recent developments The Transvaal Provincial Museum Service began excavations in 1985. Reports of the partial excavations are housed in the museum offices at Louis Trichardt. During 1989 experimental reconstructions were made of some shelters, to the south of the archaeological site. An open-air museum was established which managed an area of 600 ha, but its information centre burnt down in 2008, and some irreplaceable items were lost.

This legislation would be replacing the British Gas Corporation (government or state ownership) with British Gas plc (private ownership). The Act also established a licensing regime, a Gas Consumers’ Council, and a regulator for the industry called the Office of Gas Supply (OFGAS).  Background  The liberalization and privatization of the energy markets in the United Kingdom began with Margaret Thatcher’s Government in the 1980s. This has been called the Thatcher-Lawson agenda, due to the key role of Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1983–1989) in the Thatcher cabinet. There was a perceived need to reduce the inefficient state control of the energy sector and to introduce a market-oriented system through privatization. Access to the energy market would be given to more organizations, improving competition and reducing prices for the consumer.  Gas Act 1986  The Gas Act 1986 received royal assent on 25 July 1986. The long title of the Act is: = Provisions = The provisions of the Act comprise 68 sections in three parts, plus eight schedules. * Part I: Gas supply ** Sections 1 to 4: Introductory – the Director-General of Gas Supply, the Gas Consumers’ Council ** Sections 5 to 8: Authorization of gas supply – authorization of public gas suppliers, authorization of other persons ** Sections 9 to 15: Supply of gas by public gas suppliers – general powers and duties, fixing of tariffs, public gas supply code ** Sections 16 to 18: Supply of gas by public gas suppliers and others – quality standards, safety regulations ** Sections 19 to 22: Use by other persons of pipe-lines belonging to public gas suppliers – acquisition of rights to use pipe-lines, construction of pipe-lines, increasing capacity of pipe-lines ** Sections 23 to 27: Modification of public gas suppliers’ authorizations ** Sections 28 to 30: Securing compliance of public gas suppliers ** Sections 31 to 33: Investigation of complaints – the duties of the Director-General of Gas Supply and the Gas Consumers’ Council to investigate certain matters ** Sections 34 to 39: Other functions of the Director-General of Gas Supply – general functions, the publication of information and advice, annual and other reports ** Sections 40 to 41: Other functions of the Gas Consumers’ Council – the duty to advise the Director-General of Gas Supply, annual reports ** Sections 42 to 44: Miscellaneous ** Sections 45 to 48: Supplemental * Part II: Transfer of the undertakings of the British Gas Corporation ** Sections 49 to 61: Vesting of property of British Gas Corporation, British Gas plc stock, government holding in the successor company, dissolution of the British Gas Corporation * Part III: Miscellaneous and general ** Sections 62 to 68: Financial provisions, general interpretation, amendments, transitional provisions, savings and repeals, commencement and extent of Schedules 1 to 9 = Effects of the Act = The Gas Act of 1986 repealed the whole of the Gas Act 1960, and parts of the Gas Act 1965, as well as parts of the Gas Act 1972. Section 1 of the 1986 Act established the Director-General of Gas Supply and the Office of Gas Regulation (OFGAS). This was an economic regulator, independent of Government but accountable to Parliament. This arrangement separated the regulatory decisions from political control and aimed to give greater long- term regulatory certainty and to encourage market entry and investment. The regulator has since become the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM). The Gas Act 1986 was one of the first Thatcher government privatization efforts. The first had been British Telecom in 1984. When British Gas plc was floated on the London Stock Exchange on 8 December 1986, it traded at 135 pence per share, valuing British Gas plc at £9 billion. The privatization of gas supply and the opening up of the market was one of the factors in the UK's 'Dash for Gas' – the shift from coal-fired to gas-fired power plants in the electricity industry – in the early 1990s. Other factors included regulatory changes by the EU that facilitated the use of gas, technological advances that increased the efficiency of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT), increased North Sea gas production, and the environmental benefits of reduced carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions. In 1994, British Gas plc was reorganized into British Gas and Transco. British Gas owned the offshore supplies, storage, and supply contracts. The onshore pipeline system, the National Transmission System (NTS), was independently operated by Transco. In preparation for the further opening up of the gas markets to competition in 1996, British Gas plc went through a process of restructuring to separate the company into five new divisions, which entailed a substantial reduction of staff. The Gas Act of 1986 does not apply to Northern Ireland.  Later amending Acts  The Gas Act 1995 amended Parts I and III of the Gas Act 1986, establishing provisions for requiring the owners of certain gas processing facilities to make them available to other organizations. Section 1 of the Utilities Act 2000 established the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), which merged and abolished the Office of Gas Supply (OFGAS) and Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER).

She is a prominent contemporary theoretical and critical figure in Slovenia. Since 1993 she is employed at the Institute of Philosophy at the Scientific and Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Science and Arts (short ZRC-SAZU in Slovenian and SRC-SASA in English). Today, she serves as a professor and research adviser. For her scientific work, she has received the Golden SASA sign in 2007. Since 2003, she has also served as Full Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, Austria. She publishes extensively, lectures worldwide, and is involved in video art since 1982.  Early life and education  Marina Gržinić was born in 1958 in Rijeka (Yugoslavia), in present-day Croatia. She was raised in an Italian minority family. She moved alone to Ljubljana at the age of seventeen (after completing her gymnasium studies in Rijeka). She received her Bachelor of Arts in analytical sociology in 1985, completed her Master of Arts in 1991 at the Faculty of Arts in Slovenia, and received her doctoral title in 1995 from the Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana. The title of her dissertation was Virtual Reality: Achronic Time, Paraspace and Simulation. Gržinić was one of the first, if not the first in Slovenia and maybe ex- Yugoslavia, with a doctorate in philosophy and virtual reality, cyberspace, cyberfeminism (Haraway), postcolonial theory (Trinh T. Minh-ha), French structuralism and media theory (Baudrillard, Couchot, Klonaris/Thomadaki, Virilio, etc.).http://www.obn.org/obn_pro/downloads/reader2.pdf In the period from 1997 to 1998 she completed her postdoctoral academic training in Japan, at the University of Tokyo (she received the Japan government grant, JSPS) and spent a year with Professor Machiko Kusahara.  Career  In Ljubljana, she engaged in the constitution of what is today known as the Ljubljana alternative or subcultural movement that, in the 1980s, developed new artistic practices,(like video and performance) politically engaged movements such as the homosexual gay and lesbian scene, and many other processes that were constitutive for the discussion of the position of art and culture in Slovenia in connection with demands and struggles for a political emancipated life that bypasses the middle class bourgeoisie perception of the Slovenian society and reality.http://www.spikeart.at/dropbox/Llubljana_1.pdf = Theory = Gržinić's theoretical work focuses on contemporary philosophy and aesthetics after modernism. Her work is directed towards a theory of ideology, theory of technology, biopolitics/necropolitics, video technology and transfeminism in connection with decolonialityhttp://pavilionmagazine.org/download/pavilion_14.pdf Gržinić's work cannot be easily circumscribed in this or that school or discipline, though in recent years,she's brought forward global critical philosophy, which is both daring and dangerously concrete in being alert, critical for the local, against racism, coloniality and globally questioning capitalism and necropolitics. It is important to highlight her theoretical approach that is between the politically performative theory and activist criticism and theory in action. This means that the Gržinić's position is not a disengaged area of interpretation that derives from theoretical and philosophical contemplation but that her work in philosophy, theory and arts derives from concrete theoretical practice and interventions and related cultures. She regularly implements her research results in the processes of education and as well in other disciplines, especially art disciplines, finally she engages significantly in the public life at home and abroad, being part of different struggles politically and socially motivated against capitalism and its processes of dispossession, racism, and brutal discrimination. = Art/video = Gržinić is active in video art and media art since 1982. She works in collaboration with Aina Šmid, art historian and artist from Ljubljana.

The river is one of the few notable streams that drain the right bank of the tidal Trent. The source of the river is near Harpswell, at the foot of the Lincolnshire Edge, and it joins the tidal River Trent at Susworth. Unlike other rivers that drain into the tidal Trent, there is no pumping station associated with the outfall, it relies on gravity to discharge during periods of tidal low water. The Eau flows through the village of Scotter, which has a history of being flooded by the river; the most recent occasion was in June 2007. The river is also important for the drainage of the flat low-lying agricultural land that surrounds it, with some 2000 hectares or 20 square kilometres (8 square miles) of the Gainsborough Internal Drainage Board district, relying on the Eau for this function. Whilst the drains that discharge into the Eau are maintained by the Drainage Board, the river is the responsibility of the Environment Agency being designated as a Main river.

Francis Juliet Hamersley Lewis Campbell (August 5, 1823 – December 26, 1898) was an American poet and novelist. Campbell was born in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, the eldest child of Judge Ellis Lewis (1798–1871), later Pennsylvania Attorney General and Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. She grew up in Towanda, Pennsylvania. She attended the Moravian Young Ladies' Seminary in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, beginning in 1835. In 1842 she married lawyer and future United States Representative James Hepburn Campbell. Campbell was a poet and her poems were included in several prominent anthologies. The American Female Poets (1848) by Caroline May included \\"Dreams\\", \\"A Confession\\", \\"Lines at Night\\", and \\"Tarpeia\\", The Female Poets of America (1849) by Rufus Wilmot Griswold included \\"Dreams\\", \\"Night-Blooming Flowers\\", and \\"A Story of Sunrise\\", and Read's Female Poets of America (1848) by Thomas Buchanan Read included \\"A Story of Sunrise\\" and \\"A Song of Sunset\\". In 1862, she published the long poem Legend of Infancy of Our Savior: A Christmas Carol. Campbell's only novel was Eros and Antieros; or, The Bachelor's Ward, published in 1857 under the name Judith Canute and published again the following year as The Old Love and the New under her own name. The hero of the novel, Arthur Walsingham, is a romantic poet and scholar in love with Viola, a woman married to his best friend. Viola and her husband die, leaving their daughter, also named Viola, in Walsingham's care. Much of the novel is dedicated to the younger Viola's upper class education, apparently intended to be an example for other women. When Viola is grown, she and Walsingham marry. The novel also extolls the virtues of the Susquehanna River and life in the vicinity of Lake Erie. Portraits of Campbell by Thomas Sully and John Henry Brown are owned by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

Its name derives from its capital, Eğriboz/Ağriboz, the Turkish form of Euripos, another name of Chalkis. In contemporary English sources it is usually known as Negropont after the Italian name for Chalkis and the island of Euboea, Negroponte. The sanjak was formed in 1471, after the Ottoman conquest of the Venetian colony of Negroponte (1470). Negroponte was joined with the territories taken from the recently (1456) conquered Duchy of Athens, which had until then been administered by the sanjakbey of Trikala, to form the new province, which encompassed all of eastern Continental Greece. According to the 17th-century geographer Hajji Khalifa, it was divided in ten districts (kazas): Eğriboz proper, encompassing central Euboea; Kizil Hissar (Karystos, in southern Euboea); Oderbos (Oreoi, in northern Euboea); Izdin/Zeitun (Zitouni, modern Lamia); Modunish (Mendenitsa); Talanda (Atalanti); Atina (Athens with most of Attica); Egina (Aigina); Istifa (Thebes); Esedabad (Tourkochori); Mestube; Rubus (Oropos); Kefsa (Kifissia); Megara. Early 19th-century sources report only nine: Eğriboz, Talanda, Livadya (Livadeia), Kizil Hissar, Salna (Salona, Amfissa), Izdin, Istifa, Athens, and Esedabad. However, the city of Athens itself was a personal property of the kizlar agha, the powerful Chief Black Eunuch of the Imperial Harem, and administered in his name by a voivode. Like all other provinces of southern Greece, from 1533 the sanjak was subordinated to the Eyalet of the Archipelago, under the chief admiral of the Ottoman Navy, the Kapudan Pasha. Most of the sanjak rose up in revolt during the early period of the Greek War of Independence, and the Greek rebels established a regional administration known as the Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece. Control of the region shifted between Greeks and Turks during the war, but Thebes remained in Ottoman hands and Euboea was held by the capable Omer Pasha of Kizil Hissar. The last Ottoman strongholds were surrendered to Greek control only in 1832–1833, after the Ottoman government recognized Greek independence.

Number one shows a base tunnel A base tunnel is a type of tunnel, mainly a railway tunnel, that is built through the base of a mountain pass. This type of tunnel typically connects two valleys at about the same altitudes. When originally constructed, classical railway lines through mountainous terrain tried to minimize tunneling, due to technical limitations and expense, and therefore required long and steep gradients and many curves, or even spirals. Tunnels were generally short and much higher up the mountain. Such tunnels are sometimes also called culmination tunnels, especially in the presence of a base tunnel through the same mountain massif. The base tunnels take the opposite approach, minimizing or eliminating gradients and curves with the consequence of having longer tunnels but shorter total distances to travel. This allows for higher speeds and lower energy costs.

After finishing fourth on his only appearance as a two-year-old, the colt was undefeated in three starts in 1833, winning the St Leger in the harlequin colours of Richard Watt and taking the Doncaster Cup against older horses in the same week. Rockingham remained in training for three further seasons, winning the 1835 Goodwood Cup, four King's Plates, and three consecutive renewals of the Brighton Gold Cup. He was retired from racing for a brief stud career, but had little success as a sire of winners. Background Rockingham was described (by his owners) as \\"a beautiful rich brown horse... 16 hand high, of great muscular power, bone and substance\\". The American Turf Register referred to him as being of \\"very remarkable size and symmetry\\", while the Sporting Magazine called him \\"as powerful as a coach-horse\\" with \\"all the activity of a \\"pony\\". He was bred at Malton in Yorkshire by William Allen (the breeder of the St Leger winner Rowton) and was the ninth live foal produced by the Irish-bred mare Medora, a descendant of Prunella's sister Peppermint. Rockingham was the only classic winner sired by Humphrey Clinker, a successful racehorse who was beginning to make an impact as a stallion when he died in 1834. Racing career=1832: two-year-old season= Originally racing in the colours of Mr Vansittart, Rockingham's racing career began on 20 September at the St Leger meeting at Doncaster Racecourse. He started at odds of 6/1 against eleven opponents in a sweepstakes for two-year-olds and finished fourth behind Belshazzar, a colt owned by Richard Watt. =1833: three-year-old season= Early in 1833 Rockingham was reportedly sold for 1,000 guineas to his trainer Richard Shepherd, of Langton Wold but by the time he ran again he was in the ownership of Richard Watt. The colt was not entered in The Derby, but by March he was already among the favourites for the St Leger. On 14 May, Rockingham made his first appearance as a three-year-old in \\"The Shorts\\", a one-mile sweepstakes at the York spring meeting. Ridden by Sam Darling, he won from Mr Orde's colt Dancing-master. He was not particularly impressive, but retained his position as a leading contender for the St Leger on the strength of reports from private trial races which had shown him to be superior to his stable companion Belshazzar. Rockingham was withdrawn from his engagement at the York August meeting, and did not reappear on the racecourse until he contested the St Leger at Doncaster on 17 September. In a field of twenty runners, he was the fifth choice in the betting at odds of 7/1, with Muley Moloch starting the 5/2 favourite ahead of Belshazzar on 3/1. With Darling again in the saddle, he was held up at the back of the field as Belshazzar set an unusually slow pace. Darling moved the colt gradually closer to the leaders in the straight, but appeared to be blocked behind the front rank of horses. A furlong from the finish, Darling found a gap for his horse, and Rockingham accelerated past Mr Walker's colt Mussulman to win very easily by two lengths. The unusually slow winning time and the fact that most of the runners finished closely grouped behind the winner led the Sporting Magazine to conclude that the race had been a sub-standard renewal of the classic. Two days after his win in the St Leger, Rockingham was matched against older horses in the Doncaster Cup over a distance of two miles, five furlongs. Ridden by T. Nicholson, he started favourite and won from his fellow three-year-old Revenge, with the five-year- old Consol in third. =1834: four-year-old season= Before the start of the 1834 season, Rockingham was sold for 1000 guineas to Mr Wall and then acquired by Mr Theobald who sent him to compete in the south of England. He made his first appearance in the two and a half mile Gold Cup at Ascot Racecourse on 12 June. He started a 12/1 outsider but finished strongly to be second of the ten runners behind the favourite Glaucus and there was some criticism of his jockey, Jem Chapple, who had given the colt a great deal of ground to make up in the closing stages. A week after his run at Ascot, Rockingham appeared at the Hampton and Molesey Hurst meeting near the border of Middlesex and Surrey. He ran in a King's Plate, a long-distance race run in a series of heats, with the prize going to the first horse to win twice. Rockingham won the first heat and was then able to walk over for the second after his three opponents were withdrawn. Five days later he claimed another King's Plate, winning in two two-mile heats at Guildford. On 31 July he appeared in the Gold Cup at Goodwood Racecourse where he finished unplaced behind the three-year-old Glencoe. Eight days later he ran in the Gold Cup at Brighton Racecourse and won at odds of 2/5 from his only opponent. On 13 August at Lewes he started favourite for a King's Plate but finished second in both heats to Famine, a three-year-old daughter of Humphrey Clinker, despite being ridden \\"very severely\\" by Chapple. Rockingham's last race of the season came at Canterbury on 27 August where he won his third King's Plate of the year by beating Captain Ricardo's six-year-old Vestris in two heats. =1835: five-year-old season= Rockingham began his 1835 campaign in the Goodwood Cup on 30 July. Ridden by Jem Robinson he started at odds of 5/1 and won from Glaucus and the 1832 Epsom Derby winner St. Giles. On the following afternoon he started favourite for a King's Plate over three miles five furlongs, but was beaten by a three-year-old colt named Lucifer, to whom he was conceding thirty-seven pounds. In an extraordinary race Rockingham went many lengths clear of his opponent and looked set to win easily. Robinson, believing that he had the race won, eased the horse down sixty yards from the finish, only to be overtaken and beaten on the line, provoking \\"roars of laughter\\" from the crowd. Rockingham's brief season ended with two wins in Sussex in August. He won his second Gold Cup at Brighton and then won the King's Plate at Lewes when his only opponent, Lord Exeter's mare Datura, was disqualified for running \\"on the wrong side of the post\\". =1836: six-year-old season= Rockingham began his final season in June with a second attempt at the Ascot Gold Cup, and repeated his previous effort by finishing second, this time to the five-year-old Touchstone. Although a minority believed that he had been the victim of another poor ride, most observers concluded that his best days had passed. In the following month he finished unplaced in both the Goodwood Stakes and the Goodwood Cup, carrying top weight on both occasions. Rockingham's only victory of the season came on 5 August, when he defeated Lord Exeter's four-year-old Luck's-all to take the Brighton Gold Cup for the third year in succession. His racing came to an end a week later when he finished unplaced under a weight of 137 pounds in the Lewes Stakes. Stud career Rockingham was expected to be a successful breeding stallion and began his stud career in 1837 at Stockwell in Surrey, at a fee of 20 guineas. He appeared in the list of stallions for only four seasons and sired few winners of any consequence. Rockingham was sold in November 1841 to the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and was exported by steamboat to Hamburg. He stood in Germany for the 1842 and 1843 seasons, but does not appear in subsequent Mecklenburg-Schwerin stud registers. Rockingham died young, probably after 1843. Pedigree * Rockingham was inbred 3 × 4 to Trumpator, meaning that this stallions appears twice in both the third and the fourth generations of his pedigree. He was also inbred 4 × 4 to Sir Peter Teazle and Promise.

The charity was founded in 2007 by British entrepreneur Tom Cairnes along with Dr Matthew Clark, a UK pediatrician who visited Sierra Leone as a medical student. They now serve on the charity's Board of Directors. The name Welbodi is derived from the Krio word for “health”. Welbodi is based at the Ola During Children's Hospital (ODCH) in Freetown, which is Sierra Leone's only paediatric referral and teaching hospital. Welbodi's goals and accomplishments Child health statistics for Sierra Leone are among the worst in the world where nearly 1 in 5 children die before the age of five, mostly from preventable diseases like pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria. The charity's aim is to reduce child mortality in Sierra Leone by improving the quality of pediatric care. Welbodi seeks to contribute towards the achievement of one of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals: to reduce child mortality by two-thirds by 2015. Welbodi supports the training of medical and non-medical personnel at the hospital, collaborating with ODCH and the Government of Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation to strengthen undergraduate and postgraduate training in paediatrics for both doctors and nurses. They also provide equipment and supplies to support the provision of healthcare and to ensure that training programmes can be delivered effectively. In 2011, Welbodi was able to provide the hospital with a standby generator which provides power to life-saving medical equipment during Freetown's frequent electrical power cuts. Welbodi is currently fundraising to provide the hospital with an x-ray machine and radiology department. Children who need an x-ray currently have to travel across Freetown, a journey which is not always possible if the child is seriously unwell. Welbodi is also committed to helping the hospital gain accreditation from the West African College of Physicians to become a training facility for specialist paediatricians. This would be the first training programme of its kind in Sierra Leone. Welbodi has worked in partnership with ODCH, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and local community leaders to establish the Sierra Leone Institute for Child Health (SLICH).

Subsequently, it belonged to various Baltic German families from the local upper-class. In 1740, it became the property of the Anrep family and stayed in their hands for much of its later history. It thus was the property of explorer Reinhold von Anrep-Elmpt, his father Russian general Joseph Carl von Anrep, and his father, Reinhold von Arnep, also a general. A monument commemorating the latter, who died in the Battle of Mohrungen during the War of the Fourth Coalition, is located near the manor house. The manor house was built in the mid-18th century and rebuilt in the early 20th century, but was destroyed in a fire soon after. The building received its present appearance during the subsequent rebuilding, led by Riga-based architect Otto Wildau. A park was laid out for the house in 1904, designed by Walter von Engelhardt, also from Riga.

EDO is a toolkit based on EDGE Whole Earth, a software program developed by a company named Autometric, now part of Boeing. While EDGE was initially mainly developed for SGI machines, EDO is mainly Windows-based. EDO retained much of EDGE's functionality but allowed greater flexibility for developers, i.e. the ability to integrate EDO functionality into their own application leveraging on EDO's libraries. Google Earth is the more famous heir to the 3D applications EDGE and EDO. However, unlike Google Earth, EDO and EDGE were not just 3D or 2D visualisation applications, but they allowed for analysis, e.g. line of sight analysis, and therefore were also used for military applications. EDO provides a continuous display of surveillance and reconnaissance sensors’ positions and fields-of-view, including terrain constraints. The open interface can also deliver real-time data surveillance and reconnaissance feeds using data displayed in a 3-D visualization environment. With precision sensor analysis, satellites and air and ground-based platforms, essential intelligence can be collected in real time. For these reasons, a licensed copy of EDO was also installed in the White House. In addition, outside the United States, the Australian Defence Force uses a licensed copy of this software (FORCE LEVEL EW IN THE AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE by Anthony Finn, Greg Chalmers, and Adrian Pincombe). In 2005, EDO was renamed BDO (BattleScape Developer option), and a full-fledged application, named BattleScape, was released together with the toolkit. Mark Turner was the first lead engineer for BDO, followed by Brian Griglak and since 2010 by Valentino Zocca.

Since 2013, as Research Fellow with Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) and IUCN SSC/WCPA Marine Mammal Protected Areas Task Force co-chair with Giuseppe Notarbartolo di Sciara, Hoyt has focussed on the creation and development of the new conservation tool of Important Marine Mammal Areas, or IMMAs. In 2016, following a MAVA Foundation pilot project to identify IMMAs in the Mediterranean, the Task Force's GOBI collaboration funded by the German Climate Initiative (IKI) began a six-year project to identify and implement IMMAs across most of the southern hemisphere. The IMMA tool has been received and widely endorsed by the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), various commissions within the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the International Whaling Commission, as well as national governments and scientists.http://www.marinemammalhabitat.org Writing Hoyt wrote the first book on whale watching, The Whale Watcher’s Handbook (Doubleday, Penguin, 1984), which zoologist—BBC-TV presenter Mark Carwardine named his number one wildlife-book classic.Carwardine, M. 1995. Natural Classic, BBC Wildlife, July, p79. \\"When Hoyt wrote this book, he was well ahead of his time…few people had grasped the concept of whale-watching as a major, worldwide growth industry…It has been very influential over the years.\\" Hoyt also wrote the resolution that put whale watching on the International Whaling Commission agenda in the 1990s. That book, as well as his first book about his seven summers in the 1970s and 1980s with killer whales, or orcas, are considered classic whale texts.Publishers Weekly, June 26, 1981, review, p5410] Discover, September 1981, p77-78.

He qualified as a doctor in 1951, gained experience as a registrar in Hammersmith Hospital and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London. In the late 1950s he returned to South Africa to Johannesburg Hospital where he became Professor of Cardiology in the research unit and carried out significant studies on cardiac disorders as well as discovering the cause of a well known mitral valve disorder. He gives his name to Barlow's Syndrome. Professional life John Barlow commenced medical studies at the University of the Witwatersrand. However, shortly afterwards, in 1940 when South Africa became involved in World War II he enlisted in the military and spent time attached to British forces in North Africa and later the Fifth US Army in Italy. He returned to medical school in 1946 and graduated with MBBCh. in November 1951. Barlow served his internship and registrar posts in the Royal Imperial Hospital, Baragwanath Hospital and in 1955 set sail for England to sit his examination for membership of the Royal College of Physicians. He worked as SHO to Sheila Sherlock and medical registrar under Mr John McMichael at Hammersmith Hospital and The Royal Post Graduate Medical School in London. It was during this time that Barlow became interested in auscultation and phonocardiography which led him to investigate non-ejection clicks and late systolic murmurs. The non-ejection click had long been thought to have an origin outside the heart. During his time at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School Barlow attended the postmortem examination of a patient who was known to have a 'click'. Barlow noticed that the man had a single fibrosed mitral valve chord, he also noted no abnormality outside the heart to account for the click. Barlow, by further investigation, was able to demonstrate that the cause of this widely known but little understood problem was due to a pathological condition of the mitral valve. This discovery by Barlow was controversial at the time and was met with scepticism by the cardiological community. His first paper on the subject was declined on the grounds that his assertions were extreme. A friend and former colleague persuaded Barlow to submit a shorter version of the paper to the Maryland State Medical Journal (of which his friend was a sub-editor) where it was published under the title \\"The Significance of Late Systolic Murmurs and Mid- Late Systolic Clicks\\". A second and ground-breaking paper was published in the American Heart Journal in October 1963. So significant was this paper that it became one of the most commonly cited papers in the AHJ and in 1983 was designated by the Institute for Scientific Information as a citation classic. In addition to his specialised work on the mitral valve he furthered research and published papers in other cardiac pathologies including the role of tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve surgery; the role of a haemodynamic valve load as the origin of refractory heart failure in patients with active carditis; submitral aneurysm; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the time course of \\"false positive stress ECGs\\" In the late 1950s Barlow had returned to South Africa to work at Johannesburg Hospital as a registrar. In 1960 he became a consultant physician in the cardiac research unit, in 1971 he was appointed director of the cardiology unit and named his newly commissioned cardiac catheterization unit the McMichael Unit in honour of his erstwhile mentor. In 1972, together with Margaret McClaren and others, he carried out a study on 12,000 schoolchildren of Soweto which demonstrated very high levels of rheumatic heart disease. When the paper was published in the British Medical Journal the international publicity highlighted the poor socio-economic conditions of the children living under the laws of apartheid, the South African government was critical of the study. In 1980 he was awarded a Professorship of Cardiology,(Ad Hominem) and continued in this post for a further 10 years to his retirement. Barlow was widely acknowledged by his peers as an excellent clinician who put great store in taking a careful medical history and a thorough physical examination. He tended not to trust medical tests and questioned medical orthodoxy in general. He treated people from all walks of life, from poor children from Soweto to President Nelson Mandela. Later in his career he found maintaining standards more difficult as other consultants either emigrated or moved to the private medicine sector, but even after his retirement he continued to support, advise, consult and supervise until a few months before his death. Barlow had a deserved international reputation for his knowledge of cardiac problems, specifically those associated with murmurs of the mitral valve. He described the development and mechanism of the 'click' and murmur and showed that they were caused by prolapse or billowing of the valve and mitral regurgitation respectively. He also described other pathological conditions of the mitral valve including associated regurgitation, abnormal changes of rhythms and associated abnormal electrocardiograph readings. In 1968 Barlow and Wendy Pocock co-authored a paper published by the British Heart Journal Bibliography Perspectives on the Mitral Valve F.A. Davis Company, Philadelphia, 1986. . The dedication reads — > \\"To all the students who listen, look, touch and reflect: may they hear, > see, feel and comprehend\\" Personal life John Barlow was the son of Lancelot White Barlow, a South African who studied medicine in England and returned to South Africa to work as a medical pathologist. His mother was Madeline Dicks who Lancelot met while studying medicine. Educated at St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa), where he excelled as a sportsman - especially rugby. He had a reputation for flouting the rules. As a medical student he was fond of referring to rare or bizarre medical conditions, this earned him the nickname 'Canary' alluding to the fact that canaries are rare in South Africa, Later Barlow, in a tribute to this name (and his eccentricity) kept canaries outside his office. Barlow married Shelagh Cox in 1949 and they had two sons, Richard John and Clifford William who are medical consultants in dermatology and cardio-thoracic surgery respectively and working in the United Kingdom. Awards Among many local and international awards made to John Barlow are the following: * Walter Bleifield Award for Distinguished Contribution in the Field of Clinical Research in Clinical Cardiology from the International Society of Heart Failure. * Louis and Artur Lucian Award for Outstanding Research in the Field of Diseases of the Circulation from McGill University in Montreal. * First Recipient of Award for Distinguished Contributions to National and International Cardiology from the South African Cardiac Society in Johannesburg. * Percy Fox Foundation National Award for Outstanding Work as an Internationally Recognized Authority in Cardiology. * Annual Laennec Society Lectureship from the American Heart Association. * Annual St Cyres Lectureship, National Heart Hospital in London and British Cardiac Society. * André Allard Medal for Distinguished Service to Medicine from the International Academy of Aviation and Space Medicine. * The Seymour Lectureship and Medal for Distinguished Service to International Medicine from Wesley Medical Center, Wichita, Kansas. * President's Medal for Distinguished Contributions to International Cardiology from the National Council of the South Africa Cardiac Society. * Honorary Research Fellowship from the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.

Except for its source and mouth, the river flows in Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship. Its length is 138 kilometers, and the area of the basin 2007,9 km2. Geographers argue whether the source of the Kamienna is located in a swampy area near the village of Antoniow (Szydłowiec County, 361 meters above sea level), or near the village of Borki (also Szydłowiec County). This results in differences with the length of the river. Most sources state that it is 138 kilometers long, but in some accounts, the length varies from 127 up to 156 kilometers. The mouth of the river lies near the village of Kepa Piotrowinska (Lipsko County). Unlike other rivers of southern Poland (San or Nida), Kamienna does not owe its name to the Celts. According to Zygmunt Gloger, the river was first mentioned in 1228. Jan Długosz called it Kamionna, while on an 1815 map it is named Kaimienka. The name is of Slavic origin (the word kamien means stone); in the past it was spelled Camoni (1379), Camyonna (1437), Camyen (1399), Kamienie (1399), and Kamienne (1393). For its initial several kilometers, the Kamienna flows parallel to the Swietokrzyskie Mountains. It also has some character of a mountain river, as the source is located at the height of app. 360 meters above sea level, while the mouth is at 130 meters. After flowing through Wąchock, the Kamienna leaves hilly areas, to enter a wide valley, which narrows before Starachowice. The Kamienna valley in the sector from Soltykow to Cmielow (74 kilometers) makes a convenient transport corridor, in which a rail line from Koluszki to Ostrowiec was built in 1885. Near Cmielow the river changes its course, turning northwards. Finally, it discharges into the Vistula, but before that, it flows for some two kilometers in the ancient stream valley of the Vistula. Kamienna flows through the towns of Skarżysko-Kamienna, Wąchock, Starachowice, and Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski. There are four reservoirs on the river: Zalew Blizynski, Zalew Wąchock, Zalew Starachowice – Pasternik, and Zalew Brodzki or Jezioro Brodzkie. The valley of the Kamienna is closely associated with early years of Polish industry. Here, Old-Polish Industrial Region lies, there also is a blue-color tourist trail called Along Traces of Technological Monuments of the Kamienna River, which goes from Skarżysko-Kamienna to Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski. First industrial facilities appeared along the Kamienna in the 15th century. In a 1547 document, a mine in Starachowice is mentioned, which excavated iron ore. Local ironworks developed in the late 16th century, and during the reign of King John III Sobieski, a blast furnace was built in Bartow on the Kamienna. Later on, other furnaces were added, at Ruda Baltowska, Cmielow, Antoniow, Aleksandrów, Stefankow. Due to efforts of Stanislaw Staszic, the region prospered in the first half of the 19th century. Staszic designed a number of metallurgical facilities, located along the Kamienna. They all were planned to create one large enterprise, called Ironworks of the Kamienna River. According to the estimates of Stanislaw Staszic, out of 172 iron ore mines in the Old Industrial Region, 54 were located along the river. All these plans collapsed after the November Uprising.

Wright was born in Ohio and raised in Chicago. In 1914, he became chairman of Chicago's Calumet Baking Powder company. He took the reins from his father, William Monroe Wright (1851 - 1931) the founder of the company . He guided it so prosperously that Calumet Baking Powder was sold for $32 million in the summer of 1929 to a New York company, Postum. Postum, with numerous acquisitions, soon became General Foods. The purchase and subsequent Wall Street Crash of 1929, just months later, left the Wrights among the wealthiest people in America during the Great Depression.http://us.macmillan.com/wildride/AnneAuerbach Warren Wright Sr. would also make his name and that of the family business the \\"gold standard\\" for Thoroughbred racing and breeding. William Monroe Wright had moved a Standardbred horse farm from Illinois to Kentucky in 1924. Upon the elders death in 1931, Warren converted the Lexington farm, which bore the company name, from Standardbreds to Thoroughbreds. During Wright's 20-year reign, Calumet Farm would become a dominant American stable and a tourist destination in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. Calumet Farm was often compared to the New York Yankees (baseball), Boston Celtics (basketball) and Montreal Canadiens (hockey), as a sports dynasty. With Ben A. Jones as his trainer, Bull Lea as his main stallion, and a bevy of choice broodmares, Wright bred and raced winners of five American Horse of the Year titles in the 1940s alone. They were: Whirlaway (1941 & 1942), Twilight Tear (1944), Armed (1947), and Citation (1948). Additionally, Calumet's Whirlaway (1941) and Citation (1948) won the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and were national fan favorites. Wright won four Kentucky Derbys in his lifetime. After his death, his widow Lucille Parker Wright - who had married Admiral Gene Markey - carried on the tradition and won another four as Calumet Farm set the record of eight official Derby winners. Its racing silks were known throughout the land as the famous \\"devil's red and blue\\".http://us.macmillan.com/wildride/AnneAuerbach In 1934, Mr. Wright had given National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame inductee Eddie Arcaro his start by putting him under contract and letting him ride at Narragansett Park during its inaugural year. Arcaro would ride three of Calumet's Derby winners and both Triple Crown winners.\\"I Ride to Win\\" by Eddie Arcaro(1951) In late summer of 1949, Mr. Wright suffered a heart attack.

He joined the paper in 1817, as a music critic, and later moved to the financial side. Alsager gradually bought himself into the paper, becoming a partner, and joint manager with William Delane. He was close to the banker Nathan Rothschild. Much later, after 1845, Alsager left, after a scandal involving puffery. The position he had created for a professional music critic, an innovation by The Times, was taken over by James William Davison. Death Alsager lost his wife in 1845 (they had 13 children). This was the period of the Railway Mania, and The Times had taken a position against rampant speculation; but Alsager and Delane were also said to have promoted the direct London and Exeter line, in which they had shares. Alsager's departure from the paper was at least nominally over an accounting matter. Year later and \\"since the death of his wife [...] he had been a saddened man[...] on November 6he was found in bed with his throat cut. He was seriuously injured, but a surgeon succeeded in reviving him; a relapse however, followed, and on November15 he died\\".History of The Times 1841–1884: The Tradition Established Printing House Square 1939. p 22 Literary connections A copy of George Chapman's Homer belonging to Alsager has entered literary history. It was lent to Charles Cowden Clarke, who read it with John Keats, leading to the sonnet On First Looking into Chapman's Homer.Holden, p. 103. On the committee of the Surrey Institution, Alsager persuaded William Hazlitt to give his 1818 Lectures on the English Poets there. Antiquary and clothworker He became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1837. Son of a clothworker, Alsager was elected Master of The Clothworkers' Company (1836-7) and transformed the affairs of the organisation. He discovered that the Company’s financial affairs had been allowed to fall into a perilous state. Too much responsibility had been allowed to devolve upon the Clerk unchecked and as a result thorough reform was required. Alsager overhauled the Company’s administration; implementing new accounting procedures and introducing a system of standing committees with clear reporting structures for the first time. In so doing, he transformed the Company into a modern looking financial corporation, enabling it to enter a Victorian golden age in which it became more heavily involved in charitable work. For this reason he is considered the Company’s most important Master. Musical amateur Alsager was one of the \\"Cockney Mozartians\\", with Edward Holmes, Cowden Clarke, Thomas Attwood, Henry Robertson and Vincent Novello. Another of the circle who was a personal friend was William Ayrton. The meetings of the \\"Queen Square Select Society\\" were at his house. He founded the Beethoven Quartet Society in 1845, which was partly instigated by the \\"Queen Square Select Society\\". The first complete British performance of the Missa solemnis took place at Alsager's home, on Christmas Eve in 1832.

Since its inception as a nationally syndicated show in 2002, the program has become one of the highest rated radio programs. Furthermore, it led to television shows on CNN and the Fox News Channel, six New York Times bestselling books (five of which debuted at No. 1), a magazine, and a stage tour. In 2009, many editorials, such as those on The Huffington Post, singled out Glenn Beck's radio and television programs for raising issues which led to the resignation of Obama advisor Van Jones.Huffington Post, September 6, 2009, Glenn Beck Gets First Scalp: Van Jones ResignsArianna Huffington, HuffPost, September 7, 2009, \\"Thank You, Glenn Beck!\\" History In 2000, The Glenn Beck Program began airing on WFLA (AM) 970 in Tampa, Florida. He inherited the 18th-placed position at WFLA and quickly gained popularity in its afternoon slot. Within one year of doing his first talk show in afternoon drive at WFLA, Beck dominated the ratings, giving the station its first No. 1 program ever. Due to the overwhelming demand for live, news oriented programming after September 11, 2001, Beck was offered a jump start on national syndication, and Premiere Radio Networks launched Beck into syndication on January 2, 2002, having already added other affiliates such as KPRC in Houston and WGST in Atlanta. On January 14, 2002, WPHT in Philadelphia became the flagship station. Beck ran a series of rallies called \\"Glenn Beck's Rally for America\\" during 2003, in support of the troops fighting the Iraq War. While generally attended by war supporters, Beck spoke of many who \\"disagreed with the war, but still supported the troops\\". He ran the final rally at Marshall University, over the Memorial Day weekend. The event drew about 25,000 people. 2005 marked a year of substantial ratings growth. The program ended the year being heard on more than 200 stations, and was the third highest-rated national radio talk show among adults ages 25 to 54, according to Premiere Research/Arbitron. On January 17, 2006, Beck began a new television show at CNN Headline News. To accommodate the new show, Beck relocated his studios to Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Until January 2011, Beck's flagship station in New York City was WOR. The show added its 300th affiliate in 2008. Its 400th affiliate, KRLA in Los Angeles, was added in June 2010. On October 16, 2008, Beck announced that he had signed a \\"multi- year deal\\" that would put him in the popular 5 p.m. (Eastern) time slot on the Fox News Channel. He decided not to renew his contract with CNN, instead taking a deal from Fox because he felt Fox would give him permission to voice his opinions. After his dismissal from Fox News, Bill O'Reilly joined the show as a contributor, appearing every Friday or whenever certain news warrants. Format Combining elements of the comedy-centric hot talk format and more traditional talk-radio shows, like Rush Limbaugh, and Sean Hannity, the Program consists of humor, political commentary, discussions about current events popular culture and personal reflections from the host. The first half of each hour of the show is usually a monologue by Beck, but occasionally will include a guest or some conversation with the production staff. During the second half of each hour, Beck takes callers and continues discussing the themes he has previously introduced. Promotions for companies like \\"My Patriot Supply\\" and \\"ZipRecruiter\\" are common during certain moments of the show even if there are no commercial breaks. The show also features two contributing co- hosts, Steve \\"Stu\\" Burguiere and Pat Gray, and the Producer, Jeff \\"Jeffy\\" Fisher, also contributes to the content. In January 2010, Beck changed his show's theme music to a rock anthem with sampled voices overlaid. The music was performed by Anthony Newett, the vocals by Stephen Lyons and the lyrics written by Beck and Burguiere. Lyrics included the refrain, \\"We must remember who we are, we will be the key.\\"http://dummiesoftheyear.com/glenn-beck-new- theme-song-2010/ In January 2011, the show's theme music changed again to a song that was similar to the 2010 version.http://dummiesoftheyear.com/glenn- beck-new-theme-song-2011/http://www.therightscoop.com/glenn-becks-first- segment-of-2011 In January 2013, the theme music became a heavier rock background, and the lyrics changed to: \\"Turn it up! Turn it on, let's go! Turn it up! It's Glenn Beck on the radio!\\" In 2016, the theme song became \\"We Are One\\", sung by David Osmond (son of Alan Osmond) and American Idol contestant Jenn Blosil. In September 2017, \\"We Are One\\" was retired in favor of a new theme song – a simple acoustic guitar tune and a female voice saying \\"Love. Courage. Truth. This is The Glenn Beck Program\\". Reception Beck's on-air persona has been described as a \\"mix of moral lessons, outrage and an apocalyptic view of the future … capturing the feelings of an alienated class of Americans.\\" Beck has referred to himself as an entertainer, and a rodeo clown. Additionally, Beck has identified himself with Howard Beale, the fictional news anchor portrayed by Peter Finch in the 1976 film Network, who, in a moment of indignation and fury, urges his viewers to declare \\"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\\" Says Beck, \\"When [Beale] came out of the rain and he was like, none of this makes any sense. I am that guy.\\" Beck's style of expressing his candid opinions have helped make his shows successful, but have also resulted in protest. On November 14, 2006, Beck asked then-newly elected Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, to \\"prove to me that you are not working with our enemies\\" and saying \\"And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way.\\" Beck later regretted the question, saying it was \\"quite possibly the poorest-worded question of all time\\" and joked about his \\"lack of intelligence\\". While Ellison stated he was not offended by the question, it later spurred several Arab-American organizations, such as the Arab Institute and the Muslim Public Affairs Council,2003 – 2007 Report on Hate Crimes and Discrimination Against Arab Americans , American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Research Institute. to publicly protest Beck's hiring as a commentator by Good Morning America, accusing Beck of \\"anti-Muslim and anti-Arab prejudice\\". Ratings According to Talkers Magazine, Beck's program was the third most- listened-to radio program in the United States in 2009.TALKERS magazine – The 2009 Heavy Hundred In comparison, his television show on Fox News Channel peaked in ratings in 2009 at 3.4 million views, but had dropped to a third in 2010, before he left to create his own network.

During the first practice of the season, at Virginia, he was the fastest of 20 drivers. The season started smoothly for Köykkä with wins at Virginia and Lime Rock. Race 5 at New Jersey Motorsports Park was a low point. Matias shut off the engine while leading the race, but managed to recover to sixth position. Due to this mistake his nearest competitor Bryan Herta Autosport driver Brandon Newey was hot on his tail. After this Matias scored 6 podium finishes, including 2 wins, in the 7 remaining races. This secured Matias Köykkä of the championship placing Brandon Newey second place and Jeremy Grenier in third.

It was built between 1871 and 1874 as part of the city's waterworks system designed to provide potable water to the city, including Ellis Island. Its perimeter wall is in the Egyptian Revival style and pump stations are in the Romanesque Revival style. The reservoir provided drinking water until the 1980s, when it was drained and abandoned for a larger reservoir at the Boonton Gorge. Since that time, a mini-ecosystem has taken root behind the thick, 20-foot tall stone walls: trees, wildflowers, swans, great blue heron, peregrine falcons, and at the center a 6-acre (2.4 ha) lake. This urban wildlife preserve hosts numerous animal and plant species not otherwise found in an urban environment. It was listed on the state and the federal registers of historic places in 2012. Nearby Reservoir No. 1 was located on either side of Summit Avenue and has been demolished. The Jersey City Reservoir Preservation Alliance, started in 2002, runs the maintenance and supervision programs necessary to keep the park open to the public every Saturday from May–October. The Alliance also runs summertime programming in arts, music, and recreation to bring new and returning community members to the space. The Alliance received the Ted Conrad “Preservationist of the Year” Award in 2005.

The Welsh were victorious, and the battle ended the traditional hegemony of Mercia over north Wales and contributed to Æthelred's decision to accept the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex. This united the Anglo-Saxons who were not living under Viking rule under Alfred, and was a step towards the creation of the Kingdom of England. Anarawd allied himself with the Vikings shortly after the battle, but he then abandoned this alliance to follow Æthelred in accepting Alfred's lordship. Background The Welsh kingdoms had been subject to Mercia since the mid seventh-century, and in 853 the Mercians received the assistance of the West Saxons to maintain their hegemony.Charles-Edwards, pp. 413, 486 In the 870s Mercia became subject to attacks by the Viking Great Heathen Army, and in 874 it drove out King Burgred. He was succeeded by the last independent King of Mercia, Ceolwulf II, who was presented by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as a puppet of the Vikings. In 877 they partitioned Mercia, taking the east for themselves and leaving the west to Ceolwulf.Williams, \\"Ceolwulf II\\" Gwynedd was also under attack from the Vikings, and in 877 King Rhodri Mawr was defeated and driven out. He returned the following year, but immediately came under attack from Mercia, which was still trying to maintain its hegemony in Wales. King Alfred's victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in May 878 relieved the pressure on Mercia, and in the same year Mercia defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr. Ceolwulf died or was deposed in 879, and was succeeded as Lord of the Mercians by Æthelred.Charles-Edwards, pp. 486–490 The battle In 881 the Mercians invaded Gwynedd, and they met Anarawd and his brothers, sons of Rhodri, at the Battle of the Conwy. The result was a Mercian defeat, described by Welsh annals as \\"revenge by God for Rhodri\\". In the view of Thomas Charles-Edwards, this represents the Welsh view of the conflict between the two kingdoms as a blood feud. According to a thirteenth-century collection of Welsh genealogies, the Mercian leader was called \\"Edryd Long-Hair\\", almost certainly Æthelred. This is supported by The History of Wales, published in 1697, described by Simon Keynes as \\"of quite uncertain authority\\": :The Britons having returned their thanks to Anarawd, presently fell to work, and Necessity giving edge to their Valour, they easily dispossessed the Saxons who were not as yet warm in their Seats. For some time they continued peaceably in this part of Wales; but Eadred Duke of Mercia, called by the Welch Edryd Wallthir, not being able to bear any longer such an ignominious ejection, made great Preparations for the re-gaining of the said Country. But the Northern Britons, who had settled themselves there, having intelligence of his Design, for the better security of their Cattel and other Effects, moved them beyond the River Conwey. Prince Anarawd in the meantime was not idle, but drawing together all the Strength he could raise, encamped his army near the Town of Conwey at a place called Cymryt, where he and his Men having made gallant Resistance against the pressing Efforts of the Saxons, obtained a very compleat Victory. This Battel was by some called Gwaeth Cymryt Conwey, by reason that it was fought in the Township of Cymryt near Conwey. But Prince Anarawd would have it called Dial Rodri, because he had there revenged the Death of his Father Rodri.Keynes, p. 19 and n. 84; Carrodoc, p. 38 Aftermath After the Battle of the Conwy, Mercia was forced to abandon its claim to lordship over north Wales, although Æthelred continued to attempt to exercise power over the south-eastern Welsh kingdoms of Glywysing and Gwent. These kingdoms sought the lordship of Alfred the Great, according to his biographer, Asser, \\"driven by the military power and tryanny of Ealdorman Æthelred and the Mercians\\". Æthelred followed in accepting West Saxon lordship by 883. In the view of Thomas Charles Edwards: :The implication of all this is that the Mercian submission to Alfred – a crucial step in the creation of a single English kingdom – occurred not just because of one battle, Alfred's victory over the Great Army at Edington in 878, but also because of another, more distant battle, 'God's revenge' on the Mercians at the Conwy, when Anarawd of Gwynedd and his brothers defeated Æthelred and so brought about that collapse of the Mercian hegemony in Wales from which Alfred was only too pleased to benefit.Charles-Edwards, p. 493 Gwynedd formed an alliance with the Vikings of Northumbria soon after the battle, and according to Asser the south-west Welsh kingdom of Dyfed and the central southern kingdom of Brycheiniog sought Alfred's lordship due to the tyranny of Gwynedd. Asser also stated that Anarawd abandoned his Viking alliance because it brought him no benefit and submitted to Alfred. In Charles-Edwards' view, this may have been because Viking raids on Gwynedd continued. Welsh annals record an attack by the 'Dark Northmen' on Gwynedd in 892.Charles-Edwards, pp. 491–494 NotesReferencesSources   Battles involving Wales Battles involving Mercia 880s conflicts 881 ","title":"Battle of the Conwy"},{"id":"38660200","text":"Chahgah (, also Romanized as Chāhgāh) is a village in Sardasht Rural District, in the Central District of Lordegan County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran.

Written by Russel Friend and Garrett Lerner and directed by Eric Stoltz, it aired on Fox in the United States on March 21, 2013. Kelley Mitchell, Jennifer Greenberg, Melissa Buell, Tym Shutchai Buacharern, Paula Jane Hamilton and Darla Albright were nominated at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Makeup for a Single-Camera Series for this episode. Plot Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) take over the glee club while Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is out sick, and have New Directions perform their musical guilty pleasures in order to strengthen the bond between its members. Blaine and Sam perform \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\\" as a demonstration, and Sam later performs \\"Copacabana\\", followed by Blaine, who performs \\"Against All Odds\\". Sam notices that Blaine directs the song at him, and Blaine admits he had a crush on him. Sam reveals that he's known for a while and respects Blaine's feelings as they reaffirm their friendship. Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist), Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) perform \\"Wannabe\\", and Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) notes how Kitty became closer to New Directions. The girls later confront Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist) over performing a Chris Brown song, and although he claims that they should differentiate an artist's personal life from their work, he agrees to change the song and performs \\"My Prerogative\\". In New York, Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) returns to the loft, and Brody Weston (Dean Geyer) moves out after his fight with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). Santana reveals to Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) that Brody was a gigolo, and Rachel later confronts Brody at NYADA, where they decide that their relationship has definitely come to an end. Santana and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) later comfort Rachel, and they sing \\"Mamma Mia\\" together, simultaneously with New Directions, who perform it to celebrate the success of the assignment.

Reception=Ratings= The episode was watched by 5.91 million American viewers and garnering a 2.0/6 rating/share among adults 18-49. The show placed second in its timeslot, behind Grey's Anatomy. This episode tied in 18-49 ratings from the previous episode \\"Feud,\\" but this episode saw an increase in viewers. Via DVR, the episode was watched by 2.42 million viewers with a 1.5 rating, bringing the total to 8.33 million viewers and a 3.1 rating. =Critical reception= The episode received mainly positive reviews from critics. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter gave the episode a positive review, complimenting the Radiohead cover, calling it \\"solid,\\" and also saying the episode \\"set the stage for the final five episodes of the season.\\" Jennifer Broadwater of The Baltimore Sun also complimented the Radiohead cover, calling it \\"probably my favorite song of the show.\\" Tierney Bricker of E! Online called the breakup of Rachel and Brody one of Thursday's \\"Best TV Moments.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, saying it \\"was a solid episode to leave us with while the show goes off on a mini-hiatus. We got some Fondue for Two and a few solid performances and some drama that actually kind of made sense except for Rachel swooning over Finn punching Brody in the face.\\" She also called the theme of the week \\"a strong one and by keeping it in sight at all times, Glee remained on the straight and narrow of decent storytelling. That, and guilty pleasures are just inherently fun. Occasionally mortifying. But fun.\\" One of few negative reviews of the episode came from Daniel Sperling of Vulture, saying \\"We've had silly Glee before. For instance, the superhero episode earlier this season was goofy and tongue-in-cheek enough for us to get into. But for whatever reason, it's all too much this time.\\" He also gave a mixed review to the Chris Brown subplot, saying \\"The debate among the characters is a mature one with reasonable arguments being made all round. But on the other hand, it doesn't feel right for Glee to use a very delicate and troubling situation involving a real-life domestic violence case for shock value. Note how Jake's plan to cover Brown is discovered right before an ad break and jars severely with the rest of the light and fluffy episode.\\" He also called Rachel and Brody's breakup \\"the most substantial development of the episode, and we can't help but mourn the lack of other good story stuff.\\" Rae Votta of Billboard said \\"This episode tastes great, but did we learn anything we needed to learn to get to a satisfying thematic end for the season? Not really, at least in Lima. At least in New York Rachel finally feels ready to shake off the weirdness of being a fish out of water and clinging to both the old and the shiny new and in turn focus on her own singular triumphs. For the growing kids in Ohio this was an adult-less episode, and left to run amuck in Ohio even with the best of intentions, the group didn't do much pat each other on the back and eliminate 99 percent of any lingering drama.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" at Fox.com  2013 American television episodes Glee (season 4) episodes ","title":"Guilty Pleasures (Glee)"},{"id":"38660225","text":"Chilteh-ye Dudera (, also Romanized as Chīlteh-ye Dūderā’; also known as Chīlteh) is a village in Sardasht Rural District, in the Central District of Lordegan County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran.

He specialised in the study of birds in southern Iberia. Life Irby was born in 1836 at Boyland Hall in Morningthorpe to Rear-Admiral Frederick Paul Irby and Frances (born Wright). His elder sister Paulina Irby was to become a Balkan heroine. Irby joined the 90th Light Infantry in 1854 and he left with them to be part of the Siege of Sevastopol. Here he fought but also collected the skins of the local birds. He was a captain by 1857 and he and his company were sent to China but were shipwrecked near Sumatra. This was the year of the Indian Rebellion so Irby was redirected to Calcutta. He and his company marched 700 miles to assist in the aftermath of the massacres that had occurred at Cawnpore. He was present at both the relief, siege and fall of Lucknow serving with Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet. He was known as a very good shot and for his ability to find birds to shoot and eat. More importantly his diary became devoted to his observations of birds. Irby moved regiments to the 74th Highlanders and was sent to Gibraltar in 1868 where his enthusiasm for ornithology matured under the guidance of Lord Lilford. White Shouldered Eagle - one of the colour plates by Archibald Thorburn supplied by Lord Lilford for Irby's 2nd edition It was Lilford's insistence that saw Irby create the important book titled the \\"Ornithology of the Straits of Gibraltar\\". The book was influenced by Irby's annoyance at seeing other people publish work that did not correctly attribute the original findings. Irby was obsessive about only reporting findings he had seen with his own eyes and this did lead to him not recording some species that were known to be there. In the second edition he was persuaded to also include the findings of Cole Verner and his friend Lord Lilford supplied fine colour pictures of birds of prey. This book recorded many new observations of birds on both sides of the Straits in Europe and in Africa. Irby retired in 1874 after spending three years on half pay. His interest in birds continued holidaying with William Willoughby Cole Verner on Tiree. They had first met in 1877 and this was the start of a lifelong friendship. Irby died in the Regent's Park area of London in 1905. Family He married on 31 August 1864, Geraldine Alicia Mary Magenis (died 1882); they had two sons. Then on 22 January 1884, he married Mary Brandling; they had a daughter, Frances Margaret Irby.

Tyler Doupe praised the cast's performances; ″Sawa turned in a good performance, as Travis. And Mischa Barton successfully broke the mold of the roles we’ve seen her play time and again. The late Michael Clark Duncan was excellent as the high school principal.″ Doupe also praised the resourceful use of the low budget, noting that ″The film feels like a movie that was made for a lot more money than what was actually spent...It takes true creativity to stretch a micro budget into anything more than that, and Matt Orlando stretched his budget very effectively.″ Doupe also commented that ″A Resurrection did a good job of leaving certain aspects of the film up to the viewer to figure out. We are not spoon fed every detail and audiences appreciate that. We respect filmmakers that trust their viewers to put the pieces together themselves.″ He continued; ″the premise is primarily unique. I like the way that Matt Orlando's script mixed reality with aspects of occult spirituality and kept the viewer wondering how the two were ultimately going to work together.″Review: A Resurrection Shock Till You Drop. 17 March 2013 Legacy Issues surrounding the production of this film would ultimately make a major impact in an unexpected area—college basketball. Pittsburgh-based financial adviser Marty Blazer used money from some of his clients, which included professional athletes, to help finance the film. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that he had defrauded five clients out of $2.35 million in order to fund this film and other entertainment projects. Facing federal criminal charges stemming from this episode, he became an FBI informant in a major investigation of corruption in college basketball. The first wave of indictments stemming from this investigation were announced in fall 2017, and by March 2018 more than 35 NCAA Division I men's programs were potentially implicated in NCAA rules violations.

Design and development The F.K.47 was specifically built for H.L. Jonker Roelants as a sports tourer and registered in his name in June 1933. It had much in common with the early version of the Koolhoven F.K.46 sport and training aircraft, which first flew four months later. Both were two seat, single bay biplanes, with equal span, unswept wings of constant chord and strong stagger, braced with N-form struts. The upper wing of the F.K.47 was held above the fuselage primarily by a pair of short, outward leaning N-form cabane struts to the upper fuselage longerons. There was a shallow rounded cut-out in the trailing edge of this wing to enhance the upward view from the forward cockpit. The F.K.47 was powered by a 130 hp (97 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major air-cooled inverted inline engine, driving a two blade propeller. The fuselage had a rounded decking with the forward cockpit placed under the upper wing trailing edge and the aft one just behind the lower wing edge. Both cockpits were open. Aft, the fin was quadrant-shaped with a vertical rudder. The undercarriage was conventional, with the mainwheels on cantilever tube, faired legs, assisted by a tailwheel. Operational history At least some of Roelant's flights around Europe in the sole F.K.47, PH-EJR, ended badly. An early trip to the Dolomites in July 1933 ended prematurely with engine failure over Germany. Three years later, flying between Rotterdam and Paris but off course he landed at a military field where tensions had been raised by the recent German occupation of the Rhineland. He and his aircraft were briefly held under guard. He continued to use it until 1939 when it was destroyed.

In addition to monetary compensations and the lending of labour forces, this was considered a way of reparations. In mid-April 1949, Belgium surprisingly waived any interest in most of the previously claimed areas.  Actual assignments  Map of territorial changes On 1 April 1949 (prior to the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany), the border areas in the territories of North Rhine- Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate were temporarily divested to Belgium. These included the following areas: * The Aachen neighbourhood of Bildchen (a small hamlet west of Aachen). * Some parts of the village Leykaul and several farms in the Monschau district of Kalterherberg. * Losheim in Hellenthal municipality. * Losheimergraben. * Hemmeres, Winterspelt municipality in Rhineland-Palatinate. Originally, several German exclaves enclosed by Belgian territory were planned. These enclaves still exist, as the route of the Vennbahn railway is Belgian territory and thus divides the populated places west of it from the rest of the German territory. These places are: * Ruitzhof * Mützenich * The farm Rückschlag near Konzen. * The western part of the town Lammersdorf near Simmerath. * Parts of Roetgen Furthermore, there are several forested areas in the region between the Belgian town of Elsenborn and the German Kalterherberg. It was planned that the inhabitants of these areas should provisionally remain German citizens in spite of the shifted border. After the war, Belgium had gradually withdrawn its territorial claims. According to the Allied order of 26 March 1949, several populated places and the Vennbahn, which was of special interest for Belgium, should be handed over. Cited by However, on 15 April 1949, a sudden change of mind occurred in Belgium. The Belgian government officially declared that it waived the claims to most places and territories that been assigned to Belgium. This waiver was allegedly not the result of the ongoing protest by the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, but an insight into the inefficiency of the boundary corrections by Belgium. Because establishing the Vennbahn railway would require huge resources over the years, as had been assessed by Belgium, it was decided to refrain from adding adjacent villages to the military administration. Moreover, the Belgian government did not see any support from a majority of the Belgian population for these measures. The return of the annexed territories to Germany took place on 28 August 1958 due to a German- Belgian border treaty from 24 September 1956. The place Losheimergraben and the western part of the Leykaul municipality, as well as some forests, were excluded from this restoration. These areas remained in Belgium, and so did the previously Belgian municipalities of Eupen and Malmedy that had been incorporated into the German Reich in 1940. In January 2008, it was announced by Belgian Deputy District Commissioner Marcel Lejoly that the planned removal of the Vennbahn rails could have \\"international consequences\\", and it was speculated that the neighbouring areas had to be returned to Germany. But both the Belgian Foreign Ministry as well as the Foreign Office in Germany declared, that the boundaries were ultimately covered by contract and therefore no change would take place. The German-Belgian border treaty of 1956 cited by the Foreign Office does, however, not contain any indications as to what should happen if the railway facilities mentioned in the contract cease to exist. Therefore, the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles that are not superseded still govern the current borders. Moreover, the option of restoring the railway traffic has not been abandoned and also a bicycle route that has been planned on the former Vennbahn track would not change the borderline.

TechCrunch, 2010-01-12 The key components of the LPD technology are its TD2 tiles, its image processor and its backing frame that supports LPD tile arrays. The company unveiled the LPD in January 2010. Operation principles The concept behind the LPD technology is quite simple. LPD uses a set of movable mirrors to direct several beams of light from several ultra-violet lasers onto a screen made of a plastic-glass hybrid material coated with color phosphor stripes. The laser draws an image onto the screen by scanning line by line from top to bottom.Roush, Wade. \\"Prysm Hopes Laser-Driven Screens Will Outshine LCD, LED Displays\\".

Video walls are implemented using this new generation LPD TD2 tile, a virtually seamless, bezel-free building block. TD2, launched at InfoComm 2013, features increased resolution, brightness and enhanced uniformity. A variable number of TD2 tiles can be arranged in arbitrary configurations to form videowalls in various sizes and shapes.TD1 Tile Product Specification Sheet. PrysmPrysm to exhibit Cascade collaboration solutions and 4K UHD capabilities at InfoComm. AV Magazine, 2014-04-06 Advantages The main difference between the LPD and CRT technologies is that the first excites the phosphor (that emits light to produce the images) with a scanning laser beam deflected by a moving mirror, whereas the second uses an electron beam deflected by a magnetic or electrostatic field.\\"Definition of: Laser Phosphor Display\\". PCMag.com Whereas an electron beam must be projected through a vacuum--because in a gas, liquid, or solid medium the electrons would collide with atoms of the medium and combine with them to form ions--a laser beam can pass through air, so unlike a CRT, an LPD does not require a heavy airtight vacuum envelope (typically of glass) around the space between the beam source and the phosphor screen. Also, the collisions of the laser photons with the phosphor screen do not produce x-rays as a side effect, whereas electrons colliding with a screen in a vacuum do produce x-rays, requiring radiation shielding in a CRT (said shielding taking the form of leaded glass in most CRTs produced since the early 1980s) but not in a LPD. The absence of x-ray risk in LPD devices also eliminates the need for the safety circuits required in CRT monitors to shut down the display if it malfunctions so as to emit increased and unsafe levels of x-rays (which can happen if the high voltage applied to the tube increases beyond the design limit of the display). Another competitor, plasma display technology, consists of small cells of ionized gases that emit light–a process that requires a relatively large amount of power. And a conventional laser television, such as the LaserVue, made by Mitsubishi, uses red, blue, and green lasers and a micromirror device that combines and directs the light. This is essentially a rear-projection display that wasn't popular due to cost.Clancy, Heather. \\"Roger Hajjar's Prysm Wants to Bring Eco-Friendly, Life-Size Video To Your Home\\".

CIO, 2012-11-15 and Prysm says LPD uses up to 75 percent less power than most other display technologies on the market. An LPD device differs significantly from LCD in that more than 90 percent of the original light is lost in the latter process. The TD2, building block of a video wall, does not suffer the problem of low brightness, contains no toxic component, has no consumables, and generates little heat. Its displays are highly configurable and can be stacked seamlessly to create supersized high-resolution video walls of almost any size or shape. According to Prysm, the LPD technology has other advantages including great black levels, a wide 180-degree viewing angle, a 65,000-hour panel life with no burn-in issues, completely recyclable components, and their production process is mercury free.[*] LPD competes with liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma display panel (PDP), surface electron display (SED) and other large-format display technologies.Desmarais, Martin. \\"Picture Perfect\\".

Known as \\"the Glacier Priest\\", he was a Jesuit priest, head of the Department of Geology at the University of Santa Clara, California, and for a time was the highest-paid lecturer in the world, leading 31 expeditions into Alaska and the Arctic. Early life Hubbard was born in San Francisco, California, on November 24, 1888, the son of George M. Hubbard (d. 1914) and Catherine Wilder Hubbard (d. 1910). His siblings were John, who became a mining engineer, and sister Mary Hubbard Stanley. Hubbard spent his childhood in Santa Cruz, California, living for a while in a house that his brother built in the mountains above Santa Cruz near Ben Lomond. The mountain house is now owned by the Lockheed Corporation and is marked with a commemorative plaque. Hubbard attended Santa Clara College from 1906 to 1908. On September 7, 1908, he entered the Society of Jesus, first studying at the Jesuit novitiate in Los Gatos 1908-1910, then at Los Angeles College 1913-1918\\\\. He then studied at the Mount Saint Michaels' Jesuit seminary in Spokane, Washington, where he received a Master of Arts degree in philosophy through Gonzaga University in 1921. Hubbard then studied theology in Innsbruck, Austria, where he was ordained a priest in 1923. During his time in Austria, he became enamored of the mountains and became known as \\"Der Gletscher Pfarrer\\" (\\"the Glacier Priest\\"). In 1925 and 1926 Hubbard completed his tertianship at St. Andrew-on-Hudson in Hyde Park, New York. Explorer and lecturer Hubbard celebrating Mass in Aniakchak In 1926, Hubbard returned to Santa Clara College as a lecturer in German, geology and theology, teaching there until 1930. Colleagues noted that \\"his heart wasn't completely in academics.\\"Scarborough, p. 9 From 1927 to 1962, Hubbard undertook regular expeditions to Alaska during the summer, touring in the winter as a lecturer. He was described as the highest-paid lecturer in the world by the Literary Digest in 1937, receiving up to $2000 per lecture. Hubbard, with the approval of his Jesuit superiors, donated the proceeds of his lectures to the Jesuit mission in Alaska. Hubbard's first trip to Alaska was a study of the Juneau Icefield. In 1929 he visited the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, sparking his interest in volcanology.Ringsmuth, Ch. 8 In 1930 he undertook the first significant expedition to the largely unknown volcanic crater at Mount Aniakchak, returning in 1931 after the Yukon trip and again in 1932. By a fortunate coincidence, there had been a moderate eruption of the Aniakchak volcano weeks before Hubbard and his party arrived on the second expedition in May 1931. On subsequent trips Hubbard explored the upper reaches of Taku Glacier and made a crossing of the Bering Strait by canoe. Another expedition in 1936 took Hubbard back to the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, farther east on the Alaska Peninsula. Surprise Lake in the Aniakchak caldera Hubbard's 1931 expedition took him down the Yukon River, visiting missions on the way. He started in the winter from Nenana with a 13-dog sled, ending at Nulato. From there he want to Unalakleet, then to the Holy Cross mission on the Yukon by April 1931. From Holy Cross, he started out for the Alaska Peninsula in a floatplane, the first airplane ride of his life and the first flight along the Bering Sea coast. Hubbard and his flight crew flew directly across the peninsula at Aniakchak, viewing the aftermath of the May 1931 eruption from the air, and nearly crashing in the process. He joined three college students who had brought the expedition's gear to Kujulik Bay on June 12. They climbed to the entrance to the crater, encountering (and killing) bears as they went. They explored the still active crater for 33 days. On the 1932 expedition, Hubbard and pilot Frank Dorbandt made the first successful landing on a lake in a volcano, landing on Surprise Lake in the Aniakchak crater. Hubbard did not enjoy the high regard of his former colleagues at Santa Clara, who complained that he made \\"outlandish blunders\\" in geology. Hubbard offered tart responses to criticisms from those he perceived as armchair academics, but through the 1930s his interests shifted to the culture of native Alaskans. Hubbard's reception from anthropologists was similar to his experience with geologists.Scarborough, pp. 10-11 Hubbard spent considerable time in 1937-38 documenting the Iñupiat and Yup'ik peoples, particularly the Iñupiat of King Island, advancing theories of linguistic relationships with Asian languages that did not find favor in scholarship.Scarborough, p. 17 Hubbard produced extensive still photographic and cinematic documentation of King Islander life, totaling 11,000 stills and of movie film. As with his photographs of volcanic features, his photographic documentation of native culture has been more enduring than his writings.Scarborough, pp. 23-26 =Lectures= A flyer for a Hubbard lecture Described as a riveting lecturer, Hubbard was skilled in the creation of early multimedia presentations using still pictures, films and his own dramatic narration. Hubbard used a writing style similar to that of Jack London, who had done his own part to popularize the Alaskan frontier in the early 20th century. A dramatic retelling of his first visit to Aniakchak by Alaskan author Barrett Willoughby entitled \\"The Moon Craters of Alaska\\" in the Saturday Evening Post made his reputation in December 1930. Following the eruption at Aniakchak in May 1931, Hubbard was invited to lecture at the Interior Department in Washington, where National Park Service director Horace M. Albright was considering Aniakchak as a new national monument.Ringsmuth, Ch.1 Hubbard's before-and-after images of Aniakchak in 1930 and 1931 – entitled in typical Hubbard prose as \\"Paradise Found\\" and \\"Paradise Lost\\" – have provided valuable baseline data for estimates of vegetative growth and recovery after volcanic activity. Hubbard compiled the movie footage he shot on his 1930-1932 expeditions into the 1933 film Aniakchak, which was distributed by Fox Studios and played worldwide. Hubbard maintained a grueling lecture schedule. In 1944-45 he gave 93 lectures in 63 days to audiences of up to 7000 people at such venues as Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., and Carnegie Hall in New York.Scarborough, p. 13 =Later career= In 1930, Hubbard had started a mutually beneficial relationship with the Alaska Packers' Association (APA), which operated salmon canneries in the region. Hubbard wrote positively about the salmon industry and produced Alaska's Silver Millions, a documentary on salmon and canneries. Hubbard received transportation and logistical assistance from the APA, and was a lobbyist for the APA in Washington while Alaskan statehood was under debate in the 1950s. During and after World War II, Hubbard advised the U.S. military on matters associated with Alaska, as well as lecturing and ministering to military personnel. Following an evening with Hubbard in late 1945, General George S. Patton described Hubbard as \\"very anti-Russian and anti-Semitic and talks very well when he forgets to advertise himself.\\" In the war years, he traveled the world to document Jesuit missions that had been damaged or destroyed during the war, raising funds for their reconstruction. In the late 1940s, he established Hubbard Laboratories (also known as Hubbard Educational Films) to produce and distribute documentaries. In 1955, Hubbard suffered a stroke in Hartford, Connecticut, followed by more in subsequent years. Hubbard appeared on the April 30, 1958, episode of This Is Your Life.Scarborough, p. 12 Death and legacy Hubbard reduced his activities until his death by his fifth stroke on May 28, 1962, at the Donohoe Infirmary at the University of Santa Clara, aged 73. Hubbard was remembered by Newsweek in this notice: > Died: The Rev. Bernard Rosencrantz Hubbard, 73, the Glacier Priest, a > tireless Jesuit who led 32 expeditions to Alaska and once listed the > requisites of an explorer as \\"a strong back, a strong stomach, a dumb head, > and a guardian angel.\\" Hubbard received honorary doctorate degrees from Marquette University in 1937 and from Trinity College of Connecticut in 1941. He wrote three books and published stories in numerous periodicals, including National Geographic and the Saturday Evening Post.

Scooter's real breakthrough came in January 2013 when he released his mixtape Street Lottery. SPIN named it \\"Rap release of the week\\" and XXL featured it on its \\"Best mixtapes of January\\" list. Eric Diep of XXL called Scooter \\"one of the hottest street rappers coming out of Atlanta\\" and wrote that tracks like the single \\"Colombia\\" and \\"Street Lottery\\" (featuring Bun B) are \\"proof of his undeniable talent\\". The tape was also a viral success gaining over 100,000 downloads on DatPiff. The official video for \\"Colombia\\", directed by Decatur Dan, premiered on MTV on January 31. The song became a hit in the south, especially in Scooter's hometown Atlanta. Brandon Soderberg of SPIN classified it as a mix of Rick Ross' \\"Hustlin'\\" and Future's \\"Tony Montana\\". By the end of the month, an official remix with rappers Rick Ross, Birdman and Gucci Mane was released. Lil Wayne also covered the song for his mixtape Dedication 5. The rapper's recent success prompted OnSmash to state \\"the buzz for Scooter is at an all- time high.\\" On April 8, Scooter was arrested for violation of parole. Scooter's collaboration mixtape with Gucci Mane Free Bricks 2 was released on February 28, 2013. On August 29, 2013, Young Scooter released his mixtape From The Cell Block To Your Block, featuring guest appearances from Future, Gucci Mane, Wale, YG, Lil Boosie, Webbie and Lil Phat, among others. Musical style Scooter is known for his freestyle type of rapping, without writing down his lyrics, similarly to Gucci Mane. He has defined his style as \\"count music,\\" and explained it in an interview with Complex: \\"I don't really care what I say on a beat as long as it's about some money. When you try to think hard and write it out, that's when it's gonna be fucked up.\\" Scooter's lyrical themes are largely about money and drugs. David Drake of Complex compared his \\"populist, kingpin rapping\\" to that of Young Jeezy, although he noted that Scooter doesn't have the \\"all-encompassing grandiosity\\" of his fellow Atlanta rapper. Scooter is influenced by famous hip-hop artists such as Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Diddy. Legal issues Young Scooter was arrested for probation violation during a traffic stop in DeKalb County, Georgia, on April 8, 2013. According to HipHopDX, Scooter shared a jail cell with frequent collaborator Gucci Mane, who was arrested for probation violation on April 12, 2013. Scooter spent six months behind bars before being released in mid-October 2013. On March 2, 2015, Young Scooter was released off probation.

It was once considered to be a subspecies of the Large Tree Mouse. Deforestation is posing a threat to the species, but it has been suspected that the species has some degree of tolerance towards disturbance of its habitat.  Taxonomy  The D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago pogonomys is often confused to be a subspecies of the large tree mouse (P. lorie), of which it shares a genus. the D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago pogonomys was referred to as a separate species of pogonomys in Laurie and Hill's (1954) checklist, but was referred to as a subspecies of the Large Tree Mouse by Dennis and Menzies (1979), Flannery (1990b), Flannery (1995a), and Musser and Carleton (1993). Flannery (1995b) noted that \\"fergussoniensis is very distinctive, being very large and having a reddish rather than gray dorsum. I suspect that further studies will reveal it to represent a distinct species.\\" The D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago pogonomys has a larger body and skull size, as well as brownish red upperparts, buffy gray underparts, and sleek fur. The Large Tree Mouse has a dark brownish gray dorsal coat, white underparts, and woolly fur. The taxonomic relationship between the D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago pognomys and the greater tree-mouse (Chiruromys forbesi) has yet to be resolved.  Range and population  The D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago pogonomys is endemic to Papua New Guinea, specifically the D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago. The species has been recorded on Fergusson Island, Goodenough Island, and Normanby Island. This species of pogonomys is terrestrial, with specimens collected at the \\"oak-rainforest transition\\" and climbing in vegetation close to a village. The population has been rarely collected, and there are few known specimens of the species; the population is believed, however, to be decreasing.  Conservation status  The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently lists the D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago pogonomys as an endangered species due to the extent of occurrence being less than five thousand square kilometers, the presence of individuals in fewer than six locations, continuing deforestation in its habitat, and the decreasing population of mature individuals. It has been suspected, but not confirmed, that the species is tolerant of some disturbance to its habitat. Because the islands are being converted to grassland for subsistence farming, deforestation is a major threat to the population of the species. It is unknown if the D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago pogonomys is present in any protected areas, and further studies need to be conducted in distribution, abundance, natural history, habitat status, and threats.

Азербайджанский ковер. Том III. Баку: \\"Гянджлик\\", 1983, стр. 221. Carpets The name of this carpet is related to the Şamkənd, Ərikli, Kürdhacı, Chorman and Shalva villages of the Lachin Rayon of Azerbaijan. Gasimushaghi carpets are broadly spread in carpet weaving points of the “Carpet weaving schools of Karabakh”. Earlier it was woven in a village called Gasimushaghi obasi and its production also developed in this village and especially in Şamkənd, Ərikli, Kürdhacı, Chorman and Shalva villages. Development in production of these carpets in these villages based on rich raw materials and ancient history of handicraft traditions. Gasimushaghi obasi village provided its residents with special raw materials such as wool and natural colors made of plants. These carpets are also unique and are still saved in several museums of the world. The medallion-carpets of Karabakh such as “Darya-nur”, “Khanlig”, “Karabakh”, “Chelebi”, “Malibeyli” and “Gasimushaghi” make up a peculiar group of Karabakh carpets. Some centuries ago, ornaments of the “Gasimushaghi carpets” were used in embroidery and called “Gasimushaghi embroideries”.Вышивание Гасымушагы Then these embroidery ornaments were used in Gasimushaghi carpets and that is why these carpets are also called “Embroidery carpets”.\\"Ненелеримизин ядикары\\", журнал «Лачин юрду\\", №1 (4) 2012, Баку, издательство \\"Бахтияр-4\\". стр-17. Artistic analysis Silk embroideries of Gasimushaghi carpets. Masterly made arrangement of ornamentations of the whole composition of the central part of Gasimushaghi carpets arouse interest. No part of the background of the middle and external area of the carpet stayed unused. Traditionally, long-staple wool, called “yapaghi” was used in weaving of Gasimushaghi carpets. Generally, seven natural colors such as white, black, deep red, deep blue, green, yellow and brown are used in the weaving of these carpets. Gasimushaghi carpets have deep red background with deep blue middle area. There is a large medallion consisted of various figures, details and elements in the center of the carpet. Upper and lower corners of Gasimushaghi carpets are woven from white wool and are S-shaped (“gol”). S-shaped corners are peculiar for Gasimushaghi carpets and there is an appearance of a dragon in these S-shaped corners. Sometimes these carpets are called “Aggol khalcha” (Carpet with white hands) by local population. All other ornaments are woven with a hook and it is believed that these ornaments defend people from evil spirits. Structure and technical features Carpet-weaving instruments used in \\"Gasimushaghi obasi\\" village. Like other carpets of Karabakh’s carpet weaving school such as “Khanlig”, “Bahmanli”, “Garagoyunlu” and “Talish”, Gasimushaghi carpets also are dense, with high level of knots, soft and light. Turkbaf knot is considered the basis of Gasimushaghi carpets. Dimensions of Gasimushagi carpets are generally, from 200x120 to 230x160, but sometimes they can be larger. Density of knots varies from 30x30 to 40x40 (from 90000 to 160000 knots in a sq.meter).Лятиф Керимов. Азербайджанский ковер. Том III. Баку: \\"Гянджлик\\", 1983, стр. 223.

Board of Education (1954).North Carolina Advisory Committee on Education. The Pearsall Plan to Save Our Schools. (Raleigh, 1956.) http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/ref/collection/CivilRights/id/533 Many southern states were challenged by the Brown ruling as they faced opposition to integration from residents. North Carolina decided to highlight moderation, acknowledging that school integration was inevitable, rather than promoting active resistance like Alabama, Virginia, and other southern states.Douglas, Davison. Reading, Writing, and Race: The Desegregation of Charlotte Schools. (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1995.), 32 To find a creative solution, the North Carolina Advisory Committee on Education established the Pearsall Committee, named after its chairman, Thomas J. Pearsall, a landholder and notable public figure from Rocky Mount.Pearsall, Elizabeth. Interview by Walter E. Campbell. Oral Histories of the American South, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. May 25, 1988. The Pearsall Committee created the Pearsall Plan, which was intended to gradually integrate the North Carolina public school system. Some observers believe this scheme hindered the fight for equality for students across the state for years. Others believe that the resulting legislation helped the society adapt to the drastic social changes related to school integration. Terms of the Pearsall Plan Rather than having the North Carolina State Board of Education direct the pace of integration, the Pearsall Plan decentralized decisionmaking to the individual local school boards, which were dominated by whites, as most blacks were still disenfranchised, dating from a 1900 suffrage amendment, and were prevented from running for office or voting.North Carolina Advisory Committee on Education. The Pearsall Plan to save our schools. (Raleigh, 1956.) http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/ref/collection/CivilRights/id/533 The Pupil Assignment Act, which preceded the Pearsall Plan, provided for parents to receive a monetary grant if a child was placed into a mixed school against their wishes.Carlson, Arthur Larentz. \\"With All Deliberate Speed: The Pearsall Plan and School Desegregation in North Carolina, 1954-1966\\" (Master's Thesis, East Carolina University, 2011.)http://thescholarship.ecu.edu/bitstream/handle/10342/3554/Carlson_ecu_0600M_10429.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y Under the Pearsall Plan, many school districts maintained segregated schools and denied the transfer applications of black students to white schools.Carlson It also provided that any child not accepted to a private school, and who was placed into a mixed public school, would not be forced to attend school.North Carolina Advisory Committee on Education. \\"The Pearsall Plan to save our schools.\\" (Raleigh, 1956.) http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/ref/collection/CivilRights/id/533 The community could evaluate schools and shut down any it considered \\"intolerable\\" by a vote.North Carolina Advisory Committee on Education Thus, a predominantly white neighborhood could vote to shut down a mixed school if they felt it unfit for their children to share its classrooms. According to the Pearsall Committee, their proposition was, \\"the building of a new school system on a new foundation – a foundation of no racial segregation by law, but assignment according to natural racial preference and the administrative determination of what is best for the child.\\"Douglas, Davison. Reading, Writing, and Race: The Desegregation of Charlotte Schools. (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1995), 32 The Committee believed that segregation of schools was natural and students could continue to prosper without the aid of laws. (The lack of African-American representation in the state legislature and local offices resulted in the continual underfunding of black schools and other facilities, showing that white students \\"could continue to prosper\\".) The struggle for unified schools in North Carolina continued for the next two decades, ultimately resulting in the integration of schools. Defiance of the government Many critics cite the wording of the Pearsall Plan as evidence of it expressing defiance of the Supreme Court rather than being an effort to accomplish desegregation. They consider the title of \\"the Pearsall Plan to Save our Schools\\" as implying the Court was destroying the public school system by its ruling. They suggest that the document is intended to question the ruling of the Supreme Court, rather than implement its direction. Suggesting that integration will lead to situations in which schools become \\"intolerable\\" seems to show that the Pearsall Plan was intended to halt rather than moderate integration. The question and answer section of the Plan states that the legislative action was not a defiance of the US Supreme Court's decision; rather, it was \\"an attempt to stay within that decision, even though a great majority of our citizens disapprove of the Supreme Court's ruling.\\"North Carolina Advisory Committee on Education. The Pearsall Plan to Save our Schools. (Raleigh, 1956.) http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/ref/collection/CivilRights/id/533 Persuaded that the ruling was not what the \\"community\\" wanted, the Pearsall Committee developed a plan that minimized the ruling's effects. The \\"answer\\" section claims that the Supreme Court abused its power by ruling on public education, believed to belong to the states. Some opponents were bitter about states rights arguments. Necessity of the Plan The Pearsall Committee recognized that the integration of schools was inevitable and would result in social changes. The Pearsall Committee, especially Thomas Pearsall, believed they needed to prepare a plan to help the state prepare for change. Pearsall's son, Mack, said his father had anticipated, \\"a very tension filled environment – a major change in lifestyles and folkways and mores.\\"Pearsall, Mack. Interview by Walter E. Campbell. Oral Histories of the American South, (Chapel Hill, North Carolina. May 25, 1988.), 31 The committee tried to create a plan that would enable only as much action as the people of North Carolina wanted. They believed rushing into wholesale change would result in chaos. That was avoided, but, by allowing communities not to make any changes, in many places, there were multiple years of stagnancy after the release of the Pearsall Plan, during which nothing was accomplished. The Committee had tried to find the right balance between action and chaos.Douglas (1995). Reading, Writing, and Race, p. 50 Political implications Strategically, the Pearsall Plan decentralized decision making to the school boards, which also enabled elected politicians to get out of the middle of the fight. Handing responsibility to the school boards enabled politicians to escape the spotlight and maintain an ostensibly neutral stance on school desegregation. According to one resident, the state's decision to let the local town boards decide was to \\"make it clear that the state itself, from Raleigh, is not masterminding or trying to assure a particular result.\\"Giles, Robert. Interview by Jay Jenkins. Chapel Hill, North Carolina. September 10, 1987 By doing this, the state school board also escaped having to make a controversial decision, which would likely be criticized from either or both sides. Criticisms of the Plan The African- American community criticized the amendments because they appeared to help whites and provide few or no benefits to African-American students. Critics criticized the unequal representation of the races on the Pearsall Committee as the primary reason for the unbalanced plan. They believed that a committee with sixteen white and three black citizens could not fairly represent society.Korstad, Robert Rodgers. To Write These Wrongs: The North Carolina Fund and the Battle to End Poverty. (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1995), p. 35 Regulations related to the Plan proved a barrier to black students and some whites. A student wishing to challenge their assignment had to contact their school board directly; no independent bodies were keeping track of complaints to evaluate the performance of school boards as a whole. The appeals process required submission of materials related to distinct and detailed clauses that were difficult for uneducated and under- educated parents to fill out. If students' appeals were not correctly submitted, the boards would reject their requests. As a result of these factors, \\"most school boards denied every request filed by a black student to transfer from an assigned black school to a white school\\" until the early 1960s.Douglas (1995). Reading, Writing, and Race, p. 51 Only one family was granted a monetary voucher for being placed into an integrated school. North Carolina lagged behind Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia in terms of the pace of enrolling black students in integrated schools.Peebles-Wilkins, Wilma. Reactions of Segments of the Black Community to the North Carolina Pearsall Plan, 1954 – 1966. (Clark Atlanta University, 2002.) https://www.jstor.org/stable/274775?seq=4, 119 Many African Americans in North Carolina were dismayed by the lack of progress, as they had been hopeful about the Brown ruling being a catalyst for school integration. Reaction toward the Plan Though many people supported the integration of schools in principle, they were wary about the implications of quick social change. The Pearsall Plan seemed to reject any social change. A poll released in February 1956 stated that forty-seven percent of African Americans in the South did not support the Brown ruling because they feared their children would be spurned and not afforded a truly fair education from white teachers.Douglas (1995), Reading, Writing, and Race, 51 At the same time, they did not support the Pearsall Plan because it had the potential to halt the trend toward change altogether. Benjamin L. Smith, the white superintendent of Greensboro schools wrote, \\"After careful deliberation it is my opinion that desegregation is an idea whose hour has arrived.\\"Smith, Benjamin Lee. \\"Report of the Superintendent to the Greensboro City Board of Education regarding Brown v. Board of Education.\\" Greensboro, 1956. http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/ref/collection/CivilRights/id/547 He believed that North Carolina and the US were ready for desegregation to begin. He cautioned against moving too fast, saying, \\"Three hundred years of social distinctions have established customs and traditions that cannot and ought not be overthrown over night.\\"Smith =Impact on Charlotte= Though in general, the sentiments regarding the Pearsall Plan were similar throughout North Carolina, the results of school integration would have a wider ranging effect on the city of Charlotte. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Charlotte was completely segregated, both in schools and in the entire culture of the city.Douglas, Davison. Reading, Writing, and Race: The Desegregation of Charlotte Schools. (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1995.), 50 There was even a divide between the parts of town where the blacks lived and where the whites lived. Thus, when Brown was passed, the effort to desegregate in Charlotte revolved around a complete culture revolution rather than just a change in the education system. The NAACP was integral in helping to advocate for black students in their attempts to attend the predominantly white schools, which had better resources for their students.Douglas, 63 However, despite this backing, there was harsh criticism of the idea that schools could simply be integrated because there was such a massive difference in the cultures of the students. The vast majority of the applicants that attempted to switch into the better funded schools were rejected and segregation in the city continued. Finally, during the summer of 1957, the Charlotte School Board agreed to enact voluntary desegregation to avoid further national or state-ordered mandates.Douglas, 64 The effort turned out to be relatively unsuccessful as the protesters at Harry Harding High School received national attention for their protest of the enrollment of Dorothy Counts, embarrassing the city leaders. They crowded around the doors to the school in an attempt to prevent Dorothy from entering, resulting in two arrests. This misconduct, however, would fuel a series of successful and peaceful desegregation efforts as blacks and whites worked together to reform the city's reputation and end segregation throughout the city. Thomas Pearsall's regret Thomas J. Pearsall, who is most credited for the Pearsall Plan, would later regret leading such an important and controversial decision in the integration of schools. After falling ill with lymphoma, Pearsall reflected on how the actions of the committee had affected everyone. His wife noted that in his waning days, Pearsall's interactions with black people became more strained as he felt that he had done wrong to them. He was quoted saying, \\"I don't want to go to my grave feeling that I haven't done the best I could for the blacks.\\"Pearsall, Elizabeth. Interview by Walter E. Campbell. Oral Histories of the American South, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. May 25, 1988. Though others reassured him that he did in fact, do everything possible to appease everyone, evidence shows he, himself, did not believe this to be completely true. This is perhaps due to the fact that at the time of his death, in 1981, the majority of the schools in North Carolina had been forced to integrate, often ending in clashes between the races. However, despite the tremendous guilt he experienced, Pearsall's reputation remained relatively clean. He is highly regarded for his work with the Pearsall Plan despite setting back the integration of North Carolina schools a number of years. This is an indication that people did not blame Pearsall but rather the local prejudices that ultimately would hinder the ability for everyone to access equal opportunities. His son, Mack Pearsall, noted that his father dedicated a portion of his life working towards equality for all people and struggled when producing the Pearsall Plan because he feared he would go down in history as an enemy of the black community.Pearsall, Mack. Interview by Walter E. Campbell. Oral Histories of the American South, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. May 25, 1988. Though Pearsall stalled the ability of blacks to gain equal educational opportunities, many people still claim that his actions were necessary in preventing the chaos from erupting from the Brown v. Board of Education result.

This was considered as a form of reparations in addition to monetary compensation and employment of workers. Territorial demands by Luxembourg Our river was ceded by the French military administration on April 23, 1949. This included former territory (indicated by Alter Grenzverlauf, former border) and the Kammerwald. The territorial demands of the ruling Luxemburgian National Union Government were made known in late summer 1945. Luxembourg required Germany to relinquish German territory that had been separated from the former Duchy of Luxembourg under the terms of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, and the further extension of Luxembourg to the Saar River. Only a portion of the population of Luxembourg was in agreement with these concepts of a \\"Greater Luxembourg\\". In support of this territorial claim, in November 1945 troops of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg occupied a small zone of their own within the actual French occupation zone, installing two garrisons. In a memorandum dated November 27, 1946, the Government of Luxembourg stated that the border be relocated between into German territory. An area of was affected, including all or part of the German border districts of Bitburg, Our, Saarburg, and Prüm, the population of which was 31,188 people. The area constituted approximately 20% of the territory that Luxembourg had ceded to Prussia in 1815. Similarly to those of Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, these territorial demands were refused by the three primary Allied powers--the USA, the United Kingdom, and the USSR --with reference to the considerable problems posed by supplying the needs of the 14 million refugees from the annexed eastern territories of the former Reich who were already present in their respective zones of occupation. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg nonetheless persisted in its territorial demands. London Six-Power Conference Under Article 4 of the London Six-Power Conference of June 7, 1948, \\"Preliminary Territorial Agreements\\", the following was noted: \\"The delegations have agreed to submit to their governments suggestions concerning certain minor provisional territorial adjustments in connection with the western borders of Germany.\\" The Government of France implemented this decision of the London Conference as follows: under Order No. 212 of the French Military Government of April 23, 1949, the incorporation into the territory of Luxembourg of the Kammerwald together with the settlement of Roth an der Our and the estate of Neuscheuerhof (Bauler) was declared. The area in question consisted of near the Luxembourg settlement of Vianden. Shortly thereafter Luxembourg declined to annex Roth and Neuscheuerhof, so that only the uninhabited area of the Kammerwald was separated from Germany. Return of the territory In the agreement of July 11, 1959, between the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the penitent Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg conclusively renounced its claim to the area of the Kammerwald and returned the territory to the Federal Republic of Germany, which in return paid 58.3 million DM to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

The work was commissioned in 1970 by art collector Roger Davidson and installed on his family property. Shift consists of six large concrete forms, each 20 centimetres thick and 1.5 metres high, zigzagging over the northwest portion of the property's rolling countryside. In 1990 the Township of King voted to designate Shift and the surrounding land as a protected cultural landscape under the Ontario Heritage Act. The property is now owned by a Toronto-based developer who announced in 2010 that they appeal the decision of the Ontario Conservation Review board with plans to develop the property for housing, necessitating the removal of Shift. In 2013 the Township of King voted to prepare a bylaw to designate Shift as protected under the Ontario Heritage Act, preventing its destruction or alteration. History In the summer of 1970 Serra and artist Joan Jonas visited the site, a 13-acre potato farm in King Township. They discovered that if two people walked the distance of the land towards each other while keeping each other in view, they had to negotiate the contours of the land and walked in a zigzagged path. This determined the topographical definition of the space and the finished work would be the maximum distance two people could occupy while still in view of one another. The sculpture's construction began in 1970 and ended in 1972. In 1973 Serra discussed Shift in Art in America: > What I wanted was a dialectic between one's perception of the place in > totality and one's relation to the field as walked. The result is a way of > measuring oneself against the indeterminancy of the land. As one follows the > work farther into the field, one is forced to shift and turn with the work > and look back across the elevational drop. From the top of the hill, looking > back across he valley, images and thoughts are remembered which were > initiated by the consciousness of having experienced them. The land was owned by the family of Roger Davidson, an art collector. Serra approached Davidson with an idea to use the land for a site-specific sculpture. Davidson agreed in exchange for two of Serra's smaller sculptures. Ownership of the work was undetermined and as there was no contract, Serra understood that the work would be preserved on the land by the Davidson family and that the land would not be sold and would be accessible to the public. In 1974, the land, registered in Davidson's mother's name, was sold to Hickory Hill Investments, a land developer. Land registry records made no mention of an artwork on the property. The Ontario government listed the land as protected under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act as a green space, while Shift is protected under Canadian copyright law as Serra is a landowner in Nova Scotia. The Toronto-based developer announced in 2010 planned to develop the property for housing. Shift and the surrounding land was designated a protected cultural landscape under the Ontario Heritage Act. In 2013 the Township of King voted to prepare a bylaw to designate Shift as protected under the Ontario Heritage Act, preventing its destruction or alteration. Description Shift is made of concrete, the first of two concrete works Serra has created. He considers concrete to be too architectural for sculpture and usually works in steel. In both cases, Serra used concrete owing to the architectural scale of the works and the horizontal emphasis. Each of the six concrete sections is 60 inches in height and 8 inches in width while the length varies from 90 feet to 240 feet. These were built based on a land survey that Serra had commissioned. The sculpture is divided into two sections each containing three segments. Shift was ignored for the most part by locals since the Davidsons sold the land. Residents thought it was a leftover foundation and the work survived in obscurity until talk of developing the land in the 1990s brought attention to the work's importance. The developers did not realize the value of the work when the land was purchased. Serra's studio estimates that a commission of this nature would now be valued at between US$7 and US$8 million. Although protected from development, the sculpture is the target of vandalism and environmental exposure. In 2018, the sculpture was found to have cracks and scratches, as well as the \\"encroachment of weeds\\". No maintenance is performed on the sculpture.

It is a pilgrimage center for both Hindus and Buddhists. The lake within the wetland which reflects emerald waters has a circumference of about and boats are operated. On the periphery of the lake there is the Maipokhari Botanical Garden of horticultural and ecological importance which houses a rock garden, an orchid house, plants collected from many regions of eastern Nepal, and a green house. Geography View of the lake in Mai Pokhari The wetland is in the middle hill ranges of the Himalayas at an elevation of about and covers an area of . It is about to the north of Ilam. The wetland has been created due to ground subsidence. The source of water in the wetland is from natural springs and precipitation. It is the main source of fresh water for local people. Flora and fauna Goldfish The wetland's flora consists of Schima, Castanopsis, laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia) and epiphytic orchids. Water lilly, cone trees, rhododendrons, and herbal plants also occur. Faunal species include white-rumped vulture, leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), Eurasian otter (Lutra Lutra), and endemic Variegated mountain lizard (Japalura variegata). Invasion of gold fish (Carassius auratus) has adversely affected the indigenous fauna. There are also 300 species of birds recorded in the wetland. The wetlands's lentic environment of bottom-fauna is in its natural status with a stratification of abundant Chironomids. Threats The threats faced by the wetland relate to introduced invasive species, occupation of forest area, haphazard construction activity, proliferation of human settlement on the tracks leading to the wetland. Other threats identified are the use of pesticides in tea plantation in the watershed, and loss of habitat on account of growing crops such as cardamom, bouquet grass, and horticulture activities on the slopes of the wetland. Conservation In order to promote conservation awareness among the stake holders and the local people, measures undertaken have included establishing a Code of Conduct, monitoring of water quality and key species, and instituting a Management Plan on the basis of ecological and socio- cultural studies. \\"Apart from the local community agencies involved with this work are the Ilam District Forest Office, the Ilam District Development Committee, the Department of Forests, the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, local eco-clubs of local students, local conservation centers and specialists\\".

In 1790 he became Electoral Chancellor and Minister, and headed the last Imperial election in 1792. When the armies of Revolutionary France began making incursions into Germany in 1794 he represented the general arming of the people against the French occupation. He organised the defensive Landsturm (Militia) of Mainz and surroundings. Albini was a representative at the Congress of Rastatt 1797. On the re-opening of hostilities in 1799 he was given the rank of Feldzeugmeister in the Austrian Army and appointed to command a 20,000-man corps of German volunteers raised on the right bank of the Rhine under Graf Sztaray. In this capacity he attacked the French under Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers in September and re-captured Frankfurt-am-Main, before threatening the French garrison of Mainz.

Life He is stated to have been the son of ‘a natural Italian', but of his early life nothing definite is known. He was generally believed to have relations in Florence, where he certainly had many correspondents. He matriculated as a pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, 27 April 1559, but left the university without proceeding to a degree. On 7 April 1571 Lord Burghley was informed that Bryskett was temporarily filling the office of clerk of the council in Ireland under Sir Henry Sidney. Before 1572 he had become the intimate friend of Sir Henry Sidney's son, Philip Sidney, and he was young Sidney's companion on a three years' continental tour through Germany, Italy, and Poland (1572–1575). In 1577, he became clerk of the chancery for the faculties in Ireland, an office in which he was succeeded by Edmund Spenser. Afterwards (1582), he received from Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton the appointment of secretary of the Munster council. About the same time he made the acquaintance of the poet Spenser, Lord Grey's secretary, and Spenser relieved the tedium of official life by teaching his new friend Greek. Bryskett remained in Munster for many years. In 1594, he sought to be reappointed clerk of the Irish council, but failing to obtain that post he was granted the ‘clerkship of the casualties’ in the following year. In 1600, Sir Robert Cecil wrote to Sir George Carew in his behalf, and described him as ‘an ancient servitor of the realm of Ireland, and now employed by her majesty beyond the seas.’ He had an interest in Bridgetown Abbey, which Cecil asked Carew to secure to him. In 1606, he was reputed to hold large estates in Dublin, Cavan, and Cork. He is stated to have been alive in 1611. Literary friendship Bryskett is more interesting as the friend of Sidney and Spenser than as an Irish official. His chief original literary work was a translation from the Italian of Baptista Giraldo's philosophical treatise, which he entitled A Discourse of Civill Life, containing the Ethike Part of Morall Philosophie. It was not published till 1606, but was certainly written full twenty years earlier. (There are two editions, both dated 1606—one printed for W. Aspley and the other for E. Blount.) The book is dedicated to Lord Grey, and opens with an Introduction which is of unique interest in English literature. Bryskett describes a party of friends met at his cottage near Dublin, among whom were Dr. John Long, archbishop of Armagh, Captain Christopher Carleill, Captain Thomas Norris, Captain Warham St Leger, and Mr. Edmund Spenser, ‘once your lordship's secretary.' In the course of conversation Bryskett says that he envics ‘the happinesse of the Italians' who have popularised moral philosophy by translating and explaining Plato and Aristotle in their own language. He expresses a wish that English writers would follow the Italian example. Addressing Spenser, Bryskett entreats the poet to turn his great knowledge of philosophy to such account, and as a beginning to give them a philosophical lecture on the spot. Spenser declines to comply with the request on the ground that he had already undertaken The Faerie Queene, 'a work tending to the same effect'; and finally the poet invites Bryskett to read to the company his own translation of Giraldo, which Bryskett willingly consents to do. Bryskett includes in the published work a few remarks made by Spenser in the course of the reading on various philosophical problems discussed in the book. Soon after Sidney's death, in 1586, Spenser collected a series of elegies under the title of Astrophel. To this collection, which was published with 'Colin Clout come home again' in 1595, Bryskett contributed two elegies. One of his poems is entitled 'A Pastorall Æclogue', and is signed with his initials; the other is called 'The Mourning Muse of Thestylis'. These two pieces were entered in the Stationers' Register as 'The Mourning Muses of Lod. Bryskett upon the deathe of the most noble sir Philip Sydney, knight', and licensed to the printer, John Wolfe, on 22 August 1587. But they do not appear to have been published separately. In Spenser's collected sonnets, Amoretti and Epithalamion (1595), the one numbered 33 is addressed to Bryskett. Spenser here apologises to his friend for his delay in completing the Faerie Queene.

To the present day, i Sebastiani has performed for thousands of fans across the United States and Canada. The company has travelled as far as Montreal to the north, Miami to the south, and Texas to the west, performing more than 100 different improvisational scenarios.Eisele (2003): \\"Since its inception back in 1990, the company has bounced around from Montreal to Texas, performing more than 50 different shows and honing their improvisational style.\\" i Sebastiani presently operates out of Boston, MA. They specialize in performances for educational institutions, historical organizations, and the general public. The troupe frequently performs to packed crowds at the Charles River Museum of Industry in Waltham, MA.Bostiano (2013) A portion of the proceeds from recent shows have gone towards the repair of flooding damage. The damage was incurred by the Museum during historic rainfall in spring of 2010, when the Charles River reached a century high-water level. History i Sebastiani was founded on June 4, 1990 as a splinter organization of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). Founder Jeff Hatalsky's stated objective was to drive the group towards greater authenticity. In September 2001, i Sebastiani attended the Austin Commedia dell'Arte Festival in Austin Texas, where they were met with acclaim. From 1991 through September 2001, the Troupe had performed each Commedia dell'Arte scenario only once, but as demand for Commedia built, i Sebastiani began to perform multiple times with each scenario. In October 1996, Jeff Hatalsky left the troupe, and it began a period of attempted democracy. This mode of organization imposed natural limitations, and through reform Alex Newman stepped beyond his role as coordinator to become the troupe's new Capocomico (manager). In October 2002, the troupe expanded beyond SCA events and began to perform for the general public. i Sebastiani's Florida debut came at the Miami Improv Festival in 2006. Octavio Roca of the Miami New Times commented of the troupe that: Historical Authenticity Unlike many modern Commedia troupes, i Sebastiani attempts to make their performances authentic to the original 16th century Commedia time period. To maintain integrity of the historical genre, the troupe's scenarios are usually recreations of recorded historical scenarios. The published works of the 16th-century Commedia playwright Flaminio Scala provide one of the key sources for this material. Scenarios which are not adapted from the original time period are written in adherence to the maxims of historical scenarios and attempt to authentically portray the genre. iSebastiani's props are also created for time-period accuracy using similar materials & methods. The making of Commedia's signature leather masks is a specialty studied by several troupe members for the purpose of making authentic costumes. Because of Commedia's influence on western theatre, many elements of Commedia are broadly recognizable by modern audiences.

Biography Born in Philadelphia in 1934, Ruth Fredman Cernea (née Gruber) got her BA degree in English literature from Temple University, created and raised a family, and returned to Temple University to complete her graduate studies. After gaining a doctorate in cultural anthropology, she became the Director for Publications and Research at the national headquarters of the Hillel Foundation for Jewish Campus Life (national headquarters). Previous positions include: * Director of Research and Publications (1982–96) of the Hillel Foundation * Chief Editor of the multiyear guide “Jewish Life on Campus” * President of the Washington Association of Professional Anthropologists (WAPA), 2001–02 Key publications The monograph “The Passover Seder: Afikoman in Exile – An Anthropological Perspective on Jewish Culture” (1980) established Ruth Fredman Cernea as a subtle interpreter of Jewish cultural and religious symbols, and of popular myths. She argued that the symbolism embedded in the Passover ritual expresses the political celebration of freedom and the cultural quest for purity. Published in several editions, the book remains in print as the only systematic anthropological examination of Passover's religious and secular symbols. Interested in the cultural transformation of Jewish immigrants in the US, she devoted five years to research among Jewish immigrants from North Africa living in Washington DC, the result of which was her thesis on \\"Cosmopolitans at Home: The Sephardic Jews of Washington D.C.2 (1982).Temple University Library. Ruth Fredman PhD Thesis. Microfiche. As noted by the Washington Post, \\"Dr. Cernea was on her second honeymoon in 1987 when she discovered a little-known Jewish community in Myanmar (Burma) and the country’s only synagogue, the historic Mushmeah Yeshua Temple.\\" That discovery spurred her enduring interest and she devoted almost 20 years to research and piece together the history of Burma's Jewish community, a thriving pre-World War II community decimated by the war and numbering now only a handful of people. To reconstruct that community's history and culture, Cernea traveled to all places where small groups of descendants of Burma's Jewish community are known to live: India, Australia, Israel, United Kingdom, and California, interviewing scores of families of Jewish Burmese ancestry and gathering family histories, documents, pictures, diaries, and personal recollections. Her tenacity salvaged from oblivion and reconstructed the history of Burma's Jewish community in the only existing monograph on that community, Almost Englishmen: Baghdadi Jews in British Burma (2007). Cernea's interest for culture produced another unique work, entitled The Great Latke-Hamantash DebateLatke–Hamantash Debate (2006). That is an anthology of selected speeches delivered by Jewish and non-Jewish scholars in a long series of mock debates started at the University of Chicago more than half a century ago and continuing today through debates organized in many universities across the United States and Canada, as well as in a number of synagogues. The book includes mock \\"scholarly arguments\\" delivered in live public contests between \\"supporters\\" of the Latke, the potato pancake traditionally served during the holiday of Hanukkah, and \\"supporters\\" of the Hamatasch, the triangular sweet pastry associated with the holiday of Purim. Among the presenters in her book are some of the most eminent American academics, including Milton Friedman and Leon Lederman, both Nobel laureates respectively in economics and physics, historian Hana Grey, philosopher Martha Nussbaum, and some other 30 scholars. These debaters construct the most absurd possible arguments to demonstrate the alleged superiority of the Latke or the Hamatasch vis-à-vis each other. The book is credited with the recent multiplication of the annual Latke-Hamatasch humorous debates across the US. In a nice turn of phrase, Dr. Cernea told the Chicago Tribune in 2005 that \\"Jewish humor is not silly, but it is absurd absurdity. In Jewish thought absurdity and humor is particularly an antidote to seriousness. Jews have always been able to use humor to lighten the load.\\" FootnotesReferences * \\"Ruth Fredman Cernea, 74, Dies; Anthropologist Wrote About Jewish Culture\\", Washington Post, April 7, 2009, p.

He is a recognized authority on the stage work of American filmmaker Orson Welles. His publication, The Theatre of Orson Welles,Bucknell University Press, 1977 which received a CHOICE Outstanding Academic Book Award in 1979,CHOICE, May 1979 (vol. 16, no. 3), pp. 335 and 343 has been called \\"a landmark study\\" and has been translated into Japanese.Koda-sha, Tokyo, 1983 His 1990 companion volume, Orson Welles on ShakespeareRoutledge, 2001 has been praised by Welles critics and biographers. Early years Richard France was born Richard Zagami in Boston, Massachusetts, son of N. Roy Zagami, a U.S. Army officer, and Rita Foster Zagami. His father's military postings led France to spend nearly half of his early years abroad: in Japan (1947–49), Australia (1949–50), and Germany (1953–57). France dropped out of high school in 1955 in Kaiserslauten and returned to the United States, where he began working at odd jobs, including apprentice trophy maker, radio announcer, and encyclopedia salesman. The resonant, expressive voice that would make France a sought-after narrator and voice-over performer was already evident when he found employment in the mail room at NBC Studios, and was chosen to participate in the NBC Radio Workshop, whose members were coached and mentored by many of the network's distinguished announcing staff. While never attending college at the undergraduate level, France was admitted to the Yale School of Drama as a Special Fellow in Playwriting (1964–66). From there, he went on to earn an M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing (1970) and a Ph.D. in Theatre History / Dramatic Literature (1973) from Carnegie-Mellon University. Career beginnings While serving as a psychiatric aide in New York (1958–59), France met Czechoslovakian playwright Mirko Tuma, a survivor of the Nazi concentration camp Terezin. Tuma, who had not previously written in English, suggested that they collaborate on a play, with France's native fluency complementing Tuma's playwriting skills. The Walk (later retitled Don't You Know It's Raining?) received four Broadway options between 1960 and 1971 and premiered at the Dallas Theatre Center, in cooperation with the Rockefeller- funded Office for Advanced Drama Research,Where not specifically footnoted, the source for references to literary works is the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Twentieth-Century American Dramatists, Part 1: A-J, \\"Richard France;\\" Thomson Gale, 1980, pp. 191-6. The source for other unattributed information is Richard France. in August 1970. Playwriting and production In the spring of 1960 France left New York City for San Francisco. He would remain there for four years, writing fourteen plays whose central characters, \\"eccentric outsiders … locked in open conflict with the established order, which eventually destroys them,\\" would reappear in his later work. His one-act play, The Image of Elmo Doyle, premiered at the Yale School of Drama in October 1964, and was staged at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Arts in New York in June 1965, translated into Japanese by the prominent Japanese playwright and scholar Masakazu Yamazaki, and staged at the Walnut Theatre in Tokyo in October 1970. (Yamazaki would also translate The Theatre of Orson Welles for the publisher Kodansha.) The Image of Elmo Doyle would later be selected for inclusion in The Best Short Plays of 1979.Best Short Plays, 1979, Stanley Richards, ed. Radnor, Pa., Chilton / Haynes, 1979 In 1965 France received writing grants from the Shubert and Golden foundations, then left Yale to become resident playwright at the University of Pittsburgh. He also received grants from the Ford and Rockefeller foundations.Dictionary of Literary Biography, p. 192 That year also saw the production of Envoys, a series of 106 haiku and his only verse drama, which premiered at the Yale School of Drama and would be performed as a ballet at the Venice (Italy) College of Music in 1997. Upon obtaining his doctorate from Carnegie-Mellon in 1972, France left Pittsburgh for San Francisco as a guest of the American Theatre Association. His outspokenness in moderating a playwrighting session at the ATA convention led Forum magazine to feature him in an article in its August 16, 1972 issue, titled \\"France: Criticizing the Critics.\\" His docudrama, Station J, received the support of the late Senator Daniel K. Inouye, enabling France to obtain previously withheld government documents. It was inspired by France's childhood years in Japan and his experiences in San Francisco in the early 1960s. The play, which would earn France a Silver PEN Award for Playwriting and his second NEA Creative Writing Prize, takes the evacuation and internment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War as a jumping-off point for a nuanced exploration of the nature of democracy and its often problematic on-the-ground implementation. Perhaps France's most popular play, measured by number of performances, is one of the three he wrote for children, and a marked departure from his oeuvre: The Magic Shop, which by 1980 had been performed internationally by over 150 theater groups. In 2006, his play, Obediently Yours, Orson Welles, premiered at the Théâtre Marigny in Paris, France, and has since been translated into several languages. The Spanish production, which began in Barcelone in 2008, toured for over two years, before its conclusion at the Teatro Bellas Artes in November 2010. Also in 2010, a second French-language production opened at the Atelier Théâtre Jean Vilar in Louvain-la-Neuve (where it played as Moi, Orson Welles et Don Quichotte, in a translation written by its star, Armand Delcampe). The Orson Welles role has been performed by such distinguished actors as Jean-Claude Druout (France), Armand Delcamp (Belgium), Jose Maria Pou (Spain) and Jaroslaw Gajewski (Poland). The Spanish-language text, Su seguro servidor, Orson Welles, was one of three finalists for the 2009 Premios Max Award and published by Arola Editions. In 2011 it was featured as one of three plays selected by Oberon Books (London) for its anthology Hollywood Legends: 'Live' On Stage, with an introduction by Simon Callow.Oberon Books, Ltd., 2010 In addition to its multiple translations and international stagings, Obediently Yours, Orson Welles and actor José (Josep) Maria Pou's enactment of Welles in Barcelona—where the play's Spanish translation, adapted and directed by film scholar, professor and screenwriter Esteve Riambau for Spanish- and Castilian- speaking lands as Su seguro servidor, Orson Welles, premiered at the Theatre Romea on 30 June 2008 as part of the Festival Grec—were the subject of the feature-length documentary Màscares (Masks, 2009), which premiered at the San Sebastian Film Festival. The film follows Pou as he prepares to take on the title role in Obediently Yours …. It received several Broadway options in 1997-98.

It was originally part of the Great Northern Railway (Mt Isa line), but was later downgraded to branch line status when the extension west of Hughenden opened. History Queensland is the second largest of the Australian States and Territories by area. Its vast interior was largely opened up by the construction of three east-west railway lines that connected the interior of the State to the eastern coastal towns of Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville. The trunk lines were the Main Line and Western Line from Brisbane to Roma and Charleville (completed in 1888), the Central West line from Rockhampton to Emerald and Longreach (completed in 1892), and the Great Northern Line from Townsville to Charters Towers and Hughenden (completed in 1887). But those termini were still some 500 kilometres from Queensland’s western border. It was later decided that each of the routes should each be extended to the south-west. In the case of the Western Line an extension to Cunnamulla was opened in 1898. The Central West Line was extended from Jericho south-west to Blackall and opened in 1908 whilst a further extension to Yaraka opened in 1917. Also in 1917 the Quilpie Line was opened from Westgate (south of Charleville) due west to Quilpie. The last two extensions were part of the Great Western Railway proposal. =Competing interests= A proposal to extend the Great Northern Line from Hughenden south-west to Winton was opposed by Rockhampton interests who presumably lobbied for an extension from Longreach north-west to Winton. But the south-west route prevailed and construction approval was granted in 1895.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge', Boolarong Publications, 1990 Although it was to be an extension of the Great Northern Railway it appears that the line beyond Hughenden was later renamed the Winton Branch because of extensions due west of Hughenden to Richmond were completed in 1904, to Cloncurry in 1908, to Duchess in 1912 and to Mount Isa in 1929. The Great Northern Railway then stretched nearly 1,000 kilometres. =Connection to Rockhampton= In 1928 and some thirty years after the Hughenden to Winton project, the Central West line was extended from Longreach to Winton thereby connecting two of the original trunk lines. Construction The Winton Branch was 212 kilometres in length and constructed in three stages of 62, 67 and 83 kilometres. The first stage to Stamford via Warianna siding opened on 13 December 1897.Quinlan, H. & Newland, J. 'Australian Railway Routes 1854-2000' ARHS NSW Division 2000 The next stage took the line to Corfield (previously called Manuka) on 15 October 1898. Stops were established along the way at Chinbi and Tarvano. The last stage opened to Winton on 5 July 1899 with tiny stops at Olio, Lana, Prubi, Oondooroo and Rangelands. The branch not only allowed passengers to travel between Winton and Townsville in a day (albeit a 17-hour journey) but it also facilitated a rapid expansion of the wool industry in the Winton area. A mail train ran three times a week and a goods train ran to Hughenden. Services were later reduced to one per week. =Decline= As was the case with many of Queensland’s railways, freight traffic steadily declined to the point that the Winton Branch became uneconomical to maintain. Last patronised in the mid 1990s, the branch closed in 2008. In 2012 it was reported that some 8,500 tonnes of track, 320,000 sleepers and 1.3 million dog spikes were removed and resold or recycled. The Hughenden to Winton Road that largely runs parallel to the old track has been sealed so as to provide an alternative route to the North Queensland coast when the Capricorn and Flinders Highways leading to Rockhampton and Townville are cut by floodwaters.

This was the last major military engagement fought during the war until a peace deal was reached later that year. Battle On 24 April, after several government-led offensives against rebel occupied border towns, reconnaissance missions and reports to the armed forces of the presence of several hundred heavily armed rebels regrouping in the village of Tamassi, in the vicinity of Sudan for a decisive counter-attack against government troops. Out of fear for a renewed offensive against the capital of N'Djamena, several battalions of infantry supported by dozens of armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery under the command of Brahim Mahamat Seid surrounded and closed in on Tamassi essentially allowing no alternative for escape to Sudan. The initial assault on the town itself took place around midday after artillery bombardment of the rebels defensive line broke through. The column of troops entered Tamassi from both sides. Rebels took cover in the township building and a retired army base from artillery barrage which proved to be the most resistant. Rebel technicals equipped with anti-tank and artillery lined the streets to prevent a breakthrough per defense. The first encounter took place at the township building, a large two- story compound. Close to 90 rebel fighters prevented any government assault by using RPGs and heavy weaponry. In a desperate attempt to take the building government troops broke off into groups, one coming from the rear while the other came from the back. While this was going on armored vehicles came in from the front penetrating the buildings' defense. However, a carrier was blown up killing its crew of three. The attack from the rear was repulsed, killing two soldiers from machine-gun fire. From behind troops managed to take a small percentage of an office aisle but were pushed back. Government then lines regrouped and offered an ultimatum to the rebel defenders in less than two hours or suffer consistent attacks. A truce was reached and the rebels' 62 remaining defenders were captured, while 22 were killed earlier. A civilian made medical group tended to the wounded along with the deceased one who reported seeing a soldier's legs blown off another with his eyes gouged out and mutilated.

The film revolves around the days leading up to the disappearance of Megan Stewart (Rachel Quinn), a popular high school student in North Hollywood who decided to meet a boy that she was interacting with online in person, and the subsequent investigation launched by her best friend Amy Herman (Amber Perkins). The film is presented by way of \\"found footage\\". Although filmed in 2006, the film did not find distribution until Anchor Bay Films gave it a limited theatrical release in 2011. Marketed as an educational film, upon its May 2011 release, Megan Is Missing was banned in New Zealand, and was heavily criticized by critics for its exploitative nature, poor acting, the graphic violence inflicted upon the child protagonists, and for oversexualizing the lives of young teenagers. Goi based the film on a series of real life cases of child abduction and emphasized that his reason for highlighting the violence was to unnerve people in order for the viewer to understand the modern risks that children are exposed to online. Goi wrote the script in ten days and shot the film over the course of a week. Because of the graphic content, he requested that the parents of the predominantly young cast were on set during filming so that they were fully aware of their children's involvement in the project. Plot On January 2, 2007, the film introduces Megan Stewart, a popular high school honors student who is well known and liked among her peers. However, she lives a double life — she suffers from a history of child sexual abuse and has become addicted to drugs. While talking to one of her friends via webcam, she is shown to have a dysfunctional home life due to her turbulent relationship with her mother. Amy Herman, her best friend, is an outcast who does not want to fully let go of her childhood. These two, despite their polar opposite personalities, have formed a deep bond based on their personal needs: Megan wants someone to genuinely care for her while Amy wants to be socially accepted. To celebrate Amy's upcoming 13th birthday, Megan invites her to a rave party she’s attending and starkly defends Amy when a superficial party crowd begins mocking her. That night, Amy becomes intoxicated and is physically assaulted when she refuses to have sex with one of the guys attending the party. She is mortified when she accidentally walks in on Megan performing oral sex on the party’s host. Megan later apologizes for the bad experience. While recording a video diary, she has Megan tell her life story in which she reveals she doesn’t know who her real father is and that her step father is in prison for molesting her at 9-years-old. She explains to Amy that her hostile relationship with her mother is due to her never forgiving Megan for reporting him to authorities. Amy quickly comforts her before the video ends. Megan is introduced by a friend to Josh, a man who claims to be a 17-year-old skater. He states that his little brother broke his web camera which leaves her unable to see his face. After Josh fails to reveal himself at a party that he claimed to be attending, she becomes angry at him. However, she sympathizes with him when he states that he is shy and was intimidated by her popularity. Amy begins to feel left out and Megan introduces her to him before agreeing to meet in person behind a diner. On January 7, it is revealed that she went missing and authorities begin to assume she simply ran away. Amy begins a concentrated effort to find her friend and talks with Josh online to see if he knows anything about her whereabouts. This encounter leaves Amy scared due to Josh’s threatening remarks and when she sees security footage of Megan being abducted, she reports him to the police which helps re-spark the investigation. Subsequently, disturbing photographs of Megan being mutilated and tortured while immobilized in a contraption begin to appear on an online fetish forum. Three weeks after her disappearance, Amy visits a personal hiding spot underneath an old bridge where she and Megan used to tell each other secrets and begins to record a video diary. Right before the video ends, someone is seen about to grab her. It is revealed that Amy had disappeared as well. Investigators find her video camera in a garbage can near her hiding spot. In unedited footage found on the camera, Josh unlocks a large door in a basement where he has been hiding Amy, in her underwear and chained to the wall. He makes her eat food in a dog bowl before he violently rapes her. He later returns to apologize, and says he will let her go. He then shows her a barrel and tells her to get into it so that she will not know where he lives when they leave. After Josh opens up the barrel, Amy runs away screaming as she sees Megan's rotting corpse inside. Josh grabs Amy and forces her into the barrel along with Megan's body before locking it. He loads the barrel into the car and then drives to a forest, where he digs a large hole as Amy screams and begs for her life. Josh pushes the barrel into the hole and fills it up before walking away, leaving Amy to die. During the ending credits, a clip shows Megan and Amy relaxing on a bed together, talking about their plans for the future.

Rachel Quinn and Amber Perkins were cast in the roles of the doomed Megan and Amy. The role of the villain, Josh, was given to Dean Waite, an Australian actor. Quinn had starred in several commercials, industrials, and student films prior to filming, but this film was her first professional acting experience. It marked the feature film debut of Perkins who had previously only done background work for television shows and commercials. Ban in New Zealand In October 2011, the New Zealand Censorship Board (OFLC) banned Anchor Bay's release of this film by classifying it as 'objectionable'. They claimed that it contained sexual violence and sexual conduct involving young people to such an extent and degree, and in such a manner that if it was released it would be 'injurious to the public good'. They went on to say that it relished in the spectacle of one girl's ordeal, including a three-minute rape scene. They also stated that it sexualized the lives of young teenage girls to a 'highly exploitative degree'. Reception Megan is Missing received generally negative reviews by critics. In a positive review for The Leaf-Chronicle, film critic Jamie Dexter compared the film to the Paranormal Activity franchise and The Blair Witch Project (1999) and praised the storyline, stating \\"It took days for me to shake the horrible feeling this movie left in me, but that just means it was effective in what it set out to do — show this very real and plausible scenario of how internet predators work.\\" In a negative review for the Oklahoma Gazette, Rod Lott mostly criticized the characterization and portrayal of Megan, stating: :\\"Here, the only thing writer/director Michael Goi achieves is making Megan 100 percent repugnant from the start. You don’t care about her because he goes out of his way to present her as the kind of kid who probably deserves a good punch to knock her off her pedestal. Honestly, I was so sick of hearing her speak her petty, self-absorbed yapping, I couldn't wait for her to go missing. This is amateurish trash disguised as an “important” message movie.\\" He then goes on to condemn the acting from the rest of the cast: :\\"Although fictional, “Megan Is Missing” aims to deliver the currently in-vogue cinema-verite experience, where the entire thing is assembled through supposedly found footage, from camcorders and smartphones to surveillance tapes and newscasts, not to mention one photograph that comes off as a punch line, although that’s clearly not its intent. It doesn’t help that the movie is so poorly acted, it feels like a put-on. When we see a news report on actors re-creating an abduction, the meta mistakenly leaps to self- parody. Beyond Hollywood and DVD Verdict also panned the film, with Beyond Hollywood calling it \\"majorly disappointing\\" and DVD Verdict stating that they \\"[wished] this disc had been missing from the box\\". HorrorNews.net gave a more positive review, saying that the first portion of the film \\"really works\\", although they felt that the final twenty-two minutes \\"went a little overboard\\". Criticism was directed at the acting, writing, cinematography, directing, and font choices, as well as numerous production mistakes; for example, the boom mic can be seen in several shots and director Michael Goi can be heard saying \\"Action!\\" during one scene.

He is the co-author (with Amy Sonnie) of Hillbilly Nationalists, Urban Race Rebels and Black Power: Community Organizing in Radical Times (Melville House Publishers 2012). Early life Tracy was born in Oakland, California in 1970. His family moved shortly thereafter to Vallejo, California. His father was a kindergarten teacher in the Richmond Unified School District. His mother worked a variety of jobs in the social work field. Tracy has two younger brothers. Tracy credits several formative events in shaping his early political outlook. His first job was as a paper delivery person for the Vallejo Independent Press, a worker-owned newspaper founded by striking newspaper workers. This introduced the idea of worker self-management to him. In early 1989, the presence of Neo-Nazi organizers in Vallejo helped him form an anti-racist commitment. Tracy attended anti-nuclear and environmental demonstrations as early as 1987. Housing organizing In 1992, Tracy co-founded the Eviction Defense Network (EDN) an organization which utilized direct action to prevent evictions. The EDN was invited to work alongside public housing residents organizing for the right-of-return in the federal HOPE VI program. Subsequently, he was a member of the Coalition On Homelessness, Mission Agenda, and the Mission Anti- Displacement Coalition.

Its first project in the latter regard was sponsoring a 1974 revue of Indian classical music – the Music Festival from India – led by Ravi Shankar and featuring world music pioneers such as Shivkumar Sharma, Hariprasad Chaurasia, L. Subramaniam and Sultan Khan. A year after Harrison's death, proceeds from the 2002 Concert for George, along with accompanying album and film releases, went to the foundation for dispersal to appropriate charities. The Material World Charitable Foundation continues to operate under the objectives outlined by Harrison in 1974, funded by income from his donated copyrights. Establishment George Harrison founded the Material World Charitable Foundation, or MWF, on 26 April 1973,Badman, p. 98. close to two years after he had organised the Concert for Bangladesh in New York as a benefit for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War.Madinger & Easter, pp. 435, 438. As effective as this relief effort had been in raising awareness in the Western world and helping to stop the war between what was then West and East Pakistan,Tillery, pp. 99–100. the revenue it generated for the refugees had been denied tax-exempt status in America and the UK.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 43.Clayson, pp. 315–16. In addition, up to $10 million of the funds remained in escrow,Woffinden, p. 52. subject to an IRS audit.The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, p. 419. Speaking to British DJ Nicky Horne, Harrison recognised that the existence of a foundation or trust in 1971 would have ensured that all the revenue had reached UNICEF immediately, but that \\"there was no real planning [for the Concert for Bangladesh] … it was an emergency.\\" Harrison named the foundation after the title track to his 1973 album, Living in the Material World, a composition in which he contrasts the temptations of the material world with the pursuit of spiritual goals.Inglis, pp. 40–41.Tillery, pp. 111–12. To fund the MWF, Harrison donated his copyright for nine of the eleven songs on the album, ensuring a perpetual stream of income through his publishing royalties.Schaffner, p. 160.Clayson, pp. 322–23. The album enjoyed considerable commercial success,Madinger & Easter, p. 439. topping America's Billboard chart for five weeks,Spizer, p. 253. and produced one of Harrison's most popular hit songs, \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\\".Lavezzoli, p. 194. Harrison similarly assigned to the MWF his copyright to \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\",George Harrison, p. 386. a track he recorded with Ringo Starr for the latter's Ringo album, another bestseller over 1973–74.Spizer, pp. 305, 307. For the foundation's logo, Harrison used an adaptation of the traditional Om symbol in Devanagari, as it appeared on the artwork for Material World and his subsequent album, Dark Horse (1974).Spizer, pp. 256, 258, 265–66. According to the stated mission of the Material World Charitable Foundation, its purpose is twofold: to serve as a charitable organisation making donations to various causes, and to sponsor and encourage artistic endeavours and \\"alternative life views and philosophies\\".Collaborations, p. 32.\\"Material World Charitable Foundation\\" > About, georgeharrison.com (retrieved 29 October 2013). During the same conversation with Horne, in August 1974, Harrison explained that, as with his recently launched Dark Horse record label,Madinger & Easter, p. 442. his inspiration for the foundation was similar to what the Beatles had intended for their Apple organisation in 1968: \\"a foundation in which we could help [people]\\". The establishment of the Material World Charitable Foundation ensured that all the money he personally made through music and wished to donate could find its way to the cause of his choice,Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", CIrcus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 22 October 2013). whereas otherwise, to donate £10 he had to earn at least ten times that amount.\\"At the Starting Gate\\", Contra Band Music, 21 August 2012 (retrieved 22 October 2013). Activities Harrison credited his friendship with Indian musician Ravi Shankar as being instrumental in his aims for the MWF, since Shankar had led him to a greater appreciation of other cultures and their music. The foundation's first venture was to sponsor Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India,Olivia Harrison, p. 302. the debut performance of which took place at London's Royal Albert Hall on 23 September 1974.Badman, p. 133. Harrison had first envisioned such a festival of Indian classical music in 1967–68, as a means of presenting India's musical and cultural heritage to a Western audience.Collaborations, p. 15. The Music Festival brought together established pioneers of the genre, such as Shivkumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia,Lavezzoli, pp. 32–33, 117, 195. and future international stars including L. Subramaniam and Sultan Khan.World Music: The Rough Guide, pp. 77, 79, 82, 85.Dan Forte, \\"Ravi Shankar and George Harrison Collaborations\\", Vintage Guitar, February 2011 (retrieved 13 August 2014).Leng, pp. 148, 168.

Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes of the achievement in staging the Music Festival: \\"In effect, this was the first Indian orchestra to appear in Europe.\\"Leng, p. 148. Three of the concerts on Harrison and Shankar's joint North American tour at the end of that year were benefits for the Material World Charitable Foundation.David Fricke, \\"George Harrison Show Revisited on DVD\\", rollingstone.com, 25 October 2005 (retrieved 4 September 2014). After Harrison's death in November 2001, his hit song \\"My Sweet Lord\\" was reissued as a charity single,William Ruhlmann, \\"George Harrison 'My Sweet Lord (2002)'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 30 October 2013).\\"My Sweet Lord\\", Graham Calkin's Beatles Pages, 2002 (retrieved 30 October 2013). the proceeds from which the MWF distributed to organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, Great Ormond Street Hospital and Britain's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The foundation then sponsored the 2002 Concert for George tribute, and the funds raised through associated film and album releases in 2003 similarly went to the MWF for distribution to charitable causes.George Harrison: Living in the Material World, hbo.com (retrieved 25 September 2013).Film credits (reproduced on slipcase), Concert for George DVD (Warner Strategic Marketing, 2003; directed by David Leland; produced by Ray Cooper, Olivia Harrison & Jon Kamen). In his 2009 book You Never Give Me Your Money, author Peter Doggett wrote that the Material World Charitable Foundation \\"continues to fund worthy causes to this day\\".Doggett, p. 207. Another humanitarian initiative resulting from the Concert for Bangladesh, the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF, remains active with international projects to help provide emergency relief for children in the Horn of Africa in 2011\\"UNICEF's Month of Giving raises more than USD $1 million\\" , concertforbangladesh.com, 19 December 2011 (retrieved 31 October 2013). and fundraising challenges through the Association of College Unions International.\\"The George Harrison Fund for UNICEF: 'Help Us Save Some Lives' Campus Challenge\\", UNICEF, 13 October 2011 (retrieved 30 October 2013).

The Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays began play in the 1977 Major League Baseball season, becoming the 25th and 26th teams in Major League Baseball. Seattle and Toronto were included in a list of potential expansion cities in a survey conducted by the American League in 1960. The others were Atlanta, Buffalo, Dallas–Fort Worth, Denver, Oakland, and San Diego (all of which received franchises eventually through expansion or relocation except Buffalo). Seattle In the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion, Kansas City, Montreal, San Diego, and Seattle were each granted a franchise; the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots were added to the American League, while the Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres joined the National League. The Seattle Pilots only played one season, during which they faced financial difficulties owing to no television coverage, a poorly performing team, a stadium with problems, and the highest ticket and concession prices in the league. Owners of other American League teams wanted Dewey Soriano and William R. Daley to sell the team to a Seattle owner who would improve the team and address issues at Sick's Stadium, particularly uncovered seats with bad views. After several attempts to sell the team to a Seattle owner failed, on April 1, 1970 judge Sidney Volinn declared the team officially bankrupt; it was sold to Bud Selig, who moved the team to Milwaukee and renamed it the Milwaukee Brewers. Selig had negotiated a deal for the purchase with Soriano during Game 1 of the 1969 World Series. As a result of the relocation of the Seattle Pilots to Milwaukee, in 1970 the city of Seattle, King County and the state of Washington sued the American League for breach of contract. The 32.5 million dollar lawsuit proceeded until 1976, when at trial the American League offered the city a franchise in exchange for the city, county, and state to drop the suit. On November 2, 1972, King County had broken ground on the Kingdome, which would come to be used by the Seattle Mariners for baseball and by the Seahawks for football. On January 15, 1976, the expansion franchise was approved, becoming the 13th franchise in the American League. It was owned by Lester Smith and Danny Kaye, who paid an expansion fee of million. Owing to the history surrounding the franchise, sportswriter Emmett Watson of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer joked that the team should be named the Seattle Litigants. Toronto Toronto had a long history of interest in baseball. Its first professional baseball team was established in 1885, and in 1886 Sunlight Park was built to host its games. In 1897, Hanlan's Point Stadium was built at the Toronto Islands for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, and on September 5, 1914 it was the site of baseball legend Babe Ruth's first professional home run and only minor league home run. In 1926, Maple Leaf Stadium was built for the Toronto Maple Leafs. The team was successful, sometimes drawing more fans than established Major League Baseball teams. The team was owned by Jack Kent Cooke, who in the mid-1950s sought municipal financing of a major league baseball park on the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition. He was also involved in the failed attempt to establish the Continental League as a third league in Major League Baseball. Maple Leaf Stadium was demolished in 1968 after the Toronto Maple Leafs were sold to Walter Dilbeck and moved to Louisville, Kentucky. (The team moved again, and is now the Pawtucket Red Sox.) In the early 1970s, Toronto City Council alderman Paul Godfrey proposed a plan for a publicly financed domed stadium in the city, but it was opposed by taxpayers and amateur sports groups. Undeterred, he proposed renovation of Exhibition Stadium to support baseball. The stadium was renovated in anticipation of the city being awarded a Major League Baseball team, costing . Half of the funds were provided by the municipal government, and the other half from an interest-free loan from the Government of Ontario. Its seating capacity was increased to 40,000. There had been strong interest from several groups and individuals to own a Major League Baseball team in the city. The most prominent was Labatt Brewing Company, who wanted to use ownership of a sports team as a means to establish a visible presence in the Toronto market. On January 9, 1976, the National Exhibition Company, owners of the San Francisco Giants, established an agreement in principle to sell the franchise to a consortium owned by Labatt Brewing Company, Vulcan Assets, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce for . The Giants had failed to repay a loan from Major League Baseball, and had experienced declining revenues since the relocation of the Kansas City Athletics to Oakland in 1968. Of the sale price, was to be placed in escrow to \\"meet certain possible obligations with respect to the transaction\\", especially the lease of Candlestick Park, which would expire in 1994. The new owners of the Giants, led by Don McDougall, would move the team to Toronto pending approval from the other eleven National League teams, which would be sought on January 14 at the Winter Meetings of General Managers in Phoenix. The team would be known as the Toronto Giants and would begin play during the 1976 Major League Baseball season. The deal was scuttled by a Superior Court of California, which issued an injunction blocking the sale on February 11, 1976; the injunction was requested by the city of San Francisco on January 10. The National Exhibition Company eventually accepted a purchase proposal from Bob Lurie in a deal brokered by George Moscone, the Mayor of San Francisco. The American League provided an opportunity for a Toronto franchise, and two groups bid for the rights to franchise ownership in the city. Ultimately, an ownership group named Metro Baseball Ltd. consisting of Labatt Brewing Company, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and Imperial Trust won the bid for a franchise fee of . The other bid was made by Atlantic Packaging. The winning bid was represented by legal counsel Herb Solway and Gord Kirke. Kirke prepared the original documents which led to the foundation of the team in 1976. After the city was awarded the franchise, U.S. President Gerald Ford attempted to pressure Major League Baseball to instead award the franchise to Washington, D.C., which he claimed should have a team before Toronto. Both the American League and National League dismissed his request. In preparation for the 1977 season, Toronto City Council approved a further for renovation to Exhibition Stadium. Paul Beeston was hired as the team's first employee, and Peter Bavasi was hired as the team's first president and general manager. Expansion draft In order to stock the roster of each team, a draft was held on November 5, 1976 in which each of the extant teams would make available to the expansion franchises some of the players on their major league and minor league rosters. Each team was allowed to protect fifteen players on the major league roster, and an additional three players after each of the first and second round of the draft. The Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays each selected 30 players in the draft.

In February 2013, redevelopment began on the vacant mall property. History Montgomery Mall opened in 1970 with Montgomery Fair and JCPenney as its anchor stores. Other major tenants at the time included Lerner New York, Morrison's Cafeteria, Singer Sewing Center, and Elmore Variety Store. The Montgomery Fair store was later rebranded Gayfers. An expansion, begun in 1987 and completed in 1988, added a new wing anchored by Parisian. In 1998, Glimcher Realty Trust bought the mall for $70 million. By the early 2000s, several stores had begun to close in the mall, including Piccadilly Cafeteria, Gap, Eddie Bauer, Ruby Tuesday, and American Eagle Outfitters.

She is very uncomfortable doing any of the things Akagi tells her to do, such as making poses or calling each other by their colors and not their actual names. However, by the middle of the series, she gains enough confidence to make her own roll call, referencing veteran action director Kazuo Niibori as her inspiration. An unusual feature of Akiba Blue's suit is a picture of a teddy bear printed on the lower backside of her uniform's panties. In Season Tsuu, it is revealed that the events of the later episodes of the first season were somehow retconned, with Mitsuki being scouted to work by the Pentagon instead of Akagi and she is now the one who has left to the United States after the Akibarangers defeated the Stema Otsu for good.

Though her new family upbringing initially restricts her otaku tendencies, she secretly keeps her manga collection behind the bookshelf in her bedroom. As a means to defeat the Smaphone Monger in episode 4, Yuko draws a Z-Cune Aoi dōjinshi that inspires Akagi to materialize the MMZ-02 Munyu Munyu Zubaaan and become Super Akiba Red. Her alias' surname includes the kanji for , while the kanji read as in her married name is constructed with the kanji for \\"yellow\\".

However, Hiroyo was unaware that the MMZ-01s were intended by Doctor Z to destroy the barrier between reality and fantasy while also inflicting her with a curse upon being the first person to hold them. With the curse taking the form of a scorpion tattoo on her chest, it slowly crawls up her throat whenever the MMZ-01 units are used in the real world before it takes away her voice forever. The curse is later revealed to be the work of Saburo Hatte as part of an in-show retooling before it was dropped once Akagi confirmed that it was a plot device.

The Void Captain's Tale takes place three or four thousand years in the future in an era called the Second Starfaring Age, a setting Spinrad revisited in the 1985 novel Child of Fortune. The book contains elements of confession, love story, eroticism, and horror. Plot Like Child of Fortune, The Void Captain's Tale is written in a unique mix of English words, foreign words, and invented words—the first-person perspective of a possibly-unreliable narrator, the voidship captain Genro Kane Gupta. Genro's starship is part transport, part pleasure vessel. While the majority of passengers are kept in suspended animation, a wealthy few, the Floating Cultura, spend the voyage in the pursuit of pleasure—it is Genro's job to entertain these passengers. Unlike the technological focus of many science fiction novels, Genro claims the exact nature of space travel is not understood; the ship's interstellar drive is powered by the psychic energy of a young woman pilot. Theodore Sturgeon explained the \\"erotic form of space travel\\" in the Los Angeles Times Book Review: \\"Spinrad's ingenious space-drive has the ship's machine create a field . . . which at peak and at captain's command melds with the pilot's psyche, causing the ship to cease to exist in one spatial locus and reappear in another.\\" Contemporary Authors,Vol. 233. Detroit: Gale, 2005. p358-408, Norman Spinrad, Page 362 During transit, the pilot experiences orgasm. Typically pilots are not part of the social life of the ship, and the occupation takes a physical toll. Spinrad outlines the entire plot of the book in the first few pages. The remainder of the novel simply goes into more detail. Most of the book deals with Genro's obsession with his pilot, Dominique Alia Wu. Pilots experience a quasi-religious ecstasy during jump, and Dominique believes she can permanently merge with the Great and Only with the captain's help. Eventually, when Genro cannot resist the temptation, he has sexual intercourse with the pilot, setting off a chain reaction of events which result in the captain losing both his sexual prowess and his status as leader of the floating cultura. His growing disassociation from society and his allegiance to the succubus-like hold of the pilot's psychic siren call lead to his eventual submission to Dominique's will, and he jumps the ship without first laying in any coordinates- freeing Dominique from both the physical world and her sexual servitude to the jump circuit, but trapping his ship and its passengers in the void between the stars. Reception According to some sources, The Void Captain's Tale, and Child of Fortune received \\"considerable attention\\". Many of Spinrad's books have provoked controversy, and The Void Captain's Tale, with numerous sexually- explicit passages, was no exception. The novel received positive reviews in the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times, although the New York Times reviewer noted readers would need to meet the author halfway. A Library Journal review made a similar point but came to a different conclusion, noting \\"one may be able to wring a highly rewarding experience from this dense and difficult novel,\\" but calling Spinrad's use of language \\"laborious reading\\". Dave Langford reviewed The Void Captain's Tale for White Dwarf #64, and stated that \\"the story succeeds. It's over-long, it bogs down in portentousness, but the chase of the metaphysical white whale still compels. Worth a look, though younger readers may need to protect impressionable parents from the many sex scenes.\\" The Void Captain's Tale was nominated for the 1983 Nebula Award for best novel and the 1984 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

Al- Battat pledged his loyalty to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Al-Battat was arrested briefly on 2 January 2014 but was released despite still being a fugitive. He was apparently \\"accidentally assassinated\\" at point-blank range on 20 December 2014 at a fake police checkpoint in eastern Iraq by an unknown party.  Formation  On 4 February 2013, al- Battat announced the formation of the Mukhtar Army with the stated purpose of protecting Iraq's Shi'as, and to assist the government in combating terrorism. He stated that the Mukhtar Army would prevent any Sunnis controlled by al- Qaeda or other militant sectarian groups from attempting to topple the Shi'a-led government in Iraq. In a phone interview with the Associated Press, Al-Battat said that the group receives weapons and other support from Iran, and is advised by the Quds Force, a special unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that oversees its external operations. He describes himself as a follower of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran. An IRGC official dismissed suggestions it supports any armed group in Iraq, saying that such \\"claims are aimed at defaming the Guard. We do not see any reason to respond to such baseless claims.\\" A spokesperson for the Hezbollah Brigades also distanced his group from al-Battat and the Mukhtar Army, stating that al- Battat \\"is not affiliated with the Hezbollah Brigades in any way whatsoever.\\" Ahmed Abu Risha, the head of the Sunni Anbar Salvation Council, argues that the Mukhtar Army was created with Iraqi government consent to silence Sunni- led protests that began in December 2012. A few days after the group's formation, the Iraqi government issued an arrest warrant against al-Battat. Speaking on 9 February 2013, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki called on Iraqi citizens to cooperate with security forces in disclosing the whereabouts of al-Battat in order to arrest him as soon as possible.  Activities  Al- Battat stated that the Mukhtar Army was behind the rocket and mortar attack on 9 February 2013 that killed seven members of the Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e Khalq (MEK) housed at Camp Liberty in Baghdad. He threatened more attacks against the MEK until they leave the country. In mid-February, threatening flyers signed by the Mukhtar Army were placed at Sunni households in Baghdad's Jihad neighborhood. The leaflets warned \\"enemy\\" Sunnis to leave now or face \\"great agony\\". The Mukhtar Army denied responsibility for the flyers. The Mukhtar Army has also threatened that it will \\"liberate\\" Saudi Arabia and target the Mubarak Al Kabeer Port being constructed in Kuwait. On 21 November 2013, the Mukhtar Army claimed responsibility for six mortar bombs fired into northern Saudi Arabia that landed near a border post. Al-Battat said, \\"The goal was to send a warning message to the Saudis to tell them that their border stations and patrol are within our range of fire.\\" He also said he wanted Saudi Arabia to stop \\"interfering\\" with Iraqi affairs.  Statements  In an interview aired on 5 February 2013 on the Iraqi Al Sharqiya television channel, al-Battat stated, \\"Allah willing, we shall annihilate the infidel, atheist Saudi regime, and all the regimes that wage war against Islam, incite their peoples to wage war against Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, and support Israel and America. In an interview aired on 23 October 2013 on the Iraqi Al Sumaria television channel, al-Battat stated, \\"When it comes to politics, our authority is the leader, Ali Khamenei... I am proud to be a foot soldier in the army of the leader, Sayyed Khamenei.\\" He added, \\"What is important is the common enemies – the Americans and the Israelis. We must confront them with all our force. After we annihilate the Jews, we can deal with domestic matters.

He played the lead role in the award- winning 26-part 1976 television series Power Without Glory.  Career  Vaughan was born in Brisbane, Queensland to a vaudeville comedian father in 1931. Moving to Sydney, New South Wales at age 17, he was employed in a number of occupations including steam presser, tram conductor, postman customs clerk and a bassoon player. After taking theatre production classes, he landed his first stage role in 1963 when he was aged 32, and has never been out of work.North Shore Times, 24 July 2011. He moved into television in 1967. In 1975 he won the Hoyts Prize for Best Performance by an Actor at the AFI Awards, for his role of Australian Prime Minister Billy HughesABC Television, Billy Hughes's Family Secret in Billy and Percy. This was a tied result with Jack Thompson's role in Sunday Too Far Away.IMdB: Martin Vaughan. His continuing interest in Billy Hughes led some years later to the revelation that Hughes's daughter Helen had died in childbirth in London; in 2004 he presented an ABC program on the story. His big break came in 1976, when he was chosen to play the lead role of John West in the ABC's 26-part television adaptation of Frank Hardy's novel Power Without Glory. In 1977 he won the Logie Award for Most Popular Actor for this role. He has since appeared in such television programs as The Dismissal (1983 miniseries; as Senator Albert Field), Come In Spinner (1989–90 miniseries), Water Rats, Blue Heelers, All Saints, The Flying Doctors, Salem's Lot (2004 miniseries), and headLand. His feature films include Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), Letters from Poland (1978), We of the Never Never (1982), Phar Lap (1983), The Man Who Sued God (2001) and Australian Rules. He has also appeared in over 60 stage plays.Martin Vaughan  Later years  Vaughan completed a Bachelor of Arts in Theatre and Film at the age of 63 at the University of New South Wales.

Function and medical relevance Like most AGC kinases, the NDR kinase subclass is activated by phosphorylation of a conserved serine or threonine in an activation region C-terminal to the kinase catalytic domain. The NDR kinases are distinguished by an apparently functionally essential binding of MOB co-activator proteins that are also widely present in eukaryotes. Most NDR kinase catalytic domains also contain an extended insert region that may function as an auto-inhibitory element. The NDR kinase family can be further divided into two subgroups, the Ndr family and the Wts/Lats family. Humans have four NDR kinases: Ndr1 (or STK38), Ndr2 (or STK38L), Lats1 (large tumor suppressor-1) and Lats2. In animals these kinases have reported roles in the regulation of diverse processes, including cell proliferation control, activity of proto-oncogenic proteins, apoptosis, centrosome duplication, and organization of neuronal dendrites. In unicellular eukaryotes, Ndr kinases play important roles in the control of the cell cycle and morphogenesis. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an organism amenable for the study of cell morphogenesis, the Ndr kinase Orb6 has a role in cell polarity and morphogenesis control in part by the regulation of small Rho-type GTPase Cdc42. Specifically, Orb6 kinase spatially restricts Cdc42 activation to be at the polarized tips of a cell, causing the Cdc42-dependent formins, For3 (an F-actin cable polymerization factor), to also be activated at the cell tips, ensuring proper cell growth and polarization. Upon loss of Orb6 kinase function, cells fail to maintain a polarized cell shape and become round.

In the vertebrate, these retinal cells differentiate into seven cell types, including retinal ganglion cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, and Müller glia cells. During embryogenesis, retinal cells originate from the anterior portion of the neural plate termed the eye field. Eye field cells with a retinal fate express several transcription factor markers including Rx1, Pax6, and Lhx2. The eye field gives rise to the optic vesicle and then to the optic cup. The retina is generated from the precursor cells within the inner layer of the optic cup, as opposed to the retinal pigment epithelium that originate from the outer layer of the optic cup. In general, the developing retina is organized so that the least-committed precursor cells are located in the periphery of the retina, while the committed cells are located in the center of the retina. The differentiation of retinal precursor cells into the mature cell types found in the retina is coordinated in time and space by factors within the cell as well as factors in the environment of the cell. One example of an intrinsic regulator of this process is the transcription factor Ath5. Ath5 expression in retinal progenitor cells biases their differentiation into a retinal ganglion cell fate. An example of an environmental factor is the morphogen sonic hedge hog (Shh). Shh has been shown to repress the differentiation of precursor cells into retinal ganglion cells. Wnt- signaling cascade in retinal development and retinal precursor cells The Wnt signaling pathway is a crucial component of proper retinal development. Briefly, Wnt signaling proteins bind to their receptors, the Frizzled receptor family, and cause activation of molecular cascades within the cell. Fz3 is a Wnt receptor that is eventually restricted to the eye field of the neural plate during development. Overexpression of this receptor causes the formation of ectopic eyes during development, while dominant-negative inhibition of this protein causes improper eye development. Fz4 and Fz5 are found in the distal area of the optic vesicle. This distal region is what that gives rise to the retina. During cell fate determination of the retina, Wnt and Fz expression gradients form in a peripheral to central manner. At this time, Fz4 expression is localized in the periphery and is suggested to play a role in precursor cell maintenance. In contrast to Fz4, Wnt11 is localized in the center of the developing retina and is suggested to play a role in precursor cell differentiation. This expression coincides with the fact that committed cells are located in the center of the developing retina while undifferentiated cells are concentrated in the periphery Fz5 expression is implicated in differentiation of retinal precursor cells to a neural fate.

History=Proposal= In 1889, the Lake Manitoba Railway and Canal Company (LMR) received a federal charter to build a railway branch line from Portage La Prairie north to the southern boundary of Lake Manitoba, to link with existing lake and river steamers, and to build navigable canals to connect Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis and the North Saskatchewan River. Since railways were better suited than watercraft in meeting the overall transportation needs within the province, the charter's scope changed within a year to a line from Portage La Prairie to Lake Winnipegosis, at or near Meadow Portage. The standard 6,400 acre-per-mile land grant for railway construction applied. The line was usually called the Dauphin railway, or sometimes the Lake Dauphin railway,Portage la Prairie Weekly: 10 May 1893, & 10 & 17 Sep 1896; The Winnipeg Daily Tribune: 12 Apr 1894, 8 Jun 1894, 13 Mar 1896 & 20 Oct 1897; Daily Nor'Wester: 8, 12 & 14 Jun 1894, 25 Feb 1896, 25 Jun 1896, 28 Jul 1896 & 31 Aug 1896 to indicate an overall route west of Lake Manitoba. In 1892 the LMR charter was revived to build from Gladstone or Arden to Dauphin. With no progress, the charter owned by Charles Herbert Mackintosh and M.P. Davie lapsed, and new owner, Major Walsh, was unable to argue its renewal.The Winnipeg Daily Tribune: 12 Apr 1894, 18 May 1894 & 29 Jul 1899; Portage la Prairie Weekly, 24 may 1894; Daily Nor'Wester: 12 & 14 Jun 1894, & 6 Aug 1894 Despite government urging, railway companies laid no new track on the Prairies during 1893–1895 owing to low returns on the capital investment. In 1895, Clifford Sifton, a provincial cabinet member, spearheaded a new initiative for Manitoba to guarantee railway company bonds issued for new construction within the province, but the existing railways were lukewarm to the concept. However, he discovered Donald Mann, a railway construction contractor, who seeking work, expressed merit in the plan. Mann purchased the LMR charter for $38,000, but to facilitate bank and government financing, he was obliged to take on a strong partner. Joined by William Mackenzie with whom he had worked on Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) construction, this was their first major collaboration.

Although longer than a direct route, it offered better traffic prospects. They negotiated a federal subsidy of $8,000 per mile, the land grant, and the former HBR $40,000 a year federal transportation contract if the line reached halfway from Winnipeg to the Saskatchewan River. The Manitoba legislature guaranteed principal and interest on LMR bonds at either 4% or 5% for 30 years for up to $8,000 per mile (about $800,000), and exempted earnings on the line from taxes for the same 30 years. The provincial guarantee, supplementing adequate federal aid for a line that cost only $7,000 a mile to build, prompted ongoing controversy.The Winnipeg Daily Tribune: 13 Mar 1896 & 29 Jul 1899; People's Voice, 27 Mar 1897; Morning Telegram, 28 Mar 1899 Train station, Winnipegosis, 1897 Wet weather delayed the spring 1896 surveys and early grading.Daily Nor'Wester: 16 & 30 Apr 1896, & 25 Jun 1896; Portage la Prairie Weekly, 25 Jun 1896; The Winnipeg Daily Tribune: 17 Jul 1896 & 22 Sep 1896 Track laying, which commenced in August,Portage la Prairie Weekly, 20 Aug 1896 averaged a day.

In 1901, CNoR built Gladstone-Beaver, and Northern Pacific and Manitoba (NP&M;), Portage La Prairie-Beaver, which it sold to CNoR that year.

During the early years, Winnipegosis passenger and freight traffic flourished. Although the Waterhen River indirectly links to Lake Manitoba, the absence of a suitable connecting channel had previously limited development. The Winnipegosis rail link led to booming industries for fishing on Lake Winnipegosis, and lumber extraction along its shores. Fish and cordwood were key freight items.Daily Nor'Wester, 14 Dec 1897; The Winnipeg Evening Tribune, 30 Jul 1917 Steamboats, which carried freight and some passenger traffic, operated until the 1920s. The concept of a Meadow Portage canal resurfaced in 1912, but was not pursued.Portage la Prairie Weekly: 16 Oct 1912 & 10 & 20 Nov 1912. To resolve CNoR's dire financial predicament, the federal government effectively took control of the company in 1917, and it later merged into Canadian National Railway (CNR). National Grain elevator, Winnipegosis, 2015 (Photographer Steve Boyko) =Closure= The Winnipegosis train station, built to CNoR plan 100-63 in 1897, has become a museum. As early as 1964, diminished passenger and freight traffic called for the abandonment of the line. In 1975, the CN agent-operator position was eliminated at Winnipegosis. For that entire year, the line carried a total of 15 passengers. In early 1977, the Railway Transport Committee of the Canadian Transport Commission issued its order Number R-24506 authorizing CN to end 80 years of Dauphin-Winnipegosis passenger travel. The final mixed train left Dauphin for Winnipegosis on April 19, returning that afternoon. With only a weekly freight train to the Winnipegosis grain elevator, the Fork River-Winnipegosis section was ordered abandoned, effective March 14, 1983. Contractors removed the track in summer 1985. The Cowan subdivision included North of Dauphin (Mile 0), Sifton (Mile 13.2), Sifton Junction (Mile 15.0), Garland (Mile 38.7), and Minitonas (Mile 87.3). A torrential downpour in July 1993 washed out the line between Garland and Minitonas, but the damage was never repaired. In 1996, CN announced plans to discontinue or sell its Cowan and the remainder of Winnipegosis subdivisions. The former was abandoned in 2000, and the latter in 1997. These rails have since been lifted.

Etching by C. Murer after himself, c. 1600-1614. Verbi Dei minister (Minister of the Word of God), also verbi divini minister (Minister of the Divine Word), is a Latin religious title abbreviated V.D.M.. The term was typically appended as a post-nominal honorific style to a person's full name to denote his status as a Christian minister. The title was mostly used by Protestant ministers. It was very common in usage in the 18th and early 19th century but seems to have fallen out of use as the pre-nominal honorific style \\"Reverend\\" grew more common. Yet, there are also examples where both are used such as the letter from Samuel Davies to Mr. Bellamy on the state of religion among the Protestant dissenters of Virginia where Davies' name is styled, \\"Reverend Mr. Samuel Davies, V.D.M.\\" The Ledger stone for Olof Parlin in the Gloria Dei Church of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania provides one example of the use of this title in reference to the date that he was ordained. It says, \\"Stop, traveller, who art thyself mortal, and drop a tear upon this receptacle of corruption. Here lies quietly and in peace, after a happy death, a man conspicuous in erudition, taught of God, the most reverend, most learned OLOF PARLIN, Provost of the Swedish-Lutheran churches which are collected by God in North America, and placed as most worthy pastor over that in Wicacoa.

A third example of its usage is found in a letter from the Consistory of the Dutch Reformed Church in Raritan, New Jersey to General George Washington in 1779. The letter closes, \\"by order of the Consistory, Jacob R Hardenburgh, V.D.M.\\" A fourth example of its usage and explanation of meaning is found in a biographical sketch for a man named Robert Hamilton of Adams County, Ohio.

He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Willingboro, New Jersey. He is on the faculty of the University of the Arts, Temple University and University of Southern Mississippi. He also performs in jazz clubs, concert halls and festivals around the world. He has played jazz standards, jazz interpretations of classical music (a repertoire that includes Villa Lobos, Mozart, and Bach) Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and other rock musicians from the 1960s. Miceli has worked with David Friedman, Joe Magnarelli, Dave Liebman, Elio Villafranca, Steve Slagle, Dave Stryker, Peter Bernstein, Gerald Veasley, and Joanna Pascale. After graduating with a Bachelors in Performance from the University of the Arts in 1982, he began a career that included composing, recording, teaching, and performing. Some of the venues and festivals he has played include Degu Jazz Festival (Korea), The Reading Jazz Festival, the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, The Jazz Standard, The Zinc Bar, 55 Bar, The Wexford Art Center (Ireland), and The Mallet Institute (Düsseldorf Germany). He is the creator and moderator of the Vibraphone Community Website. Early life and career Miceli was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1960 and grew up in Willingboro, New Jersey. He began to play classical guitar in his youth before later turning to piano, trumpet and drums. It was in college that he and the vibraphone cemented an unbreakable bond of mutual give and take. Philadelphia now claims him as its own as he settled there in 1978 while attending the University of the Arts, where he is now an adjunct associate professor. He also teaches at Temple's Boyer College of Music and was a guest lecturer at the Curtis Institute of Music. Miceli connects with a growing group of musicians living in the Germantown neighborhood who are revitalizing its jazz scene with local performances, jams and a new recording studio. 80s and early 90s In the 1980s and early 90s, Miceli toured extensively through Germany with the percussion group “Mallet Madness”. Featuring Miceli on vibraphone with Ron Von Strattun (drums), Bernd Zinzius (Bass) and Christoph Eidens (vibes and marimba), Mallet Madness played jazz versions of rock songs, in a trio reminiscent of the guitar trios of the 60's, with vibraphone replacing guitar as the feature instrument. The group played clubs and festivals throughout Continental Europe including: Schlag. Wekstatt, Jazz Fruhling, Deutsches Percussion – Symposium, Stadtgarten Restaurant, Rundfunk, K14, Blue Stage, Mulheimer Jazz Club, and the Essen Jazz Festival. In 1995, and back in Philadelphia, Miceli started \\"The Rock Band\\" with bassist Kevin MacConnell and Drummer Harry \\"Butch\\" Reed. A result of Miceli's early Rock Music influences, the group covered several British Invasion bands including The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Kinks, and Jimi Hendrix.Anderson, Bruce.

Career 2018 saw Miceli issue his latest CD, Invitation, an album of solos that expresses warmth and clarity. Standards like Jimmy Van Heusen's “But Beautiful” sound so effortless they float. Gloria Krolak, host of Good Vibes, the only radio program dedicated to the vibraphone, noted recently “Miceli’s compass points to tunes with no end of nuance and subtlety. He gives the phrase ‘soft touch’ a whole new meaning.” As the originator of The Jōst Project, with vocalist Paul Jōst, Miceli racked up two more wins with albums that plug into new generations for jazz by playing the classic rock they grew up with. The first, Peace and Love, was released in 2017, then Can’t Find My Way Home in 2013. Miceli also appears on Jōst’s 2014 Breaking Through. A champion of rock-inspired repertory, Miceli moves easily from one genre to another. Also in 2014, violinist Diane Monroe and Miceli collaborated on a duo album, Alone Together. Wrote Victor Schermer on the All About Jazz website, “Monroe and Miceli are adept and resilient musicians of the highest caliber, so they are able to weave their combined sounds into many expressive variations that create ‘tone poems’ and tell stories.” In 2009 Miceli's group Monkadelphia released Crepuscle, a follow-up to Monkadelphia, both devoted to the revolutionary jazz pianist himself, performing his music in an innovative, contemporary way. Miceli has performed at jazz festivals and clubs too numerous to list. A partial roll call starts at Hilton Head Island's Jazz Vibes Showcase in 2019 with Team Omega, then to the Daegu Festival in Daegu, Korea; the International Percussion Festival in Lima, Peru; the Limerick Jazz Festival in Ireland; and the Montreal Jazz Festival. Closer to home he has played at the Jazz Bridge Concert Series, Peace Day Kickoff, the Rhythm Festival, Please Touch Museum Jazz Festival, all in Philadelphia, as well as those in Media, Reading and Dauphin County, PA, and the Longwood Gardens Festivals. The Exit Zero Jazz Festival in Cape May, NJ and the Somers Point Jazz Festival in Somers Point, NJ; the Rehoboth Beach Festival in Delaware, and the Vail Colorado Jazz Festival have all hosted Miceli. Miceli plays with the highest caliber musicians. As a group leader, sideman, and recording artist, he has performed with numerous top musicians including David Liebman, Jimmy Bruno, Ken Peplowski, John Blake, Diane Monroe, John Swana, Joe Magnarelli, Steve Slagle, Larry McKenna, Gerald Veasley and many others. Chris's Jazz Café, Philadelphia's premier jazz club, is a frequent gig for Miceli and friends, and he performs annually at the Percussive Arts Society convention in Indianapolis. Internationally known on the web, Miceli provides online instruction, information, and video interactive classes. He is proprietor of Miceli Music, LLC., incorporating the website: www.studymusiconline.com, which currently offers www.vibesworkshop.com. He enjoys endorsements with: Malletech; Applied Microphone Technologies and Beiner Bags.

Inferences are used to bridge current text ideas with antecedent text ideas of ideas in the reader's store of prior world knowledge. Text inferencing is an area of study within the field of cognitive psychology. Most of the information extracted from text is not understood as or remembered from things stated directly in that text, but from abstractions, inferences, and higher order understandings of the text material. Thus, inferences help maintain a coherent discourse representation by organizing and making sense of otherwise seemingly disjointed text ideasSchank, R. C. (1976). The role of knowledge in language processing. In C. Cofer (Ed.). The nature of human memory. San Francisco: W. H. Freeman. Types of Inferences Logical Inferences, Bridging (Backward) Inferences, and Elaborative (Forward) Inferences Forward Inferences made in text are generally said to be either \\"forward\\" or \\"backward\\" in relation to the current text idea. Forward inferences require the reader to bridge the current text idea to prior world knowledge, and are also referred to as \\"elaborative inferences.\\" Consider the following sentence:McKoon, G., & Ratcliff, R. (1986). Inferences about predictable events. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition. 12, 82-91. \\"The director and the cameraman were ready to shoot closeups when suddenly the actress fell from the 14th story.\\" This type of inference is also referred to as a \\"predictive inference\\" because the reader is inferring something about events to come. The experimental evidence has suggested that upon reading sentences such as that one, readers activate concepts such as \\"dead\\", suggesting that they inferred the actress died. Such an inference almost seems necessary if full comprehension of the story is to occur. Other types of elaborative inferences are inferences regarding characters or instruments described in the text. Predictive inferences are not made as reliably and not last as long in memory as other types of inferences,Keefe, D. E., & McDaniel, M. A. (1993). The time course and durability of predictive inferences. Journal of Memory and Language, 32, 446–463. and are largely based on the amount of biasing context provided by nearby text ideas Cook, A. E., Limber, J. E., & O’Brien, E. J. (2001). Situation-based context and the availability of predictive inferences. Journal of Memory and Language, 44, 220-234. Backward Backward inferences require the reader to bridge the current text idea to one that occurred earlier in the text. These types of inferences are also referred to as \\"bridging inferences.\\" For example, if a reader came across the following sentences together, they would need to have inferred that the sentences are related to one-another if they are to make any sense of the text as a whole: \\"Mary poured the water on the bonfire. The fire went out.\\" Singer, M., Halldorson, M., Lear, J. C., & Andrusiak, P. (1992). Validation of causal bridging inferences. Journal of Memory and Language, 31, 507-524. The type of inference drawn here is also called a \\"causal inference\\" because the inference made suggests that events in one sentence cause those in the next. Backward inferences can be either logical, in that the reader assumes one occurrence based on the statement of another, or pragmatic, in that the inference helps the reader comprehend the story coherently, like in the previous example.

He led a regiment at Hohenlinden, a brigade at Jena, Bussaco, and Fuentes de Onoro, and a division at Salamanca. He was mortally wounded while leading his soldiers against the Anglo-Allied army at the Battle of Vitoria. Sarrut is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe on Column 21. Revolution Sarrut was born on 16 August 1765 at Canté in what is now the department of Ariège, France, which is on the border with Spain. He became Chef de Brigade (colonel) of the 3rd Demi-Brigade de bataille on 28 May 1794. He transferred to command of the 8th Infantry Demi-Brigade on 19 February 1796. That year the 8th was serving with the Army of the North, but in 1797 the unit transferred to the Army of Germany.

The house was built in the late 18th century, using bricks between cypress studs. This type of construction, called briquettes entre poteaux or \\"brick between posts,\\" was used on the front and rear walls, with a type of adobe filling on the side walls. Rounded cement and brick columns supported the front veranda, or gallery, with wood columns on the second floor supporting the roof. History The builder and first owner of the house was sugar baron and slave owner, Pierre Trepagnier, who in the early 1780s was awarded a tract of land between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River by Spanish Governor Don Bernardo de Galvez, in recognition of Trepagnier's service in subduing the British at Natchez as an officer in the Louisiana Militia during the American Revolutionary War. The manor house was completed shortly before 1789 (or 1780) and occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Trepagnier (née Elizabeth Reynaud, m. 1777) and their eight children. The family grew indigo and then sugarcane on the property. There have been a handful of mysterious occurrences at Ormond Plantation. The first involved Mr. Trepagnier himself in 1798 when he was summoned from a family meal by a servant to notify him of a coach outside with a Spanish insignia. The servant was reported to have seen him meet a gentleman who was supposedly dressed in the clothing of a Spanish official. When the servant checked back, Trepagnier, the man and his coach had vanished and were never seen again. On June 25, 1805, Colonel Richard Butler, son and nephew of American Revolutionary War heroes bought the plantation home and land from Trepagnier's widow. He named the house Ormond, after his ancestral home, the Ormonde Castle in Carrick-on- Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland. In August 1809, Butler became a business partner with Captain Samuel McCutchon, a slave owner, merchant and sailor originally from Pennsylvania. On June 29, 1819 (ten years later, or fourteen years after acquiring the property), in a private pact signed at the plantation, Richard Butler turned over all of his holdings to McCutchon and he and his wife moved to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. No reason was ever given to explain why Butler sold the plantation although it is thought that it was an attempt at evading the local Yellow fever epidemic. If this was true then his attempts failed as it was reported that the fever had caught up with him and he died at age 43. There is some disagreement as to when the two existing wings, or garconnieres, were built. Some say that they were built around 1811 by Richard Butler while others believe they were built in 1830 by Captain McCutchon. The garconnieres (bachelor quarters) are what give Ormond Plantation House a unique look and are taller than the main part of the house. It is believed they were influenced by architecture from the Atlantic seaboard. Captain McCutchon's eldest son, Samuel B. McCutchon, married Adele d'Estrehan, the daughter of the owner of neighboring Destrehan Plantation, uniting two of the area's most powerful families. Samuel and his brother James William McCutchon took over the plantation upon the death of their father, and it continued to prosper. After the Civil War, the plantation fell on hard times and was sold twice before being sold two more times at public auctions in 1874 and 1875. On December 1, 1898, Ormond Plantation was purchased by State Senator Basile LaPlace, Jr, (son of New Orleans pharmacist and land owner after whom the town of LaPlace is named) who envisioned its use as a rice-producing enterprise. Mr. LaPlace was a well-known Justice of the Peace and then as a state senator, and also successfully managed the LaPlace land area left to him by his father. Legend has it that on the night of October 11, 1899 (less than one year after buying Ormond), he was found hanging from a large oak tree on the property with bullet holes in his body. It is believed that the assassination was carried out by members of the local Ku Klux Klan which he would likely have had disagreements with due to his position, however at the time it was also believed it may have been carried out by the caretaker and his son in revenge for LaPlace's apparent \\"philandering\\" with the caretaker's daughter; however there is no evidence to suggest either is true. After the LaPlace family, the Schexnaydre family purchased the plantation. Five Schexnaydre brothers (Joseph, Emilien, Barthelemy, Albert, and Norbet) each held a one-fifth share of the property. Emilien's family moved into the manor house, and at one time five Schexnaydre families lived there. This family held the property until 1926, when it was sold to the Inter-Credit Corporation. During the late 1920s and into the 1930s, a number of tenants occupied the house and the land. The home was allowed to deteriorate, until it was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Brown, owners of the Brown's Velvet Dairy in New Orleans. Beginning in 1943, the Browns undertook a major restoration, which included enclosing the carriageways and making the garconnieres a part of the main building. The Browns added modern conveniences such as indoor plumbing, natural gas, and electricity. After the death of Mrs. Brown, Mr. Brown sold Ormond to a real estate developer, Johnson & Loggins, who made minor but costly renovations in the manor house. In 1974, Johnson & Loggins sold the home and 17 acres of land to Betty R. LeBlanc, then executive vice- president of Barq's Beverages, Inc., in New Orleans. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mrs. LeBlanc began restoring the plantation house, which had begun to deteriorate due to the [inadequate?] renovations made by Johnson & Loggins. She was not able to see the renovations completed, succumbing to cancer in June 1986. Present day Ormond Plantation is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is owned by Irvin J. Carmouche. Mr. Carmouche continues to restore it and allows the manor home to be used for public tours along with weddings, luncheons, and other private events. Ormond is also operating as a bed and breakfast inn.

The music video was shot at the end of February in a studio in the Kanagawa prefecture. The filming was done completely in greenscreen, with 3D rendered computer graphics later added. Although the filming was mostly virtual, filming involved physical effects, such a trampoline for jumping scenes, a giant fan to simulate wind. In the music video, Kyary alternates between two characters, a ninja and a princess. Choreographer Maiko described the dancing as 'completely ninja', with shuriken throwing motion, high jumps, while still keeping a feminine side while singing 'blooming petals are dancing'. The clothes styles for the ninja are 'black clothes' and 'women's trousers', with a katana and head band chosen by Kyary. Kyary additionally commented that the outfit was 'really cool, they should sell it in Harajuku'. The other character is the 'badly behaved princess', with an antique kimono in 'shocking pink' color and an ornate hairpin (kanzashi) made specially to Kyary's taste. The opening scene shows Kyary riding on a Japanese koi fish with loving eyes, a pun on 'koi' which means love in the lyrics. Kyary already referenced The Drifters' Hige dance in her music video for Pon Pon Pon. Ken Shimura from The Drifters and Yuuka have a similar character to the badly behaved princess, stupid princess Yuuka.

It stars Salman Khan, Tabu, Daisy Shah, Aditya Pancholi and Danny Denzongpa. It also features Sunil Shetty and Genelia D'Souza in cameo appearances. The film is an official remake of the Telugu film Stalin (2006), directed by A. R. Murugadoss, which is also inspired from the American-drama film Pay It Forward. Jai Ho was released on 24 January 2014, during the Republic Day weekend. It received mixed reviews from critics. However, the film grossed 1.40 billion at the box-office.  Plot  Jai Agnihotri (Salman Khan) is an ex-army officer who is short-tempered and passionate about helping citizens and fighting criminals. He was a major in the Indian Army, but was suspended after he ignored orders from his superiors to rescue a group of children from terrorists. After this incident, Jai moved in with his mother and sister Geeta (Tabu). One day, Jai is unable to help Suman, a physically disabled girl (Genelia D'Souza), take an examination while her brother Rohan (Vikas Bhalla) was stuck in a traffic jam. A depressed Suman commits suicide. Jai is greatly disturbed by this incident. With Suman's death fresh in his mind, Jai creates a system that would encourage citizens to help each other. Each day, citizens are to help three people. These three people would in turn help three more people, and so on. Jai believes that this network would foster kindness and a sense of community among the citizens. His system, however, faces challenges. On one occasion, for one of his daily good deeds, Jai loses his temper and beats a rich man who had injured a child beggar. In an act of revenge, the rich man employs some men to kidnap Jai's sister Geeta and friend Rinky (Daisy Shah). Jai is able to save Geeta and Rinky, but injures one of the captors in the process, who happenes to be the henchman of a member of the Legislative Assembly named Patil, the son-in-law of the Home Minister Dashrath Singh. Dashrath is not pleased that Jai has injured one of Patil's henchmen. He attempts to avenge this injury by kidnapping Jai's nephew Kabir. Dashrath, however, loses Patil out of Jai's rage in the process. Chief Minister Ashok Pradhan (Mohnish Behl) meanwhile finds out about Jai's system after his own life is saved by a schoolgirl performing her good deeds for the day. He decides to intervene in the dispute between Dashrath and Jai in an attempt to put an end to their fight. Dashrath, who does not appreciate this intervention, attempts to kill Ashok and frame Jai. However, Jai is able to save Ashok. Dashrath's son Arjun Singh and his hired men attack Jai, who kills Arjun, but not before the latter is severely injured after getting stabbed by his sister and Patil's widow, Kavita (Sana Khan) and she being stabbed to her stomach. A rickshaw driver (Mahesh Manjrekar) and Jai's former colleague, Arjun Kaul (Suniel Shetty), together help Jai get to the hospital. While Jai is at the hospital, Dashrath spreads rumors that Jai had attempted to assassinate Ashok. Once he recovers, Ashok reveals that it was Dashrath and not Jai who was behind the attempted murder. An enraged crowd beats Dashrath to near death after hearing the truth. Doctors are able to save Jai, who has survived, thanks to his own help-three-people concept. When Jai emerges from the hospital, he finds thousands of people waiting for him. Jai thanks them all for making his concept a success and this is how the film ends.

From many accounts, LaBranche Plantation in St. Rose, Louisiana, was one of the grandest on the German Coast until it was destroyed during the Civil War. All that remained was the dependency house, known as a garconnière (French for bachelor quarters). History The Zweig family, immigrants from Germany, acquired the property and built the plantation big house and related buildings in 1792. The main building was destroyed during the Civil War. Following the division of the property among heirs in the late 19th century, there is little left to indicate that a grand mansion stood on the grounds except for an allée lined with oak trees. The late eighteenth-nineteenth century Creole dependency house, typically used for young bachelors and known in French as a garconnière, is significant because of its Federal woodwork and rarity as a surviving plantation dependency. Olidé and Marie Perilloux Cambre purchased the dependency house and property in 1902. Modern day The site where the manor house once stood is on private land and is not accessible to the public. The site of the Dependency House is on land currently owned by the Lentini family of Kenner. The Lentinis purchased and restored the dependency house in 1983.

Initiated in 2012 by Pascal Kaufmann, Roboy is the work of engineers who designed him according to design principles developed by Prof. Dr. Rolf Pfeifer, the AI lab director, in conjunction with the assistance of other development partners. Both the team members and the partners of the Roboy project share a commitment toward continued research in the area of soft robotics. Later Roboy was moved to Munich, Germany, where Rafael Hostettler conducts research on it at the Technical University. History=ECCE Robot= In general, standard humanoid robots mimic the human form, but the mechanisms used in them are very different from those that are in humans. The characteristics of these robots consequently reflect this difference. This places severe limitations on the kinds of interactions standard robots can engage in, the knowledge they can acquire of their environment, and thus on the nature of their cognitive engagement with the environment. Therefore, in 2011, a robotic project was launched in the European Union and it resulted in the development of the ECCE robot. Led by Professor Owen Holland of the University of Sussex, the ECCE project developed a new kind of robot that was modeled after the human anatomy. ECCE stands for Embodied Cognition in a Compliantly Engineered Robot, and the goal of the project was to develop an anthropomimetic robot whose body moves and interacts with the physical world in the same way flesh human bodies do. As athropomimetic, the robot copies not only the outward shape or form of a human body, but also copies the inner structures and mechanisms, such as bones, joints, muscles, and tendons. With these humanlike mechanisms the robot has the potential for human-like action and interaction in the world. Project objectives: * To design and build an anthropomimetic robot torso mounted on a powered mobile platform * To develop methods of characterising such robots in terms of the information flows emerging from their human-like intrinsic dynamics and sensory-motor coupling * To investigate ways of controlling the robot during movement, interaction, and mobile manipulation, and to combine the successful control strategies in a single architecture deploying them appropriately according to circumstances and tasks * To exploit the anthropomimetic nature of the robot in order to achieve some human-like cognitive characteristics through sensory-motor control * To evaluate the functional and cognitive abilities of the robot, both absolutely, and in comparison with a state of the art conventional robot The ECCE robot became a research platform. It uses many cables with a certain degree of elasticity to act as muscles and tendons. Like in a human body, all of the muscles and tendons need to be coordinated in order to get meaningful movement. To achieve this, there are 45 motors embedded in the robotic body that pull on the cables to make the body move. This allows the robot to have better potential to work in an unstructured human environment than a typical robot. The idea was to outsource the computation for the mechanics of the human body, like using passive compliance to make it absorb the energy in the right way to allow for safe interactions and to store energy in the muscles that can then be released to produce fast movements. =Development= With ECCE as its starting point, Roboy was conceived in 2011 via project coordination between research institutions and industry partners. One of their first breakthroughs was the anthropomorphic tendon-driven arm (ANTHROB), which served as example for how the rest of Roboy's body should function. Unlike more traditional robots, which have motors in their joints, Roboy is tendon-driven, allowing for more fluent, human-like movements. The walking movements of humans were acutely studied and then tweaked to result in a walking behavior similar to that of a human being. The anatomy of Roboy is very similar to the human anatomy. The spine consists of many vertebras connected by cords and balls to represent the spinal cord. As for the head and face of Roboy, it was designed completely from scratch and the community on Facebook collaborated to decide which head was the most liked. Further, Brain technology and Artificial Intelligence software which run the brain of Roboy can allow him to blush in certain situations, such as after receiving a compliment or while being hugged. In 2013, Roboy was to be presented at the \\"Robots on Tour\\" robotic fair that took place in Zurich, Switzerland on March 8. In order to achieve this, the development team had to finish the entire project in 9 months. This was made possible by means of crowdfunding. In return, all of the contributors' names were engraved on Roboy itself. The development of Roboy Junior, i.e. mechanic and software, was conducted Open source. Therefore, all the expertise, ideas, and inventions were not provided by just one specific entity so anyone had the chance to contribute to the technology . Today, Roboy Junior is meant to be an initial spark to trigger the work towards a generic anthropomimetic research platform.

The “muscles” of Roboy are modular, and replicated throughout his body. Myorobotics is taking this idea further, developing bone and joint modules as well in order to create a robotics toolkit for tendon driven robots that can be designed, simulated, optimized and controlled in one coherent framework. =The Human Brain Project= In the European Union 1 Billion € flagship Human Brain Project, simulated brains are being built. The Roboy team, in close collaboration with the head of the Neurorobotics part of the project, Prof. Alois Knoll from the Technical University of Munich, provides a basis for the robots to be used in the project. Muscolo-skeletal systems are natural partners for brains as they evolved together. Their goals are to find insights on how to control complex soft robots and also to bring virtual brains into physical reality. =The University of Melbourne= The robotics research group at the University of Melbourne has a strong theoretical background in controlling muscle-like tendon-driven systems. In a close collaboration with Dr. Darwin Lau and Dr. Denny Oetomo, the Roboy team provides them with their hardware, while in return their knowledge is being transferred into the software, improving the control and ability of Roboy.

History  The site was conceived after getting feedback from readers of The Daily Muse, the company's career-focused online publication, that indicated readers found the job searching frustrating and \\"would go through multiple rounds of interviews before realizing the company wasn't a great fit\\". Furthermore, users said the #1 annoyance for them in the job search was never hearing back from an employer after they'd applied. Based on this realization, the 3 founders decided to create a different kind of job site. The site was launched under the name Company Muse in February 2012, and is now known simply as The Muse. The Muse originally launched in Brooklyn as The Daily Muse on September 6, 2011, with eight editors and eleven columnists. The first version of the site grew from 20,000 users to 70,000 users in its first 3 months. In 2012, Minshew, Cavoulacos, and McCreery applied to Y Combinator at the recommendation of their advisor Rachel Sklar. They traveled to San Francisco for the interview and were accepted into the program that same day. The founders moved to Silicon Valley for 8 months during Y Combinator and the subsequent fundraiser, after which they decided to locate their headquarters in New York City starting in September 2012. \\"The diversity of the N.Y.C. tech and startup scene won us over\\" said in an interview by bizjournals.com.https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2016/09/09/minshews- manhattan-why-the-muse-ceo-ditched-san.html Including initial funding from Y Combinator, 500 Startups, and others, The Muse received $1.2 million in seed funding in January 2013 to continue growing the business. After re-branding to The Muse in June 2013, the company was a finalist in The Wall Street Journal Startup of the Year competition in Fall 2013. Tyra Banks and others invested $1 million in The Muse in February 2014. In May 2015, The Muse announced a $10 million Series A round led by Theresia Gouw at Aspect Ventures, with participation by DBL Partners and QED Ventures. In June 2016, the company raised $16 million in a Series B funding round led by Icon Ventures, with current investors Aspect Ventures, DBL Partners, and QED Investors participating.  Services  The Muse creates in-depth profiles of companies seeking top talent, showcasing their brand through behind-the-scenes videos of the office and team culture, interviews with employees, and current job openings. In a 2012 interview with Fast Company, founder Kathryn Minshew explained how the team creates “all the content” by sending someone into the office to capture everything needed to build a profile. The idea is to establish authentic and lasting connections between companies and candidates before the formal application process begins. In November 2016, The Muse launched \\"Coach Connect\\", a network of expert career coaches available to users seeking professional guidance in their job search. The service offers resume review and editing, career Q&As;, personalized job search or networking plans, and specialized coaching in interviewing, negotiation, and leadership. The Muse was a finalist in The Wall Street Journal \\"Startup of the Year\\" competition in Fall 2013. Kathryn Minshew, Alex Cavoulacos, and Melissa McCreery were number 59 on Business Insider’s 2012 Silicon Alley 100. Minshew and Cavoulacos made the list again as number 85 in 2015. Fast Company included The Muse in their Top 50 Enterprise, 2018 World's Most Innovative Company list, saying \\"businesses that hire through The Muse retain 95% of those employees for at least three months.\\" In October 2018, co-founder Kathryn Minshew was listed among Inc. (magazine)'s Female Founders 100 List, which included Tyler Haney of Outdoor Voices, Audrey Gelman of The Wing (workspace), and Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe.  Acquisitions  In June 2017 The Muse announced its acquisition of Chicago-based company, Brand Amper and rebranded it as Brand Builder. This deal represented the first tech acquisition for The Muse. In November 2018 they acquired San Francisco-based HR tech company TalentShare.

Statutory declaration 1 Balasubramaniam asked lawyer Americk Singh Sidhu for help in drafting his first statutory declaration. On 1 July 2008, the statutory declaration was made before the Commissioner of Oaths, Dr. T. Yokheswarem. Both Balasubramaniam and Yokeheswarem were born and raised in Slim River, Perak. On 3 July 2009, Balasubramaniam made a press conference in the headquarters of PKR in Petaling Jaya announcing his statutory declaration. In his SD, he accused the Prime Minister in the direct involvement in the murder of Altantuya a Mongolian national. The first SD was drafted with the help of Americk Singh Sidhu. Also attending the Press Conference is the opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and Shamsul Iskandar Md. Akin. Statutory declaration 2 On 4 July 2009, a second statutory declaration was held in Prince Hotel, Kuala Lumpur. Balasubramaniam stated that Deepak Jaikishan and a Malay VIP at The Curve, Damansara. The meeting was held outside a Volkswagen showroom on 3 July 2008. However, there is no evidence that this meeting ever took place. And it solely depends on the word of Balasubramaniam. He later then said that he was offered RM 5 Million to retract the statutory declaration.Peguam: Najib 'dikaitkan' dengan kehilangan Bala Running away After the Press Conference in Price Hotel, Balasubramaniam disappeared. Americk Singh failed to contact Balasubramaniam. Sivarasa has a strong feeling that Balasubramaniam was bribed. In Bangkok, ASP Suresh Kumar was said to have called Balasubramaniam from Kuala Lumpur so that police officers from Malaysia cannot catch him. Balasubramaniam then switched to the Hotel Beverly Hills. Deepak arranged the hotel expenses, approximately 100,000 baht. As Balasubramaniam's visa could not be renewed in Thailand, Deepak urged him to leave Bangkok as the Malaysian police were after him. From Bangkok's International Airport, Balasubramaniam and his family flew to Kathmandu. They then stayed in Yak & Yeti Hotel for 10 days. Visa arrangements to India was made by the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. Balasubramaniam later flew to New Delhi for two nights. He flew to Madurai and later to Madras. His visa expired on 21 August 2008. His wife and children were sent back to Kuala Lumpur to live with Balasubramaniam's mother-in-law in Segambut. ASP Suresh Kumar and Deepak Jaikishan reportedly visited Balasubramaniam in Chennai. Balasubramaniam stayed illegally in India because his visa was expired. The visa was later extended until 5 September 2009 with the help of the Exco of Karaikal, India, who happened to be his wife's uncle. Balasubramaniam then ordered his nephew, Kumaresan (27 years old) not to make any statement to the media and not to hold a candle light vigil for him.

History= Anecdotal History = A single, factual account of how the pigs ended up on the cay does not appear to exist. Folklore and various theories claim a number of different scenarios including pirates. Some say the pigs are said to have been dropped off on Big Major Cay by a group of sailors who wanted to come back and cook them. The sailors, though, never returned; the pigs survived on excess food dumped from passing ships. Another legend has it that the pigs were survivors of a shipwreck and managed to swim to shore, while other accounts claim that the pigs had escaped from a nearby islet. Yet others suggest that the pigs were part of a business scheme to attract tourists to the Bahamas while another claims the pigs were stocked on the island in the 1990s by residents of nearby Staniel Cay to raise for food. = Modern Day = The pigs are now fed by residents from neighboring islands and tourists and the island is unofficially known as Pig Beach by both locals and tourists. In 2017, a number of the resident pigs were found dead which caused speculation regarding the cause of death including claims of tourists feeding pigs alcohol or the pigs ingesting sand. Demographics and fauna  Big Major Cay is an island uninhabited by humans. The pig population was estimated between fifty and sixty pigs as of 2019. A few stray cats and goats can be found on the island as well.  Travel & Tourism  From Nassau to Pig Beach is 89 miles (143 km) and takes 2 hours by speed boat. A number of tour operators offer both private and group trips from Great Exuma, Staniel Cay, and other nearby cays.  Popular Culture  Pig beach has become a popular topic on social media sites like Instagram and featured in the television series, The Bachelor.

Mowat was born in Sunnhordland, probably on the Hovland farm at Tysnes which his father had acquired ca. 1590. Mowat was the son of Anders Mowat til Hovland (ca. 1530–1606) and Else Christoffersdatter til Seim (ca. 1550–1622), daughter of Danish-Norwegian Navy officer Kristoffer Throndsen. His father was engaged in trade between Norway and Shetland. Besides Hovland, his father acquired several other farms within the vicinity of Bergen. Axel Mowat was a naval officer in the Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy and from 1631 he was in command of various naval units in the North Sea. He had acquired property both through inheritance and marriage. After he retired from the admiralty in the 1640s, he started acquiring additional properties, mainly within Sunnhordland. He became the largest landowner in Western Norway at the time. Axel Mowat married Karen Bildt (d. 1662), daughter of Knud Danielssøn Bildt til Morland og Lungegården. He was the father of Karen Mowat (d. 1675) and father-in-law of Baron Ludvig Rosenkrantz (1628–85). In time, his properties would form the basis for the estate, Barony Rosendal.

It is scored for SATB soloists and choir, violins I and II, viola, 2 oboes, 2 horns, 2 clarini (high trumpets), 2 trumpets and basso continuo. Mozart composed the mass for the ordination of Cajetan Hagenauer, son of Lorenz Hagenauer, the Mozarts' landlord and family friend. Cajetan had entered St Peter's Abbey, a Benedictine monastery, whilst the Mozarts were on their grand tour. When he became a priest in 1769, he took the name Pater Dominicus and celebrated his first solemn high mass; this gives the work its nickname, Dominicusmesse. Leopold Mozart conducted the première on 15 October to a packed church in Salzburg; it is thought that the success of this performance led to Wolfgang's first Italian tour. Due to its length, the mass is classified as a missa solemnis. It is divided into six movements. 1\\\\. Kyrie Adagio, C major, common time : — \\"Kyrie eleison\\" Allegro, C major, 3/4 2\\\\.
