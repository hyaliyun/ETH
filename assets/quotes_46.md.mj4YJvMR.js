Her task was to carry stores, refrigerated items, and equipment to ships in the fleet, and to remote stations and staging areas. Valentine was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 2339) at Beaumont, Texas, by the Pennsylvania Shipyards, Inc. Launched on 3 February 1945 and sponsored by Mrs. P. Blaschke, the ship was placed \\"in service\\" on 19 June 1945 for ferrying and departed Beaumont on 25 June, bound for Galveston, Texas. There, at the Todd-Galveston Shipyard, Inc., Valentine underwent conversion to a refrigeration ship. She was commissioned at Galveston, Texas, on 19 July 1945, Lt. John W. Perdue in command.  World War II service  After shakedown and post-shakedown availability, Valentine departed Galveston on 2 August, bound for Mobile, Alabama. She loaded her first cargo of fleet supplies there and got underway on 10 August for the Pacific Ocean. While en route, the ship received word that Japan had surrendered on 14 August 1945. Valentine transited the Panama Canal on the 16th and departed Balboa shortly after noon on the 17th for the Hawaiian Islands.  Post-war activity  Valentine arrived at Pearl Harbor late in the morning of 5 September, discharged her first cargo, reloaded with fleet issue supplies over the ensuing days, and sailed for Okinawa on 21 September for onward routing.  Riding out a typhoon  Two days out of Buckner Bay, on 7 October, the barometer began to plummet; and, as Valentine's historian recorded, \\"all indications pointed to some pretty rough weather.\\" Aerology reports indicated that a typhoon was passing ahead of the ship, and it was expected, initially, to go up the China coast. However, late on the 8th, the storm's course changed. In view of that development, Valentine reversed course to stay out of its center. The ship rode out the typhoon; winds drove waves and spray as high as the bridge. By the morning of the 9th, the wind and waves had calmed sufficiently to enable the ship to continue on to Okinawa. Although buffeted about in the heavy seas, Valentine had fared much better than other ships of the fleet that had been trapped at Okinawa as the center of the typhoon swirled destructively across Buckner Bay.  Along the dangerous China coast  The refrigeration ship lingered at Buckner Bay from 1345 on the 11th to 1735 on the 12th before she got underway for the China coast. Arriving at Shanghai on the 16th, Valentine unloaded her cargo‚Äîpart of which consisted of Thanksgiving dinners for American servicemen stationed at that port‚Äîbefore she eventually weighed anchor for Hong Kong shortly after noon on the 25th. While leaving Shanghai via a swept channel, Valentine encountered a mine that she sank with gunfire in the middle of that waterway. Later on in her voyage to the British Crown Colony, as the ship passed the southern tip of Formosa, her lookouts sighted another stray mine ahead; a quick course change enabled the vessel to slip by within a narrow margin before she destroyed that mine, too, with gunfire to end its threat to shipping. Valentine arrived at Hong Kong at 0916 on 31 October, unloaded her cargo over the ensuing days, and sailed for home on 10 November. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 8 December to take on another load of fleet issue supplies. All hands had hoped for a \\"stateside\\" Christmas, but this was not to be, as Valentine weighed anchor for the Far East on 22 December‚Äîthree days before Christmas.  Servicing the American occupation troops in Japan  After the ship tarried at Okinawa, she was routed on to Japan, her holds laden with supplies for the American occupation forces. She touched at the Japanese ports of Sasebo, Kure, and Kobe, in succession, into late February 1946. She departed Kobe shortly before noon on 26 February and arrived back at San Francisco on 21 March. Loading cargo on a fleet issue basis, Valentine departed the west coast, one month later, on 21 April, bound again for the western Pacific. She remained at Pearl Harbor from 30 April to 5 May before she proceeded on toward the Marshalls and arrived at Majuro on the 13th. She provided fresh and frozen provisions to ships of the fleet at Kwajalein, Roi, Bikini Atoll, Eniwetok, and Wake Island before she returned via Pearl Harbor to the west coast, arriving at San Francisco on 16 July. During her brief service career, Valentine sailed and delivered 6,400 tons of cargo.  Decommissioning  Decommissioned at San Francisco on 6 August 1946, Valentine was transferred to the War Shipping Administration soon thereafter. She was struck from the Navy List on 8 October 1946. Final Disposition: she was sold by the Maritime Administration in 1967 and converted to fish factory ship. She was used as a processing vessel by All Alaskan Seafoods located in Seattle, WA. and was renamed ALL ALASKAN by that company. In the late 1980s she grounded off the coast of St Matthew Island, Alaska and became a total loss. Unable to be economically refloated, she was broken up where she grounded.

Roman objects such as coins, vases, skeletons and evidence of buildings have also been unearthed. This demonstrates that Ervillers was inhabited in Roman times, especially at the place called \\"Capieau\\". The parish was first recorded in the 12th century. The seigneurie of Ervillers has passed down through the families of Vi√©ville, Lalaing, Egmont, Luxembourg, and Diesbach-Belleroche. On 28 August 1654 Ervillers saw a visit from Louis XIV and the Queen mother, who lunched there while travelling on to P√©ronne and Arras, where the siege had been lifted by Marshal Turenne. Ervillers also has several underground shelters. They were probably old quarries and were turned into \\"muches.\\" One of these caves was about 20 meters underground and had 9 rooms, a corridor, a stable and animal pens. Wells provided both ventilation and a water supply. In December 1870 the Prussians pillaged the village. Ervillers was also the theatre of operations during the Battle of Bapaume (1871) in the Franco- Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71. The First World War saw the village suffer total destruction.

Geography A farming village situated 4 miles (6 km) southwest of Saint-Omer, on the D211 road. The A26 autoroute passes very close by. Etymology The village name first appears as Squerda in the year 857. Later known as Ekarde and finally as Esquerdes. History An ancient village, Esquerdes was on the Roman road, the Leul√®ne, that ran from Th√©rouanne to Sangatte on the coast. An archaeological survey of 1984 revealed traces of the Neolithic period (flint and carved bone) at two sites known as Les Tripoux and Le Paradis. The private Cr√®vecoeur farm, near the river, is made up of a number of buildings dating from the fifteenth century that belonged to John de Tr√©moillepuis and his son, Philippe de Cr√®vecoeur, who served under Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy and Kings Louis XI and Charles VII. He was appointed Marshal of France in 1483 and changed his surname to that of Esquerdes. The story of Esquerdes is linked to the development of two major industries of paper and gunpowder, which developed from the time of Louis XIV until the 19th century and which led to a large growth in population. In 1790, the town was large enough (with its 500 inhabitants) to be appointed chief town of the canton. Two hundred years or so later, this figure has more than tripled.

Linsky Ronald Benjamin Linsky (June 16, 1934 ‚Äì August 14, 2005) served as Executive Director of the National Water Research Institute (NWRI) for 15 years, where he was responsible for overseeing an institute dedicated to supporting cooperative research to create new sources of water and to protect freshwater and marine environments. Under his leadership, NWRI grew into the third largest water research institute in the United States. Linsky died at age 71 of myelodysplastic syndrome, a bone marrow ailment. Background Linsky was born during the Great Depression on June 16, 1934, in Los Angeles, California, to Walter and Helen Linsky. He attended the University of Southern California (USC) beginning in 1952, but put his education on hold when he volunteered to join the army. After 21 months as a private in the Army Security Agency, he was discharged for medical reasons after coming down with appendicitis, but completed his 8-year service through the army reserve. He returned to USC and continued studying biology, earning both his B.S. and M.S. degrees at the same time in 1962. Early career Floating Marine Laboratory, Fury II (late 1960s early 1970s) from postcard (Photographer William Weir) Immediately following his university education as a science teacher, Linsky began working at Westminster High School in Westminster, California. During the summer of 1963, he offered to teach marine biology as a summer school class. The course was so successful that, over the subsequent 5 years, Linsky went from biology teacher to Chairman of the Science Department at Westminster and Fountain Valley High Schools, as well as President of the District Education Association in the Huntington Beach Union High School District. He also became a research assistant at the University of California, Irvine, working in Back Bay Newport, and served on the Accrediting Commission for Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In 1967, he was offered a job as the Coordinator of Marine Sciences for the Orange County Department of Education in Santa Ana, California. There, he developed the Floating Laboratory Program, a federally funded project that drew thousands of people to learn hands-on marine science. Twenty school districts took part in the program in its first year of operation, and in 3 years, 32,000 students and their teachers had gone to sea with the Floating Lab. The program later expanded to include extended classes for college students, such as a weekend study session on Catalina Island and short cruises through the Channel Islands. Linsky began lecturing at various local libraries and colleges to inform people about topics such as marine mammals or ocean pollution. In 1969, he appeared at a 2-day State Marine Science Convention in Florida to encourage funding for water research. In the same year, he spent 1 month in Mexico City as a lecturer and consultant at the invitation of the Mexican Government to help develop marine science programs within the Mexican educational system. As part of that effort, he was the first North American educator to be invited to the Congresso Nacional de Oceanografica, where he conducted a 2-day workshop in oceanography for 1,200 selected educators, technicians, and scientists throughout Mexico. Though Linsky was becoming more and more recognized as an expert oceanographer, he had no formal training in the field. Despite this fact, he held marine science workshops at the University of California system and served as an advisor to the Fullerton College Oceanographic Technology Program. He was also appointed Vice President of Educational Affairs for both the American Society for Oceanography and the National Oceanography Association. Eventually, Linsky even worked with famous oceanographer Jacques Cousteau after being hired by Doubleday Multi-Media, Inc. to edit, re-script, develop, and market educational resource materials for The Undersea World of J.Y. Cousteau film series. The Sea Grant Program at the University of Southern California In 1970, several universities approached Linsky to recruit him to lead their ocean research programs. Linsky chose to work with his alma mater, USC, and began his career overseeing the brand-new Sea Grant Program. The program goals were to: train and educate the next generation of marine scientists and engineers; support research in marine resources management and development; and provide advisory services to the business and science communities, as well as the general public. During his Directorship, Linsky visited 15 countries in a 3-year period to conduct research, organize international conferences, or present at leading oceanographic institutions throughout the world. International Work with the Sea Grant Program North America Linsky was responsible for organizing bilingual international conferences and training programs in Mexico, including exploring the environmental impacts of opening the Trans-Peninsula Highway in Baja California. South Pacific Linsky traveled across French Polynesia, stopping in Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, New Zealand, and Australia to lecture and investigate marine resources development programs. Asia He toured Thailand and India as a lecturer and consultant in marine and coastal resources planning and development. Europe As a member of the National Academy of Engineering‚Äôs Committee on Ocean Research, he worked with Great Britain, France, and Germany to encourage information exchange and to expand knowledge in the field of integrated coastal zone management. A year later, he traveled through Great Britain, Scotland, Ireland, Norway, and the Netherlands on an NOAA-sponsored research grant to study the impacts of North Sea oil exploration and development upon the coasts. Directorship in Hawaii In 1975, Linsky decided to direct the Sea Grant Program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH). The Sea Grant programs at USC and UH were different in that USC was dealing with the management of existing resources while Hawaii, made up of eight main islands rich in resources, needed to better plan its marine future. Linsky directed much of the Sea Grant program's funding (UH had the largest in the nation) towards research for improving aquaculture and fisheries. Aquaculture became such an important component of Linsky's work that he became Special Assistant to the Dean of the College of Tropical Agriculture for aquaculture research and development in 1977. One of his greatest accomplishments at the time was the creation of a statewide market for the aquaculture industry in Hawaii, representing more than and $5 million in investments. Independent career In 1978, Linsky ended his service as Director of Sea Grant in Hawaii and moved back to California to work for himself. He was soon contracted by the United Nations (UN) to work in Southeast Asia. His first job with the UN involved planning and conducting a workshop on developing coastal and offshore resources in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. A contact from the workshop sent him to Sri Lanka twice to serve as a consultant and UN rep in coastal resource development. Linsky then moved to the Caribbean to become the UN's Chief Technical Advisor and, later, CEO of the Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) in Trinidad and Tobago. He spent 2 years working hard to establish the IMA in a developing country with diminishing offshore resources. In the process, he built a laboratory, purchased an ocean research ship, and established programs revolving around the fishing industry, coastal zone management, education, and advisory services. He also introduced aquaculture as a viable resource. National Water Research Institute In 1991, Linsky was selected to become the founding Executive Director of the National Water Research Institute (NWRI), a non- profit organization devoted to creating new sources of water through research and technology. Linsky was known for his pioneering spirit and willingness to fund new and exciting technology to explore its benefit to the water industry. One of Linsky's earliest projects with NWRI included traveling to Oman to help establish the Middle East Desalination Research Center. The center was created to research desalination technology and share knowledge in the Middle East and North Africa, with the express purpose of encouraging these countries to work together on the same problem. More recently, he was involved with introducing and encouraging the use of riverbank filtration, a predominately European drinking-water treatment process, within the United States. He had also planned to introduce this low-cost technology to developing nations by holding a conference in China in 2006. Linsky was also internationally known and respected for his advocacy and belief in the value of water. He encouraged the concept of viewing water as an asset that provides services that are valued by the consumer. To Linsky, the value of water was not just the cost of treating and distributing it; it was in the ability to enjoy a day at the beach, drought-proof a region, or purchase a product, like a newspaper or pair of jeans, that could not be manufactured without water. Altogether, NWRI had supported over 160 water-related projects under Linsky's directorship, focusing on the areas of exploratory research, treatment and monitoring, water quality assessment, and knowledge management. Awards * 2005: Southern California Water Committee, Inc. Lifetime of Achievement Award * 1971: Premi Tridente d‚ÄôOra Ustica Oceanographic Institution, Italy ** Awarded for outstanding contributions in the field of Oceanography. The NWRI Ronald B. Linsky Fellowship for Outstanding Water Research One of Linsky's greatest passions was education. He believed that it is essential to support and encourage young people who are interested in water science. Whether that was through giving out awards at science fairs or in sending kids to Water Camp, Linsky ensured that NWRI took an active role in educational outreach programs. For instance, he loved to invite secondary school students to dinner to meet experts in the water industry at NWRI's Research Advisory Board meetings. Whenever a young person called asking for an internship or scholarship to help attend a water festival, he immediately made arrangements to help them out. In 2006, NWRI established a fellowship in honor of Linsky's memory as part of NWRI's graduate fellowship program. Funding for this special fellowship was contributed by Patricia Linsky, Dr. David and May Hsu, Dr. Stephen Lyon, H.S. and Ponnamma Muralidhara and the Joan Irvine Smith/Athalie R. Clarke Foundation.

As of the 2010 census the population was 595. Despite its population and numerous businesses, it is often listed in tourist guides as a ghost town, because of the number of historic buildings left from its days as a gold- mining town. Kerby came into existence between 1854 and 1857.  History  Kerby was named for James Kerby (or Kerbey, as he sometimes spelled his name). The community was founded during the heyday of Josephine County gold mining and went through numerous name changes (and various spellings) in its early years. When Josephine County was established on January 22, 1856, a new county seat was to be chosen in the next county election. The original county seat was a place called \\"Sailor Diggings\\" (which was eventually renamed Waldo). One of the polling places listed was called \\"Kirbey's Ranch\\". James Kerby and Samuel Hicks, partners in a general mercantile and supply business, probably founded the town of \\"Kerbeyville\\" for the county seat race, and the town was selected in the election of June 1857. An act of the territorial legislature of December 18, 1856, changed the name from \\"Kirbeyville\\" to \\"Napoleon\\", possibly because of the association of Napoleon with the name Josephine. The new name was not popular, and a bill was introduced in the next legislature that would change it back. The bill passed the House but was then held up in the Senate judiciary committee. Though the county commissioners used the name \\"Napoleon\\" for a short time, they reverted to calling the place \\"Kerbyville\\" in about April 1860. The name \\"Kerbyville\\" was used officially for many years despite the failure of the legislature to restore it. The name was finally changed to \\"Kerby\\" for the sake of simplicity. Grants Pass became the county seat in 1886. The history of the name of the post office in this locale is simpler: Kerby post office was established in September 1856; it was later made a rural station of Cave Junction. The post office was proposed to be closed in 2009. Geography Kerby is in southwestern Josephine County, along U.S. Route 199 on the east side of the valley of the Illinois River, a north- flowing tributary of the Rogue River. Kerby is bordered to the south by the city of Cave Junction. US 199 leads northeast to Grants Pass and south through Cave Junction to Crescent City, California.

The theory postulates that living human systems survive, develop, and transform from simple to complex through discriminating and integrating information. Corresponding to the small and rigorously defined set of concepts, SCT defines a set of methods, techniques and instruments.'Systems-Centered Theory' SCT practitioners use these with individuals, couples and groups to explore the experience of their differences and work with these to integrate them. Using the method of functional subgrouping, these living human systems increase their ability to see both sides of their issues and resolve them productively.Susan Gantt, in Jeffrey L. Kleinberg, The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Group Psychotherapy (2011) p. 115 The theory was first developed in Agazarian's 1997 book, Systems-Centered Therapy for Groups,\\"Systems- Centered Therapy for Groups\\" and grew out of her earlier work in group psychotherapy under the influence of such figures as W. R. Bion and John Bowlby through the further input of the general systems theory of Ludwig von Bertalanffy.Yvonne Agazarian, A Systems-Centered Approach to Inpatient Group Psychotherapy (2001) Systems-centered theory explains how living human systems contain their energy within functional boundaries and direct it towards their goals: the primary goals of survival and development and the secondary goals of environmental mastery. In SCT training groups, all members work in functional subgroups rather than work alone. Subgroups work both sides of every issue in the group-as-a-whole. This practice strengthens both the therapeutic capacity of the training group and allows individual members to choose which side of the conflict has therapeutic salience for their own personal work.  Theory of Living Human Systems: an introduction  Systems- centered therapy and consultation developed by Yvonne Agazarian is based on the Theory of Living Human Systems, a theory that can be applied to any living human system as small as one individual or a large group and couples, families, classrooms, committees, businesses or even nations.Arthur Robbins, Therapeutic Presence (1998) p. 163-4 Thus the theory offers a set of ideas for thinking about how living human systems work that can be applied at any level. The theory defines \\"a hierarchy of isomorphic systems that are energy- organizing, self-correcting and goal directed\\" ‚Äì working on the assumption that psychic patterns will be repeated in the same form (isomorphy)at every nested level of interaction.Robbins, p. 164 Each of these constructs is then operationally defined with methods developed that test the hypothesis of the theory. In this way, it offers a comprehensive systems theory and methodology of practice that can be applied in clinical, organizational and educational settings. Most importantly, Agazarian's theory of living human systems introduces the hypothesis that the single essential process by which living human systems survive, develop and transform is by discriminating and integrating differences.  Working with differences  Differences are challenging for people, whether they are differences in opinions, beliefs, ideas, wishes, or feelings. Differences are challenging even when we find them inside of ourselves. Groups often respond to differences that are \\"too different\\" by ignoring the differences, avoiding the differences, trying to change or convert the differences or blaming, judging or scapegoating the differences.Yvonne M. Agazarian, 'The Difference between Functional and Stereotype Subgroups' Groups that respond in these ways to differences can survive unchanged for a long time since anything that challenges the status quo does not become incorporated into the group or is rejected by the group. Because of this tendency, Systems-centered therapists or consultants pay a lot of attention to communication within the system. They are particularly looking to reduce the defensive \\"noise\\" within the communication.Yvonne M. Agazarian, Systems-Centered Therapy for Groups (2004) Noise is defined as contradictions, (Simon and Agazarian), ambiguities and redundancies (Shannon and Weaver). This concept of noise was developed from work by Shannon and Weaver who formulated observations about the inverse relationship between noise and information transfer. By highlighting and reducing contradiction, ambiguities, and redundancies, i.e. \\"noise\\", communication is more effective in transferring information and the system has a better chance of discriminating and integrating its differences. According to the theory of living human systems, groups that are able to take in and use differences are able to not only survive but also develop and transform.Yvonne M. Agazarian, 'The Difference between Functional and Stereotype Subgroups This kind of development enables groups to use their differences as resources to find solutions to problems that are more comprehensive and responsive to the complexity of the problem. They are able to move with less difficulty toward their goals. Functional subgrouping In systems-centered therapy, members are taught to manage differences and resolve conflicts by a technique called functional subgrouping.'Innovations on Systems-Centered Theory and Training Rather than individual members working alone, functional subgrouping requires that all members of a system that are similar work together to deeply explore their similarity.Susan Gantt, in Jeffrey L. Kleinberg, The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Group Psychotherapy (2011) p. 113 When that subgroup finishes its exploration, the subgroup holding a difference begins its work, exploring their similarities with one another. Inevitably, as the members of a subgroup talk with each other, they discover differences (i.e., differences within the apparently similar) within their subgroup and also, find similarities with the other subgroup (similarities in the apparently different). By using functional subgrouping, the whole group has a better chance of integrating its differences rather than rejecting differences. When a group can make use of its differences it becomes more complex and interesting akin to the way music is enriched by harmonies or interwoven themes. The group moves from the survival of the status quo to development and transformation. SCT clients learn through experience. By exploring one's experience rather than explaining it, members learn to tell the difference between comprehensive understanding (words first, experience second) and apprehensive understanding (experience first, words second). Clients learn to restore the connection between their comprehensive, thinking self and their emotional, intuitive self. Learning this skill leads to \\"containing\\" the energy and gaining the knowledge that frustrations and conflicts arouse, rather than discharging, binding or constricting it in defensive symptoms. Energy in SCT is understood as the ability of the group or individual to work towards its goals.  Working with perspectives  Another important part of the theory of living human systems is that groups function more effectively when there is the capacity to shift perspective from the perspective of the individual to the perspective of the whole group. Being able to shift perspective from seeing things from the perspective of a person in a group (or couple or family or business, etc.) to the perspective of a member of the group creates a climate of mutual work toward a common goal. Individuals who are able to make the shift from the perspective of an individual to the perspective of a member or systems- centered perspective are less likely to take personally the inevitable challenges that arise as a human system moves toward its goal. When we take things less personally, we are less likely to get bogged down in frustration, hurt feelings and unproductive arguments. When we understand ourselves in the context of the systems that we belong to and co-create - our families, schools, businesses, labor unions, political parties, churches, sports clubs - we not only participate in their tasks, we are also involved in their development: establishing the distribution of authority and the degree of trust that help these systems survive and grow. Doing this, we contribute to the system balance between innovation and continuity, and at the same time strike a balance between our own desire to learn and our want for security.  Phases of development  The systems-centered methods which developed from the theory of living human systems offers a map of predictable phases for the development of human systems.Agazarian, Y. Systems-Centered Therapy for Groups. 1997, Guilford, London In the first phase of development, a system comes to terms with the issues of giving and taking authority and with the authority that resides in the members. Successful management of this phase leads to cooperation between members and between members and leaders. Unsuccessful management of this phase results in members behaving defiantly or compliantly which inevitably undermines the group's development. In the second phase, called the intimacy phase, the group wrestles with the challenges of closeness and distance from fellow members. This is the phase of team building for workgroups and the phase in which the issues related to separation and individuation are explored in therapy groups. As the group works in this phase it explores the pull to becoming enchanted with itself or becoming disenchanted and falling into despair with no energy to do its work. Successful management of this phase allows members to gain greater access and intimacy with themselves and also to work together with others in a climate of tested and mutual trust. In the third phase of development, the group has the opportunity to develop a greater access to its emotional and rational intelligence and develops the capacity to use that information effectively in the service of the group's goals. The group works more efficiently as it is more able to accept the reality of the role each member plays in the group, and stays more connected to the goal of the group and the reality of the environment in which the group is working. Successfully managing the challenges of these phases of development means that the system is capable of developing an effective distribution of authority, establishing a climate of trust, and developing the capacity for system adaptation and learning. Wheelan (2005) has shown that work groups that are more developed in their phases have increased productivity.  As psychotherapy  The theory of living human systems has been applied to psychotherapy as well as to business, organizational and educational consultation. In its application to psychotherapy, a unique aspect of this theory is that it is equally applicable to both individual and couples psychotherapy and to group psychotherapy. SCT posits that much of a person's suffering is related to viewing oneself only from the perspective of the individual self, a person-centered view. By developing a capacity to see oneself from the perspective of the system one is a part of, a systems-centered perspective, the psychotherapy client is able to more consciously influence their own development and the development of the systems they are a part of. A SCT therapist uses the phases of development described in the theory of living human systems to systemically train a client to recognize states of mind that interfere with reaching the client's goal. These interfering states of mind are referred to as defenses. Two of the most common defenses that bring people to psychotherapy are anxiety and depression; these are addressed in the first phase of treatment. Clients are taught how to recognize and reduce these defenses so that they are freed to traverse life less painfully and more smoothly. SCT work is a partnership in which the therapist governs the structure of the therapy and clients make a series of manageable choices at different \\"forks in the road\\".J. Donigian/D. Hulse- Killacky, Critical Incidents in Group Therapy (1999) p. 183 Each fork is a choice a person makes between familiar defenses and experiencing the emotion, conflict or impulses that triggered the defense. The Systems-Centered therapist teaches the client to systematically weaken the defense, such as anxiety or tension, in a structured sequence that matches the client's ability to choose. As each defense is undone, the client can choose to take the fork in the road away from the symptoms generated by their defensive responses, and towards discovering the conflicts, between their emotions or impulses and the fears of their emotions or impulses, that were being defended against. As SCT psychotherapy proceeds, the client acquires skills that increase their ability to undo their own defenses. Through this process, clients regain their ability to use their common sense, (and existential humor!) to manage the every day conflicts between themselves and reality. Clear outcome criteria for each step are in the sequence of defense modification locates the client in the SCT treatment plan. Because each defense modification addresses a specific symptom, therapy can be delivered either continuously or chunked into modules. SCT can therefore be applied to the goals of both short-term and long-term therapy. Criticism Irvin D. Yalom has seen the formation of subgroups as a negative indicator in the context of group therapy.Gantt, in Kleinberg, p. 114  See also  *Family therapy *Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy *Liminality *Role suction References Further reading *Agazarian, Y.M.

Biography Evening Conversation, 1956, William Cumming. Collection of Woodside/Braseth Gallery. Cumming was born March 24, 1917 in Kalispell, Montana, to James Rutherford and Helen Dorcas (Edmiston) Cumming.1930 United States Federal Census [Tukwila, King County, Washington, USA] (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2002. His father was a salesman. The family moved to Portland, Oregon, and then, when Cumming was seven, to Tukwila, Washington, a farming community south of Seattle. Fascinated with art, young Bill took drawing courses by correspondence and travelled on weekends to the Seattle Public Library, where he taught himself art history. From an early age he was aware of the work of the local artists - such as Morris Graves, Mark Tobey, and Kenneth Callahan - who would later become known as the 'Northwest School'. After graduating from Foster High School in 1934, he briefly attended a small, short-lived private art school in Seattle. With the Great Depression in full swing, he lived at the family home in Tukwila while taking occasional art lessons and attempting to show his work to prospective employers. He failed to find work, but his enthusiasm and impressive drawing skill led to meeting many of the members of Seattle's small art community, and a job (unpaid) writing for local arts journal The Town Crier. He was eventually hired by Robert Bruce Inverarity, sketching, photographing, and doing odd jobs with the WPA's Federal Art Project, through which he met Morris Graves and his circle of friends. He became particularly close to artist/writer Margaret Callahan, who encouraged him greatly in developing an original painting style. The Seattle Art Museum bought three of his paintings, and in 1940 he won top prize for watercolor in SAM's 26th Northwest Annual Exhibition. In 1941 the museum gave him his first solo exhibition. Cumming's career was interrupted on occasion by both his political leanings, and by bouts of tuberculosis. He spent most of World War II in Firland Sanatorium. In 1945 he became a member of the Communist party. He was blacklisted by employers and alienated the arts community with his shrill Stalinism; he created little fine art in this period. In 1957, after three marriages and further severe pulmonary problems, he quit the Communist party and began taking greater care of himself. His health improved considerably, and he began the most productive part of his career. He also began teaching at Burnley School of Professional Art (which became the Art Institute of Seattle), and later at Cornish College of the Arts Despite his renunciation of radical politics, issues of social justice and workers' rights remained important to him throughout his life.'The late Bill Cumming: colorful art, colorful character' (no byline), The Bellevue Reporter, Dec. 2, 2010 Although Cumming was close friends with most of the artists identified as members of the 'Northwest School', his mature work had little to do with the earth-toned, nature-inspired abstraction of the genre. His art was usually figurative, capturing moments of daily life using light and shadow to create form in broad strokes, and utilizing contrasting, vibrant colors to move the viewer through the painting and accentuate the main elements. His scenes usually included people or animals, either in motion or in slice-of-life portrayals. Facial details are minimal. As a life drawing instructor, Cumming would note that you could recognize a friend down the road just by their gait and posture, without ever seeing their face. Body language is a key element in his work. In the late 1950s and early 60s Cumming's work won prizes in several northwest competitions, and in 1961 the Seattle Art Museum presented a very successful solo exhibition. During his marriage to Sue Kruger (at seventeen years, the longest of his seven marriages) he moved to Upper Preston, Washington, where the two raised horses, which became a frequent subject of Cumming's art. He continued teaching for the rest of his life, becoming well known for his outspoken opinions. He derided the pretensions of fine art, declaring that his favorite painter was Eustace Ziegler, a popular painter of romantic Alaskan landscapes. Cumming authored Sketchbook, A Memoir of the 30's & the Northwest School, which was published in 1984.Sketchbook: William Cumming; Amazon book profile; https://www.amazon.com/Sketchbook-William-Cumming/dp/0295985607; retvd 8 4 14 Another book, William Cumming: The Image of Consequence,William Cumming: The Image of Consequence; Amazon book profile; https://www.amazon.com/William-Cumming-The-Image-Consequence/dp/0295985550 retvd 8 4 14 by Cumming and Matthew Kangas, was also published in 2005, in conjunction with an exhibition of Cumming's work at the Frye Art Museum.

Background Out of Body marked a series of firsts for The Hooters. It was their first album for MCA Records after having released their three previous albums on Columbia Records. It was the first time they had worked with producer Joe Hardy, whose credits included ZZ Top, Steve Earle and Tom Cochrane. Also, The Hooters had become a six-piece band for the first time, after the addition of violinist and singer Mindy Jostyn. Band members Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman first met Jostyn backstage after a 1989 Billy Joel concert at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. She was given a copy of their previous album Zig Zag and two years later, in December 1991, they called her in New York and asked to get together with them. Jostyn officially joined the band in January 1992. The recording process for Out of Body was also significantly different than their previous efforts. Rather than allow the band to work on a song significantly before recording, as they had always done, producer Joe Hardy took tracks directly from The Hooters' demos and made them \\"commit and move on.\\" The resulting album was recorded in just four weeks, whereas previous albums by the band had taken four to six months to record. One of the songs on the album, \\"Private Emotion,\\" would go on to become an international hit single for Ricky Martin in 2000, with both Hyman and Bazilian contributing to the new recording.

One species is named, V. hebeiensis. The holotype fossil is in the collection of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Its catalog number is CAGS 130722. The fossil was found in Early Cretaceous rocks first attributed to the Yixian Formation, Senjitu, Fengning County, Hebei Province, China. However, later study of area geology showed that these rocks actually belong to the Huajiying Formation.Jin, F., Zhang, F.C., Li, Z.H., Zhang, J.Y., Li, C. and Zhou, Z.H. (2008). \\"On the horizon of Protopteryx and the early vertebrate fossil assemblages of the Jehol Biota.\\" Chinese Science Bulletin, 53(18): 2820-2827. Vescornis was described in detail by Zhang et al. in 2004.Zhang, Fucheng., Ericson, Per G.P., Zhou, Zhonghe. (2004) \\"Description of a new enantiornithine bird from the Early Cretaceous of Hebei, northern China\\" Canadian Journal of Earth Science 41: 1097 - 1107 Possible synonyms The three taxa Jibeinia, Vescornis, and \\"Hebeiornis\\", may be synonyms. If so, because the name Jibeinia was published in 1997, it would be the senior synonym and take priority.Hou, Lianhai (1997) \\"Mesozoic Birds of China\\" Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing, China. Published by the Phoenix Valley Provincial Aviary of Taiwan. In Chinese, translated by Will Downs, Bilby Research Center, Northern Arizona University, January, 2001. However, there is no consensus over whether or not they are actually synonyms, and some scientists continue to regard them as separate species. When Vescornis was described in 2004, the authors noted that it was nearly exactly the same size as Jibeinia, and collected from the same locality. They noted several morphological similarities to Jibeinia but, also, distinct differences in some characters from the written description. They sought to compare the two specimens but learned from Dr. Hou in 2001 that the holotype Jibeinia had been lost, and existing casts were of too poor a quality to be decisive. Thus they conclude that it will be impossible to verify whether the two are the same species, unless the holotype of Jibeinia is rediscovered. The name \\"Hebeiornis\\" was published in 1999, based on the same specimen as Vescornis (CAGS 130722). However, the describers (Xu et al.) gave little anatomical detail and few comparisons to other taxa, and later researchers have concluded that this was not an adequate description to establish the new name, and it is now regarded as a nomen nudum.Xu, G.L., Yang, Y.S., Deng, S.Y.

It was a Motte and triple bailey castle, surrounded by a moat, mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being owned by Hugh the Fleming. The castle was in ruins prior to the early part of the 17th century, when a new Podington Manor, now referred to as \\"Old Podington Manor\\", had been built just forward of its location. The new Podington manor became a farmhouse in 1694, when the owners moved their residence elsewhere. The extensive earthworks remains of the castle can still be located, on the mound, in the field at the back of Old Podington Manor. Building foundations were still visible as of 1972.

Species of this genus have usually thickened pedipalps with stiff, fine hairs, which is unique among harvestmen. Although the small eye tubercle is usually not ornamented, there is a spine on one Nepalese species. Males have long, thin legs, females are stouter.Shear 1975 The genus is widespread in the temperate northern hemisphere, even extending into the subarctic, with the most southern records from caves in the southeastern United States and high elevations in Nepal. The center of diversification seems to be in Asia, where many species were described from Japan, Korea and Nepal. Some species occur in Europe. While the Asian and North American species are easy to differententiate from one another by male genital traits, the few European species are very similar, and seem to be closely related to S. cavicolens. S. mitchelli, which, like the larger S. cavicolens, occurs in the eastern US, is quite different from the latter, with males lacking cheliceral glands. Species from the western US seem most closely related to Asian forms. S. astoriensis is very similar to S. dentipalpe and S. makinoi; it was collected from dried seaweed and debris in beach dunes. Almost all Sabacon species prefer moist, cool microhabitats, and many species live in caves, but none are modified for cave life. Outside of caves they are often found in forests or shaded ravines.

The most widely spoken languages in North America (which includes Central America and the Caribbean islands) are English, Spanish, and to a lesser extent French, and, especially in the Caribbean, creole languages lexified by them. Indigenous languages North America is home to many language families and some language isolates. In the Arctic north, the Eskimo‚ÄìAleut languages are spoken from Alaska to Greenland. This group includes the Aleut language of the Aleutian Islands, the Yupik languages of Alaska and the Russian Far East, and the Inuit languages of Alaska, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Greenland.Eskimo‚ÄìAleut Language Family, accessed 2007-08-31.

The Algic languages, including the large Algonquian branch, are widespread across Canada and the United States; they include Cree, Anishinaabe (Ojibwe), Mi'kmaq, and Blackfoot.Algonquian Language Family, accessed 2007-08-31. The Iroquoian languages dominate the area around the Saint Lawrence River and the eastern Great Lakes, but also include Cherokee.Iroquoian Languages, accessed 2007-08-31. The Siouan‚ÄìCatawban languages, including Crow and Sioux, dominate the Great Plains. Many small language families are spoken in the Pacific Northwest from British Columbia to California. The Uto-Aztecan languages are found throughout the Western United States, northern and central Mexico, and as far south as El Salvador; they include Hopi, O'odham, and Nahuatl (descended from Aztec).Uto-Aztecan Language Family, accessed 2007-08-31.

The Chibchan languages are spoken in Costa Rica and Panama as well as South America.Macro-Chibchan , accessed 2007-08-31. Introduced languages The most widely spoken language in North America is English, followed in prevalence by Spanish and French. These three languages were brought to North America as a result of colonization of practically the entire continent by settlers from Europe. English is the predominant language of Canada, the United States, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands, and is spoken alongside English-based creole languages in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Virgin Islands. It is also the official language of Dominica and Saint Lucia, where the French- based Antillean Creole is also widely spoken. Spanish is the dominant language in Mexico and all of Central America apart from Belize, as well as Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico (where English is spoken as well); it is also widely spoken in the United States.Ethnologue report for Spanish, accessed 2007-08-31. French is the dominant language in Quebec and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and is spoken in Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Louisiana. It is spoken alongside French-based creole languages in Saint Lucia, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Martinique, Saint Barth√©lemy, and the French side of Saint Martin.Ethnologue report for French, accessed 2007-08-31. French is one of the two official and national languages of Canada. Russian was once widely spoken in Alaska as it was the language of administration, commerce, and the settlers there that often intermarried with the locals (they numbered no more than a thousand), creating a sizable biracial population. The language began to decline after the United States purchased the land from the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, the language, called \\"Old Russian\\" by its speakers, is still spoken today in parts of Alaska like Ninilchik and Kodiak by descendants of Russian colonists and Russified Alaskan Natives and is known for its archaic Russian vocabulary and indigenous influences, though the vast majority of speakers are elderly, so that this unique Russian dialect is heavily endangered.Golovko, Evgeny. 2010. \\"143 Years after Russian America: the Russian language without Russians\\". Paper read at the 2010 Conference on Russian America, Sitka, Alaska, August 20, 2010. In addition, a Russian creole/mixed language known as Medny Aleut language was once spoken in some of the Aleutian Islands. Only a few elderly people still speak it. There has also been sizable recent immigration from Russia in the past few decades, leading to a new generation of Russian-speaking Alaskans. Though no German state played a major role in the European colonization of the Americas, German people did found their own colonies. Pennsylvania German, Hutterite German, Texas German, all of which developed in North America, as well as Plautdietsch are spoken by descendants of these settlers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Other introduced languages include Danish in Greenland,Ethnologue report for Greenland, accessed 2007-08-31 where it is spoken by nearly everyone (mostly as a second language) due to centuries of colonization by Denmark. Danish was once the language of administration of the US Virgin Islands before the purchase by the United States. Dutch in Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, where it is spoken alongside the Portuguese Creole language in Papiamento.Ethnologue report for Aruba, Ethnologue report for Netherlands Antilles , accessed 2007-08-31. In modern times North America has immigrant speakers of many languages from around the world. For details see Languages of Canada, Languages of the United States, and Languages of Mexico. Some historic languages include Gholan Language and Quechua. Indians were brought to the Caribbean from South Asia during the mid-19th century to the early 20th century to work on the sugar cane, cocoa bean, rice and coffee bean plantations after slavery was abolished. Caribbean Hindustani is spoken by Indo-Caribbeans in islands in the Caribbean like Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica where a majority of the Indians are North Indian. Tamil and Telugu was spoken as the lingua franca of Indians in islands like Martinique and Guadeloupe, where the majority of Indians are Dravidians (South Indians). Recent immigration beginning in the 1960s from India to Canada and the United States has increased the prevalence of Indian languages in those countries, with Punjabi once had the highest ranking in Canada among Indian languages, being the third most-spoken language by the 2011 Canadian census. But now in the most recent 2016 census, Punjabi has been superseded by Mandarin and Cantonese to be the fifth. Today, Hindi, Urdu, and other South Asian languages are also spoken throughout North America.

Next summer he was back in Serbia ready to make a debut in the Serbian SuperLiga with the newly promoted side FK Javor Ivanjica. However fierce competition in the squad made him want to search for a place where he could get more chances, choosing to move abroad again, this time to Albanian Superliga side KS Apolonia Fier where he played until the winter break of the 2009‚Äì10 season.

She was formerly the General Counsel and Senior Vice President for Corporate and Community Affairs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  Biography  McGovern holds a bachelor's degree and law degree from Suffolk University. She also studied at The Hague Academy of International Law. McGovern served in the Massachusetts Senate for 12 years, from 1981 to 1993, and was the first woman to chair the powerful Massachusetts Senate Committee on Ways and Means. While the Chair of that Committee McGovern was the principal architect of the first serious effort in Massachusetts to enact a universal health insurance law. Under her stewardship, such a law was enacted in 1988 - with the controversial inclusion of a payroll tax - but the law was never implemented by the newly elected Governor of the Commonwealth, the Republican William Weld, because of his opposition to the payroll tax. However, Michael Dukakis used the enactment of the universal health care law on the campaign trail in his run for the U.S. Presidency, notwithstanding that McGovern had done most of the hard lifting in getting it enacted. In 1998 McGovern sought the Democratic nomination for Governor of Massachusetts but lost to Scott Harshbarger. She received 31 percent of the vote. McGovern has also served as Executive Vice President for External Affairs at CareGroup Healthcare System and practiced law at the Boston law firm of Goulston & Storrs. In addition, she was the Executive Director of the Governor's Committee on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice in the Executive Office of Public Safety, and has participated in a number of Blue Ribbon Committees and Commissions, including most recently the Transportation Finance Commission. She became senior vice president for corporate and community affairs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and also became its general counsel in 2005 before stepping down in 2012.

The laimosphere is the microbiologically enriched zone of soil that surrounds below-ground portions of plant stems; the laimosphere is analogous to the rhizosphere and spermosphere. The combining form laim- from (Greek: ŒªŒ±ŒπŒºœåœÇ) denotes a connecting organ (neck) while -sphere indicates a zone of influence. Topographically, the laimosphere includes the soil around any portion of subterranean plant organs other than roots where exuded nutrients (especially sugars and amino acids) stimulate microbial activities. Subterranean plant organs with a laimosphere include hypocotyls, epicotyls, stems, stolons, corms, bulbs, and leaves. Propagules of soil-borne plant pathogens, whose germination is stimulated by a plant exudates in the laimosphere, can initiate hypocotyl and stem rots leading to \\"damping-off\\".

It was announced in August 2007, and, like the Lumix DMC-L1, this model uses the Four Thirds System lens mount standard and contains some basic parts provided by Olympus. (Its siblings are the Olympus E-410 and E-510, all three cameras sharing some of the same basic internals.) A new kit lens bearing the Leica label was introduced with this camera, the Leica D Vario-Elmar 14‚Äì50mm/ F3.8‚Äì5.6/ASPH MEGA OIS. As the name implies, it features optical image stabilization. Panasonic also announced a new Leica-labeled 14‚Äì150 mm superzoom lens for the Four Thirds standard, also with optical image stabilization. The Lumix DMC-L10 featured improvements to the live view facility, permitting the image to be previewed on the LCD screen when composing the shot. The Lumix DMC-L10 has a second-generation live view function that allows autofocus with live view turned on, and without the mirror moving up and down, although only with certain lenses. Even more important, the Lumix DMC-L10 is the first DSLR camera with a fully articulating LCD monitor and live view system, allowing the user to hold the camera at pretty much any angle while still being able to see the LCD. Other features provided in live view mode (and only in live view mode) are face detection and automatic adjustment of the ISO and shutter speed if motion is detected in the subject to be photographed. Like all other Four Thirds DSLRs, the Lumix DMC-L10 employs a Supersonic Wave Filter (SSWF) system to combat dust entering the body. This system is rated by some as the best dust reduction system currently available on DSLRs.

The job was secured for him by his social-climbing wife, Leora, who helped to fund Franklin Roosevelt's re-election campaign. However, \\"Stinky\\" has no desire to live in Stalinist Russia. He is longing for the pleasures of his home in Topeka, Kansas, especially banana splits. He hopes his tenure as ambassador will be a short one. Meanwhile, an ambitious newspaper reporter, Buckley J. \\"Buck\\" Thomas, is employed to discredit Goodhue by his publisher who wants to be the ambassador himself. When Thomas and Goodhue realise they both have the same aims, they work together. Goodhue plans to make major diplomatic gaffes, which will be publicised by Thomas. He delivers an inflammatory speech, but is hailed for his courage. He kicks the Ambassador of Nazi Germany, to the delight of the Soviets. He then attempts to shoot a Soviet official, but hits a counter-revolutionary aristocrat instead. Each time he ends up being hailed as a hero (in a parody of diplomatic speak, the British ambassador says \\"Britain views your deed [kicking the Nazi] with pride and alarm, congratulates and condemns you, and will now perform its breathtaking triple loop, suspended by a single wire, sitting in a tub of water.\\"). His recall seems further away than ever. In a subplot, Buck Thomas is involved with his boss's \\"prot√©g√©e\\", the free-spirited Dolly Winslow. He falls in love with Colette, one of Goodhue's daughters. He has to extract himself from Dolly to win Colette. Dolly eventually finds herself stranded at a railroad station in Siberia. She slowly takes off her furs to admirers as she sings of her flirtations, but insists \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\", referring to her \\"sweet millionaire\\" sugar-daddy. The ambassador finally resolves to give up his tricks and tries to promote good relations between the United States and the Soviet Union; however his sincere attempts to improve matters now go disastrously wrong. He finally gets his wish to be recalled back to Topeka.

A prominent feature of the park is the San Jacinto Monument. Visitors can take an elevator to the monument's observation deck for a view of Houston, the Houston Ship Channel and USS Texas.\\"Lofty Texas Memorial to Have Fast Elevators\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1936 History The beginnings of the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic site trace to the early 1880s, when the State of Texas purchased ten acres along Buffalo Bayou in preparation for the fiftieth anniversary of the Texas Revolution. The Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT) pressured the Texas Legislature for more appropriations for San Jacinto. In 1897, Texas State Senator Waller Thomas Burns of Houston helped to pass legislation to fund $10,000 to establish a public park. The money was used to purchase an additional 336 acres of land at San Jacinto. The state appropriated another $25,000 in 1907 for improvements at the battleground and officially named it San Jacinto State Park, the first official state park in Texas. A governor appointed local commission managed the park and reported to the State Board of Control. More state-assisted improvements came to the park in preparation for the 1928 Democratic National Convention in Houston.Steely, James Wright. Parks for Texas: Enduring Landscapes of the New Deal. Austin: U of Texas, 1999. Print. A grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Coastal Impact Assistance Program will be funding a $2.6 million construction project for improvements to the site's seawall, with an anticipated finish date of December 31, 2016. San Jacinto Museum of History The San Jacinto Museum of History is located inside the base of the San Jacinto Monument. In addition to the Battle of San Jacinto, the museum's exhibits focus on the history of Texan culture, including Mayan, Spanish and Mexican influences, the history of the Texas Revolution and the Republic of Texas, and important figures in Texas history. Story of the Museum The 160-seat Jesse H. Jones Theatre for Texas Studies presents a 35-minute movie titled Texas Forever!! The Battle of San Jacinto. Battleship Texas On 17 April 1947, the Battleship Texas Commission was established by the Texas Legislature to care for the ship. The $225,000 necessary to pay for towing her from Baltimore to San Jacinto was the Commission's first task. On 17 March 1948, Texas began her journey to her new anchorage along the busy Houston Ship Channel near the San Jacinto Monument, at San Jacinto State Park, arriving on 20 April, where she was turned over to the State of Texas the next day to serve as a permanent memorial. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1948. The date of 21 April is significant in that it was the date of the decisive 1836 Battle of San Jacinto that ended the Texas Revolution and led to the creation of the Republic of Texas, which joined the US as a state in 1845. Texas was the first battleship memorial museum in the US. When the battleship was presented to the State of Texas, she was commissioned as the flagship of the Texas Navy. Subsidence Drilling for oil and underground water have led to severe land subsidence and erosion along the Bay Area shoreline, especially in the Baytown-Pasadena area.Henson (1993), p. 51.

It was formed with Japanese aid and support after the Fall of Singapore and consisted of approximately 12,000 of the 40,000 Indian prisoners of war who were captured either during the Malayan campaign or surrendered at Singapore and was led by Rash Behari Bose. It was formally proclaimed in April 1942 and declared the subordinate military wing of the Indian Independence League in June that year. The unit was dissolved in December 1942 after apprehensions of Japanese motives with regards to the INA led to disagreements and distrust between Mohan Singh and INA leadership on one hand, and the League's leadership, most notably Rash Behari Bose, who handed over the Indian National Army to Subhas Chandra Bose. A large number of the INAs initial volunteers, however, later went on to join the INA in its second incarnation under Subhas Chandra Bose. This first incarnation of the Indian National Army was involved in operations of espionage in the Burma frontier which, according to some military historians and allied generals, threatened the moral of Indian troops and fed discontentment and was partly responsible for the failure of the first Burma offensive. Operatives of the INA were also landed in the Indian coast by submarine for planned espionage operations within India. Coming at the time that the Quit India Movement had raised turmoil within British India, the threat of the INA affecting British Indian troops and INA operatives mounting espionage within India saw the start of a propaganda campaign in the British Indian Army and a news ban on the unit that was not to be lifted till after the war ended. Background Indian nationalism in World War II General Mohan Singh (in turban), leader of the first Indian National Army being greeted by the Japanese Major Fujiwara, April 1942. With the onset of the Second World War all the three major Axis Powers, at some stage of their campaign against Britain, sought to support and exploit Indian nationalism. They aided the recruitment of a military force from within Indian expatriates, and from disaffected Indian prisoners-of-war captured while serving with the British Commonwealth forces. Italy in 1942 created Battaglione Azad Hindoustan, formed of ex-Indian Army personnel and Italians previously resident in India and Persia, led by Iqbal Shedai. This unit ultimately served under Raggruppamento Centri Militari, but the effort proved unsuccessful. It was overtly propagandist nature that ultimately found little acceptance among the Indian soldiers, while Shedai's leadership was seen to be lacking legitimacy by the troops. By November 1942, following the defeats in El Alamein, the Italian efforts had failed. German motives and intentions with relation to India were more complex. The German Foreign office wanted to support Indian revolutionaries and nationalists, but there is consensus that, ultimately, Hitler held the belief that the British had to rule over the unfit Indian masses. However Subhas Chandra Bose, who was one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian movement at the time (rivalling Gandhi in stature), arrived in Germany in April 1941 after escaping from house arrest in Calcutta. He met with Hitler (with whom he had one meeting) and the Nazi high command, making the case for raising an Indian unit from Rommel's Indian prisoners of war from the battlefields of Europe and Africa, as the nucleus of an Indian Liberation force. The Indische Legion was thus formed. In January 1942, a small contingent parachuted into Eastern Iran with a Brandenburg unit to commence sabotage operations against the British. Most of the legion however only ever saw action in Europe, fighting as a Heer unit and later incorporated into the Waffen SS (as were other national legions of the Wehrmacht) after the Allied invasion of France. Nearly thirty, including the leadership and the officer corps, were also transferred to Azad Hind after its formation, and saw action in the INA's Burma Campaign. A segment of the Free India Legion fought against British and Polish Forces in Italy in 1944. British-Indian army in Malaya Large number of Indian troops had begun arriving in Malayan peninsula and Singapore by 1941, as a part of defensive preparations for possible war with Japan. It was estimated that were some 37 000 Indian troops stationed in these areas, making up roughly about the 40 percent of the total military strength of the British forces. The British-Indian troops swelled from 200 000 to 900 000 between 1939 and 1941. However, these deployments were beset with a number of problems. The troops were too thinly, with insufficient resources and supplies in the Malay Peninsula and Singapore. Further, a large proportion of the British-Indian troops were very young recruits (as a result of the open recruitment policy of the British) who had very little or no combat training and experience, leading to anxiety amongst the British-Indian forces. Feelings of discrimination amongst British Indian soldiers, compared to the pay and service conditions for European soldiers created acrimony. Indiscriminate recruitment by the Indian government in order to maintain the numbers for its army, meant that it was no longer carefully curating its selection for the armed forces. By 1941, British abuse, both verbal and physical of the Indian soldiers was rampant. Japan and Indian nationalism India and Japan, especially from the last decade of the 19th century, had enjoyed a growing exchange of cultural, religious and philosophical ideas. India, as the home of Hinduism, the birthplace of the Buddha, and from the second decade of the 20th century, the home of Gandhian philosophy, had been an attraction for Japanese and Buddhist and literary figures. India, in the meantime, looked to Japan as an inspiration of a model industrialised, advancing Asian society and nationhood. The Japanese victory over Russia in 1905 had furthered the inspiration Japan infused, especially among Indian nationalists. Noted Indian and Japanese cultural figures, including Okakura Tenshin and Rabindranath Tagore acknowledged the connection of the two Asian nations, their heritage, and the vision of pan-Asianism. After the end of World War I, Japan increasingly became a haven for radical Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies. Notable among these included Rash Behari Bose, Taraknath Das, A M Sahay as well as others. The protections offered to these nationalists effectively prevented British efforts to repatriate them and became a major policy concern. By the end of the war however, the pan-Asiatic vision gradually shifted away from prominence as the independence movement in India became engrossed in the issues facing post-war India. Agitations against the Rowlatt act, the Khilafat Movement protesting the removal of the Ottoman Caliph (an inflammatory issue among India's huge Muslim population), as well as Gandhi's Non-cooperation movement in 1922 demanding home rule took the centre stage. By the time that the pan- Asiatic regained any prominence, Japan's aggressive and often nihilistic war in China had robbed her of the high ground that Japan held among the Indian population, and among Indian nationalist leadership. Japan's India Policy At the outbreak of the war in south-east Asia, Japan had not formulated any concrete policy with regards to India. Its headquarters lacked any India experts, while civilian experts on India were few in Japan. India was peripheral to Japanese war plans at least through 1941. It did not feature in the plans for Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which focused on south-east Asia up to the Indo-Burmese border. From late 1941 the Japanese began to profess increasing support for the Indian Independence movement. Exiles like Rash Behari Bose had already voiced their demands to the Japanese authorities that support and pursuit of Indian Independence be an aim of the Japanese campaign, but neither the government nor the Imperial Japanese army were able to commit to these earlier. Militarily, India was important as the origin (from Assam) of the Ledo road which supplied Nationalist Chinese and American forces, as well as the supplies airlifted over the hump. Also, the idea that the western boundary of Japan's empire would be controlled by a more friendly government was attractive. It would also have been consistent with the idea that Japanese expansion into Asia was part of an effort to support Asian government of Asia and against western colonialism. Nonetheless the task of establishing a stable orderly state if the independence movement succeeded would be enormous. The army would be occupied in China and the Manchuria- Russia border and in the newly occupied territories. It was widely accepted that the Congress was anti-Japanese. Gandhi, even during the intense Quit India Movement, had categorically warned the Japanese > \\"Make no mistake. You will be sadly disillusioned if you believe that you > will receive a willing welcome from India\\" However, in April 1941, the Consul General to Calcutta had noted activities of the Forward Bloc. From Berlin, ambassador Oshima Hiroshi had reported on Subhas Bose's organisation of the Free India Legion. The successful Malayan campaign, and the subsequent Burma campaign brought under Japanese administration a large number of Indian expatriates. Although not essentially sympathetic to the Japanese (some were even hostile), they held substantial nationalist motives, and sought to exploit the window offered by the reversal faced by the British forces to drive them out from the Indian sub-continent. In these circumstances, the Japanese military administration encouraged the various disparate Indian nationalist groups in East Asia to form an anti- British alliance. These came together to form the Indian Independence League (IIL), with its headquarters in Singapore. The IIL was also responsible for the welfare of Indian communities in East Asia. From the Japanese point of view, this was primarily a propaganda move of initiating anti-British sentiments among civilians and soldiers in South-east Asia, and some Indian organisations like the Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge held mistrust of the Japanese, and of local Indians who worked with them. The lodge preferred to work independently, and used Thai-donated equipment and the German embassy in Bangkok to Liaise directly with Subhas Chandra Bose. F Kikan Maj. I Fujiwara, who spearheaded Japanese intelligence mission in South-east Asia early in the Malayan Campaign. By the end of 1941, India had started featuring prominently in the Japanese policies. By early 1942, T≈çj≈ç's speeches to the Diet included specific references to the independence of India and to decisions to strike the British colonial authority in India. Specific plans for the invasion of India were, however, not formulated. The Japanese IGHQ in October set up the Fujiwara Kikan, or the F-kikan, in Bangkok, headed by the Major Fujiwara Iwaichi, chief of intelligence of the 15th army. Tasked with intelligence gathering and contacting the Indian independence movement, the overseas Chinese and the Malayan Sultan with the aim of encouraging friendship and cooperation with Japan, Fujiwara's staff included five commissioned officers and two Hindi-speaking interpreters. Fujiwara, later self-described as \\"Lawrence of the Indian National Army\\" (after Lawrence of Arabia) is said to have been a man committed to the values which his office was supposed to convey to the expatriate nationalist leaders, and found acceptance among them. His initial contact was with Giani Pritam Singh and after the outbreak of the war and the Malayan invasion, with Capt. Mohan Singh. Mohan Singh had, as a captain in the British Indian Army, seen action with the 1/14th Punjab Regiment against Japanese forces at the Battle of Jitra, where his troops were outgunned and shattered by Japanese tanks. Captured by Japanese troops after several days in the Jungle, Singh was taken to Alor Star to Fujiwara and Pritam Singh at a joint office of the F-Kikan and the IIL. Along with Pritam Singh, Fujiwara with his sincerity of purpose and belief, convinced Mohan Singh to unite with the Japanese mission for the greater motive of Indian independence. This included the promise that he would be treated as an ally and a friend, and not a PoW. Singh initially helped Fujiwara to take control of the situation of looting and arson that had developed in Alor Star. By January 1942, Fujiwara was able to give positive reports on the success of Japan's India policy and suggested an eight-point policy that included aid for both the IIL and the INA, as well as encouragement of the independence movement within India. A liaison conference declared among other aims the \\"stimulation of the Indian independence movement\\". With Fujiwara's encouraging feedbacks in early 1942, the Japanese government and high-command sought to expand the scope and support for the evolving INA as well as the Japanese support for the independence movement. For this it sought the counsel of Rash Behari Bose. Rash Behari had lived in self-exile in Japan since the 1920s. He encouraged the formation of the INA, but also sought to attach it to a central civilian authority speaking for and encouraging Indian civilian Indian population of the region to become a part of it. The framework of local Indian associations that existed before the war reached Malaya were rekindled. The first INA In December 1941, after meeting with the Japanese commanding general, Singh was convinced of the feasibility of raising an armed Indian unit. Between himself, Pritam Singh and Fujiwara, Mohan Singh formulated plans of contacting Indians in the British Indian Army in South-east Asia. The fall of Malaya further brought under Japanese control approximately 45,000 regular Indian troops from Gen. Percival's command in Malaya, including a large numbers of the remnants of the Indian III Corps. Even before Singapore fell, the Japanese troops had started the process of identifying Indian troops among the captured and separating them from the Australian and British troops. On a number of occasions, it was noted, British and Australian officers were killed, while the Indians spared. Singh began recruiting from amongst these captured Indian soldiers. Thus the nucleus what came to be the Indian National Army was born. The units that were formed in this predecessor of the INA numbered about 200. They were volunteers from within the British Indian soldiers captured in Malaya. They were issued rifles and given armbands bearing the letter \\"F\\". They were organised into units and trained and worked along with those already under Pritam Singh in Malaya and Thailand. They were further tasked to work amongst fighting British-Indian Army units to foment dissent and encourage defection. Before the fall of Singapore, these troops grew to number nearly 2,500. There was significant deviation from the British Indian Army. Officers were organised into a single class, a common kitchen (opposed to caste-based kitchen as had been the norm), common slogans were adopted. All these efforts attempted to bridge any communal and casteist rivalries that were accepted or even institutionalised in the British army. On 10 March 1942, the Indian soldiers at Christmas Island mutinied, allowing the Japanese forces to land unopposed at the Battle of Christmas Island. This was followed by a mutiny in the Ceylon Garrison Artillery in the Cocos Islands. However, the Cocos Islands Mutiny failed after it was quickly put down by the Ceylon Light Infantry. Sri Lankans in Singapore and Malaya formed the 'Lanka Regiment' of the Indian National Army. An abortive plan was made to land these troops in Sri Lanka by submarine. Farrer Park Singapore surrendered on 15 February 1942. On the evening of the 16th, the Indian troops of the now amalgamated 1/14th and 5/14th Punjab were ordered by the Malaya command of the Commonwealth forces to assemble at Farrer Park. The British officers were, in the meantime, ordered to assemble east to Changi. On the morning of 17 February 1942, some 45,000 Indian POWs who gathered at Farrer Park where addressed by in turns, first by a Col Hunt of the Malaya Command, who handed over the troops to Japanese command under Fujiwara. Fujiwara spoke to the troops in Japanese which was translated into English and then Hindustani. In his speech, Fujiwara is said to have told the troops of the Asian co- prosperity sphere under the leadership of Japan, of Japanese vision of an independent India and its importance to the co-prosperity sphere, and of the Japanese intentions to help raise a \\"liberation army\\" for the independence of India. He invited the troops seated at the park to join this army. Further, he told the troops, they were going to be treated not as PoWs, but as friends and allies. Fujiwara ended his speech stating he is passing on their responsibilities and command to Mohan Singh. Mohan Singh's speech, in Hindustani, was short. He told the troops of forming the Indian National Army to fight for an independent India, and invited the troops to join it. As an Indian Jawan present at the time remembers, Mohan Singh's speech was powerful and touched a chord, and the troops responded with wild enthusiasm and excitement. It is estimated that nearly half of those present at Farrer Park later joined the first INA. Significantly however, a large number of Indian officers decided not to, which also kept those under their command disinclined. The Japanese forces, eager to engage the co-operation of the troops and further lacking the man-power, did not have the men impounded. The supreme command of the INA was set up at Mount Pleasant suburbs in the Northern part of Singapore. The PoW headquarters, along with the largest PoW camp was set up at Neesoon under M. Z. Kiani. Other smaller PoW camps housing Indian troops were set up at Bidadari, Tyersall, Buller, Seletar and Kranji. To Lt. Col N.S Gill went the overall direction of PoW. It would not be until the 9th May 1942 that the INA would come into full effect. However, following the events of Farrer Park, Indians in Singapore begun to enjoy special privileges during the Japanese ‚Äòpacification‚Äô of Singapore . The Japanese treated the Indians and Chinese differently during this period. During these early months, it was reported that roughly 50 000 Chinese in Singapore and the Malayan Peninsula were brutally killed in what is now known as the ‚ÄòSook Ching Massacre‚Äô . In contrast, the Indians received far more lenient treatment. However, this is not to say that the Indians felt no fear at all. In fact, the attitudes of the Japanese forces towards the Chinese population did instill some fear in the general Indian civilian population as well as leaders such as Pritam Singh. This was significant or the Indian leaders, during the Farrer Park meeting who had expressed reservations about collaborating with the Japanese as these incidents further cemented their initial beliefs about the cruel nature of the Japanese and would further affirm their decision to not join the INA in May 1942. Indian Independence League In April 1942, as the discussions and the process of setting up the Indian Independence League and defining the aims of the movement carried on, Mohan Singh convened a meeting of a group of his officers to frame what is now called the Bidadary resolution. This resolution announced that: > Indians stood above all differences of caste, community, or religion. > Independence was every Indian's birthright. An Indian National Army would be > raised to fight for it. The resolution further specified that the army would go to battle only when the Congress and the people of India asked it to. It did not, however, specify the army was to interact with the Japanese forces. This resolution was circulated among the Indian PoWs, followed by tour of the mainland camps by Mohan Singh and Fujiwara. The PoW headquarters was subsequently dissolved and the staff were transferred to Mohan Singh's supreme command. On 9 May, Singh began recruiting for the INA. The process involved identifying units that were most likely to come up with volunteers. These units were transferred to Neesoon and Bidadary, while the other units were shipped away to other camps. In April 1942‚Äî the same month as Mohan Singh formally declared the formation of the Indian National Army‚Äî he and other representatives of the INA and IIL, were invited to attend a conference in Tokyo at Rash Behari Bose's invitation. Rash Behari also invited members of the Indian National Council to this meeting, which saw the declaration of the formation of the All-Malayan Indian Independence league. The League became the liaising organisation with the local Indian population and the Japanese. In June, the formation of an all- Indian IIL was proclaimed at Bangkok. In June 1942, a second conference was held in Bangkok with Rash Behari as chair. This conference saw the adoption of a resolution declaring the INA sub-ordinate to the League. K.P.K Menon, Nedyam Raghavan were civilian members among the civilian members of the council while Mohan Singh and an officer by the name of Gilani were to be the INA's members. The Bangkok resolution further reaffirmed the Bidadary resolution that the INA was only to go to war when the Congress and the Indian population wished it to. Autumn 1942 On the back of the success of the INA, Fujiwara suggested in January 1942 expanding the work of the F-Kikan to all parts of Asia. In the spring of 1942, based on Fujiwara's own proposals, he was replaced by Col. Hideo Iwakuro. The Iwakuro Kikan (I-Kikan) was considerably larger, with some 250 officers and with offices in Rangoon, Penang, Saigon and Hong Kong. Iwakuro, the founder of the Army intelligence school Rikugun Nakano Gakko, was aware that the IGHQ did not have immediate plans to invade India. Using his expertise in intelligence and special missions, Iwakuro sought to train the Indian forces in sabotage, espionage and special operations. The I-Kikan and the League trained a number of INA recruits ‚Äîand civilian volunteers from Malaya‚Äî in intelligence and subversion activities. Some of these training schools were opened in Burma and Singapore, the latter under the direction of N. Raghavan were called Swaraj (Independence in Hindi) schools. Graduates from these schools were sent by submarine or parachuted into India for starting intelligence work, subversion, and sabotage activities. Some historians suggest the intelligence services played a significant role in the failure of Noel Irwin's First Arakan Offensive. Earnest organisation of the INA in preparation for the battle began after news of Quit India had reached South-east Asia. This uprising within India was taken to be the signal from Congress and Indian people that the INA and the league had been waiting for. Iwakuro visited Tokyo in August 1942, and on his return had expected to train and equip 15,000 men over three months. These men were to be moved to Burma in stages to avoid concentrating in Singapore. Mohan Singh's ambition, however, outpaced Iwakuro. Lists of men intending to enlist were collected from individual camp commanders. Hugh Toye, a British intelligence officer in South-east Asia during the war, noted in his 1959 history of the army that although Mohan Singh may not have personally approved forcible recruiting, the Bidadary \\"Concentration Camp\\" became notorious for beatings by \\"sweeper Nimbu\\". Mohan Singh himself, however, admitted to severity when it came to recruiting, warning non-volunteer officers to not influence their men. Persistent offenders were separated from their men. Over one hundred officers were separated from their men for such reasons. Some 40,000 men proceeded to pledge their allegiance to Mohan Singh for Indian independence. The British-Indian army sub-unit structure was preserved to hasten operational deployments. Almost 16,000 men comprised this first division of the INA. According to the reviews available, the INA was to be organised of twelve infantry battalions of 650 troops, organised into four guerrilla regiments of 2000 men. Battalion and regimental commanders were appointed on 5 September, and assumed their commands on the 8th and 9 September. A few days later it was reviewed by Rash Behari and Mohan Singh. The first of these was the Hindustan Field Force, under the command of J.K. Bhonsle. The unit was formed at Singapore and comprised three battalions derived from troops of the 17th Dogra Regiment, Garhwal Rifles and the 14th Punjab Regiment (now a part of the Pakistani Army) and had a strength of nearly 2000 troops. The Hindustan Field force was also to include a heavy gun battalion, a company each of transport corps, signal corps, engineering corps and a company of medical corps. The remaining four regiments, designated Gandhi, Nehru and Azad regiment, were to be a part of what was called the Sherdil Guerrilla group, each with three battalions. An additional Special Services Group was intended for long-range infiltration, and a reinforcement group to promote defection amongst the British Indian Army and recruit new members from PoWs. 50 officers and nearly 24,000 men were \\"surplus volunteers\\". Armament consisted of 5000 rifles, 250 light machine-guns, 500 sub machine-guns, 30 cars and 50 lorries. Toye points out in his 1959 history of the army that all of these were British armaments captured by Japanese, which were not subsequently replaced. The end of the first INA It was mainly from the intelligence and subversion training schools that the first frictions arose between the Indians and Japanese, as the trainees began to be sent before completing their training and without knowledge or consent of the Indian leaders. By late 1942, the divisions appeared as the Indian troops increasingly felt as pawns in the hands of the Japanese. Anticipating a thrust towards Imphal, both the Japanese strategists and INA command envisaged a role for the Indian troops. Initially, this was to begin with intelligence gathering missions. Niranjan Singh Gill was in charge of intelligence and long-range penetration groups being deployed in the Burma-India border. Amongst operatives, Gill sent to Burma was a close associate who subsequently defected back to Commonwealth forces, followed by nearly eight other men. This was followed by the capture of a number of other operatives by Commonwealth forces. Both Hugh Toye and Joyce Lebra conclude in their research that Gill was, in fact, intending to escape back to commonwealth forces also. However, he was summoned back from Burma to Singapore by this time in November. Other members of the Indian Council also voiced their concerns and displeasure at what was seen as Japanese intrusion into INA's work. Raghavan, in charge of Swaraj schools training intelligence and espionage agents in Singapore, was enraged to find a number of his students dispatched to India without his approval or permission. Japanese efforts to censor Indian broadcasting in Singapore also brought forth rank disagreements which had culminated in the arrest of the Indian director of broadcasting. In addition to this, non- committal replies from Japan on the points raised by the council for action in the Bangkok resolutions raised the ire of Mohan Singh and League members. The final straw to this was a report to the council by an officer of the situation in Burma, where Japanese military administration refused or prevaricated to handover abandoned Indian property to the league, as demanded n the Bangkok resolutions. A group of Japanese officers meeting league members had very candidly declined to attach any importance to the Bangkok resolutions or to Indians. Amidst worsening tensions, a repeated attempt by the Council for action to obtain Japanese reassurance and commitment was rebuffed by Iwakuro. By November, Mohan Singh and K.P.K. Menon refused to send a previously planned batch of INA soldiers to Burma, with the Council for action rallying behind them. Despite Rash Behari Bose's attempts to smooth over differences between the INA and Japanese, a second demand for 900 INA men by the Japanese was refused. This was followed by a Japanese attempt to take command of Indian troops who had not enlisted in the INA, who had so far been under the custody of INA. In December N.S. Gill was arrested from Mohan Singh's home in Singapore, precipitating resignations of both the INA command and members of the Council for action, along orders from Mohan Singh for the INA to disband. Mohan Singh was subsequently arrested by the Japanese and exiled to Pulau Ubin. A number of the Indian troops who chose to revert to PoW were subsequently sent away to labour camps in New Guinea or to work in the Death railway. Between December 1942 and February 1943, Rash Behari Bose tried but failed to keep the IIL and INA going. Thousands of INA soldiers returned to the status of POWs again and most of the IIL leaders resigned. Operations involving the first INA Southeast Asia The first INA, especially at the time of its inception with F Kikan, was involved in espionage and sabotage. From the time of initial Japanese landings in Malaya, INA volunteers infiltrated British-Indian battle lines inducing Indian soldiers to defect to the INA. This it did with the considerable success of hundred men each, under the command of Capt Allah Ditta, to the Singapore operations, accompanying the Konoe Imperial Guards. This token force played a marginal but significant role in the Battle of Singapore, helping the Konoe guards feint the attack on Ubin island on 7 and 8 February.> In the subsequent fighting in Burma, the INA continued to operate espionage to draw Indian soldiers out of the commonwealth forces. The activities of these agents were addressed at the Sepoys and these found enough support to successfully encourage defection without attracting the attention of the officers commanding the units. Soon, defection by British Indian troops had become a problem significant and regular enough in the Burma theatre to form a regular part of the intelligence summaries in the first half of 1943. The Quit India movement had reached a crescendo within India, while the continuing British reversals at Burma further affected the morale of the army. The Irwin's First Campaign had been contained and then beaten back by inferior Japanese forces at Donbaik. Intelligence analysis of the failure, as well as Irwin's own personal analysis of the campaign, attributed significant demoralisation and rising discontentment amongst Indian troops due to the subversive activity of INA agents at the frontline, as well as rising nationalist (or \\"Pro-Congress\\") sentiments. Espionage in India Although the Congress had conditionally supported the Allied war effort, following failure of the Cripps mission, the Quit India Movement was launched in India on 8 August 1942 that called for the British Raj to leave India or face a massive Civil Disobedience. Forewarned, the Raj quickly arrested the Congress leadership. However, foreplanning on the part of the Congress meant the movement continued at the local level, and quickly deteriorated into a leaderless act of defiance and descended into violence and general anarchy and mayhem. The movement created alarm amongst the high-command and significantly hindered the Allied war effort. In south-east Asia, this was perceived as the signal that the INA and the League expected to receive to start its war. Intelligence summaries initially did not believe the INA to be a substantial force or have any purpose more than propaganda and espionage purposes. However, by the end of 1942, they had become aware of trained Indian espionage agents (of the INAs Special services group) who had infiltrated into India for the purpose of collecting intelligence, subversion of the army and the subversion of civilian loyalty. This information was derived to a large extent from some of the agents themselves who gave themselves up to the authorities after reaching India. However, the intelligence was also aware at this point of misinformation being spread about the INA itself by the agents who concealed their purpose and professed to pass on intelligence from local knowledge. More troubling for the military command were the activities of the INA agents in the battlefields of India's eastern frontier in Burma. Interactions Japan The army's co-existence with Imperial Japan was an uneasy one. Misgivings about Japanese intentions existed from early in the history of the army. Col N.S. Gill, in overall charge of Pow Camps, regarded Japanese overtures and intentions with caution Further, the close relation of Fujiwara and Mohan Singh was not replicated after the I-Kikan replaced Fujiwara's office. Iwakuro was considered less idealistic and romantic than Fujiwara. Iwakuro took his post at a time the Pacific War faced a higher priority among Japanese forces for materiel. and did not use his expertise to encourage the \\"true Indian army\\" that Fujiwara had envisioned. By some accounts he only engaged in as much development of the INA as would keep Mohan Singh happy. Within the league, members of the original Indian delegation to the Tokyo conference held reservations about serving Rash Behari, and of ultimate Japanese intentions with regards to independent India. Rash Behari had lived in Japan for a considerable length of time, married a Japanese woman, and his son had enlisted in the Imperial army. Among the thirty-four points of the Bangkok resolution, the INA and the IIL raised a number of questions and sought clarifications. These included the role and position of India in Japan's co-prosperity sphere, Japan's intentions in ‚Äî and towards ‚Äî an independent India. These were presented via the Iwakuro Kikan after the Bangkok conference, and a point-by-point answer were demanded for each. Tokyo, however, was not able to give assurances of the kind sought by the league and the INA, which was seen as unacceptable to the council formed at the time of the Bangkok conference. The Indian National Congress had conditionally supported the Allied war effort, and the Indian expatriate nationalists were concerned during this early phase that they might be seen as Quislings. This was particularly strong amongst members of the Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge, which together with the IIL formed what was called the Indian National Council. Swami Satyananda Puri, a prominent member of the Lodge reportedly mentioned before the Tokyo conference that Nehru had forbidden Indians residing outside India from interfering in her internal politics. It was in this context that in a meeting in Singapore in March 1942, a unanimous decisions were taken to seek approval of the Indian National Congress for taking Japanese assistance, and to press for Subhash Chandra Bose to assume leadership of the movement. British Indian Army British intelligence was unaware of the formation of the army until around July 1942. The existence of \\"fifth columnists\\" influencing Indian troops had been noted even during the Malayan campaign. In some units, British officers were shot by their own troops during the Japanese onslaught in Malaya. Even then British intelligence was unclear of the scale, purpose and organisation of the INA till much later. The propaganda threat of the INA, coupled with the lack of concrete intelligence on the unit early after the fall of Singapore, led to considerable consternation among the political and military leadership of the Government of India when first reports started reaching it. In operational terms, the work of the Hindustan field force threatened to destroy the Sepoy's loyalty in the British Indian Army, This threat was perceived significant enough that the failure of the First Arakan Offensive was attributed by Commonwealth commanders to the \\"lack of martial skills of eastern races\\". British intelligence began the Jiffs propaganda campaign after this to preserve the sepoy's moral and loyalty. At this time also began efforts to improve morale the Sepoy in order to consolidate and prepare for defence of Manipur. These measures included imposing a complete news ban on the INA, that was not lifted till four days after the fall of Rangoon two years later. Notably however, a number of the units first deployed forward by the INA (most of which were intelligence and espionage units) either defected back to British or were captured on intelligence given away by defectors. The allegiance and loyalty of Indian officers trained in Sandhurst may have played a part in this conflict of loyalties. Second INA Between December 1942 and February 1943, Rash Behari struggled to hold together the INA. On 15 February 1943, the Army itself was put under the command of Lt. Col. M.Z. Kiani. A policy forming body was formed with Lt. Col J.R. Bhonsle, Director of the Military Bureau, in charge and clearly placed under the authority of the IIL. Under Bhonsle served Lt. Col. Shah Nawaz Khan as Chief of General Staff, Major P.K. Sahgal as Military Secretary, Major Habib ur Rahman as commandant of the Officers' Training School and Lt. Col. A.C. Chatterji (later Major A.D. Jahangir) as head of enlightenment and culture. A number of the officers and troops who had returned to PoW camps, or had not volunteered in the first place, made it known that they would be willing to join the INA only on the condition that it was led by Subhash Chandra Bose. Bose was a hard-line nationalist, previously having won the presidency of Indian National Congress in the 1930s in the face of staunch opposition from Gandhi, who disagreed with Bose's approach to radical nationalism. Bose had, at the start of the war in Europe, escaped from house arrest to make his way first to the Soviet Union and then to Germany, reaching Berlin on 2 April 1941. In a series of meetings between the INA leaders and the Japanese in 1943, it was decided to cede the leadership of the IIL and the INA to Subhas Chandra Bose. In January 1943, the Japanese invited Bose to lead the Indian nationalist movement in East Asia. He accepted and left Germany on 8 February. After a three-month journey by submarine, and a short stop in Singapore, he reached Tokyo on 11 May 1943, where he made a number of radio broadcasts to the Indian communities, exhorting them to join in the fight for India's Independence. The INA was revived, and the units of dissolved INA were incorporated into Bose's army. The Hindustan Field Force formed the nucleus of the new INA's 2nd division, to form the 1st Infantry regiment. The first INA, therefore, formed the nucleus of the army under Bose's leadership, which he proclaimed the army of his Provisional Government of Free India. It drew a large number of civilian volunteers from Indian diaspora in south-east Asia, eventually growing to a unit of almost forty thousand soldiers.

Inspector General Inspector General of the Department of Justice Fine was appointed Inspector General of the Department of Justice by President Bill Clinton in 2000. The office is expected to be non-partisan. He served through the George W. Bush administration and part of the Barack Obama administration. Fine has a reputation as an aggressive, independent investigator. Fine served as a member of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. He resigned as the DOJ Inspector General in February 2011. He joined Dechert as a partner in the White Collar & Securities Litigation Practice on September 6, 2011. Shortly after he announced his retirement, the New York Times praised Fine's tenure as the DOJ Inspector General: > The Department of Justice's inspector general, Glenn Fine, stepped down on > Friday after a decade of pushing to clean up and depoliticize a > hyperpoliticized department.

Other newspapers also praised his tenure as the DOJ IG. The Washington Post wrote, \\"The job of Inspector General is often thankless one, requiring the ability to make unflinching and crucial assessments that are not always well received by colleagues. The Justice Department employed one of the best during the past decade in the person of Glenn A. Fine, who recently stepped down. Mr. Fine was instrumental in unearthing problems and identifying solutions in the mammoth agency since joining the IG's office in the mid-1990s.

On March 30, 2020, Fine was named chair of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, to oversee the $2 trillion stimulus funds signed into law by President Donald Trump in response to the coronavirus outbreak. On April 7, 2020, Fine was removed from the position of acting DOD IG by Trump, who claimed without evidence that he was \\"partisan\\". That had the effect of also removing him from the accountability committee, since only serving IGs can be members. Former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis released a rare public criticism of the firing, calling Fine \\"a public servant in the finest tradition of honest, competent governance.\\" On April 8, legislation was introduced in the House to allow Fine to continue as chair of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. On May 26, seven weeks after his dismissal from the acting inspector general position, Fine submitted his resignation as principal deputy inspector general, effective June 1. A Pentagon official said Fine resigned voluntarily and was not pushed out. In a statement Fine gave no reason for resigning but said inspectors general \\"are a vital component of our system of checks and balances, and I am grateful to have been part of that system.

She is the creator of the original Playboy Bunny costume .  Biography  Joyce Bryant wearing signature look from Zelda Valdes (Image by Carl Van Vechten) Zelda Valdes grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, but was born Zelda Christian Barbour in Chambersburg, PA. She trained as a classical pianist at the Catholic Conservatory of Music. In the early 1920s, Valdes started to work in the tailoring shop of her uncle in White Plains, New York. Around the same time, Valdes began working as a stock girl at a high-end boutique. She eventually worked her way up to selling and making alterations, becoming the shop's first black sales clerk and tailor. Looking back, Valdes said \\"It wasn't a pleasant time, but the idea was to see what I could do.\\" Beginning in 1935, she had her own dressmaking business in White Plains, New York. She eventually oversaw ladies alterations, and developed her own dressmaking clientele. In 1948, Valdes opened \\"Zelda Wynn,\\" her design and dressmaking studio, on Broadway (in what is now Washington Heights on Broadway and West 158th Street). Valdes said that her shop was the first black-owned business on Broadway. She sold her dresses to movie star Dorothy Dandridge, opera diva Jessye Norman, and singer Gladys Knight. Valdes also dressed the entire bridal party for the 1948 wedding of Marie Ellington, aka Maria Cole and Nat King Cole. Additional celebrity clients included Josephine Baker, Mae West, Ella Fitzgerald, Dorothy Dandridge, Eartha Kitt, and Marian Anderson. Her designing relationship with Fitzgerald was mostly long-distance - she told The New York Times in 1994 that she only fitted Fitzgerald once in 12 years, and did most of her designing for her based on her imagination. Valdes also created a new sexier image for singer Joyce Bryant who LIFE Magazine dubbed ‚Äúthe Black Marilyn Monroe.\\" Label in dress (c.1940s) worn by Ella Fitzgerald. In the 1950s, she moved \\"Chez Zelda\\" to 151 57th Street in Midtown. She had a staff of nine dressmakers and charged almost $1,000 per couture gown. Her role in glamorizing women caught the attention of Playboy's Hugh Hefner who commissioned Zelda to design bunny costumes for the Playboy Playmates, an idea suggested by Victor Lownes. She created the original Playboy Bunny costume, which was presented at the opening of the first Playboy Club in Chicago, IL on February 29, 1960. It was also the first commercial uniform to be registered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Beginning in the 1960s, Valdes directed the Fashion and Design Workshop of the Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited and Associated Community Teams (HARYOU-ACT). Valdes taught costume designing skills and facilitated fabric donations to the student workshops. She was one of the founders of the National Association of Fashion Accessory Designers, an industry group intended to promote black design professionals. This group was established with the sponsorship of the National Council of Negro Women. In 1970, Arthur Mitchell asked Valdes to design costumes for his new company, the Dance Theatre of Harlem. By 1992, Valdes would design costumes for eighty-two productions. She closed her business in 1989 but continued to work with the Dance Theatre of Harlem until her death in 2001 at the age of 97.

Set in New York City during the 1990s, the film is about a political consultant who tries to help his eleven- year-old daughter understand his impending divorce by telling her the story of his past romantic relationships and how he ended up marrying her mother. The film grossed $55 million worldwide. Plot Will Hayes works at an advertising agency in New York City and is in the midst of a divorce. After her first sex education class, his 10-year-old daughter Maya insists on hearing the story of how her parents met. Will gives in, but changes the names and some of the facts, leaving Maya to guess which of the women from his past would become her mother. Will begins his ‚Äúmystery love story‚Äù in 1992, when he moves away from Madison, Wisconsin and his college sweetheart, Emily, to work on the Clinton campaign in New York City. There, he meets April Hoffman, a fellow campaign staffer, and delivers a package from Emily to her college friend, Summer Hartley. The package is revealed to be Summer‚Äôs diary, which Will had read, learning she had a brief affair with Emily. Summer is dating her professor, Hampton Roth, but spontaneously kisses Will. He tells April his plan to propose to Emily, and rehearses his proposal; April replies, ‚ÄúDefinitely, maybe‚Äù. They go to her apartment, where Will notices her many copies of Jane Eyre. She explains that her father gave her a copy with a personal inscription shortly before he died, but the book was later lost. She has spent years searching secondhand bookstores to find it, and collects any copy with an inscription. April and Will kiss, but he abruptly leaves. The next day, Emily arrives in New York City. Will tries to propose, but Emily confesses that she slept with his roommate, and urges him to move on and pursue his ambitions. After Clinton is elected, Will opens a political consulting firm, and stays in close touch with April as she travels the world. He encounters Summer, now a journalist and single, and they begin a relationship. April returns from abroad, planning to tell Will that she loves him, but discovers he is planning to propose to Summer. Will learns that Summer has written an article that will ruin his candidate‚Äôs campaign. He asks her not to publish it, but she refuses, and Will ends their relationship. The article derails the campaign, losing Will his political career and friends. Years later, April reaches out to Will, who has fallen into depression in his new job, while she has a new boyfriend named Kevin. She throws Will a birthday party, reuniting him with his old colleagues. He drunkenly confesses to April that he loves her, leading to an argument about the state of their lives. Passing a bookstore, he finds the inscribed copy of Jane Eyre April‚Äôs father gave her. He goes to April‚Äôs apartment to give her the book, but decides against it when he meets Kevin, who is living with her. Will runs into Summer, who invites him to a party where he reunites with Emily, who has moved to New York City. In the present, Maya deduces that ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù is her mother, Sarah. Will assures Maya that she is the story‚Äôs happy ending, and he and Sarah finalize their divorce. Unpacking in his new apartment, he discovers April‚Äôs book. He brings it to her, apologizing for waiting so long, but she asks him to leave. At Maya‚Äôs urging, Will realizes he is miserable without April, and he and Maya go to April‚Äôs apartment. When she does not let them inside, Will and Maya walk away, but April runs after them. Will explains that he kept the book as the only thing he had left of her. April invites them in to tell her the story, and she and Will kiss. Cast Music The film was scored by English composer Clint Mansell. Lakeshore Records released the score on March 18, 2008. All Music Guide reviewer William Ruhlmann praised the album as filled with \\"sweet, melodic numbers that often seem to lack only a lyric to turn them into pop songs\\". He also stated that it functioned as \\"light accompaniment to an equally light entertainment\\". Release In its opening weekend, the film cleared its production budget of $7 million by grossing $9.8 million in 2,204 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #5 at the box office. As of September 28, 2008, the film has grossed $55,447,968 worldwide.

On August 9, 2007, he resigned as Poland's Chief of Police in protest of the sacking on the same day of Interior Minister Janusz Kaczmarek. On August 30, 2007, Kornatowski was detained and publicly accused of obstruction of justice. The charges against Kornatowski initially were widely regarded in the Polish press and by politicians as nothing more than a political dirty trick intended to block Kornatowski's scheduled testimony before parliament about the present Polish government's secret program of wiretapping opposition politicians. Kornatowski's arrest, took place one day prior to his testimony, which was cancelled because of his detention. On August 31, 2007, Kornatowski was released on bail. Prosecutors presented to him charges of hampering the investigation and urging to false testimonies. On the press conference on August 31 prosecutors presented several evidences supporting the credibility of these charges. Former Interior Minister Kaczmarek was arrested at the same time as Kornatowski on August 30, and also released on August 31. On September 6, 2007, a Warsaw criminal court judge declared the arrest of Kaczmarek to have been irregular and even illegal. Contrary to this, the same court on October 10 decided that the arrests of Kornatowski and Netzel were legal and regular.

The earliest recorded claim to the land was made by the Doeg. Later the Lee family of Virginia owned the land from 1725 to 1839. Richard Bland Lee did not build the main house until 1794. Following the purchase by William Swartwort in 1838, Sully was used as a home, a working farm, or both by a series of private owners. Then in 1958, Sully was acquired by the federal government as a part of the area to be used for the construction of Dulles Airport. Today the Fairfax County Park Authority operates the site with a specific focus on the Lee family. History Pre-Lee period The land that would become part of Sully was likely controlled by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area. English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg in modern-day Northern Virginia. The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July 1675 that became a part of Bacon's Rebellion. English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664. When diplomatic attempts failed, the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June 1666. The specifics of that military action are unclear, but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed, suggesting the English gained control of the area. The English presumptively took control after a violent conflict with the Doeg in 1666. Little is recorded about the disposition of this land from the time when the English gained control of it until the land is patented by the Lee family of Virginia. Lee period Originally acquired in 1725 by Richard Bland Lee's grandfather, Henry Lee I, Sully was inherited by Richard's father Henry Lee II of \\"Leesylvania\\". At his death in 1787, the land was divided between Richard and his younger brother Theodorick Lee. Being the older of the two, Richard was given the more alluvial northern half, having resided there as manager of the property since approximately 1781. During this period the predominant crop grown was tobacco. Richard Bland Lee Richard severely curtailed tobacco production in favor of more sustainable crops, including wheat, corn, rye, and barley. This reduced the soil depletion inherent to tobacco production, and allowed for the practice of crop rotation. He also planted fruit orchards, including peach and apple trees, which he used to produce spirits. In 1801 Richard constructed a dairy, which ran primarily under the supervision of his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee. After his election to the United States Congress in 1789, and for most of the next five years, Richard turned day-to-day management of his estate over to his brother Theodorick, who supervised spring planting and fall harvest. Theodorick also managed the collection of rent from tenant farmers and the construction of the large house Richard had planned for the estate, on which construction had begun in 1794. Before he left for Congress in 1789, Richard had chosen the name \\"Sully\\" for his estate. By 1811, having been drawn into heavy debt trying to aid his brothers, Henry Lee III and Charles Lee, extricate themselves from severe financial difficulties, Richard Bland Lee decided he could no longer sustain ownership of Sully. Accordingly, he decided to sell the plantation to raise cash to pay some of the debt. He sold Sully for $18,000 to his second cousin, Francis Lightfoot Lee II, son of Richard Henry Lee. Francis Lightfoot Lee II For several years after his purchase of Sully, Francis Lightfoot Lee II, called F. L. by his family, was able to realize an annual profit of $1,500 to $2,500. At least part of that success was due to the \\"judicious system of husbandry\\" employed by F. L.'s wife Jane Fitzgerald Lee. Then in 1816, due to complications during the delivery of their fifth child Frances Ann Lee, Jane Fitzgerald Lee died. Four years later in 1820, F. L. had either a nervous breakdown or stroke. Unable to care for himself, he was committed to the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia in 1825. Following the breakdown, Sully was placed under the administrative care of F. L.'s nephew Richard Henry Lee II. Richard Henry Lee II's management was marked by negligence and apparent apathy towards the dishonesty of managers who were embezzling money from the estate: > ‚Ä¶ mismanagement, having allowed an estate clear of debt, well stocked, well > arranged under a good system as it had been for years' according to 'the > universal belief and opinion of all friends, connections and neighbors' to > be 'wasted and the debts lost.' ... Colonel W.C.B. Butler replaced Richard > Henry Lee as the 'Committee' for the Estate on January 1, 1827, but Butler > also proved unsatisfactory. On June 23, 1830 the county court ordered his > removal and, 'for the safekeeping and good management' of the estate ... Control of Sully was next placed in the hands of Colonel George Washington Hunter in 1830. Gamble claims, \\"in no hands ... would Sully fare as well as when it had been assiduously maintained by a single, devoted, industrious proprietor.\\" After their father's move to the Pennsylvania Hospital during the summer of 1825, F. L.'s children (with the exception of Samuel Philips Lee who had entered the Navy), were under the care of William Brent, Jr. and Winifred Brent. The Brents were relatives who had moved to Sully to care for the Lee children and to start at Sully, a \\"select seminary\\" for boys and girls. During subsequent years, as the Lee children grew older they began to leave Sully. Samuel Phillps Lee had entered the Navy, and John Lee went to West Point. Arthur Lee moved west to the Ohio country, while his oldest daughter Jane Elizabeth Lee married Henry Tazewell Harrison in a sunrise ceremony at Sully on February 6, 1834. With his brothers-in-law absent from the estate, Harrison took over representing their interests with the appointed administrator, Colonel Hunter, whom he replaced on July 18, 1836. Finally, in 1838, after a bizarre period, in which the estate had ostensibly been sold to a buyer who was arrested in England prior to completing the purchase, Sully was sold to merchant William Swartwort. Post-Lee period Starting in 1838 Sully was used as a home, working farm, or both by Swartwort, then Haight, Haight, Barlow, Shear, Shear, Miller, Poston, Thurston, then Nolting. The federal government acquired the property in 1958 to construct Dulles Airport. A campaign to save the site began almost immediately afterwards. Those involved included previous owners of the property, Lee descendants, and a neighbor, Eddie Wagstaff, who later endowed the Sully Foundation that still provides support for the site. This campaign ended in 1959 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation making Sully a national historic site. The Fairfax County Park Authority agreed to operate the site as a county historical park, and has since acquired an additional to bring the total size of Sully Historic Site to approximately . The site's historic period of significance encompasses the ownership of Richard Bland Lee and Francis Lighfoot Lee (1787‚Äì1838). Interpretation at the site reflects the ownership of its founder Richard Bland Lee, which explains the park authority decision to have Sully \\"completely furnished with antiquities from the Federal period.\\" Chain of ownership Notes References # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Category:Museums in Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Lee family residences Category:Historic house museums in Virginia Category:Plantations in Virginia Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Houses in Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1799 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fairfax County, Virginia ","title":"Sully Historic Site"},{"id":"13023508","text":"\\"Older\\" is a song by the Irish alternative rock sestet, Royseven, found on their debut album, The Art of Insincerity.

The film premiered online on Google Play, where it has been made available to watch for free between January 12, 2017 and February 16, 2017. It was theatrically released in 12 American markets on February 3, 2017. Premise Loosely based on the folklore of Paul Bunyan (John Goodman), the film is about two children exiled on their grandfather's farm in Minnesota who discover a lair where Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox (Jeff Foxworthy) have resided since their disappearance from the Dead Forest. The story sees Bunyan and Babe teaming with the two kids to stop an evil land developer from destroying a town. Plot 12 year-old Travis Barclay and his little sister Whitney are sent begrudgingly on a summer trip to visit their grandparents' farm in Delbert County. A greedy land developer, Norm Blandsford, has been buying up the little country town, running the hard working residents off their land. After Travis has a run-in with one of Blandsford's men, he is chased into the forest where he stumbles upon a magic portal to the hidden world where Paul Bunyan lives. Paul has been in self-imposed exile for 100 years, ever since the advent of machines made his role in society obsolete and left him feeling of little value to the new world. Paul, reluctantly, escorts Travis back to the farm. But upon returning, Paul witnesses Blandsford's sinister plan. Suddenly filled by a long-forgotten sense of purpose, Bunyan and Babe, the blue ox, get wrapped up in a brand new adventure and together with the help of their new friends, Travis and Whitney, they save the town. They learn firsthand that you don't have to be big to accomplish big things.

In May 2008, it was reported that Tony Bancroft would co-direct the film with Rygiel. Bancroft then worked some time on pre-production and, by 2014, he was attached as the only director, but he later left the project. Sparx Animation Studios, following its previous collaboration with Exodus Film Group on the 2008 animated film, Igor, was hired to provide writing and special effects such as modeling, rigging, animation and texture. The character design would be handled in the United States, due to Exodus' preference of an American look. The animation at Sparx was set to begin in July 2008. As of November 2008, when Sparx closed its animation studio in Paris due to the U.S. financial crisis, the studio was no longer involved in the film. On November 3, 2010, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, and Bunyan and Babe would be another of MGM's last pre-Spyglass films to be released soon. In December 2010, MGM emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In May 2014, Cinedigm picked up North American rights to the film. Reception Common Sense Media rated the film a 3 out of 5 stars, stating \\"Bunyan and Babe is an animated feature film that finds a modern-day young brother and sister connecting with the American folkloric lumberjack Paul Bunyan and Babe, his blue ox. The two partnerships team up to help save a Minnesota town that is being taken over by an evil land developer (a comic but stereotyped businessman villain). The kids and the ox face assorted perils (chases, careening cars, falls, captures, a tranquilizing dart gun, fire), but there are no injuries or deaths. A few insults are delivered (\\"nincompoop,\\" \\"nerdface,\\" \\"ass\\") and expect some mild potty language (\\"poop,\\" \\"puke\\").

Her task was to carry stores, refrigerated items, and equipment to ships in the fleet, and to remote stations and staging areas. Ocean Chief was laid down on 30 September 1944 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Company. under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1206); launched on 28 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Anton Wille; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 4 May 1945. She was operated by the United Fruit Co. under a contract with the War Shipping Administration for almost exactly one year. Acquired by the Navy on 10 May 1946, she was renamed Alstede; designated store ship AF-48; and commissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 17 May 1946, Comdr. Alexander Kusebach, USNR, in command.  Pacific Ocean operations  Alstede completed trials and moored at the Naval Supply Depot, Oakland, California, to take on supplies destined for American servicemen participating in the postwar occupation of the islands of the Central Pacific Ocean. For over four years, the store ship made the circuit from the West Coast through the Marshall Islands to the Mariana Islands and back home to the United States. During those voyages, she most frequently visited Kwajalein and Eniwetok in the Marshalls and Guam and Saipan in the Marianas. On the outbound and return legs of those voyages, the ship made calls at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and frequently stopped at lonely Wake Island. Points of departure and return in the United States included San Diego, Long Beach, Oakland, San Francisco, Bremerton, and Seattle. Even the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in June 1950 did not at first interrupt her routine. While other American forces rushed to the aid of hard-pressed South Korea, Alstede played no role in the conflict until the end of the year. Initially, that participation consisted only of a single, round- trip voyage to Sasebo, Japan‚Äîto deliver stores to that forward base‚Äîand back to the U.S. West Coast.  Korean War operations  The last month of 1950 and the first of 1951 brought another circuit through the Marshalls and the Marianas before Alstede began to concentrate more heavily on supporting the struggle of the United Nations to stem the tide of North Korean aggression and to counter Chinese intervention on the side of that aggression. During the second month of 1951, the store ship began round-trip voyages between the West Coast and ports in Japan‚Äînotably Yokosuka and Sasebo‚Äîto the exclusion of her former Central Pacific ports of call. She made three such voyages in the spring of 1951 before entering the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for regular overhaul on 27 July 1951. When the ship emerged from the extended repair period on 8 November, she conducted local operations for a short period and then loaded cargo at Oakland. On 8 December, Alstede put to sea bound once more for the western Pacific.  Supplying units in Korean waters  The advent of 1952 heralded an even closer involvement in the Korean War. Alstede arrived in Sasebo on 18 January 1952 and remained there about three weeks. On 11 February, the ship put to sea for a replenishment rendezvous off Wonsan harbor with units of the U.S. 7th Fleet. During the ensuing seven months, the store ship shuttled back and forth between Japan and the American warships operating along the coast of Korea. On three occasions, Alstede entered port at Pusan, Korea, though each time she remained in the harbor but a few hours. The ship returned to Japan from her final replenishment mission of the year on 23 September and visited Sasebo until 2 October then moved to Yokosuka where she remained from 4 to 28 October. Returning to Sasebo on the last day of the month, she spent a week at that port before getting underway for home on 6 November. She arrived back in Oakland, California, on 21 November. However, her stay in the United States lasted only a month. On 21 December, Alstede returned to sea for another round-trip voyage to Japan. She visited Yokosuka between 6 and 8 January 1953, stopped at Sasebo from the 10th to the 16th, and returned to Yokosuka for three days before heading back to the United States on the 21st. The ship arrived back at Oakland on 4 February and, for the next month, called at several ports on the California coast before standing out of Oakland on 14 March, bound once more for the Far East. She pulled into Sasebo on 1 April and remained there for almost three weeks.  Korea and Taiwan areas of responsibility  On the 19th, the vessel put to sea to rendezvous with 7th Fleet warships operating off the Korean coast. After transferring stores at sea, she returned to Sasebo on 23 April. For the next three months, Alstede plied back and forth between Japanese ports and the combat zone off the Korean coast to replenish the men-of-war supporting United Nations' troops engaged in the struggle in Korea. At the end of July, she voyaged south from Japan to Taiwan and operated from 3 to 6 August with units of the Taiwan Strait Patrol. From there, the store ship returned north to the southeastern coast of Korea and spent five days‚Äî10 to 15 August‚Äînear Koje Do, the island where communist prisoners of war were confined. She arrived back in Sasebo on the 15th, visited there and at Yokosuka, and departed the latter port on 26 August. Alstede reached Oakland on 7 September and entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on the 11th for her regular overhaul.  Stateside overhaul  She completed overhaul on 18 November and then spent the following four weeks engaged in post-overhaul trials and refresher training. Concluding those evolutions on 14 December, the store ship moored at Treasure Island, California, for the holidays. Underway again on 11 January 1954, the ship moved to Oakland to load supplies in preparation for another tour of duty in the Far East. She put to sea for that deployment on 15 January and arrived in Sasebo on 5 February. She made one replenishment rendezvous with 7th Fleet units off the Korean coast in mid-February and‚Äîafter a return visit to Sasebo‚Äîsailed south on the 21st. The ship called at Manila in the Philippine Islands from 25 February to 1 March and put in at Takao, Taiwan, for a few hours on 6 March before setting course for Japan. She entered port at Yokosuka on 11 March to begin a month's stay before getting underway on 10 April for another swing to the south. That circuit brought visits to Subic Bay in the Philippines, Keelung, Taiwan, and Manila. During her return north, Alstede made a replenishment rendezvous off the Korean coast before reaching Sasebo on 1 May. After a bit more than a month at Sasebo, the store ship got underway again on 3 June, paid a four-day call at Yokosuka on 9 June, and headed for home.  Reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet  Since her return to the United States on 22 June coincided with a reassignment to the Atlantic Fleet, she remained at Oakland only eight days before sailing for Norfolk, Virginia. En route, the store ship stopped at San Diego from 2 to 4 July, arrived at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone on 12 July, and transited the Panama Canal on the 14th. Alstede moored at her new home port, Norfolk, on 19 July. Over the ensuing three months, the ship engaged in maneuvers and other evolutions in and out of Norfolk. On 11 October, she began taking on supplies in preparation for her first tour of duty with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea and, 11 days later passed between Cape Charles and Cape Henry to begin her first Atlantic crossing. The ship entered the \\"middle sea\\" around the end of the month and made her first port call‚Äîat Naples, Italy‚Äîon 4 and 5 November. Visits to Salonika, Greece, and Valencia, Spain, punctuated her replenishment missions with elements of the 6th Fleet. Alstede made a return call at Naples from 4 to 7 December before setting a course for home. She concluded her first Mediterranean deployment upon arrival back at Norfolk on 23 December.  Overhaul work at Staten Island and Norfolk  Holiday routine and post- deployment leave and upkeep occupied the remainder of 1954 and the first two weeks of 1955. After unloading supplies at the Norfolk Naval Supply Center and ammunition at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Earle, New Jersey, Alstede entered the Bethlehem Steel yard at Staten Island, New York, on 21 January for a regularly scheduled overhaul. She left the yard on 22 March and, after taking on ammunition at Earle, returned to Norfolk on the 24th. The ship spent just over three weeks at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard before getting underway on 15 April for post-overhaul refresher training in the vicinity of Newport, Rhode Island. She again moored at Norfolk on 6 May but remained there only eight days before putting to sea on the 14th. Alstede steamed north to the waters near Argentia, Newfoundland. There, she joined and in testing underway replenishment equipment. The store ship arrived back in Norfolk on 29 May and began preparations to deploy to the Mediterranean once again.  Second Med cruise  Alstede exited the Chesapeake Bay on 17 June. After 10 days in the Atlantic Ocean the ship transited the Strait of Gibraltar on 27 June and joined the 6th Fleet. For the next two months, she varied underway replenishment missions with visits to such ports as Golfe Juan, France; Barcelona and Valencia, Spain; Phaleron Bay, Greece; and Naples, Italy. The store ship departed the latter port on 28 August on her way back to the United States. She arrived back in Norfolk on 10 September and began a month in port after the cruise to the Mediterranean. On 16 October, she put to sea once more and shaped a course northward. For several days, Alstede participated in antisubmarine warfare exercises in Block Island Sound. She returned to Norfolk on 21 October to undergo repairs at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Back at sea on 9 November, the store ship embarked upon a 19-day cruise to the West Indies. During that mission, she tested underway replenishment equipment and made port calls at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The vessel arrived back in Norfolk on 28 November and, two weeks later, entered the shipyard of the Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. for a month of repairs. Alstede replenishes , circa in 1964.  January 1956 Med tour  She emerged from the shipyard on 6 January 1956 and headed for the Naval Supply Center, Norfolk, to take on supplies. Alstede operated out of Norfolk for the next two months. On 7 March, she got underway to return to the Mediterranean. After passing through the Strait of Gibraltar on 20 March, the store ship replenished units of the 6th Fleet over the next month and made visits to Cannes, France; Naples, Italy; Cagliari, Sardinia; Tangier, French Morocco; and at the Spanish ports of Barcelona and Valencia. She departed Barcelona on 23 April and shaped a course back to the United States. The ship arrived back in Norfolk on 5 May and began repairs to her hull which had been damaged in a collision while provisioning in Cannes on 23 March. The repair period lasted until late August, and 18 days of local operations followed. On 14 September, she headed back to the Mediterranean.  Routine operations  At that point, the pattern for the remainder of Alstede's career was established. For the next 13 years, the stores ship deployed to the Mediterranean Sea two or three times a year to resupply units of the U.S. 6th Fleet operating there. When not assigned to that fleet, she engaged in diverse occupations. The ship participated in U.S. 2d Fleet training exercises along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies as well as conducting independent ship's drills. She entered shipyards periodically to undergo her normal overhauls.  Awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal  Of special note, the late spring of 1965 brought Alstede the award of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal when she provided logistics support for the Navy ships which constituted a portion of the Organization of American States' peacekeeping force sent to the Dominican Republic to mediate the civil strife that had broken out between supporters of the ousted president, Juan Bosch, and forces of the ruling, three-man junta that had supplanted him. Her schedule of Mediterranean resupply missions alternated with 2d Fleet operations and repair periods came to an end on 31 October 1969 when she was decommissioned.  Decommissioning  Her name was struck from the Navy List that same day. Berthed at the Naval Inactive Ship Facility, Norfolk, Virginia, for non-industrial stripping she was sold to N.W. Kennedy, Ltd., of Vancouver, Canada, on 2 June 1970 for scrapping.

The EPA has cited this report as a catalyst for the creation of the FQPA.  Background  Legislation similar to the FQPA was drafted and presented to Congress in 1995 but was never acted on. In 1996, the political landscape had changed and new pressures to act on pesticide control reform surfaced. In 1991, a coalition of environmental groups sued the EPA for failing to enforce the Delaney clause. The Delaney clause, an amendment of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, banned all food that contained any trace amount of any pesticide that may cause cancer. Although the EPA argued that the legislation was outdated and should not apply to the current situation, the coalition won in 1995 and the EPA was slated to ban 80 pesticides in late 1996. Under these new, more urgent circumstances, Congress was able to pass a bill that was celebrated by both sides of the debate; farmers, food processors and pesticide manufactures were glad to see the Delaney Clause go, while environmental groups and consumer advocates were pleased to have a formalized safety standard with an added emphasis on children. John Cady, president of the National Food Processors Association, praised the legislation for being \\"...based on modern, real-world science\\". A cropduster spraying pesticide on a field FQPA requirements The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 has the following requirements: Improved health standards for food commodities The FQPA established a new safety standard (reasonable certainty of no harm) that must be applied to all food commodities. In addition to the new standard the EPA now has to consider the specific risks pesticides might have for infants and children. The FQPA required the re-testing of all existing pesticide tolerance levels, of which there were more 9,700Susan Wayland and Penelope Fenner-Crisp. ‚ÄúReducing Pesticide Risks: A Half Century of Progress.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association. March 2016., within 10 years. When assessing this risk the EPA is required to take into account the \\"aggregate risk\\" (the exposure to a pesticide from multiple sources) and the \\"cumulative exposure\\" to pesticides with similar mechanisms of toxicity. To do this the EPA is required to establish new science policies to assess the risks.http://www.epa.gov/pesticide-science-and-assessing-pesticide- risks/cumulative-assessment-risk-pesticides The FQPA requires the EPA to set tolerances for pesticide uses that fall under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (emergency exemptions). Cumulative risk assessment The EPA has established guidance for assessing the cumulative risk for multiroute exposures to pesticide groups determined to have a common mechanism of toxicity.http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/guidance_on_common_mechanism.pdf The Agency has also published guidance on determining whether chemicals share a common mechanism of toxicity, i.e., whether they can be assessed as a common mechanism group.http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/guide-2-identify- pest-chem_0.pdf The risk calculation is based on dose addition, where individual pesticide exposure levels are scaled by their relative potency and then summed. Some key uncertainties in this approach include the possibility that relative potency changes with dose, and the potential for toxicological interactions (dose addition assumes no toxicological interactionsU.S. EPA. 2000. Supplementary guidance for conducting health risk assessment of chemical mixtures. EPA/630/R-00/002. Washington, DC:Risk Assessment Forum. ). Another caution is that the resulting risk assessments are not complete environmental health evaluations of all chemical exposures, but only represent risks from those common mechanism pesticides. Reduced risk pesticides The FQPA mandates that the EPA expedite the approval of reduced risk pesticides. To be considered reduced risk pesticides must have a proven low-impact on human health, have low toxicity to non-target organisms and have a low potential to contaminate groundwater. Minor uses The FQPA requires the EPA to give special consideration to pesticides used on products that have less than 300,000 acres of total U.S. production or products that do not have enough economic incentive to either support an initial registration or a continuing registration. Public health pesticides The FQPA requires the EPA to establish a list of pests that are considered significant to public health and to give special consideration to pesticides with public health uses. The EPA is also required to provide maintenance fee waivers to and encourage the safe and necessary use of methods/pesticides that either combat or control pests that have been deemed of public health importance. The EPA also provides waiver fees for the pesticides used on pests that are deemed of public health importance. Antimicrobial reform The FQPA mandates the EPA to expedite the review of applications that are requesting the registration of antimicrobial products. The FQPA also exempts certain antimicrobial products from the container provisions in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. USDA initiatives The FQPA requires the conduction of food consumption surveys that track food consumption and related behaviors in the U.S. population. The FQPA mandates the collection of pesticide residue and use data. The FQPA mandated the promotion of integrated pest management solutions. Other The FQPA requires that pesticide registration be reviewed periodically, with a goal of once every 15 years. The FQPA mandated changes in the collection of tolerance fee's, increasing the amount of fee money from $14 million to $16 million to help with the reassessment of tolerances. The FQPA requires the EPA to specifically screen pesticides for disruption to the endocrine system. The FQPA requires the EPA to establish an integrated pest management education program and implement integrated pest management research and demonstration. The FQPA encourages the syncing of U.S. pesticide tolerances with those of international standards. Under the FQPA individual states are not allowed to set different pesticide tolerances than the EPA and the EPA is required to coordinate data requirements between the state and federal levels. The EPA is required to develop and distribute a food safety brochure and create an annual report on the progress of its registration program.  Impact  The FQPA was the most comprehensive reform of food safety and pesticide laws in decades and posed an implementation challenge for the EPA. Immediately following the passing of the FQPA, the EPA moved to create the Food Safety Advisory Committee. The committee was founded with the intention of fostering an open and public implementation process. Within 10 years, the EPA had successfully reassessed 99% of the nation's pesticide tolerances (recommending the revocation of 3,200, recommending the modification of 1,200 and approving 5,237). In addition to the reassessing of pesticide tolerances, the EPA accommodated the use of special classes of pesticides, addressed the public policy issue of clinical studies to verify pesticide effects, and expedited the availability of safe pesticides. Agronomist Sharon Benzen shows off broccoli grown in a test plot. The crops will be used to help determine appropriate pesticide residue levels. While the EPA did limit, and in some cases ban, the use of pesticides following the passing of the FQPA, not every stakeholder was pleased with their level of action. Referring to the discrepancies between what constitutes reliable data when determining whether or not to increase the margin of safety tenfold, Richard Weiss (a pesticide expert with the Environmental Working Group) said, \\"The EPA has failed to comply with the clear intent and requirements of the law\\". While environmentalists complained, so did farmers. As their ability to harvest quality crops was threatened, farmers said the EPA was unfairly enforcing a \\"zero risk\\" instead of a \\"reasonable certainty of no harm\\" policy. The EPA responded saying that while they were more stringent after the passing of the FQPA, they were not operating under a no risk/no harm rule.  Emphasis on children  The passing of the FQPA marked the first time the EPA was asked to directly address the risks pesticides pose for infants and children. Because children are smaller, the pesticides they ingest have a proportionately greater impact. The FQPA required the EPA to enforce a safety margin 10 times greater than before if reliable data proving that the pesticide posed no risk for children could not be provided. After the bill's passing, former President Bill Clinton said, \\"If a pesticide poses a danger to our children, then it won't be in our food\\". In 1999, the EPA banned most uses of methyl parathion and azinphos methyl, citing the risks they pose to children. Both methyl parathion and azinphos methyl are organophosphates. Organophosphates are pesticides that kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these pesticides have the same effect on humans. In 2000, the EPA banned another organophosphate, (chlorpyrifos), that was common in the agriculture industry, household cleaners and commercial pest control products, due to a study showing that chlorpyrifos caused weakness, vomiting and diarrhea in baby rats. The restrictions on these pesticides, although mandated on the premise of child safety, were not received unanimously well by groups outside the EPA. Both agriculture representatives and environmentalists sounded off after the EPA made its decisions.Cushman, J. (December 19, 1997) Pesticide child-safety limits have EPA drawing fire. The Charleston Gazette. \\"Chemical Business News\\" published an article suggesting that the idea that pesticides pose special dangers for children was actually an alarmist issue not based in science.Pesticide Outlook: Are infants and children really more vulnerable than adults to the potential adverse effects of pesticides? (November 16, 2000) Agriculture lobbies claimed that the banning of organophosphates would cause the agriculture industry an annual loss of $1.8 billion.EPA Pesticide crackdown gets plenty of complaints. (August 9, 1999) The San Francisco Chronicle. Environmentalists argued that the EPA was buckling under the pressure of these lobbies and needed to uphold the legal safety standard mandated in the FQPA. In response the EPA published a report saying that they stood by their decisions and the 10 fold safety increase was both conservative and prudent and was only applicable under special circumstances.  Clinical studies debate  In 1998, the EPA placed a moratorium on clinical studies, or human studies, citing both ethical and scientific concerns. While the use of clinical studies for pesticide tolerances had been in decline since the 1980s, the passing of the FQPA re- generated interest in the practice. By testing on humans, pesticide manufacturers could eliminate the additional safety margins required when using data collected from animal testing. Following their moratorium the EPA had the National Academy of Sciences convene a panel of experts to determine the ethical solution to the human studies debate. While the National Academy of Sciences established the panel, both pesticide manufacturers and environmentalists established their own opinions. The Environmental Working Group and the Natural Resources Defense Council argued that clinical studies were both inaccurate and ethically wrong; pesticide manufacturers argued that not only were clinical studies crucial but that they must be allowed to conduct the tests to determine \\"No observable adverse effects level\\", meaning they administer the drug until an effect is observed. The National Academy of Sciences released a report in 2004 supporting the use of clinical studies under strict regulations; the regulations mandated that the study's benefit to society outweigh the risk to the individual, that the study be conducted under a strict ethical code, that there be reasonable certainty that no harm will come to participants and that it has been shown that no other study will work. In 2005, adhering to a congressional directive, the EPA adopted the Human Studies Regulation; the regulations permit human studies, do not allow the use of pregnant women or children in human studies, mandate that a strict ethical code be followed and establish a Human Studies Review Board to oversee the use of human studies. The EPA considers the regulations as a major accomplishment in public policy.

Ancestry and childhood Dering was the eldest son of Sir Anthony Dering (d.1636) of Surrenden Dering. His mother, Sir Anthony's second wife, was Frances, daughter of Chief Baron Robert Bell. He was born in the Tower of London on 28 January 1598, his father being the deputy-lieutenant. He was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Early career After leaving the university he devoted himself to antiquarian studies and to the collection of manuscripts. On 22 January 1619 he was knighted at Newmarket, and in November of the same year married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Nicholas Tufton. She died on 24 January 1622. According to an entry in his account book, he purchased two copies of William Shakespeare's First Folio on 5 December 1623: this is the earliest recorded retail purchase of this famous book.Sotheby's, The SHAKESPEARE FIRST FOLIO, 1623: The Dr. Williams's Library Copy, 13 July 2006; \\"Three Issues\\" p. 26; auction catalogue research by Peter Selley and Dr. Peter Beal. Dering subsequently married Anne, daughter of Sir John Ashburnham. Lady Ashburnham, his new mother-in-law, being of the Beaumont family, was a connection of the king's favourite, Buckingham. Through her, Dering strove for court favour and was created a baronet on 1 February 1626 (1627 New Style). Buckingham's assassination in 1628 cut short Dering's ambitions at court. He lost his second wife in the same year that he lost his patron. Sir Edward Dering On 20 November in the year of his wife's death Dering became one of the many suitors of a rich city widow, Mrs Bennett, and kept a curious journal of his efforts to win her, especially of the bribes which he administered to the lady's servants. Mrs Bennett, however, married Sir Heneage Finch on 16 April 1629, and shortly afterwards Dering married his third wife, Unton, daughter of Sir Ralph Gibbs, his 'ever dear Numps', as he calls her in the letters which he addressed to her. He had lately been appointed lieutenant of Dover Castle,Person - The Miscellany an office for which he paid the late holder of the post, and which brought him in much less than he expected. When he at last managed to be quit of it, he was able to devote himself more freely to the antiquarian pursuits at which he was most at home. Religious belief and controversy Antiquarian studies could, in the days of William Laud's power, hardly fail to connect themselves with reflections on the existing state of the church. Dering was one of a numerous class which was distinctly protestant without being puritan. Since his father's death in 1636 he was owner of the family property (the house and park of Surrenden Dering, now known as Surrenden House), and a person of consequence in Kent. Sir Edward served as Member of Parliament for Hythe in 1629. He was chosen to represent Kent in the Long Parliament. He took an active part in all measures of church reform, and became chairman of the committee on religion. On 13 January 1641, having had a petition from 2500 of his constituents sent to him for presentation, in which they complained about the government of archbishops, etc. and which asked the House of Commons 'that the said government, with all its dependencies, root and branch, may be abolished', he altered the petition, and made it ask 'that this hierarchical power may be totally abrogated', so as to avoid committing himself to an approval of divine-right presbyterianism. During Strafford's trial he took the popular side, \\"and wrote to his wife how he heard people say 'God bless your worship'\\" as he passed. On 27 May Dering moved the first reading of the Root and Branch Bill, which is said to have been drawn up by Oliver St John, apparently not because he thoroughly sympathised with its prayer, but because he thought its introduction would terrify the lords into passing a bill for the exclusion of bishops from their seats in parliament which was then before them: > ... the chief end then was to expedite the progress of another bill against > the secular jurisdiction of the bishops (at that time) labouring in the > House of Lords... I did not dream... at that time of extirpation and > abolition of any more than his achiepiscopacy: our professed rooters > themselves (many of them) at that hour had, I persuade myself, more moderate > hopes than since are entertained. Dering's real sentiments were disclosed when the bill was in committee, when he argued in defence of primitive episcopacy, that is to say, of a plan for insuring that bishops should do nothing without the concurrence of their clergy. It was a plan which appealed strongly to students of antiquity; but it is no wonder that he was now treated by the more thoroughgoing opponents of episcopacy as a man who could no longer be trusted. In the debate on 12 October on the second Bishops Exclusion Bill, Dering proposed that a national synod should be called to remove the distractions of the church. In the discussion on the Grand Remonstrance he assailed the doctrine that bishops had brought popery and idolatry into the church, and he subsequently defended the retention of bishops on the ground that, if the prizes of the lottery were taken away, few would care to acquire learning. By his final vote on the Grand Remonstrance he threw in his lot with the episcopal royalist party. It was the vote, not of a statesman, but of a student, anxious to find some middle term between the rule of Laud and the rule of a Scottish presbytery, and attacking the party which at any moment seemed likely to acquire undue predominance. Dering began to overestimate the amount of consistency which lies at the bottom of almost all changes of opinion honestly made. He prepared for publication an edition of his speeches with explanatory comments of his own. On 4 February the House of Commons ordered the book to be burnt and himself to be sent to the Tower. He remained a prisoner till the 11th. Dering's imprisonment probably threw him more decidedly on the king's side than he had intended. On 25 March he took a leading part in the Maidstone assizes in getting up a petition from the grand jury in favour of episcopy and the prayer-book. On this he was impeached by the commons, but he contrived to escape. English Civil War At the opening of the civil war Dering raised a regiment of cavalry for the king. Dering was even less a soldier than he was a statesman. He was in bad health, and the talk of the camp probably disgusted him. Even before the battle of Edgehill he inquired on what terms he might be allowed to submit to parliament. Nothing came of the negotiation, but before the opening of the campaign of 1643 he threw up his commission. It is said that he asked the king in vain to give him the deanery of Canterbury. Every month that passed must have made his position at Oxford more painful. Not only had primitive episcopacy vanished, but Charles in September made a cessation with the confederate Catholics of Ireland, and negotiations were subsequently opened with the object of bringing Irish catholic soldiers into England. On 30 January 1644 parliament issued a declaration offering pardon to those who had taken up arms against them if they would take the covenant and pay a composition for the restoration of their sequestered estates. Dering was the first to accept the terms, and he had leave to go home. The composition was settled at ¬£1,000 on 27 July; but Dering, who had been kept out of his property till his payment had been arranged, was already beyond parliamentary jurisdiction. He died on 22 June, 1644, having suffered much from poverty after his return. Dering's position at the end of his life may be best illustrated from a Discourse on Sacrifice, which was published by him in June 1644, though it was written in the summer of 1640. In issuing it to the world he declares that he wishes for peace and for the return of the king to his parliament. \\"In the meantime,\\" he adds, \\"I dare wish that he would make less value of such men both lay and clergy who, by running on the Canterbury pace, have made our breaches so wide and take less delight in the specious way of cathedral devotions\\". These words exhibit Dering as a fair representative of that important part of the nation which set itself against extreme courses, though it was unable to embody its desires in any practically working scheme. Antiquarian studies Dering's antiquarian interests led him to amass a great library; his name is still associated with: :the Dering Roll, an important 13th century Roll of arms, believed to be the earliest surviving English roll of arms. In 2008, the Roll was purchased by the British Library.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7595959.stm :The Dering Manuscript of Henry IV, Part 1, the earliest surviving manuscript of a play by William Shakespeare.

Greene competed in wrestling and football at the University of Michigan from 1940 to 1944. He was captain of the Michigan wrestling team in 1944 and was also selected to play in the 11th annual Chicago College All-Star Game that same year. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1989. Greene was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 1944 NFL Draft and played seven seasons for the Lions from 1944 to 1950. After moving to the end position in 1945, Greene became a star, ranking among the National Football League (NFL) leaders in receptions and/or receiving yards each year from 1945 to 1949. He had an 88-yard touchdown reception that was the longest pass play in the NFL during the 1946 season and the longest in Detroit Lions history up to that time. When he retired, he was the Lions' all-time leading receiver with 2,965 receiving yards, 26 touchdown catches and 173 receptions. He also served as an assistant coach for the Lions during the 1951 season. Early years Greene was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1920. He attended high school at The Kiski School in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania. University of Michigan Greene enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1940. While he was a student at Michigan, Greene was a member of the Michigan Wolverines wrestling team coached by Cliff Keen. In 1943, he lost 15 pounds to qualify for the 175-pound weight class. He finished the 1943 season in third place in the Big Ten Conference. In 1944, he was the team captain, compiled a 16-7 record, and was the Big Ten Conference runner up. Green also played for the Michigan Wolverines football team under head coach Fritz Crisler. In 1940, he played for Michigan's all-freshman team. As a sophomore, he was a 6-foot, 0 inch, 191-pound backup at the quarterback position for the 1941 Michigan Wolverines football team. Greene remained at Michigan during the World War II years, having been classified 4-F due to a perforated or punctured eardrum. During Greene's junior year, George Ceithaml started all 10 games at quarterback for the 1942 Michigan football team, and Greene became a backup at the tackle position. As a senior, Greene remained a backup at the tackle position, but he was awarded a varsity letter for his contributions to the 1943 Michigan Wolverines football team. Despite the fact that he was not a starter at Michigan, Greene was invited in the summer of 1944 to participate on the 11th annual Chicago College All-Star Game, an annual game matching a collegiate all-star team against the prior season's NFL championship team. Detroit Lions Greene was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round (35th overall pick) of the 1944 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 1944, Greene appeared in nine games, five of them as a starter. He was used principally as a blocking back. 1945 season For the 1945 season, the Lions' head coach Gus Dorais moved Greene to the end position after being impressed with his speed. Greene started all 10 games for the Lions at the end position in 1945. He led the 1945 Lions in receiving with 26 receptions for 550 yards (21.2 yards per catch) and five receiving touchdowns. He also ranked fifth among all NFL players in receptions, receiving yards, and yards per catch during the 1945 season. 1946 season Greene's production fell off during the 1946 season, as he appeared in all ten games, but only started two games. The highlight of Greene's 1946 season came in a 17-7 victory (the Lions' only victory in 1946) over the Pittsburgh Steelers on November 10, 1946. In that game, Greene caught a pass from Dave Ryan at midfield and ran the remaining 50 yards for a touchdown. The play, good for an 88-yard gain, was the longest pass play in the NFL during the 1946 season and the longest in Detroit Lions history up to that time. Even with the reduced playing time, Greene's 22 receptions in 1946 ranked eighth in the NFL. 1947 season During the 1947 season, Greene was the Lions' leading receiver for the third straight year. He appeared in 12 games (six as a starter) and caught 38 passes for 621 yards (16.3 yards per catch). He ranked sixth in the NFL in both receptions and receiving yards. Greene's longest reception of the 1947 season was a 47-yard gain on a pass from Roy Zimmerman in a 35-7 victory over the New York Giants. Greene acquired the nickname \\"the Cinderella Kid\\" while playing for the Lions, a reference to \\"his rise to stardom after comparative obscurity while a lineman in college and early in his Lions' career.\\" 1948 season In 1948, Greene led the Lions in receiving yards for the fourth consecutive season. He appeared in 12 games (five as a starter) and caught 25 passes for 595 yards and five touchdowns. His average of 23.8 yards per reception was the best in the NFL. The 1948 Detroit Lions season was notable for the racial integration of the team. African-American halfback Mel Groomes joined the Lions in 1948, as did African-American end Bob Mann. Mann and Greene, both University of Michigan alumni, led the Lions' receiving corps. Mann caught 33 passes for 560 yards in 1948, only 35 yards behind Greene. Wallace Triplett, an African-American player who joined the Lions in 1949, praised Greene for his leadership in welcoming the African-American players. Triplett recalled: \\"I want to say 'thank you' to John because what we have now in the NFL would not have been possible had it not been for him and others like Bill Dudley. John was a star and a captain for the Lions. So, when he and Bill came over to me in the locker room, shook my hand and welcomed me to the Lions, it made a huge impact in my acceptance on the team and in the League. I will always appreciate what John and Bill did for me.\\" 1949 season For the 1949 season, Greene was selected as a co-captain of the Lions along with Russ Thomas. Greeene appeared in all 12 games for the 1949 Lions, 11 of them as a starter. He had career highs in receptions (44) and receiving touchdowns (7), and ranked seventh and fifth among all NFL players in those two categories. 1950 season The 1950 season was Greene's last in the NFL. The season began on a high note for Greene as he caught a pass from Bobby Layne for a 78-yard gain in a pre-season game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Greene appeared in all 12 games for the 1950 Lions, but he was not a starter. He caught 22 passes for 368 yards. Cloyce Box and Doak Walker led the 1950 Lions in receiving, as Bobby Layne began his tenure as the team's quarterback. Career statistics Greene played seven seasons in the National Football League, all for the Lions. When he retired after the 1950 season, he was the Lions' all-time leading receiver with 2,965 receiving yards, 26 touchdown catches and 173 receptions. Greene remained with the Lions in 1951 as an assistant coach. After several consecutive years finishing near the bottom of their division, the 1951 Lions compiled a 7-4-1 record and finished in second place in the NFL National Division. Later years Greene lived in Franklin, Michigan, in his later years. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor as a wrestler in 1989. In November 2010, he died at his home in Franklin at age 90. He was survived by his wife Alice. He was also survived by his sister Margaret E. Greene McArdle.

The Act was an important step in moving the ancient Admiralty Court of England and Wales towards its modern constitution. It was also an important step in the abolition of Doctors' Commons. Background English Admiralty law is based not on the common law but on civil law, though with some common law and statutory developments. As such, it was historically administered, not by the practitioners in the common law courts but by the practitioners in the ecclesiastical courts, who were organised in the Doctors' Commons and called \\"advocates\\" and \\"proctors,\\" rather than barristers and solicitors. This demarcation was widely held to be restrictive and by the middle of the nineteenth century there was pressure for reform, culminating in the Court of Probate Act 1857 which started the process of abolition of Doctors' Commons which was completed in 1865.Squibb (1977) p.104-105 The Act and its effect The Act received its royal assent on 8 August 1859. The long title of the Act was: By allowing the common lawyers to practise in the Admiralty court, the civil lawyers were deprived of one of their few remaining privileges, thus hastening the demise of their separate constitution.

Biography Ward was the adopted son of Bill and Eunice Andrews and raised in Charlton Kings near Cheltenham. Tim played football on the local pitches with his childhood friend Cedric, during these games Cedric would be Arsenal and Tim would be Derby County. He attended Charlton Kings Boys School. Playing career Ward played football for Cheltenham Schools and Charlton Kings before signing for Cheltenham Town who were then embarking on their first seasons in the Southern Football league. In 1937 Ward had an unsuccessful trial for Leicester City risking the sack from his job, before catching the attention of Derby County scout Jackie Whitehouse. He joined the club on trial, scoring with the first kick of his first trial match with Derby County 'A', and convinced George Jobey to pay Cheltenham ¬£100 and became a full-time professional, playing at left half, replacing England international defender Errington Keen. Like many of his generation, Ward's career was adversely affected by the outbreak of World War II, and during his time in the army Ward made guest appearances for Notts County, Hamilton Academical and Leeds United and also played for the Scottish Army XI before he was sent to fight in Europe. After the war Ward played for the BAOR team before being demobbed. His time in Germany saw him miss all but one game of Derby's 1946 FA Cup campaign. Ward was philosophical on missing the final, saying 'So many of my friends were killed in the war and I regarded myself lucky to emerge from it, rather than unlucky to miss Wembley.\\" On his return to England, despite Arsenal offering ¬£10,000 for his services, Derby found him a position at right-half, where he was successful enough to gain 2 full England caps, making his debut against Belgium on 21 September 1947 at The Heysel Stadium and also appearing against Wales at Villa Park on 10 November 1948. He was also part of the FA Tour of Canada in 1950. He was sold to Barnsley in 1951, spending two years with the Tykes before entering management. Managerial career Ward's management career started with an 8-day stay as Exeter City manager. After being appointed manager on 4 March 1953, and despite travelling to their Third Division South match against Ipswich Town, Barnsley, who had never released Ward, recalled him on 12 March and appointed him manager two weeks later. Though he arrived too late to save Barnsley from relegation, he achieved promotion straight away as Third Division North Champions in 1955. Though Barnsley were relegated again four years later, he was still comfortably established at Oakwell until joining Grimsby in January 1960. Another promotion followed as Grimsby finished runners up in the 1961‚Äì62 Third Division, finishing just three points behind winners Portsmouth. His success at Grimsby saw him coveted by Derby County, who appointed him manager ahead of the 1962‚Äì63 season. At the time Derby were established as a Second Division side and, after four years of finishing progressively higher in the league (18th, 13th, 9th, 8th), the club dipped to 17th in the 1966/67 season and the club decided not to renew his contract, replacing him with Brian Clough. Ward's five years at Derby were blighted by a lack of cash and a parochial attitude in the boardroom, but he is often credited with laying the foundations for the success of his successor, such as signing Colin Boulton, Peter Daniel, Kevin Hector, Alan Durban and Ron Webster, all of whom were part of Clough's 1972 Football League winning side. Ward claimed that the successful signing of Eddie Thomas for just ¬£3,500, counted against him, saying \\"(Thomas) proved a marvellous bargain and after that I was expected to sign other players as cheaply.\\" After Derby, Ward spent 15 months as manager of Carlisle United before leaving football management completely. Post Management Following his retirement from management, Ward ran the ex-Derby County football side and was instrumental in the formation of the Derby County Former Player's Association in 1991, becoming the first chairman. He also held a position of scout for Nottingham Forest.

History The present MV Hebrides revived a traditional name on the \\"Uig Triangle\\" and is the third vessel in the CalMac fleet to have borne that name over the years. She carries the bell of the first (an 1898 steamer) which also graced the second \\"Heb\\" (1964). The 1964 ship was MacBrayne's first car ferry and very much a favourite, which for twenty years also sailed from Uig, Skye. Following successful sea trials on the Clyde in early 2001, the Hebrides made her way round to Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, where she conducted berthing trials at the three linkspans. Uig and Tarbert piers had to be specially extended to accommodate this new larger vessel. On entry into service on 24 March 2001 she displaced the to Islay. Her service speed is , which cuts the crossing times to around 100 minutes and allows three return trips per day. There were no Sunday sailings to or from Tarbert, so the Hebrides concentrated on serving Lochmaddy on North Uist. The ratio of crossings is something like 2:1 in favour of North Uist. Having the at Stornoway (serving Lewis and Harris), and in 2003 the introduction of the new (making inter-island access easier) have encouraged this trend. Hebrides brought with her the highest level of passenger comfort ever seen in the fleet. Despite a passenger certificate for around 600, she never feels crowded. Only at peak times does she need to use her mezzanine car deck for extra cars. With a ship of this size on permanent station at Uig, future increases in demand can be met for many years. Hebrides is due to be replaced on the Uig Triangle in spring 2023 by a new ferry (Hull 802) being built at Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow on the Clyde. The new ferry will be named by online vote and is one of two identical sister- ships: will enter service on the Ardrossan-Brodick ferry crossing from late 2021 partnering , and Hebrides may then serve the Oban-Craignure ferry crossing in summer 2023, partnering . Layout MV Hebrides design is very similar to that of her half-sister, of 1998. There is an increased amount of open deck space, the majority of it being covered. She was the first vessel of the fleet to be equipped with a Marine Evacuation System of inflatable chutes leading to large liferafts in place of conventional lifeboats. Following simulations and the success of the Clansman‚Äôs design, her hull incorporates fewer gaps for water to escape from the car deck. The Hebrides loads vehicles via a stern ramp at Uig and through her bow at the two Outer Isles ports. Like the Clansman, she has an open stern, allowing her to carry hazardous goods whilst still carrying foot passengers. The car deck has room for approximately 80 cars. A mezzanine deck on the starboard side can be raised or lowered to allow loading of eighteen more cars. The entrance lobby has the shop and information desk. Forward are a lounge and Mariners Cafeteria at the bow. Aft is the Chieftain Bar and open deck area. On the deck above are an observation lounge at the bow, crew accommodation and further open deck. Service Hebrides was the main winter relief vessel over the 2012/13 period, with the Stornoway to Ullapool service being one of the routes she covered. She is seen loading at Stornoway linkspan on 6 October 2013, during an unexpected second relief stint there, in place of the broken-down . MV Hebrides is normally found sailing from Uig on Skye to Tarbert and Lochmaddy, and rarely sailed anywhere else in her early service life. One notable exception was during closure of the Uig linkspan, when she sailed from Ullapool for a week or so. At the time she was in company with which was relieving on the Ullapool crossing. Similarly, when the linkspan at Lochmaddy was closed for repairs, Hebrides used the facilities at Lochboisdale in South Uist. During the spring of 2007 the ship was converted to burn oil, and was trialled on the Oban to Coll, Tiree and Barra and South Uist services. Her sister, Clansman, soon returned, and Hebrides spent another five years never deviating from her route except for her annual overhaul, which was usually done either at Greenock, Aberdeen, Leith or Birkenhead. In August 2012, CalMac announced that Hebrides was to be the main relief vessel for the next winter, a role which had usually been assigned to her sister . The Islay ferry was chosen as Hebrides replacement at Uig, Lochmaddy and Tarbert from 1 December. In December 2012, Hebrides relieved on the Oban to Craignure and Colonsay services, as well as running extra services to Coll, Tiree, Barra and South Uist over the festive season. In January 2013, Hebrides relieved on the Ardrossan to Brodick service, and in February relieved on the Ullapool to Stornoway service. Hebrides then relieved on the Outer Isles services in March, before finally returning to the Uig, Lochmaddy & Tarbert triangle after her own overhaul, before the summer timetable started in March 2013. In October 2013, she made an unexpected return to Stornoway to relieve the broken-down , which went into drydock for propeller shaft problems. In July 2015, this situation was reversed, when Hebrides suffered a breakdown leading to her visiting Stornoway for repairs for two days, with Isle of Lewis taking over her Uig, Lochmaddy & Tarbert triangle until she was repaired. Hebrides became a relief vessel for January and February 2016, with her regular duties being covered by and . Hebrides was granted special dispensation by the MCA to continue operating after her passenger safety certificate ran out in 2018. Her annual overhaul had been delayed while she deputised for , whose propulsion system had been damaged on entering dry dock. In September 2018, Hebrides operated to Stornoway whilst the pier at Tarbert was occupied by the damaged Norwegian freighter Fame. Incident in 2016 On 1 October 2016 Hebrides was taken into the Garvel dry dock, Greenock, for inspection and repairs. Hebrides collided with pontoons and then ran aground at Lochmaddy on 25 September 2016, after apparently suffering engine difficulties. It was reported that the vessel became stuck in forward gear and remained in gear after running aground. The vessel later managed to dock and disembark the passengers and vehicles aboard. Calmac reported that the hull was intact and that divers were en route to inspect the damage. Following inspection, Hebrides was moved to Greenock for drydocking and repairs. Meanwhile Clansman was transferred to Uig to take over the route, with Isle of Lewis providing an additional sailing from Lochmaddy to Uig to clear the backlog of traffic. Hebrides returned to service on 17 October 2016.

Between the years 1963‚Äì1966, a total of 56 locomotives had been produced -- 27 of which were used by PKP.

Despite their relatively short operational history, the engineers who drove the locomotives remember them as being very powerful machines. Technical data The SM15 is equipped with a Soviet 550 kW diesel engine (a number of SM15s had Polish V12CD9 engines installed, rather than the Soviet variant) with hydromechanical transmission. Certain models destined for use in industry had hydraulic transmission, and these carried the designation Ls750Hu. The SM15 is a B‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ locomotive, which means that the unit runs on two bogies, with all axles powered.

It was established in 1929 and closed in August 2012. In its final year, it had 61 pupils, a mixture of day children and boarders. The school was situated at Langton Hall between 1946 and 2012, historically the seat of the Norcliffe family. The Hall that was leased to Woodleigh School, owned at the time by their descendants, the Howard-Vyse family, is a Grade II* listed building. History The gates of Langton Hall The school was founded in 1929 in Hessle, near Hull, by the late Arthur England, grandfather of the last headmaster. There were no other boys‚Äô preparatory schools in the area at the time. By 1930, two years after the school had launched, there were 25 pupils. During the war Woodleigh moved to Firby Hall near Westow village in 1939. General Norcliffe, the ancestral owner, in his study at Langton Hall In 1946 the school moved to Langton Hall, south of Malton, in the Yorkshire Wolds. The hall was previously owned by the Howard-Vyse family, descendants of the Norcliffe family. The oldest part of the house, formerly the old manor house, was by then in a bad state of repair. During the Second World War Langton Hall had been used as a base for the Guards Armoured Division while they had been preparing for D-Day. The Guards were reputedly visited by the Royal Family and Winston Churchill while they were based at the house. (see also excerpt from the first edition on the website of Woodleigh School) The hall itself dates back to the 18th century. The north wing was built in 1738 and the south wing was added in 1840. The hall was registered as a Grade II listed building with English Heritage in 1951. The entrance gates on the east side of Langton Hall and the flanking wall, dating from the middle of the 19th century, were added to the listed buildings register in 1966. Organisation Woodleigh School was part of the York Boarding Schools Group. It was owned by Woodleigh School Langton Limited, which also operated Langton Hall Language School on the same site. Curriculum Woodleigh School Woodleigh School had a Learning Support Department with a specialist teacher for pupils with dyslexia and dyscalculia. In March 2012 Woodleigh was recommended by First Eleven magazine for the \\"Teaching of special educational needs within a mainstream setting.\\" Music was augmented by a band and choir. Pupils were prepared for academic and music scholarships. Emphasis was placed on the creative arts, in the form of drama, literature, writing, both in the classroom and by organising and taking part in regional and national events such as Youth Speaks and the Kids Lit Quiz.

It owes its heritage to the early development of the instruction set by Sophie Wilson. Part of this heritage is still visible in the provision of a Tube BBC Micro model in ARMulator. Features ARMulator is written in C and provides more than just an instruction set simulator, it provides a virtual platform for system emulation. It comes ready to emulate an ARM processor and certain ARM coprocessors. If the processor is part of an embedded system, then licensees may extend ARMulator to add their own implementations of the additional hardware to the ARMulator model. ARMulator provides a number of services to help with the time-based behaviour and event scheduling and ships with examples of memory mapped and co-processor expansions. This way, they can use ARMulator to emulate their entire embedded system. A key limitation for ARMulator is that it can only simulate a single ARM CPU at one time, although almost all ARM cores up to ARM11 are available. Performance of ARMulator is good for the technology employed, it's about 1000 host (PC) instructions per ARM instruction. This means that emulated speeds of 1 MHz were normal for PCs of the mid to late 90s. Accuracy is good too, although it is classed as cycle count accurate rather than cycle accurate, this is because the ARM pipeline isn't fully modeled (although register interlocks are). Resolution is to an instruction, as a consequence when single stepping the register interlocks are ignored and different cycle counts are returned than if the program had simply run, this was unavoidable. Testing ARMulator was always a time-consuming challenge, the full ARM architecture validation suites being employed. At over 1 million lines of C code it was a fairly hefty product. ARMulator allows runtime debugging using either armsd (ARM Symbolic Debugger), or either of the graphical debuggers that were shipped in SDT and the later ADS products. ARMulator suffered from being an invisible tool with a text file configuration (armul.conf) that many found complex to configure. ARMulator II formed the basis for the high accuracy, cycle callable co-verification models of ARM processors, these CoVs models (see Cycle Accurate Simulator) were the basis of many CoVerification systems for ARM processors. Availability ARMulator was available on a very broad range of platforms through its life, including Mac, RISC OS platforms, DEC Alpha, HP-UX, Solaris, SunOS, Windows, Linux. In the mid-1990s there was reluctance to support Windows platforms; pre-Windows 95 it was a relatively challenging platform. Through the late 1990s and early 2000s support was removed for all but Solaris, Windows and Linux - although undoubtedly the code base remains littered with pragmas such as #ifdef RISCOS. ARMulator II shipped in early ARM toolkits as well as the later SDT 2.5, SDT 2.5.1, ADS 1.0, ADS 1.1, ADS 1.2, RCVT 1.0 and also separately as RVISS. Special models were produced during the development of CPUs, notably the ARM9E, ARM10 and ARM11, these models helped with architectural decisions such as Thumb-2 and TrustZone. ARMulator has been gradually phased out and has been replaced by Just-in-time compilation-based high performance CPU and system models (See FastSim link below). ARMulator I was made open source and is the basis for the GNU version of ARMulator. Key differences are in the memory interface and services, also the instruction decode is done differently. The GNU ARMulator is available as part of the GDB debugger in the ARM GNU Tools. ARMulator II formed the basis for the high accuracy, cycle callable co-verification models of ARM processors, these CoVs models (see Cycle Accurate Simulator) were the basis of many CoVerification systems for ARM processors. Mentor Graphic's Seamless have the market leading CoVs system that supports many ARM cores, and many other CPUs. ARMulator II shipped in early ARM toolkits as well as the later SDT 2.5, SDT 2.5.1, ADS 1.0, ADS 1.1, ADS 1.2, RVCT 1.0 and also separately as RVISS. Key contributors to ARMulator II were Mike Williams, Louise Jameson, Charles Lavender, Donald Sinclair, Chris Lamb and Rebecca Bryan (who worked on ARMulator as both an engineer and later as product manager). Significant input was also made by Allan Skillman, who was working on ARM CoVerification models at the time. A key contributor to ARMulator I was Dave Jaggar. Special models were produced during the development of CPUs, notably the ARM9E, ARM10 and ARM11, these models helped with architectural decisions such as Thumb-2 and TrustZone.

Albert Lamorisse used his ten-year-old son Pascal as the main character in the film. Plot The film tells the story of Pascal, a small child who's fascinated by his grandfather's lighter-than-air balloon. The older man claims he's invented the best mode of transportation: a balloon that can be controlled when in the sky. The altitude, direction, and speed of the balloon are all under the direction of the pilot. As the grand-p√®re takes the balloon on a demonstration, Pascal climbs on board and lifts them both upward to an adventure. The balloon travels all around France, Brittany, over the ocean, and over Mont Blanc in the Alps. However, the balloon turns out to be not so controllable: church spires become objects of threat, factory smokestacks become volcano-like, a stag hunt is no longer about the thrill of the chase, and they inadvertently kidnap washing on a clothesline and a guest at a wedding party in Brittany. The land-bound adults have conniptions as the balloon wafts by, yet, Pascal has a great time.

Bob Hilton was the host, later replaced by Don Galloway. The announcer was Charlie O'Donnell who was then later replaced by Tony McClay. One of the show's producers was Bob Eubanks. Gameplay Three contestants were asked to predict if a live, record-breaking stunt could be performed or broken by guessing if they would succeed or fail. Each player began with $1,000 and could bet up to 90% of what they had. The player with the most money after three rounds kept it and played for a bonus prize by predicting whether the final stunt would succeed or fail. A player who placed a maximum bet on each stunt, and was correct all three times, would win $6,859. All stunts that were completed successfully were entered into the next installment of The Guinness Book of World Records, hence the name of the show. Two of the program's musical cues were recycled from other shows: one was the theme to The Money Maze and the other was Bean Bag, which is also the theme to the UK game show It's A Knockout. The show featured long time WABI-TV (Bangor, Maine) sportscaster Tim Throckmorton. He attempted to break the world coin snatching record. Closings The Guinness Game is notable for the host's unprecedented sign-off: Hilton and Galloway both normally ended each episode by saying \\"We hope you join us when The Guinness Game returns in exactly 167 hours, 31 minutes and 15 seconds...and you can bet on that!\\" (the figures used varied with each airing); the length given translates to seven days minus 30 minutes, a unique way of saying \\"See you next week\\".

Built in 1923, it was the laboratory of astronomer George Ellery Hale (1868-1938), a pioneering figure in the development of the discipline of astrophysics in the United States. The building, a distinctive blend of Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival styles, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. Description The Hale Solar Laboratory is located in a residential area south of the campus of the California Institute of Technology, on the east side of Holladay Road between Lombardy and Orlando Roads. It is set well back from the street, down a narrow tree-lined lane. It is a roughly T-shaped concrete structure, with a tile roof. The stem of the T consists of the telescope tower and Hale's library/office and living area, while the top portion of the T historically housed electrical and ventilation equipment. The main entrance is at the base of the tower, set in an arch above which is an incised bas-relief tribute to Akhenaten, the Egyptian pharaoh who worshipped the sun god Aten. History The observatory was designed by Reginald Davis Johnson (1882 - 1952), Gordon Kaufmann (1888‚Äì1949), and Roland Coate (1890-1958) and was completed in 1923.Pacific Coast Architecture Database: Hale Solar Laboratory, Pasadena, CA The site's landscape master plan and gardens were designed by Beatrix Farrand. After retiring as director at the Mount Wilson Observatory, George Ellery Hale built the Hale Solar Laboratory as his office and workshop, pursuing his interest in the sun. The observatory was where Hale refined the spectrohelioscope, making it possible to perform detailed observations of the surface of the sun. Hale's other wide-ranging contributions to the sciences include the founding of the International Astronomical Union, the Astrophysical Journal, and instrumental contributions to the founding of the California Institute of Technology.

She was the first Black woman to enlist, and the only documented woman to serve in the United States Army posing as a man. Early life Williams was born in Independence, Missouri, to a free man and a woman in slavery, making her legal status also that of a slave. During her adolescence, Williams worked as a house slave on the Johnson plantation on the outskirts of Jefferson City, Missouri. In 1861 Union forces occupied Jefferson City in the early stages of the Civil War. At that time, captured slaves were officially designated by the Union as \\"contraband,\\" and many were forced to serve in military support roles such as cooks, laundresses, or nurses. American Civil War It is possible that Cathay Williams was present at the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Red River Campaign. There is no evidence, however, that supports any claims to her service in the Civil War, although a soldier named \\"Finis Cathay\\" did enlist in the 32nd Missouri Infantry as early as 1862 and participated in most of the major campaigns in the west, including the Siege of Vicksburg and Sherman's March to the Sea, before helping to force Joseph E. Johnston's last Confederate army into surrender in North Carolina. This unit's history parallels many of the wartime stories told of Cathay Williams, including its presence in Washington, D.C., at the final Grand Review on May 24, 1865. U.S. Army service Despite the prohibition against women serving in the military, Cathay Williams enlisted in the United States Regular Army under the false name of \\"William Cathay\\" on November 15, 1866, at St. Louis, Missouri, for a three-year engagement, passing herself off as a man. She was assigned to the 38th United States Infantry Regiment after she passed a cursory medical examination. Only two others are known to have been privy to the deception, her cousin and a friend, both of whom were fellow soldiers in her regiment. Shortly after her enlistment, Williams contracted smallpox, was hospitalized and rejoined her unit, which by then was posted in New Mexico. Possibly due to the effects of smallpox, the New Mexico heat, or the cumulative effects of years of marching, her body began to show signs of strain. She was frequently hospitalized. The post surgeon finally discovered she was a woman, and informed the post commander. She was discharged from the Army by her commanding officer, Captain Charles E. Clarke, on October 14, 1868. Post- military service years Cathay Williams went to work as a cook at Fort Union, New Mexico, and later moved to Pueblo, Colorado. Williams married, but it ended disastrously when her husband stole her money and a team of horses. Williams had him arrested. She next moved to Trinidad, Colorado, where she made her living as a seamstress. She may also have owned a boarding house. It was at this time that Williams' story first became public. A reporter from St. Louis heard rumors of an African-American woman who had served in the army, and came to interview her. Her life and military service narrative was published in The St. Louis Daily Times on January 2, 1876. U.S. Army Pension records for Cathay Williams In late 1889 or early 1890, Cathay Williams entered a local hospital where she remained for some time, and in June 1891, applied for a disability pension based on her military service. The nature of her illness and disability are unknown. There was precedent for granting a pension to female soldiers. Deborah Sampson in 1816, Anna Maria Lane, and Mary Hayes McCauley (better known as Molly Pitcher) had been granted pensions for their service in the American Revolutionary War. Declining health and death In September 1893, a doctor employed by the U.S. Pension Bureau examined Cathay Williams. Despite the fact that she suffered from neuralgia and diabetes, she had all her toes amputated, and could only walk with a crutch, the doctor decided she did not qualify for disability payments. Her application was rejected.Voices of the Buffalo Soldier: Records, reports, and recollections of military life and service in the West. Edited by Frank N. Schubert. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2003, p. 33. The exact date of Williams' death is unknown, but it is assumed she died shortly after being denied a pension, probably sometime in 1893. Her simple grave marker would have been made of wood and deteriorated long ago. Thus her final resting place is now unknown. Honors In 2016, a bronze bust of Cathay Williams, featuring information about her and with a small rose garden around it, was unveiled outside the Richard Allen Cultural Center in Leavenworth, Kansas. In 2018, the Private Cathay Williams monument bench was unveiled on the Walk of Honor at the National Infantry Museum.

Wolf (born Alice Koerner, December 24, 1933) is an American politician. She served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1996 to 2013, representing the 25th Middlesex District. On March 22, 2012, Wolf announced that she would not seek re-election. Her term ended in January 2013. She previously served on the Cambridge, Massachusetts School Committee and Cambridge City Council Cambridge City Council, Massachusetts#Government, as the Mayor of Cambridge, as the mayor from 1990 to 1991.List of mayors of Cambridge Early years Wolf was born to a Jewish family in 1933 in Vienna, Austria. Her parents, Frederick (Fritz) and Renee Koerner, fled Nazi persecution in 1938, bringing the family to Brighton, Massachusetts. The first school that Wolf attended was the Baldwin Early Learning Center, which is still running in Brighton, Massachusetts. She attended high school at Boston Girls Latin School, now Boston Latin Academy. She graduated from Simmons College (Massachusetts) in 1955 with a degree in Experimental Psychology. In the same year she and her husband, Robert Wolf were married. The Wolfs settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts where they raised a family. She later earned a master's degree in public administration at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Early career Alice Wolf‚Äôs career started at M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory where she conducted perceptual research by programming the Memory Test Computer to display dot patterns to human subjects. Later, she co-authored a paper \\"Baseball: An Automated Question Answerer\\" which described an early attempt at natural language database queries. The paper was translated into Chinese and Russian. After Lincoln Laboratory, Wolf worked at Bolt Beranek and Newman as well as Computer Corporation of America, which was later acquired by Rocket Software. Alice Wolf‚Äôs path to civic engagement and elective office began with participation in the Parent-Teacher Association of the Peabody School in Cambridge, where her sons were students. Deep involvement as a parent with school affairs ultimately led to her election in 1974 as a member of the Cambridge School Committee, where she served from January 1974 through January 1982. Initial Public Service Career Alice Wolf began her long career in public service when she was elected in 1974 as a member of the Cambridge School Committee, where she served from January 1974 through January 1982. While on the School Committee, she championed community involvement in decision-making (such as the hiring of school principals), was lauded for crafting the first plan for racial desegregation of the city‚Äôs schools, and provided leadership in the siting of the city‚Äôs high school, the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. In 1981, near the end of her fourth term on the School Committee, she felt that her efforts to bring about social equality would be better spent on the Cambridge City Council. She ran for the Council in 1981, but narrowly missed a win in a crowded field of 25 candidates. Cambridge Civic Journal In 1983, she again ran for election to the Cambridge City Council and was successful. She joined the Council in January 1984. Cambridge Civic Journal On the Cambridge City Council Wolf‚Äôs accomplishments on the Cambridge City Council included the establishment and passage of a number of key laws. In 1984, she sponsored the Cambridge Human Rights Ordinance, that protects Cambridge residents from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, as well as other protected classes. Wolf also led the city initiative to create a domestic partners ordinance, and establish the commission to enforce the ordinance. Wolf was the sponsor of the first Mayor's Gay Pride Breakfast, which has become an annual Cambridge event. At a subsequent Gay Pride Breakfast, she was named an \\"honorary lesbian.\\" In the 1980s, in conjunction with the Cambridge Peace Commission, she created a \\"peace curriculum,\\" a program of peace education for the public schools, K-12, to assist teachers in assuring kids of all ages could develop a constructive approach to resolving differences and disputes. Wolf led marches and did research to support \\"economic conversion,\\" trying to convince local companies to convert military-focused enterprises into peace-oriented activities. She developed Sister City relationships, a model for international cooperation at the grassroots level, with San Jos√© Las Flores, Chalatenango, El Salvador and Yerevan, Armenia. Wolf led the effort to make Cambridge a Sanctuary City, where persecuted people fleeing tyranny and death in their countries of origin could come when they were not given political asylum in the U.S. Wolf worked with the Cambridge Peace Commission and others to hold a yearly Cambridge Holocaust Commemoration, support Armenia (through the Cambridge-Yerevan sister city relationship) after the 1988 earthquake, continue nurturing the connection with the residents of San Jose Las Flores, El Salvador, and to bring together Cambridge people of diverse backgrounds to support our Muslim neighbors after 9/11. Wolf led in the creation of the Cambridge Kids Council, which is dedicated to developing policy recommendations and programs aimed at improving the quality of life for children, youth and families in Cambridge. The Cambridge City Council is elected by Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote system. After inauguration, the Mayor is selected by the elected members of the city council. Alice Wolf served as the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts from January 1990 to January 1992. She was elected five times to the Council, serving from 1984 through 1994. Scheme Z Alice Wolf led Cambridge in its opposition to Scheme Z, the widely criticized proposed interchange for the planned Big Dig highway project. Scheme Z would have added additional miles of loop ramps to the interchange. Wolf successfully worked to get Cambridge to file a lawsuit in order to stop this aspect of the plan from going forward. As a State Representative In the fall of 1996, Wolf successfully ran for a seat on the Massachusetts House of Representatives, defeating Anthony Galluccio in the Democratic Primary by 89 votes. She was reelected in subsequent terms and served in the Massachusetts legislature for 16 years. As a legislator, Representative Alice Wolf served as the House Chair of the Committee on Elder Affairs and on the Women‚Äôs Legislative Caucus. She has been recognized for her advocacy through numerous honors and awards including the Executive Office of Health and Human Services Department of Mental Health 2010 Certificate of Appreciation; the 2009 School-Based Health Center Legislative Champion Award; the 2007 NOW Legislator of the Year; the 2007 Byron Rushing Freedom of Religion Award from the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry; the 2006 Massachusetts Family Planning Association Leadership Award; the 2005 Champions of Children Award from Massachusetts Advocates for Children; and the 2005 Early Education Leadership Award from the Massachusetts Association of Community Partnerships for Children. Alice Wolf worked on many progressive issues and on countless bills. Her many constituents saw Rep. Wolf as their champion on a range of issues, and she was regarded as one of the most progressive legislators in the State House. During her tenure, she worked to promote gender equality, GLBT rights, marriage equality, minority and immigrant rights, environmental causes, education, health care, reproductive rights, affordable housing, education and senior issues. She served as the House Chair of the Committee on Elder Affairs and of the Women‚Äôs Legislative Caucus. Wolf‚Äôs perseverance and hard work on behalf of those she represented was widely recognized. When faced with barriers to progressive legislation, she identified allies, worked within coalitions, and created strategies to move forward. She was willing to work tirelessly to move the mountains of legislative bureaucracy on issues she cares about. Alice Wolf worked closely with activists and other leaders in their efforts to ensure that the Supreme Judicial Court‚Äôs decision Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, which legalized same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, was not the subject of a public referendum. As a House whip, she persuaded legislators to vote against bringing the matter before a legislative constitutional convention, championing the position that human rights should not be determined by popular vote. Bottle Bill Wolf‚Äôs legislative legacy includes her work to update the state‚Äôs bottle bill See Container deposit legislation in the United States. Under her leadership, the Bottle Bill Update became the most talked-about environmental bill of recent years. The Bottle Bill Update passed the Senate in 2012, but was not passed by the House. As of September 13, 2013, efforts were underway to update the Massachusetts Bottle Bill through a statewide ballot initiative.

KMAJ is a news/talk station that is owned by Cumulus Media. History KMAJ signed on the air in July 1947 as KJAY, featuring a blend of middle-of-the-road (MOR) music and news. In March 1962 Fred Reynolds, dba Midland Broadcasters, Inc., acquired KJAY. He immediately changed the call letters to KEWI and the format to Top-40, bringing in some of Gordon McLendon's \\"Raiders\\" (high-energy DJs) to make a big splash on \\"Big KeeWee\\". By the late 1960s these \\"KeeWee Good Guys\\" had made KEWI the city's top-rated station. The weekly Top 20+20 Tunedex survey evolved into a Fab 40 Tunedex to go with the British Invasion and then to a Top 14+40 Tunedex to match its dial position at 1440 kHz. By September 1980, the station had changed format to country music and was using the slogan \\"Kix Country\\" with the call letters KSKX. Then, to capitalize on the popularity of the \\"Retro\\" craze, the KEWI call letters came back in November 1986. By 1990 contemporary music had moved to the FM dial and AM was talk-oriented. So KEWI changed call letters to KMAJ (Magic) along with its sister FM. Cumulus bought the station from Midland Broadcasters in February 1999 and began simulcasting syndicated talk shows and programming with KMBZ radio in Kansas City.

Short of some sporadic surprise wins versus higher-ranked countries, mostly on home soil, the national team has not enjoyed any success of note. On the other hand, Cypriot clubs have reached the Champions League Group Stage three times in recent years; that has made Cyprus the smallest sovereign state (in both terms of area and population) to have been represented in the main phase of Europe's most prestigious club tournament, since the introduction of the group stage in 1992. APOEL FC made history by being the first Cypriot team to reach the quarter finals of UEFA Champions League in 2012, and by reaching the last 16 of the UEFA Europa League in 2017. The recent successes of APOEL FC team, both in the domestic championship and in Europe, have made it the most successful and most numerous club in Cyprus. Moreover, the national association has organised various FIFA and UEFA events (tournaments, courses, meetings). History Football was introduced to Cyprus early in the 20th century by the British (Canon Frank Darvall Newham, founder of The English School, Nicosia). Initially played in the island's schools, it proved hugely popular and a number of clubs were duly formed. Football clubs played friendly games only and the first unofficial island-wide league was organised on 1932. The rivalry between teams that support different political parties has grown intense over the decades and the matches result in bloody conflicts between the fans. The fans take extreme pride in their team not only because the history of their team but because the connection their political party has with their team. The more hardcore right wing fans were waved before fascist symbols during matches whereas the hardcore left wing fans wave symbols associated with communism. AC Omonia's hardcore fans in the season 2011-2012 made an enormous choreography of the hammer and sickle, whereas APOEL FC and other right wing football clubs have waved fascist symbols in the past. The two teams mentioned above have an often violent rivalry, resulting in injuries to fans. Cyprus Football Association As football became established, the clubs were united in agreeing that an official body was needed to regulate the sport. In September 1934, the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) was formed and matches were soon being played on an official basis. The association became a FIFA member in 1948 and an UEFA member in 1962. Pancyprian Footballers Association Until the mid-1980s, footballers in Cyprus did not have any organisation or union that promoted their interests. Players were usually paid small wages and needed to have other jobs in order to support themselves and their families. On December 12, 1987 the Pancyprian Footballers Association () was created. On February 25, 1997, the PFA became a FIFPro member. There are 52,403 (19,203 registered) players and 108 football clubs in Cyprus. League system The governing body of football in Cyprus is the Cyprus Football Association. The first official league was organised in 1934. The Cyprus Football Association oversees the organization of: * Leagues: ** Cypriot First Division ** Cypriot Second Division ** Cypriot Third Division ** STOK Elite Division * Cup tournaments: ** Cypriot Cup ** Cypriot Super Cup ** Cypriot Cup for lower divisions * National teams: ** Cyprus national football team ** Cyprus national under-21 football team Teams National team The Cypriot national team has yet to qualify for any major FIFA or UEFA competition, but it has been improving in recent qualifying tournaments.

Based on Max Catto's 1954 novel with the same title, the picture was made by Warwick Films on location in Trinidad and Tobago, in Technicolor and CinemaScope, and released by Columbia Pictures. Plot After the Korean War, Americans Tony (Lemmon) and Felix (Mitchum) own a tramp boat, the Ruby, which they use for small-scale smuggling around the Caribbean, along with a third crewman, Jimmy Jean (Edric Connor). One day, their bartender contact, Miguel (Anthony Newley), introduces them to an American businessman who has been enjoying the company of beautiful but passport-less European goddess Irena (Hayworth). He has to return to Detroit, but wants to arrange for her to get to another island. They are reluctant, but $1,200 proves very tempting. On the voyage, Tony starts falling in love with her. Knowing the kind of woman she is, Felix does his best to protect his partner by warning Irena to stay away from Tony. However, Felix starts falling for her himself. When she disembarks, Tony goes with her, ending his partnership with Felix. Tony and Jimmy Jean take on a shady job, but are intercepted by the authorities. They have to abandon ship and swim to a nearby island to avoid arrest. Tony takes a job on a cargo ship to get back to Irena. He also plans to kill Felix, correctly suspecting that his former partner tipped off the customs agents to get rid of the competition for Irena. However, while Tony is away, she goes to Felix and confesses she loves him. After a collision, Tony is trapped below deck under a girder with time running out; the ship is aflame and carrying a highly explosive cargo. Doctor Sam Blake (Bernard Lee) offers the only way out, by amputating Tony's trapped legs, but he would rather die. Felix goes aboard and stays with him. An explosion frees Tony from the wreckage, and Felix carries him to safety. After Tony has recovered, he confronts Felix and Irena in a bar. It is there he realises that Irena loves Felix and not him, leaving him to walk away and cut his losses by saying, \\"some days you win, some days you lose\\".

In 1994, the State of California recognized the Gabrieli√±o-Tongva Tribe in Assembly Joint Resolution 96, Resolution Chapter 146 of the Statutes of 1994; however, it has no state-recognized tribes today. The tribe, however, has broken into several factions, some of whom are seeking federal recognition as separate tribes. The three largest and most prominent factions are: **Gabrieli√±o-Tongva Tribe (or the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians, as it was historically referred to) **Gabriele√±o/Tongva Tribal Council of San Gabrieltongva.com **Gabriele√±o/Tongva Nation (a.k.a. Gabrieli√±o/Tongva Tribe of the Los Angeles Basin). :In past years, bills have been introduced in the California legislature to create a Gabrieli√±o-Tongva Reservation for the tribe and grant the tribe gaming rights; however, these bills failed to make it to the Governor's desk. In their most recent attempt, Senate Bill 1134 introduced on January 30, 2008 would have created the Gabrieli√±o/Tongva Reservation without giving the tribe gaming rights. However, when the principal author, Senator Oropeza, found out that the tribe would use the reservation for leverage to obtain gaming rights, she pulled her sponsorship of the bill. *Honey Lake Maidu.

They did not submit a documented petition until April 23, 1990. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on June 15, 1990 responded with a letter outlining the deficiencies in the petition. During the process, it repeatedly offered to have representatives meet with the tribe to review avenues of research, specifically court records and land deeds, for the period 1750-1820 in which records are scarce. The RMI submitted a partial response on January 28, 1991. A fully revised petition was determined to be ready for active consideration on March 5, 1992. The petition was placed on active consideration status on July 14, 1992. In December 1993, the BIA issued its proposed finding, rejecting the tribe's petition. It granted the tribe an opportunity to respond, including extensions. It issued its Final Determination rejecting its petition on December 11, 1995. This survived an internal BIA appeal in 1997 and a federal court appeal in 2001. *Unalachtigo Band of Nanticoke Lenni Lenape Nation.

He is regarded as one of the first explorers of the high mountains of the Pyrenees who can be described as a pyreneist.Henri B√©raldi, A Hundred years in the Pyrenees, reprinting by the friends of the Pyrenean Book, Pau, 1977, volume 1. Life Louis Ramond de Carbonni√®res Louis Ramond was born in Strasbourg, to Pierre-Bernard Ramond (1715‚Äì1796), treasurer of war, and Rosalie-Reine Eisentrand (1732‚Äì1762). He studied law at the University of Strasbourg in 1775 and became a lawyer in February 1777. In Strasbourg he became friends with another student, Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1751‚Äì1792), a writer belonging to the then-fashionable Sturm und Drang movement. During this period Ramond discovered German Romantic literature, in particular Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther; this book inspired him to become a writer and in 1777 he published the Werther- influenced Les Derni√®res aventures du jeune d‚ÄôOlban (The Last Adventures of Young Olban). Ramond undertook a voyage to Switzerland in May 1777 where he met writers and poets, as well as scientists: the theologian Johann Kaspar Lavater (1741‚Äì1801), and the zoologists Albrecht von Haller (1708‚Äì1777) and Charles Bonnet (1720‚Äì1793); he also came across his friend Lenz there. The two men shared what was by all accounts an ecstatic experience contemplating the valley of the Rhine. Ramond also caught the passion for high mountains. A few days later, Lenz suffered his first bout of insanity. In 1778, Ramond published √âl√©gies, impressions inspired by his love for nature. Extracts from this work were published the same year in the Journal de Dames of Claude- Joseph Dorat (1734‚Äì1780). In 1779, Ramond and his father settled in Paris. In 1780, Ramond published La Guerre d‚ÄôAlsace pendant le Grand Schisme d‚ÄôOccident (The War of Alsace during the Great Western Schism), a romantic and historical epic. But the French capital was not yet ready for German Romanticism and the book was not received as well as he had hoped. Louis Ren√© √âdouard de Rohan Leaving Paris he returned to Strasbourg, where he placed himself at the service of cardinal Louis Ren√© √âdouard de Rohan (1734‚Äì1803), prince of Rohan- Guemen√©e and cardinal-archbishop of Strasbourg, celebrated for his role in the affair of the diamond necklace. In the company of the prince, Ramond travelled widely and met many of the personalities of the age. The cardinal was sent in exile to La Chaise-Dieu in June 1786, and he left for Auvergne accompanied by his faithful secretary. That summer, the cardinal wished to stay in a thermal town in the Pyrenees and Ramond departed to reconnoitre the area. The two men spent the summer and the autumn of 1787 in Bar√®ges. Ramond started to explore the nearby mountains above Gavarnie and in the Maladetta Massif, to get a better acquaintance with their geological formations ‚Äì these were the subject of a topical controversy, fed in particular by the limestone theories of D√©odat Gratet de Dolomieu (1750‚Äì1801) ‚Äì and to see whether the mountains were granite or limestone, which was believed to be older rock. When the cardinal was authorized to return to Strasbourg in December 1788, Ramond settled in Paris, where in 1789 he published his Observations faites dans les Pyr√©n√©es, pour servir de suite √† des observations sur les Alpes (Observations Made in the Pyrenees, To follow some Observations of the Alps). To improve his knowledge of natural history, he followed the courses of Jussieu (1748‚Äì1836) and Ren√© Desfontaines (1780‚Äì1831) in the Jardin des Plantes. Cilindro de Marbor√© (3,328 m), Monte Perdido (3,355 m) and Soum de Ramond (3,263 m) (left to right) He also launched himself into politics, being elected a deputy of Paris in September 1791 and joining the Club des Feuillants. In 1792 he defended the refractory priests whose deportation had been voted for. Ramond passionately supported the action of La Fayette, who tried to temper the over- enthusiasm of the Jacobins. His life in danger, Ramond decided to flee Paris in August and seek refuge in the Pyrenees. Under surveillance and regarded as suspect, he left for Bar√®ges, where he was able to indulge in his botanizing and mountain observations to his heart‚Äôs content. He was arrested in 1794 and accused of being an enemy of the Revolution. Imprisoned in Tarbes for seven months, his was a lucky escape from the guillotine. From 1796 he devoted himself exclusively to natural history. He corresponded with Philippe Picot of Lapeyrouse (1744‚Äì1818) and various botanists such as Ren√© Desfontaines, Jean Thore (1762‚Äì1823) and Domenica Villars (1745‚Äì1814). From 1796, he taught as professor of natural history at the new Central School of Tarbes,Le dictionnaire des Pyr√©n√©es, encyclop√©die France-Espagne, sous la direction d'Andr√© L√©vy, √âditions Privat, Toulouse, 1999. where his courses were an immediate success, and he soon became a specialist in the botany and geology of the central Pyrenees. In 1797, he was finally able to concentrate on a project which had long intrigued him: to reach the top of Monte Perdido (3,355 m) to counter the theories of Dolomieu and Lapeyrouse on the 'early era' of the limestone of the central chain. The expedition, which comprised about fifteen people, including Picot of Lapeyrouse and several of Ramond's pupils, found many fossils, but did not reach the top. The account of the expedition appeared in 1797 under the title of Voyage au Mont-Perdu et dans la partie adjacente des Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es (Voyage to Monte Perdido and the neighbouring parts of the High Pyrenees). On 7 September the same year, again accompanied by his pupils and Charles-Fran√ßois Brisseau de Mirbel (1776‚Äì1854), Ramond made a second attempt. The administrator and forester √âtienne-Fran√ßois Dralet (1760‚Äì1844) also took part in the expedition. But it was only in 1802 that he reached finally the top. Ramond reported this ascent in the Journal de Mines (in Thermidor year XI). He corresponded in particular with Ren√© Just Ha√ºy (1743‚Äì1822), Alexandre Brongniart (1770‚Äì1847) and Jean Florimond Boudon de Saint-Mercy (1748‚Äì1831). After the Central School of Tarbes closed, he returned to Paris in 1800 as a member of the Constitutional Council. From 1800 to 1806, he worked with the Parliament, as well as taking part in the work of the Soci√©t√© des observateurs de l'homme and becoming a member of the French Academy of Sciences in January 1802. He married Bonne-Olympe in 1805, widow of General Louis-Nicolas Ch√©rin and the daughter of his friend Bon-Joseph Dacier (1742‚Äì1833). As a friend of Napoleon, Ramond was named vice-president of the Corps l√©gislatif, then in 1806 he became prefect of Puy-de-D√¥me. He spent more time, however, botanizing and making weather measurements than occupying himself with administration. This did not prevent his being made baron d'Empire in December 1809. In 1815 he published Nivellement des Monts Dor√©s et des Monts D√¥mes dispos√© par ordre de terrains, (Stratification of the Monts Dor√©s and the Monts D√¥mes). The same year, he was elected deputy of Puy-de- D√¥me. In 1818 he was elected to the Conseil d'√âtat and did not leave Paris again except to go to Auvergne. In 1821, he spent the summer in Auvergne with Ren√© Desfontaines and two young naturalists, Victor Jacquemont (1801‚Äì1832) and Count Hippolyte Jaubert (1798‚Äì1874). He published finally, in 1825, Sur l‚Äô√©tat de la v√©g√©tation au sommet du Pic du Midi, (On the Condition of the Vegetation on the Summit of the Pic du Midi), this being the Pic du Midi de Bigorre, not its more shapely namesake. On his death in 1827 Ramond was buried in the cemetery of Montmartre.

It wanted to distinguish itself from traditional academic societies, while still being devoted primarily to the scientific and ethnographic study of the Pyrenees and to the dissemination of knowledge. Ramond, who had excelled in these disciplines, was the best symbol for the new society. The Ramond Society still publishes an annual bulletin. *Ramond's herbarium can be seen at the Mus√©um de l'histoire naturelle in Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre.

History The 7th General Convention of the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party which was held in Constan≈£a, Romania, in 1913, had a unique and great importance not only for the Hunchaks, but in the history of the Armenian people as a whole. During the Convention, members stressed their concern of the Ittihad (Young Turk) government's blatant disregard of the Armenian lives who resided in Historic Armenia. The Hunchaks feared that this disregard would only escalate as time passed. The Hunchaks also stressed the importance of a United Independent Armenia which would be impossible under the racist and dictatorial Young Turk government's rule of the Ottoman Empire. Thus the convention adjourned with two main objectives: > I - As stated in its original program, the party was to move from licit to > illicit activities, thus becoming once again a covert organization. II - To > plan and assassinate the leaders of the Ittihad (Young Turk) party, the same > leaders that carried out the Adana massacres of 1909, and thus the same > leaders who at that moment were planning the annihilation of the Armenian > people. However, these secret objectives were passed on to the Ottomans by an agent; consequently as soon as the delegates arrived in Constantinople, they were arrested. By the end of the year a total of one hundred and forty Hunchak leaders were arrested. The 20 Gallows After spending two years in terrible conditions in Ottoman prisons, and undergoing lengthy mock trials, twenty prominent figures - Paramaz, Dr. Benne, Aram Achekbashian, Vanig and others were sentenced to death by hanging. A few weeks after the beginning of the Armenian Genocide on June 15, 1915, all twenty men were hanged in the central square of Constantinople, known as Sultan Bayazid Square. Paramaz's last words before his hanging were, \\"You can only hang our bodies, but not our ideology. ...You will see tomorrow on the Eastern horizon a Socialist Armenia.\\"\\"Tchahakir\\" Armenian weekly, # 1594, June 21, 2007, Cairo, p.3 List of the hanged Hunchakians The names are written according to the writer and publisher Teotig.Teotig (Teotoros Lap√ßinciyan): ‘≥’∏’≤’£’∏’©’° ’∞’°’µ ’∞’∏’£’•÷Ç’∏÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂’∏÷Ç’©’•’°’∂ [The Golgotha of the Armenian Clergy], H.

According to Zarutsky, Lipatov drove him to Filin's home where he threw the acid in Filin's face. Following the confession, a spokesman from the Russian Interior Ministry stated that investigators considered the case closed. By 7 March, all three men confessed to the crime. Dmitrichenko confessed to arranging the attack, but maintained that he had not instructed the two men to use acid. The attack came after a lengthy period of infighting and rows within the Bolshoi Ballet Company. Various motives have been presented by Russian police officials, primarily focusing on \\"personal hostile relations linked to their professional activities\\". Russia's television news and tabloid journalists surmised that Dmitrichenko was angry when Filin chose another dancer rather than Dmitrichenko's girlfriend, ballerina Anzhelina Vorontsova (ru) to portray Princess Odette, also known as the Swan Queen in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Dmitrichenko stated during a bail hearing that he was frustrated with the inequitable and \\"unjust\\" allocation of funds distributed to dancers in the company. When he voiced his frustration, Zarutsky suggested that they \\"beat up\\" Filin. In the courtroom, the judge questioned Dmitrichenko whether or not he would like to apologize to Filin. Dmitrichenko defiantly responded with \\"For what?\\" At that point, the judge denied bail, which resulted in incarceration for six weeks, while investigators and attorneys prepared for the trial. The three men who confessed to the crime faced a maximum sentence of 12 years. Dmitrichenko was sentenced to six years in prison, but he was released early for good behavior in May 2016 after serving just three years in prison. In October 2016, Dmitrichenko was granted a building pass to the Bolshoi Theater, and returned for morning exercises.

This is 1 less than the dimension of the section ring of L :R(X, L) = \\\\bigoplus_{d=0}^\\\\infty H^0(X, L^{\\\\otimes d}). The Iitaka dimension of L is always less than or equal to the dimension of X. If L is not effective, then its Iitaka dimension is usually defined to be -\\\\infty or simply said to be negative (some early references define it to be ‚àí1). The Iitaka dimension of L is sometimes called L-dimension, while the dimension of a divisor D is called D-dimension. The Iitaka dimension was introduced by . Big line bundles A line bundle is big if it is of maximal Iitaka dimension, that is, if its Iitaka dimension is equal to the dimension of the underlying variety. Bigness is a birational invariant: If is a birational morphism of varieties, and if L is a big line bundle on X, then f*L is a big line bundle on Y. All ample line bundles are big. Big line bundles need not determine birational isomorphisms of X with its image. For example, if C is a hyperelliptic curve (such as a curve of genus two), then its canonical bundle is big, but the rational map it determines is not a birational isomorphism. Instead, it is a two-to-one cover of the canonical curve of C, which is a rational normal curve. Kodaira dimension The Iitaka dimension of the canonical bundle of a smooth variety is called its Kodaira dimension.  Iitaka conjecture  The m-pluricanonical map of complex manifolds M to W induces a fiber space structure. Consider on complex algebraic varieties in the following. Let K be the canonical bundle on M. The dimension of H0(M,Km), holomorphic sections of Km, is denoted by Pm(M), called m-genus. Let ::N(M)=\\\\\\\\{m\\\\ge1|P_m(M)\\\\ge1\\\\\\\\}, then N(M) becomes to be all of the positive integer with non-zero m-genus. When N(M) is not empty, for m\\\\in N(M) m-pluricanonical map \\\\Phi_{mK} is defined as the map :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi_{mK}: & M\\\\longrightarrow\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbb{P}^N \\\\\\\\\\\\ & z\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mapsto\\\\ \\\\ (\\\\varphi_0(z):\\\\varphi_1(z):\\\\cdots:\\\\varphi_N(z)) \\\\end{align} where \\\\varphi_i are the bases of H0(M,Km). Then the image of \\\\Phi_{mK}, \\\\Phi_{mK}(M) is defined as the submanifold of \\\\mathbb{P}^N. For certain m let \\\\Phi_{mk}:M\\\\rightarrow W=\\\\Phi_{mK}(M)\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^N be the m-pluricanonical map where W is the complex manifold embedded into projective space PN. In the case of surfaces with Œ∫(M)=1 the above W is replaced by a curve C, which is an elliptic curve (Œ∫(C)=0). We want to extend this fact to the general dimension and obtain the analytic fiber structure depicted in the upper right figure. The m-pluricanonical map is birational invariant. Pm(M)=Pm(W) Given a birational map \\\\varphi:M \\\\longrightarrow W, m-pluricanonical map brings the commutative diagram depicted in the left figure, which means that \\\\Phi_{mK}(M)=\\\\Phi_{mK}(W), i.e. m-pluricanonical genus is birationally invariant. thumb|240px|The existence of the birational map œà : Wm1 ‚Üí Wm2 in the projective space It is shown by Iitaka that given n-dimensional compact complex manifold M with its Kodaira dimension Œ∫(M) satisfying 1 ‚â§ Œ∫(M) ‚â§ n-1, there are enough large m1,m2 such that \\\\Phi_{m_1K}:M\\\\longrightarrow W_{m_1}(M) and \\\\Phi_{m_2K}:M\\\\longrightarrow W_{m_2}(M) are birationally equivalent, which means there are the birational map \\\\varphi:W_{m_1}\\\\longrightarrow W_{m_2}(M). Namely, the diagram depicted in the right figure is commutative. Furthermore, one can select M^* that is birational with M and W^* that is birational with both W_{m_1} and W_{m_1} such that :: \\\\Phi : M^* \\\\longrightarrow W^* is birational map, the fibers of \\\\Phi are simply connected and the general fibers of \\\\Phi :: M^*_w:= \\\\Phi^{-1}(w),\\\\ \\\\ w\\\\in W^* have Kodaira dimension 0. The above fiber structure is called the Iitaka fiber space. In the case of the surface S (n = 2 = dim(S)), W* is the algebraic curve, the fiber structure is of dimension 1, and then the general fibers have the Kodaira dimension 0 i.e. elliptic curve. Therefore, S is the elliptic surface. These fact can be generalized to the general n. Therefore The study of the higher-dimensional birational geometry decompose to the part of Œ∫=-‚àû,0,n and the fiber space whose fibers is of Œ∫=0. The following additional formula by Iitaka, called Iitaka conjecture, is important for the classification of algebraic varieties or compact complex manifolds. This conjecture has been only partly solved, for example in the case of Moishezon manifolds. The classification theory might been said to be the effort to solve the Iitaka conjecture and lead another theorems that the three-dimensional variety V is abelian if and only if Œ∫(V)=0 and q(V)=3 and its generalization so on. The minimal model program might be led from this conjecture.

The goal of codeball is to reach the bowl using as few kicks as possible.  History  Codeball was invented in 1929 by a Chicago doctor named William Edward Code, who developed the game for his friend. At the time, Code's friend sought an inexpensive outdoor game suited to large playgrounds. Almost forgotten today, the game reached its peak of popularity in the 1930s.

The force constitutes the second leg of the French nuclear deterrent force. The M1 version went into service in 1971 and was phased out in favour of the M2 in 1974, itself replaced by the M20 in 1977. The new M4 missile entered service in 1985 and has replaced the M-20. French nuclear-powered submarines (SNLE: Sous-marin Nucl√©aire Lanceur d'Engins, \\"Nuclear Device-Launching Submarine\\"), are able to carry 16 missiles each. The oldest ship, Redoutable, was not converted to carry the M-4 and was withdrawn from service in 1991. Logistical support for the MSBS fleet is provided by the √éle Longue Naval Base in Brest Bay, where the assembly and storage facilities for maintenance of readiness are located. Three SSBNs are intended to be operational at any one time. The M20 system entered service in 1977. There were 100 missiles produced, and the M20 ceased operational deployment in 1991. Technical The M-20 was a two-stage, solid propellant, intermediate-range ballistic missile, 10.4 m in length and 1.5 m in diameter. Launch weight was 20,000 kg and the missile had a range of 3,000 km. Control of the first stage was by four gimballed nozzles; the second stage by thrust vector control through a single fixed nozzle. The first stage propellant weighed 10,000 kg and burned for 55 seconds, the second stage propellant weighed 6,015 kg and burned for 58 seconds. Guidance was inertial. The payload was believed to include some penetration aids and the single re- entry vehicle had some hardening against nuclear effects. The TN-60 warhead was reported to yield 1.2 Mt.

As an Associate Justice he served for 16 years, the longest service of any member of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court, and wrote over 150 legal opinions. As Governor he oversaw Arizona's transition from territory to statehood. Background Sloan was born on June 22, 1857 in Morning Sun, Preble County, Ohio, to Mary (Caldwell) and Dr. Richard E. Sloan. His family had moved to Ohio from South Carolina owing to their opposition to the secession movement and slavery. Sloan was educated in private and public schools and graduated from Monmouth College (Illinois) with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1877. Following graduation he taught in a private school for a year. Near the time of his college graduation, one of Sloan's older brothers died of quick consumption. When he developed asthma and hay fever, his family became concerned and sent him to Denver, Colorado hoping the change of climate would provide relief to his symptoms. While in Denver, Sloan worked as a reporter for the Rocky Mountain News. He also worked at several mines near Breckenridge and Leadville, Colorado. From Colorado, Sloan returned to Ohio and earned a Bachelor of Laws from the Cincinnati Law School (now the University of Cincinnati College of Law) in 1882. After graduation he and a friend, Louis H. Chalmers, traveled west, filling in for newspaper editors who wished to take time off from their duties. During the course of their journey they stopped in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Spokane, Washington Territory, Portland, Oregon and San Francisco, California. Arizona Territory While in San Francisco, Sloan suffered a bout of hay fever and asthma, and it was recommended to him that he should try the Arizona climate. Sloan and Chalmers arrived in Phoenix, Arizona Territory in late 1884, and Sloan found the climate relieved his respiratory problems. Sloan was admitted to the territorial bar in January 1885 and opened a private legal practice with Chalmers as his partner. The firm of Sloan & Chalmers lasted until early 1886, when Sloan moved to Florence, Arizona Territory. Sloan was elected to a term as County Attorney for Pinal County, Arizona Territory, running from 1887 to 1889. In 1888 he served as temporary chairman for the territorial Republican convention and was elected to represent Pinal County as a council member in the 15th Arizona Territorial Legislature. Sloan married Mary Brown of Hamilton, Ohio on November 22, 1887. The marriage produced three children: Richard E., who died in childhood, Elanor B. and Mary. In May 1889, Sloan applied to United States Attorney General William H. H. Miller for a position as a judge. He was given a recess appointment to Arizona Territory's 1st district by President Benjamin Harrison in October 1889. The appointment was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 19, 1890. Upon his appointment Sloan moved to Tucson, Arizona Territory, the primary court location for his district. Shortly after taking the bench Sloan drew the anger of Governor Lewis Wolfley when the new judge appointed a personal enemy of the governor, Brewster Cameron, as his court clerk. The governor complained that Sloan was ineligible to become a judge under federal law as he was a member of the territorial legislature. This complaint was technically correct as Sloan's term in the legislature did not officially end until December 31, 1890. The governor's ire was further provoked when Sloan dismissed his appeal of Wolfley v. Gila River Irrigation Company (1890), 3 Arizona 176 by pointing out that the appeal failed to claim any legal errors in the trial record. Other notable decisions by Sloan while he was in Tucson were in Cheyney v. Smith (1890), 3 Arizona 143 when he determined that holidays, Sundays, and other days when the territorial legislature was in temporary recess did not count against a session's 60 day limit and Territory of Arizona v. Delinquent Tax-List of the County of Gila (1890), 3 Arizona 179 which determined a mortgage against a property did not reduce that property's assessed tax value. An 1892 ruling that the territory's government could not be held liable for bonds issued for the benefit of a company was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Lewis v. Pima County (1894), 155 U.S. 54. His preeminent case came when he presided over the trial for the Wham Paymaster Robbery. Sloan remained on the bench till February 19, 1894, with bipartisan support of the judge convincing President Grover Cleveland to allow him to complete his four-year term instead of replacing him at an earlier date. Prescott Judge Richard E. Sloan, c. 1901 After leaving the bench, Sloan also left Tucson, later noting that \\"Had the business outlook been more encouraging I should have remained.\\" He relocated to Prescott, Arizona Territory and returned to private practice. On June 26, 1897, recently inaugurated President William McKinley nominated him for the seat in Arizona's 4th judicial district. Sloan was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 8, 1897. His four-year term was twice renewed by President Theodore Roosevelt, on December 12, 1901 and February 26, 1906. While serving on the bench, Sloan issued legal opinions on a wide variety of issues. In Slosser v. Salt River Canal Company (1901), 7 Arizona 376 and Gould v. Maricopa Canal Company (1904), 8 Arizona 429 he established important precedents in water rights. Holderman v. Arizona (1900), 7 Arizona 120 in turn upheld a murder conviction against two brothers with Sloan's opinion determining that if a judge used a jury during a trial the jury's decision was only advisory. The cases of Steinfeld v. Zeckendorf (1906), 10 Arizona 221, Kinsley v. New Vulture Mining Company (1907), 11 Arizona 66, and Steinfeld v. Zeckendorf (1909), 12 Arizona 245 all involved disputes over mine ownership while United States v. Griswald (1904), 8 Arizona 453 dealt with the postmaster of Nogales losing a registered package containing US$2,000 and McPherson v. Hattich (1906), 10 Arizona 104 involved a contract dispute between a property owner and an architect. A recurring theme in a number of cases was getting attorneys to specify errors when they filed appeals was a recurring problem. In Daggs v. Phoenix National Bank (1898), 5 Arizona 409 the judge wrote: Financial cases were also among Sloan's opinions with Gage v. McCord (1898), 5 Arizona 227 and Bravin v. Mayor of Tombstone (1899), 6 Arizona 212 dealing with the validity of territorial debts. Utter v. Franklin (1901), 7 Arizona 300 confirmed the validity of some railroad bonds issued in 1883. County of Cochise v. Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company (1903), 8 Arizona 221, County of Cochise v. Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company (1904), 8 Arizona 459, Board of Supervisors of Yavapai County v. Territory of Arizona (1906), 9 Arizona 405, and United Globe Mines v. Gila County (1909), 12 Arizona 217 all dealt with property taxes. In addition to his other duties, Sloan was appointed in December 1900 by Governor Oakes Murphy to a commission chartered to revise the territorial legal code. The recommendations of the commission were enacted into law, with only minor changes, by the 21st Arizona Territorial Legislature. As delegate to the 1908 Republican National Convention, Sloan helped raise the issue of Arizona statehood. Governorship Governor Richard E. Sloan Shortly after the inauguration of President William Howard Taft, Sloan was summoned to the White House. Governor Joseph Henry Kibbey, suspecting the reason for the summons, urged the judge to accept the governorship if it was offered to him. Sloan was reluctant to take the position, partially because of the low salary, but was convinced to accept. He took a short time to set his judicial affairs in order and was sworn in as governor in Phoenix on May 1, 1909. At the time of Sloan becoming governor, common opinion was that Arizona would soon achieve statehood. The new governor echoed this view in his inaugural address by expressing his optimism for the quick passage of an enabling act for Arizona. Towards this end, Sloan joined with other territorial leaders to lobby for statehood. In October 1909, Sloan escorted President Taft on a tour of the territory that visited the Grand Canyon, Yuma, Phoenix, and Prescott before going to El Paso, Texas to meet Mexican President Porfirio D√≠az. Territorial Delegate Ralph H. Cameron introduced a statehood bill into the United States House of Representatives in January 1910 and Sloan spent the spring of that year in Washington, D.C. working toward passage of the bill. In June, Sloan was in Frankfort, Kentucky helping to organize a National Governors Association convention. President Taft signed Arizona's enabling act into law on June 20, 1910. Sloan responded by issuing a proclamation calling for the election of 52 delegates to a constitutional convention on June 28, 1910. Another provision of the enabling act was that the 1908 elections would be the final elections authorized under territorial law. This had the effect of canceling the session of the territorial legislature scheduled for January 1911. It was assumed when the enabling act was passed that a state legislature would meet in 1911 to address issues previously handled by the territorial legislature. When final approval of Arizona's statehood was delayed, emergency provisions in the enabling act came into play granting Sloan the authority to authorize needed appropriations and levy taxes. As Sloan later expressed, \\"Congress conferred upon me a greater authority in the matter of taxation than was ever exercised by any other executive in the history of the country.\\" Arizona's constitutional convention ran from October 10 to December 9, 1910. Sloan was unhappy with the document produced by the convention, stating \\"that the Constitution which is being formed will never be adopted\\". Sloan's primary contention was that the state's executive branch should be more centralized, with only the attorney general and state auditor elected separately from the governor. He also advocated a term limit of four or six years for the office of governor. Despite these concerns, Sloan did not advocate delaying statehood, stating \\"Personally, while there are things in the Constitution which I deem unwise still I would, as a citizen be willing to accept them if this would bring statehood ‚Äì hoping that whatever should prove by experience to be unwise would be corrected in the future by amendment.\\" Final approval of the state constitution was delayed in Congress and by President Taft over the issue of recall of judges. After this provision was removed from the document, approval came on August 22, 1911. Following this approval, Sloan called for a December 12, 1911 special election to choose state and congressional office holders. The Territorial Governor's final day in office came on February 14, 1912 when President Taft signed the resolution admitting Arizona to the Union and Sloan attended the swearing-in ceremony for Governor George W. P. Hunt. Federal judicial service On March 1, 1912, President Taft, who also graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School, two years prior to the time of Sloan's graduation,Lurie, Jonathan (2011). William Howard Taft: Progressive Conservative. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. nominated Sloan to be a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. Confirmation of the nomination was delayed by Arizona's two United States Senators who hoped instead for a Democratic nominee. Following the adjournment sine die of the Senate on August 26, 1912, Taft made a recess appointment on August 26, 1912, and Sloan took the bench on September 5, 1912. President Taft renominated Sloan on December 3, 1912, but the Senate never voted on the nomination. The recess appointment expired on March 3, 1913. Later service After leaving the bench, Sloan spent the rest of his life in private legal practice in Phoenix. On August 15, 1921, he became a widower when his wife, Mary, died. At the request of Governor Thomas Edward Campbell, he represented Arizona at the November 1922 conference which created the Colorado River Compact. Sloan was the supervising editor of a four-part History of Arizona in 1930. This was followed by his autobiography, Memories of an Arizona Judge. Death Gravesite of Richard Elihu Sloan . Sloan died in his home in Phoenix on December 14, 1933, the result of a basal skull fracture he had suffered after a fall three days earlier. He was buried in Phoenix's Greenwood Memorial Park (now Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery).

It was among the top 10 best sellers in the U.S. in 1916. The story is presented in a series of letters written by Sallie McBride, Judy Abbott's classmate and best friend in Daddy-Long-Legs. Among the recipients of the letters are Judy; Jervis Pendleton, Judy's husband and the president of the orphanage where Sallie is filling in until a new superintendent can be installed; Gordon Hallock, a wealthy Congressman and Sallie's later fianc√©; and the orphanage's doctor, embittered Scotsman Robin 'Sandy' MacRae (to whom Sallie addresses her letters: \\"Dear Enemy\\"). Webster employs the epistolary structure to good effect; Sallie's choices of what to recount to each of her correspondents reveal a lot about her relationships with them. Plot introduction As Daddy-Long-Legs traced Judy Abbott's growth from a young girl into an adult, Dear Enemy shows how Sallie McBride grows from a frivolous socialite to a mature woman and an able executive. It also follows the development of Sallie's relationships with Gordon Hallock, a wealthy politician, and Dr. Robin MacRae, the orphanage's physician. Both relationships are affected by Sallie's initial reluctance to commit herself to her job, and by her gradual realization of how happy the work makes her and how incomplete she'd feel without it. The daily calamities and triumphs of an orphanage superintendent are wittily described, often accompanied by the author's own stick-figure illustrations. Major themes The novel is set in rural Dutchess County, New York, early in the 20th century. It examines a number of social issues: how to care for orphans (and for children in general), divorce, and the value of women's work. (The latter is a natural extension of the theme of women's education in Daddy-Long-Legs.) While volunteer work by women is widely accepted, women working in responsible positions for pay is still viewed with some hostility by some characters, such as Gordon Hallock, Sallie's friend and later fianc√©, and the Honorable Cyrus Wykoff, a trustee of the John Grier Home. The Hon. Cy (as Sallie calls him) objects to the JGH paying a salary to Betsy, Sallie's assistant: \\"She's a woman, and her family ought to support her.\\" Though the Hon. Cy makes it clear that he thinks Sallie is frivolous and unsuited to superintend an orphanage, Sallie is so devoted to the orphan's well-being that she turns even her social life‚Äîexplicitly criticized by the Hon. Cy‚Äîinto an opportunity to further her cause, recruiting volunteers, benefactors, and foster parents at dinner parties and afternoon teas. Webster also deals with women's life choices in a more subtle fashion. She contrasts the miserable marriage of Sallie's friend Helen with Sallie's fruitful life as she devotes herself to the demanding and strenuous task of running an orphanage. Sallie considers Judy Abbott, who married soon after completing college, an anomaly for her remarkably successful marriage with Jervis. Divorced from her unsuitable husband, Helen ultimately finds happiness in joining Sallie's cause at the orphanage, applying herself to work for the public good. Socialism applied to charitable causes is an underlying theme; the John Grier Home couldn't survive without the beneficence of the trustees and community. The novel also deals with the evolving ideas about how best to care for orphans at the turn of the century, with the institution-style establishments falling out of favor, in light of the modern 'cottage' approach. Care for the children's emotional and spiritual needs is considered paramount, as Sallie works with Dr. MacRae, Judy, and Jervis to enact her reforms. The reasons these are necessary at the John Grier Home is clearly outlined in the first novel, in Judy's miserable recollections of her old home. Concerns with the hereditary origins of 'feeble-mindedness' and alcoholism are expressed by Dr. MacRae and by Sallie. The doctor's anxieties prove to have an underlying basis in his experience, which is revealed towards the end of the novel. Although the themes are intense, the author generally deals with them in an amusing and light-hearted fashion. Other media Dear Enemy was made into a seven-part ITV serial in 1981. with Vanessa Knox-Mower as Sallie McBride and Patrick Malahide as Dr. MacRae.

Retrieved 2010-08-04 Building architecture and history The Lenox Library building occupies a prominent site in downtown Lenox, on the east side of Main Street between Walker and Housatonic Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of brick with stone and wooden trim. Its front facade is dominated by monumental two-story pillars and pilasters, which articulate the three bays. The main entrance is in the center bay, topped by a segmented-arch transom window. The building cornice is studded with modillion blocks, as is the gable supported by the pillars above the entrance. The hip roof is encircled by a lower balustrade, and is crowned by an open belfry and cupola. A substantially larger addition, made in 1889, extends to the rear of the building; it is also topped by a hip roof with cupola. The main block was built in 1815-16 to a design by Isaac Damon of Northampton, and served as the Berkshire County Courthouse until 1869, when that function was moved to Pittsfield. Although the library moved into the building in 1874, it did not fully occupy the premises immediately. Additional tenants during the late 19th century included the offices of lawyers and politicians, and the town's first telephone exchange. The rear addition, known as Sedgwick Hall, was the scene of social events, lectures, and concerts. Notable library collections The Lenox Library houses a number of notable special collections, many of which have a connection to Lenox in some manner. These collections are housed in a variety of locations within Lenox Library. One of these collections is the Tanglewood Papers, which include historical documents on the history of the Berkshire Symphonic Festival and the Berkshire Music Center before Tanglewood, as well as the founding of Tanglewood and the building of its music pavilion, ‚ÄúThe Shed.‚Äù The Tanglewood Papers are from the estate of a well-known summer resident, Gertrude Robinson Smith, whose fundraising efforts resulted in construction of ‚ÄúThe Shed.‚Äù The collection is currently housed in the Keator Vault. The Keator Vault contains local historic items, unique photographs, and functions as temperature controlled preservation archive for rare materials. The Special Collections Vault is sponsored by Mr. & Mrs. Matthew D.M. Keator Family in memory and honor of the Keator and Piretti Families. Very little of the collection has been digitized. A few items were sampled from the collection for the Digital Commonwealth Collection through Boston Public Library. They can be located there by searching for \\"Tanglewood\\". They are also located in the Digital Library of America. The biggest users of the music collection at the Lenox Library are the Boston University Tanglewood Institute students. The second largest users of the collection are concertgoers want to preview a specific music selection before attending the concert. Another notable collection is the Edwin Hale Lincoln Photography Collection. This collection, housed in the Keator Vault, \\"consists of 745 original glass plate and film negatives of the Berkshire estates, as well as a complete set of study prints. In addition, the Library has one of the few remaining sets of Wild Flowers of New England.\\" Edwin Hale Lincoln, a Massachusetts native, joined the photography business in the late 1800s, shooting a variety of subjects, including Rhode Island yachts, estates in Lenox, flowers native to New England, and other flora. The Elizabeth MacKinstry Collection, housed in the Legacy Room, is a collection \\"of illustrated children‚Äôs books of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries [which] include items of British or continental origin.\\" MacKinstry (1879-1956) was a female children's author and illustrator, and this collection includes books penned by MacKinstry herself, as well as books by some of her favourite authors (Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Claud Lovat Fraser).

In 1883, Boulenger decided that at best Letheobia was a subgenus of Typhlops, and placed it as a junior synonym. Later in reconstructing Rhinotyphlops in 1974, Roux-Est√®ve moved all of Letheobia species into Rhinotyphlops, mostly into her Groups IV, V and VI. However, molecular studies in the 2000s showed that Rhinotyphlops, as conceived by Roux-Est√®ve (1974), was polyphyletic, and that many if not all of Groups V and VI constituted a separate genus, for which the name Letheobia had priority. Abstract In 2007 Broadley and Wallach formally revived the genus Letheobia. In 2013, Pyron et al. considered with some certainty that Letheobia was a sister group to the combined genera Afrotyphlops and Megatyphlops, while the three were then sister to Rhinotyphlops, and the four were the sister to Typhlops.

The name and the organization's principles were modeled after the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund. Later, both organizations independently changed their official names to Riverkeeper and Soundkeeper. Soundkeeper and Riverkeeper are founding members of the Waterkeeper Alliance. The term Soundkeeper is a registered trademark of Soundkeeper, Inc. However, it has also become common practice to refer to the lead person who is the water presence of the organization as the \\"Soundkeeper\\". Soundkeeper Inc. was originally located in Norwalk, Connecticut, and was incorporated in 1987 as a not-for-profit environmental organization. Its program area extends from the Battery Park in New York City up the East River, including portions of Queens County and Kings County New York, as well as all of Long Island Sound and its rivers and the watershed in New York and Connecticut. Soundkeeper stated its missionLong Island Sound - Soundkeeper as the protection and enhancement of the biological, physical, and chemical integrity of Long Island Sound and its watershed. To accomplish the organizations stated goals, Soundkeeper Inc. undertook activities in several program areas.Long Island Sound - Soundkeeper In addition to the main program areas which include legal advocacy, monitoring and patrol of Long Island Sound and wetlands restoration, Soundkeeper operated five pump out vesselsLong Island Sound - Soundkeeper in western Long Island Sound to prevent sewage from being discharged overboard from vessel into the Sound. Soundkeeper pioneered new storm water pollution prevention by establishing a pilot program in Norwalk, CT. The \\"Filter Project\\" placed 254 storm drain filter inserts in catch basins designed to kill bacteria, and capture hydrocarbons and other pollutants.Long Island Sound - Soundkeeper After the passing of the original Soundkeeper in 2015, the Soundkeeper Board approached Save the Sound a regional environmental organization working in both CT and NY watersheds of the Long Island Sound. The Soundkeeper organization formerly merged with Save the Sound in 2019 and continued the mission. The organization has a large network of pollution ‚Äúwatchdogs‚Äù a water quality team and lab as well as comprehensive legal and communication support. History After years of repeated public health shellfishing harvest closures caused by malfunctioning municipally owned sewage treatment plants local fishermen in Norwalk, CT, sought a legal remedy to a problem that was causing great economic hardship. Terry Backer and Chris Staplefelt were referred by Bob Gaberilson a Nyack, New York Shad fisherman to then Riverkeeper John Cronin and Riverkeeper Attorney Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to help them become organized. Cronin and Kennedy helped guide the formation of the Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association and obtained legal representation for the group from the New York City law firm of Berel, Kass and Case. Shortly thereafter, Terry Backer, was elected president of the group and led the fishermen's group in filing several sixty-day notice letters of intention to sue several municipalities for violation of the federal Clean Water Act. These cities included; Stratford, Connecticut, Norwalk, Bridgeport and Milford Connecticut.Fairfield JD Directions The Long Island Soundkeeper Fund Inc. was created through a stipulated settlement reached between the Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association and the city of Norwalk, Connecticut, in 1987 to settle a federal Clean Water Act lawsuit. The suit allege thousand of violations of the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit from their sewage treatment plant. The settlement with Norwalk, CT, was divided between several local environmental improvement projects and a payment of $86,500.00 to start a full-time watchdog for Long Island Sound. Using the settlement the Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association founded Soundkeeper, a full-time professional organization dedicated to the protection of Long Island Sound. The first Soundkeeper  Terry Backer assumed the role of \\"Soundkeeper\\" and executive director of the Long Island Soundkeeper Fund Inc. in 1987 and has continued in those positions continuously to the present(2008). The \\"Keeper\\" concept of protecting the local environment would emerge from the work of Cronin and Backer and would soon be emulated in new organizations seeking to become \\"Waterkeepers\\". The \\"Keeper\\" concept was based in aggressive enforcement of environmental laws coupled with a sense of place and responsibility for that place. Cronin and Backer, both fishermen, brought a sharp contrast to other environmentalist and set the tone and tactics of future Waterkeepers. Waterkeeper - a movement  There are currently 188 Waterkeeper organizations on six continents, Soundkeeper, was the second such group preceded by Riverkeeper. The Waterkeeper AllianceWaterkeeper Alliance was founded in 1999.Welcome to the Division of Corporations Since the inception of Soundkeeper, the \\"Waterkeeper\\" concept of protecting local environmental resources has grown rapidly based on the early models of Soundkeeper and Riverkeeper.

A native of York, Pennsylvania, Snyder was listed as tall and . Snyder entered baseball in 1950 as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies' organization; his career interrupted by military service during the Korean War, he never played for the Phillies. But at the end of the 1958 minor-league season, he was traded to the Dodgers along with fellow pitcher Jim Golden and veteran outfielder Rip Repulski for Sparky Anderson, the future Hall-of-Fame manager, who was then a young second baseman in the Dodger farm system. Snyder gained a spot on the 1959 Dodgers' roster and pitched sporadically during the season's first four months.

Pierre Celis Early life Celis was born on 21 March 1925 in his family home on the edge of the Hoegaarden town square. He grew up working on his father's cattle farm, but also helped out in the brewery of his neighbour Louis Tomsin. Tomsin brewed wit beer, which was a speciality in the region around Celis' home town. Becoming a brewer After Tomsin closed his brewery in 1957, wit beer disappeared from Hoegaarden. Celis, who became a milkman after he married, took up beer making in 1965. The first year he started with a wash tub in the barn of his father. With a loan from his father he bought equipment that came from an abandoned brewery in Heusden-Zolder. His first batch of Hoegaarden beer was made on 19 March 1966 and he opened Brouwerij Celis (Celis Brewery). In 1980 he opened Brouwerij de Kluis as he transferred the production to new buildings. In 1985, his brewery partially burned down, and because the buildings were not insured and he had put all the profits back into the brewery, he was forced to sell his company to Interbrew, now AB Inbev. at Wayback machine . He then founded the Celis Brewery in Austin, Texas, managed by his daughter Christine, which he started supposedly with yeast he smuggled in his socks. Because Celis Brewery couldn't follow demand, Miller Br. approached Celis Br. to create a partnership. Celis Br. was sold 100% to Miller in 2000 and closed in 2001.

The membership varied over the years, but the most famous line-up -- comprising John Bieling (first tenor), Billy Murray (second tenor), Steve Porter (baritone), and William F. Hooley (bass) -- recorded for the Victor Talking Machine Company from 1909 to 1913. The same group of singers also recorded for Edison Records as the Premier Quartet (or Quartette), and for that and other labels as the Premier American Quartet. From 1912 to 1914 the quartet also recorded with countertenor Will Oakland as the Heidelberg Quintet. History The name \\"American Quartet\\" was first used on some recordings around 1899 by the group that became more widely known as the Haydn Quartet - that is, John Bieling, Jere Mahoney, S. H. Dudley, and William F. Hooley. That line-up recorded for Edison Records as the Edison Male Quartet, for Berliner as the Haydn Quartet, and for other companies as the American Quartet. After Harry Macdonough replaced Mahoney, the name was used by Edison on some of the group's recordings. Another line-up credited with the same name comprised Albert C. Campbell, W. T. Leahy, Dudley, and Hooley, on recordings for Victor from 1901. Tim Gracyk, American Quartet with Billy Murray, excerpted from Popular American Recording Pioneers: 1895-1925, 2000. Retrieved 31 May 2013 The best known line-up of the quartet was formed in 1909, when Victor Records needed a vehicle for their new singing star, Billy Murray. They formed a group around Murray, with Bieling and Hooley brought in from the Haydn Quartet (in which they continued to sing), and Steve Porter from the Peerless Quartet. Their debut release, \\"Denver Town\\", in the then-popular \\"cowboy song\\" genre, was released in February 1909 and, like many of the group's recordings, was arranged (and in this case co-written) by George L. Botsford. The group also recorded the song for Edison, where it was credited to the Premier Quartette; the record company claimed that Will Oakland sang on the record rather than Macdonough, but according to Jim Walsh this was probably an error. In 1910, the group recorded \\"Casey Jones\\", with Victor Records orchestra leader Walter B. Rogers temporarily replacing Steve Porter. The song was very successful, \\"perhaps the first recording to sell over a million copies in American music history\\". Gage Averill, Four Parts, No Waiting : A Social History of American Barbershop Quartet, Oxford University Press, 2003, p.73 \\"Casey Jones\\" was also recorded by Billy Murray, with a chorus, for Edison Records as one of their \\"Blue Amberol\\" series. The group's recordings became hugely popular, their other early successes including \\"Call Me Up Some Rainy Afternoon\\" (with Ada Jones, 1910), \\"Come, Josephine, In My Flying Machine\\" (also with Jones, 1911), \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\" (1911), \\"Moonlight Bay\\" (1912), and \\"Everybody Two- Step\\" (1912). Bieling left the group in mid-1913 because of the strain on his voice, which worsened when he was required to make \\"cowboy whoops\\" on some records. He was replaced by Robert D. Armour, a young tenor from Mobile, Alabama. Armour then left in mid-1915, and was replaced by John Young, who had previously recorded under the name Harry Anthony. The group continued to make successful recordings, including \\"Rebecca of Sunny-brook Farm\\" (1914), \\"It's A Long, Long Way To Tipperary\\" (1914), \\"Chinatown, My Chinatown\\" (1915), \\"Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, Oh!\\" (1917), and \\"Over There\\" (1917). William Hooley died in October 1918, a victim of the 1918 flu pandemic. The group continued thereafter, with Hooley replaced by bass singer Donald Chalmers who, like Young, had been a member of the Criterion Quartet. After Murray's exclusive contract with Victor expired, the group of Murray, Porter, Young and Chalmers recorded for many companies, including Edison, Columbia, and Okeh, before retiring as a recording entity in 1920. Singer and entrepreneur Henry Burr then proposed that Murray should replace him in the Peerless Quartet, and that the new group - Murray, Albert Campbell, John H. Meyer, and Frank Croxton - should record for Victor, as the American Quartet. This was agreed; the group signed exclusively to Victor, with Murray and Burr receiving $35,000 each per year, and Campbell, Meyer, and Croxton $10,000 each. The new group had some success with songs such as \\"In The Little Red School House\\" (1922), but at a much lower level than previously. Some of the group's later recordings were recorded by Murray with Porter, Young and Chalmers, rather than with the new line-up. The group's final recording, \\"Alabamy Bound\\", was recorded in 1925, just before Victor switched from acoustic to electrical recording; the Quartet did not record with the new technology.

He founded Pennell High School and a missionary hospital in Bannu in the North-West Frontier of British India, now Pakistan. For his work he received the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for public service in India. He published a work on his life under the title Among the wild tribes of the Afghan frontier in 1908. Pennell House at Eastbourne College was named after him.  Early years and 1890s  Born in England in 1867, Theodore Pennell was educated at Eastbourne College and qualified as a doctor (MB, MRCS, LRCP) in 1890, completing his MD and FRCS in 1891. He offered his services to the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1890. His father had died during his childhood, so he developed a very close relationship with his mother. When CMS sent Pennell to India, his mother decided to go too, and they both began learning Urdu. They reached Karachi in 1892 and went to Dera Ismail Khan, where Pennell began medical work. He often traveled round the villages, wearing Pathan dress and living with the people. He made his first visit to Tank in 1893 and established relationships with the Masud and Wazir tribes. In October 1893 he moved to Bannu to present the gospel to travelers to and from Afghanistan. He was fluent in Urdu and Pushtu by then. He combined medical work with public preaching in Pushtu and selling Christian literature, in Bannu and the surrounding villages, accompanied by the first Christian in Bannu, Jahan Khan. The mullahs strongly opposed his work, warning people not to accept his medicine. The mullahs tried to drive people away by telling them that the medicines contained alcohol and pig‚Äôs blood, and would turn them forcibly into Christians. They also said that if the people were fated to die, then it would be better to die as believers. Pennell built a small hospital at Bannu with his mother‚Äôs money. In 1895 he opened a mission boarding school. Several Muslim inquirers showed an interest in baptism, but faced great opposition from relatives and other Muslims. Among his converts were Tayib Khan and Sayyid Badshah. Sayyid Badshah was shot dead soon after making his profession of faith. In 1896, Pennell was invited to visit the bandit Chakki. Pennell shared the gospel with him to such an effect that soon afterwards Chakki left his banditry; he wrote to Pennell: \\"I constantly meditate on your words and I have given up killing and robbery.\\" In 1897 Pennell bought a printing press from Lahore and began publishing a newspaper. There was fighting between the British and the Wazirs but Pennell refused to have an armed guard. \\"Our best defence is our loving relationship with the tribes,\\" he said. \\"Rifles and other weapons cannot protect us.\\" In 1898 Pennell passed his Persian exams and began studying Arabic. He preached regularly in Bannu bazaar, despite opposition. Once an Afghan bit his finger, but in court Pennell pleaded for the Afghan‚Äôs release. Later three Afghans became Christians. Twentieth century Pennell travelling as a pilgrim In 1901 Pennell began learning Punjabi. In 1903 his disciple, Jahan Khan, went as the first Afghan foreign missionary to the Gulf and East Africa (Mombasa). During 1904 Pennell traveled through the Punjab by bicycle, mixing with the local people, with one Afghan companion. He dressed as a sadhu, and was often penniless. He was amazed at the missionaries‚Äô bungalows, more like forts than houses, separating them from the local people, where they sat waiting for inquirers to come to them rather than going out to sit with the people. He was disappointed at the low level of conduct of most Chuhra and Chamar (Untouchable) Christians who had been baptised without inadequate instruction. Pennell was also afraid that concentrating on the Chuhras would deter high caste Hindus and Muslims from coming to Christ. He felt that pressure to produce results in terms of numbers of baptismal candidates was leading to superficial evangelism and slipshod practices, although he acknowledged that many of the Chuhra Christians were worthy spiritual leaders. He was afraid that many so-called Christian workers were \\"rice Christians\\", working for the mission for money alone. In 1908 Pennell became very ill and had to return to England, the first time in 16 years. While there, his mother died. On his return to India he got engaged and married to a Parsee doctor, Alice Sorabji in 1908.\\"Marriages\\" The Lancet (November 14, 1908): 1495. and they had a son.C. L.

Illnesses and death  In 1909 Pennell was again seriously ill in Bannu and on his recovery, he was showered with flowers and congratulations by the local people. On 15 March 1912, a very sick patient was admitted to Bannu hospital with a dangerous infectious illness. Pennell‚Äôs colleague Dr. William Hal Barnett operated on him, and fell sick himself. Pennell operated on Barnett and he too fell sick. Within a few days, Dr. Barnett died and two days later Pennell also died, conscious to the end and unafraid of death.

He is the last living player to play for both the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees and has written a book about his life that is titled The Last Yankee Dodger. He currently lives in Overland Park, Kansas and runs a small construction company and promotes his book through radio interviews and book readings.  Overview  Kipp played semi-pro and professional baseball from 1950 to 1964 and signed on with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1953. That year, he pitched for the Ashville Tourists in the Tri-State League and lead the league with a 2.24 ERA. After military service from 1953‚Äì55, he pitched for the Goodland Tigers and the Mobile Bears. He pitched exhibition games for the Dodgers during spring training in 1956 and spent the season with the Montreal Royals where he won Rookie of the Year with a 20 win season and was an All- Star. He joined the Dodgers on September 1 for the pennant race. He pitched batting practice in the 1956 World Series and joined the Boys of Summer on the 1956 Dodger Goodwill Tour of Japan. Fred Kipp in 1957 with the Brooklyn Dodgers In 1957, Kipp pitched his first game with the Bums against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on September 10. After playing winter ball for the Escogido Leones in the Dominican Republic over the 1957/58 winter, he pitched for the new Los Angeles Dodgers for the whole season of 1958. He pitched in 40 games as a starter and reliever and ended the season with a 6-6 record. He faced 443 batters that year and struck 58 out. In 1959, he pitched for the St. Paul Saints and threw 5 shutouts and made the All-Star team. He pitched two games for the Dodgers during the pennant race at the end of the season. In 1960, he was traded to the New York Yankees and pitched four games before he was sent to the Richmond Virginians. Kipp was the ace reliever for the Virginians and pitched in 150 games over the next three years. He retired from professional baseball in 1962 to raise a family of six.  Early Years  Fred was born in the small, 100-person town of Piqua, Kansas on October 1, 1931. Piqua is famous for being the birthplace of Buster Keaton. Kipp was the third child of Chuck and Ida Kipp and has an older brother Tom and an older sister Donna. He played baseball in the summer and basketball in the winter. He was a standout athlete and became the star of the Iola High basketball team. After World War II ended, the Piqua town baseball team resumed playing and Fred was 14 when he started pitching for the Piqua town against other local farming towns. He struck out men twice his age and got known for his knuckleball. When he was 18, Kipp hitchhiked to a New York Giants tryout in Cassville, Missouri. He was offered a position but decided to go to college instead.  College 1949-1953  The famous basketball coach Tex Winters recruited Fred to Kansas State University with a basketball scholarship. He transferred to Kansas State Teachers College (Emporia) after one semester so that he could play basketball and baseball. He threw a no-hitter his Freshman year at Washburn University and then started playing on the Emporia Rangers town team in the summer of 1950. Besides playing better teams from Ft. Riley, Wichita and Topeka, he played the barnstorming Kansas City Monarchs. In the summers of 1951 and 1952, he played for the Chamberlain Chiefs in South Dakota and the Superior Knights in Nebraska.  1953 ‚Äì Minor Leagues  With an invitation to try out for the Dodgers, Kipp took a 40-hour train ride to Vero Beach, Florida over Easter break from college in 1953. He went to spring training as a free agent and joined the Dodger organization. After graduating from Emporia, he started pitching for the Miami Sunsox in the Florida International League. He pitched poorly in Miami and didn‚Äôt last a month before he was transferred to the Asheville Tourists in North Carolina. Once in the cool mountain air, he got hot. Fred found his groove and lead the league with a 2.24 ERA and earned a 15-5 record. The season went well but he got drafted into the army at the end of the season.  1953-55 ‚Äì The Army  The Korean War was winding down when Fred entered basic training at Camp Rucker in Alabama. Many baseball players were drafted into the military and the Generals would handpick the players for their divisional teams. Fred began pitching for the 136th Bearcats and won 10 straight games. Fred pitched against the St. Louis Cardinal ‚ÄúVinegar Bend‚Äù Mizell ‚Äì whom he would later play in the majors ‚Äì and many other major leaguers.  1955 ‚Äì Kearney, Goodland and Mobile  After getting out of the military to go to graduate school at the University of Northern Colorado at Greeley, Kipp was quickly back pitching for the Kearney Irishmen in the Nebraska International League. When Billy Martin of New York Yankee fame heard that Fred was pitching in the Great Plains, he found Fred and convinced him to play for the Goodland Tigers. Billy was in military duty in Ft. Carson and managed the Goodland team. Fred pitched well and lead the Tigers to some victories before Clay Bryant, the coach of the Mobile Bears, recruited Fred to the Southern Association. Fred ended up playing on three teams that summer and worked his way up to better teams. The Mobile Bears were a AA farm team for the Dodgers and Kipp started playing with 7 weeks left in the season. He ended the season with a 4-2 record and lead the team into the playoffs. He beat the Birmingham Barons twice in the playoffs to win the league playoffs and earn the right to play in the Dixie Series against the winners of the Texas League. The Bears faced the Shreveport Sports in the Dixie Series and beat them in four straight games. After the winning season, Clay Bryant convinced Fred to play winter ball in Caracas, Venezuela. The opportunity to make $1,000/month was a big pay raise, so he went but things didn‚Äôt go well in Venezuela and he soon returned to the States after just one month.  1956 ‚Äì Montreal and Brooklyn  Spring training at Dodgertown went so well for Fred that he soon started pitching exhibition games with the World Champion Brooklyn Dodgers. Competition was obviously much harder in the big leagues and he faced many greats that spring from Ted Williams to Mickey Mantle. Behind Fred were the Boys of Summer ‚Äì Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Gil Hodges, Duke Snider and all the rest. He was throwing to Roy Campanella and relieving the greats like Carl Erskine. Kipp didn‚Äôt make the final cut and went to the AAA Montreal Royals for the season. The Royals and St. Paul Saints were the two top Dodger farm teams and Kipp lead the pitching staff of the Royals that year with a 20-7 record. He pitched 254 innings and got 127 strikeouts and won Rookie of the Year in the International League. Other greats in the league that year were Satchel Paige, Lynn Lovenguth, Billy Shantz, Norm Sherry, and Eddie Lopat. Kipp joined the Dodgers on September 1 when the rosters opened up. The Dodgers were in a three-way pennant race with the Milwaukee Braves and Cincinnati Redlegs. While not getting on the field, Kipp watched the games from the dugout and the bull pen. The Dodgers prevailed in the Pennant race but Kipp was ineligible for the World Series against their nemesis ‚Äì the New York Yankees. Kipp pitched batting practice for the Dodgers and saw Don Larsen‚Äôs perfect game. The Dodgers lost game 7 at Ebbets Field and this would be the last World Series for the Bums who would move to Los Angeles in 1958.  1956 ‚Äì Dodger Goodwill Tour of Japan  The day after losing game 7 of the 1956 World Series, the team started their journey to Japan where they would play 19 games. 51 players, coaches, wives and friends of the Dodgers got on the plane that day and ended up flying 9,254 miles in 29 hours. With stops in LA, Maui, Honolulu, and Wake Island, they arrived in Tokyo with much fanfare. The Dodgers played many All Star Japanese teams and professional teams from Sapporo to Hiroshima. Fred Kipp, Gil Hodges and Pee Wee Reese Tour Hirosmima, Japan. While Kipp hadn‚Äôt even pitched a regular season game for the Dodgers yet, he pitched more than any other pitcher on the Japan tour. Kipp brought a pitch to Japan that they hadn‚Äôt seen before ‚Äì his knuckle ball. The Japanese third baseman Atsushi Hadoka said, ‚ÄúKipp is a hard pitcher to get to. I couldn‚Äôt hit any of his inside balls. They cut the corner sharp. They were puzzlers and I still don‚Äôt know if they were a knuckleball or a palm ball.‚Äù Japanese players called Kipp a ‚Äúknuckleball artist‚Äù. Kipp ended up pitching complete games and struck out 26 batters in 43 innings.  1957 ‚Äì Montreal and a Cup of Coffee  Spring training went well for Kipp in Vero Beach and he again pitched some exhibition games against the Yankees where he faced Mickey Mantle in a rematch of the 1956 World Series. Kipp stayed with the team through the first couple weeks of the season, but was sent back to Montreal on April 27 before he made it to the mound. In Montreal, his sophomore year ended with an 8-17 record with 10 complete games and 99 strikeouts. Throughout the season, there were rumors that he would be called up to the Dodgers, but he didn‚Äôt get called up until the Dodgers could expand their roster in September. Kipp got his cup of coffee on September 10 at Wrigley Field against the Chicago Cubs. He pitched 4 innings in his debut, but gave up 6 hits and 4 runs. He stayed with the Brooklyn Dodgers until the very end and was at the final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957.  1957-1960 ‚Äì Winter Leagues in the Dominican Republic  After the 1957 season, Kipp decided to play winter ball in the Dominican Republic. He played for the Escogido Lions (Leones del Escogido) in the capital that was named Cuidad Trujillo at the time ‚Äì later renamed Santo Domingo. Kipp became their pitching ace and was the first in the league to win 10 games in the 1957-58 season. He helped the Lions win the championship in the 1957‚Äì58 and 1959-60 seasons. Kipp pitched alongside the young Juan Marichal and the Alou brothers. Kipp played with Juan before he pitched in the minor leagues and saw him grow into the dominant pitcher who won more games in the 1960s than any other player. He also saw the Alou brothers grow from teenagers to stars in the Majors. Ozzie Virgil, the first Dominican to reach the majors, was on the team with Kipp as well. These Dominican players were trailblazers that inspired generations of Dominican players who make up over 10% of the major league baseball players in 2016. The Dominican teams were a mixture of expatriates and local talent. The Lions had many American players who were mainly from the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York/San Francisco Giants. From the Dodgers, Kipp‚Äôs teammates were Norm Sherry, Ron Negray, Frank Howard, Stan Williams and Rudy Hernandez. From the Giants organization, he played with Willie McCovey, Willie Kirkland and Bill Wilson.  1958 ‚Äì Full Time Dodger  Kipp became a regular pitcher for the Dodgers in their first year in Los Angeles. Pitching in the Los Angeles Coliseum was a challenge for left handers like Kipp because of the short, left field that was only 251‚Äô down the foul line. Kipp got his first start on Friday April 25 in front of a record setting 60,000 fans who came out to see Stan ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù Musial in his first appearance in Los Angeles. In Kipp‚Äôs first at bat, he nearly hit a home run off the China Wall ‚Äì the 42‚Äô tall screen that was erected to stop home runs in left field. Kipp struck out 5 batters and allowed three runs into the 8th inning. Kipp got his first win despite Musial hitting 4 for 4 that night. Musial was thrown out at home twice and that could have made the difference in the game since the Dodgers won 5-3. Kipp pitched in 40 games that year and pitched 102 innings. He started 9 games and relieved in 31 others and ended up with a 6-6 record while the Dodgers were 71-83 ‚Äì their first losing season since 1944. His wins were a mixture of threes. Three wins at night and three wins during the day. Three wins at home and three wins away. One of the wins came after Kipp only threw a single pitch. Against their arch rival Giants on Labor Day, Kipp pitched all the way to the bottom of the 9th inning with two outs and faced one last batter. On the 140th pitch, Giants catcher Bob Schmidt hit a home run to tie the game and send it into extra innings. Kipp won the Silver Slugger award for being the pitcher with the best batting average of .250 that year.  1959 ‚Äì St. Paul Saints and Dodger Pennant Race  Kipp spent the 1959 season with the St. Paul Saints in the new American Association that consisted of 10 teams. Kipp was the workhorse in the rotation and started 30 games and pitched 213 innings. He struck out 125 batters and won a spot on the All Star team. He went 14-11 and was called up to the Dodgers on September 6 when the Dodgers were in a three-way pennant race with the Giants and Braves. Kipp pitched in two games during the pennant race and helped the Dodgers into a three-game playoff against the Braves. The Dodgers won the playoff and the World Series against the Chicago White Sox.  1960 ‚Äì New York Yankees and Richmond Virginians  During Spring Training, Kipp asked to be traded instead of going down to St. Paul. Kipp was traded to the Yankees for outfielders Gordon Windhorn and Dick Sanders. Kipp traded his Dodger Blue uniform in for pinstripes and joined the Dodger‚Äôs long-time nemesis in the World Series. The Yankees were the powerhouse team that had been to the World Series in 10 of the previous 12 years and won 8 of them. Kipp joined Mickey Mantle, Yogi Bera, Whitey Ford, Ralph Terry and many other stars. Roger Maris joined the team with Kipp that year and was MVP of the league in his first year with the Yankees. Kipp pitched four games for the Yankees before he was sent to the Richmond Virginians farm team. This picture shows the new players for the New York Yankees in 1960. The Virginians were in the International League and Kipp was soon playing against the Montreal Royals and the Havana Sugar Kings. In 1959, Fidel Castro had overthrown the Cuban government and many soldiers went to the game. Kipp reported that teenagers patrolled the streets with AK47s and shot guns at the baseball games when the Sugar Kings made a good play. When a Rochester Red Wing coach got shot with the stray bullet that year, the International League decided to move the Havana Sugar Kings to the US where they became the Jersey City Jerseys. Fred Kipp pitching in Richmond. Kipp became the relieving ace in Richmond and pitched in 47 games in 1960, 50 games in 1961 and 53 games in 1962. He started 17 games in 1961, but was a full-time reliever the other two years. In the winter of 1960/61, he stayed in Kansas City and got engaged to Susan Kokoruda after a few months of dating. They married in the fall of 1961 and honeymooned in Puerto Rico where Kipp played winter ball for the Ponce Leones. Kipp turned 30 and only stayed a month in the Puerto Rican winter leagues before returning to Kansas City. During the 1962 season, his first son Chris was born and the writing was on the wall. Making a living in the minor leagues and raising a family were not compatible. With little chance of getting back to the Major Leagues, Kipp retired from professional baseball at the end of the 1962 season. The Kipps were fruitful and had six children in 9 years. Kipp played semi-pro baseball for Grave Truck Lines in the summer of 1963. In the summer of 1964, he played for Service Auto Glassmen and they won the National Baseball Congress championship in Wichita that year. Kipp started working construction in 1963 and continues to run a construction company in good weather in 2018. Kipp attributes his success in baseball to hard work, natural ability and persistence. He played with the best and against the best in the golden era of baseball. The small-town Kansan played on three continents with the two winningest teams in the 1950s and 1960s. Only 22 Brooklyn Dodgers are still alive and only Fred Kipp played for the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees. Because of this distinction, he is known as the Last Yankee Dodger. He wrote a book about his life and baseball career with his son Scott. The book can be found on Amazon.

Levinson (May 28, 1920 ‚Äì April 12, 1994), a psychologist, was one of the founders of the field of positive adult development. Levinson is most well known for his theory of stage-crisis view, however he also made major contributions to the fields of behavioral, social, and developmental psychology. His interest in the social sciences began with studies on personality and authoritarianism, and eventually progressed to studies on development. Greatly influenced by the work of Erik Erikson, Elliott Jaques, and Bernice Neugarten, his stage-crisis view sought to incorporate all aspects of adult development in order to establish a more holistic approach to understanding the life cycle. In doing so, Levinson discussed the various developmental tasks and/or crises that one must address within each stage as well as how they contribute to the progression of development.Levinson, D. J. (1986) A conception of adult development. American Psychologist, 4, pp. 3-13. doi: 10.1037/0003-066X.41.1.3. Although much controversy surrounds his research methods, Levinson interviewed both men and women to uncover concrete patterns that occur within similar age ranges. Through these studies, he determined that men and women essentially progress through the same cycle of life, however they differentiate in what he refers to as \\"The Dream\\". He published his findings and theory within his two major books, The Seasons of a Man's Life and The Seasons of a Woman's Life; both of which remain as influential publications within the field of psychology. Being both simple in nature and open to further investigation, Daniel Levinson's legacy and lasting contributions are mainly to theory and entail profound implications for social as well as behavioral psychology. Professional life Daniel Levinson was born on May 28, 1920 in New York City, New York. He began his studies of the social sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, whereat he completed his dissertation on ethnocentrism in 1947. Following this, he conducted research on personality, specifically authoritarian personalities at Berkeley and Western Reserve University. In 1950, Levinson shifted his career to Harvard University, and began to examine the interaction between personality and organizational settings. While at Harvard, Levinson worked with colleagues including Erik Erikson, Robert White, Talcott Parsons, Gordon Allport, and Alex Inkeles. Also during his 12 years at Harvard, Levinson published around 36 articles and books in a wide variety of topics, including personality and institutional policy, foreign policy, professional identity, mental health administration, and social change. Levinson further advanced his academic career at Yale University from 1966 to 1990. During this time, Levinson shifted his research attention to adult development. Levinson worked with colleagues including Charlotte Darrow, Edward Klein, Maria Levinson (his wife with whom he had two children), and Braxton McKee while at Yale, and his research focused on interviewing 40 middle-aged men about their lives. Using the information gathered from these interviews, Levinson wrote the book The Seasons of a Man‚Äôs Life. Following this, he conducted a similar study for women, and wrote The Seasons of a Woman‚Äôs Life shortly before his death in New Haven, Connecticut, on April 12, 1994. Judy Levinson, his second wife, collaborated with Daniel Levinson on The Seasons of a Woman‚Äôs Life and she continued his work after his death. Research & Theory Stage-crisis view Levinson created his theory of stage-crisis view by conducting extensive interviews of men and women aged 35 to 45 and looking for common patterns throughout their lives. From his research, Levinson described specific stages of life from childhood to old age, each of which he suggested has a developmental task or crisis that needs to be resolved. Levinson believed that the pre-adulthood stage, early adulthood transition, early adulthood stage, midlife transition, middle adulthood stage, late adulthood transition, and late adulthood stage made up a person's life. Levinson also believed that the midlife crisis was a common and normal part of development. The stage-crisis theory has been criticized due to Levinson's research methods. Levinson studied men and women who were all in the same age group, making his results and conclusions subject to cohort effects. Theory of men and women Levinson believed that the main difference between men and women was ‚ÄúThe Dream,‚Äù which refers to one‚Äôs vision for his or her future life, including goals and desires. Based on findings from his interviews with men and women, Levinson argued that men and women form different types of dreams for their lives: men typically dream about occupation, while women, who have more trouble forming their dreams, are torn between dreams of occupation and dreams of marriage and family.  Personality  Levinson‚Äôs studies on personality began with his first publication in 1950 entitled ‚ÄúThe Authoritarian Personality,‚Äù which established a set of criteria whose purpose was to define personality types by ranking and rating various individual traits using the F-scale personality test.Adorno, T. W., Frenkel-Brunswik, E., Levinson, D. J., & Sanford, R. (1950). The Authoritatian Personality. Oxford, England: Harpers. He continued to research personalities while at Berkeley, however when he arrived at Harvard he instead began to study the interaction between personality and organizations. In his 1959 publication entitled, ‚ÄúRole, personality, and social structure in the organizational setting,‚Äù Levinson sought to investigate the various roles within a social structure, their interaction with one another, and the extent to which they are influenced by and effect ones personality. He suggests that role definition is multifactorial and thereby based on both intrapersonal and environmental contexts. The intra-personal factors that determine one‚Äôs definition and consequences of their role include their conception of the profession as well as their conception of self. Although important in establishing individualization, role definition cannot be complete without a conception of reality and the overall social structure.Levinson, D. J. (1959). Role, personality, and social structure in the organizational setting. The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 58, pp. 170-180. He goes on to state that neither aspect alone is enough to create a role definition; that in order to completely understand the nature of role definition, ‚Äúwe need the double perspective of personality and social structure.‚Äù Levinson continued his studies of personality interactions within social institutions throughout his years at Harvard, and simultaneously published many articles as well. Accomplishments  Major contributions  Levinson's two most prominent publications were his series of books entitled, The Seasons of a Man's Life (with Maria H. Levinson, Charlotte N. Darrow, Edward B. Klein and Braxton McKee) and The Seasons of a Woman's Life. Although controversy surrounds his publications, both books remain promising and highly influential within the field of psychology. His book, The Seasons of Man's Life contains his most well-known theory as well: the stage-crisis view. Throughout this theory, he encompasses a multidisciplinary approach which has allowed him to contribute greatly to the understanding of the entirety of life cycle. The Seasons of a Man's Life was the first to be published, whereby he continued follow-up studies on women and their development throughout the life cycle. Levinson died before completion, however his wife Judy Levinson continued his studies which were ultimately described in his second book of the series, The Seasons of a Woman's Life.

Throughout his lifetime, he conducted various studies by which he made lasting contributions to both the study of development and personality. Although most well known for his stage-crisis theory of development and life structure, his studies on personality and social structure entailed many implications for both behavioral and social psychology as well. While conducting his personality studies at Harvard, he received a National Institute of Mental Health Career Investor grant and 10 years later, upon leaving Harvard, he received a Career Development Award as well. Together these awards gave him an opportunity to continue his research at Yale, which ultimately led to his work on adult development. While his stage-crisis theory remains a controversial one, his book The Seasons of a Man‚Äôs Life endures as an important contribution to the understanding of the human life cycle. Due to his broad range of influence and simple ideas, Levinson‚Äôs legacy lies mainly in his theory.

He converted to Catholicism and was a member of the Dominican Order from 1666. (Depending on the language of publication, his name is spelled a number of different ways including: Wansleben, Vansleben, Vanslebio, Vanslebius, Vanslep, Wanslebio, Wanslebius, J. M. Vansleb, Giovanni Michele, F. Vansleb (F for Father), P. Vansleb or Jean.) Biography Vansleb was born in Erfurt. In 1663, after a long stay in London, Vansleb planned a journey to Ethiopia in search of religious manuscripts for his patron Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha. He never got beyond Egypt, however. It was while staying in Rome, during his return voyage, that he converted to Catholicism. In the service of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Vansleb made another attempt to journey to Ethiopia, and once again went no further than Egypt. Beginning his travels from Marseille on 20 May 1671, Vansleb felt sick on arrival in Cyprus (which he explained as caused by the plague then scouring the island). Despite being very sick for an extended time (and preparing to leave this world, as he explains) he managed to visit Tripoli, Damascus, Aleppo and Seyda during the next 10 months, finally arriving in Bogas, Egypt, in March 1672. Vansleb travelled extensively in Egypt during the next 12 months, making a journey as far down as Sohag, and produced one of the earliest accounts of Upper Egypt: documenting the land, the people (especially the Coptic community), and pharaonic monuments such as the Giza pyramids, the Sphinx and the pyramids of Hawara, as well as Coptic monuments, including the White Monastery. One of his stated missions was to reach Esna, but he never travelled that far up the Nile. Instead he relates a report from two Capuchin missionary brothers, P. Protais and Charles-Fran√ßois d'Orl√©ans, who had visited all the main sites of Upper Egypt in 1668. Contemporary accounts A letter from Dublin, concerning the Porphyry Pillars in Egypt By Dr Huntingdon, published in A collection of curious Travels, London, Vol II, 1738. relate that Vansleb's account was received with mixed feelings. Vansleb is a keen observer, repeatedly trying to get to the bottom of things, yet at other times accepting obscure and spurious explanations without much resistance, for example on the mating rituals of the Nile crocodile.

Airline complaints in the US According to the Airline Quality Rating 2007 report, airline hassles in the United States have increased since 2005.Airline Hassles On Rise - News - MSNBC.com The rate of complaints, on the other hand, have remained roughly the same, with 0.88 complaints per 100,000, half of which were due to problems with flights or baggage. This may be due to passengers being more forgiving since 9/11.USATODAY.com - Today In the Sky: Archives However, there is also criticism about whether the number of official complaints truly reflects the experience passengers are encountering, considering the difficulty passengers have in finding out how to issue a formal complaint.USATODAY.com - Speak up: How to file your airline complaints Furthermore, complaints about airline complaints have increased in the US, showing that those who are able to complain, are dissatisfied with the results. Airline complaints in Europe In Europe, air passengers have more rights than in the US and must be compensated by law for overbookings, cancellations or flight delays.BBC NEWS Business Air passengers win new EU rights After this law (Regulation 261/2004) was introduced in the EU in early 2005, complaints soared, as expected, since more compensation could be expected by passengers who officially complained.Airline complaints soar Money guardian.co.uk In fact, complaints related to cancellations increased 600% and complaints related to delays increased 500%,Complaints to airlines rocket after new EU rules - Home News, UK - Independent.co.uk not surprisingly since those are categories where increased compensation took effect since the new law.

Standards-setting organizations, such as the IEEESee IEEE Standards Association and ANSI, typically require each member of their committees engaged in standard setting to file a letter with the organization stating either that the member does not know of any patents of their company relevant to the standard or else identifying those patents about which they know. When the organization is advised of relevant patents, often it will either seek to use a different technology for the standard or obtain a commitment from the patent owner that it will license users of the standard on reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms.

It was designed to be used in the Savage Model 99 hammerless lever action rifle. The name comes from its original manufacturer, Savage Arms, and the fact that the original load achieved a 3,000 ft/s (910 m/s) velocity with an 87 grain (5.6 g) bullet.\\"The .250-3000 Savage\\" by Chuck Hawks Background Charles Newton designed the 250-3000 Savage case to fit the popular Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle. Newton recommended loading 100 grain (6.5 g) bullets at 2800 ft/s (850 m/s); but Savage Arms reduced bullet weight to obtain a velocity of 3,000 ft/s (910 m/s), making it the first American cartridge capable of that velocity. Achieving that velocity may have been the reason for the choice of the light- for-caliber 87 grain (5.6 g) bullet. Newton questioned if the publicity advantages of velocity compensated for reduced penetration of the lighter bullet in larger game animals.Towsley, Bruce M. American Rifleman (July 2011) pp.54-57 The cartridge has a pressure limit of 45,000 CUP set by SAAMI. It lacks the power of the bigger .25-06 Remington but provides less noise and less recoil. Performance is very close to the .257 Roberts. Arguably it is a better overall cartridge for hunting than the more popular .30-30, but in recent years has lost ground to the .257 Roberts and flatter-shooting 6mm cartridges such as the .243 Winchester. Currently there are very few new firearms being made in .250 Savage. It is an excellent cartridge with moderate recoil for hunting small game on up to deer-sized game. Variants Some varmint hunters use the improved version of this cartridge, known as the .250 Ackley, .250 Improved or .250 Ackley Improved as a dual-purpose intermediate- range cartridge. The .250 Ackley is the same basic cartridge with a steeper shoulder and with the sides blown-out or straightened to increase powder space.\\"The .250-3000 Ackley Improved\\" by Chuck Hawks This provides a velocity improvement of more than 250 ft/s (76.2 m/s) over standard factory loads.

In it, Hamlet offers directions and advice to a group of actors whom he has enlisted to play for the court of Denmark. The speech itself has played two important roles independent of the play. It has been analyzed as a historical document for clues about the nature of early modern acting practices and it has also been used as a contemporary guide to the performance of Shakespearean drama.Rodenberg (2002, 63-65) and Hall (2004, 58-61). While there is some justification for each of these approaches, they should be distinguished from other, far less valid assertions: on the one hand, that Hamlet expresses the opinions of Shakespeare on the art of acting in a straightforward and unproblematic way; on the other, that the speech offers a proto-Stanislavskian view of the art of acting.See, for example, Merlin (2007, 5). The first elides the difference between author and character, while the second ignores the historical specificity of the discourses and meanings attached to theatrical performance.\\"[A]ll theatre is 'mimetic' to some degree--but what Shakespeare understood by the requirement (voiced through Hamlet) that the stage \\"Hold a mirror up to Nature\\" is very different from the aims of 19th-century naturalistic playwrights\\" (Innes 2000, 5). Joseph Roach offers a detailed critique of this ahistorical approach to acting theory in The Player's Passion (1985), especially, with reference to the early modern period, the first chapter.

These guarantees help investors protect foreign direct investments against political and non-commercial risks in developing countries. MIGA is a member of the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C. in the United States. MIGA was established in 1988 as an investment insurance facility to encourage confident investment in developing countries. MIGA is owned and governed by its member states, but has its own executive leadership and staff which carry out its daily operations. Its shareholders are member governments that provide paid-in capital and have the right to vote on its matters. It insures long-term debt and equity investments as well as other assets and contracts with long-term periods. The agency is assessed by the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group each year. History In September 1985, the Board of Governors of the World Bank endorsed the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. MIGA was established and became operational on April 12, 1988 under the leadership of then-Executive Vice President Yoshio Terasawa, becoming the fifth member institution of the World Bank Group. MIGA initially had $1 billion ($1.94 billion in 2012 dollars) in capital and 29 member states. All members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) were eligible to become members of the agency. MIGA was established as an effort to complement existing sources of non-commercial risk insurance for investments in developing countries. By serving as a multilateral guarantor, the agency reduces the likelihood of confrontations among the investor's country and the host country. MIGA's inaugural investment guarantees were issued in 1990 to cover $1.04 billion ($1.83 billion in 2012 dollars) worth of foreign direct investment (FDI) comprising four individual projects. The agency also issued its first reinsurance contracts signed in collaboration with Export Development Canada and the United States' Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). The agency joined the Berne Union, an international community of export credit and investment insurance providers in 1994. In 1997, MIGA issued the inaugural contract under its Cooperative Underwriting Program to support an energy project in Indonesia. In collaboration with the European Union Investment Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the agency set up a fund for investment guarantees amounting to $12 million ($17 million in 2012 dollars). The agency also established the West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund with a capacity of $20 million ($29 million in 2012 dollars). In 1998 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution establishing a general capital increase of $850 million ($1.2 billion in 2012 dollars), and transferring a grant of $150 million ($212 million in 2012 dollars) from the IBRD. MIGA exceeded $1 billion ($1.4 billion in 2012 dollars) in investment guarantees within a single year for the first time in 1999. In 2000, MIGA paid its first insurance claim since the agency's founding. In 2001 MIGA's issuance of new investment guarantees grew to $2 billion. The agency launched its Small Investment Program in 2005 in an effort to promote investment among small and medium enterprises. That same year, MIGA set up its Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility in an effort to promote FDI into Afghanistan. In 2007 MIGA issued investment guarantees for a Djibouti port, marking its first support in the form of Islamic finance. The agency also launched PRI-Center.com (now no longer active) as a portal for information on political risk management and investment insurance, which also contained its FDI information services. In 2009, the Board of Directors enacted changes to MIGA's operating procedures and authorized coverage for default of sovereign financial obligations. The agency also launched an annual publication titled World Investment and Political Risk which reports on trends in worldwide investment and corporate perceptions of prospects and risk, as well as shifts in the political risk insurance industry. Although once dominated by large public and multilateral underwriters, private insurance firms accounted for approximately half of the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance. Governance MIGA is governed by its Council of Governors which represents its member countries. The Council of Governors holds corporate authority, but primarily delegates such powers to MIGA's Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of 25 directors and votes on matters brought before MIGA. Each director's vote is weighted in accordance with the total share capital of the member nations that director represents. MIGA's board is stationed at its Washington, D.C. headquarters where it meets regularly and oversees the agency's activities. The agency's Executive Vice President directs its overall strategy and manages its daily operations. , Hiroshi Matano serves as Executive Vice President of MIGA. Membership Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency member states MIGA is owned by its 181 member governments, consisting of 156 developing and 25 industrialized countries. The members are composed of 180 United Nations member states plus Kosovo. Membership in MIGA is available only to countries who are members of the World Bank, particularly the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. As of 2015, the seven World Bank member states that are not MIGA members are Brunei, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, San Marino, Somalia, Tonga, and Tuvalu. (The UN states that are non-members of the World Bank, and thus MIGA, are Andorra, Cuba, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Nauru, and North Korea.) The Holy See and Palestine are also non-MIGA members. Bhutan is the most recent country to have joined MIGA, having done so in December 2014. Investment guarantees MIGA offers insurance to cover five types of non- commercial risks: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction; government expropriation; war, terrorism, and civil disturbance; breaches of contract; and the non-honoring of financial obligations. MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. The agency may also insure investments such as management contracts, asset securitization, bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements. The agency generally offers insurance coverage lasting up to 15 years with a possible five-year extension depending on a given project's nature and circumstances. When an event occurs that is protected by the insurance, MIGA can exercise the investor's rights against the host country through subrogation to recover expenses associated with covering the claim. However, the agency's convention does not require member governments to treat foreign investments in any special way. As a multilateral institution, MIGA is also in a position to attempt to sort out potential disputes before they ever turn into insurance claims. The agency's Small Investment Program aims to promote FDI into specifically small and medium enterprises. The program offers standard MIGA coverage types except it does not cover breaches of contract. Under the program, small and medium enterprises may take advantage of discounted insurance premiums and no application fees, which are not available to larger investors. To qualify an investment for the Small Investment Program, MIGA defines small and medium enterprise projects as having 300 or fewer employees, total assets not to exceed $15 million and annual revenues not to exceed $15 million. MIGA limits the request amount for the investment guarantee to $10 million, and will guarantee only up to 10 years with a possible 5-year extension.

He is named by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus as a literary figure in his Historiae. There it is told that Rhampsinit was the predecessor of the legendary king Kheops. The first tale of Rhampsinit is about two thieves who rob the king until one of them dies. His brother tries to rescue the corpse and then manages to fool the king to avoid arrest. The second tale is about Rhampsinit's visit to Hades.  Tales  The stories of Rhampsinit are told in book 2 (chapter 121‚Äì124) and today known as Rhampsinit and the masterthief and Rhampsinit's visit to Hades. Herodotus starts the story in chapter 121 with a short introduction of the king: ‚ÄúAfter Proteus, they told me, Rh√¢mpsinit√≥s received in succession the kingdom, who left as a memorial of himself that gateway to the temple of Hephaistos which is turned towards the West.‚Äù Then he tells the two tales of king Rhampsinit:  Rhampsinit and the masterthief  The king was obviously a well-behaved and gifted business-man, he had hoarded a great treasure of gold, silver and jewelry like never seen or heard about before. To hide and control his treasury the king orders his treasure keeper to build him a secure and well- guarded room, in which the king wishes to store his goods. But the treasure keeper secretly leaves one brick stone loose, so that it could be removed at any time. When on his deathbed, the treasure keeper tells his two sons about the loose stone. The brothers decide to sneak into the treasury house frequently and fill their pockets with loots. After some time has passed, Rhampsinit becomes aware that his treasury is decreasing and he gets upset. No one can tell him who stole the goods. Mysteriously, the royal seals are still intact and the doors are well guarded as always. After the third incident the king decides to set traps in the room between the vessels. One night the brothers sneak into the treasury room and one of them gets snared in a hidden loop. Recognizing that he cannot escape anymore, he begs his own brother to decapitate him, so that no one could ever identify him. The brother does as wished and with the head of his kinsman he runs to his mother. Meanwhile, king Rhampsinit throws a tantrum when he discovers the body of the trapped thief without head. He orders the guardians to impale the body and display it in town at the enclosure wall of the palace. Anyone who would stop before the corpse in grief should be arrested at once. The mother of the thief urges her son to find a way to retrieve the body of his brother. Should he refuse, she would immediately go to the king and tell him the truth. The thief has no other choice than obey and so he creates a plan. On a very hot day he charges his two donkeys with full wineskins and guides them along the palace wall, close to the impaled body of his brother. When arriving, he deliberately makes the wineskins rip open. The guardians become curious when the thief laments and scolds his donkeys and the ruckus lures many bystanders who try to calm him down. The thief acts as if he was grateful for the guardian's help and gives them wine from his wineskins. Late that evening, the guards are completely drunk and fall asleep. The thief takes the body and binds it on the donkeys, then he shaves the right cheek of both guards in attempt to humiliate them. Then he flees. Rhampsinit is baffled when he hears about the clever thief. He wants the thief, no matter what the cost. In an attempt to catch him, the king orders his daughter to pretend to be a \\"maid\\" in the royal brothel. The princess is ordered to sweet-talk every lover in telling her his most sinister deed. Whoever would tell her the story of the manipulated treasure room, should be arrested by the royal guards. The masterthief visits the princess, too, but smelling a rat he tricks her: He brings the right arm of his deceased brother and then tells her about his deed. When the princess tries to hold him by the arm, he releases the dead arm and flees. King Rhampsinit is so impressed by the cleverness and ability of the masterthief that he sends out a harbinger to invite him to make peace. He promises his daughter for marriage to the one who could prove he was the masterthief. The hero accepts the invitation and Rhampsinit keeps his word. The masterthief and the princess marry and the story ends happily.  Rhampsinit¬¥s visit to Hades  After leaving the royal throne to the masterthief, Rhampsinit travels alive to the underworld, which is called ‚ÄúHades‚Äù by the Hellenes. There he plays dice with the goddess Demeter. After defeating her, the king is allowed to return to the realm of the living, and Demeter gives him a golden towel as his prize.Joseph Russo, and Bennett Simon. \\"Gambling with Demeter: Winning, Losing, and Successful Outcome in Herodotus' Histories.\\" Arion: A Journal of Humanities and the Classics 25, no. 1 (2017): 131-60. Accessed October 13, 2020. doi:10.2307/arion.25.1.0131. As soon as Rhampsinit returns home, all priests of Egypt celebrate a feast; Herodotus says that this feast was still celebrated in his lifetime. Herodotus closes his stories in chapter 124, where Rhampsinit is followed by a king Kheops, whom the author describes as \\"cruel\\" and \\"evil.\\"  Further sources about Rhampsinit  Rhampsinit is also mentioned by the late Roman Egyptian historian John of Niki√ª, who evidently took his information from Herodotus. However, John of Niki√ª confused Rhampsinit partly with king Khufu and additionally reports that Rhampsinit built three temples (the pyramids) and that he closed all temples of the country.  Modern evaluations  The story of Rhampsinit is today evaluated as some sort of satire, in which a king is fooled by a humble citizen. The tale shows great similarities to other demotic fairy tales, in which Egyptian kings are depicted as being dimwits and their deeds are negligent or cruel. It is also typical for those fables to depict mere servants or citizens as superior to the king. Herodotus¬¥ stories fit perfectly into that schema. In all of his anecdotes he somehow manages to draw a negative or, at least, sinister character picture of any Egyptian ruler.Alexandra von Lieven: Fiktionales und historisches √Ñgypten (Das √Ñgyptenbild der Odysee aus √§gyptologischer Sicht). In: Andreas Luther: Geschichte und Fiktion in der homerischen Odyssee (interdisziplin√§re Tagung, Oktober 2003 an der Freien Universit√§t in Berlin). Beck, Munich 2006, , page 61‚Äì76. Morris Silver points to similarities of Herodotus¬¥ story to that of Troph√≥nios and Agamedes and the treasury of Hyreus, written by Pausanias in 200 A.D.. The story of Rhampsinit playing dice with Demeter in Hades is seen as an allusion to the old tradition to throw dice in attempt to clear up economical and/or political decisions, such as division of conquered lands or allocations of estates.Morris Silver: Taking Ancient Mythology Economically.

It was originally formed when Merck acquired the Millipore Corporation in 2010. Merck is a supplier to the life science industry. The Millipore Corporation was founded in 1954, and listed among the S&P; 500 since the early 1990s, as an international biosciences company, known widely for its micrometer pore-size filters and tests. In 2015, Merck acquired Sigma-Aldrich and merged it with Merck Millipore. In the United States and Canada, the life science business is now known as MilliporeSigma. History Formation and naming In the early 1950s, Lovell Corporation won a contract from the U.S. Army Chemical Engineers to develop and manufacture membrane filtering devices and systems used to separate the molecular components of fluid samples. When the membranes were declassified in 1953 and offered for commercial use, Jack Bush, a Lovell employee, bought the company‚Äôs right to the technology for $200,000 and established the Millipore Filter Company. Bush coined the word millipore to use in the company's name to refer to large number of small openings in the microporous membrane that the company produced. At this point, however, \\"millipore\\" has become an actual word in general use apart from this company's use of it, referring to any of several filters, made from cellulose acetate membranes, capable of removing very small particles. Later the company changed its name to Millipore Corporation to reflect its growing range of products. In 2010, Merck KGaA the world's oldest chemical and pharmaceutical company- acquired Millipore Corporation to form EMD Millipore. Filters By 1959, Millipore made porous membrane filters of cellulose esters or other materials which resembled paper in sheet form, and were brittle when dry but friable when wet.Bassett (1959). \\"Peripheral Nerve and Spinal Cord Regeneration: Factors Leading to Success of a Tubulation Technique Employing Millipore\\". Experimental Neurology 1: 386‚Äì406 Filters consisted of nitrocellulose or polycarbonate membrane nucleopore filters ranging from pore size of 0.2 Œºm (micrometer) to 20 ¬µm. Modern filter are Polyvinylidene fluoride and/or Polypropylene based. Growth By 1970, Millipore had established subsidiaries in seven countries. The company opened manufacturing plants in Jaffrey, New Hampshire; Molsheim, France; Cork, Ireland; and several other locations. Millipore‚Äôs 2006 acquisition of Serologicals Corporation improved the company's position in high-growth markets such as drug discovery products and services, antibodies, cell biology reagents, and stem cell research. As of the late 2000s, Millipore was the only company providing both upstream cell culture and downstream separations offerings for biopharmaceutical production.

They have released six full-length albums to date: Supreme Art of War (1999), At the Gates of Utopia (2001), The Gorgon Cult (2004), Mare Nostrum (2008), Hesperia (2013), and Far (2019). Their prominent use of keyboards compared to many other black metal bands gives their sound an epic feel, much like power metal. Most of their songs have an epic theme, recurring to stories and characters from Greek Mythology (Zeus, Hades, Persephone, Prometheus, Medusa, Titans), and battles. Their vocalist, Cristiano can scream in two voices: the first one high pitched, which is relative to black metal and the second is more guttural and monstrous, which is relative to death metal and often used for choruses. The band gained attention in late 2004 after the release of the \\"Under the Boards\\" music video, which featured large amounts of blood and gore. The clip was banned from most TV channels but gained popularity due to internet downloads.

The first building Widnes in the 1870s was a rapidly growing chemical town, with all the problems associated with such growth. Living conditions were poor, houses were overcrowded, brawling was common, drunkenness was rife, and murders were not unknown. On 13 May 1878 it was decided to build a 320-seat church in Halton View on a site presented by Mr. John Bibby, land-owner. The Page Lane Mission was built first and opened on 16 February 1879. The present building It was soon evident that a larger church would be required and accommodation was sought for 520 people. St Ambrose Church was designed by James Francis Doyle, whose principal area of activity was in Liverpool and the Wirral. At least part of the cost was funded by the Incorporated Church Building Society. The foundation stone was set by the Home Secretary, the Rt. Hon. R. Assheton Cross M.P., during a service conducted by the Vicar of Farnworth on 8 October 1879. St Ambrose was opened on Monday 28 March 1881, with the chancel unfinished. The consecration took place on 6 December 1883, when the building was finally paid for. The total cost was ¬£5150, which did not include the cost of the many gifts to the church. Features The floor plan of the church is in the traditional gothic style, oriented east-to-west, with a nave and two side aisles, a chancel and an apse-shaped east end. The nave has five arches supported on pillars, with clerestory windows above the arches. The chancel roof is the same height as the nave. The vestry and organ are off the chancel on the south side. A copy of the original ground-plan as Doyle designed it can be found on the Church Plans Online site.http://www.churchplansonline.org (click on \\"Advanced Search\\"; enter ICBS number 08404 in the relevant box and click \\"Start Search\\"). There are three stained glass windows including one by Caroline Townshend at the west end of the nave depicting Mary greeting the risen Christ, the woman who anointed Jesus' feet with ointment and the widow casting her mite into the temple treasury. The centre light of the east window depicts Jesus as the Good Shepherd, with war memorial windows either side showing St Ambrose and St George. The window in the fourth arch of the south aisle arcade was given by German former prisoners of war in 1947 in recognition of the hospitality of this church to them before their release to return home. It depicts St Boniface the (English-born) patron saint of Germany. The octagonal vestry shown in outline on the plans was eventually built, but the tower shown in the drawing above was not, and the only evidence in the building itself that there was to have been a tower is the \\"blind\\" arch on the north side of the chancel, and the \\"blind\\" door at the east end of the north aisle. At a later (unknown) date, a lean-to was added to the octagonal vestry to house a toilet and storage for tools for churchyard maintenance. The outside door to the tools store has since been sealed up, presumably due to vandalism. Later works In more recent years alterations have been made to both the interior and the exterior to bring it further into line with contemporary uses and legal requirements. In the 1980s pews were removed and carpet laid at the back of the building to create a space for circulating around the font. In 2001 a disabled access ramp in brick and york stone was added to a design by Robin Wolley, architect, of Ruthin. In 2008 the rear arch on each side of the nave was enclosed to create a kitchen on the south side and toilets (including one accessible for disabled people) on the north side, to a design by Snape Cowing Architects of Ormskirk. In 2011 the entire heating system was replaced. The Victorian 4\\" bore cast iron pipes and 1960s gas boilers had reached the end of their useful life and the building is now heated with a state-of-the-art pair of boilers, new pipework and radiators.

She was the first MacBrayne vessel to be built outside Scotland and the first to be launched sideways. With bow, stern and side ramps, Hebridean Isles is suitable for all the routes served by the large fleet units. After 15 years crossing the Little Minch on the Uig triangle, she now serves Islay. History MV Hebridean Isles (\\"Heb Isles\\" a nickname used amongst crew and passengers alike) was constructed at Cochrane‚Äôs yard in Selby and launched sideways into the Ouse in 1985. She was the first MacBrayne vessel to be built outside Scotland, the first to be launched sideways and the first to be launched by royalty ‚Äì the Duchess of Kent. Broadly similar to the she was designed to be suitable for use anywhere within the network, although intended for the Uig triangle. Following her delivery voyage, she conducted trials at various ports around the network and did not take up duties at Uig, Skye until spring 1986. MV Columba, the winter relief ship continued there while construction works were carried out at the various piers. New linkspans were required at all three terminals. The new ferry found temporary employment as a winter relief vessel at Ullapool and Oban, where she stood in for the and . Even when she took over at Uig, she still had to use her hoist at the Skye terminal for eight months while the new berth at the end of the long pier was finished. She brought vastly improved standards of passenger comfort and became popular, with slightly reduced sailing times and, once she was able to use her bow and stern ramps, greatly reduced turn-round times. Layout MV Hebridean Isles design incorporates a bow visor, bow and stern ramps, and a vehicle hoist with side ramps. This made her suitable for all the routes served by the large fleet units. Her spacious car deck can accommodate almost 70 cars, with passenger accommodation on two decks forward of the hoist. One deck comprises the cafeteria furthest aft, then the entrance concourse, shop and information point, with the reclining lounge and bar towards the bow. The bar was converted to a Coffee Cabin in December 2008. Above the cafeteria is the observation lounge with crew accommodation forward of this. The bridge is on the next level at the bow. Externally there is ample deck space including, like the Isle of Arran, a deck area forward of the bridge, giving passengers a view ahead. Service MV Hebridean Isles spent her first 15 years almost exclusively on her intended crossing of the Little Minch. She sailed from Uig on Skye to Tarbert and Lochmaddy, using her stern ramp at Uig and her bow visor and ramp at both Tarbert and Lochmaddy. There were no Sunday sailings to Harris. After 15 years demand became too much and in 2001 she was replaced by the new . Hebridean Isles headed south as the dedicated Islay ferry, taking over from . Operating out of Kennacraig on the Kintyre peninsula, she sailed to Port Ellen and Port Askaig. On summer Wednesdays she continued to Colonsay and Oban, returning to Kennacraig in the evening. Between 2003 and 2011, she was joined by Isle of Arran in the summer, to provide a series of additional sailings throughout the week and to maintain the service on Wednesdays during the Oban extension. For six months from October 2002, she was chartered to Northlink Ferries and inaugurated their Stromness to Scrabster service. She continues to relieve there each winter. During June and July 2010, Hebridean Isles was redeployed on the Oban to Coll and Tiree run, replacing , which had suffered major engine problems. She hit the pier at Scarinish, Tiree, on the late afternoon of 29 June 2010, sustaining a hole above the waterline. Reverse pitch was selected prior to the collision but an unspecified problem prevented reverse engaging. The vessel returned to Oban for repair and resumed the Coll and Tiree run two days after the incident. In summer 2011, joined Hebridean Isles as the main Islay vessel, meanwhile Isle of Arran became a spare vessel. On 28 January 2014, it was announced that Hebridean Isles would temporarily take over freight services between Ullapool and Stornoway in the Western Isles, due to the freight ferry colliding with the pier at Stornoway. Hebridean Isles relieved on the Uig Triangle, alongside , in January and February 2016 whilst was away covering for other vessels. In July 2016, she collided with the pier at Kennacraig, with her traffic being carried by the and the cargo boat MV Red Princess. In October 2016, Hebridean Isles provided a twice-nightly freight service on the Ullapool - Stornoway route whilst was in dry-dock. From 3 January to 21 January 2017, Hebridean Isles relieved on the Ardrossan-Brodick ferry crossing alongside in place of , which was away for her annual overhaul. She repeated this service in January 2018, 2019 and 2020. During April and May 2018, Hebridean Isles operated an Oban-Lochboisdale service, whilst was away from the Mallaig-Lochboisdale route, covering for s repair at James Watt Dock in Greenock. In September 2018, Hebridean Isles relieved on the Ardrossan-Brodick crossing in place of . During this time, Isle of Arran was out of service owing to issues with her propeller shaft, and had sustained damage to her loading ramps whilst carrying an overweight vehicle. Hebridean Isles provided additional cover on the Ardrossan-Brodick ferry crossing, in addition to her first ever sailing to Campbeltown , with Caledonian Isles operating with a reduced capacity. Additionally, provided additional sailings on the Claonaig to Lochranza crossing to help ease congestion. After relieving at Arran in January 2019, Hebridean Isles returned to Arran in March 2019 to cover for the , which had rammed the pier at Brodick and sustained damage to her bow visor as a result of her bow thrusters failing.

Throughout most of the Edo period, Nihonmatsu Castle was home to the Niwa clan, daimy≈ç of Nihonmatsu Domain. The castle was also known as or . The castle is one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan, and in 2007 was designated a National Historic Site. The castle grounds are also a noted venue for viewing sakura in spring. Situation Nihonmatsu Castle is located on a spur of the Adatara mountains, approximately halfway between the cities of Fukushima and K≈çriyama, along the Abukuma River. The ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç highway connecting Edo with northern Japan passes through this location, which is in narrow valley beside the river in front of the castle, and thus this location was of critical strategic importance. The main enclosure of the castle was originally located on top of the hill, with secondary enclosures around the base; however, following the destruction of the main enclosure during battles of the late Sengoku period, the castle was rebuilt at the base of the hill.  History  Muromachi and Sengoku periods A fortification was erected on the site of Nihonmatsu Castle during the Muromachi period. In 1341, Hatakeyama Takakuni, who was appointed ≈åsh≈´ tandai by Ashikaga shogunate, established a fortified residence at this location, and changed his name to \\"Nihonmatsu\\". However, despite his title, he was relatively powerless against the local Date clan and Ashina clan, whose territories surrounded his domain. Nihonmatsu Mitsuyasu rebuilt Nihonmatsu Castle in the early 15th century. In 1568, Nihonmatsu Yoshitsugu was attacked by Date Terumune, the father of the famous Date Masamune. Outnumbered and defeated, he pretended to surrender, but instead took Terumune hostage. Masamune‚Äôs forces counterattacked, and in the ensuring battle both Nihonmatsu Yoshitsugu and Date Terumune were killed. The Date clan then fought the Battle of Hitotoribashi in 1585 against a group of adventurers from the Satake, Ashina, Iwaki and Ishikawa clans from Hitachi province, who had sought to take advantage of the weakness of Nihonmatsu to seize the territory for themselves. The following year, Date Masamune once again attacked Nihonmatsu. The son of Hatakeyama Yoshitsugu set the castle on fire and fled to Aizu. The castle was then rebuilt by Data Masamune as a key fortification of his border against the Ashina clan, and assigned his general Katakura Kagetsuna as castellan. He was later replaced by Masamune‚Äôs cousin, Date Shigezane. After the defeat of the Ashina, the Date clan became the most powerful clan in the T≈çhoku region of Japan. However, with the rise of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the clan was forced to submit and the Nihonmatsu area was surrendered in 1589 to Hideyoshi‚Äôs favorite, Gam≈ç Ujisato, who ruled the 900,000 koku Aizu Domain. After Gam≈ç Ujisato died, his territories were assigned to Uesugi Kagekatsu, who also ruled from Aizu. However, the Uesugi sided with the pro-Toyotomi faction in the Battle of Sekigahara and their territories were substantially reduced by Tokugawa Ieyasu after the formation of the Tokugawa shogunate. Edo period Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the castle was briefly assigned to the Matsushita clan, a branch of the Gam≈ç clan until 1627. The territory was then assigned to Kato Yoshiakira, one of the heroes of the Battle of Shizugatake and builder of Matsuyama Castle in Iyo Province. In 1643, the Niwa clan was transferred to become daimy≈ç of Nihonmatsu Domain. The Niwa abandoned the old fortifications at the top of the hill, and completely rebuilt the castle at its base, from which they ruled until the Meiji restoration. During the Boshin War, Nihonmatsu Domain joined the pro-Tokugawa ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei, and was the site of the Battle of Nihonmatsu as part of the overall Aizu campaign. During the struggle, the castle fell after a single day to the superior firepower of the modernized Satch≈ç Alliance forces of the new Meiji government, during which 337 samurai from Nihonmatsu and 206 samurai from allied domains were killed and much of the castle was destroyed. Modern era Stone base of the main tenshu As with many Japanese castles, in 1872, subsequent to the Meiji restoration the remaining castle structures were destroyed and the site was transformed into a park. The site, called became famous for its sakura blossoms in spring, and a festival featuring dolls made from chrysanthemum flowers in autumn. In 1982, the Minowa gate and an attached yagura turret were reconstructed, and stone walls were repaired. The foundation stone base of the main tenshu was restored in 1993.

History Oil-sands extraction in Utah started in the 1960s when two extraction plants were constructed. Western Industries opened a strip-mine and built a pilot plant along the east side of the Whiterocks River and Major Oil Company opened a strip-mine and built a pilot plant on the west side off the Whiterocks River. In 2005, Nevtah Capital Management and Cassandra Energy (now: Black Sands Energy) formed a joint venture to develop Utah's oil sands and opened a pilot plant at the Asphalt Ridge lease location. The pilot plant became in operation in November 2005. Technology The joint venture uses closed-loop solvent extraction process originally proven by X-TRAC Energy in Wyoming in 1998, with a full-scale production plant. Black Sands Energy has exclusive rights to a technology. The above-ground extraction process dissolute crushed, 1\\" minus oil sands materials through contact with a benign non-toxic solvent in an enclosed extractor vessel at temperatures up to at near-atmospheric pressures. As the material dissolves, it is passed to a wash chamber where any remaining oil is removed. The oil-free sand is then desolventized with heat, which converts the liquid solvent to a gas, leaving dry solids suitable for mine backfill. The solvent-oil mixture is pumped into a critical unit for the removal of asphalt and oil from the solvent through heating and cooling. The recovered solvent is compressed back to a liquid, cooled and re-circulated to the extractor vessel in an endless loop. The system consists of only few moving parts and it operates on a gravity principle. Since the process does not use water to recover the oil, energy requirements are minimal. Operations The partnership holds the rights to 13 oil sands leases in Utah consisting of containing over 650,000,000 bbl of recoverable oil. The joint venture owns a 200 bbl per day mobile pilot plant and preparing a 2,000 bbl per day commercial production unit. The production capacity is expected to increase up 50,000 bbl per day by the end of 2009. The system has been improved to maintain processing levels at cold temperatures. A steam jacket has been installed which creates drier sand and keeps the pumps, plumbing and the extraction chamber warmer during standby time, minimizing warm-up time. System performance has improved with the installation of more powerful pumps and additional sensors for better indications of mass flow, temperature and material levels. The upgraded process control provides more precise data required in order to measure the system's performance. Partnership The partnership is between Nevtah Capital Management, Inc., and Black Sands Energy Corp. The extraction technology is provided by development by Black Sands Energy and the financing is provided by Nevtah Capital Management. On 12 January 2007, Nevtah Capital Management and Black Sands Energy announced a joint venture agreement with Korea Technology Industry. According to the agreement, Korea Technology Industry provides $19 million for the development of the Whiterocks Deposit, in exchange of 50% of net profit. The joint venture agreement is limited to 100 million barrels of oil.

Miller (June 10, 1831 ‚Äì September 4, 1920)Beekeeping For Beginners: CATCH THE BUZZ CC Miller's Home for sale was an American practical commercial beekeeper who specialized in comb honey production. He was originally a physician, but gave up that profession to keep bees and to write about beekeeping. His books include A Thousand Answers to Beekeeping Questions and Fifty Years Among the Bees. For many years he was also a popular advice columnist for the American Bee Journal and composer of various \\"bee\\" songs. Early life Charles C. Miller (generally referred to as C. C.) was born in Ligonier, Pennsylvania on 10 June 1831.History of McHenry County, Illinois 1922. Chicago: Munsell Publishing Company. Miller‚Äôs father, Johnson J. Miller, died when he was ten years old, leaving a family of six and little money. As a young man, Miller worked his way through grammar school (taking three years off to help support the family) and eventually moved from his native Pennsylvania to Schenectady, New York, where he worked his way through college. Miller writes: With such sacrifice, hard work, and dedication to become a physician, one assumes Miller would have easily made a career of medicine. Unfortunately, his disposition did not allow him to follow through with a practice.Bad Beekeeping, Ron Miksha, p 157, 2004. ‚ÄúIt did not take more than a year for me to find out that I had not a sufficient stock of health myself to take care of that of others, especially as I was morbidly anxious lest some lack of judgment on my part should prove a serious matter with some one under my care. So with much regret I gave up my chosen profession.‚Äù Soon Miller was married, was teaching voice and instrumental music, and had become principal of a public school. He needed something extra to stimulate his vast intellect, to allow a bit of challenge, and to improve his health with ‚Äúrobust work and fresh air.‚Äù A swarm stumbled onto his porch. He became a beekeeper. As a physician, Miller suffered greatly from stress. He wrote that he worried constantly that he would misdiagnose a patient and prescribe an incorrect medicine. Beekeeping Beginning as an amateur beekeeper as the result of a swarm that his wife hived into a sugar barrel when it landed on their porch in 1861, Miller expanded his business steadily. By 1878, Miller made his living from keeping bees. He eventually settled in Illinois. Miller expanded his honey farm to over 300 colonies of bees, and became North America's largest producer of comb honey. Writings Writing part memoir, part bee culture, Miller began his personal account of the honey business in 1886 with A Year Among the Bees, in which he announced he had \\"made the production of honey his exclusive business\\" for eight years. This was expanded into Forty Years Among the Bees (1903, 2nd ed. 1906), then into his classic, Fifty Years Among the Bees (1911), culminating with A Thousand Answers to Beekeeping Questions (1917). Miller also edited the American Bee Journal and produced a popular monthly advice column answering reader's questions.American Bee Journal, published by Dadant & Sons. In honor of his fifty years of writing about apiculture and his gift of his personal beekeeping library, the University of Wisconsin named its apicultural library the Dr. Charles C. Miller Memorial Apicultural Library.  Music  The Bee March Miller was a musician, a composer of both church and lay tunes. We have from him several beekeepers' songs, the stanzas of which were written by poet- beekeeper, Eugene Secor, of Iowa: \\"The Hum of the Bees in the Apple Tree Tops,\\" \\"The Beekeepers‚Äô Reunion Song,\\" \\"Dot Happy Beeman,\\" \\"Beekeepers' Convention Song,\\" and \\"Spring Time Joys.\\" These were compiled and printed by George W. York as pamphlet Songs of Beedom. He also composed \\"The Bee March\\" which was included in music selections for the organ.

Military exercises of the toy army In 1682, when Peter with his mother, Natalia Naryshkina, relocated to the royal lodge in Preobrazhenskoye, he gradually formed a miniature army, ostensibly to school himself in the modern art of war. Besides fellow children, the servants and retainers were being enlisted, with 25-year-old Sergei Bukhvostov recorded in 1683 as the 'first Russian soldier'. Initially, the \\"play soldiers\\" were organized as a 100 men strong Company of Bombardiers. The boys played war, and as they grew, their games became more complex and realistic. Professional military advice was sought, and foreign officers were hired as instructors, eventually becoming part of the permanent officer corps of the Poteshnyi. By 1685 the Poteshnyi numbered 300 and were quartered in specially built barracks near Preobrazhenskoye and as their numbers increased, a second similarly sized group was barracked in neighboring village, Semenovskoe. With further drafts of Streltsy volunteers, the Poteshnyi were organized into the Preobrazhensky and the Semenovsky companies in 1687. At this stage both companies included artillery and cavalry components. During the 1689 coup attempt by regent Sophia Alekseyevna, the Poteshnyi had been part of the units supporting young Peter, along with most of the Streltsy, and leading members of Russian nobility. The companies were being expanded and on 25 April 1695 officially became Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky Regiments of the Guard. These regiments became the beginnings of the Russian Imperial Guard. As Peter matured, the regiments did as well, and Peter participated fully in the army, joining its ranks as a bombardier, and rising up to colonel and head of the regiments.

Overwhelming majority of Muslims in Bangladesh are Bengali Muslims at 88%, but a small segment about 2% of them are Bihari Muslims. Most Muslims in Bangladesh are Sunnis, but there is a small Shia community. Most of those who are Shia reside in urban areas. Although these Shias are few in number, Shia observance commemorating the martyrdom of Muhammad's grandson, Husain ibn Ali, is widely observed by the nation's Sunnis. Muslims celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, Muharram, Milad un Nabi, Shab-e-Barat and Chand Raat all across the country with much fanfare and grandeur. The annual Bishwa Ijtema is the largest and most notable congregation of Muslims in Bangladesh. The Muslim community in the Bengal region i.e (West Bengal, Bangladesh) developed independent of the dominant Islamic trends in India. Features of Bangladeshi Hinduism, which differed in some respects from Hinduism in other parts of South Asia, influenced both the practices and the social structure of the Bangladeshi Muslim community. In spite of the general personal commitment to Islam by the Muslims of Bangladesh, observance of Islamic rituals and tenets varies according to social position, locale, and personal considerations. In rural regions, some beliefs and practices tend to incorporate elements that differ from and often conflict with orthodox Islam. According to Aziz Ahmad , Arabic Islamic scholars have considered the form of Islam followed in Bengal i.e (Bangladesh, West Bengal) have some elements of Crypto-Hinduism in it. Hinduism Durga Puja celebrations in Dhakeshwari Temple, Dhaka Shiva Temple in Puthia, Rajshahi Hinduism is the second largest religious affiliation in Bangladesh, with around 12,492,427 people identifying themselves as Hindus and making up about 8.5% of the total population according to the 2011 census, down from 9.2 per cent as of the 2001 census. According to a random sampling from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) which is less accurate and less reliable than the decadent \\"Population and Housing Census\\" conducted by the same agency every ten years because of the small sample size, there were 17 million Hindus in Bangladesh as of 2015, out of a total 158.9 million population. In terms of population, Bangladesh is the third largest Hindu populated country of the world, just after India and Nepal. Bangladeshi Hindus are predominantly Bengali Hindus, but a distinct Hindu population also exists among the indigenous tribes like Garo, Khasi, Jaintia, Santhal, Bishnupriya Manipuri, Tripuri, Munda, Oraon, Dhanuk etc. Hindus are evenly distributed throughout all regions of Bangladesh, with significant concentrations in northern, southwestern and northeastern parts of the country. In nature, Bangladeshi Hinduism closely resembles the rituals and customs of Hinduism practised in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal, with which Bangladesh (at one time known as East Bengal) was united until the partition of India in 1947. Hindu festivals of Durga Puja, Rath Yatra and Janmashtami witness jubilant celebrations across various cities, towns and villages of Bangladesh. Buddhism Buddha Dhatu Zadi, a Buddhist temple in Bandarban Somapura Mahavihara is a World Heritage Site at Naogaon About 1,000,000 people in Bangladesh adhere to the Theravada school of Buddhism. Buddhists form about 0.6% of the population of Bangladesh. In antiquity, the region of present-day Bangladesh was a center of Buddhism in Asia. Buddhist civilisation, including philosophies and architecture, traveled to Tibet, Southeast Asia and Indonesia from Bengal. The Buddhist architecture of Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand, including the Angkor Wat Temple and the Borobudur vihara, are believed to have been inspired by the ancient monasteries of Bangladesh such as the Somapura Mahavihara. Strange though it may now seem in such an overwhelmingly Muslim country, Buddhism has been no small player in the nation's history and culture. Most of the followers of Buddhism in Bangladesh live in the Chittagong division. Here, Buddhism is practised by the Bengali-speaking Baruas, who are almost exclusively Buddhist and are concentrated heavily in the Chittagong area as well as few of the Barua Buddhists live in other parts of Bangladesh, such as Comilla, Mymensingh, Rangpur, Sylhet districts. Most of the followers of Buddhism in Bangladesh live in southeastern region, especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Chittagong and Comilla district. Most of the Buddhists of Chittagong Hill Tracts belong to the Chakma, Marma, Mru, Khumi, Bawm, Chak, Kuki, Murang, Tanchangya and Khiang tribes, who since time immemorial have practised Buddhism. Other tribal communities who practise animism, have come under some Buddhist influence. The beliefs and rituals of the Buddhist communities in this region are amalgamations of Buddhism and ancient animistic faiths. Buddha Purnima is the most widely observed festival among both Bengali Buddhists and Buddhist tribes. Christianity Holy Rosary's Church (Est.1677) in Dhaka Christianity arrived in what is now Bangladesh during the late sixteenth to early seventeenth centuries AD, through the Portuguese traders and missionaries. Christians account for approximately 0.4% of the total population and they are mostly urban community. Roman Catholicism is predominant among the Bengali Christians, while the remaining are mostly Baptist and others. Few followers of Christianity are also present among certain indigenous tribal communities such as Garo, Santal, Orao, Chakma, khasi, Lushei, Bawm etc. Other religions Sikhism Gurdwara Nanak Shahi at Dhaka There are approximately 100,000 people adhering to the religion of Sikhism. The presence of this religion goes back to the visitation of Guru Nanak in 1506‚Äì07 with some of his followers to spread Sikhism in the region of the present-day Bangladesh. When some Bengali people accepted this faith, a Sikh community was born. This community became bigger when almost 10,000 Sikhs came from India during the Bangladesh Liberation War. This community has made great progress in the country. Today there are almost 10 gurdwaras in Bangladesh. Among them only 7 are well-known, especially the Gurdwara Nanak Shahi beside the University of Dhaka in Dhaka, which was built in 1830, the oldest gurdwara in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has a small community of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Bah√° º√≠s have spiritual centres in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Barisal, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Jessore, Rangamati and other places. Bangladesh also has a tiny Brahmo Samaj community. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) and the Jehovah's Witnesses also exist in Bangladesh. Law, religion, and religious freedom Although Bangladesh initially opted for a secular nationalist ideology as embodied in its Constitution, the principle of secularism was subsequently replaced by a commitment to the Islamic way of life through a series of constitutional amendments and government proclamations between 1977 and 1988. During the eighties the state was designated exclusively Islamic. However, in 2010, the secularism of the 1972 Constitution was reaffirmed. The Government generally respects this provision in practice; however, some members of the Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, and Ahmadiyya communities experience discrimination. The Government (2001-2006), led by an alliance of four parties (Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, Islami Oikya Jote and Bangladesh Jatiyo Party) banned the Ahmadiyya literature by an executive order. Family laws concerning marriage, divorce, and adoption differ depending on the religion of the person involved. There are no legal restrictions on marriage between members of different faiths. In 2010, secularism was restored, but Islam remains the nominal state religion per Article 12. Persecution of minorities There have been several instances of violence against the religious minorities in Bangladesh. Hindus, Buddhists and Christians have come under widespread attacks by Islamist extremists during communal riots, elections and post-poll violence. Most of these attacks target Hindus, the largest minority of the country, who are particularly vulnerable in a period of rising violence and extremism, whether motivated by religious, political or criminal factors, or some combination. Bangladesh has been rocked by several anti-Hindu riots in 1992, 2001, 2013 and 2014. These violences included attacking and killing Hindus, looting and burning of Hindu-owned properties and businesses, abduction and rape of women, desecrating and destroying Hindu temples by the extremist Muslim mobs. There are also alleged discrimination against Hindus by the administration in the form of Vested Property Act by which over 40% of Hindu-owned lands and houses have been confiscated, intimidation during elections and revoking their names from electoral rolls. Since the rising of Islamist political parties during 1990s, large number of Hindu families have migrated from Bangladesh to India due to a sense of insecurity and economic necessity. These factors combined with lower birth rates of minorities have resulted in a dwindling Hindu population in the country. The Bihari ethnic minority in Bangladesh has been subject to persecution during and after 1971 Liberation War. Due to their pro-Pakistan stance, many Biharis were forcefully repatriated to Pakistan and those who stayed back were not granted citizenship and voting rights by Bangladesh government. Atheism Atheism is not common in Bangladesh. According to a 2014 WIN/GIA survey, 5% of respondents from Bangladesh identified as \\"not religious\\", while less than 1% reported being a \\"convinced atheist\\". There have been multiple attacks and murders of atheist bloggers, academics and authors by Islamist militants since 2013, with the government accused of being unable or unwilling to provide protection ‚Äì and in some cases even persecuting atheists and imprisoning them.

The Sharchops, descendants of the country's probable original inhabitants, live in the east. Reportedly, some Sharchops practice Buddhism combined with elements of Bon whereas others practice animism and Hinduism. The government supports both Kagyu and Nyingma Buddhist monasteries. The royal family practices a combination of Nyingma and Kagyu Buddhism and many citizens believe in the concept of \\"Kanyin-Zungdrel,\\" meaning \\"Kagyupa and Ningmapa as one.\\" Hinduism Hindus, mainly in the South, practice Hinduism. There are about 200,000 Hindus mainly of Lhotshampa ethnicity living in Bhutan. They form 23% of the country's population, and Hinduism is the second largest religion of the nation. The very first Hindu temple was constructed in Thimphu in 2012 by the Je Khenpo, Chief Abbot of Bhutan, and Hindus practice their religion in small to medium-sized groups. Hinduism is more common among the Lhotshampa ethnic group, although a fair amount of ethnic Lhotshampa follow Buddhism as well. Bon Bon, the country's animist and shamanistic belief system, revolves around the worship of nature and predates Buddhism. Although B√∂n priests often officiate and include B√∂n rituals in Buddhist festivals, very few citizens adhere exclusively to this religious group. Christianity Christians are present in small numbers, especially in the Nepalese ethnic group. According to a 2007 report there were no Christian missionaries in the country, although international Christian relief organizations and Roman Catholic Jesuit priests engaged in education and humanitarian activities. Christianity was first brought to Bhutan in the late 17th century by Portuguese Jesuits, but the teachings failed to gain much traction among the devout Buddhists of the Bhutanese people. Islam In 2010, the Pew Research Center estimated that 0.5% of the population were Muslims and Islam has no recognization there according to Bhutan constitution.Pew Research Center - Global Religious Landscape 2010 - religious composition by country. Freedom and regulation of religion The law provides for freedom of religion; the religious institutions and personalities have a duty \\"to promote the spiritual heritage of the country while also ensuring that religion remains separate from politics\\" and that religious institutions and personalities remain \\"above politics.\\" Reflecting the government's stated purpose of preserving individuals' religious and cultural values, the above prohibitive clauses in the Constitution have been interpreted to apply to proselytism and to prohibit religious personalities from voting, respectively. The Religious Organizations Act of 2007 aims to protect and preserve the spiritual heritage of Bhutan through providing for the registration and administration of religious organizations. To meet those goals, the Act creates the Chhoedey Lhentshog as the regulatory authority on religious organizations. This body regulates, monitors, and keeps records on all religious organizations in Bhutan, which are in turn required to register and maintain specified corporate formalities. Through 2007, there were no reports of violence associated with pressure to conform to Vajrayana beliefs. There were no reports of societal abuse or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.

He worked primarily with Radio Belize and is recognized as having brought that station to a position of prominence in the small Central American nation.  Biography  Coleman was born in Benque Viejo del Carmen to descendants of Honduran immigrants from Isla Roatan. Having attended primary school in Benque Viejo and high school in Belize City, he had been involved in the nationalist movement on the labour front, working with George Price and the General Workers' Union in the 1950s. He had also gotten a part-time job with Radio Belize as a temporary announcer. There, at first he had only been working in Spanish because his bosses thought he had not had the right accent for delivering an English-language newscast. However, he had received a certificate and a job as Labour Inspector but was fired a few months later after an altercation with a fellow employee. He fell back on his job at Radio Belize and within a decade had risen to become the voice of Belize, with a sometimes risque repartee of jokes and witticisms and a ready supply of listener approved music. About this time he married childhood sweetheart Carmen \\"Panchita\\" Aguallo; they had one son, current broadcaster with Positive Vibes FM Gerard Coleman. He also had a step granddaughter, Susan Hernandez, whom he loved very much like his own blood granddaughter. He often let her speak over the radio and pick songs for the playlist. Coleman also frequently performed at the former Bliss Institute, now Center for the Performing Arts. He died in 1994, at Radio Belize's ebb in Belize City, Belize, prior to the station's demise in 1998.  Radio style  Coleman was termed a perfectionist by some of his coworkers. But he always kept them- and listeners- on edge with his own brand of humor, much of it focused on unseen companion \\"Panchita\\", which many listeners thought represented his wife, though this was not the case. Among several bad habits was his lack of judgement with regard to time, some mornings barely making it to studios in downtown Belize City; and his rampant alcoholism, which only after several scares was repudiated in the late 1970s. Coleman succeeded because he represented the resiliency of Belizeans in the face of the many disasters affecting the nation as it struggled toward independence.  References  * Hunter, Fr.

He is best known for the directing One Nation Under God, a documentary on the ex-gay movement. Personal life and education Maniaci was born and raised in Long Island, New York. He attended Tufts University outside of Boston, Massachusetts and received a master's degree from New York University Film School in 1990. As of 2007, he was a member of the Directors of Photography Union, Local 600. Cinematography Maniaci's cinematography credits include Clean, Shaven (1993), Claire Dolan (1998) The Tao of Steve (2000), The Business of Strangers (2001), Party Monster (2003), Inside Deep Throat (2005), and Outsourced (2006). Charles Taylor from Salon said the cinematography of Party Monster \\"looks as atrocious as most digital video\\", though Maniaci was praised for the cinematography in Claire Dolan by its director Lodge Kerrigan, and by Ken Hollings from the British Film Institute. Maniaci has also done cinematography for many TV series, including Brotherhood, Allegiance, The Breaks and The Bold Type, and for several music videos and short films. When interviewed in 2000, Manianci commented on the disparaging styles in his films, saying \\"you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to say there‚Äôs a single person behind them. They're all really different looking ... Claire Dolan, for instance, is an incredibly formal art film with very precise, almost geometric sort of chrome-and-glass photography. It‚Äôs very voyeuristic. Whereas in The Opportunists the camera is invisible. The shots are carefully chosen, but the film is not about the camerawork. It doesn't call attention to itself.\\" Manianci describes his work as \\"highly adaptive. I try to create a look that‚Äôs appropriate for each film. It‚Äôs not about me attaching myself [to a project] and it becoming about me. It‚Äôs about me becoming part of it ‚Äì trying to figure out what that project wants to be.\\" Maniaci received the Hamptons International Film Festival Cinematography Award for Searching for Paradise (2002). One Nation Under God Of all the films he has worked on, the one most identified with Maniaci is One Nation Under God, about the ex-gay movement, in particular the Exodus movement. He was both co-producer and co- director for this 1993 documentary. Synopsis This film is about how lesbians and gay men try to become \\"ex-gay\\". The film focuses on one ex-ex-gay male couple, but also shows how through such techniques as the women wearing make-up and the men doing butch or macho mannerisms. It also includes black and white archival footage.Rotten Tomatoes synopsis of One Nation Under God It also goes in some historical background, for context. Yahoo describes it as \\"A documentary about the contemporary struggle for gay and lesbian civil rights, focusing on the religious, right-wing proliferation of curative therapies for homosexuality.\\" \\"Judge\\" Patrick Bromley at DVD Verdict gives a fuller synopsis.DVD Verdict review of One Nation Under God Critical response In 1993, Maniaci shared the Audience Award at the San Francisco Lesbian & Gay Film Festival for One Nation Under God.[International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival San Francisco, California www.frameline.org]PopcornQ - Planet Out web site Variety positively reviewed the film, and Yahoo films gives it an A-minus rating. PlanetOut Inc. gave it four stars, and described as a \\"riveting documentary (that) offers the most dynamic historical overview of gays and lesbians in modern American society since Before Stonewall.\\"PopcornQ review DVD Verdict and DVD Talk also gave positive reviews. The documentary was shown on the PBS television show, P.O.V. in 1994. The New York Times reviewed that showing on Channel 13 for the New York City market, giving a mixed blessing. The reviewer liked many parts, but demurred, \\"Unfortunately, One Nation Under God has a patchy, jumpy, overdone quality. The producers can't bear to leave bad enough alone: suddenly you find yourself watching homosexuals being rounded up by German Nazis. Nor can the producers resist some mushy proselytizing.\\" In concluding, he wrote, \\"A significant argument is advanced here that opinions about homosexuality have less to do with science than with religion, morals and politics. If the producers had been able to contain themselves, develop that argument in a more coherent way and make their case without decoration, One Nation Under God might have been a considerably more consequential work.\\" In her dissertation, Nancy Dawn Wadsworth called One Nation Under God the \\"best treatment I have seen on Christian ex-gay movements\\". Cultural impact One Nation Under God has become part of some academia studies in film studies. In an article entitled Bullets, Ballots and Bibles: Documenting the History of the Gay and Lesbian Struggle in America, scholar Bruce R. Brasell states the film \\"explores the recycling by religious fundamentalists of discredited psychiatric treatments from the Sixties, reparative theory, to 'cure' homosexuals today.\\"Bruce R.

Biography Dailey was born in Glenboig, Lanarkshire. He began his football career during the Second World War as an amateur with Wolverhampton Wanderers. After the war he returned home and signed for Third Lanark. When he arrived at Sheffield Wednesday from Scotland as an 18-year-old, the team were struggling. He scored seven goals in his first eight games to start their recovery. At the start of the following season he scored ten in seven weeks, including all five in a 5‚Äì2 defeat of Barnsley, but the club preferred Eddie Quigley and Clarrie Jordan. Dailey moved to Birmingham City for a not inconsiderable fee of ¬£10,000 in February 1949. The next season, 1949‚Äì50, he was top scorer with nine goals in 23 games for a poor side which finished at the bottom of the table, but after that he rarely played. After leaving Birmingham he went on to score freely in the lower divisions, notably with 74 goals in 176 League games for Workington, including a club all-time record 26 in 1956‚Äì57. At Rochdale he scored a goal every other game, which contributed to the club being placed in the Third Division on goal average when the Football League was reorganised in 1958. He later played non-league football in the south-west of England and managed Portland United and Dorchester Town. After leaving football he ran a sports shop in Weymouth. He retired to Spain but returned due to ill-health in 2001 and died in Weymouth the following year aged 74.

They include the Anglican Church of Kenya, Africa Inland Church, Full Gospel Churches of Kenya, and the Presbyterian, Reformed, Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Salvation Army, and Pentecostal churches. Kenya has by far the highest number of Quakers of any country in the world, with around 119,285 members. The Roman Catholic Church makes up 20.6% of the population, about 9.7 million Kenyans.

In 2016 two new dioceses were created within the Orthodox Archdiocese of Kenya, namely the Diocese of Nyeri and Mount Kenya, as well as the Diocese of Kisumu and West Kenya, both falling under the Archdiocese of Nairobi, which is since 2001 presided by Archbishop Makarios (Tillyrides).ENTHRONEMENT OF BISHOPS IN KENYA - MAY 2016.

A 2015 study estimates some 70,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism. Islam Islam is the religion of 10.91 percent of the population. Most Muslims in Kenya are Sunni, mostly of the Shafii rite. Approximately 8% are non-denominational Muslims, 7% percent identify themselves as Shia and about 4% identify themselves as Ahmadi Muslims, as well as a small proportion of Ibadism practitioners.Prevost, Virginie. \\"The Ibadis in the Region of the Indian Ocean. Section One: East Africa,(¬´Studies on Ibadism and Oman¬ª, 1).\\" (2015): 169-172. Muslims are concentrated mainly in the Coastal and North Eastern Regions. Nairobi has several mosques and a notable Muslim population. There are large and historically significant populations of Swahili Muslims on the coast (most notably in Mombasa, Lamu and Malindi), in the Western Province, and smaller numbers of Somali, Arab and South Asian Muslims. Religious Shari'ah courts, called Kadhi courts, are given jurisdiction over certain civil matters such as divorce and inheritance under the constitution of Kenya. Muslims have complained that they are targeted and discriminated against by the government, particularly since the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi and elsewhere. The religions subsiding in Kenya do not display the distinctions between the 42 cultures. They mainly display the traditions of the larger \\"umbrella\\" cultures. Traditional African religions Place of worship in Kisumu County African religions are typically based on natural phenomena and reverence to ancestors. The dead are presumed to merely transform into another state of being and capable of bringing good fortune or calamity to the living. Most religious rites are therefore centred on appeasing the dead through sacrifices and proper burial rites. The dead's wishes must also be followed to the letter. Followers of traditional Kikuyu religion believe Ngai resides on Mt. Kenya and say their prayers facing the mountain. Followers of traditional Mijikenda religion have their holy shrines in the forests where they offer sacrifices and pray. The Maasai, Turkana, Samburu and Pokot tribes also have significant numbers of persons adhering exclusively to traditional African religions. Hinduism Hindu temple in Nairobi. There are Hindus living in Kenya. The numbers are estimated to be around 60,287 people or 0.13% of the population. They are mainly located in the capital of Kenya, Nairobi, and other urban areas such as Mombasa, Eldoret, Thika and Kisumu. No religion In the 2019 Census, 755,750 people reported themselves as having \\"no religion\\". This is 1.6% of the total, making this group larger than the groups reporting themselves as traditionalists, Hindu or other religion. 73,253, 0.16%, reported that they did not know their religion. There is a stigma against people who are atheists in Kenya. A Gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 90% of Kenyans considered themselves \\"a religious person\\", 9% consider themselves \\"a non religious person\\", while 1% define themselves as \\"a convinced atheist\\", placing Kenya in top 10 religious populations in the world.  Buddhism  Since 1999, Buddhism has grown in Kenya. There are more than 1000 Buddhists in Kenya. Buddhism is also one of the fastest growing religions in Kenya.

Biography Bud Hawk, third from left, is presented with a command coin while visiting Naval Base Kitsap in 2007. Hawk was born in San Francisco, California, and grew up in the Rolling Bay area of Bainbridge Island, Washington. He graduated from Bainbridge High School in 1943 and joined the Army two weeks later from Bremerton, Washington. By August 20, 1944, Hawk was serving in Europe as a sergeant in Company E, 359th Infantry Regiment, 90th Infantry Division. During a German counterattack on that day, near Chambois, France, he was wounded in the right thigh while taking cover behind a tree. A German shell had penetrated the tree trunk. (\\"French apple trees aren't worth a darn,\\" he said in 1994.) Hawk continued to fight and, in order to direct the shots of friendly tank destroyers, he willingly exposed himself to intense enemy fire. For his actions during the battle, he was awarded the Medal of Honor on July 13, 1945. The medal was formally presented to him by President Harry Truman. Hawk recovered from his wounds and continued to serve in combat. He was wounded three more times before the end of the war, earning a total of four Purple Hearts. In 1945, Hawk returned from the war and then attended the University of Washington, graduating with a bachelor's degree in biology. For more than thirty years he worked as a teacher and principal in the Central Kitsap School District. On April 5, 2008, Hawk received the Medal of Honor flag in the Capitol rotunda in Olympia, Washington. He was presented the flag by Brigadier General Gordon Toney, commander of the Washington Army National Guard. Hawk said of his Medal of Honor: > What I did was not such a big thing. I never did anything more than the > people I served with. The [Medal of Honor] is a symbol and it stands for > service, everybody's service. I did it for the people who were there and > they were doing the same thing for me. Hawk was a compatriot of the Washington State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

One student senator, Ashley Miller, said that the UW already had many monuments to \\"rich, white men\\" (Boyington claimed partial Sioux ancestry and was not rich); another, Jill Edwards, questioned whether the UW should memorialize a person who killed others, summarized in the minutes as saying \\"she didn't believe a member of the Marine Corps was an example of the sort of person UW wanted to produce.\\"UW Senate minutes After its defeat, a new version of the original resolution was submitted that called for a memorial to all eight UW alumni who received the Medal of Honor after attending the UW.\\"A Resolution Calling a Memorial for UW Alumni awarded the Medal of Honor\\" , Resolution R-12-16, Associated Students of the University of Washington Student Senate, submitted 02/17/2006.

The vehicle is envisioned as a precursor to the Moller M400 Skycar. The M200G Volantor uses a system of eight computer-controlled fans to hover up to above the ground. Volantor is a term coined by Moller meaning \\"a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.\\" Design The M200G Neuera is a circular craft with seats in the middle for two passengers and a control panel. The vehicle is 3 feet (0.9 meters) tall and 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter. Eight Wankel rotary engines power eight enclosed fans. The fans allow for vertical take-off and landing and, once the vehicle is aloft, rely upon the ground effect to create a cushion of air that the vehicle sits upon while flying. The eight separate engines exist for redundancy, allowing the craft to continue flying if one engine goes out. If two engines go out, the craft will make a \\"survivable hard landing\\". The engines can be powered with gasoline, diesel or ethanol fuels. The computer system monitors stability and the vehicle has only two controls, one for speed and direction and the other for altitude. The computer system also prevents the machine from flying higher than above the ground. Per Federal Aviation Administration regulations, any vehicle which flies above 10 feet is regulated as an aircraft. The M200G Neuera is expected to be capable of travel over any terrain at speeds up to 50 mph (80 km/h). Moller intends to design smaller aircraft to conform with the FAA Light-sport aircraft category, among them a 200LS and 100LS.Moller International develops two new light-sport Skycars AirFramer, 30 January 2012. Accessed: 4 February 2012. History Paul Moller, the vehicle's inventor, has been working to bring a flying vehicle to the mass market for over five decades without success. News reports have been skeptical that the M200G vehicle will come to market, citing a case by the Securities and Exchange Commission which noted that in 1997 promotional materials for the Skycar had predicted 10,000 units sold by 2002. Moller and his team claim that over 200 test flights of the M200G Neuera have already been conducted, though these flights rely on ground effect and do not necessarily suggest significant movement toward the goals set forth for the flagship model, the Skycar M400. Moller had predicted they would have the M200G ready for sale by early 2008 with a goal of 250 units produced in the year, but this did not occur. Depending upon demand, the M200G could cost under US$100,000 according to the company. As of August 2007, Moller had not yet established if the vehicle will be regulated by the United States Federal Aviation Administration or the Department of Transportation. Moller International has a long record of making promises which are not fulfilled, which tends to generate skepticism about their claims. Criticism In a 2005 episode of the Discovery Channel television show MythBusters it was reported that more than US$200 million had gone into the development of the Skycar. Moller has been claiming to be attempting to build a flying car since 1974, constantly promising delivery dates that are just \\"around the corner\\" but the closest Moller has come to producing a vehicle that flies is the M200G Neuera, which has been demonstrated to hover outside of ground effect. He has not produced any evidence or figures to support the promised abilities, such as fuel economy equivalent to that of an automobile; indeed, each proposed model would use eight less fuel-efficient Wankel engines, each of which must maintain high RPMs even when idle.Paul Moller and his (non) flying car The only demonstration approaching flight was a \\"hover\\" test performed by a Skycar prototype that was tethered to a crane, which Moller claimed was \\"for insurance purposes\\".Test Each time the deadline approaches, Moller has postponed it. For example, since 2003, when he started taking presale deposits for the flagship model M400, the date for FAA certification promised to investors and buyers has been moved forward one year each year, and lastly stood at December 31, 2008.Purchase Skycar from Moller official website In 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Moller for civil fraud (Securities And Exchange Commission v. Moller International, Inc., and Paul S. Moller, Defendants) in connection with the sale of unregistered stock, and for making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of the company's flagship M400 Skycar. Moller settled this lawsuit by agreeing to a permanent injunction and paying $50,000.Securities And Exchange Commission v. Moller International, Inc., and Paul S. Moller, Defendants from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website In the words of the SEC complaint, \\"As of late 2002, MI's approximately 40 years' of development has resulted in a prototype Skycar capable of hovering about fifteen feet [4.5 m] above the ground.\\"Complaint: Moller International, Inc., and Paul S. Moller from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website Variants ;M200X :Effectively the prototype of the Flying saucer like Volantor and Neuera. Moller claims a performance of 100 mph (160 km/h), 900 miles (1,450 km) range, 8 low-emissions Wankel engines that run on a 70% (bio)ethanol and 30% water mixture; earlier models ran on gasoline. The ethanol/water fuel mixture reduces fire hazards, as it does not easily burn outside the engines. The water cools the engines from within, and the engines can use higher compression ratios and hereby make more power than with 100% ethanol. Because of the mixture, the engine fulfills California SULEV requirements.Aug 10, 2006, Business Wire: Rotapower Engine Achieves SULEV Emissions Goal Citat: \\"...The 530cc engine tested produced 22 hp at 4500 rpm with an air/fuel ratio of 20 and lambda of 1.35.

The ship was named after Field Marshal Albrecht von Roon. She was built at the in Kiel, being laid down in August 1902, launched in June 1903, and commissioned in April 1906. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of . Like many of the late armored cruisers, Roon was quickly rendered obsolescent by the advent of the battlecruiser; as a result, her career was limited. Roon served in I Scouting Group, the reconnaissance force of the High Seas Fleet, for the duration of her peacetime career, including several stints as the flagship of the group's deputy commander. During this period, the ship was occupied with training exercises and made several cruises in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1907, she visited the United States to represent Germany during the Jamestown Exposition. In September 1911 she was decommissioned and placed in reserve. Three years later, the ship was mobilized in August 1914 following the outbreak of World War I and assigned to III Scouting Group, serving initially with the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea. There, she escorted the main German fleet during the raid on Yarmouth in November and the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December, though she saw no action during either operation. She was transferred to the Baltic Sea in April 1915 and took part in several operations against Russian forces, including the successful attack on Libau in May and the failed attack on Riga in August. The threat of British submarines convinced the German command to withdraw old vessels like Roon by early 1916, and she was again decommissioned and eventually used as a training ship. Plans to convert her into a seaplane tender in 1918 came to nothing with the end of the war, and she was broken up in 1921. Design Plan and elevation of the Roon class The two Roon-class cruisers were ordered in 1902 as part of the fleet expansion program specified by the Second Naval Law of 1900. The two ships were incremental developments of the preceding s, the most significant difference being a longer hull; the extra space was used to add a pair of boilers, which increased power by and speed by . The launch of the British battlecruiser in 1907 quickly rendered all of the armored cruisers that had been built by the world's navies obsolescent. Roon was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as built and fully loaded. She was propelled by three vertical triple expansion engines, each driving a screw propeller, with steam provided by sixteen coal-fired water-tube boilers. The ship's propulsion system developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of on trials, falling short of her intended speed of . She carried up to of coal, which enabled a maximum range of up to at a cruising speed of . Roon had a crew of 35 officers and 598 enlisted men. She was armed with four SK L/40 guns arranged in two twin-gun turrets, one on either end of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of ten SK L/40 guns; four were in single-gun turrets on the upper deck and the remaining six were in casemates in a main-deck battery. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried fourteen SK L/35 guns, all in individual mounts in the superstructure and in the hull, either in casemates or open pivot mounts with gun shields. She also had four underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one in the stern, and one on each broadside. The ship was protected with Krupp cemented armor; the belt armor was thick amidships and was reduced to on either end. The main battery turrets had thick faces. Her deck was thick, connected to the lower edge of the belt by thick sloped armor. Service history Pre-war photo of SMS Roon, most likely taken during 1907 visit to US Roon was ordered under the provisional name as a replacement for the ironclad . The ship was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel under construction number 28. Her keel was laid down on 1 August 1902 and she was launched on 27 June 1903. At her launching ceremony, Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee christened the ship Roon after Field Marshal Albrecht von Roon. Fitting-out work then commenced, which included provisions for the cruiser to be used as a flagship, and Roon was commissioned into the German fleet on 5 April 1906. Her first commander was (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Fritz Hoffmann. The ship then began sea trials that lasted until 9 July; she joined I Scouting Group on 15 August, where she replaced the armored cruiser as the flagship of the deputy commander, KzS and Kommodore (Commodore) Raimund Winkler. Roon then participated in the annual fleet maneuvers held in late August and early September. Later that month, Hoffmann was replaced by (FK‚ÄîFrigate Captain) Oskar von Platen-Hallermund, who commanded the vessel for just a month before he was in turn relieved by KzS Karl Zimmermann. At the same time as Hoffmann's departure, Winkler also left his post, being replaced by KzS and Eugen Kalau vom Hofe, who transferred his flag to Friedrich Carl in October. She spent the following years participating in training exercises and cruises with the ships of I Scouting Group as well as the entire High Seas Fleet. This routine was interrupted in early 1907 when the ship was sent to the United States to participate in the Jamestown Exposition, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the arrival of colonists in Chesapeake Bay. Kalau von Hofe returned to Roon to lead the German delegation, which also included the light cruiser ; the two cruisers left Kiel on 8 April and crossed the Atlantic to Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving on 24 April. Two days later, the international fleet, which also included contingents from Great Britain, Japan, Austria-Hungary, France, Italy, and several other nations, held a naval review as part of the exposition. Following the ceremonies, Bremen was detached to remain on station in the Americas while Roon returned to Germany, arriving back in Kiel on 17 May. On her return, Kalau von Hofe shifted back to Friedrich Carl. Roon sometime before 1914 From 11 September to 28 October, Roon briefly resumed her role as deputy flagship; Friedrich Carl was at that time serving as the group flagship while Roons sister was being overhauled. Also in October, FK Friedrich Schrader took command of the ship. The ship went on a major cruise into the Atlantic Ocean from 7 to 28 February 1908 with the other ships of the scouting group. During the cruise, the ships conducted tactical exercises and experimented with using their wireless telegraphy equipment at long distances. They stopped in Vigo, Spain, to replenish their coal for the voyage home. On 5 March, Roon returned to flagship duty, with now (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Kalau von Hofe back aboard the ship. Another Atlantic cruise followed in July and August; this time, the cruise was made in company with the battleship squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Prince Heinrich, the fleet commander, had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued to the Atlantic. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. On 23 September, KAdm Jacobsen replaced Kalau von Hofe, and the following month FK Georg Scheidt took command of Roon. The year 1909 saw two more cruises in the Atlantic, the first in February with just the ships of I Scouting Group and the second in July and August with the rest of the fleet. On the way back to Germany, the fleet stopped in Spithead, Britain, where it was received by the Royal Navy. KzS Reinhard Koch relieved Jacobsen as the group deputy commander after the annual fleet maneuvers in September 1909 but on 1 October he transferred his flag to Yorck. The next two years passed uneventfully for Roon; apart from the typical training routine, she took part in a naval review for Kaiser Wilhelm II in September 1911, after which she was decommissioned on 22 September. World War I Roon (left) steaming astern of the High Seas Fleet Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Roon was mobilized for wartime service on 2 August and was initially assigned to II Scouting Group as the flagship of KAdm Gisberth Jasper. The ship's first wartime commander was KzS Johannes von Karpf. A series of reorganizations saw the ship transferred to IV Scouting Group to replace the armored cruiser and on 25 August IV Scouting Group was renamed III Scouting Group, Roon remaining as flagship. KAdm Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz replaced Jasper as the group commander. The following day, Roon and the rest of the group took part in a sortie into the eastern Baltic Sea in a failed attempt to rescue the light cruiser that had run aground in Russian territory. The operation was cancelled on 27 August when Rebeur-Paschwitz received word that Magdeburg had been scuttled to avoid capture by Russian forces. The group was stationed in the North Sea from 6 September to guard the German coast, interrupted by a short deployment to the Danish straits from 25 to 26 September after false reports of British warships attempting to pass through prompted the German command to send the cruisers on a patrol there. During their period in the North Sea, the cruisers were sent to escort the minelaying cruisers and and the auxiliary minelayer Kaiser as they laid the \\"Alpha\\" defensive minefield in the North Sea. The ships then escorted the main body of the High Seas Fleet during the raid on Yarmouth on 2‚Äì3 November. A month later, on 15‚Äì16 December, she participated in the bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. Along with the armored cruiser , Roon was assigned to the van of the High Seas Fleet, which was providing distant cover to Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers while they were conducting the bombardment. During the operation, Roon and her attached destroyers encountered the British screening forces; Roon came in contact with the destroyers and , but no gunfire was exchanged and the ships turned away. Following reports of British destroyers from Roon as well as from , Admiral von Ingenohl ordered the High Seas Fleet to disengage and head for Germany. At this point, Roon and her destroyers became the rearguard for the High Seas Fleet. Roon, by this time joined by the light cruisers and Hamburg, encountered Commander Loftus Jones' destroyers. Jones shadowed Roon for about 45 minutes, at which point Stuttgart and Hamburg were detached to sink their pursuers. Twenty minutes later, Roon signaled the two light cruisers and ordered them to abandon the pursuit and retreat along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet. In the meantime, Vice Admiral David Beatty received word of Roons location, and in an attempt to intercept the German cruisers, detached the battlecruiser to hunt the German ships down, while his other three battlecruisers followed from a distance. While still pursuing the retreating Germans, Beatty had become aware that the German battlecruisers were shelling Hartlepool, so he decided to break off the pursuit of Roon and turn towards the German battlecruisers. Operations in the Baltic Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 The German naval command decided that because Roon and the other armored cruisers of the III Scouting Group were slow and lacked thick enough armor, they were unsuitable for service in the North Sea where they would risk contact with the powerful British Grand Fleet. Therefore, on 15 April 1915, Roon and the rest of III Scouting Group were transferred to the Baltic, where they would face the significantly weaker Russian Baltic Fleet. The unit was dissolved and Roon and the other vessels were assigned to the Reconnaissance Forces of the Baltic, under the command of KAdm Albert Hopman. At the same time, FK Hans Gygas replaced Karpf, who in turn became the deputy commander of the unit and made Roon his flagship. On 30 April, the ship went into drydock in Kiel for an overhaul, returning to service for the attack on Libau on 7 May. On 11 May, the British submarine spotted Roon and several other ships en route to Libau, which had been recently captured by the German army. E9 fired five torpedoes at the German flotilla, all of which missed; two passed closely astern of Roon. Roon thereafter took part in a series of sorties into the central Baltic as far north as Gotska Sand√∂n on 13‚Äì16 May, 23‚Äì26 May, 2‚Äì6 June, 11‚Äì13 June, and 20‚Äì22 June. Karpf transferred to the light cruiser while Hopman relocated to Roon since the latter's flagship, the armored cruiser , was under repairs for a torpedo hit. Roon and L√ºbeck covered a minelaying operation with Albatross on 30 June that lasted through 2 July and resulted in the Battle of √Öland Islands. The light cruiser and three destroyers were escorting Albatross when they were attacked by the armored cruisers , , and the light cruisers and . Augsburg escaped while the destroyers covered the retreat of Albatross, which was severely damaged and forced to seek refuge in neutral Swedish waters. Roon joined L√ºbeck to relieve the beleaguered German destroyers. Upon arriving at the scene, Roon engaged Bayan, and L√ºbeck opened fire on Oleg. Shortly thereafter, the Russian cruiser , along with a destroyer, arrived to reinforce the Russian flotilla. In the following artillery duel, Roon was hit several times, and the German ships were forced to retreat. Later in July, as the German Army began to push further north from Libau, the naval command reinforced the naval forces in the Baltic to support the advance. The pre- dreadnought battleships of the IV Battle Squadron were transferred to the eastern Baltic and its commander, (Vice Admiral) Ehrhard Schmidt, was placed in command of the naval forces in the area. In August, the German fleet attempted to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces to aid the German Army advancing on the city. Elements of the High Seas Fleet were sent to strengthen the forces attempting to break into the gulf. The Germans made several attempts to force their way into the gulf during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga until reports of British submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation on 20 August. During these attacks, Roon remained outside the gulf and on 10 August, Roon and Prinz Heinrich shelled Russian positions at Zerel on the Sworbe Peninsula. There were several Russian destroyers anchored off Zerel; the German cruisers caught them by surprise and damaged one of them. One of the two Roon-class cruisers On 9 September, Hopman returned to Prinz Adalbert, allowing Roon to return to Kiel for an overhaul. Work was completed by mid-October and the ship returned to Libau on 18 October. Two days later, Hopman made her his flagship once again. The loss of Prinz Adalbert three days later to a British submarine convinced the German command that the threat of underwater weapons was too serious to continue to operate older vessels with insufficient protection, including Roon. Accordingly, on 15 January 1916, Hopman hauled down his flag, and two days later the ship left Libau to return to Kiel, where she was decommissioned on 4 February. Fate In November 1916, Roon was disarmed and converted into a training and accommodation ship. Stationed at Kiel, she served in this capacity until 1918. The German Navy had previously experimented with seaplane carriers, including the conversion of the old light cruiser Stuttgart early in 1918 for service with the fleet. Stuttgart could carry only two aircraft, which was deemed insufficient for fleet support. As a result, plans were drawn up to convert Roon into a seaplane carrier, with a capacity for four aircraft. The ship's main battery would have been removed and replaced with six 15 cm guns and six 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns; the large hangar for the seaplanes was to have been installed aft of the main superstructure. The plan did not come to fruition, primarily because the German Navy relied on zeppelins for aerial reconnaissance, not seaplanes. Roon was struck from the naval register on 25 November 1920 and scrapped the following year in Kiel-Nordmole.

Her maternal grandfather was Hugh Smith Thompson the Governor of South Carolina from 1882 to 1886. Early life Caroline attended the Spence School for girls from 1908 to 1914. For the next ten years she attended as well as taught at the Teachers College, Columbia University where she received a B.S. in 1924. Under the direction of William Heard Kilpatrick, professor of philosophy of education, her dissertation on the personality adjustment of schoolchildren earned her a Ph.D in 1929.  Career  Her interest in psychology and its message to teachers prompted her to travel to Vienna in the 1930s where she studied under the psychiatrist Carl Jung. This experience influenced her intellectual development so much that, although not a psychiatrist, she became a Fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association. Her interest shifted from new methods of teaching to examining the psychological forces that determine the psychological development of schoolchildren. She was the director of Mental Hygiene Institute at the New Jersey State Teachers College (Now Montclair State College) from 1930 to 1934. From 1934 to 1939 she led the study of adolescence for the Commission on Secondary School Curriculum of the Progressive Education Association. The results of this study she published in 1940 as Emotion and Conduct in Adolescence. She went on to become the director of the Institute for the Study of Personality Development which was renamed after her death to the Caroline B. Zachry Institute of Human Development. In 1942 she was appointed director of the Bureau of Child Guidance of the New York City Board of Education that lasted until her death three years later in 1945.

It is based on Mishima's short story Patriotism, published in 1960. Opening scroll In February 1936, Tokyo was placed under marital law following a coup d'etat executed by a group of young officers. They maintained that they were far more loyal to the emperor than the corrupt cabinet members they murdered. Lieutenant Takeyama was a member of this secret society, but it was decided that he should not participate in this coup d'etat. The others did not want to implicate him, because they knew how much he loved Reiko, his beautiful young bride. It seemed at first that the coup had been successful, but in a few days people began to look on it as a minor uprising soon to be quelled by an imperial injunction. Lieutenant Takeyama was still a member of the palace guard. The time when he would have to fight against his comrade-in-arms, to execute his closest friends as rebels, was drawing near. The Rite of Love and Death takes place on the Japanese Noh stage. Plot Chapter I - Reiko Reiko, the lieutenant's wife has seen in her husband's face his resolution to die as he leaves for the palace on the snowy morning following the coup d'etat. If he should fail to return alive, she is determined to follow him in death. As she gathers the keepsakes she will leave behind for her parents and friends, she calls up tender memories of her husband's love... While sitting under a kanji painting that displays the phrase \\"wholehearted sincerity\\" Reiko waits for the lieutenant to return to his abode. She paints a message saying \\"keepsakes from Reiko\\" and gathers her cherished figurines. She is aware that when he returns home they are to die together but the agonizing fear is sent away by the eternal bliss of their love. She conjures up the happy memories of their marriage and life together. In her mind, she sees the warm caress of his hands and is warmed by their memory. Chapter 2- the Lieutenant's Return Then at midnight, the snow still falling, Lieutenant Takeyama suddenly appears at the door. The guard has been changed and he explains that he is free until morning, when he must go to kill his comrade-in-arms. \\"But I just can't do it! I can't!\\" Takeyama, a dedicated soldier, cannot bear the thought of killing his close friends if he wishes to remain loyal to the emperor. The contradiction appalls him. As the descendant of a samurai family, the only honorable course left him is to die by morning to commit hara-kiri. \\"I know how you feel\\" Reiko says quietly. \\"And I will follow you wherever you go.\\" Takeyama is overjoyed. \\"Thank you. We'll go together to another world then. But please let me die first and then you follow. I mustn't fail.\\" Their involuntary smiles reflect an unfathomable mutual trust. Death is no longer terrifying. Reiko feels as she did on her wedding night. After participating in the Ni Ni Roku Incident of February 1936, Lieutenant Shinji Takeyama has been given orders to execute some of his fellow mutineers. Realizing he can not do it, he tells his wife of his plan to commit suicide. She agrees with him and they plan to commit it together. Chapter 3- the Final Love This is as pure and passionate as a ritual conducted before the gods. They are able for the first time in their lives to reveal unabashedly their most secret desires and passions. First the Lieutenant and then Reiko, who has lost all her shyness in the face of death, bids loving farewell to every smallest detail of the other's flesh. Accepting that they are about to die, Reiko and the Lieutenant make love. They are sent together in the deepest of ecstasies. As they copulate, Reiko kisses the flesh of the Lieutenant and many sensual shots show closeups of their naked bodies entwined. It's an abstract montage of faces, arms, and torsos in sometimes extreme close-up, recalling slightly Teshigahara.https://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/article/94221 The scene ends with them both reclined naked like Grecian statues. Chapter 4- the Lieutenant commits Hara-kiri The lieutenant commits hara-kiri with the assistance of his wife Reiko. As he stabs himself with the sword, spit forms in his mouth and his stomach lets loose a torrent of blood. Chapter 5- Reiko commits suicide Reiko now prepares herself to follow her husband into the next life. She puts on her lipstick and then sits next to her husband's corpse. She holds the knife with a smile on her face, glad to be reunited with her husband. The film ends with a shot of the dead couple in embrace. Style Patriotism is a silent, thirty-minute black-and-white film with long expository intertitles elaborating on the story and its historical background. It contains visual references to Noh theatre, as Mishima admired the traditional style and wrote several plays in the genre. Set in a single room, it is composed of static wide shots and lingering close-ups, most of which obscure Mishima's eyes. It's arresting visually: with cinematographer Watanabe Kimio, Mishima achieves an extremely sharp contrast of black and white, emblazoned by the ensuing copious amounts of blood, and the whiteness of the Noh stage and Reiko's ceremonial kimono, respectively.https://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/article/94221 The hanging painting that displays \\"Wholesome sincerity\\" also acts as a major visual element of the film's visual style, determining angle, lighting, actor positions. And like the entire film itself, it remains mute but steady, fixed in its resolve. It serves to remind the viewer of the devotion between Reiko and the Lieutenant and also their devotion to their nation and to the ritual hara-kiri. Themes The film is about the death of militarism in postwar Japan and seeks to contrast the suicide of the 1936 officers to Mishima's postwar interpretation. It can be seen as a foreshadowing of his own ill-fated suicide.http://www.aems.illinois.edu/publications/lessonplans/chalk/chalk_16.html Ritual suicide is explored in many of Mishima's works. Following Mishima's death aesthetics, the excruciating gorey shots of death make the point, so that an overwhelming sense of life, beauty, discipline, love, and death come together.https://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/article/94221 Cast * Yukio Mishima as Lieutenant Shinji Takeyama * Yoshiko Tsuruoka as Reiko Release Patriotism was originally distributed in Japan by Japan Art Theatre Guild on 12 April 1966. It was released theatrically again by Toho and Japan Art Theatre Guild on 15 June 1966. The film was shot in two days in secret, and after a private screening, then submitted for a French film festival.http://blogs.dickinson.edu/japaneseliteratureintofilm/2016/03/19/patriotism- the-rite-of-love-and-death/ On November 25, 1970, Mishima committed seppuku after delivering a speech intended to inspire a coup d'√©tat.

Yorck was named for Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, a Prussian field marshal. She was laid down in 1903 at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, launched in May 1904, and commissioned in November 1905. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed was . Like many of the late armored cruisers, Yorck was quickly rendered obsolescent by the advent of the battlecruiser; as a result, her career was limited. Yorck spent the first seven years of her career in I Scouting Group, the reconnaissance force for the High Seas Fleet, initially as the group flagship. During this period, the ship was occupied with training exercises and made several cruises in the Atlantic Ocean. Yorck was involved in a number of accidents, including an accidental explosion aboard the ship in 1911 and a collision with a torpedo boat in 1913. In May 1913, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. She was thereafter mobilized and assigned to III Scouting Group. On 3 November, she formed part of the screen for the High Seas Fleet as it sailed to support a German raid on Yarmouth; on the return of the fleet to Wilhelmshaven, the ships encountered heavy fog and anchored in the Schillig Roads to await better visibility. Believing the fog to have cleared sufficiently, the ship's commander ordered Yorck to get underway in the early hours of 4 November. The ship entered a German minefield in the haze, struck two mines, and sank with heavy loss of life. The wreck was dismantled progressively between the 1920s and 1980s to reduce the navigational hazard it posed. Design Plan and elevation of the Roon class The two Roon-class cruisers were ordered in 1902 as part of the fleet expansion program specified by the Second Naval Law of 1900. The two ships were incremental developments of the preceding s, the most significant difference being a longer hull; the additional space was used to add a pair of boilers, which increased horsepower by and speed by . The launch of the British battlecruiser in 1907 quickly rendered all of the armored cruisers that had been built by the world's navies obsolescent. Yorck was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as built and fully loaded. The ship had a crew of 35 officers and 598 enlisted men, though this was frequently augmented with an admiral's staff during periods where the ship served as a flagship. She was propelled by three vertical triple-expansion steam engines, with steam provided by sixteen coal-fired water-tube boilers. The ship's propulsion system developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of on trials, falling short of her intended speed of . She carried up to of coal, which enabled a maximum range of up to at a cruising speed of . She was armed with four SK L/40 guns arranged in two twin-gun turrets, one on either end of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of ten SK L/40 guns; four were in single-gun turrets on the upper deck and the remaining six were in casemates in a main-deck battery. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried fourteen SK L/35 guns, all in individual mounts in the superstructure and in the hull. She also had four underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one in the stern, and one on each broadside. The ship was protected with Krupp cemented armor, with the belt armor being thick amidships and reduced to on either end. The main battery turrets had thick faces. Her deck was thick, connected to the lower edge of the belt by thick sloped armor. Service history Construction ‚Äì 1908 An unidentified Roon-class cruiser Yorck was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz and built at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 167. Her keel was laid down on 25 April 1903 and she was launched on 14 May 1904. General Wilhelm von Hahnke gave a speech at the launching ceremony and the vessel was christened Yorck after Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, a Prussian general during the Napoleonic Wars by Josephine Yorck von Wartenburg, one of his descendants. Fitting-out work was completed by late 1905, when the ship began builder's trials, after which a shipyard crew transferred the vessel to Kiel, where she was commissioned into the fleet on 21 November. After her commissioning, Yorck served with the fleet in I Scouting Group, which she formally joined on 27 March 1906. On 2 April, she replaced the armored cruiser as the group flagship, under the command of Vizeadmiral (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) Gustav Schmidt. Over the next several years, Yorck took part in the peacetime routine of training exercises with the fleet reconnaissance forces and with the entire High Seas Fleet, including major fleet exercises every autumn in late August and early September. On 29 September, Konteradmiral (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Hugo von Pohl replaced Schmidt as the group commander. After 1907's autumn maneuvers, Yorck went into drydock for an extensive overhaul from 11 September to 28 October, during which time Friedrich Carl temporarily replaced her as the flagship. While she was out of service, Pohl was replaced by KAdm August von Heeringen, who raised his flag aboard Yorck upon her return from the shipyard. The ship went on a major cruise into the Atlantic Ocean from 7 to 28 February 1908 with the other ships of the scouting group. During the cruise, the ships conducted various tactical exercises and experimented with using their wireless telegraphy equipment at long distances. They stopped in Vigo, Spain, to replenish their coal for the voyage home. On 1 May, the new armored cruiser joined I Scouting Group, replacing Yorck as the group flagship. Another Atlantic cruise followed in July and August; this time, the cruise was made in company with the battleship squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued to the Atlantic. Yorck stopped in Funchal in Madeira and A Coru√±a, Spain during the cruise. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Yorck won the Kaiser's Schie√üpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent shooting among armored cruisers for the 1907‚Äì1908 training year. During this period, Erich Raeder served as the ship's navigation officer. In October, Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Arthur Tapken took command of the ship; he served as the ship's commander until September 1909. 1909‚Äì1913 In February 1909, I Scouting Group went on another training cruise in the Atlantic; Yorck again stopped in Vigo from 17 to 23 February. After the ships' return to Germany, Scharnhorst was detached to the East Asia Squadron on 11 March, vacating the flagship role, which Yorck again filled. Heeringen and the command staff returned to the ship the same day. The cruisers joined the High Seas Fleet for another Atlantic cruise in July and August, and Yorck visited Vilagarc√≠a de Arousa from 18 to 26 July. On the way back to Germany, the fleet stopped in Spithead, Britain, where it was received by the Royal Navy. By early 1910, the new armored cruiser was ready for service with the fleet, and so now-VAdm Heeringen hauled down his flag from Yorck on 25 April and transferred to the new vessel two days later. Yorck thereafter became the flagship of KAdm Reinhard Koch, the deputy commander of the group. Already on 16 May, Koch was replaced by KAdm Gustav Bachmann, who was in turn replaced by KAdm Maximilian von Spee on 15 September when Bachmann succeeded Heeringen as the group commander. Yorck won the Schie√üpreis for the 1909‚Äì1910 year. KzS Ludwig von Reuter served as the ship's commander from September 1910. While in the shipyard for maintenance on 31 March 1911, a benzene explosion in the ship's aft-most boiler room killed one man and injured several, preventing Yorck from taking part in unit maneuvers. On 1 October, KzS and Kommodore (Commodore) Franz von Hipper replaced Spee, after which the ship joined a cruise to Norway and Sweden in November. She visited Uddevalla, Sweden from 3 to 6 November during the cruise. Yorck did not take part in the unit maneuvers conducted in February 1912. In March, Yorck and four light cruisers filled I Scouting Group's role during fleet exercises, and during the maneuvers now-VAdm Bachmann came aboard Yorck to direct their participation. During the exercises, Hipper temporarily transferred his flag to the new battlecruiser , but returned thereafter until 28 August. In September, Fregattenkapit√§n (Frigate Captain) Max K√∂thner replaced Reuter as the ship's captain, though he served in the role only briefly before departing in November. The ship suffered an accident on 2 November when one of her pinnaces accidentally detonated a naval mine, killing two men and injuring two more. Yorck was involved in another serious accident on 4 March 1913 during training exercises off Helgoland. The torpedo boat attempted to pass in front of the ship but failed to clear her in time; Yorcks bow tore a hole into S178 that flooded her engine and boiler rooms. S178 sank within a few minutes of the accident and 69 men were killed in the accident. Yorck, the battleship , and the torpedo boat were only able to pull fifteen men from the sea. Yorck was only slightly damaged in the accident and continued with the maneuvers. KAdm Felix Funke and Bachmann alternated periods aboard Yorck, with Funke flying his flag from 7 to 14 March, followed by Bachmann from 14 March to 1 May, and finally Funke from 1 to 17 May. Yorck thereafter steamed to Kiel, where on 21 May she was decommissioned, the last armored cruiser to serve with I Scouting Group. She thereafter underwent an overhaul and was placed in reserve. Most of her crew transferred to the newly completed battlecruiser . World War I Yorck underway, c. 1914 Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Yorck was mobilized for wartime service; she was recommissioned on 12 August. Initially assigned to IV Scouting Group, on 25 August she was transferred to III Scouting Group, under the command of KAdm Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz. Beginning on 20 September, she was tasked with guarding the German Bight. The ships of III Scouting Group transferred temporarily to the Baltic Sea two days later for a sortie into the central Baltic, as far north as √ñstergarn, from 22 to 29 September. They then returned to the North Sea and rejoined the High Seas Fleet. On 3 November, Yorck participated in the first offensive operation of the war conducted by the German fleet. I Scouting Group, by now commanded by RAdm Hipper, was to bombard Yarmouth on the British coast while the bulk of the High Seas Fleet sailed behind, providing distant support in the event that the raid provoked a British counterattack. Yorck and the rest of III Scouting Group provided the reconnaissance screen for the main fleet. Hipper's ships inflicted little damage and minelayers laid minefields off the coast, which later sank the British submarine . Upon returning to Wilhelmshaven late that day, the German ships encountered heavy fog that prevented them from safely navigating the defensive minefields that had been laid outside the port. Instead, they anchored in the Schillig roadstead. Yorcks commander, KzS Pieper, believed the fog to have cleared sufficiently to allow the vessel to return to port, so he ordered the ship to get underway. The pilot refused to take responsibility for maneuvering the ship owing to the great danger of trying to pass through the minefields under the foggy conditions. At 04:10, Yorck struck a mine and began to turn to exit the minefield, striking a second mine shortly thereafter. She quickly sank with heavy loss of life, though sources disagree on the number of fatalities. The naval historian V. E. Tarrant states that 127 out of a crew of 629 were rescued, while Erich Gr√∂ner indicates that there were only 336 deaths. The naval historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert R√∂hr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz concur with Gr√∂ner on the number of fatalities and note that 381 men, including Pieper, were rescued by the coastal defense ship . For his reckless handling of the ship, Pieper was tried in a court-martial, convicted, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment for negligence, disobedience of orders, and homicide through negligence. The wreck, located between Horumersiel and Hooksiel, was initially marked to allow vessels to pass safely. Beginning in 1926, the wreck was partially scrapped to reduce the navigational hazard to deeper-draft vessels. More work was done in 1936‚Äì1937 for the same reason. During a series of construction programs to expand the entrance to the Jade after World War II, the ship's turrets were removed in 1969 and the remaining parts of the hull were demolished in 1983 to further clear the sea floor.

A medical response dog is a service dog trained to assist an individual who has a medical disability. Typically, they are dogs whose job does not handle primarily epilepsy or psychiatric-based conditions, though some seizure response dogs or psychiatric service dogs may also be referred to as medical response. Many medical response dogs \\"alert\\" their handlers to conditions before they occur. For example, diabetes alert dogs partnered with diabetic persons may be trained to detect when the handler's blood sugar becomes too high or low. In addition to or in the absence of this training, medical response dogs are also often trained skills to help in their handlers' symptoms, such as bringing medications or a telephone, providing bracing and other mobility assistance, or any other number of tasks.http://www.iaadp.org/psd_tasks.html A list of example tasks for psychiatric service dogs on the International Association of Assistance Dog Partners' website. Many medical response dogs may be trained by an organization or by their handler. Like all assistance dogs, they must be of a particular work-loving personality and be properly socialized if expected to work in public. There are no breed or size restrictions other than those directly related to the tasks needed. The allowed public accessibility of medical response dogs varies from region to region. In general, areas with laws protecting the usage of guide dogs and other assistance dogs, such as in the United States, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 also cover medical response dogs as well.

It is the most used station in the city, and was originally planned to be a station on the cancelled extension of the Orange Line to Reading. The station is accessible. History Melrose Highlands station around 1908 The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) opened its line from Wilmington Junction to Boston on July 1, 1845. Stoneham station opened on Franklin Street in the east part of Stoneham then or soon thereafter. In 1853, the east part of Stoneham was annexed into Melrose (itself split from Malden in 1850 due to development around the rail line) and soon renamed Melrose Highlands. Unusually, the B&M; did not rename the station - likely to compete with the rival Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&L;) for Stoneham traffic. (The B&L; had its Montvale station slightly closer to downtown Stoneham, and opened the Stoneham Branch directly to the town in 1862.) The B&M; leased the entire B&L; system in 1887, ending the competition. The station was soon renamed as Melrose Highlands, though the Stoneham name was still locally used for some time thereafter. The original station was on the west side of the tracks just south of Franklin Street. In 1903, the B&M; built a larger station just north of Franklin Street. The station was demolished in the 1950s or 1960s. The MBTA, formed in 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter rail service, began funding Reading Line service on January 18, 1965. Mini-high platforms on the north end of each platform opened in January 2006, making the station accessible.

It is part of the Lisbon metropolitan area. The population in 2011 was 48,629,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 24.36 km¬≤. History The parish was first mentioned in 1384 in the Chronicles of John I, a work of Fern√£o Lopes. From this period apparently dates the first population settlement in the area, which was located in Cheira Ventos, in the present day area of Talaminho. The parish was elevated to the status of town on 30 June 1989, and city on 20 May 1993. Amora has a privileged geographic position, with a large area supported by two arms of the Tagus River (one that ends in the northeast, in Corroios, and another in the south, at Torre da Marinha), that facilitate contact to exterior by river. Overland it was always a point of passage between Cacilhas and the south (Azeit√£o, Set√∫bal and Sesimbra), functioning as a corridor that connected the capital to the south. Much like many of the other settlements of Seixel, Amora's origins and development were the result the Tagus estuary, since the Middle Ages. It was the Tagus that united the communities, that included seamen, bushmen, millers, workers and laundresses, since the 18th century, but its history extends back to the 14th century. In 1384, Fern√£o Lopes, referred to this settlement as the location of galleys of the Master of Avis, situated on the arms of the Tagus, between Seixel, Arrentela and Amora, during the Castillian battles. Documents from the 16th and 18th centuries refer to the concentration of inhabitants around Cheira Ventos, later known as Amora Velha. But, continued settlement meant the extension of settlements along the river, resulting in the creation of several other urban nuclei: Amora de Baixo, at the rivers edge, and Amora de Cima, alongside the parochial church, in addition to many of the noble estates that were scattered throughout the ecclesiastical parish. Economically, the parish during the Middle Ages was dominated by vineyards, firewood and forest stock, that extended until Arr√°bida, then part of Coutada, referred to in 1381 by King Ferdinand. There were references to several estates and vineyards within the boundary of Amora, including Va√≠le de Pessegueiro, Vinha do Pinhal, Fonte da Prata, Va√≠le de Loba, Valle de Crespim, Cascalheira, Caza de P√£o. The wine produced in the fields of Amora was of an excellent quality, by the beginning of the 16th century, from remarks of Garcia de Resende and Gil Vicente, and Gaspar Frutuoso, who remarked that they were the best in the Kingdom, and whose vintages were regularly exported. Until 1836, Amora was part of the municipality of Almada, when the municipality of Seixal was created, that included Seixal, Arrentela and Paio Pires. In 1895, when Seixal was extinguished, during the Liberal reforms of Mouzinho de Silveira, Amora once again became part of Almada, a fact that persisted for a short time (until 1898). By 1976, the territory of Corroios was deannexed from Amora to function as an independent parish. Geography Train in Amora Amora, is one of the three civil parishes of the municipality of Seixal, integrated into the metropolitan area of Lisbon, along the south margin of the Tagus estuary. It is bordered on the west by the parish of Corroios, east by the parishes of Seixal, Arrentela and Fern√£o Ferro, while on the south by the municipality of Sesimbra. There are several individual localities and small towns that dot the landscape of Amora, including: * Amora * Belverde * Cruz de Pau * Fogueteiro * Foros de Amora * Medideira * Paivas * Pinhal Conde da Cunha * Quinta da Princesa * Soutelo * Vale de Gatos Amora is crossed by important road networks, including the A2 motorway and the Estrada Nacional 10. It has two railway stations on the Fertagus line from Lisbon to Set√∫bal: Fogueteiro and Foros de Amora. Economy Owing to its location on the banks of the Rio Judeu (a tributary of the Tagus), the urbanized city developed a noted sea- based industry involved in naval repairs and construction, fishing and other related industries. Since then, the community has developed into a bedroom community of the much larger Lisbon agglomeration; thousands of residents travel between the capital and Seixal, which have a lower cost of living and expanded infrastructures/services.

Early years Albert Johnson was born into a prominent family in Oberlin, Ohio. He was the son of Albert Harrison Johnson (1838-1899) and his wife Rebecca A. Jenkins (1842-1915). Johnson's father was an extremely wealthy man who owned several banks, a utility company, and a few stone quarries in the vicinity of Oberlin. He was also President of the Arkansas Midland Railroad Company, which was based in Helena, Arkansas. Although records of Albert M. Johnson's early life are frequently contradictory and uncertain, it is known that he was given a very religious upbringing. It has been asserted numerous times that Johnson was raised a Quaker, but some sources indicate that due to the close affiliation between Johnson's grandparents and John Shipherd, Presbyterian minister and founder of Oberlin College it is far more likely Johnson's family was Presbyterian or Congregationalist. Either way, however, Johnson lived a devout lifestyle and was a lifelong non-smoker and teetotaler. Johnson attended Oberlin college for one year before transferring to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. While a student in the civil engineering program at Cornell, Albert met and fell in love with Bessie Penniman, a fellow student at Cornell, and the daughter of a wealthy fruit and nut rancher from Walnut Creek, California. Albert Johnson graduated from Cornell in 1895, and a year later married Bessie. Not long after his marriage to Bessie, Johnson borrowed $40,000 from his father to invest in a lead-zinc mine in Missouri, which turned out to be an extremely profitable investment. Flush with cash and success, Johnson prevailed upon his father to travel with him out to the Wild West to inspect more mining claims for possible further investment. The trip was ill-fated, however, and in December, 1899, while riding on a train on the Denver and Rio Grande line near Salida, Colorado, Albert Johnson and his father were victims of a terrible train accident. The Johnsons' train was struck from the rear by another train, and Albert Johnson's father was killed as he slept. Albert Johnson himself suffered from a broken back, for which he was given an initial prognosis of certain and imminent death, as well as lifelong paralysis below the waist. Albert Johnson made a near-miraculous recovery, regaining his ability to walk within eighteen months, and living for well over forty years past the accident. He never quite returned to full health, however, and walked with a limp for the rest of his life, which he took great pains to disguise. In 1902, after his recovery, Johnson moved to Chicago, Illinois, to join his father's former business partner, Edward A. Shedd (Shedd Aquarium, still standing on Chicago's Lake Michigan today), in taking over some of his father's business interests as well as establishing new ones of his own. Shedd and Johnson jointly purchased the National Life Insurance Company at a foreclosure sale. Through a bargain with Shedd, Albert Johnson acquired 90% of publicly available National Life stock, and quickly became President of the company. Johnson's annual salary as President of National Life Insurance was said to have been approximately $1,000,000. Johnson and Death Valley Scotty Albert Johnson and Edward Shedd were approached in 1904 by a man named Obadiah Sands, who was acting as an intermediary for Walter E. Scott, also known as Death Valley Scotty, a man notorious for his story of having discovered a mysterious gold mine in Death Valley. Scotty was often soliciting wealthy investors to grubstake his supposed mining operation, and Johnson and Shedd were no exceptions. For an initial investment of $2,500, Scotty offered the pair a two-thirds interest in any mines he discovered in Death Valley. Scotty then offered Obadiah Sands a 20% interest in the mine as a reward for having acted as an intermediary. Johnson and Shedd split their two-thirds interest evenly between them. By 1906, Johnson and Shedd had begun to notice the distinct lack of a return on their investment. Johnson banded together with a few more of Scotty's investors and purchased train tickets out to Death Valley so they could inspect Scotty's findings themselves. Scotty and his brother Warner collected his visitors and brought them out to a wash in Death Valley where some of Scotty's friends had hidden themselves, disguised as bandits to scare off the investors before they discovered that Scotty's mine was fictitious. In the ensuing mock gunfight, popularly known as \\"The Battle of Wingate Pass\\", Warner was shot and badly injured, prompting Scotty to call the whole thing off in order to go to Warner's assistance. By the time the shooting stopped, most of Scotty's investors realized they'd been fooled and pulled out of Scotty's scheme. Johnson, however, felt that there might still be a chance that Scotty had found gold and decided to pursue the matter further. After returning home to Chicago, Johnson hired Alfred MacArthur, who worked as a General Agent of the National Life Insurance Company, to go out to Death Valley and follow Scotty day and night until he discovered whether or not Scotty had a mine. Scotty tried to fool his pursuer by planting gold ore in an exhausted mine shaft, but MacArthur was not convinced. MacArthur sent a telegram to Albert Johnson to inform him of Scotty's dishonesty, and thus exploded the myth of a gold mine. In spite of this and other independent confirmations that Scotty's mining scheme had no substance to it, Johnson persisted in his belief that Scotty really had found gold in Death Valley. Beginning in 1909, Johnson made many trips out to Death Valley to visit Scotty in the hopes of finally being shown the gold mine he had been promised. Although it is almost certain that Johnson realized after a few years that the gold mine did not exist after all, he continued his trips to visit Scotty, as he had learned to enjoy Death Valley as well as Scotty's company. Later years In 1915, Johnson purchased a ranch at Grapevine Canyon in what is now Death Valley National Park from a man named Jacob Steininger, and in 1916 began building the first of many structures he constructed on the property, a small shack that he and Death Valley Scotty used for camping. After Albert Johnson spent several winters of desert vacations with Scotty, Bessie began to grow curious about Death Valley and its attraction her husband had for it.Albert Johnson is flanked by his wife Bessie (left) and a nurse, who hold the crutches he required during his recovery from the train accident. Bessie began to accompany Albert, but after a year or two decided that though she also found Death Valley appealing, she was not content to sleep on the ground in a dirty tent or shack. In 1922, to mollify his wife, Albert Johnson began constructing what was eventually to become Scotty's Castle. In 1927 Johnson purchased more land in Grapevine Canyon from Fred M. Sayre and his wife Vida L. Sayre, and also from Beveridge Hunter and his wife Ruth, bringing the total size of his Death Valley Ranch to approximately . Johnson's health In spite of his speedy and remarkable recovery from the spinal injury he received in the train accident in 1899, Albert Johnson continued to feel the effects of his injury for the rest of his life. Although he regained the ability to walk, he suffered from partial paralysis below the waist, specifically paralysis of the excretory organs. His paralysis was such that Johnson was forced to catheterize himself multiple times every day to assist in his ability to urinate, and keep meticulous records of his daily fluid intake and output in order to monitor his own health. There is also some speculation that Johnson was also forced to carry a colostomy bag with him for the rest of his life, based on the observations of a few of his friends that Johnson frequently wore clothing that was too baggy for him, possibly to disguise certain side effects of his injuries. Television depiction Johnson was portrayed by actor William Schallert in the 1955 episode, \\"Death Valley Scotty,\\" on the syndicated television anthology series Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Johnson was the benefactor of Walter E. Scott, played by Jack Lomas (1911-1959). In 1905, Scott commissioned the \\"Scott Special,\\" a passenger train of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The steam locomotive Santa Fe No. 1010 was used to re-create the record-setting 44-hour railroad run from Los Angeles to Chicago. It was especially reconditioned for filming.

Lowell L. Bennion, the institute director, helped them prepare a constitution and organized them as \\"Alpha House\\" in October 1936, followed by \\"Omega House\\" for women in December. Shortly afterward, these houses were collectively named Lambda Delta Sigma, which would be a co-educational Greek society open to anyone willing to uphold Latter-day Saint ideals.

In November 1967, this new Lambda Delta Sigma was approved at the first National Convention of the LDSSA. In 1977, the sorority was transferred to the leadership of the Relief Society General Presidency and the national LDS President served on the General Relief Society Board and by 1982, all Lambda Delta Sigma officers gained National Board positions.

Many musicians and composers have presumably adorned the courts of the Mysore kings from Yaduraya's time, furthering the Dakshinadi school (southern school) of music that had developed in earlier centuries. However, records are only available from the time of King Ranadheera Kanteerava Narasaraja Wodeyar (1638).Pranesh (2003), pix in author's noteKamath (2001), p282 Musical treatises surviving from this time, though, provide ample information on the music, musical instruments, the types of compositions, the raga (melodies) and the tala (rhythms) used. Though all the Mysore kings patronised music, the golden age of Carnatic music was considered to be during the reigns of Kings Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1794‚Äì1868), Chamaraja Wodeyar IX (1862‚Äì1894), Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV (1884‚Äì1940) and Jaya Chamaraja Wodeyar (1919‚Äì1974).

Instruments such as the harmonium, the sitar and the jaltarang, though uncommon to the southern region, came into use and British influence popularised the saxophone and the piano. The royalty of this dynasty were noted composers and proficient in playing musical instruments both solo and in concert with others.Pranesh (2003), p54-55, p92, p162-163, p225-226 The different styles of compositions included jati swara, swara jati, varna, kriti, javali (a light lyric), tillana and pallavi. It was not unusual for the composers and the kings who patronised them to be experts at instrumental music as well. So proficient were the musicians at their chosen instrument(s) that the name of the instrument became a part of the musician's name, examples being Veena Subbanna and Veena Sheshanna, Veena (or Veene as it is known in South India) being their instrument.Pranesh (2003), p108 During these times, Tanjore in modern Tamil Nadu and Mysore in modern Karnataka were the centres of Carnatic music. Mysore developed a distinct school of music which gave importance to the raga and the bhava.Kamath (2001), p283 Though many of the musicians in the courts were natives of the Mysore Kingdom, artists from other parts of South India were also patronised. Another important development of this period was the growth of drama. These dramas, original or translated from English and Sanskrit classics, contained many melodious songs and were brought to the stage through the various drama schools established by royalty.Kamath (2001), p281 King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1794‚Äì1868) Mridangam This period heralded the beginning of British control over the administration of Mysore and the start of an important period in the development of vocal and instrumental Carnatic music in south India. King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III was a trained musician, musicologist and composer of merit. Being a devotee of the Hindu goddess Chamundeshwari, he wrote all his compositions under the mudra (pen name) \\"'Chamundi'\\" or \\"'Chamundeshwari'\\". He composed many philosophically themed javali (light lyric) and devotional songs in the Kannada language under the title Anubhava pancharatna. Javali in Carnatic music have their roots in Mysore and are first mentioned in the king's writings as javadi.Pranesh (2003), p54 His scholarship in Kannada is acclaimed and his compositions are seen as parallels to the vachana poems of the Virashaiva poets and to the devotional songs (pada) of the Haridasas of Karnataka.Pranesh (2003), p54-55 Mysore Sadashiva Rao was born in Greemspet in the Chittoor district of modern Andhra Pradesh to a Maharashtrian family. He came to Mysore between 1825 and 1835 and served as a court musician to the incumbent king for nearly fifty years. His compositions are said to have been in the hundreds, though only about one hundred, written in Sanskrit and Telugu under the pen name \\"Sadashiva\\", still exist.Pranesh (2003), p61, p65 He is known as the reviver of Carnatic music in the Karnataka region.Kamath (2001), p282 Veena Venkatasubbiah came from a Mysorean family of famous veena artists ( or \\"vainika\\") of the time of King Haider Ali and belonged to the Badaganadu community. He was appointed music teacher to King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III by his minister (or \\"Dewan\\") Purniah, who wanted to make Mysore the cultural centre of south India just as Vijayanagara had been during the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire.Pranesh (2003), p77 His most famous composition is the Sapta taleshwari gite. Some historians claim the work was a combined effort by the king and the musician.Pranesh (2003), p75-76 The king's son-in-law, Aliya Lingraj Urs, was an authority and composer in both the Kannada and Sanskrit languages. A native of Heggadadevanakote (in modern Mysore district), he had several interests in the fine arts. He has over fifty works including compositions, dramas, and Yakshagana to his credit, all of which were written with a pen name beginning with \\"Linga\\", such as \\"Lingendra\\" or \\"Lingaraja\\". His most famous compositions in Kannada are titled \\"Chandravali jogi hadu\\", \\"Pancha vimshati leele\\" and \\"Amba kirtana\\", and in Sanskrit, the \\"Shringara lahari\\".Pranesh (2003), p78-79 Shunti Venkataramaniah was a musician from Tiruvayyar (modern Tamil Nadu) and an expert at playing the tambura.Pranesh (2003), p76 He was introduced to the king by the court musician Veena Venkatasubbiah under unusual circumstances. When Venkataramaniah first met Veena Venkatasubbiah, the latter asked him to sing a particular tune. Unable to sing it, Venkataramaniah walked away, only to return a year later having mastered the tune. While singing the tune, Venkataramaniah went into a trance and the court musician hurried to the palace and requested the king to be audience to the singer. The king arrived there and was so pleased with Venkataramaniah's voice he appointed him as a court musician. Venkataramaniah's most famous composition is the Lakshana gite.Pranesh (2003), p76-77 Chinniah was the eldest son of a family known as the \\"Tanjore quartet\\", a quartet of brothers who were singers and composers. Before his arrival in Mysore, Chinniah served at the court of the Tanjore kings Sarabhoji II and Shivaji II. He had learnt music from Muthuswamy Dikshitar. At the court of the king of Mysore, Chinniah created several compositions in praise of his patron king and the local deity Chamundeshwari. Famous among these compositions are Ninnu koriyunna, Vanajalochana, Nivanti, Chakkani na mohanaguni, Manavigai konarada and several javali.Pranesh (2003), p84-86 Veena Chikka Lakshminaranappa, an expert vainika, was a descendant of Krishnappa, a Mysore court musician during the time of Bettada Chamaraja Wodeyar in the 16th century. Chikka Lakshminaranappa became the chief musician in the Prasanna Krishnaswamy temple located within the palace premises. His two sons Krishnappa and Seenappa, who were later patronised by the kings of Mysore, were also proficient players of the veena and violin.Pranesh (2003), p86 Well known visiting musicians to the court during this time included Pallavi Gopalayyar, Veena Kuppayyar, Tiruvattiyur Thyagayyar, Veena Krishnayya and Suryapurada Ananda Dasaru.Pranesh (2003), p88-90 King Chamaraja Wodeyar IX (1868‚Äì1894) King Chamaraja Wodeyar IX was also a patron of the fine arts and literature, having been tutored by his own court musicians Veena Sheshanna and Veena Subbanna.Pranesh (2003), p92 The king was well versed in the violin and often participated, along with other musicians, in violin performances at the Krishna temple located in the palace premises. He is known to have helped many budding artists, both by patronage of their talent and in their personal difficulties. He sponsored Mysore Vasudevacharya (who later became a famous musician) to train at Tiruvayyar under the famous Patnam Subramanya Iyer. He also formed the \\"Amateur Drama Club\\" to encourage young artists. However, he died at the early age of 32 while travelling in Kolkata. Veena Shamanna was the son of Rama Bhagavatar, an immigrant from Tanjore who came to Mysore during a famine, seeking royal patronage. His birth name was Venkata Subramanya.Pranesh (2003), p93 In 1876, Veena Shamanna was appointed court musician for his talent in both vocal and instrumental classical music. He was known as \\"Tala Brahma\\" for his mastery of the veena, violin, ghata and swarabhat.Pranesh (2003), p94 A conservative artist, he played by the norms of theorical classical music and was a tutor to the royal family. In honour of his achievements, a street in Mysore city was named after him. His compositions were published by his son Veena Subramanya Iyer in a book called Sangeeta samayasara in 1915.Pranesh (2003), p96 Veena Padmanabiah, a native of Sriramapura (also known as Budihalu in Chikkanayakanahalli taluk, Karnataka), was trained in classical vocal and veena in his early days by a disciple of Veena Shamanna. Later, under the guidance of Veena Shamanna, Padmanabiah's expertise grew. An incident at the king's palace during his youth made him popular and impressed the king. A well-known musician called Veena Sambayya made a mistake in interpreting a shloka in the musical treatise Sangeeta Ratnakara. Padmanabiah immediately pointed out this error, much to the discomfort of Sambayya, while the rest of the musicians dared not to, out of fear of incurring the senior musician's wrath.Pranesh (2003), p99 Years later, pleased by his talent, the king appointed him to the court and bestowed upon him the title \\"Mahatapi Khillat\\". Padmanabiah also served in the same capacity under the next king, Chamaraja Wodeyar IX. He was a music teacher at the \\"Mysore Maharanis High School\\", at the \\"Maharajas Sanskrit School\\", and he also tutored the royal family.Pranesh (2003), p100 He wrote many compositions in Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada under the pen name \\"Padmanaba\\".Pranesh (2003), p101-108 Veena Sheshanna, considered one of the greatest exponents of the veena in India, was born in Mysore in 1852 to Bakshi Chikkaramappa, a court musician of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III.Pranesh (2003), p108 Once a visiting musician sang a composition (pallavi) and challenged the musicians in the king's court to follow. While none of the senior musicians could sing that composition, Sheshanna, who was still a boy, sang it correctly. Impressed, the king gave the boy a chain of pearls he was wearing and a pair of shawls.Pranesh (2003), p109 It was during the rule of King Chamaraja Wodeyar IX in 1882 that Sheshanna was appointed court musician.Pranesh (2003), p110 His achievements in classical music won Mysore a premier place in the art of playing the veena and he was given the title \\"Vainika Shikhamani\\" by King Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV.Pranesh (2003), p110-111 Veena Sheshanna won laurels and titles from kings and dignitaries including the kings of Travencore, Baroda and Tanjore. He played the veena at the Indian National Congress in Belagavi in 1924 to an audience comprising such leaders as Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and others and received the title \\"Vainika Chakravarthi\\". A photograph of Veena Sheshanna was taken by King George V to be placed in the art gallery at Buckingham Palace.Pranesh (2003), p111-112 Sheshanna was proficient at other instruments, including the violin, swarabhat, rudra veena, jalatarang and even the piano, in which he is known to have composed in English.Pranesh (2003), p113 His compositions are largely in Telugu and Kannada, though he also occasionally composed in Hindi.Pranesh (2003), p114-122 Mysore Karigiri Rao was the son of Lakshmi Narasimhacharya, who hailed from Tumkur and was a Sanskrit Pandit in the court of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III. Karigiri Rao learnt music secretly because his family was against that profession. He later travelled, performing in many places before returning to Mysore at the age of fifty when he was appointed court musician by King Chamaraja Wodeyar IX.Pranesh (2003), p123-124 He was given the title \\"Sangeeta Vidya Kanteerava\\" by senior musicians of the day and \\"Ganakara Durandhara Sangeeta Bhushana\\" by the king himself. He is credited with writing several Carnatic compositions and more than 200 devaranama (devotional songs).Pranesh (2003), p124, p127 Veena Subbanna was born in 1861 in Mysore into a wealthy family of musicians to which he was the only heir. He studied with Prince Chamaraja Wodeyar IX at the Royal school and was well versed in the English language. He was trained in Carnatic vocal music by Mysore Sadashiva Rao and in instrumental music by his father Dodda Sheshanna who was also a famous musician.Pranesh (2003), p128 Veena Subbanna was appointed court musician in 1888 and was a contemporary of the legendary Veena Sheshanna, with whom he was paired in many concerts. A generous man known for his philanthropic deeds, he has many compositions to his credit and earned such titles as \\"Vainika Praveena\\", \\"Vainika Vara Choodamani\\" and \\"Vainika Kesari\\".Pranesh (2003), p135 Mysore Vasudevacharya was a musician and composer born on 28 May 1865 in Mysore. He holds the unique distinction of having been patronised by four generations of Mysore kings and of having been court musician to three.Pranesh (2003), p135 He received royal patronage from the age of five owing to his talent. During his time in Sanskrit school, he learned to play the veena from ace musician Veena Padmanabiah. Later, King Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV sponsored him to learn music at Tiruvayyar under Patnam Subramania Iyer.Pranesh (2003), p138 A master of both Carnatic and Hindustani raga, he delivered the opening Sanskrit shloka (devotional songs) at the Indian National Congress convention at Belagavi in 1924. He represented Mysore in the \\"Akhila Bharateeya Sangeeta Parishat\\" concert held in Gwalior. He earned laurels and titles from kings and dignitaries from all over India, including the \\"Sangeeta Shastra Ratna\\" and \\"Sangeeta Shastra Visharada\\".Pranesh (2003), p140, p147 Numerous compositions in Sanskrit and Telugu are credited to him, as well as one song in Kannada called Karunisou under the pen name \\"Vasudeva\\".Pranesh (2003), p140 Bidaram Krishnappa was a Konkani Brahmin and a native of Nandalike in modern Udupi district, Karnataka. When he was a boy he had a chance encounter with a rich businessman who loved music. This happened when hungry Krishnappa, who came from a poor family, was singing a devotional song (devaranama) in a local temple. Impressed with his voice, the merchant sponsored Krishnappa to train under the guidance of a musician called Ramaswamy. He later came under the influence of Tammayya and Veena Sheshanna.Pranesh (2003), p149 Bidaram Krishnappa is credited with having popularised the singing of Kannada devaranama on stage. He adapted certain concepts of Hindustani music into his Carnatic compositions. For his scholarship in music, he earned the titles \\"Shudda Swaracharya\\", \\"Pallavi Krishnappa\\" and \\"Gana Visharada\\". One of his disciples, T. Chowdiah, went on to become a music legend. Krishnappa was most famous for writing and rendering devaranama and kirtans.Pranesh (2003), p151 Among other well-known composers of the time, Tiruppunandal Pattabhiramiah from Kumbakonam was well known for his javali, with more than fifty to his credit written mostly in Kannada and Telugu under the pen name of \\"Talavana\\".Pranesh (2003), p154-55 Sosale Ayya Shastry was a native of Sosale (in modern Mysore district). His father Garalapuri Shastry was a leading Sanskrit scholar in the court of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, and had later served as teacher to Chamaraja Wodeyar. While not a musician, Garalapuri Shastry had close associations with many musicians, and is believed to have helped Aliya Lingaraje Urs with his composition Sringara Lahari in raga Nilambari. Garalapuri Shastry's ancestors had been ministers in Anegondi province (modern Koppal district, Karnataka). Ayya Shastry, too, served as a Kannada and Sanskrit teacher to the royal family.

King Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV (1884‚Äì1940) King Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV This period, as during the time of the predecessor king, was an important era of music in Mysore, especially for Kannada compositions. The King himself was educated in Kannada, English, Sanskrit, the sciences and was knowledgeable in Tamil and Urdu as well. He was well versed in playing musical instruments including the veena, violin, mridangam, nagaswara, sitar, and harmonium as well as Western instruments such as the saxophone and piano. He encouraged his musicians to compose in the Carnatic, Hindustani and Western styles.Pranesh (2003), p162 During this period, Veena Subramanya Iyer wrote an important treatise on music in Kannada, dealing with both its theoretical and practical aspects, called Sangeeta Samayasara which was published in 1915.Pranesh (2003), p164 A very influential musician, academic and composer of this period was Harikeshanallur Dr. L. Muthiah Bhagavatar.

At the end of the very first concert that Venkatagiriappa gave in the king's presence, the king merely gave him a gift of two Indian rupees and left the concert. The musician and his family were disappointed at the king's response. Later the king learnt from one of his attendants that the musician and his family had taken the gift graciously. The king, who had been testing the musician's attitude to music, was pleased and appointed Venkatagiriappa court musician.Pranesh (2003), p191 Over the years, the king gave Venkatagiriappa more responsibility in the functioning of various schools of fine arts in his kingdom. Venkatagiriappa played the veena for fifteen minutes in a well-known documentary movie called \\"Musical Instruments of India\\" in 1935. He was given the title \\"Vainika Praveena\\".

For his contributions, he was awarded an honorary doctorate and was made a fellow of \\"Sangeet Natak Academy\\" (an academy of music and drama). Many important musicians were part of the king's court. Tiger Varadachariar, a native of Kaladipet (modern Tamil Nadu) moved initially to T. Narasipura where he performed music for some years. Later he moved back to Chennai where he served in various music schools. In 1916, he got an opportunity to sing in the presence of King Krishnadavaraja IV.

It is maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The road runs from the end of Fellsway East in Stoneham, eastward through Melrose, and ends in Saugus at US Route 1. The parkway serves as a connector between the Middlesex Fells Reservation and Breakheart Reservation. History The parkway was proposed in 1897 as part of a wide-ranging series of interconnected parkways in the greater Boston area. The original proposal by the Olmsted Brothers landscape design firm was that the parkway would connect the Middlesex Fells to the Lynn Woods Reservation in Lynn, but the full proposal was never implemented. The first portion of the parkway, from the Stoneham-Melrose line to Main Street in Melrose, was built between 1906 and 1908, although a particularly difficult section, built on swampy land near Ell Pond Park, was not completed until 1911. Lack of funding stalled construction of additional sections until 1929, when construction to Route 1 was begun. Plans to continue the parkway to Lynn Woods only advanced as far as acquiring and grading a right of way from Route 1 to Walnut Street, part of which is now taken over by the figure-eight interchange between the two roads. The Melrose/Saugus portion of the parkway was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 9, 2003, listed along with other roadways of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston. Contributing elements to the National Register listing, in addition to the roadway, are the tree canopy that shades much of the road, and the 1930 girder bridge that carries railroad tracks over the road between Vinton and Tremont Streets in Melrose.

Phalangium opilio is known to feed on Helicoverpa zea eggs, and thus can act as biological pest control for soybean crops. The species is nocturnal, as is typical of opilionids.

Jean Boucher (November 20, 1870, Cesson- S√©vign√©, Ille-et-Vilaine ‚Äì June 17, 1939, Paris) was a French sculptor based in Brittany. He is best known for his public memorial sculptures which communicated his liberal politics and patriotic dedication to France and Brittany. Biography Early years Early sculptures on Biblical topics, Dol Cathedral. Boucher was born in Cesson-S√©vign√© near Rennes, Brittany. After his early schooling Boucher learned the trade of a blacksmith, but very soon he was attracted by the arts of drawing and sculpture. Pierre Lenoir, professor at the regional school of Rennes, taught the rudiments of fine art to him, and soon realised his young pupil's aptitude. In the 1890s he worked on restorations for the cathedral of Saint Samson in Dol-de-Bretagne, which he later described as his true school. He obtained a government grant to continue his studies in Paris where he met his mentors Alexandre Falgui√®re at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and Henri-Michel-Antoine ChapuBenezit Dictionary of Artists of the Acad√©mie Julian. Both gave him a respect for truth in sculpture, a product of the wider trend of Realism associated with Jules Dalou and Auguste Rodin. Liberal ideals Ernest Renan, Tr√©guier. In 1898 Boucher joined the Bleus de Bretagne, an organisation founded to promote liberal values in Brittany. Boucher was described by Armand Dayot as a \\"Breton, Dreyfusard and freethinker\\". In this capacity he was commissioned to create a sculpture commemorating the skeptical thinker Ernest Renan in Renan's home town of Tr√©guier. The sculpture, depicting Renan with the goddess Athena, was immensely controversial, being interpreted as a challenge to Catholicism, especially as it was placed beside the cathedral. Major protests accompanied its installation. Boucher's association with liberal and anti-clerical values led to a commission to depict the liberal hero Victor Hugo in exile on Guernsey, not far from the Breton coast. Hugo is depicted looking out from the island back to France, brooding over his exile, and standing on a rocky outcrop. In 1907 Boucher created a multi-figure memorial to prominent Dreyfus supporter and human rights activist Ludovic Trarieux in Place Denfert- Rochereau, Paris. Another large marble in Paris is at the Place Saint- Ferdinand. It depicts L√©on Serpollet in his land speed record winning steam car, surrounded by children enveloped by the steam. Boucher was also commissioned to create a sculpture allegorically representing the union of Brittany with France. This too created controversy, particularly among Breton nationalists, who resented the union and the erosion of Brittany's distinct culture. They complained that the portrayal of Anne of Brittany was demeaning, as she was shown kneeling to the French king. The Breton Nationalist Party was founded to protest its creation, and in 1932 the sculpture was bombed by Gwenn ha du, a Breton separatist terrorist group led by C√©lestin Lain√©. The date was designed to coincide with anniversary of Breton union with France in 1532.Monument to the Union of Brittany and France Fragments of the broken work have been preserved. Boucher also created uncontroversial memorial sculptures to distinguished cultural figures, such as Yves Guyot, Charles Le Goffic and the poet Andr√© Rivoire. War memorials Boucher did his duty as a soldier during World War I. Called to bear arms with the rank of sergeant, he ended the war as a lieutenant, winner of the Croix de guerre, and suffering the effects of gassing. Appointed Professor at the l'√©cole des beaux-Arts, he continued to work on his art, devoting much of his time to creating memorials to the soldiers who died for France. He is the creator of the monuments dedicated to the \\"Saint-Cyriens\\", to the marshal Joseph Gallieni of Verdun, to the American volunteers (in the Place des √âtats-Unis, Paris), to the aviator √àdouard Mounier and others. As a veteran of the Battle of Verdun, he was also commissioned to create the principal sculpture placed on the memorial to the battle in Verdun itself. He also created the war memorial for the town of H√©d√©, in which he lived for most of his life after the war. Later career He was elected an official of the Academy des Beaux-Arts on February 29, 1936, to replace Hippolyte Lef√®bvre. In his last years Boucher was working on new designs for a replacement for the bombed monument to Breton unity with France. He completed maquettes of more than one proposed design. One of the objections of Breton nationalists to the earlier statue had been that it portrayed the duchess Anne of Brittany kneeling submissively before the King of France, so the new designs carefully stressed the equality of the figures. However, the replacement project was abandoned after Boucher's death and the outbreak of war in 1939. Another of his late projects also remained unfinished, his memorial to Camille Desmoulins and the storming of the Bastille. After his death the stone sculpture was sawn into several pieces for storage. Intended for display in Paris, it was eventually reconstructed and displayed in Boucher's home town of Cesson-S√©vign√©. Boucher was a highly respected teacher. Among his pupils were the sculptors Paul Belmondo (father of Jean-Paul Belmondo), Jules-Charles Le Bozec and Francis Renaud. After Boucher's death his son Jean-Marie Boucher created an association dedicated to preserve interest in his father's work. Following his own death in 2000 a new Association des Amis de Jean Boucher (Friends of Jean Boucher) was formed in Rennes. Its honorary presidents are Jean-Paul Belmondo and Edmond Herv√©.Association des Amis de Jean Boucher Major works Victor Hugo in exile, Candie, Saint Peter Port, Guernsey Monument to Ernest Renan in Tr√©guier (1902).

Sculpture parks There are two sculpture parks devoted to Boucher's works, one of which is in his birthplace in Cesson-S√©vign√© and one in his adopted home of H√©d√©. The former contains some figures from the destroyed monument to Breton- French unity, along with studies of human heads. The latter contains studies for the Verdun monument and monument to American volunteers. It also contains study heads. His figure La Bretonne, a woman portrayed in local Breton costume, is in the town square.

Olfert was president of the Manitoba Government and General Employees‚Äô Union (formerly the Manitoba Government Employees' Association) from 1986 to 2010. He has also served as a vice-president of the National Union of Public and General Employees. Olfert was raised in a Mennonite family in Steinbach, and later moved to Winnipeg. He completed his Grade 12, was a maintenance worker and embalmer in the 1970s, and served as a postal clerk in the Department of Government Services before being chosen as MGEU president. He attended Labour College in Ottawa in 1985.Glen MacKenzie, \\"President Olfert MGEU head has seen many changes in decade\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 October 1996, B4. Olfert has represented his union in negotiations with three different provincial governments. He was often critical of the austerity measures pursued by Premier Gary Filmon's administration in the 1990s,See for instance David Roberts, \\"Manitoba slashes 1,000 jobs, Budget pleases business leaders\\", Globe and Mail, 17 April 1991, A6; \\"Manitoba public servants protest budget cutbacks\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 8 April 1993, F14; \\"MGEU putting rollback case before UN body\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 May 1993. and at one stage accused Filmon of intimidating the union into silence.Frances Russell, \\"Filmon's sieve rarely leaks\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 October 1994. He later said that an advocacy campaign by his union succeeded in making health care and education the main issues of the 1995 provincial election. See Lindor Reynolds, \\"Advocacy groups claim victory but electorate shrugs them off\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 April 1995. He was also a frequent opponent of Labour Minister Vic Toews, and led home-care workers and casino workers in protracted battles against the government in 1996.Paul McKie, \\"Deprived of its sword, injured MGEU fights on\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 April 1996, B13; \\"Care workers set to strike\\", Globe and Mail, 10 June 1996, N6; Alice Krueger, \\"End is in sight for strikers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 August 1996, A1; \\"Casino workers seek fair play\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 September 1996, A11; Paul Samyn, \\"Olfert expects to be re-elected MGEU leader\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 September 1996, A4. In 1997, Olfert endorsed a provincial deal to end the Filmon government's policy of wage freezes and unpaid days off.Kim Guttormson, \\"Filmon Fridays end with new deal\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 November 1997, A3. In the same period, he worked in a successful battle to extend employee benefits to same-sex couples.\\"Feds to extend same-sex benefits\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 March 1999, A12. Filmon's government was defeated by the New Democratic Party under Gary Doer in the 1999 provincial election (Doer, ironically, was Olfert's predecessor as MGEU president). Olfert's union accepted a deal to allow for optional unpaid leave days in 2002,David Kuxhaus, \\"Union gives 'Doer Days' its blessing\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 August 2002, A3. though he has nonetheless engaged in several difficult negotiations with the Doer government.See for example \\"Union head slams government\\", Montreal Gazette, 17 March 2006, A10. Olfert became acting chairman of the Crocus Investment Fund in late 2004, at a time when the fund announced that it was freezing sales and reviewing the value of its assets.\\"Bloom is off Crocus fund\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 13 December 2004, A12. He submitted his resignation in May 2005, after the fund experienced further difficulties.Paul Egan, \\"Seventh Crocus director offers to quit troubled fund\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 2005, B3. Shortly thereafter, he said that he was shocked by reports of lavish overspending by officers, and added that he had not always been given accurate information about the fund.Paul Egan, \\"'How could this happen?'

In some cases ‚Äì particularly in England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland ‚Äì the surname is derived from the Middle English yunge, yonge (\\"young\\"); this particular surname usually originated to distinguish a younger son. In other cases, the surname is an anglicisation of any number of like-sounding, or cognate surnames in other languages. For example: the German Jung and Junk; the Dutch Jong; in Sweden, Ljung; and the French Lejeune and Lajeunesse. The surname can also be a form of the French Dion or Guyon. In yet other cases, it is a romanization of Chinese Yang (/).Young at Yutopian Names Very rarely, it may be a romanization of the Korean surnames Yong () or Yeong (); however, if seen in a Korean name, it is far more likely that Young is a portion of the given name instead.The latter surname is uncommon; according to the 2000 South Korean census, only 259 South Korean citizens had this surname. The former surname is more common, at 14,067 citizens, but when they romanize it, for example in their South Korean passports, nearly all of them (97%, in one sample from 2007) spell it Yong rather than Young. In contrast, given names beginning with Yeong/Young were some of South Korea's most popular names for baby boys in the 1940s through 1960s. There have been five baronetcies created for persons with the surname Young, one in the Baronetage of England, one in the Baronetage of Great Britain and three in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. As of 2014 four of the creations are extant. They are Young Baronetcy.

He played college for the Miami Hurricanes and professionally in NFL Europe, XFL, United Indoor Football and the Indoor Football League. High school career Clement attended Mullen High School in Denver, Colorado, lettering in football, basketball, and baseball. He was the Mustangs' starting quarterback from the first game of his freshman year through his senior season and was a Colorado All-State football selection four years in a row. Clement was selected to receive the Denver Post Gold Helmet Award presented to the state's top football athlete/scholar/citizen for the 1993/1994 school year. He was also selected as a Parade magazine All-American his senior year. College career After graduating in 1994, Clement went on to attend the University of Miami, a college football powerhouse who had been hurt by NCAA sanctions. With the Hurricanes, Clement would split the starting quarterback role in 1995 with Ryan Collins. Clement replaced Collins in the third game of the 1995 season against Virginia Tech when Collins was sidelined with an injury. Clement started the remaining 8 games, losing his first start to Florida State but finishing the season with 7 wins in a row. After a slow start in 1995, going 1-3 before finishing the season at 8-3, Miami would still have participated in a post-season bowl because of its strong finish. Miami, however, was ineligible for bowl game participation due to NCAA sanctions. This was Butch Davis's first year as Head Coach of the Hurricanes. Clement took over the starting role full-time in 1996, leading the Big East in pass efficiency with a 147.1 rating. Clement was a leading candidate for the Davey O‚ÄôBrien National Quarterback Award in 1996 and was also an All-Big East Conference selection. He led the Hurricanes to the Big East title shared with Virginia Tech and Syracuse (all finished 6-1 in conference play) with an impressive performance in the final game of the season at Syracuse. Clement threw for three touchdowns to help Miami defeat the Donovan McNabb led Orangemen 38-31, earning Big East ‚ÄúPlayer of the Week‚Äù honors and giving Miami a share of the Big East conference crown. Miami finished the 1996 season 9-3, with a win over Virginia in the Carquest Bowl and ranked 14th in both the AP and coaches polls. 1997 proved to be an extremely difficult year for Clement and the Hurricanes. Miami, beset by the scholarship reductions due to NCAA violations under the Dennis Erickson tenure, and forced to play several true freshmen as starters in key positions, fell to a 5-6 record, their first losing record since 1979. Clement led the Miami Hurricanes in 30 regular season games as the starting quarterback over three seasons, and led his team to a win in the 1996 Carquest Bowl in the only post-season game he started. He received the Walter Kichefski Football Award, selected by his coaches as the Miami player that most represents the characteristics Kichefski lived by: respect for fellow man, loyalty, dedication, sacrifice, motivation and inspiration. Clement finished his career at Miami among the all-time statistical leaders in the following categories: * Career Pass Completion Percentage:(Minimum 250 Attempts) - (443 of 747) - 59.3% (4th All-Time), * Career Pass Completions: 443 (4th All-Time), * Career Pass Attempts: 747 (4th All-Time), * Career Passing Yardage: 6,004 (5th All-Time), * Career Total Offense: 5,659 (5th All- Time), * Career Touchdown Passes: 43 (6th All-Time). He also owns two individual season marks for Pass Completion Percentage for the 1996 season of 60.3% (164 of 272) (6th All-Time) and for the 1995 season of 59.2% (199 of 201) (10th All-Time)2007 University of Miami Football Press Guide Professional Clement would never play in the NFL, but in 1999 signed with the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe. He would return to America in 2001, to play for the Las Vegas Outlaws of the newly created XFL. He started for Las Vegas in the XFL's first game, a nationally televised contest on NBC, where he threw for 188 yards and two touchdowns in the Outlaws' victory. Clement sustained a serious injury late in the first quarter of game two against the Memphis Maniax when defensive end Shante Carver was penalized for a late hit that caused a third degree separation of Clement's right (throwing) shoulder. Clement did not play the next three games due to this injury but returned to start game six against the Orlando Rage in Orlando. He was the starter in each of the Outlaw's remaining games but was again knocked out late in the fourth quarter of game nine (against the San Francisco Demons) when linebacker Jon Haskins hit Clement after the play was over and was ejected from the game. The XFL would fold after its only championship game that spring. Ryan Clement completed his XFL quarterback career with the Las Vegas Outlaws with 805 passing yards, 78 completions in 136 attempts for a pass completion percentage of 57.4%. He threw for 9 touchdowns against 4 interceptions in the six games that he played.Las Vegas Outlaws Roster-Ryan Clement Since the XFL, Clement returned to Denver. A political science major at Miami who also earned a law degree, he now works as counsel for a Denver lobbying firm. He has talked of a comeback to football though, in the newly formed All American Football League. In the Spring of 2008, Ryan Clement became the starting quarterback for the Colorado Ice in the Western Conference of the United Indoor Football league.

The diocese has the same boundaries as the department of the Vosges. The bishop has his throne at Saint-Di√© Cathedral in the town now named Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges, but since 1944 has lived in √âpinal, capital of the d√©partement. The diocese is currently a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Besan√ßon. The current bishop is Jean-Paul Marie Mathieu, who was appointed in December 2005. History The Diocese of Saint-Di√© originated in the celebrated abbey of that name. Saint Deodatus (Di√©) (b. towards the close of the sixth century; died 679) came, according his legendary written in 1050 by benedictin monks of Moyenmoutier, from Nevers and the Nivernais. According to some historians, we do not known where Deodatus comes from : a hypothesis proposed from Ireland which explained the Latin reading confusion between Niverniensis and hiberniensis, others searchers think he could be a Christian who has travelled a lot, and may be lived in the North of Britain's Islands. He may be educated too in Austrasia by Scottish monks attracted by the reputation of Saint Columbanus. Some sceptical scientists add this legend would definitely distinguish D√©odat as a holy itinerant who was not a benedictin monk : he comes from nowhere. Maybe he was just a Christian chief. Only one fact is sure : D√©odat is the founder and first patron of a Merovingian district with political and religious power, a ban decided by the king of Austrasia Childeric II.This territory takes a lot of montanous land from his fiscus, or royal reserve named foresta, but integers private domains and little villages too And, after his dead, he was considered and consacred by local populations as a holy man. As, for orthodoxic thinkers of these times, only monk could be perfect, D√©odat was becoming gradually a monk. Legendary versions show this holy man, in old French Bonhomme on little mountainous paths between Rambervillers and Colmar. They tell us he made the acquaintance of Saints Arbogast and Florentius and walked with through the passes. From Alsace, sometimes from the Heilige Wald, German term for Hollywood, near Haguenau, he withdrew to the Vosges, sojourning at Romont where he began a lot of miracles, and Arentelle, where the inhabitants were hostile. For some time he was a solitary at Wilra or Wibra, maybee near the present Katzenthal in Alsace, but being persecuted by the inhabitants, he walked with a big stick who planted in soil created always a spring of water. Above the pass of Bonhomme, on the top of Rossberg, he launched an ironed arm until a locus called Petit-Saint-Di√© under the Kemberg, a mountain, precisely under rocks Saint-Martin. Springs of flowed on this left side of the Meurthe, and he founded a refuge under rocks and near above springs. Once he received this lands in 669 he decided to work. His first monastery hardly built with new brothership, he was tied and dreamed to build a monastery in a little hill \\"Juncturae\\" in the right side of the river, the future Galil√©e. Longtime a prairie, then a little town, and now the center of Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges stand between this two places. Before this time, Leudin Bodo, Bishop of Toul, had founded to the north-west of Saint-Di√© the monastery of Bonmoutier for his daughter and to the south of Bonmoutier that of Etival; Saint Gondelbert, perhaps after resigning the Archbishopric of Sens, had just founded Senones Abbey to the east. These four monasteries formed, by their geographical position the four extremities of a cross. Later, Saint Hidulphus, Bishop of Trier (d 707), erected between them at the intersection of the two arms of the cross, the monastery of Moyenmoutier. Villigod and Martin (disciples of Saint Di√©), Abbot Spinulus (Spin), John the priest, and the deacon Benignus (disciples of Saint Hidulphus) are honoured as saints. In the 10th century the Abbey of Saint-Di√© grew lax, and Frederick I, Duke of Lorraine, expelled the Benedictines, replacing them by the Canons Regular of St. Augustine. Pope Gregory V, in 996, agreed to the change and decided that the grand pr√©v√¥t, the principal dignitary of the abbey, should depend directly upon the Holy See. During the sixteenth century, profiting by the long vacancy of the see of Toul, the abbots of the several monasteries in the Vosges, without actually declaring themselves independent of the diocese of Toul, claimed to exercise a quasi-episcopal jurisdiction as to the origin of which, however, they were not agreed; in the eighteenth century they pretended to be nullius dioceseos. In 1718, Thiard de Bissy, Bishop of Toul, requested the election of a see at Saint-Di√©. Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, was in favour of this step, but the King of France opposed it; the Holy See refrained for the time from action. This diocese was erected in 1777 after the French annexation of the duchy of Lorraine. The territory consists of numerous monastic Vosgian territories and other lands, belonging to the venerable Diocese of Toul: the new Diocese of Saint-Di√© was until the end of the Ancien R√©gime, was a suffragan of Trier. The diocese was transformed by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790 and officially called of Vosges and especially of Epinal: it had indeed been established in the new departemantal area. Nevertheless, it was sometimes referred to at that period as the diocese of Saint-Di√©, because the bishop Monsieur de Chaumont decided to stay and keep his episcopal seat. During the Revolutionary period it was suppressed, after an overnight flight by the bishop. The Holy See and the French Republic, represented by Napol√©on Bonaparte, validated this state of fact as many others in the peaceful Concordat of 1801. It was decided to give this territory to the diocese of Nancy. The King Louis XVIII and Roman Catholic ecclesiastics later restored it in name by the Concordat of 1817, but local Christians waited much later, after a Papal bull of 6 October 1822, and a royal ordinance of 13 January 1823, as a suffragan of Besan√ßon. According to a principle sanctioned by this last Concordat, the diocesan boundaries were realigned, however, to follow those of the civil department of the Vosges. The Franco-German War closed by the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871) removed eighteen communes in the valley of the River Bruche from the department of the Vosges and the diocese of Saint-Di√©, adding them respectively to Nieder-Elsass (Bas-Rhin) and the Diocese of Strasbourg. Louis Caverot, who died as Cardinal Archbishop of Lyon, was Bishop of Saint-Di√© from 1849 to 1876. Other religious houses in the diocese Saints and religious of the diocese Besides the saints mentioned above and some others, bishops of Nancy and Toul, the, following are honoured in a special manner in the Diocese of Saint-Di√©: * Saint Sigebert, Merovingian King of Austrasia (630‚Äì56) * Saint Germain, a hermit near Remiremont, a martyr, who died Abbot of Grandval, near Basle (618‚Äì70) * Saint Hunna, a penitent at Saint-Di√© (d. about 672) * Saint Dagobert, another King of Austrasia, slain by his servant Grimoald in 679 and honoured as a martyr * Saint Modesta, a nun at Remiremont, afterwards foundress and abbess of the monastery of Horren at Trier (seventh century) * Saint Simeon, Bishop of Metz (eighth century), whose relics are preserved at Senones * Saint Go√©ry, Bishop of Metz (d. about 642), whose relics are preserved at Epinal and who is the patron of the butchers of the town * Saint William and Saint Achery, hermits near Ste. Marie aux Mines * Richardis (wife of Charles the Fat), who died as Abbess of Andlau in Alsace * Blessed Joan of Arc, b. at Domr√©my in the diocese * Saint Pierre Fourier (b. at M√©ricourt, 1565; d. 1640), cur√© of Mattaincourt, who founded the Order of Notre-Dame * Venerable M√©re Alix le Clerc (b. at Remiremont, 1576; d. 1622) Elizabeth de Ranfaing (born at Remiremont, 1592; died 1649) founded in the Diocese of Toul the congregation of Our Lady of Refuge; Catherine de Bar (b. at Saint-Di√©, 1614; d. 1698), known as M√©re Mechtilde of the Blessed Sacrament, at first an Annunciade nun and then a Benedictine, founded at Paris, in 1654, the Order of the Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Elizabeth Brem (1609‚Äì68, known as Mother Benedict of the Passion), a Benedictine nun at Rambervillers, established in that monastery the Institute of the Perpetual Adoration. The remains of Brother Joseph Formet (1724‚Äì84, known as the hermit of Ventron), are the object of a pilgrimage. Venerable Jean Martin Moye (1730‚Äì93), founder in Lorraine of the Congr√©gation de la Providence for the instruction of young girls and apostle of Su-Tchuen, was director for a brief period of the seminary of Saint-Di√©, and established at Essegney, in the diocese, one of the first novitiates of the Soeurs de la Providence (hospitallers and teachers), whose mother-house at Portieux ruled over a large number of houses before the Law of 1901. Grandclaude, a village teacher who was sent to the Roman College in 1857 by Bishop Caverot, contributed, when a professor in the grand seminaire of Saint- Di√©, to the revival of canon law studies in France.

Molecular aspects of control and prevention are also covered, as well as viral vectors and gene therapy, but clinical virology is excluded. As of 2013, the journal is published fortnightly by Elsevier.

It was originally published by Academic Press, and then under the Academic Press imprints of purchasers Harcourt, Brace & World and Elsevier.Wagner RR. (1999) The Journal of Virology: a Personal Retrospective. J Virol 73: 3515‚Äì3519 (text)National Library of Medicine: NLM catalogue: Virology (accessed 18 February 2013) The journal was soon successful. Robert Wagner, founding editor of the Journal of Virology, describes Virology in the mid-1960s as \\"the well-established Academic Press journal Virology, which had an excellent reputation and to which many virus researchers, including myself, submitted their very best papers.\\" Seven issues in two volumes were published in the initial year, with a total of 538 pages. In 1959, the frequency increased to monthly, with three annual volumes, and the journal had nearly quadrupled in size by its sixth year. The frequency increased to 14 issues per year in 1976, returning to monthly in 1987, and then increasing again over 1994‚Äì95 to reach twice monthly in 1996.Science Direct: Virology Contents (accessed 18 February 2013) The first issue contained a broad mix of research including papers on bacteriophages, the plant viruses, tobacco mosaic and potato virus X, and the animal viruses, influenza, Rift Valley fever and poliovirus. Authors included Renato Dulbecco, Alfred Hershey, Raymond Latarjet, Andr√© Michel Lwoff and Marguerite Vogt, among others. The journal had an international authorship from the start, with authors from the United States and France, two major centres of phage research at that date, as well as Japan. The early content was biased towards virus structure and replication, which made up two-thirds of the content in the mid-1960s, but have gradually been replaced by research into pathogenesis, immunity and interactions with the host cell, which made up more than two- thirds of the journal in 1999. The early journal was particularly known for publishing research into plant viruses. Wagner writes \\"our competitor, Virology, had emphasized plant viruses to such a degree that this area had become a paramount part of their publishing effort and most plant virologists looked upon Virology as their journal.\\" This focus changed over time, and by 1999, animal viruses were the subject of over 88% of the journal's content. Salvador Luria, one of Virologys founders Hirst served as editor-in-chief for 21 years until 1975, and his influence on the journal was enormous. When he retired, his co-editors wrote that \\"he has defined the journal's objectives and established its style.\\" Hirst has had only three successors: Wolfgang Joklik served for 18 years (1975‚Äì1994) and was succeeded by Robert A. Lamb (1994‚Äì2012).Northwestern University: Lamb Laboratory: Curriculum Vitae: Robert Andrew Lamb (accessed 17 February 2013) The present editor-in-chief, Michael Emerman (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, USA), took over in January 2013.Elsevier: Virology Editorial Board (accessed 17 February 2013) Of Hirst's co-founders, Luria, the well-known phage researcher, remained a co- editor for 18 years; Black was the plant virus editor until 1965. Another well-known co-editor was Arnold J. Levine (1975‚Äì1984), who left Virology to become editor-in-chief of the Journal of Virology. Modern journal Papers are accepted on all viruses, irrespective of host species, but the modern journal's primary focus is on animal viruses.

As part of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive on the Western Front in the late summer of 1918, the Australian Corps crossed the Somme River on the night of August 31, and broke the German lines at Mont Saint-Quentin and P√©ronne. The British Fourth Army's commander, General Henry Rawlinson, described the Australian advances of August 31 ‚Äì September 4 as the greatest military achievement of the war. During the battle Australian troops stormed, seized and held the key height of Mont Saint-Quentin (overlooking P√©ronne), a pivotal German defensive position on the line of the Somme. Background The Allies were pursuing the Germans, and the greatest obstacle to crossing the Somme River in pursuit was Mont Saint-Quentin which, situated in a bend of the river, dominated the whole position. The Mont was only 100 metres high but was a key to the German defence of the Somme line, and the last German stronghold. It overlooked the Somme River approximately 1.5 kilometres north of P√©ronne. Its location made it an ideal observation post, and strategically, the hill's defences guarded the north and western approaches to the town. Australian forces faced the German LI Corps, part of 2nd Army, under General Max von Boehn. According to Australian official historian Charles Bean, \\"German archives show that the 51st Corps anticipated the offensive... The line divisions were ordered to increase their depth and the counter-attack divisions to 'stand to.C. E. W. Bean, 1942, Official History of Australia in the War of 1914‚Äì1918 - Volume VI ‚Äì The Australian Imperial Force in France during the Allied Offensive, 1918, Sydney, Angus and Robertson, pp916-7. Bean states that LI Corps controlled the 5th Royal Bavarian Division, 1st Reserve Division and 119th Division. The German 94th Infantry Regiment (part of the IV Reserve Corps) was also involved in the battle. Battle Capture of Mont Saint Quentin painting by Fred Leist (1920) The offensive was planned by General John Monash; Monash planned a high-risk frontal assault which required the Australian 2nd Division to cross a series of marshes to attack the heights. This plan failed when the assaulting troops could not cross the marshes. After this initial setback, Monash man≈ìuvred his divisions in the only free man≈ìuvre battle of any consequence undertaken by the Australians on the Western Front.Fidge, AC. 2003. Sir John Monash ‚Äì An effective and competent commander?. Australian Defence College, Geddes Papers \\"The gaps in the wire near Anvil Wood were death traps\\", reads the caption of a contemporary photograph of the battlefield. Australians of the 2nd Division crossed to the north bank of the Somme River on the evening of 30 August. At 5 am on 31 August, supported by artillery, two significantly undermanned Australian battalions charged up Mont St Quentin, ordered by Monash to \\"scream like bushrangers\\". The Germans quickly surrendered and the Australians continued to the main German trench-line. In the rear, other Australians crossed the Somme by a bridge which Australian engineers had saved and repaired. The Australians were unable to hold their gains on Mont St Quentin and German reserves regained the crest. However, the Australians held on just below the summit and next day it was recaptured and firmly held. On that day also, 1 September, Australian forces broke into P√©ronne and took most of the town. The next day it completely fell into Australian hands. In three days the Australians endured 3,000 casualties but ensured a general German withdrawal eastwards back to the Hindenburg Line. Aftermath Looking back after the event, Monash accounted for the success by the wonderful gallantry of the men, the rapidity with which the plan was carried out, and the sheer daring of the attempt. In his Australian Victories in France, Monash pays tribute to the commander of the 2nd Division, Major-General Charles Rosenthal, who was in charge of the operation. But Monash and his staff were responsible for the conception of the project and the working out of the plans.Serle, Percival (1949). \\"Monash, John\\". Dictionary of Australian Biography. Sydney: Angus and Robertson. The Allied victory at the Battle of Mont Saint Quentin dealt a strong blow to five German divisions, including the elite 2nd Guards Division. As the position overlooked much of the terrain east of Mont St. Quentin, it guaranteed that the Germans would not be able to stop the allies west of the Hindenburg Line (the same position from which the Germans had launched their offensive in the spring). A total of 2,600 prisoners were taken at a cost of slightly over 3,000 casualties. The following soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross for their role in the battle, all to members of the Australian 2nd Division: *Albert David Lowerson, 21st Battalion, originally from Myrtleford, Victoria *Robert MacTier, 23rd Battalion, originally from Tatura, Victoria *Edgar Thomas Towner, 2nd Machine Gun Battalion, from Blackall, Queensland * Lawrence Carthage Weathers, 43rd Battalion (Australia), 3rd Division, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his role in the battle.C. E. W. Bean. The Australian Imperial Force in France during the Allied Offensive, 1918, (1st edition, 1942), Volume VI, Chapter XVIII, p.862. Other medals awarded included the Military Medal. Robert James Young, 25th Battalion, originally from Brisbane, was one such awardee. During the attack, according to Rosenthal, the recommending general, \\"he selected a position on a hill which was being heavily shelled at the time. He remained there for half an hour trying to establish visual communication. When this failed, he at once ran at a line to bde Forward Station through very heavy machine gun and artillery fire and remained out on the line the whole day, keeping it in order. Throughout the whole operation he showed an utter disregard of danger and set a fine example to all his men.\\" William Stevens, 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion, originally from Melbourne was awarded a Bar to his Military Medal for his work during the battle. In part, his citation from Rosenthal reads: \\"In the Village fighting he personal lead a party of five which accounted for 16 of the enemy who put up a spirited resistance. Later during the consolidation, he personally supervised the placing of the six Company Lewis Guns, moving around the Company front in spite of fierce enemy fire. His work throughout was of the highest order, and his fighting spirit throughout was of the greatest value to the success of his Company.\\" See also * Mont Saint-Quentin Australian war memorial References External links  Category:Battles of the Western Front (World War I) Category:Battles of World War I involving Australia Category:Battles of World War I involving Germany Mont St Quentin Category:1918 in France Category:Conflicts in 1918 Category:August 1918 events Category:September 1918 events Category:Australia‚ÄìGermany military relations ","title":"Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin"},{"id":"13026746","text":"Vinay Bhat (born June 4, 1984) is an American chess Grandmaster.

Bhat spent his early years studying the games of Paul Morphy and Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca as a part of the Blue Knights.East Bay Chess Club - About Vinay \\"That was my steady diet,\\" Bhat said.Personal interview, conducted Aug. 31, 2007 Bhat studied chess with GM Gregory Kaidanov.CALCHESS.org - The Northern California Chess Association At 10 years and 176 days old, Bhat became the youngest national master, breaking the record previously held by Jordy Mont-Reynaud (10 years and 294 days),\\"Jordy Mont-Reynaud's record of becoming a master at the youngest age (ten years, 209 days) has been broken by Vinay Bhat (ten years, 176 days) of San Jose, California.\\" Chess Life, July 1995, p. 8. Stuart Rachels (11 years and 10 months),Stuart Rachels. jamesrachels.org. Retrieved on 2009-06-26. and before that by Bobby Fischer (age 13). Since then, his record has been broken three times, by California players Hikaru Nakamura, Nicholas Nip, and Samuel Sevian. In 1998, Bhat contributed to \\"Whiz Kids Teach Chess\\" () with Eric Schiller. At the age of 15 years and 10 months, Bhat became an International Master, at the time the youngest ever in U.S. history; this record was later surpassed by Hikaru Nakamura and is presently held by Ray Robson.East Bay Chess Club - About Vinay Notable junior tournament results and awards * 1992 California Primary School (K-3) State Champion (Tied with Jordy Mont- Reynaud)Calchess.org * Tied for second at the Under-12 World Youth Championships in 1995 (won by Etienne Bacrot)http://www.365chess.com/tournaments/Wch_U12_1995 * Winner of the 1996 Laura Aspis Prize for the top-ranked American chess player under the age of 13 * Tied for second at the Under-12 World Youth Rapid Chess Championships in 1996 (won by Kamil Mito≈Ñ) * Bronze medal winner at the Under-12 World Youth Championships in 1996 (won by Kamil Mito≈Ñ) * Tied for third at the Under-14 World Youth Championships in 1998 (won by Bu Xiangzhi) * Tied for first at US Cadet (Under-16) Championships in 1998 (with Dmitri Schneider) * Gold medal (clear first place) at the Under-14 Pan-American Championships in Brazil in 1998 * Four-time California High School (K-12) State Champion * Three-time winner of the Neil Falconer Award for top-ranked CA junior chessplayer from 2000 to 2002 * Tied for first in the High School Division of the CEA Nationals (with Harutyan Akopyan) in 2000  Later chess career  After taking an extended break from chess, Bhat began to play regularly again in 2008.

Klein Ct. of App. of N.Y., 56 N.Y.2d 98, 436 N.E.2d 502 (1982) is a 1982 decision by the New York Court of Appeals dealing with the use of custom in determining whether a person acted reasonably given the situation. It is commonly studied in introductory U.S. tort law classes. Facts Trimarco (P) appealed an order which reversed a judgment in favor of P and dismissed P's complaint in a negligence action for personal injuries. P was severely injured when he fell through the glass door enclosing his tub in his apartment he was renting. It was not possible for P or his wife to determine if the glass was tempered or just ordinary glass. After the accident, the glass was found to be just ordinary glass. P sued Klein (D), his landlord, for the injuries. At trial, P introduced expert evidence about the custom and usage of tempered glass from 1956 to 1976. Since at least the early 1950s, a practice of using shatterproof glazing materials for bathroom enclosures had come into common use, so that by 1976 the glass door here no longer conformed to accepted safety standards. P also showed that over this period bulletins of nationally recognized safety and consumer organizations along with official Federal publications had joined in warning of the dangers that lurked when plain glass was utilized in \\"hazardous locations\\", including \\"bathtub enclosures\\". Over objection, the trial court also allowed in sections of New York's General Business Law, which, as of July 1, 1973, required, on pain of criminal sanctions, that only \\"safety glazing material\\" be used in all bathroom enclosures. D's managing agent admitted that, since at least 1965, it was customary for landlords who had occasion to install glass for shower enclosures, to replace the glass with \\"some material such as plastic or safety glass\\". P was given the verdict by the jury. The appellate division reversed the decision awarding P damages; D was under no common law duty to replace the glass unless he had prior notice of the danger. P appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed and ordered a new trial. Judgment The question asked was, does custom and usage per se fix the scope of the reasonable person standard? The response of the court was, custom and usage is highly relevant evidence related to the reasonable person standard but it does not per se define the scope of negligence. Judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg gave the following decision. Legal analysis Custom and usage evidence is highly relevant to a determination of whether an actor used reasonable care under the circumstances. Such evidence tends to show that taking the omitted precaution that resulted in harm was technologically and economically feasible and that the harm itself was foreseeable. Custom and usage evidence is not treated as negligence per se: the jury or fact finder must still determine if the custom and usage is reasonable. Thus, custom and usage are merely evidence of what ought to be done (often highly persuasive evidence), but evidence of custom and usage must still be reconciled with the reasonable person standard. Custom and usage are not conclusive evidence of negligence. See also *US tort law T.J.Hooper, 60 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1932) (opinion by Judge Learned Hand). External links *Case Brief for Trimarco v.

Publication history  Launched in October 1939, Flyin' Jenny was published both as a daily and Sunday strip, each running a separate storyline. Gladys Parker stepped in to draw Flyin' Jenny from 1942 until 1944, when Keaton's assistant Marc Swayze took over.Lambiek: Gladys Parker After Keaton died in 1945 (at the age of 35), Swayze and scripter Glenn Chaffin made an effort to keep Jenny airborne, but it became difficult to devise adventures equal to those of the World War II years. The strip began to lose its popularity and was discontinued in 1946. Characters and story Initially a test pilot at the Starcraft Aviation Factory, Jenny encountered spies, saboteurs and criminals. Since the strip began simultaneously with the start of World War II, Jenny was active in wartime escapades. Keaton's widow, Virginia Keaton Anderson, recalled how he devised the name of the central character. He originally planned to name the strip's heroine Virginia Dare. Delighted that he wanted to use her name, Virginia Keaton cautioned, \\"Russell, I'm not criticizing, but historians might. Remember, Virginia Dare was the name of the first child born of English parents in this country. Why don't you name her Virginia something else?\\" Keaton explained that he had specific reasons for choosing his character's last name as well as the first: \\"No, I want to name her Dare because I'm going to make her a daring young aviatrix.\\" Then he had an idea: \\"Jenny is a nickname for Virginia. I'll name her Jenny Dare.\\"The Aviation Art of Russell Keaton (Kitchen Sink Press, 1995), p. 16.

Originally, the term t∆∞∆°ng refers to a salty paste made from fermented soybeans, which is popular in vegetarian meals, particularly those prepared and eaten by Vietnamese Buddhist monks. It is also the most typical dipping sauce for summer rolls (g·ªèi cu·ªën). The paste, which is generally dark brown in color, is produced by adding the fungus Aspergillus oryzae to roasted soybeans, which are then allowed to naturally ferment in a jar with water until it develops an umami flavor. Other ingredients, such as glutinous rice or maize powder, salt, or water, may also be used. T∆∞∆°ng is similar to the Chinese yellow soybean paste, though the latter is generally saltier and thicker in texture. T∆∞∆°ng may range in consistency from a thick paste to a thin liquid. Some varieties, such as that prepared in Central Vietnam, are watery, with solids at the bottom of the container in which it is stored. A more condensed variety, called t∆∞∆°ng B·∫ßn or t∆∞∆°ng l√†ng B·∫ßn, is produced in the town of B·∫ßn Y√™n Nh√¢n, in M·ªπ H√†o district of H∆∞ng Y√™n Province, in the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam, and takes its name from the name of the town. Other varieties of t∆∞∆°ng are similarly named for the towns or districts in which they are made, such as t∆∞∆°ng Ph·ªë Hi·∫øn (made in a township of H∆∞ng Y√™n Province), t∆∞∆°ng Nam ƒê√†n (made in a district of Ngh·ªá An Province), t∆∞∆°ng C·ª± ƒê√† (made in a town in H√† T√¢y Province) and t∆∞∆°ng ch√πa M√≠a (ƒê∆∞·ªùng L√¢m village, H√† T√¢y Province). In Southern Vietnam, it is called t∆∞∆°ng h·ªôt. T∆∞∆°ng is commercially available in glass and plastic jars and bottles throughout Vietnam, as well as in Vietnamese grocery stores overseas. The word t∆∞∆°ng can also be used to refer to other condiments, such as t∆∞∆°ng c√† (tomato sauce), t∆∞∆°ng x√≠ mu·ªôi (plum sauce) or t∆∞∆°ng ·ªõt (chilli sauce). In southern Vietnam, n∆∞·ªõc t∆∞∆°ng refers to soy sauce while Northern Vietnam calls it x√¨ d·∫ßu.

The cathedral, formerly a collegiate church, is dedicated to Saint Deodatus of Nevers. Since 1777 it has been the seat of the Bishop of Saint- Di√©. Building description The cathedral, like most of the town, is built largely of the local red sandstone. It has a Romanesque nave (12th century) and a Gothic choir; the portal of red stone dates from the 18th century. A fine cloister (13th century), containing a stone pulpit, communicates with the Petite-√âglise or Notre-Dame de Galil√©e, a well-preserved specimen of Romanesque architecture (12th century). History 13th century stained glass Saint Deodatus of Nevers, the eponymous Saint Di√©,Some sources connect the name with an earlier saint, Deodatus of Blois (d. 525) founded a monastery here in the 7th century and gave up his episcopal functions to retire to this place. In the 10th century the community became a chapter of canons. Among those who subsequently held the rank of provost or dean were Giovanni de Medici, afterwards Pope Leo X, and several princes of the ducal House of Lorraine. Among the extensive privileges enjoyed by them was that of coining money. Though they co-operated in building the town walls, the canons and the dukes of Lorraine soon became rivals for authority over the town of Saint-Di√©, where towards the end of the 15th century one of the earliest printing presses of Lorraine was founded. The institution of a town council in 1628, and the establishment in 1777 of the bishopric which appropriated part of their spiritual jurisdiction, contributed greatly to diminish the influence of the canons; and with the French Revolution they were completely swept away. Their church remains as the cathedral.

Herzog, Ct. of App. of N.Y., 228 N Y. 164, 126 N.E. 814 (1920), was a New York Court of Appeals case. Facts Martin (P) appealed the order of the Appellate Division that reversed a judgment entered after jury trial that found Herzog (D) negligent and P blameless. Martin (P) was driving his buggy on the night of August 21, 1915. P was killed in a collision between his buggy and Herzog's (D) car. It was dark when the accident occurred. P was driving without lights and D did not keep to the right of the center of the highway. P alleged that D was driving on the wrong side of the road. D claimed that P was contributorily negligent for driving without headlights as required under the law. In the body of the charge the trial judge said that the jury could consider the absence of light \\"in determining whether the plaintiff's intestate was guilty of contributory negligence in failing to have a light upon the buggy as provided by law. I do not mean to say that the absence of light necessarily makes him negligent, but it is a fact for your consideration.\\" D requested a ruling that the absence of a light on the plaintiff's vehicle was \\"prima facie evidence of contributory negligence.\\" This request was refused, and the jury were again instructed that they might consider the absence of lights as some evidence of negligence, but that it was not conclusive evidence. P then requested a charge that \\"the fact that the plaintiff's intestate was driving without a light is not negligence in itself,\\" and to this the court acceded. The jury was instructed that they were at liberty to treat the omission of the lights either as innocent or as culpable. The jury gave the verdict to P. The Appellate Division reversed that verdict. P appealed to the Court of Appeals. Issue Does a jury have the power to relax the duty that one traveler on the highway owes under a statute to another on the same highway? Is negligent conduct actionable by itself unless there is a showing that such conduct was the cause of the injuries incurred? Rule of law The unexcused violation of a statutory duty is negligence per se and a jury does not have the power to relax the duty that one traveler on the highway owes under a statute to another on the same highway. Negligent conduct is not actionable by itself unless there is a showing that such conduct was the cause of the injuries incurred. Holding and decision Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo gave the following judgment. Dissent Judge John W. Hogan read the following. Legal analysis of Martin v. Herzog Martin v. Herzog demonstrates the following principles of tort law: 1\\\\. Violation of a statute is negligence per se. 2\\\\. Under the doctrine of contributory negligence, the plaintiff's negligence is a complete defense. If the plaintiff's negligence was a cause of the injury, the plaintiff is barred from recovery. In an opinion written by Benjamin N. Cardozo, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the Appellate Division's ruling that the trial judge's jury instruction was erroneous. The trial judge had instructed the jury to consider the plaintiff's statutory violation when determining whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. The Court of Appeals held that the question of contributory negligence should not have been submitted to the jury. The plaintiff's violation of the statute was not mere evidence of negligence to be considered by the fact-finder; it was negligence as a matter of law. The statute requiring highway travelers to have headlights codified the common law duty of one highway traveler to another. In failing to have headlights on his buggy, the plaintiff's intestate breached a duty of care to other highway travelers. (Cf. Tedla v. Ellman, where the plaintiffs' violation of a statute was not negligent because, in their particular situation, violating the statute was safer than adhering to it.) If a plaintiff's negligence per se is to be contributory negligence, it must be a cause of the injury. In Martin v. Herzog, the Court of Appeals found the plaintiff's traveling without lights an hour after sundown to be prima facie sufficient evidence of negligence contributing to the accident. Causation issues A dissenting opinion by John W. Hogan countered that the plaintiff's negligence was not a contributing cause of the accident because the defendant was driving on the wrong side of the road. The dissenting opinion sets out the jury's findings of fact, which were affirmed by the Appellate Division: (A) the defendant was driving his car on the wrong side of the road; (B) the plaintiff's intestate was driving his buggy to the extreme right of the road; and (C) the highway was well lighted, such that witnesses could see the body of the plaintiff's intestate from forty feet away.

The term can also be used figuratively to refer to all of the time, talents, skills, materials, compassion, and financial means of the members of the church that are available to be applied in the service of the needy.LDS Church (2004). Providing in the Lord's Way: A Leader's Guide to Welfare p. 8. there are 138 bishop's storehouses in operation. Origin Replica pioneer home and Bishop's Storehouse to the left. Stirling Agricultural Village, Alberta. The Newel K. Whitney Store in Kirtland, Ohio. The concept of the bishop's storehouse is based on a revelation received by Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, on February 9, 1831, whereby he was instructed to keep goods \\"in my [the Lord's] storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy\\".Doctrine and Covenants 42:33‚Äì34, 55. The first bishop's storehouse was established in Bishop Newel K. Whitney's store in Kirtland, Ohio. Operation Most of the goods in the storehouse are purchased with fast offering funds or produced on church-owned agricultural property. The storehouses are staffed by volunteers or church service missionaries. Persons in need, whether members of the church or not, can access the storehouse by approaching a bishop or local Relief Society president. The bishop decides whether or not the person will be given assistance and works with the Relief Society president in determining what the person will be given. The usual practice is to ask the recipient to work or render some form of service in exchange for the good given them. Bishop's storehouses are not commercial entities and goods are generally not for sale to the public through them. Building vs. available resources There are buildings owned throughout the world that serve as bishop's storehouses. In areas of the world without a dedicated building, the bishop can render assistance by purchasing food and household necessities with church fast offering funds and delivering the goods to the recipient. This may also be done when the recipient has special dietary needs not catered to through the storehouse. The bishop can also draw on the \\"storehouse\\" of church members' available time, talents, and abilities to assist the needy.

Ellman (280 N.Y. 124, 19 N.E. 2d 987) was a 1939 New York Court of Appeals case that was influential in establishing the bounds of the negligence per se doctrine. Ordinarily, a statutory violation constitutes negligence. However, the court, in an opinion written by Irving Lehman, instead held that because this violation occurred in a situation not anticipated by the drafters of the statute and was in keeping with the spirit of the statute, it did not constitute negligence. Facts Anna Tedla and her brother, John Bachek (plaintiffs), were struck by a passing automobile, operated by the defendant, Ellman. Tedla was injured and Bachek was killed. Bachek was a deaf-mute. The plaintiff had engaged in collecting and selling junk. They picked up junk at the incinerator of the village of Islip, New York. At the time of the accident, plaintiffs were walking along and wheeling baby carriages containing junk and wood. It was about six o'clock on a Sunday evening in December. Bachek was carrying a lighted lantern. The jury found that the accident was due solely to the negligence of the operator of the automobile. The place of the accident consisted of two roadways, separated by a grass plot. There were no footpaths along the highway and the center grass plot was soft. It is not unlawful for a pedestrian, wheeling a baby carriage, to use the roadway under such circumstances. The Vehicle and Traffic Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 71) provided that \\"Pedestrians walking or remaining on the paved portion, or traveled part of a roadway shall be subject to, and comply with, the rules governing vehicles, with respect to meeting and turning out, except that such pedestrians shall keep to the left of the center line thereof, and turn to their left instead of right side thereof, so as to permit all vehicles passing them in either direction to pass on their right. Such pedestrians shall not be subject to the rules governing vehicles as to giving signals.\\" The plaintiffs did not and were not observing the statutory rule. At the time of the accident, they were proceeding in easterly direction on the east-bound or right-hand roadway. Procedural history The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground, among others, that violation of the statutory rule constitutes contributory negligence as a matter of law. The trial judge left to the jury the question whether failure to observe the statutory rule was a proximate cause of the accident. The trial judge found for P, which the appellate division affirmed. On this appeal, D argues the pedestrians were contributorily negligent as a matter of law for violating the statute. Ellman appealed an order from the Appellate Division affirming a judgment entered upon a verdict in favor of Tedla in their action for negligence. Issue and holding The court delivered the following decision. Analysis This is part of the violation of statute argument used under negligence per se. However, violation of statute will not be negligence per se if there is an excuse for that violation; such as the one given in this case. So the statute will create a general duty of care but that does not alleviate the common law duties of care nor the duty to act as a reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances. One such excuse for deviation is a greater and unreasonable danger being faced while adhering to the statute. We agree with the court that only a fool would walk on the side where the traffic is extremely heavy as opposed to walking on the side where the traffic is light. So part of the prima facie case related to statutes must include a determination whether the violation of the statute was excused.

An initial police enquiry concluded that sixteen Aboriginals were killed and their remains burnt. Subsequently, a Royal Commission was organised in 1927 to further investigate the matter. This Commission found that twenty Aboriginals were murdered and burnt at several different locations. Two Western Australian police constables who participated in the punitive expedition that led to the massacre, James St Jack and Denis Regan, were charged with murder and arrested. Despite the findings of the commission and police investigation, the case never went to trial, with a preliminary hearing concluding that a jury would not be able to make a conviction. Lumbia, the Aboriginal man who killed the pastoralist Frederick Hay, was, however, convicted in a separate proceeding. The total number of victims of the punitive expedition led by St Jack and Regan is unclear with the lowest conclusion being that of sixteen given by the 1926 police investigation and the highest being in the hundreds given by the brother of one of the participants in the massacre. Regardless of official police and governmental investigations concluding that a large number of people were killed during the police operation, denials of this massacre continue to the present day. Background In 1926, Leopold Rupert Overheu and Frederick Hay jointly held the Nulla Nulla property near Wyndham in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Their property bordered the Forrest River Aboriginal Mission (later renamed Oombulgurri) run by Reverend Ernest Gribble. Over previous years, Frederick Hay had repeatedly taken and molested Aboriginal women with Gribble making complaints to authorities about his behaviour. In 1924 Hay had also seriously injured an Aboriginal man after hitting him over the head with his rifle butt. Hay and Overheu complained about the spearing of their cattle by local Aboriginal people, Overheu claiming the value of the speared cattle to be ¬£10,000. In response, their property was declared a prohibited area under the 1905 Aborigines Act preventing Aborigines from entering or crossing it to reach other areas. Initial massacre at Durragee On 18 May 1926, Overheu made a formal complaint that a large group of Aboriginal people were spearing cattle at Nulla Nulla. Constable James St Jack of the Western Australia Police based at Wyndham was directed to investigate this killing of cattle. St Jack with his two Aboriginal assistants, Windie Joe and Jacob, set out from Wyndham and met up with Overheu and his Aboriginal servants Tommy Doort and Lyddie on the lower Pentecost River. The group then travelled toward the Nulla Nulla property and camped for the night near Durragee Hill, close to where around 300 Aboriginal people were holding a ceremony on an island in the river. At dawn on 24 May, St Jack armed Windie Joe, Jacob and Tommy with shotguns and the patrol rushed the camp to disperse the Aborigines. Those who survived reported that many were injured and that two older men, Blui-Nua and Umbillie were killed by being beaten over the head with a stirrup iron or a rifle butt. An eyewitness to the Durragee Hill attack, Gladys Birch, many years later stated that several women and children were herded to the top of a cliff and pushed off while nine men were shot and thrown in a bonfire at Durragee. St Jack and Overheu testified later that they had shot no humans but had shot 31 dogs. However, witnesses described people being wounded by both bullets and shotgun pellets. After the dispersal at Durragee, the patrol continued to the Nulla Nulla Homestead arriving after dark to find Frederick Hay missing. The next morning Windie and Tommy were sent to try and find Hay. Hay's body was found later that same day north-east of the homestead. The killing of Frederick Hay On 23 May 1926, an Aboriginal man named Lumbia and his child-wives, Anulgoo and Goolool, were resting at Johnson Billabong on the Nulla Nulla property when Hay rode up and demanded sex with Anulgoo. Hay then stripped down to his boots and raped her in front of Lumbia before indicating an intention to take her back to the Nulla Nulla with him. When Lumbia objected Hay attacked him with his stock- whip then broke his spears. Without bothering to dress Hay gathered his clothes, mounted his horse and began to ride off but Lumbia grabbed a broken shovel spear and stabbed him in the back with it, killing him. Anulgoo later stated that, during the argument, Hay had shot at Lumbia, and the bullet grazed his head. Hay's pistol was found to have a spent cartridge in the chamber. When Hay's body was found by the search party led by Constable St Jack, it had been largely consumed by predators and initially it could not be determined whether the remains were those of a white man or an Aborigine. According to the police report the body still wore boots when found, which revealed white skin when removed. The district medical officer at Wyndham, Dr Arthur Adams, arrived from Wyndham two days later to conduct Hay's autopsy following which, due to the advanced state of decomposition, was buried at the spot. St Jack and Overheu at this time had no knowledge that Lumbia had killed Hay and assumed that a large group of Aboriginals were instead responsible for Hay's murder. On hearing of Hay's death, another armed group was organised at Wyndham where Richard Jolly and Bernard O'Leary were sworn in as special constables under the supervision of Constable Denis Regan. Overheu expressed that he wanted a strong armed force to go out and \\"deal drastically\\" with the local native people. Forrest River punitive expedition Regan's patrol left Wyndham on 1 June meeting up with St Jack's patrol at a place called Jowa in the headwaters of the Forrest River on 5 June. In the days before Regan's group arrived, it appears that St Jack and Overheu had already been conducting extrajudicial killings of local Aboriginals in the area with Overheu's Aboriginal servant Tommy Doort later admitting to killing a woman and her baby during this time. Members of the police patrol The combined police patrol that met at Jowa on 5 June now consisted of 13 men and a woman. It was led by two constables of the Western Australia Police. * Constable James Graham St Jack, from Wyndham police station. * Constable Denis Hastings Regan, from Turkey Creek police station. They were accompanied by two civilians sworn in as special constables, namely: * Bernard Patrick O'Leary. Pastoralist at Galway Valley Station. * Richard John Jolly. Unemployed labourer. Two others, a settler and a veterinary surgeon, accompanied the force: * Leopold Rupert Overheu. Hay's partner on the Nulla Nulla station. * Daniel Murnane. An Australian government veterinary surgeon from Victoria. Five Aboriginal trackers, three professional police trackers and a further two hired for the job. * Jim McDonald (Mulga Jim) Police tracker born in Northern Territory. * Frank. Police tracker from Turkey Creek. * Jacob. Police tracker from Wyndham. * Windie Joe. Special police tracker. * Sulieman. Afghan/Aboriginal tracker. In addition, there were a further three members of the group. * Charlie. Aboriginal servant of O'Leary. * Tommy Doort. Aboriginal servant of Overheu. * Lyddie Goolara. Wife of Tommy and servant of Overheu. All members with the exception of Lyddie were armed with .44 Winchester rifles. Additionally all the whites carried sidearms and the Aborigines were also given shotguns to replace their rifles when raiding camps. The patrol took 500 rounds of ammunition and were later supplied with a further 350 rounds (seven empty ammunition boxes were later found at one of the police camps). Although Regan was required to supply a written report accounting for every shot fired and to collect and return all used shell casings as proof, he never did so. 42 pack horses and mules carried the supplies for this substantial punitive expedition. First stage of the Forrest River massacre On 6 June, the police patrol travelled to a place known as Wodgil in the upper reaches of the Forrest River. Here they camped for two days where they managed to round up and take prisoner a number of Aboriginals. Seven of these, 4 males and 3 females, were forcibly taken to nearby creek beds named Gotegotemerrie and Mowerie. At the former site the four men were killed and their remains burnt in makeshift ground ovens covered in large flat rocks. At the latter site, the three women were likewise disposed of. The remnant ashes, teeth and bone fragments were then dumped in the shallow pools of the creek beds. On 10 June the police patrol moved on to another site known as Police Camp No. 3 some kilometres to the north of Wodgil. Here they rounded up another nine local Aboriginal people, 5 males and 4 females. They were taken to a nearby ravine where they were killed and their remains burnt in a large contained bonfire. The ashes and the burnt remains, including thousands of fragments of bones, were later discovered dumped next to the killing site in the ravine. On 14 June the group raided a large encampment of Aboriginal people and took 34 prisoners. They interrogated their captives about the killing of Hay but apparently later released them with no casualties. By this stage the punitive expedition was running low on supplies and the group's leaders decided to go to the Nulla Nulla homestead and the Forrest River mission to resupply. After arriving at Nulla Nulla, Daniel Murnane, a visiting veterinary surgeon who had volunteered for the patrol as he was a friend of Hay, decided to leave the expedition and return to Wyndham. On 19 June Murnane arrived at Wyndham where he gave initial reports about the punitive expedition. It was alleged that he said that \\"it was worse than the war\\" and that he \\"had enough of it\\", statements that he later denied. Upon hearing these reports, Sergeant Arthur Buckland, who was in charge of the Wyndham police, decided to recall the patrol and he left to rendezvous with them at the Forrest River mission. Second stage of the Forrest River massacre The Reverend Ernest Gribble at the Forrest River mission had already heard reports that the patrol had killed several Aborigines and was worried that other innocent Aborigines might be killed. When members of the patrol arrived at the mission for supplies, he informed them that the local Aboriginal people had told him that Lumbia had killed Hay. Gribble advised them that they should be able to find Lumbia near the Lyne River to the north of the mission. The Aboriginal community at the mission supported the arrest of Lumbia, and Gribble supplied two Aboriginal men from the mission, Aldoa and Herbert, to guide the patrol to Lumbia. Sergeant Buckland arrived at the mission on 24 June to recall the punitive expedition but as the police were now searching for a specific suspect, he allowed it to continue, albeit in a reduced form. Buckland took Jolly back to Wyndham with him, while Overheu and O'Leary and their Aboriginal servants returned to Nulla Nulla. The police patrol now consisted of constables Regan and St Jack, accompanied by four Aboriginal trackers Mulga Jim, Frank, Windie Joe and Sulieman. The patrol also now included Aldoa and Herbert, the guides from the mission. The group set out to arrest Lumbia and arrived at a place called Dala near the Lyne River on 27 June. Here they captured two men and two women named Gumbol, Boondung, Bungomerrie and Newringie. Constables St Jack and Regan took these prisoners to a nearby creek bed away from the police camp where they chained them to a tree and shot them dead. They then burnt the prisoners' remains in a fire and dumped the resultant ashes and bone fragments in a shallow waterhole in the creek bed. On 1 July the patrol raided a large encampment of Aboriginal people on the Lyne River. Here they captured Lumbia and took 30 other people prisoner. They then proceeded back to the Forrest River mission with these prisoners and arrived on the outskirts of the mission settlement on 4 July. Gribble heard of the patrol's arrival and was concerned that some of these prisoners would be summarily executed. He made his way to the police camp and convinced Regan and St Jack to release all their captives apart from Lumbia and three others. Lumbia was then questioned through an interpreter and confessed to having killed Hay. Investigations Initial reports of killings While the punitive expedition was being conducted, various verbal reports of the killings were given by Aboriginal people to Gribble and by Murnane to the public at Wyndham when he opted out of the patrol. In the weeks following the conclusion of the police patrol, several Aboriginal people attended the Forrest River mission with bullet wounds. C.R. Herschell, the managing director for Path√© films in Victoria, happened to be visiting the Forrest River mission at that time and was able to take multiple photographs and movie films of the wounded survivors and grieving relatives. Additionally, Overheu's servant Tommy talked about the massacres he participated in to some bush Aborigines who passed on the story to Gribble. Overheu found out about Tommy's conversations and Tommy soon after disappeared. He was assumed to have been shot by Overheu. Rev. Gribble calculated that 30 men and women were missing who he suspected had been killed by the police party. Local Aborigines claimed up to 100 men women and children had been killed. In 1968, Charles Overheu stated that his brother Leopold, who was a member of the police patrol, had told him that the patrol had killed at least 300. Police investigation On 12 August Rev. Gribble, accompanied by Inspector E. C. Mitchell of the Western Australian Aborigines Department in Wyndham, visited two of the massacre sites at Mowerie and Gotegotemerrie. Mitchell reported that he found considerable evidence of attempts to clean up the site and that he had recovered a quantity of intact human teeth and skull fragments from the ashes of a large fire nearby. Mitchell sent a telegram to the Chief Protector, A.O. Neville: \\"Shocking revelations, saw place Forrest River, rocky higher bed where natives chained small tree killed there then bodies burnt improvised oven\\".The evidence for The Forrest River Massacre Quadrant Magazine 1 July 2003 Two weeks later, the chief of police in the Kimberley region, Inspector William Douglas, personally conducted an extensive investigation of some of the massacre sites. At one site he noted finding dark stains that had human hairs attached on a rock slab behind a tree near where the fire had been. Accompanied by Suleiman, an Aboriginal tracker who participated in the massacres, Douglas traced the movements of the police patrol from Mowerie and Gotegotemerrie to the ravine near Police Camp No.3. Sulieman stated that Regan, O'Leary and Murnane led nine prisoners in chains into the ravine, returning the next morning alone. Here Douglas \\"found the remains of a large fire and some thousands of fragments of bone in the ashes\\". At most of the sites much of the ash had been scooped from the fires and thrown into nearby billabongs where charcoal and bone fragments were still visible on the bottom. Douglas later sent other officers to investigate the massacre site at Dala where similar evidence of shooting, burning and dumping of human remains was found. Douglas' official report to the police commissioner stated that \\"sixteen natives were burned in three lots; one, six and nine; only fragments of bone not larger than one inch remain\\". Wood Royal Commission Douglas' report was handed to Robert Connell the Western Australia police commissioner, who recommended a Royal Commission be organised. The Premier of Western Australia, Philip Collier, approved the creation of the Royal Commission to be overseen by George Tuttle Wood. This 1927 Wood Royal Commission was tasked to investigate the killing and burning of bodies of Aborigines in the vicinity of the Forrest River Mission and the disappearance of key witnesses. Many witnesses retracted statements, refused to testify or simply disappeared and several key Aboriginal witnesses to the killings \\"escaped\\" from custody at Wyndham before they could give evidence to the commission. No legal assistance was given to represent the Aboriginal case, while a police subscription fund organised by Leopold Overheu was able to pay for a respected legal counsel in Walter Nairn to defend the police and settlers. Commissioner Wood observed that the constables lied consistently during the inquiry and the testimonies given by most of the members of the police patrol was unreliable. Wood was able to conduct part of the inquiry at the Forrest River region where he saw firsthand the Dala massacre site and was firmly convinced of the physical evidence he found there. The Royal Commission of inquiry concluded that 11 people had been murdered and their bodies burned at Gotegotemerrie, Mowerie and Dala, with a further 9 people meeting a similar fate at a separate site named Police Camp No.3. Trial of James St Jack and Denis Regan On the recommendation of the Royal Commission, constables James St Jack and Denis Regan were arrested and charged in May 1927 with the murder of Boondung at the massacre site of Dala. However, at a preliminary hearing, the case against St Jack and Regan was dismissed by Magistrate Alfred Kidson as he viewed the evidence as being \\"insufficient to justify its being placed before a jury\\". The two constables were reinstated to their positions but later transferred out of the Kimberley region. Aftermath Lumbia Lumbia (on left) following his arrest in 1926 On 28 October 1926, at the trial for the murder of Hay, Lumbia had neither legal representation nor a translator. While in the dock he fled but was recaptured and chained to a post. The trial continued and the verdict delivered in his absence. The initial death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after it was argued that Hay had provoked the attack. Lumbia was imprisoned on Rottnest Island until the prison was closed in 1929 when he was transferred to the Broome Regional Prison. In 1935 he was sent to the Moola Bulla settlement near Halls Creek. In 1936 he walked to the Forrest River Mission and no attempts were made to return him to finish his sentence. In December 1944 Lumbia killed his second wife, Waldjanurri, and was sentenced to death for murder; he escaped and was recaptured but was released after serving two weeks for the escape. Sent back to Moola Bulla he contracted leprosy and returned to Forrest River where he died in 1950. Leopold Overheu Leopold Overheu quit the Nulla Nulla property in 1927 and moved to Perth. He was a son of a prominent Pingelly farmer in Heinreich Overheu, and was able to re-establish himself at Donnybrook where he died in 1949. Leopold's only son, Donald Overheu, was a pioneer of computing in Australia and became principal of the College of Advanced Education in Canberra. James St Jack Constable James St Jack remained with the Western Australia police and was stationed at various places around the state including Perth, Kojonup, Bunbury and Carnarvon. His wife, Florence Drage, died in 1937 and he married his second wife, Annie Leabeter, a year later. He had several children. St Jack rose to the rank of sergeant and retired in 1960. He died at Shoalwater, Western Australia in 1993. Denis Regan Constable Denis Regan also remained with the Western Australia police and was posted to similar locations to St Jack including Perth and Kojonup. He married Emily Finch in 1928 but had an affair with Valma Jaffrey in 1942 which caused his divorce and resignation from the police force. He later lived around Kalgoorlie and died in Perth in 1966. Daniel Murnane Daniel Murnane continued his career as a veterinary officer and later also obtained the rank of major in the Australian military. He became a principal research officer in the CSIRO and won the Australian Veterinary Association's highest honour in the Gilruth Prize in 1968. He died in 1970. His daughter, Merrilyn Murnane, was a respected paediatrician and she established the $25,000 Dr Daniel Murnane Scholarship for students at Ormond College at the University of Melbourne. Later evidence In January 1968, Dr Neville Green interviewed on audiotape Charles Overheu, the brother of Hay's partner and co-owner of Nulla Nulla station Leopold Overheu: > They all got together up there and there was a bloody massacre because I > think they shot about three hundred natives all in one hit and there was a > hell of a row over it. It was all published in the papers and somebody let > the cat out of the bag and anyhow the government and the judges in those > times they realised what the trouble was and the whole thing was hushed up > you see. In the same year, Forrest River Aborigines specified that the massacres had taken place at five different sites, and a German scholar, Dr Helmut Reim, from interviews with three Aboriginal elders, concluded that between 80 and 100 Aborigines had been killed in the massacres on the Marndoc Reserve, of which the Forrest River Mission was a small part. Denials of the massacres During the proceedings of the 1927 Royal Commission, George Tuttle Wood who oversaw the proceedings, commented that a \\"conspiracy of silence\\" blanketed the testimonies given to the inquest. Witnesses either disappeared or were otherwise influenced to not testify or give misleading statements. Wood found that constables St Jack and Regan and other members of the patrol consistently lied to the commission to protect themselves and that they denied any killings despite the existence of written, verbal and physical evidence. Denials of any massacre occurring at Forrest River continues to the present day with the Western Australia Police refusing to acknowledge that this massacre occurred. Conservative commentators over the years since the Forrest River massacres have occasionally produced articles denying it ever happened. For instance, in 1999 journalist Rod Moran published a book Massacre Myth arguing that the massacres were the invention of Reverend Gribble. This is despite the official police and governmental investigations concluding that at least 11 to 20 people were killed by the police patrol. Most historians agree with the general conclusions of the Royal Commission, though without committing themselves to a specific number of victims.

They can be produced industrially, for example, by the addition of ethylene oxide onto fatty alcohols in the presence of suitable catalysts (layer compounds which have been calcined or hydrophobized with fatty acids).Reviews on this subject are presented, for example, by M. Cox in J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 67, 599 (1990) and by H. Hensen et al. in Seifen-Ole-Fette-Wachse, 117, 592 (1991). This process can also be carried out on a variety of other hydrophobes and using different alkoxylating compounds (e.g., propylene oxide and butylene oxide) by modifying the catalyst properties. Example An ethoxylation reaction proceeds under an inert atmosphere with an amount of heat depending on the starting material. The reaction proceeds via the epoxide (in this case ethylene oxide) ring opening and activation of the nucleophile, ring, or combination thereof via the catalyst. Image:EpoxOpen.png With conventional catalysts (i.e. potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, etc.) one obtains a distribution of ethoxymers. If one targets a 12 mole ethoxylate with a conventional alkaline earth hydroxide, one could expect to get a broad range of ethoxylates with n being anywhere from 3 to 30 moles of EO. With narrow- range catalysts a much tighter distribution can be obtained. Narrow-range surfactants like alcohol ethoxylates and propoxylates can be incorporated into alkyl ether sulfates or mixed with other anionic surfactants and exhibit beneficial properties such as reduced irritation to skin/eyes and lower free alcohol content.

Particles lack a meaning independent of a phrase or clause. For the most part, they impart meaning to the phrase or clause in which they occur. Ilocano has two morphological types: enclitic and independent. Enclitic Enclitic particles are very similar to the enclitic pronouns, in that they are tightly bound to the previous word with which they have a close relation. And, similar to the pronouns, their form depends on the last sound of the preceding word. These particles occur primarily with the Predicate of the sentence or clause. -(e)n The punctual particle lends the meaning of completion and punctuality or amazement. The speaker asserts that the idea expressed in the predicate is completed, or to emphasize that it is currently underway. Or, it can express an intense emotion. * Forms: ** -en - After consonants and diphthongs ** -n - After simple vowels * With Verb Predicates The particle lends the meaning of now, presently, with progressive formations. Mapmapanen He's going now! In the negative, the particle has the meaning of any more. Saanen nga agtudtudo. It is not raining any more. Or, that a decision was made. Saandan nga umay. They aren't coming any more. (They changed their minds.) With the perfective, the idea is that the action had completed before the utterance. Napanen He's already gone Immayen He came already When used in conjunction with the Future Particle -(n)to, the idea is that the action will have been completed some time in the future, in other words, a future perfect. Mapanton He will have left Umayton He will have come * With Noun Predicates Nouns do not show aspect, in other words, completion or non-completion. Nevertheless, noun predicates with -(e)n express some form of perfective aspect and assertion of a fact. Also, -(e)n can impart the speaker's surprise that the fact is contrary to previous assumptions. 1) Balayen! It's (now) a house! 2) Balasangen ni Julia. Julia is (now) a young lady. In example 1, the speaker is amazed. The speaker could have assumed that it was going to be another type of building. In example 2, the speaker had not visited Julia for a long time. * With Pronouns Pronouns used with this particle stand out among a set of others. Isunan! Let him be the one! (No one else wants to do it. He's the only one who is capable.) Dagitoyen ti aramatekto. These are the ones that I'll be using. (I don't want to use the others.) * With Adjective Predicates Similar to nouns, -(e)n imparts perfectiveness. Atiddogen ti buokna. Her hair is already long The perfective particle commonly accompanies the Nag- formation and adds further emphasis and adds wonderment. Naglab-ayen! How bland! Naddakkelen dayta a balay! That house is so big! -(n)sa The speculative particle lends the meaning of speculation or wonderment or uncertainty on behalf of the speaker. *Forms: ** -nsa - After simple vowels ** -sa - After consonants and diphthongs Pinataydansa ni Osama bin Laden. They must have killed Osama bin Laden. They might have killed Osama bin Laden. I think they killed Osama bin Laden. When used with -(e)n, the speculation is about something that may have occurred in the past, but the speaker is not sure about the validity of the statement. Nataysan ni Elvis. I think Elvis has died. Impandansan idiay ospital. I think that they sent her to the hospital. -(n)to The future is expressed with -(n)to attached to the Neutral form of the verb. It has two forms: * -nto - After simple vowels * -to - Elsewhere: consonants and diphthongs (e.g., -ay, oy, etc.) Examples: Mapanakto I will go. Makitanto It will be seen. Independent Independent particles are words in their own right and do not attach to the previous word. apo Respect particle. Used in addressing superiors or strangers. It can be used with titles of family members, their names or titles of authority. Wen, apo. Yes, ma'am/sir. Adda tao, apo. (Announcement that you have arrived and are entering the house, lit. There are people. aya Particle used in questions expressing wonder, surprise or doubt. Ammom aya ti maipapanna? I wonder if you know what it means? Nabangsit aya ti bugguong? Really, 'bugguong' is smelly? bassit An adjective in its own right, bassit means small. But, as a particle, it is used to express a very short period of time. It can also be used in commands to express what is requested of the listener is trivial and/or will not take too long. Umayka man bassit. Please come (here) (for a bit/short while). biit Used to express a short period of time. Similar to bassit, it can be used in requests and softens the tone. Umayka man biit Please, come over. di Negative particle. * It has no difference in meaning with saan. Like saan, personal pronouns and enclitic particles attach to it. Unlike saan, however, the ligature, a/nga, is not needed. Saanda nga immay. Dida immay. They did not come Saankayonto a mangan iti panrabii. Dikayonto mangan iti panrabii. You (plu.) will not eat dinner. But, if the personal pronoun is ko, it is replaced by ak. Saanko met nga ammo. Diak met ammo. (Diko met ammo does not occur) I don't know. Saankon a maibaga. Diakon maibaga. I can no longer tell it. * Used to create the negative or opposite of adjectives or other modifying elements. Similar to the negating prefixes in English: un-, in-, il-, ir-, etc. ginagara intentional, intended, intent di- ginagara unintentional simpa steady, flat, level di-nasimpa unsteady * Sometimes used to introduce the apodosis in contrary-to-fact sentences. No pay koma nasapaka a napan, di nakitam ni lolam a Maria.

So, their party is on Sunday. I thought it was tomorrow. Kasta gayam! So, it's going to be that way! So be it! (Said in concession) Kasta gayam kadi? Is it going to be that way? Is it like that? * Expresses the speaker's sudden recollection of something previous forgotten. Adda gayam tulbekko That's right. I have a key. kadi * Question particle. Similar to Tagalog \\"ba\\", Japanese \\"ka\\", and Chinese \\"ma.\\" Nanganka iti mangga. You ate a mango. (Statement) Nanganka kadi iti mangga? Did you eat (a) mango. (Question) * Used in questions that implore the listener. Ikkannak ti pirak kadi? Will you please give me money? Mabalin kadi daytoy? Is it possible? * When used in a contrary fashion, it comes close to sarcasm. Napanka kadi idiay eskuela. You went to the school (so you say...) * Softens commands as a question. Umayka man kadi? Can you come here? *Used to counter a negative statement. Saan a pudno. It is not true. Pudno kadi. It is true, indeed.' kano Hearsay. Reporting particle that expresses that the information is second-hand; he said, she said, they said, it was said, reportedly, supposedly, allegedly. Ania a kita ti prutas ti kayat ni Boboy? Kayatna ti saba, kano. What kind of fruit does Boboy want? He said, he wants bananas. kas(la) Particle used in expressing similarity: like, as. Agsassao kasla Tagalog. He speaks like a Tagalog. ketdi Used to express the speaker's negative attitude toward the situation or fact being discussed. It is often used with -n attached to it or to the subject of the sentence. It is also used concede or counter what was expected. Imbagak nga bassit ti kuartami. Ginantangna ketdin diay sapatos. I told her that we don't have much money. She bought the shoes anyway. ketno Condition particle, expresses the unexpected condition to happen, if. koma (kuma) The optative particle is used to express the following: * Hope or necessity Agadalda koma a nalaing. They should study hard. Pinilim koma 'ta nalabbaga. You should have chosen the red one (instead). * The protasis of contrary-to-fact sentences No simmangpetak koma a nasapa, di saanko maikapis ti kasangayna. If I had only arrived earlier, then I wouldn't have missed her birthday. * In commands to entreat or make a plea to the listener Saanmo koma iparuar diay aso. Please, don't take the dog out. Pumanawka koma. Please, leave. * In the idiom Sapay koma ta, I hope (that). Sapay koma ta rumuar ti init. I hope (that) the sun comes out. Sapay koma ta umimbag ni lola. I hope grandmother gets well. la/laeng A limitative particle: only, just. Kayatna ti makan iti paria laeng. He like to eat only bitter melon. Siak la ti makiammo. I'm the only who should know. latta * Limitative particle. It is interchangeable with la/laeng in most cases. Sika latta Sika laeng Only you * In other situations, it imparts precision (just this one and no other) or finality (this is it, I've made up my mind). The above examples can also be interpreted in the following manner. Sika latta You alone, It's up to you (and no one else) Sika laeng Only you Napan latta. Dinak pay inasikaso. He went on ahead. He didn't even pay any attention to me. Note how pay is used. It indicates how he continued to ignore the speaker. It does not have a one-to-one translation. man * Used with imperatives. Softens the tone to a request. Manang Biday, ilukatmo man 'ta bintana. (Older sister) Biday, please open the window. * When used as a response, it expresses the speakers frustration. A: Immayda kadi? B: Saan man. A: Did they come? B: No (and I am frustrated that they haven't yet). * When used with interrogative words, it forms the indefinite series of pronouns. Aniaman or Ania man Whatever met Conversation shift particle. * Adds what is being said to what was previously mentioned: also, too. Kayatko met ti agbuya ti sine. I want to watch a movie, too. Naimbag nga aldawmo. Sika met. Have a nice day. You, too. * Shifts the focus of the conversation from one subject or matter to another. Sika met? What about you? Sika met! So, it was you! * In negative sentences, the addition of met compounds the speaker's pessimism towards the situation. Dida met immay. They didn't even come. * Also, it can be used in contrary statements. Tallo met dagiti bituen ti watawat ti Pilipinas. But, there are three stars on the Philippine flag. Kastoy met? So, it's like this? (Sarcastic) What the hell? Like this? * Used for emphasis. Sika met! You! Adda met ipis iti balayda. There are cockroaches at their house. ngamin/gamin Asserts the speaker's attitude toward the cause of some action: because. The speaker may have a negative or contrary attitude. It is as if the speaker is saying, \\"If only you did what I told you...\\", \\"Regardless of what was said, I think that...\\" Nabuong ngamin dagitoy baso, ta saanmo ida inkabil idiay lababo. The glasses broke, because you didn't put them in the sink. (I thought you should have done that instead of leaving them on the floor) Nalipatam ngamin. That's because you forgot it. (Of course, you don't have them on you!) (You just had to forget them. Now, we have to go back and get them) Napintas ngamin. It's beautiful (to me). (I don't care what you think) NOTE: Gapu (ta) is the neutral word for because and the formal and literary counterpart of ngamin. ngarud * Used to express a result, i.e., then, so; or an affirmation, indeed. Intan ngaruden. Well, let's go then Nagpudoten ti balay. Ilukatmo ti ridaw ngarud. The house is so warm. Go ahead and open the door. Notice the use of -(e)n for emphasis. * Change of decision. Saanko kayat mapan idiay sine, ngem awan met ti aramidek ditoy balay. Intan ngarud. I don't want to go to the movies, but I don't have anything to do here at home. So let's go. * Adverbial phrases into ngarud no if, in case that anansa ngarud therefore, wherefore ngata Probability * Used mostly in questions to solicit the opinion of the listener as the speaker is uncertain. Nangabak ngata ni Juan? Do you think Juan won? * In negative statements, likewise, expresses the uncertainty of the speaker. Saan ngata a nangabak ni Juan. Juan probably didn't win. * In positive statements, expresses the speakers speculation. Napanda ngata binisita ni adingda a masakit. They might have visited their younger sister who's sick. ngay Elicitation Used in questions when the speaker encourages the listener for a response. Anya ngay nabuyam idiay sine idi rabii? What did you watch at the Movie Theater last night? (It's because I want to know. Please, tell me.) pay * Pay can be considered the opposite to -(e)n. It has the meaning of continuation, whereas -(e)n denotes punctuality. Whereas, some particles can co-occur within the same phrase, pay and -(e)n are mutually exclusive. Matmaturog pay ni manong. Older brother is still sleeping. Contrast with... Matmaturongen ni manong. Older brother is already sleeping. Other examples: Ania ti orasnan? Alas dos pay. What time is it now? It's still two o'clock. Adda ni Peping idiay tindaan? Awan pay. Is Pepe at the store?

In 1986, they recorded a single called \\"At The Party\\" on the Honey Hush label. The group is often cited as the first bilingual rap group, and is possibly the first ever Latin hip hop group.

About a year and a half later, they were knocking on the doors of Sugar Hill Records and auditioning for Sylvia Robinson and her crew. They rapped in both English and in Spanish making them one of the first bilingual rap groups around. Sylvia loved the idea of making a bilingual rap record and released their first single \\"Disco Dream\\" in the summer of 1981. Some of D.J. Julio's lyrics used on the track were actually borrowed from Son of Sam of the Harlem World Crew with his permission. Hispanics all over the country went crazy over the group when they heard Spanish rap for the first time. This of course lead to the opening of doors to Latin America. The group was shelved by Sugar Hill following a radio interview they did with Frankie Crocker at New York‚Äôs WBLS. One of the members said something about the label that didn‚Äôt sit well. Later the group went on to record some songs under the Honey Hush Label. Jimmy Mac died and so did Cool Cliff may they rest in peace.

Main Features of Cephalopod Evolution. The Mollusca Vol. 12 Paleontology and Neontology of Cephalopds; Academic Pres Inc. Occurrence Plectronoceratids are known from the Upper Cambrian (upper Franconian ‚Äì middle Trempealeauan) of China and North America (Minnesota, Wisconsin). Two families are recognized (Flower, 1964),Flower, Rousseau H. 1964. The Nautiloid Order Ellesmeroceratida (Cephalopoda); Memoir 12, New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, Socorro, New Mexico the generally straight to endogastric Plectronoceratidae and the slightly exogastric Balkoceratidae. Diagnostic characters Members of the Plectronocerida are characterized as follows. Shells are generally small, some even tiny, laterally compressed, curved (cyrtochonic) or straight (orthoconic). Most cyrtoconic forms are endogastric, with the ventral side longitudinally concave, or the dorsal side more longitudinally convex. A few, the two known genera in Balkoceratidae are exogastrically curved, with the ventral side convex and dorsal side concave. Septa are close spaced, in some less than a millimeter. Siphuncles are ventral, and in most, proportionally large. Connecting rings are in general poorly calcified and may expand as siphonal bulbs into the chambers where not restricted by septal necks. As with all shelled cephalopods, plectronocerids had a tube called a siphuncle, which let them fill the chambers of their phragmocone with gas instead of water, thus controlling their buoyancy. They were not, however, adapted for jet- powered swimming. Phylogeny The Plectronoceratida gave rise in the Late Cambrian (early and middle Trempealeauan) to the other three plectronoceratoid orders, the Ellesmerocerida and Protactinocerida and Yanhecerida. The Plectronoceratidae gave rise to the other ellesmerocerid families, including the Upper Cambrian exogastric Balkoceratidea, and with remote possibility to the Discosorida. The Balkoceratidae are unrelated to later exogastric forms that first appeared in the Ordovician. Ecology Plectronocerids were probably benthic animals that crawled along the bottom in search of food or safety, facing downwards, with the shell carried above. Nothing is known of their specific soft-part anatomy or to what extent tentacles, if any, had developed.

Her task was to carry stores, refrigerated items, and equipment to ships in the fleet, and to remote stations and staging areas. Zelima was laid down on 5 December 1944 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Company under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1212) as Golden Rocket; launched on 2 March 1945; sponsored by Mrs. J. W. Greenslade; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 16 July 1945. She was operated by the United Fruit Co. under a contract with the War Shipping Administration for almost a year. Turned over to the Navy in the summer of 1946, she was renamed Zelima; converted to a stores ship at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard; and commissioned on 27 July 1946. Pacific Ocean assignment With her home port at San Francisco, California, Zelima spent her first four years of active service carrying provisions and other supplies from the U.S. West Coast to Japan and other points in the Pacific occupied by American forces. On the return voyages, she often carried servicemen returning home after service in the Far East. Korean War operations The eruption of hostilities in Korea during the summer of 1950 brought an increase in workload for all ships in the Pacific Fleet Service Force, and Zelima was no exception. She saw constant duty in the combat zone carrying thousands of tons of food and other supplies to the ships of the U.S. 7th Fleet operating off the Korean coast as well as to U.S. Army and United States Marine Corps units ashore and to Air Force squadrons flying daily sorties from the islands surrounding the Korean peninsula. Post-Korean War activity With the winding down of the Korean War in 1953, Zelima resumed her peacetime chores of supplying the American bases spread throughout the Pacific Ocean. However, periodic crises brought her back into potentially dangerous situations. During the waning months of 1958‚Äîwhen the Chinese communists brought their guns to bear on the Nationalist Chinese-held, offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu -- Zelima replenished units of the 7th Fleet patrolling the Taiwan Strait and delivered badly needed supplies to Americans stationed on Taiwan itself. Later, in the fall of 1961, she operated off the coast of Vietnam servicing fleet units sent there as a result of an intensification of guerrilla activity in that strife- torn land. Cuban crisis support A year later, she moved clear across the Pacific to the western coast of Panama where she replenished ships headed toward the Panama Canal on their way to join the \\"quarantine\\" of Cuba imposed by President John F. Kennedy in his successful gesture to secure the removal of Russian missiles from that island. Vietnam operations The spring of 1963 saw her return to the Far East and, more specifically, to the waters off Vietnam. Following that visit in April and May, she resumed her normal routine for about 16 months. After the Gulf of Tonkin incident spurred an even more rapid acceleration in American involvement, Zelima's visits to Vietnamese waters became more regularized and frequent. By the latter 1960's, she made two, sometimes as many as three or four, replenishment visits per year to the ports and coastal waters of Vietnam bringing supplies to both ships at sea and men ashore. The Vietnam War dominated the remainder of her career, for she went out of service almost three years before the conflict ended early in 1973. Her last tour of duty off the Vietnamese coast came in May and June 1969. Decommissioning Zelima was decommissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in September 1969. She was turned over to the Maritime Administration for berthing in its National Defense Reserve Fleet group at Suisun Bay, California, in June 1970. Her name was struck from the Navy List near the end of 1976, and ownership of the ship was transferred to the Maritime Administration. As of January 1979, she remained in the custody of the Maritime Administration. Final Disposition: she was disposed of by MARAD sale, fate unknown. Military awards and honors Zelima earned one battle star during the Korean War: * First UN Counter Offensive She was awarded six battle stars for Vietnamese service. Five are recorded: * Vietnam Defense Campaign * Vietnam Counteroffensive *Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase V * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase VI * Tet 69/ Counteroffensive Her crew was eligible for the following medals: *National Defense Service Medal (2) *Korean Service Medal (1) *Armed Forces Service Medal (3-Korea, 10-Quemoy-Matsu, 6-Vietnam){This award not authorized for any U.S. military personnel before June 1, 1992} (not retroactive) *Vietnam Service Medal (5) *United Nations Service Medal *Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal *Republic of Korea War Service Medal (retroactive) References : External links * Category:Ships built in Oakland, California Category:1945 ships Category:World War II merchant ships of the United States Category:Alstede-class stores ships Category:Cold War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Korean War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Vietnam War auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Zelima"},{"id":"13027464","text":"The Monash Science Technology Research and Innovation Precinct (STRIP) is a cluster of commercial and university enterprises and research centres based at Monash University's Clayton Campus.

Opera News said that, \\"Although his timbre lacked the innate beauty of some of his baritone contemporaries, Valdengo's performances were invariably satisfying ‚Äî bold and assured in attack but scrupulously musical.\\" Biography Valdengo first studied the cello and oboe before turning to vocal studies with Accoriti in his native Turin. He made his operatic debut as Figaro in Il barbiere di Siviglia, at the Teatro Regio di Parma in 1936. Shortly thereafter he made his Teatro alla Scala debut, as Germont in La traviata. He was drafted into military service in 1939 by the Italian government and did not appear on the stage for the next three years. His opera career recommenced in 1942 with a lauded performance of Marcello in La boh√®me at Parma. Valdengo made his American debut at the New York City Opera as Sharpless in Madama Butterfly in 1946. He remained on that company's roster through the spring 1948 season, singing the title role in Rigoletto, Tonio in Pagliacci, Escamillo in Carmen and Giorgio Germont in La Traviata. He was also a regular performer at the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company between 1946‚Äì1948, singing Amonasro in Aida, the Count di Luna in Il trovatore, Rigoletto, and Valentin in Charles Gounod's Faust. In September 1947 he made his San Francisco Opera debut as Valentin. Valdengo first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera was on December 19, 1947 as Tonio with Licia Albanese as Nedda and Raoul Jobin as Canio. He remained at the Met for seven seasons, portraying such roles as Amonasro, Belcore in L'elisir d'amore, Figaro in Il barbiere di Siviglia, Lescaut in Manon Lescaut, Marcello in La boheme, and Paolo Albiani in Simon Boccanegra among others. His final and 121st performance at the Met was as Germont on January 27, 1954 with Jean Fenn as Violetta and Jan Peerce as Alfredo.http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm During the 1950s Valdengo sang in most of the principal European opera houses, most often portraying roles from the Verdi baritone repertory. Some of his notable engagements during the mid-1950s included appearances at Op√©ra de Paris as Rigoletto and Raimbaud in Le comte Ory for the 1955 Glyndebourne Festival where he later returned to sing the title role in Mozart's Don Giovanni. He also sang Captain Balstrode in Peter Grimes at the Rome Opera and the title role in Prince Igor at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. He also sang in other American houses. In 1953 he made his debut with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company as Iago in Verdi's Otello, returning there to sing Sharpless (1954), Valentin (1955, 1959), and Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor (1959). He retired from the stage in 1966 and taught in Turin. After his retirement he still recorded some buffo roles in Italy: Don Pasquale, don Bartolo and Dulcamara (see the Abridged discography). A famous pupil of him is the baritone Alessandro Corbelli. Valdengo published his autobiography Ho cantato con Toscanini in 1962. Valdengo may be best-remembered for his NBC radio broadcasts of Otello (1947, as Iago), Aida (1949, as Amonasro), and Falstaff (1950, as the title role), with Arturo Toscanini conducting. (All of these operas were performed in concert versions.)

It is owned by the Blickle family. Since its founding in 1931, the company has been headquartered in Bruchsal, Germany. SEW EURODRIVE produces gear units, motors, gearmotors and inverter technology in various sizes for diverse industries and applications. Not only does the company produce compact drives in the motor power range from 0.09 kW to 225 kW but also powerful industrial gear units with input torques of up to several million Nm. Within the context of Industry 4.0, SEWEURODRIVE offers solutions for the Lean Smart Factory, including mobile assembly and logistics assistants and digital factory planning. History and background SEW-EURODRIVE has applied for a large number of patents since it was founded almost 90 years ago. The company, managed by the third generation of the Blickle family, focuses on becoming a smart company, combining the concepts of Industry 4.0 with the principles of Lean management. With versatile and adaptable factories, SEW-EURODRIVE aims for more customized solutions. In SEW- EURODRIVE's showcase factory at its production and logistics plant in Graben- Neudorf, which has been operated since 2016, mobile logistics assistants and networked production islands open up new possibilities regarding production processes. The beginnings under Ernst Blickle It all started with the designer Albert Obermoser. His geared motor, designed in 1928, revolutionized drive technology. Christian P√§hr, a trained banker, recognized the enormous potential of that drive design and acquired the rights to the geared motor from the bankrupt estate of Obermoser AG. Despite economic and political turmoil, he took a bold step and founded the company \\"S√ºddeutsche- Elektromotoren-Werke\\" in 1931, known since 1971 as SEW-EURODRIVE. Just a few years later in 1935, when Christian P√§hr died, his wife Kunigunde P√§hr took over the company with the support of their daughter Edeltraut P√§hr. In 1945, Ernst Wilhelm Blickle, Christian P√§hr‚Äôs son-in-law, took over as managing director of the company. Until 1945, when the Allied Strategic Command bombed Bruchsal into rubble, SEW produced motors. After Germany's surrender the company became an entity of the US‚Äîvia the Marshall Plan. When this was concluded in 1948, the company was returned to its owners, the Blickles. Due to increasing production demands following the economic growth after the war, Ernst Blickle laid the cornerstone for a 10,000 square meter manufacturing facility in Graben, ten kilometers away. In the wake of a plant expansion at a later time, Ernst Blickle also had social rooms constructed for his employees and training workshops. In 1965, SEW-EURODRIVE presented its innovative modular system for gearmotors. With few basic components, customers are able to quickly configure an end product perfectly tailored to their needs. With this concept, production and assembly can be organized separately from each other. This means that production is organized centrally in a small number of plants with high volumes while assembly is performed as close as possible to the customer. This ensures a greater degree of customization with short delivery times. After the death of Ernst Blickle in 1987, his sons Rainer and J√ºrgen Blickle took over as managing partners of SEW-EURODRIVE. International expansion In 1960, SEW-EURODRIVE opened its first foreign subsidiary ‚Äì SEW-USOCOME ‚Äì in Haguenau, Alsace. Between 1968 and 1969, the company began expanding by opening assembly plants in Sweden, Italy and England. In 1974, the first employees started their work at SEW-EURODRIVE in Canada, which was the beginning of the American expansion of the company. In 1975 and 1978, the company continued on its course of international expansion by opening production and assembly plants in the US and Brazil. In the 1980s, new sites in the metropolises Melbourne (Australia) and Johannesburg (South Africa) were established. Assembly plants in Japan and Singapore marked the beginning of the Asian expansion. SEW-EURODRIVE has already had its presence in Russia since 1993. With production and assembly sites constructed in 1994, the Asian expansion continued and SEW-EURODRIVE established itself on the Asian market. Following this expansion, a new branch opened in India in 1997. Key figures More than 17,000 employees at over 430 sites worldwide generate sales of over 3 billion euros. SEW-EURODRIVE has 16 production and 79 assembly plants around the world, so-called Drive Technology Centers. 23% of the employees are engineers and computer scientists.

The colour blue was chosen to contrast with the conservative \\"whites\\" and to emphasise their distinction from the Communist \\"reds\\". The term dates back to the Revolt in the Vend√©e when the counter- revolutionary Whites called the troops of the revolutionary government \\"the blues\\" (because of their uniforms). The organisation arose from the Bretons de Paris, established by Armand Dayot and Ary Renan (son of Ernest Renan). It grew in Brittany from dissatisfaction with the conservative and clerical bias of the existing Breton Regionalist Union, founded a few months earlier. It was centred in the French-speaking east of Brittany and was strongest among the urban middle-class of the larger east-Breton towns. However it established branches throughout Brittany.Loic Thomas, \\"Armand Dayot et la ligue des bleus de Bretagne\\", Colloque - les Bleus de Bretagne de la revolution a nos jours, Archives departmental de Saint-Brieuc, 1990, pp. 351-62 It included a number of influential writers, artists and politicians. Notable members were Yves Le Febvre, Jean Boucher, Armel Beaufils, Anatole Le Braz, Pierre-Paul Guieysse and Jean-Bertrand P√©got-Ogier. The organisation worked to emphasise modernity and French identity, in contrast to the emphasis being placed by some Breton nationalists on the traditional Breton peasant Catholic culture and the preservation of the Breton language. The group promoted the commemoration of liberal and revolutionary heroes, organizing the creation of statues of Lazare Hoche in Quiberon and Ernest Renan in Tr√©guier.Vytas Gaigalas, Ernest Renan and his French Catholic Critics, The Christopher Publishing House, 1971, pp.281 After 1905 its activity shifted to annual congresses, held across the major Breton towns.

History The Mikuni Pass separated the Kant≈ç region from Echigo Province in ancient Japan. As such, it has long been used as a major transportation hub for travelers going between those two areas. During the Edo period, the Mikuni Kaid≈ç was established with the purpose of helping daimy≈ç who were participating in sankin k≈çtai, which required daimy≈ç to spend a portion of their time in Edo. In 1902, the Shin'etsu Main Line was built, the first train line through the area. As a result, the economies of many of the post towns began to falter. However, the area between Nagaoka and Yuzawa was able to continue to flourish because the flat land allowed them to pursue agriculture. The area across the Mikuni Pass, however, received very little traffic. In 1953, as cars became more common, so did long-distance transport, which led to a great rise in traffic in the area. However, for cars traveling between the Kant≈ç and Echigo regions, it was very inconvenient to take the same detour as the train line, so the prefecture began major repair and construction work along the Mikuni Kaid≈ç.

Biography Gulski was born in Che≈Çmno, then part of West Prussia in 1847, son of Antoni Gulski (musician) and Anna Schewa, his birth name was Franciscus Joannes . In 1866 he joined the Franciscans and was ordained at Laki, German partition of Poland, entering the priesthood on September 21, 1873. That same year, his friary was closed as a result of the Kulturkampf. Gulski spent two years in hiding and eventually fled in 1875 via Antwerp to the United States, where he was offered a pastorship in Berlin, Wisconsin. The following year, he was transferred to St. Stanislaus Catholic Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the principal Polish parish in the city. Under Gulski's guidance, \\"St. Stan\\" grew; a new US$4000 pipe organ was added to the church and its spires covered in copper. During his pastorate, in 1882 a record 96 marriages were performed in the church. The church was now serving 400 families, an increase from the original 30. A new rectory was built that same year. Eventually, even this large church could no longer cope with the numbers wishing to attend mass. Gulski left St. Stanislaus to organize the new St. Hyacinth parish, which was located just west of St. Stanislaus. Many were surprised by this move, as obviously St. Stanislaus was a prestigious posting for a priest. However, Father Gulski had a missionary zeal to build houses of worship for his beloved Polish community in Milwaukee. A location was chosen on West Becher and South 15th Streets to construct the new church with the support of Archbishop Michael Heiss. In addition, a school, hall, rectory, and convent were built on the site. Although not as elegant as St. Stanislaus, the parishioners felt the austere lines were conducive to prayer and meditation. The church, seated 800 worshipers, was blessed on April 1, 1883. Gulski was a gifted orator, and many of Milwaukee's south side residents preferred to attend mass at St. Hyacinth because of his beautiful homilies. Gulski's gift for singing earned him the nickname of the \\"Polish Nightingale\\". By 1888, the two parishes on the south side could no longer cope with the increased population. Gulski was instrumental in organizing the new parishes of St. Vincent's in 1888, and SS. Cyril and Methodius in 1893, to accommodate the rising number of Polish speaking worshipers. Gulski convinced the Polish Sisters of St. Felix of Cantalice to come to Milwaukee and establish an orphanage there. Ground was broken in 1907, and the following year 46 boys and 39 girls were welcomed at St. Joseph Orphan Asylum. Other Polish parishes in Milwaukee offered shelter to orphans, as well as to young ladies with unplanned pregnancies who were often rejected by their families. It was felt that a Polish orphanage was necessary to preserve the ethnic heritage of the children so that they would not be lost to the American cultural \\"melting pot\\". For his efforts, Gulski was honored with the title of Monsignor. Gulski presented the city of Milwaukee with a large statue of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko for Kosciusko Park that was paid for by private donations. Eventually internal problems emerged in his parish. Discord in his beloved \\"Jackowo\\" in 1909 lead to his transfer to St. Hedwig's (Milwaukee) for two years. He was replaced at St. Hyacinth by Boleslaus Goral. Death claimed Gulski in 1911. Many believed that by having been forced to leave his beloved St. Hyacinth parish, which he had built from the ground up, Gulski died of a broken heart.

The original title was to be \\"Laugh Literary and Man the Fucking Guns,\\" but Cherkovski convinced Bukowski to substitute a less graphic word due to censorship concerns. In the late 1960s, the U.S. Post Office was actively prosecuting publishers for sending \\"obscene\\" publications through the mail. At the time of its publication, Bukowski was working as a clerk at the Post Office, having not yet made the transition to full-time writer. The mimeographed octavo publication was published by Bukowski and Cherkovski's Los Angeles Laugh Literary press. The first edition in 1969 was 32 pages long, stapled inside of yellow printed wrappers; it contained poems, correspondence, and illustrations by Bukowski. Other contributions were by Douglas Blazek, Roger Margolis, Jack Micheline, Steve Richmond, Jerome Rothenberg and Thomas F. Sexton. The cover of the first edition featured a manifesto by Bukowski that railed against Poetry Magazine and \\"the dull dumpling pattycake safe Creeleys, Olsons, Dickeys, Merwins, Nemerovs and Merediths.\\" Bukowski intended his magazine to be an alternative to Black Mountain Review and its Black Mountain poets, such as Robert Creeley. According to Howard Sounes' biography Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life, Bukowski proved a poor editor in this, his second stint at editing a literary magazine. (He had co-edited \\"Harlequin\\" with his first wife Barbara Frye in the 1950s.) Upset with the poor quality of the submissions, Bukowski would write insulting remarks to writers who submitted their work, even going so far as deface some of their submissions. > I think that the miracle of our times is that so many people can write down > so many words that mean absolutely nothing. Try it sometime. It's almost > impossible to write down words that mean absolutely nothing, but they can do > it, and they do it continually and relentlessly. I put out 3 issues of a > little, Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns. The material received was > so totally inept that the other editor and myself were forced to write most > of the poems. He'd write the first half of one poem, then I'd finish it. > Then I'd go the first half of another and he'd finish it. Then we'd sit > around and get to the names: \\"Let's see, whatta we gonna call this > cocksucker?\\" The \\"little\\" literary magazine was part of the 1960s \\"mimeograph revolution\\" and helped make Bukowski a well-known poet. Ever the iconoclast, Bukowski denounced the trend. In the May 1973 issue of Small Press Review, he wrote: \\"... [W]ith the discovery of the mimeo machine everybody became an editor, all with great flair, very little expense and no results at all.\\" The second edition of the magazine was edited by Bukowski, Cherkovski, and \\"contributing editor\\" Harold Norse, a friend of Bukowski who had helped his career by encouraging publishing house Penguin to publish Bukowski in an anthology with him. (Norse's work had appeared in the first issue.) The second issue included the Bukowski poems \\"The Grand Pricks of the Hob-Nailed Sun\\" and \\"I Thought I Was Going to Get Some,\\" as well as some Bukowski illustrations. It is rumored that Bukowski wrote poems under pseudonyms as they were not able to get enough publishable material. References Sources Bukowski, Charles.

The most distinguished of all sixteenth-century French secretaries,Sutherland, 150, Villeroy rose to prominence during the French Wars of Religion, a period of almost insoluble difficulties for the French monarchy and government. Despite faithfully serving Henry III, Villeroy found himself sacked by him without explanation in 1588, along with all the king's ministers. He was reinstated by Henry IV in 1594 and became more important than ever before. He remained in office until his death in 1617 during the reign of Louis XIII. Villeroy grew up at court and entered government service at a young age, following in the footsteps of his father Nicolas III de Neufville, and both grandfathers.Sutherland, 151. In 1559, at the age of sixteen, he became a financial secretary and was soon employed by Catherine de' Medici, the widow of Henry II and the mother of the next three kings. Because those kings were either too young, too ill, or, in Henry III's case, too irresponsible to attend to the details of administration, Catherine took control of the government. In order to manage, she formed around her a core of trusted ministers, including Villeroy. In 1567, at the age of twenty-four, Villeroy became a secretary of state in succession to his father-in-law, Claude II de l'Aubespine. His wife, Madeleine de l‚ÄôAubespine,Madeleine de l'Aubespine, un talent pass√© par la Cremerie de Paris (1546‚Äì96) whom he probably married in 1561, was not only beautiful but learned enough to translate the epistles of Ovid.Sutherland, 153.\\"Erotica and women in early modern France: Madeleine de l'Aubespine's queer poems\\". Journal of the History of Sexuality, May 01, 2008, Klosowska, Anna Villeroy himself had attended the Coll√®ge de Navarre, but did not remain in education for long enough to achieve high literary style‚ÄîCardinal Richelieu was to say of Villeroy that he possessed excellent judgement without advanced education (non aid√© d'aucunes lettres)‚Äîthough he occasionally wrote poetry himself and knew the poet Ronsard.Ronsard admired Villeroy and said that his only fault was working too late at night. Sutherland, 153‚Äì5. Villeroy and Madelaine had two sons and a daughter, but only one son, named Charles after the king, survived.Sutherland, 156; Charles's daughter, Catherine de Neufville-Villeroy, got married, in 1620, with Jean de Souvr√©; their granddaughter Anne de Souvr√© married the marquis de Louvois in 1662, which sealed a strong alliance between the Villeroy and Le Tellier families ; at the time of Anne de Souvr√©'s marriage, her tutor was Catherine de Neufville-Villeroy's half-brother Nicolas de Neufville-Villeroy, Marshal of France; see Luc-Normand Tellier, Face aux Colbert : les Le Tellier, Vauban, Turgot ... et l'av√®nement du lib√©ralisme, Presses de l'Universit√© du Qu√©bec, 1987, p. 170.Etexte Villeroy remarried after his wife's death in 1596 and had another son, Nicolas, who entered religion, becoming the Abbot of Chaise-Dieu. He was also abb√© commendataire of Mozac, from 1571 - 1610. Villeroy soon became a favourite with the young Charles IX. He was also loved by Catherine de' Medici, and by Henry III until that king became detached and distant towards the end of his reign. Villeroy often found himself responsible for the negotiation of peace treaties. Perhaps his greatest achievement in that field was the Treaty of Fleix of 26 November 1580, which he concluded in one month, bringing to an end a short but dangerous war involving Henry of Navarre (the future Henry IV of France) in the south west of the country.Sutherland, 212‚Äì13. Villeroy formed a strong relationship with Catherine de' Medici. Their letters to each other show mutual trust and respect. \\"You are so wise,\\" Catherine wrote to him concerning the difficulties posed by the behaviour of her son Fran√ßois, Duke of Anjou, \\"that you do not need any further advice about that or any other matter\\".Letter dated 7 February 1581. Sutherland, 219. From 1582, Villeroy found himself tested by the increasingly eccentric behaviour of Henry III, who responded to the mounting disorder in France and to financial pressures by withdrawing to religious retreats and refusing to attend to business in person.Sutherland, 230‚Äì231. For example, he wrote to Villeroy, \\"While I am with the Capuchins if there are any urgent and important things...you should, all of you, show them to the queen without sending them to me\\".Sutherland, 247. Villeroy on one occasion dared to rebuke the king for his interest in a religious foundation ahead of state affairs: > You were King of France before you became the leader of this company and > your conscience requires that you render to royalty that which you owe it, > before rendering to the congregation that which you have promised. You can > excuse yourself from one but not from the other. Sackcloth you wear only > when you choose, but the crown is always upon your head; and it is not less > heavy in this solitude than it is in the midst of your affairs.Sutherland, > 248. Henry also began to shower offices and privileges on his favourites, particularly Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, first duke of √âpernon. In September 1587, in front of the king, √âpernon savagely accused Villeroy of misdirecting funds and acting on his own authority, and he added that if the king were not present, he would have attacked Villeroy physically. The incident shook Villeroy so badly that he remained in his room for two days, too distressed and afraid to return to his work.Sutherland, 278‚Äì9. Villeroy then asked the king if he could leave the court, but the king refused his request. Above all, Villeroy was concerned about his spotless reputation; but he was reassured by the support of the majority at court who hated √âpernon.Sutherland, 279. Catherine de' Medici was shocked at the secretary's treatment and supported Villeroy vigorously, saying she had not been so upset about any matter for a long time. Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy In summer 1588, the king's position became perilous when Henry I, Duke of Guise, and his followers in the Catholic League took control of Paris, co- ordinating their move with the armada that Philip II of Spain had sent against Protestant England. Henry III managed to evade capture; but later that year faced a meeting of the Estates of Blois, packed with his enemies. On 8 September, at Blois, Villeroy received a note from the king dismissing him from his job. Henry dismissed the rest of his chief ministers at the same time. His letter to Villeroy began: > Villeroy, I remain very well contented with your service; do not fail > however to go away to your house where you will stay until I send for you; > do not seek the reason for this my letter, but obey me.Sutherland, 301. Henry offered Villeroy and his colleagues neither explanation nor compensation. No definitive motive for the king's decision has been established by historians. It may merely have been the impulsive act of a man losing touch with reality.Sutherland, 303. On 28 December that year, the king ordered the murder of Henry, Duke of Guise, who was stabbed by the royal bodyguard and died at the foot of the king's bed.Knecht, 266. Eight months later, Henry III was assassinated himself, by a friar called Jacques Cl√©ment.Frieda, 445‚Äì6. After the assassination of Henry III in 1589 and the succession of Henry IV of France, Villeroy at first worked for the Catholic League. Villeroy came back to power in 1594 once Henry IV recanted his Protestant faith and returned to the Catholic fold. An expert on foreign affairs, under Henry IV he was the second minister under Sully. He aided in Sully's downfall in 1611, becoming principal minister. His own ministerial preeminence was challenged by Sillery from 1614 onwards. Villeroy died in 1617 and was buried in the church of Magny-en-Vexin. An effigy of Villeroy in middle age may be seen in the church today, along with those of his father and Magdalene.Sutherland, 157. Villeroy lived near the Louvre in a house that has been in the possession of his family since 1370, the H√¥tel de Villeroy located at the corner of rue des Bourdonnais, rue de la Limace (today absorbed by rue des Halles) and rue des D√©chargeurs. The building was rebuilt in 1640 by his grandson Nicolas V de Villeroy and still exists today.Hotel de Villeroy The historic courtyard can be seen from 9 rue des D√©chargeurs through the windows of the exposition center Cremerie de Paris. The Hotel de Villeroy became a historic Monument in 1984 thus being protected from real estate promotion.Base Merim√©e - French Ministry of Culture  Notes   References  * Frieda, Leonie.

Murphy's knives had a distinctive aluminum handle which was later used on many thousands of Gerber knives. Between 1941 and 1954 Murphy made approximately 90,000 Murphy Combat knives for troops to use in World War II. These knives were marked on the handle Murphy Combat with USA on the obverse side. They were made for servicemen during and after World War II. These knives are now collectible by military knife collectors and are scarce despite the large number made. Murphy Knives also made about one hundred knives a year of a lesser known model called the Clause Combat knife. This knife was unmarked and similar to the Murphy Combat knife with a narrower blade.

The series was filmed in front of a live studio audience and featured an array of sketches filmed in front of various sets to resemble the likes of popular TV shows. In some sketches, Caliendo impersonated multiple characters on screen at once, such as one spoofing a Seinfeld reunion show set in the future where he plays Jerry, George, Kramer, Elaine, and Newman; and another with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as movie critics. Caliendo's castmates from Mad TV, Aries Spears and Mo Collins, guest starred on the show. Pat Kilbane and Pablo Francisco also guest starred but, they weren't on the show when Caliendo was. TBS promoted the show heavily during its baseball coverage, but the show garnered mixed reviews. Advertising TBS aired teaser commercials for the show during its coverage of Major League Baseball during the 2007 postseason. A teaser was also released and shown in movie theaters before the official trailers began. These ads featured Frank dressed up as one of his many characters, often 3‚Äì5 in the same advertisement.

He had 20 more novels and collections published (over half of them in the series featuring Indiana circuit judge Donald Robak, which began with 1971's Deliver Us to Evil) and around 100 short stories. His collaborators in science fiction included Alexei Panshin and Harlan Ellison; he co-wrote one mystery novel (Loose Coins) with fellow Indiana prosecuting attorney Guy M. Townsend. His last novel, Snowbird's Blood, was published in February 2008. Many of his mystery novels were set in the fictitious Bington, a place which combined aspects of Madison and Bloomington. Science fiction fandom Hensley remained active in science fiction fandom throughout his life; the Hensleys were familiar faces at science fiction conventions such as Rivercon and Midwestcon.. Hensley was a First Fandom \\"Dinosaur\\" (which meant he had been active in fandom prior to July 4, 1939), and received the First Fandom Hall of Fame Award in 2006. Papers Many of his papers dealing both with his career as a judge and attorney, and his activities as a writer and science fiction fan, are in the collection of the Lilly Library of Indiana University.

Career  Davey's official record contains 42 winning bouts (including 26 knockouts), 5 losses (2 knockouts), and 2 draws. Some of his more notable opponents included Rocky Graziano, Ike Williams, and Carmen Basilio. He originally boxed for the Michigan State University team, and was a member of Team USA for boxing in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Davey's style was considered unique at the time because he was left-handed and often referred to as a southpaw. This initial upstart resulted in 39 straight wins until he met with Kid Gavil√°n(often written \\"Kid Gavilan\\" at the time) in 1953. The shadow of his first loss followed Davey for a long time: > Davey, a southpaw powderpuff puncher with fancy-Dan footwork, stayed on even > terms with Gavilan for the first two rounds. In Round 3, Gavilan opened up > with one of his famed flurries, pummeling with lefts, rights and his own > uppercutting bolo punch. Davey, bewildered by the barrage, was dumped to the > canvas for a nine count, the first time he had ever been knocked down. From > then on it was just a matter of time, and Gavilan took his time. In Rounds 5 > and 6, Gavilan switched styles and fought southpaw too, \\"just for the fun of > it. The article, entitled \\"Fallen Idol,\\" seemed to tarnish Davey's once pristine boxing career. Shortly after the loss to Gavilan, Davey retired and became Michigan's boxing commissioner. Once his boxing career ended completely, Davey worked in the insurance business and spent much of his time traveling and raising his family.  Family  Davey was born to parents John Leo and Virginia. His mother's side of the family, her maiden name being Pierce, owned a large portion of land in Oscoda, Michigan on Lake Van Etten, which is located beside Wurtsmith Air Force Base. During the Great Depression, Barnard and Virginia Pierce sold most of the land which they owned, including Loud Island, to several developers and private landowners. What land the Pierce family kept and built cottages and homes on resides on a point of land jutting into the waters of Lake Van Etten, giving it the name \\"Pierce's Point.\\" Davey was one of four siblings‚Äî older brother John Leo II, younger brother Berten Edward, and sister Margaret. While Davey spent most of his youth and adulthood in the metro-Detroit area, he summered in Oscoda with his parents and brothers, his wife Patricia, and his nine children: Maureen, Charles Pierce II, Patrick, Cathleen, Colleen, Kerry, Laurie, Michael, and Joseph. In his spare time he traveled much of the world and maintained an active lifestyle, sometimes running marathons into his mid sixties and early seventies. He had 26 grandchildren.  Accident and death  In 1998, while swimming in the ocean, he was picked up by a wave and slammed onto the shore line. He broke a vertebra in his neck, leaving him paralyzed from the neck down. Davey died on December 4, 2002, at the age of 77, of complications resulting from his paralysis.

Each subsystem can make different connections with other subsystems, and this leads to more variation within the system in order to respond to variation in the environment. Differentiation that leads to more variation allows for better responses to the environment, and also for faster evolution (or perhaps sociocultural evolution), which is defined sociologically as a process of selection from variation; the more differentiation (and thus variation) that is available, the better the selection. Introduction Exemplifying Differentiation and System Theory, this photographic mosaic may be perceived as a whole/system (a gull) or as a less complex group of parts. Talcott Parsons was the first major theorist to develop a theory of society consisting of functionally defined sub-system, which emerges from an evolutionary point of view through a cybernetic process of differentiation. Niklas Luhmann, who studied under Talcott Parsons, took the latter's model and changed it in significant ways. Parsons regarded society as the combined activities of its subsystems within the logic of a cybernetic hierarchy. For Parsons, although each subsystem (e.g. his classical quadripartite AGIL scheme or AGIL paradigm) would tend to have self-referential tendencies and follow a related path of structural differentiation, it would occur in a constant interpenetrative communication with the other subsystems and the historical equilibrium between the interpenetrative balance between various subsystem would termine the relative degree in which the structural differentiation between subsystem would occur or not. In contrast to Luhmann, Parsons would highlight that although each subsystem had self-referential capacities and had an internal logic of this own (ultimately located in the pattern maintenance of each system) in historical reality, the actual interaction, communication and mutual enable-ness between the subsystems was crucial not only for each subsystem but for the overall development of the social system (and/or \\"society\\"). In actual history, Parsons maintained that the relative historical strength of various subsystems (including the interpenetrative equilibrium of each subsystem's subsystems) could either block or promote the forces of system-differentiation. Generally, Parsons was of the opinion that the main \\"gatekeeper\\" blocking-promoting question was to be found in the historical codification of the cultural system, including \\"cultural traditions\\" (which Parsons in general regarded as a part of the so-called \\"fiduciary system\\" (which facilitated the normatively defining epicenter of the communication and historical mode of institutionalization between cultural and social system). (For example, the various way Islam has been transferred as a cultural pattern into various social systems (Egypt, Iran, Tunisia, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia etc.) depend on the particular way in which the core Islamic value-symbols has been codified within each particular fiduciary system (which again depend on a serie of various societal and history-related factors)). Within the realm of the cultural traditions Parsons focused particular on the influence of the major world-religions yet he also maintain that in the course of the general rationalization process of the world and the related secularization process, the value-scheme structure of the religious and \\"magic\\" systems would stepwise be \\"transformed\\" into political ideologies, market doctrines, folklore systems, social lifestyles and aesthetic movements (and so on). This transformation Parsons maintain was not so much the destruction of the religious value-schemes (although such a process could also occur) but was generally the way in which \\"religious\\" (and in a broader sense \\"constitutive\\") values would tend to move from a religious-magic and primordial \\"representation\\" to one which was more secularized and more \\"modern\\" in its institutionalized and symbolistic expression; this again would coincide with the increasing relative independence of systems of expressive symbolization vis-a-vis cognitive and evaluative lines of differentiation (for example, the flower-power movement in the 60s and early 70s would be a particular moment in this increased impact on factors of expressive symbolization on the overall interpenetrative mode of the social system. The breakthrough of rock music in the 1950s and the sensual expressiveness of Elvis would be another example, for the way in which expressive symbolization would tend to increase its impact vis-a-vis other factors of system-differentiation, which again according to Parsons was a part of the deeper evolutionary logic, which in part was related to the increased impact of the goal-attachment function of the cultural system and at the same time related the increased factor of institutionalized individualism, which have become a fundamental feature for historical modernity). Luhmann tend to claim that each subsystem has autopoeitic \\"drives\\" of their own. Instead of reducing society as a whole to one of its subsystems, i.e.; Karl Marx and Economics, or Hans Kelsen and Law, Luhmann bases his analysis on the idea that society is a self differentiating system that will, in order to attain mastery over an environment that is always more complex than it, increase its own complexity through a proliferating of subsystems. Although Luhmann claims that society cannot be reduced to any one of its subsystems, his critics maintain that his autopoeitic assumptions make it impossible to \\"constitute\\" a society at all and that Luhmann's theory is inherently self-contradictory. \\"Religion\\" is more extensive than the church, \\"politics\\" transcends the governmental apparatus, and \\"economics\\" encompasses more than the sum total of organizations of production.Stephen Holmes, Charles Larmore, Niklas Luhmann, and James Schmidt (1983). \\"Review: Luhmann in English- The Differentiation of Society\\". Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 12, No.2. Retrieved April 24, 2007 Available: JSTOR Scholarly Journal Archive. There are four types of differentiation: segmentation, stratification, center-periphery, and functional.  Niklas Luhmann  Niklas Luhmann (1927‚Äì1998) was a German sociologist and \\"social systems theorist\\", as well as one of the most prominent modern day thinkers in the sociological systems theory. Luhmann was born in L√ºneburg, Germany, studied law at the University of Freiburg from 1946 to 1949, in 1961 he went to Harvard, where he met and studied under Talcott Parsons, then the world's most influential social systems theorist. In later years, Luhmann dismissed Parsons' theory, developing a rival approach of his own. His magnum opus, Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft (\\"The Society of Society\\"), appeared in 1997 and has been subject to much review and critique since.  Segmentary differentiation  Segmentary differentiation divides parts of the system on the basis of the need to fulfil identical functions over and over. For instance, a car manufacturer may have functionally similar factories for the production of cars at many different locations. Every location is organized in much the same way; each has the same structure and fulfils the same function ‚Äì producing cars.  Stratifactory differentiation  Stratificatory differentiation or social stratification is a vertical differentiation according to rank or status in a system conceived as a hierarchy. Every rank fulfills a particular and distinct function in the system, for instance the manufacturing company president, the plant manager, trickling down to the assembly line worker. In segmentary differentiation inequality is an accidental variance and serves no essential function, however, inequality is systemic in the function of stratified systems. A stratified system is more concerned with the higher ranks (president, manager) than it is with the lower ranks (assembly worker) with regard to \\"influential communication.\\" However, the ranks are dependent on each other and the social system will collapse unless all ranks realize their functions. This type of system tends to necessitate the lower ranks to initiate conflict in order to shift the influential communication to their level.  Center-periphery differentiation  Center-periphery differentiation is a link between Segmentary and Stratificatory, an example is again, automobile firms, may have built factories in other countries, nevertheless the headquarters for the company remains the center ruling, and to whatever extent controlling, the peripheral factories.George Ritzer. 2007. Contemporary Sociological Theory and Its Classical Roots, The Basics, Second Edition. New York, NY: McGraw Hill.  Functional differentiation  Functional differentiation is the form that dominates modern society and is also the most complex form of differentiation. All functions within a system become ascribed to a particular unit or site. Again, citing the automobile firm as an example, it may be \\"functionally differentiated\\" departmentally, having a production department, administration, accounting, planning, personnel, etc. Functional Differentiation tends to be more flexible than Stratifactory, but just as a stratified system is dependent on all rank, in a Functional system if one part fails to fulfill its task, the whole system will have great difficulty surviving. However, as long as each unit is able to fulfill its separate function, the differentiated units become largely independent; functionally differentiated systems are a complex mixture of interdependence and independence. E.g., the planning division may be dependent on the accounting division for economic data, but so long as the data is accurately compiled the planning division can be ignorant of the methodology involved to collect the data, interdependence yet independence.  Code  Code is a way to distinguish elements within a system from those elements not belonging to that system. It is the basic language of a functional system. Examples are truth for the science system, payment for the economic system, legality for the legal system; its purpose is to limit the kinds of permissible communication. According to Luhmann a system will only understand and use its own code, and will not understand nor use the code of another system; there is no way to import the code of one system into another because the systems are closed and can only react to things within their environment.  Understanding the risk of complexity  It is exemplified that in Segmentary differentiation if a segment fails to fulfill its function it does not affect or threaten the larger system. If an auto plant in Michigan stops production this does not threaten the overall system, or the plants in other locations. However, as complexity increases so does the risk of system breakdown. If a rank structure in a Stratified system fails, it threatens the system; a Center-Periphery system might be threatened if the control measure, or the Center/Headquarters failed; and in a Functionally differentiated system, due to the existence of interdependence despite independence the failure of one unit will cause a problem for the social system, possibly leading to its breakdown. The growth of complexity increases the abilities of a system to deal with its environment, but complexity increases the risk of system breakdown. It is important to note that more complex systems do not necessarily exclude less complex systems, in some instances the more complex system may require the existence of the less complex system to function.  Modern social theory  Luhmann uses the operative distinction between system and environment to determine that society is a complex system which replicates the system/environment distinction to form internal subsystems. Science is among these internally differentiated social systems, and within this system is the sub-system sociology. Here, in the system sociology, Luhmann finds himself again, an observer observing society. His knowledge of society as an internally differentiated system is a contingent observation made from within one of the specialized function-systems he observes. He concludes, therefore, that any social theory claiming universal status must take this contingency into account. Once one uses the basic system/environment distinction, then none of the traditional philosophical or sociological distinctions ‚Äì transcendental and empirical, subject and object, ideology and science ‚Äì can eliminate the contingency of enforced selectivity. Thus, Luhmann's theory of social systems breaks not only with all forms of transcendentalism, but with the philosophy of history as well.Eva M. Knodt, and William Rasch (1994). \\"Systems Theory and the System of Theory\\". New German Critique, No. 61, Special Issue on Niklas Luhmann. Retrieved April 24, 2007 Available: JSTOR Scholarly Journal Archive. Luhmann is criticized as being self-referential and repetitive, this is because a system is forced to observe society from within society. Systems theory, for its part, unfolds this paradox with the notion that the observer observes society from within a subsystem (in this case: sociology) of a subsystem (science) of the social system. Its descriptions are thus \\"society of society\\".Niklas Luhmann and Sean Ward (2000). \\"Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft\\". The German Quarterly, Vol. 73, No.2. Retrieved April 24, 2007 Available: JSTOR Scholarly Journal Archive.  Luhmann's critique of political and economic theories of society  Luhmann felt that the society that thematized itself as political society misunderstood itself. It was simply a social system in which a newly differentiated political subsystem had functional primacy. Luhmann analyzes the Marxist approach to an economy based society: In this theory, the concept of economic society is understood to denote a new type of society in which production, and beyond that \\"a metabolically founded system of needs\\" replaces politics as the central social process. From another perspective also characteristic of Marxist thought, the term \\"bourgeois society\\" is meant to signify that a politically defined ruling segment is now replaced as the dominant stratum by the owners of property. Luhmann's reservations concerning not only Marxist, but also bourgeois theories of economic society parallel his criticisms of Aristotelian political philosophy as a theory of political society. Both theories make the understandable error of \\"pars pro toto\\", of taking the part for the whole, which in this context means identifying a social subsystem with the whole of society. The error can be traced to the dramatic nature of the emergence of each subsystem and its functional primacy (for a time) in relation to the other spheres of society. Nevertheless, the functional primacy claimed for the economy should not have led to asserting an economic permeation of all spheres of life. The notion of the economy possessing functional primacy is compatible with the well-known circumstance that the political subsystem not only grew increasingly differentiated (from religion, morals, and customs if not from the economy) but also continued to increase in size and internal complexity over the course of the entire capitalist epoch. For functional primacy need only imply that the internal complexity of a given subsystem is the greatest, and that the new developmental stage of society is characterized by tasks and problems originating primarily in this sphere.Andrew Arato and Niklas Luhmann (1994). \\"Civil Society and Political Theory in the Work of Luhmann and Beyond\\".

It was in operation from 1912 until 2004, when it was replaced with a new tunnel and underground station on a slightly different alignment. Description The Causeway Street elevated began at the Canal Street incline in parallel with the Charlestown Elevated tracks, and after \\"splitting\\" away from it just south of Boston Garden,BostonStreetcars.com's photo of the Causeway St. Elevated/Charlestown Elevated \\"track split\\" south of the Boston Garden turned southwest above Causeway Street with an elevated station at North Station in front of the Boston Garden, and then turned northwest above Lowell Street, before joining the Lechmere Viaduct at Leverett Circle. It was a two-track structure on steel girders, similar to the Charlestown Elevated, Atlantic Avenue Elevated, and Washington Street Elevated, which were opened between 1901 and 1909. The Causeway Street elevated was one of the last pieces of elevated line constructed in Boston, and, except for a short section remaining at Lechmere, was the last section in service. Although initial plans had called for the Cambridge‚ÄìDorchester line to be constructed as an elevated, the Causeway Street elevated was the only elevated in Boston not part of the Orange Line. History Pleasant Street at the North Station elevated station in 1912, just after its opening The Causeway Street elevated tracks in the early 1960s, with the Lechmere Viaduct at lower left and Hotel Madison and Boston Garden and North Station at upper right. The recently cleared land of the West End can also be seen. A Lechmere-bound PCC streetcar train on the Causeway Street elevated in May 1976, next to Central Artery ramps Opening When the Tremont Street subway fully opened in 1898, surface cars entering the subway from East Cambridge had to cross Craigie's Bridge and proceed on surface streets to the Canal Street incline. The trip from Lechmere Point over the bridge was slow and prone to heavy traffic delays. On June 20, 1907, construction began on one mile of elevated track connecting the Canal Street incline to East Cambridge. The project's centerpiece was the arched Lechmere Viaduct crossing the Charles River; other sections included a short elevated in East Cambridge and an elevated line above Causeway Street connecting the viaduct to the Canal Street incline. The first streetcars crossed the new bridge and the Causeway Street elevated in revenue service on June 1, 1912, shortening the ten-minute trip from Lechmere Square to the subway to just three minutes. A single station was built on Causeway Street in front of the Boston and Maine Railroad's terminal, North Union Station, with connections to it as well as the Main Line Elevated station (which had opened in 1901) and the Causeway Street streetcar terminal (opened in 1898). An additional platform at the station was built for Main Line trains running shuttle services between North Union Station and South Station on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated. North Union Station was replaced in 1928 by North Station with the Boston Garden arena on top, prompting minor changes to the station's configuration. When the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed in 1938, and subsequently demolished for scrap metal in 1942, the tracks that once served it were removed from the elevated station, but the abandoned stub trackbed remained part of the station for the remainder of its lifespan. Closure The Causeway Street elevated during deconstruction in September 2004 In 1995, Boston Garden was replaced by the FleetCenter (later renamed TD Garden), whose building was set further back from Causeway Street. Several years later, the Elevated was temporarily extended approximately east along Causeway Street, and the Causeway Street surface terminal closed on March 28, 1997, because Big Dig construction required several maintenance buildings to be constructed along the Elevated's original Causeway Street alignment. As part of environmental remediation to compensate for increased air pollution caused by the Big Dig, the Causeway Street elevated was replaced by a new tunnel under North Station to free up land and to lower noise levels associated with the trains' characteristic screech as they rounded the sharp elevated turns, as well as to remove the light-blocking elevated structure from Causeway Street. The new tunnel is 4 tracks wide under the North Station building. Through trains run on the outer tracks, while the inner two tracks are used for temporarily storing Green line cars and to reverse trains that terminate at North Station. A short siding off the inbound track south of North Station is used for storing construction equipment. On June 25, 2004, the Causeway Street elevated was permanently closed. After a weekend of substitute bus service north of Government Center, Green Line service to the underground North Station \\"superstation\\" began on June 28. During the 2004 Democratic National Convention from July 24 to 29, 2004, the disused Elevated was used as a platform for security personnel. After a year of substitute bus service while the new portal and incline connecting the tunnel to the Lechmere Viaduct were finished, regular service to Lechmere resumed on November 12, 2005. The replacement of the Causeway Street elevated cost $310 million in 2005 dollars.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and represented the Division of Werriwa in the House of Representatives for over 30 years (1919‚Äì1931, 1934‚Äì1952). After the ALP split of 1931 he joined the Lang Labor faction, which was reunited with the official ALP in 1936. In the 1940s Lazzarini held ministerial office in the Curtin and Chifley Governments, serving as Minister for Home Security (1941‚Äì1946), Works (1945), and Department of Works and Housing (1945‚Äì1946). Early life Lazzarini was born on 8 September 1884 in Young, New South Wales. He was the son of Annie (n√©e Stubbs) and Pietro Lazzarini; his older brother Carlo also entered politics. Their mother was an Australian, while their father was born in Italy and came to Australia via the United States. Lazzarini was educated at a Catholic school in Young. Before entering politics he worked as a draper, initially at Holbrook and later at his own business in Wellington. He married Constance Williams in 1916, with whom he had a son and two daughters.

Politics Lazzarini in 1928 Lazzarini won the seat of Werriwa in the 1919 election, when it was a rural electorate that included the Southern Highlands, Goulburn and part of the South West Slopes, including Young. He won re-election at the 1922, 1925, 1928 and 1929 elections when Werriwa had moved eastward to include the Illawarra and Sutherland Shire, but had lost the South West Slopes and some of the Southern Highlands. He was a part of break-away Lang Labor from 1931 to 1936. He lost the seat at the 1931 election and regained it at the 1934 election, when it included the Sydney suburb of Liverpool‚Äîwhich was then semi-rural‚Äîfor the first time and had lost Goulburn. He was Minister for Home Security and Minister assisting the Treasurer in John Curtin's first and second ministry and Minister for Works and Housing in Ben Chifley's first ministry. The Chifley government was defeated at the 1949, but Lazzarini was re-elected for Werriwa, which had been redistributed to lose the llawarra. Lazzarini died of cerebral haemorrhage in the Sydney suburb of Fairfield, survived by his wife, son and two daughters. Gough Whitlam succeeded him in the seat of Werriwa at the 1952 by-election. Carlo Lazzarini is Hubert's brother and was also a member of parliament, and died one month after Hubert.

The film was a co-production among the Edmonton- based television production company ImagiNation, Montreal's Cite-Amerique, and CTV, for CTV's line of television films collectively known as the CTV Signature Series. The film's broadcast premiere was July 2, 2005, on CTV in Canada, and on Lifetime in the United States. Plot Mia Sampson (Sarah Lind), an unpopular girl, is approached at the mall one day to become a model. Even though she thinks modeling is shallow, she thinks it will be a better way to earn money than working for a sushi restaurant and goes to the agency. She poses for photographs which are to be displayed on an Internet website for \\"members only,\\" supposedly so she can be scouted for other modeling jobs. As Mia's membership begins to go up, she begins feeling uncomfortable and also receives disturbing messages from a subscriber known as Gabriel. However, she continues to take shots and even participates in live video chats with the gentlemen of the site. Too late, Mia realizes that she is working for a pornography site and goes to a group called webwatch to uncover the operation. However, since the agency isn't doing anything illegal, the police can't do anything. Mia is disgusted and even though she has earned over 30,000 dollars, she quits, after finding out that a girl younger than her has been hired. Her boss, however, still has full legal rights to her photos and tells her he will keep the website up, as she is the site's most popular \\"model.\\" He does offer, though, to take down the site if Mia will do a 15-minute live web show whose clients have offered a lot of money to see. Mia accepts, as a man at the webwatch station has told her that it will be the evidence the police need to take down the operation. Mia begins the show, but when the police don't show up she cannot bear to finish the show and runs to the webwatch station. The man at the webwatch station is enraged that she didn't finish; he is Gabriel. He tries to force her to finish the show for him privately while he records it, but Mia tries to escape. Luckily, Mia's mom and boyfriend show up as he is attacking her. The film ends with Mia working at a fast food restaurant, her safety restored, the \\"agency\\" shut down, and Gabriel behind bars. However, the ending shot shows a teenage boy going through old photos that Mia had done that are still online ‚Äì proving what her boss stated earlier in the film to her that, whether she quits or not, the girl she became will always be out there.

Published in 1931, it is one of Sackville-West's most popular works and has been adapted for television by the BBC. The novel addresses people's, especially women's, control of their own lives, a subject about which Sackville-West was greatly concerned although often pointing out that she did not consider herself a feminist. The title is taken from the final three words of John Milton's Samson Agonistes. Plot introduction All Passion Spent is written in three parts, primarily from the view of an intimate observer. The first part introduces Lady Slane at the time of her husband's death. She has been the dutiful wife of a ‚Äúgreat man‚Äù in public life, Viceroy of India and a member of the House of Lords. Her children plan to share her care between them much as they divide up the family property but, completely unexpectedly, Lady Slane makes her own choice, proposing to leave fashionable Kensington for a cottage in suburban Hampstead that caught her eye decades earlier, where she will live alone except for her maidservant and please herself ‚Äî for example allowing her descendants to visit only by appointment. Part 1 concludes with Lady Slane's developing friendships with her aged landlord Mr Bucktrout and his equally aged handyman Mr Gosheron. Part 2, shorter than the others, is composed of Lady Slane's thoughts as she muses in the summer sun. She relives youthful events, reviews her life, and considers life's influences and controls, happiness and relationships. Summer is over. Part 3 takes place after Lady Slane has settled into her cottage, her contemplative life, and approaching end. To her initial annoyance, her past life still connects her to people and events. In particular Mr FitzGeorge, a forgotten acquaintance from India who has ever since been in love with her, introduces himself and they form a quiet but playful and understanding friendship. Mr FitzGeorge bequeaths his fortune and outstanding art collection to Lady Slane, causing great consternation amongst her children. Lady Slane, avoiding the responsibility of vast wealth, gives FitzGeorge's collection and fortune to the state, much to her children's disgust and her maid's amusement. Lady Slane discovers that relinquishing the fortune has permitted Deborah, her great-granddaughter, to break off her engagement and pursue music, Deborah taking the path that Lady Slane herself could not. Characters Lady Slane (Lady Holland, Deborah Lee). The central character, an 88-year-old woman who, towards the end of her life, is emancipated by her husband's death. Sharing much with Sackville-West, Lady Slane explicitly states that she is not a feminist and considers such issues to be questions of human rights, while acknowledging the more difficult position of women. Mr FitzGeorge. An acquaintance from Lady Slane's distant past as Vicereine of India, millionaire by inheritance, lover of beauty and fine art. An eccentric who lives as a pauper. Genoux. Lady Slane's 86-year-old French maid and companion, who has served Lady Slane her entire adult life. Mr Bucktrout.

A builder, of advanced years, introduced by Mr Bucktrout to renovate Lady Slane's cottage. Kay. A ‚Äúchubby old gentleman‚Äù who is Lady Slane's youngest son. Kay lives alone with his collection of astrolabes and instruments; his only friend is Mr FitzGeorge. Edith. Lady Slane's youngest daughter (60), undisciplined and easily flustered, to her siblings' amusement and distaste. Herbert. Lady Slane's eldest boy (68), married to Mabel, member of parliament. Carrie. Lady Slane's daughter, married to Roland. Charles. Lady Slane's son, a retired general. William. Lady Slane's parsimonious son (64), married to the equally miserly Lavinia. Deborah.

Sackville-West, voiced by Lady Slane, disavowed feminism and like her long- time lover and friend Virginia Woolf, considered the issues raised were issues of human rights rather than women's rights. Adaptations In 1986 All Passion Spent was adapted into a 3 episode BBC television series starring Wendy Hiller as Lady Slane. In 2009 BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour broadcast a five-part adaptation starring Honor Blackman as Lady Slane and Mr FitzGeorge played by Alec McCowen.

Opened in 1937 for college football (and track), it was used for over three decades, through the 1968 football season. Its replacement, the Kibbie Dome, currently occupies the same site on the west end of campus. History Neale Stadium was the home field for the Idaho Vandals of the Pacific Coast Conference (and later the Big Sky) from 1937 through 1968. In addition to football, it was also used for track and field events. Approval for the stadium was granted by the board of regents in August and grading began shortly after. During construction the next spring, it was named for Mervin G. Neale, the university's president from 1930 to Its first game was the season-opener in 1937, a upset win over Oregon State on Neale Stadium was an earthen horseshoe bowl, opening to the east toward campus. The wooden grandstands were along the sidelines only, with approximately thirty rows of bench seating. The unlit stadium included the quarter-mile (402 m) cinder running track, and the white wooden scoreboard was located at the west end, on the rim of the unseated bowl. (photo) The Kibbie Dome currently occupies the site in the same east- west configuration, unorthodox for football. There were no locker room facilities at the venue, the teams dressed in the Memorial Gymnasium well to the east. Locker rooms were finally installed in 1982, with the East End Addition to the Kibbie Dome. The press box was above the south sideline's grandstand and the elevation of the playing field was above sea level. Unknown at the time, the final football season at Neale was in 1968, when it hosted two conference games, both high-scoring, close wins. Longtime rival Montana was defeated in October, and in Before Neale Stadium, football was played at MacLean Field, the large athletic field between the Mem Gym and the Shattuck Arboretum, behind (west of) the Administration Building. It was named for James Alexander MacLean, the university president from 1900 to 1913. lib.uidaho.edu ‚Äì campus buildings ‚Äì M ‚Äì accessed 2012-03-29 The baseball infield was originally in the southwest corner, with the football field set north-south, in the outfield.

At the time it was the largest-ever crowd on the Palouse and the state of Idaho. Idaho's only victory over WSU at Neale Stadium came in 1964, before another overflow crowd of The Vandals opened up a lead in the third quarter with sophomore fullback \\"Thunder Ray\\" McDonald running the ball and won convincingly; a late Cougar touchdown made the final score After a Idaho win in 1965 at Rogers Field in Pullman, a third straight win over the Cougars was nearly in hand at Neale in 1966 on a cold and sloppy afternoon, with Idaho playing ball control in the mudbath with a lead in the fourth quarter. Two Vandal fumbles led to two quick Cougar touchdowns and a WSU road win before 16,500. The 1966 game was the last UI-WSU contest in Neale Stadium and the last in the state of Idaho. All 24 games with WSU since 1967 have been played in Washington, with twenty in Pullman, three in Spokane, and one in Seattle. Condemned in 1969 The wooden grandstands of Neale Stadium were condemned for safety reasons during the summer of 1969, due to soil erosion underneath the Idaho used WSU's Rogers Field, in nearby Pullman, Washington, for their limited home schedule in 1969 (three Palouse home games), and was planning to do the same in 1970, with four home games scheduled. Idle for football for a year, a suspected arson late on Sunday, November 23, 1969, destroyed the central portion of the south grandstand and press box at Neale Stadium. Less than five months later, a similar fire occurred at Rogers Field in April 1970. Also a suspected arson, it severely damaged the south grandstand and press box of Pullman's wooden venue. This reduction in capacity forced WSU to play all of its home schedule in 1970 and 1971 at Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane, but Idaho continued to play its games at Rogers Field in 1970, using the north grandstand and temporary seating.

Weather delayed construction in the spring and Idaho's new stadium was a month behind schedule, which forced the Vandals to play their first two home games of the 1971 season away from the Palouse. The first was the season-opener at the year-old Bronco Stadium in Boise in the first-ever meeting with Boise State College; the \\"visiting\\" Broncos pulled off the upset before 16,123 on September 11 for an instant rivalry. The second was at Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane on September 25, a victory over Vandal football finally returned to campus two weeks later, when the new concrete \\"Idaho Stadium\\" opened on October 9, built on the site of Neale Stadium. With the first game on campus in nearly three years, the Vandals responded with a 40‚Äì3 victory over Idaho State. The playing field was natural grass in 1971; synthetic Tartan Turf by 3M was installed in 1972 and the stadium was fully enclosed in September 1975 to become the Kibbie Dome.

Flat networks are designed to reduce the number of routers and switches on a computer network by connecting the devices to a single switch instead of separate switches. Unlike a hierarchical network design, the network is not physically separated using different switches. The topology of a flat network is not segmented or separated into different broadcast areas by using routers. Some such networks may use network hubs or a mixture of hubs and switches, rather than switches and routers, to connect devices to each other. Generally, all devices on the network are a part of the same broadcast area. Uses Flat networks are typically used in homes or small businesses where network requirements are low. Home networks usually do not require intensive security, or separation, because the network is often used to provide multiple computers access to the Internet. In such cases, a complex network with many switches is not required. Flat networks are also generally easier to administer and maintain because less complex switches or routers are being used. Purchasing switches can be costly, so flat networks can be implemented to help reduce the amount of switches that need to be purchased. Drawbacks Flat networks provide some drawbacks, including: * Poor security ‚Äì Because traffic travels through one switch, it is not possible to segment the networks into sections and prevent users from accessing certain parts of the network. It is easier for hackers to intercept data on the network. * No redundancy ‚Äì Since there is usually one switch, or a few devices, it is possible for the switch to fail. Since there is no alternative path, the network will become inaccessible and computers may lose connectivity. * Scalability and speed ‚Äì Connecting all the devices to one central switch, either directly or through hubs, increases the potential for collisions (due to hubs), reduced speed at which the data can be transmitted and additional time for the central switch to process the data. It also scales badly and increases the chance of the network failing if excessive hubs are used and there are not enough switches to control the flow of the data through the network.

The key idea of the statement is the focus on living in response to one's own needs, without projecting onto or taking introjects from others. It also expresses the idea that it is by fulfilling their own needs that people can help others do the same and create space for genuine contact; that is, when they \\"find each other, it's beautiful.\\" Text of \\"prayer\\" Impact and legacy The prayer is well known in gestalt and psychotherapy circles, where it is generally taken as a summarizing statement of the philosophy of personal independence central to gestalt therapy. This philosophy still attracts critics, generally arguing that interpersonal relationships require real, hard work to maintain. Supporters counter that an attitude of independence does not refute this, but rather encourages people to realize that relationships need not be founded on obligation or expectation. The prayer remains popular in general culture, although the last line is sometimes omitted.Example of an individual omitting the last lineAnother example from a 1970s poster In academic discussion, it sometimes acts as a starting point for debate around issues of autonomy and interdependence. It must be added, however, that it does not characterize Gestalt therapy in general, but rather Fritz Perls' personal attitude during the time at the Esalen Institute.

Life According to Francis Peck's Desiderata Curiosa (a two-volume miscellany published 1732‚Äì1735), Richard boarded with a Latin schoolmaster until he was 15 or 16. He did not know who his real parents were, but was visited four times a year by a mysterious gentleman who paid for his upkeep. This person once took him to a \\"fine, great house\\" where Richard met a man in a \\"star and garter\\" who treated him kindly. At the age of 16, the gentleman took the boy to see King Richard III at his encampment just before the battle of Bosworth. The King informed the boy that he was his son, and told him to watch the battle from a safe vantage point. The king told the boy that, if he won, he would acknowledge him as his son. If he lost, he told the boy to forever conceal his identity. King Richard was killed in the battle, and the boy fled to London. He was apprenticed to a bricklayer, but kept up the Latin he had learned by reading during his work. Around 1546 the bricklayer, by then a very old man, was working on Eastwell Place for Sir Thomas Moyle. Moyle discovered Richard reading and, having been told his story, offered him stewardship of the house's kitchens. Richard was used to seclusion and declined the offer. Instead, he asked to build a one-room house on Moyle's estate and live there until he died. This request was granted. A building called \\"Plantagenet Cottage\\" still stands on the site of the original.EastwellPark Histoirette ‚Äì Philip G.

Re-discovery The record of Richard's burial was re-discovered in the parish registers around Michaelmas 1720. Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Winchilsea, came across it when researching his own family. He passed it on, along with family tradition of his story, to Thomas Brett, L.L.D. Brett communicated it in a letter to William Warren, L.L.D., president of Trinity Hall, who in turn passed it on to Peck.

Comprising approximately , the lands encompass Centennial Park, Moore Park and Queen's Park. The Parklands are listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register, with various components of national, state or local heritage significance. The parks are contained within the local government areas of City of Randwick, Waverley Municipal Council, and City of Sydney. The parklands are managed by the Centennial Park and Moore Park Trust, trading as the Botanic Gardens and Centennial Parklands. The Trust is administered by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The Parklands were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 March 2000. Centennial park is home to a number of wild animals including a bird life, rabbits, and foxes. It is also home to a number of equestrian schools and other domestic animal endeavours such as the Centennial Park Rabbit Retreat, a boarding facility for rabbits in the centennial park and Paddington area History Entertainment Quarter, Sydney The Parklands are constructed on lands that were traditionally in the custody of the Gadigal indigenous Australian people and are located between south-east of the Sydney central business district. The Centennial Parklands, as it stands today, represents 190 years of colonial history. The settlers had an immediate impact on the lives of the Gadi people whose clan territory takes in most of the Sydney peninsula. Gadi country extends between what is now Darling Harbour and South Head, and includes Centennial Park, Moore Park and Queens Park. Close to where Centennial Park and Moore Park are today, an area that became known as the Kangaroo Ground was recorded on a map engraved by J. Walker in 1791 or 1793. This map shows the location of what the English called the Kangaroo Ground, in the clan territories of the Gadi. The richer soils and park like atmosphere observed here by Tench and others would almost certainly have been created through regular firing by the Gadi to keep the undergrowth clear and attract kangaroos and other large game to the area for hunting. From 1882, part of the Parklands were used to house the Sydney Showground, the home of the popular Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales' annual Easter Show, attracting up to 1 million people annually to the precinct. During the 1970s, it was recognised that the Showground facilities required significant investment, there was also a large green ban which prevented the construction of a sports stadium in the park. In 1988, a decision was made to relocate the Showground facilities to land adjacent to Homebush Bay, and seven years later, it was resolved to redevelop the Moore Park Showground site into a movie production studio. The final Royal Easter Show held at Moore Park concluded during 1997. During the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and Sydney 2000 Paralympics, the parks hosted part of the road cycling events, the football, and formed part of the route for the marathons. The Parklands is home to over 15,000 trees, 124 species of native land and water birds, and 18 introduced species of land and water birds. The responsibilities of the Centennial Park and Moore Park Trust cover low-lying wetlands, ornamental lakes, pine and native forests, expanses of grass, to playing fields, a golf course, tennis and netball courts and the Entertainment Quarter at nearby Moore Park. Sydney Common Centennial Parklands, comprising Centennial Park, Moore Park and Queens Park, are part of the Second Sydney Common. As the settlement of Sydney began to develop it became necessary to set aside common land on the outskirts of the town. On 5 October 1811 Governor Macquarie proclaimed the to the south of South Head Road as the Sydney Common, for use by the public. The common land contained a vital resource in the form of a constant supply of pure water due to the natural aquifers present in the Botany Sands system. In 1820, Macquarie set aside the water reserve in the east of the Sydney Common. Between 1827 and 1838, Lachlan Water Tunnel was built providing a supply of freshwater to a terminal in Hyde Park. It remained Sydney Town's sole source of water supply until 1858, when it was supplanted by a scheme to pump water from the Botany Swamps, located further to the south. This was Sydney's second common, an area of . Lachlan Swamps and water supply The swamps, located within the Sydney Common, were naturally aquified and were an ideal source of water. In recognition of this precious resource, the Lachlan Water Reserve was founded in 1820. The Tank Stream supply of water for Sydney was inadequate and had a high level of pollutants, in 1825, the colonial government set up an enquiry into the use of the Lachlan Swamps to provide a water supply to Sydney. John Busby, a mineral surveyor, was appointed to design a water system to convey the water from the swamps to the town centre. Busby originally considered conveying the water using iron pipes, but assessed this would be too expensive. Finally he proposed a long tunnel be constructed, entirely through Crown Land. Busby's Bore The Lachlan Water Tunnel, better known as Busby's Bore, was Sydney's first piped water supply. The \\"Bore\\" or tunnel was, on average between high by wide and carried water from the Lachlan Swamps to Hyde Park. The whole length of the Tunnel was and capable of holding and 15 days' supply of water. Sydney Council took control of the Water Supply in 1842 and was responsible for the whole of the Lachlan Water Reserve. In 1861, it was decided that the whole of the Sydney Common did in fact belong to the people of Sydney. Common land was given to the authority of the Municipal Council. Moore Park was then laid out. To meet increasing demands for water, portions of the Swamp were dammed in 1872, resulting in an embankment just below what is now known as Kensington ponds, and a series of seven dams throughout the swamp. The first major development encroaching onto the Sydney Common was the siting of Victoria Barracks on the Old South Head Road (now Oxford Street) on the north east of the common. Designed in 1838 and completed ten years later, the Barracks was strategically sited between Port Jackson and Botany Bay to prevent an enemy invasion. The soldiers soon established the Military Garden, and by 1852 they had added the Garrison Cricket ground and a rifle range on land to the south of the barracks. In 1866 the Sydney Common was given to the Municipal Council of Sydney for development under the Sydney Common Improvement Bill of 1866. A public park In the second half of the nineteenth century, parts of Sydney Common were made into parkland. Lord Carrington, the Governor of NSW 1885‚Äì1890, advocated the city of Sydney should have a large recreational space in the fashion of a \\"grand park\\". Sir Henry Parkes, the premier, recognized the potential of this proposal and facilitated its realisation. Charles Moore JP, Mayor of Sydney from 1867 to 1869, worked on developing a public park for the recreation of the people of Sydney. Allotments of land alongside the South Head Road (Old South Head Road, now Oxford Street) were sold to fund the developments and soon Moore had overseen the construction of Randwick and Moore Park Roads and the creation of a public park incorporating the land around them. Charles Moore, Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, supplied the distinctive tree plantations.Conybeare Morrison & Partners, v.2, 2005. Botanist Charles Moore had visited the 1867 Exposition Universelle in Paris - in the company of his brother, David (Director of the Glasnevin Botanic Garden, Dublin) and their friend, influential ex-pat Irish garden writer William Robinson (whose \\"Gleamings from French Gardens\\" was shortly thereafter serialised in the Sydney Mail newspaper. Later in 1884, Charles Moore appointed French-trained gardener James Jones to the staff of Sydney Botanic Garden. Moore and Jones along with engineer Frederick Franklin (who had worked with horticulturist/engineer Joseph Paxton of London's 1851 Crystal Palace fame) were responsible for the layout of Sydney's Centennial Park (1886-7), a remarkable translation of the great public parks being created in Britain and east-coast America at that time.Tanner, 2010, 27 Moore Park In 1866 Sydney City Council dedicated of the north west section of Sydney Common as a recreation ground for the public to help alleviate growing pressures for outdoor activities, particularly organised sports. The area was named Moore Park in 1867 after Charles Moore JP, Mayor of Sydney City Council 1867‚Äì1869. Moore Park became the focus for major sporting events and entertainment facilities with the establishment of the Zoological Gardens in 1879, the Royal Agricultural Society Showground (which would later become the venue for Sydney's annual 'Royal Easter Show')Wentworth Courier, 2014, 22. and the first course of the Australian Golf Club in 1882. At the time of dedication, Moore Park was bounded to the south by Lachlan Estate and Randwick Racecourse, to the west by Dowling Street, to the north by Old South Head Road, and to the east by the Lachlan Water Reserve. A road lined with stone pines (Pinus pinea) marked this eastern boundary of the park and the western boundary of the water reserve. Two other roads crossed Moore Park prior to 1866; the first was known as Old Botany Road and was used by hunters and fisherman initially and later by pleasure seekers traveling to Coogee and Botany. The second road provided a western entrance to a cemetery that was located off South Dowling Street. The dedicated land encompassed the Tunnel Reserve (1827-1838), the Military Barracks and the Military Cricket Ground. Moore Park consisted of a series of gently rolling hills, three water bodies and varied scrub vegetation. Commonly known as the Sand Hills, the land was prone to erosion. By the mid 19th century, the land was degraded and barren, more a result of years of timber getting, pillaging and dumping than of inherent environmental qualities. The removal of timber in particular had led to erosion problems, so that by the early 1860s Charles Moore, the alderman, and botanist, Charles Moore, collaborated to stabilize the soils with plantings of indigenous shrubs and couch grass. The shrubs failed, but the couch grass succeeded quickly, and sparked discussion about the loss of native vegetation. Four of the sand hills were conspicuous enough to be named: Mount Steele, Mount Rennie, Constitution Hill and Mount Lang. However, in the process of transforming the common into parkland, these hills were modified greatly. Today, Mount Steele is the least altered of the four; Mt. Rennie was reconfigured as a platform for Golf Clubhouse in 1926, Mt. Lang, across from the NSW Cricket Ground, was terraced and ramped for unknown reasons and disappeared after the 1940s. The fate of Constitution Hill is not clear. The Moore Park Golf Course (established in 1926 and continuously modified) has taken advantage of and modified the gently rolling topography in establishing fairways. It is important to note that different areas of what is now Centennial Parklands came under different administrations. These differences have contributed to the individuality of the different areas within Centennial Parklands today. More developments began to be built in Moore Park. The Sydney Zoological Gardens were opened in 1879, on what is now the site of Sydney Boy's and Girl's High Schools. These were Sydney's second zoo, after one from the early 1860s in the Botanic Gardens (1862). The Zoo ceased to exist on the Moore Park site in 1916 and the animals were transferred by ferry to the newly constructed zoo site at Taronga Park (Sydney's third zoo). The establishment of the Sydney Cricket Ground, the new Royal Agricultural Society Showground and the laying out of the first course of the Australian Golf Club all took place in 1882. The Royal Agricultural Society created the Sydney Showground, home of the Royal Easter Show from 1882‚Äì1997, when it moved to Olympic Park at Homebush Bay.Lennon, 2016, 22 The population boom during the second half of the 19th Century, as well as the extension of leisure time for workers, meant public participation in the park increased. This public interest in the park led to the dedication of the Sydney Sports Ground in 1899, and the E. S. Marks Athletics Field in 1906. These developments in addition to the allotments of land sold during the 1860s have contributed to reducing the size of Moore Park from its original to today. In 1886, 65% of Sydney's population lived within an radius of the Lachlan Swamps, and this site was chosen as the location for a grand vision of public recreation. This vision was to provide a suburban drive and landscaped park for the people of Sydney. In 1914 was the first delivery of airmail in Australia. From July 16‚Äì18 French airman, Maurice Guillaux flew from the Melbourne Showground to Moore Park, Sydney Showground. A re-enactment flight was scheduled for July 2014.Newton, 2014, 32 In 2016 Moore Park celebrated 150 years since its creation, when Sydney City Council set aside part of the Lachlan Swamps area for a public park, and named Moore Park in 1867 after the then Mayor. Queens Park Queens Park, a smaller park located at the eastern edge of Centennial Park, was also created by the Centennial Celebrations Act of 1887 but was not fully developed because of drainage problems. By 1895 it contained an eleven-hole golf course, which was relocated to Botany in 1899. Since the 1930s Queens Park has been used as a sports field by Christian Brothers College, Waverley and various local sporting groups.PoM, V1: 9-10, 1997. Since then, the urban park has kept its sporting connection and now contains a number of playing fields built in the 1930s. Queens Park was reclaimed from the extensive swamp in Lachlan Reserve. A dam occupied the low-lying areas in Queens Park for most of the 1800s. The earliest phase of tree planting in Queens Park occurred in the late 1880s and early 1890s with open woodland of Moreton Bay Fig, Port Jackson figs, Monterey pine, Araucarias and Holm oak established on the higher ground. The sandstone outcrops may have already been overgrown with the locally indigenous Port Jackson figs, ferns and acacias which are now quite a striking feature of the north eastern corner the park. The coral trees and paperbarks lining the southern and western edges of the park were planted in 1923, replacing original plantings of alternating brush box and maples. The dates of other plantings in Queens Park are not clear. Queens Park has always been popular with the local community. The park has adapted to the needs of the local residents over the years but with its open spaces and panoramic views of the city skyline, it remains an important part of the parklands landscape. Centennial Park The Centenary Bill was presented to Parliament on 27 June 1887 introducing the notion of a park that would be accessible to the whole mass of people down to the very poorest class of the community. It would also transform what was regarded as an unsightly area into a region of loveliness and beauty. Centennial Park was created by the Centennial Celebrations Act 1887 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the colony. This Act, however, did not define the appropriate uses of the park. The park was established to commemorate Australia's centenary in 1888 and was opened on 26 January 1888 by Sir Henry Parkes. He stated that \\"this grand park is emphatically the people's park, and you must always take as much interest in it as if by your own hands you had planted the flowers, the park will be one of the grandest adornments to this beautiful country.\\" The newly named \\"Centennial Park\\" became the focus for the Centenary celebration preparations. Frederick Franklin, an English civil engineer, appears to have prepared the original design of the park, although historically the preservation and development of the Reserve as Centennial Park is credited to Lord Carrington, Sir Henry Parkes and Charles Moore. The layout and landscape design of the park is attributed to Charles Moore, the Director of the Botanic Gardens from 1848-96 (but no connection with Charles Moore, Mayor). Moore enlisted the labour of the unemployed to transform the native scrubland into an open expanse of public land. James Jones, head gardener of the Botanic Gardens became the General Overseer of Centennial Park and diary entries in his Day Book indicate that he played a significant part in its construction, although his desire to conserve the native flora of the area was not fulfilled. Charles Moore was charged with the task of converting 640 acres of sandy native scrub into a grand Victorian park in the space of just seven months. The park was to be designed in accordance with a plan prepared by J W Deering, District Surveyor of the Department of Lands. Whose plan was finally used remains uncertain but it appears that the principal elements of a concept developed by Frederick Augustus Franklin, an English civil engineer, were followed. Franklin had studied under Sir Joseph Paxton and the original design elements for Centennial Park bear similarities to Paxton's Birkenhead Park and the grounds of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. By the 1880s, Moore's influence on the planting and laying out of parks in Sydney was at its peak and coincided with a general boom in park creation. His preference for and extensive use of Moreton Bay Fig for public plantings in Sydney during his time as director is well documented and commented upon by many of his contemporaries. Indeed, some members of the public bemoaned his use of \\"the inevitable Moreton Bay Fig\\" in the planting of Centennial Park. James Jones, the Head Gardener of the Botanic Gardens and Overseer of the Centennial Park from 1887-1892 assisted Moore in his task. In his Day Book Jones has left a record of the Herculean effort required to clear vegetation, alter landforms, groom slopes, create open spaces and construct the Grand Drive and subsidiary roads, under the pressure of a looming opening date. Work included blasting of trenches in the sandstone to create sufficient depth for tree growth. The extensive clearing of the native vegetation had revealed just how unsuitable much of the park was for such an activity. The opening of Centennial Park on 26 January 1888 was a central event in the midst of a week of Centenary celebrations and Sir Henry Parkes declared it as the People's Park. After the opening, work continued in the park with the construction of ornamental ponds and islands. Also, in accordance with the fashions of the period monuments were added to the landscape and by 1889 there were eleven statues and two vases in the park. The Superintendent's Residence was completed in 1888, while the perimeter fence was completed in 1892. Later in the 1890s, the Ranger's Residence and Shelter Pavilion were constructed. On Australia Day 1889 a tree planting ceremony, attended by some 40,000 spectators, was officiated by Charles Moore. Guests of note included Lord & Lady Carrington, the latter of whom planted the first tree (a Cook's pine, Araucaria columnaris)) and a collection of \\"Governors (and notables)\\". Prior to this ceremony, the park was largely transformed by hundreds of unemployed men enlisted to turn swamps, scrub and rock into the grand park it would become ('In Brief', in \\"Parklands\\", Summer 2011/12, 3). One of the earliest constructed elements in the Park and the main drive around the Park, Grand Drive was originally planted in 1889 with a range of species including figs, elms, poplars and \\"pines\\" (including Norfolk Island pines and Monterey pines). William Forsyth was overseer of Centennial Park from 1892 to his death in 1911 and much of the successful horticultural development of the park during the first decade of the century has been attributed to his botanical knowledge and labours. Joseph Maiden took over the administration of the park following the retirement of Charles Moore in 1896. Maiden had his own stylistic ideas and his work had an important impact on the development of the park. He pioneered the experimentation and use of Australian native plants, introducing a more \\"tropical\\" flavour to the park's design and the introduction of more colourful species. The natural conditions of poor soil fertility, exposure and limited rainfall combined to produce a hostile environment for the park plantings. Many of the exotic trees planted by Moore withered away and Maiden noted the unsuitability of some tree species first chosen for the park. Maiden increased the areas under \\"horticultural treatment\\" and established a plant nursery to grow new plants because he believed \\"they are more likely to grow well from the start if raised in the same kind of soil as they are to be ultimately planted in.\\" By 1912 the park was producing 150,000 plants a year and these were used to create flowerbeds and shrubberies. These ornamental plantings were strategically placed around the northern shores of the main lakes and along the central roadways. They became a focus for the park and a popular destination for recreational visitors. Maiden also oversaw the use of the park for historic events, Military Reviews and public activities Working with J. H. Maiden, Forsyth introduced palms, Port Jackson fig, paperbark, acacia, and coral trees to the park. Drought and storm damage were as much of a challenge as identifying species suitable for the harsh and varied conditions in the park. The need for protection of the remnant native vegetation in the Park was frequently advocated by Forsyth in his annual reports, and experimentation with native trees, particularly eucalypts, was escalated under Forsyth's direction. In 1901, 263 eucalypts representing 18 different species were planted, and the end of the same year 1901 Forsyth reported that the number of tree species growing in the Park was 'about seventy, the total number of plants about 4,411. Of this number about 675 are planted on the Grand Drive and approaches, 321 are in Queen's Park, and the remainder distributed over the Centennial Park. The grove of turpentines planted in 1905 between the Kiosk and the Bird Sanctuary is evidence of the extensive experimentation with native trees of this period. One of Forsyth's most significant contributions was the selection of paperbarks to serve the several purposes - aesthetic, shade and windbreak. The establishment of windbreaks was essential to provide protection to the large quantity of young trees that had been planted in the park. Forsyth planted 88 of these trees in August 1896; although Forsyth did not specify locations these may be trees at the toe of the Busby Pond Embankment, and the grove adjacent to the Lily Pond. The success of this first planting led to their continued use, and in 1899 the avenue of trees lining the watercourse below the Paddington Gates was planted. A clump of Eucalyptus robusta was planted just west of these at the same time. Forsyth undertook extensive modifications to the trees planted along Grand Drive and approaches by Moore and Jones 1889. He removed elms, poplars and pines, and replaced them from 1897 onwards with a complex formal arrangement of predominantly Port Jackson figs (Ficus rubiginosa), with holm/ holly oak (Quercus ilex) and Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla). The rhythmic pattern created by the diagonal planting creates a strong landscape character in the Victorian Gardenesque tradition. This combination set the pattern for subsequent plantings in the park, particularly along the roads. In the 1890s Carrington Drive was lined with a discontinuous avenue of Port Jackson figs, and at about the same time Loch Avenue was planted with belt planting of predominantly Port Jackson figs and Norfolk Island pines to hide the Waverley tram sheds. This work was followed over the next few years by additional rows of trees lining the park roads. In 1900, figs were planted along Jervois avenue and around the same time, Parkes Drive North was planted with a row of Port Jackson figs. Centennial Park on 1 January 1901, with the Federation Pavilion at centre On 1 January 1901, Centennial Park was the site of the official ceremony to mark the federation of the Australian colonies and the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia. The ceremony was accompanied by much pomp and was attended by a vast crowd of 60,000 onlookers. At a special pavilion erected in the park, Lord Hopetoun and Edmund Barton were sworn in respectively as the first governor-general and the first Prime Minister of the new Australian nation. At the same time, the first federal cabinet was worn in. The oaths of office were administered by the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Justice of New South Wales, Sir Frederick Darley. The pavilion at which the swearing-in ceremony took place was raised on a platform consisting of a huge slab of Moruya granite with six sides to represent the original six states of the federation. Known as the Commonwealth Stone, the slab was later, in 1904, embedded in the ground as a permanent memorial to mark the exact spot where the Commonwealth came into being. The pavilion itself had been removed in 1903 and re-erected in Cabarita Park, though it was now stripped of all its original ornamentation. A new and permanent Federation Pavilion, designed by Alex Tzannes in Post-Modern style and evoking the form of a classical rotunda, was erected over the granite slab in 1988, the Bicentennial Year of European Settlement. The interior of the dome was embellished by Imants Tillers. Below the dome, a sandstone frieze runs around the outside of the structure and contains the words \\"Mammon or Millennial Eden\\". The words were taken from a sonnet called \\"Australia\\" which was written by Bernard O'Dowd in 1901. This history only relates to the federation aspects of the place. Other aspects of the place have not been considered.Pearson, et al, 1999, V.2, p.24 Palms were introduced in 1901 in Frog Hollow, and Forsyth reported that year on their success and appeal. The southern part of Frog Hollow was developed under Maiden's direction as a focus for floral displays in the Gardenesque tradition and reflected the influence and rise of the flower garden in the Federation period. As a result, In addition to Forsyth's palms, the three small promontories that jut into Busby's Pond have a number of horticultural attractions including the Rosarium, Native Plant & Flower Garden and the column monuments as well as numerous circular floral beds. A number of changes have been in this area since Maiden's time, but the overall character is attributed to his influence. From 1902, Maiden and Forsyth used palms and coral trees in linear plantings throughout the park, providing an element of contrast to the umbrageous character of the fig dominated avenues. Under Maiden's influence, an avenue comprising alternating plantings of Queen palm and Cocos Island palm was established along the Busby's Pond embankment, and an avenue of coral trees (Erythrina sp.) in Loch Avenue was mixed with occasional remnants of earlier and poorly performing planting of Port Jackson figs and holm oaks. Between 1908 and 1910 the length of Parkes Drive between Grand Drive was planted with rows of Canary Island palms (Phoenix canariensis). This is the earliest known formal avenue of Canary Island palms in Sydney and led to the widespread use of this palm throughout New South Wales. In the years immediately following, palms were used extensively in Centennial Park and Moore Park. An avenue of Senegal date palm (P. reclinata), was planted in 1912 in a diagonal pattern along the western embankment of the Randwick Pond. In 1913 more than one hundred palms were planted, of the following species and varieties: coral trees (Erythrina edulis), Indian wild date (Phoenix rupicola), African wild date (P.reclinata), dwarf Mediterranean fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), Chamaerops excelsa, Canary Island palm, jelly palm (Cocos (now Butia) yatay), Lord Howe Island (Kentia fosteriana) palms and Areca sapida. Locations for these trees are not clear, but may have included the palms lining the northern side of Dickens Drive, planted in 1915, regularly spaced row of palms to reinforce the successful 1908 palm avenue along Parkes Drive. Palms were also used as a replacement species for earlier avenue plantings; in 1916 Canary Island palms and Strelitzia replaced two avenues of poplars, a species which proved less successful in the park. Woodland plantings on the Lang Road Slopes and the York Road slopes provided a transparent enclosure for the park, but the planting along York Road, dating to 1911 is slightly denser to screen the Tram works from the park. The Department of Agriculture took charge of the administration in 1908. Following the death in 1923 of James DawesSuperintendent from 1912 and the retirement of Maiden in 1924, development of the park slowed considerably. Numerous administrative and staff changes occurred due to the Department of Agriculture taking over the administration from the Sydney Botanic Gardens. Reduced budgets resulted in a period of relatively inactivity and a general lack of documentation for works that were done. There was a large grant for unemployment relief in 1934 but there is little detail of tree planting during the 1930s. From the 1960s through the 1970s, there was a renewed interest in tree planting in Centennial Park, today several large stands of pines, including the pine plantation on the Mission Fields established s as a boundary planting and windbreak for the equestrian grounds. A grove of paperbarks (Melaleuca quinquenervia), planted s on a filled former drainage line in the Mission Fields demonstrates the continued influence of Maiden's planting principles. A grove of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) planted on the Parade Ground on Arbor Day, 1967 demonstrates the continuing tradition of Arbor Day and Wattle Day celebrations. A grove of spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) near the Woollahra Gates, mostly planted since the late 1960s represents the revival of experimentation with native species in the Centennial Park, a result of the influence of Ron Selkeld, Park Superintendent in 1965. This hill top area is exposed to southerly winds where Spotted Gum had grown vigorously but mugga ironbark planted (Eucalyptus leucoxylon) earlier did not thrive. Clumps of mainly scribbly gum were planted on the sandstone outcrops from the 1960s. The Scribbly Gums grouped around the outcrops provide a wild and picturesque effect and contrast with the more formal plantings that dominate the avenues in the parklands. At about the same time, some three hundred flooded gum trees (Euc.grandis) were planted out on the hillside to the south of Broom Avenue. In 1968, an article in The Land newspaper highlighted the need to find species suitable for the \\"light fine soil\\" of Centennial Park. The article stressed the value of the Park as \\"a great testing ground\\" particularly for native species for coastal planting. In 1984, the Centennial Park & Moore Park Trust was appointed to administer all of Centennial Park and Queens Park. In 1990 the Centennial Park & Moore Park Trust (Trust) was appointed to administer Moore Park, including the Moore Park Golf course and in 1992 the E.S. Marks Field. The Trust administers Centennial Parklands in accordance with the Centennial Park and Moore Park Trust Act 1983. Renewal throughout the 1990s included the involvement of John Lennis (1952-2015) Aboriginal \\"bush tutor\\" with the Guriwal Aboriginal Corporation at La Perouse, then Aboriginal Education Officer with the Royal Botanic Gardens & Domain Trust. He advised on establishing the native plantings and walks at Ash Paddock and Lachlan Swamps. He also was responsible for the Cadi Jam Ora - First Encounters Garden in the Royal Botanic Garden.Robertson, 2015. Special events The provision of grand open spaces has tended to invite military parades and reviews throughout the history of Sydney. The first such events were held on the parade ground in the (Hyde Park) barracks square. As other preferable venues became available these events moved; first to the Domain, then Moore Park and ultimately Centennial Park. Large public displays were held on the Queens Birthday, other public holidays and on significant anniversaries such as Jubilees and Centenaries. In 1888, the Long Meadow in Centennial Park was used for the annual Military Review. In 1908, Australian troops participated in a review to celebrate the \\"Great White Fleet\\" visit. A celebration was held in 1954 when Queen Elizabeth visited Centennial Park. The Royal Agricultural Society was allowed to use the park at show time in 1865. The exhibitions were very popular, and in December 1887 one Sydney resident wrote a letter to the editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, saying that the only celebration he was looking forward to was the Agriculture Society (of NSW)'s exhibition planned for 26 January 1888. The Showground was a major attraction for generations of Australians. The Parklands has always provided a venue for special events including conventions, exhibitions, film productions, sporting events, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras as well as the Royal Easter Show. In recent years Centennial Park has developed its capacity to hold special events. Recently the parklands have played host to a number of events such as Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Big Bold and Brassy, Hermes International Show jumping and Concert for Life. The Parklands was also an open-air venue for the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games road cycling and marathon events. In 2007 the Rugby Centre for Excellence and in 2008 the Sports Medicine Clinic were constructed in Moore Park.Greenwich, 2016, 3. In 2013 the park celebrated its 125th anniversary with various celebrations. A ten-day light garden in January from the Paddington Gates down to Centennial Parklands Dining highlighted that area, a tree planting on Australia Day, development of the Park's inaugural master plan and construction of the first ever children's garden occurred throughout the year. Executive officer Peter Hadfield called on the state and federal governments to commit $20m to establish a future fund for the park.Wentworth Courier, 2012, 9. Rebecca Giles, governor of the Centennial Parklands Foundation, notes rising private philanthropy stepping into the budget gap left by a withdrawing NSW Government. Examples of New York's Central Park's Conservancy were cited. Since January Ms Giles cited a record $1.5m grant for a children's play garden from the Ian Potter Foundation; $500,000 for a labyrinth project, $100,000 from Tiffany & Co. to improve the Woollahra gates and $45,000 for disabled access improvements at Moore Park Golf Course. Centennial Park The Centennial Park, with , is the largest of the three parks that make up the Centennial Parklands. Centennial Park comprises of open space and lightly wooded grounds located within the City of Randwick. It was originally swampland, known as Lachlan Swamps. Centennial Park is one of Australia's most famous parks and is listed on the Register of the National Estate; and is a grand park in the Victorian period tradition featuring formal gardens, ponds, grand avenues, statues, historic buildings and sporting fields. Centennial Park Labyrinth Sydney's first public stone labyrinth was officially opened on 15 September 2014. It cost more than 500,000 and five months to build. It is an eleven circuit sandstone labyrinth, designed based on the medieval labyrinth in Chartres Cathedral, France. History Centennial Park was set aside by Governor Macquarie in 1811 and was developed as water reserve and common grazing land. Autumn leaves observed in Centennial Park, Sydney. Russian cannon from the Crimean War The government began plans for a celebratory park in 1887 and passed an Act of Parliament in the following year. Some of the grandiose plans for the area, such as a museum and a national convention building, never eventuated. Centennial Park was dedicated by Governor Lord Carrington, on Australia Day on 26 January 1888 to celebrate the first 100 years of European settlement in Australia and described by him as 'emphatically the people's park'. The Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun dedicated the park 'to the people of New South Wales forever'. The land was originally set aside by Governor Lachlan Macquarie for grazing and watering stock. The ponds to the south, known as Lachlan Swamps, were named in his honour and were the chief water supply for Sydney from 1830 to 1880. Water was carried to Hyde Park along a tunnel called Busby's Bore, after its designer John Busby (1765‚Äì1857). The tunnel served the needs of Sydney until the Nepean scheme made it redundant in the 1880s. In 1851, it was a scene of a duel between the first Premier of New South Wales, Stuart Donaldson, and the Surveyor-General, Thomas Mitchell. Both men survived to fulfil their duties. In more recent times, the park has had its share of bad news and publicity. On 7 February 1986, Sallie-Anne Huckstepp was found drowned in the Busby Pond. It was thought that she had been murdered by a well-known Sydney criminal, Neddy Smith, but he was not convicted. The Sydney Morning Herald described her as a \\"32-year-old gangster's moll, heroin addict and prostitute who mingled with Sydney's most notorious criminals and blew the whistle on crooked cops.\\" Near Oxford Street is a space known as Cannon Triangle, which includes a statue called \\"We Won\\" and two cannon. The cannon were manufactured in Russia and used in the Crimean War. They were captured by British Forces after the fall of Sevastopol. A number of them were given to various cities that had made a contribution to the war effort, with the result that two of them found their way to Centennial Park. They have been in the park since 1920.  Federation Pavilion  Federation Pavilion The Federation Pavilion, which encloses the Commonwealth Stone (1901), is significant as the site of the official ceremony to mark the Federation of Australia and the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901.Federation Monument, Centennial Park, NSW Profile The Federation Pavilion, designed by Alexander Tzannes, was erected around the 'Commonwealth Stone' as a permanent monument to Federation, in the Bicentennial Year of European Settlement in 1988. An inscription around the pavilion is from a poem by Bernard O'Dowd, and reads: \\"Mammon or millennial Eden\\". The building was renovated and plaques were added to celebrate the Centenary of the Federation of Australia on 1 January 2001. The Commonwealth Stone is made of sandstone, and it is almost the only remnant of the original pavilion used by Lord Hopetoun. Most of the structure rotted, being made of plaster of Paris; the base survived and is now located in Cabarita Park. Its remains are heritage- listed under the name \\"Federation Pavilion\\".  Grand Drive  Ranger's cottage designed by Walter Liberty Vernon Grand Drive is the circular main road through the park. It runs for and was part of the marathons course used in the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. The drive is separated into five concentric circles, with the outer track used for cycling or rollerblading, fourth largest for car driving, third for car parking and many trees, the second is a paved pathway for walking, also used for running, the smallest being a dirt track for horseriding. In March 2012, Centennial Parklands management issued a proposal for traffic calming measures at one of four identified blackspots on Grand Drive. The proposal caused the ire of cyclist groups who staged a mass protest, claiming that the proposed measures would make the park more dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians. Public submissions into the proposal were invited and Centennial Parklands management, together with community consultative representatives, are currently reviewing.  McKay Oval  Flying fox in Lachlan Swamp Located in the most western area of the park, McKay Oval is used as the home ground of Sydney Boys High School for rugby union, soccer and cricket matches, in the Great Public Schools Competition. The main oval is currently surrounded by small white fence, which is also the boundary for cricket games, though spectators for the winter sports are allowed inside this boundary and are allowed to sit very close to the field, around . Built adjacent is the Fairland Pavilion, the hosting area for various lunches and afternoon teas, also the location of the canteen, changerooms, scoreboard, first aid, and storerooms for the bulk of the sporting equipment. Wildlife Centennial Park has a wide variety of wildlife that makes its home in the park or uses it frequently. The range includes pelicans, black swans, mallard ducks, White ducks, purple swamphens, Common moorhens, coots, Toulouse geese, Emden geese, turtles and eels, plus European carp that were introduced into the park's ponds and are now regarded as a pest. There is also a colony of flying foxes in the Lachlan Swamp (including the grey-headed flying fox), which began roosting there in 2010. Moore Park Moore Park is a large urban park comprising of open spaces and playing fields, including the ES Marks Athletics Field, an 18-hole public golf course and golf driving range, tennis courts and netball courts. The park is also used as a venue for circuses and other outdoor events. The adjoining Sydney Football and Sydney Cricket stadia are managed by the Sydney Cricket & Sports Ground Trust. The Albert 'Tibby' Cotter pedestrian bridge with concrete helical approach ramps across Anzac Parade connects Moore Park (west) with Kippax Lakes and Moore Park (east). A section of the heritage-listed Busby's Bore is located adjacent to Kippax Lakes and run's underneath sections of Moore Park. History The parkland located south of Paddington was named after Charles Moore, Mayor of Sydney from 1867‚Äì69, who fought for the land to be dedicated as a leisure area for the people of Sydney and suburbs. The land was part of originally set aside by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810 for grazing and watering stock. Sydney's first zoo was established here in 1879 on of land known as Billygoat Swamp. The zoological gardens covered by 1906 but moved to Bradley's Head at the site now known as Taronga in 1917. It was replaced by Sydney Girls High School, which opened on this site in 1921. Students were transferred from Elizabeth Street, which was the site of the David Jones Department Store. Sydney Boys High School opened in 1928 on the remaining zoo land. An infamous pack rape crime occurred in the park, leading to the 1886 Mount Rennie rape case. Nine men were sentenced to death and four were hanged despite controversy. Location on the rise known as Mount Rennie is the heritage-listed Moore Park Golf House that was opened on 19 June 1926. The Golf House is a two-storey brick building with tiled roof and features a restaurant and bar with views of the golf course and a 150-seat function centre with views towards the city. Constructed in 1909 in the park's northwestern corner is a rotunda, designed by the New South Wales Government Architect, that fell into disrepair by 1929 and was restored in 2004. A sandstone dwelling constructed in 1860 on the corner of Anzac Parade and Alison Road served as a road toll house up until 1877 and is the only surviving metropolitan toll house and the only two-storey toll house. Road tolls were collected from travellers journeying between Sydney and or Randwick Racecourse. Queen's Park Queen's Park is a urban park set in a natural amphitheatre at the foot of dramatic sandstone cliffs, with panoramic views, that forms part of the Centennial Parklands. It was dedicated with Centennial Park in 1888 as part of the centenary celebrations of European settlement in Australia through the enactment of the Centennial Celebrations Act 1887. Surrounded to the north by the suburb of , the park was originally part of the Sydney Common and later the Lachlan Swamps Water Reserve. Numerous playing fields are located on the southern and western flatter sections of the park. It has been used for sports fields since 1938. Moriah College, which is located on the park's western boundary, also uses the park for their PDHPE lessons and other schools in Sydney also use the park. The Centennial Park and Moore Park Trust undertook major renovations of Queen's Park in 2009 to improve the quality of the playing fields which are used daily. The Trust also completed a major renovation of the popular children's playground in 2009, and developed a shared cycleway to link the eastern suburbs cycle network with Centennial Park.  Heritage listing  As at 25 September 2008, Centennial Parklands is a unique place of exceptional National, State and Local heritage significance. It is a grand, linked open space of largely nineteenth-century landscape design intended for social and physical activity. The Parklands has developed at the head of the Botany Bay catchment in an area originally part of the territory of the Gadi people on lands designated in 1811 as the Sydney Common. The Parklands retains evidence of the original landforms and plays a vital role in sustaining natural processes and biological diversity on a scale that is rare in the inner urban environment. The Parklands has national significance as the place of the inauguration of the nation, the creation of a People's Park, events, persons and monuments of national importance. The place also has strong associations with convict heritage, pathways and transportation routes, water supply, horticultural and agricultural experimentation, nature conservation, military use, and a diversity of sport, recreation and cultures. Summary of Natural Heritage Centennial Parklands retains rare evidence of the original geodiversity, biodiversity, and ecosystems of the area known today as the eastern suburbs of Sydney. The natural basin in which the Parklands is situated retains its hydrological and ecological function as the head of the Botany Bay catchment. The waterbodies and vegetation in the Parklands continue to provide rare habitat for a wide diversity of indigenous flora and fauna within a highly urbanised area. The Parklands provides habitat for rare and threatened species and contains remnants of an endangered ecological community, Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, which covered much of the area prior to European contact. The natural significance of the Parklands underpins its value to current and future generations and to the regional environment. Summary of Indigenous Heritage Today's Parklands forms a part of a complex of Indigenous places used as a natural resource for social, ceremonial and subsistence purposes in the pre-colonial and post-contact periods. The traditional Gadigal cultural landscape included a detailed knowledge of the land and resources of today's Parklands, which allowed the Gadi people as custodians to manage them and look after them properly. In return the land looked after the Gadi. The springs, wetlands and remnant vegetation that can still be found in the Parklands today continue to represent an important biological resource which would have been a useful source of fresh water, plants and animals through the generations. It is therefore probable that the Gadi people used the area for camping, food collecting and other activities in the pre-colonial period. Known associations during the post-contact era include camping and food collecting visits, employment, military activities, sport, cultural events and leisure. The maintenance of ongoing spiritual and other associations with Country continues to be important to Indigenous Australians who wish to care for this place as a cultural landscape. Summary of Cultural Heritage Centennial Parklands is highly valued for its space, scale, beauty and grandeur and for the rarity and diversity of its Natural, Indigenous and Cultural heritage. For many individuals, groups and the community as a whole, Centennial Parklands is a cultural landscape that continues to play an important and vital role in personal and social histories. The place retains significant associations with the development of the early colony of NSW, the establishment and design of parks and gardens for the public good, and prominent events. These include the Centenary and Bicentenary of the establishment of the NSW colony, inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the 2000 Olympic Games, the Paralympics and the Centenary of Federation celebrations in 2001. Centennial Parklands is highly significant for its leisure and sporting heritage. The individual parks that make up the Parklands were specifically established to cater for public recreation and have been an important social and recreational resource for over a century. Centennial Parklands now receives millions of visits annually, attracting people from surrounding residential areas, the wider Sydney region and beyond. The Parklands provides a unique area of open space that supports a diversity of activities that are rare in an inner urban area. Centennial Park, Moore Park, Queens Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 March 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Centennial Park is historically significant as part of the site of the second Sydney Common and public open space proclaimed by Governor Lachlan Macquarie on 5 October 1811. It is the site of Sydney's second and third water supply, Busby Bore and the Lachlan Water Reserve. It is the site of Sydney's first public suburban drive - the Grand Drive. It is the first designed suburban park, based on the English model of integrated suburban residential development and recreational open space. The Park provided the setting for the following prominent events: The Centenary Celebrations, 1888; The Annual Military Review; the Commonwealth Swearing-in Ceremony 1901; the American Fleet Review 1908; mourning for the death of King Edward 1910; Peace Celebrations and Thanksgiving Service 1918; Sesqui-Centenary Celebrations 1938; Federation Jubilee 1951; Federation Pavilion dedication 1988; Bi-Centenary Celebrations 1988. The most significant periods in the history of the park are: pre-European, natural environment pre-1788; Lachlan Water Reserve 1811‚Äì1887; Centennial Park 1888‚Äì1930, 1984‚Äìpresent [1990].Burton 1990 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Centennial Park is a designed environment that, after 100 years, still retains the unity and continuity of its designed elements. Aesthetically it combines contrasting landscape types with spatial diversity that, together with a surrounding built environment that complements the scale of the Park while providing minimal visual intrusion, works together to provide a harmony of scale. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Centennial park, designed as a People's Park, has provided an important social venue for meetings of a range of community groups, commemorative events, sporting events, military venues, concerts and general public recreation. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Centennial Park has been the site of horticultural experimentation, particularly with grass species and native tree species. It has also been the site of conservation of indigenous bird species and is the location of indigenous plant species representative of the ecology of the Botany sands system.

Midas is an Elizabethan era stage play, a comedy written by John Lyly. It is arguably the most overtly and extensively allegorical of Lyly's allegorical plays.  Performance and production  Midas was entered into the Stationers' Register on 4 October 1591; it was first published in 1592 in a quarto printed by Thomas Scarlet for Joan Broome. She was the widow of William Broome, the bookseller who issued reprints of Lyly's Campaspe and Sapho and Phao in 1591; the widow Broome herself published the first editions of Lyly's Endymion (1591) and Gallathea (1592). Midas was probably acted by the Children of Paul's, Lyly's regular company through most of his playwriting career. The title page of the first edition states that the play was performed at Court on Twelfth Night, probably on 6 January 1590.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 416. John Dover Wilson proposed that Lyly himself may have played the role of Midas;John Dover Wilson, John Lyly, Cambridge, Macmillan and Bowes, 1905; p. 134. but this is a speculation unsupported by evidence. \\"Obviously\\"Richard Warwick Bond, ed., The Complete Works of John Lyly, Oxford, Claredon Press, 1902; Vol. 3, p. 110. the play was written after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The play also features an allusion to the English Armada of 1589; the authorship of Midas must date from the 1588‚Äì89 period. The student theatre ensemble of Stuart Hall School, located in Staunton, Virginia, staged a production of Midas in 2010 directed by Theatre Programme Director, Brett Sullivan Santry. The performers, who ranged in age from eleven to seventeen, rehearsed and performed under the tenets of Original staging practices from the Elizabethan period. Given the play‚Äôs extremely limited modern production history, the probability exists that the Stuart Hall production marked the first time the play was staged in North America.  Synopsis  Lyly based his play on the treatment of the Midas story given in Book xi of the Metamorphoses of Ovid; he departs from Ovid's version mainly to strengthen the allegorical aspects of the play (see below). He exploits both aspects of the Midas legend in classical mythology ‚Äî the golden touch and the ass's ears. Bacchus, the god of wine, rewards the hospitality of Midas, king of Phrygia, by offering him anything he desires. The king's three courtiers, Eristus, Martius, and Mellicrates, variously advise him to choose rewards that center on love, war, and wealth; Midas accepts the advice of Mellicrates and asks that everything he touches turn to gold. (In the classic legend, Midas is motivated simply by greed; in Lyly's play, Midas wants gold partly to finance his planned invasion of the island of Lesbos, an idea that winds throughout the play.) In the play as in the myth, Midas's misfortunes with his golden touch follow; his clothes, food, wine, and even his beard all turn to gold. Midas eventually cures himself by taking the advice of Bacchus and bathing in the river Pactolus, which becomes gold-producing as a result. In the second phase of the king's adventures, Midas, hunting in a wood on Mount Tmolus, encounters Apollo and Pan, who are preparing to engage in a musical competition. Midas thrusts himself into the role of judge, and decides in favor of Pan; Apollo responds by giving the king the ears of an ass. Midas conceals his affliction at first, but the news passes from nymphs to shepherds, and is eventually whispered by reeds to all the world. Midas's sensible daughter Sophronia (a Lylian addition) appeals to Apollo's oracle at Delphi for guidance. Midas goes to Delphi, admits his foolishness and expresses repentance; his auricular affliction is cured, and a newly humbled Midas renounces his plans for conquest, especially against the stalwart islanders of Lesbos. The play has a more overtly comic subplot focused on Motto, Midas's barber. Motto comes into possession of Midas's golden beard after removing it from the king's face; but the beard is stolen from him by the mischievous pages that are a standard feature of Lyly's drama. Motto recovers the beard by curing a case of toothache (barbers doubled as dentists in Lyly's era, and for long before and after). But the pages exploit Motto's role in spreading the news about the king's ass-ears: they accuse him of treason, and demand and obtain the beard as the price of their silence.  Allegory  It is universally recognized that Lyly's Midas represents the fabulously wealthy Philip II of Spain, while the island of Lesbos that he longs to conquer is Elizabeth's England. Nicholas John Halpin, in his Oberon's Vision (1834), offered a complex and detailed interpretation of the fine points of Lyly's allegory, in which the Pactolus is the Tagus River in Portugal; the barber Motto is Philip II's secretary Antonio P√©rez, who was banished for betraying royal secrets; Martius is the Duke of Medina Sedonia, while Mellicrates is the Duke of Alva; Eristus is Ruy Gomez de Libra; and Sophronia is Philip's daughter Isabella Clara Eugenia, among various other identifications. Critics rarely go so far as to embrace all of Halpin's points, though most concede some of the more obvious, like Sophronia/Isabella.Bond, Vol. 3, pp. 109-10.

Ideal tasks are different from real tasks. They are ideals in the Platonic sense of a circle being an ideal whereas a drawn circle is flawed and real. The study of theoretically best or ‚Äúmathematically ideal‚Äù tasks (Green & Swets, 1966), has been the basis of the branch of stimulus control in psychology called Psychophysics as well as being part of Artificial Intelligence (e. g. Goel & Chandrasekaran, 1992). Such studies include the instantiation of such ideal tasks in the real world. The notion of the ideal task has also played an important role in information theory. Tasks are defined as sequences of contingencies, each presenting stimuli and requiring an action or a sequence of actions to occur in some non- arbitrary fashion. These contingencies may not only provide stimuli that require the discrimination of relations among actions and events but among task actions themselves. Again, Task actions, E, are actions that are required to complete tasks. Properties of tasks (usually the stimuli, or the relationship among stimuli and actions) are varied, and responses to them can be measured and analyzed. References * Goel, A., & Chandrasekaran, B.

Those files used to be (and, to a moderate extent, still are) post-processed by a tool called dvips, which converted those DVI files into PostScript files, which are understood by many printers. Some older versions of dvips with embedded bitmapped fonts, which represented letters and symbols as pictures at a fixed resolution (for instance, at 300 dpi). When such files are printed on newer devices (some with resolution of 1200 dpi), the letters of the files that have bitmapped fonts display a remarkably low quality, with jagged lines on curves and diagonals. One solution to this problem is to substitute the bitmapped fonts with scalable fonts (known among PostScript users as Type 1 fonts). To remedy this problem of low quality printing, one can use Heiko Oberdiek's utility called pkfix. The input of pkfix is a PostScript file generated by dvips (with versions at 5.58 or newerDocumentation of pkfix on CTAN.) and its output is another PostScript file, this time, with the bitmapped fonts substituted by scalable fonts (if possible). Technically speaking, pkfix is a Perl script which searches the PostScript file for comments on bitmapped PK fonts (introduced by relatively recent dvips versions), and replaces them with the corresponding Type 1 fonts. Of course, a simpler solution to this problem would be to reprocess the LaTeX/TeX files with recent tools and fonts, but, in most cases, the person that has the given PostScript file isn't the author of the document and doesn't have access to the source files (or, worse, the source files may have been lost during the times).

After her mother was killed in a recent hit-and-run, Amy received a locked metal box containing more than a quarter of a million dollars in cash‚Äîand a letter from her mother that explained only that the money came from her father. The mystery of Amy's mother's identity rivals that of her father's. Plot summary Lily Rowan has employed Amy Denovo, a recent Smith graduate, to assist her in collecting material about her father for a book. After a brief acquaintance with Archie Goodwin, Amy intercepts him one afternoon in the lobby of Lily's building for a \\"very personal\\" request: she has never known her own father, and asks Archie to help her find out who he is, or was. She believes her mother took the name Denovo‚Äî\\"de novo,\\" Latin for \\"anew,\\" \\"afresh\\"‚Äîbecause she began a new life after Amy was born. She can't be certain because Elinor Denovo was killed three months before, in a hit-and-run. Amy is curious about her mother, but she must know about her father, and the inquiry must be kept secret. Although he is intrigued, Archie turns Amy down. Nero Wolfe charges high fees, and the $2,000 Amy has in the bank would not begin to cover what promises to be a long and expensive job. The next afternoon, Amy arrives at the brownstone with $20,000 in hundred-dollar bills ‚Äî a retainer. She says that her mother's death has brought to light the fact that Elinor Denovo had received $1,000 a month since Amy was born, a total of $264,000, and that this money is from Amy's father. Once Archie confirms that the letter is authentic, he and Wolfe accept Amy as a client in good standing. Argosy magazine (November 1968) Archie visits the Madison Avenue office of Raymond Thorne Productions, Elinor's employer for more than 20 years and the only information Amy knows about her mother. He tells Thorne that Amy is convinced that her mother was deliberately killed and has hired Nero Wolfe to find the murderer. Thorne, too, knows nothing of Elinor life before she began working for him, and isn't surprised there are no photographs in her apartment, because Elinor could never be persuaded to have one taken, not even for professional purposes. But Thorne has two, captured by accident and without her knowledge, and he gives copies to Archie. Archie traces the checks Elinor received every month to the Seaboard Bank and Trust Company. Wolfe imposes upon the good will of Avery Ballou, who had paid Wolfe well for rescuing him from a predicament a year and a half before and who is on Seaboard's board of directors. Ballou soon tells him that the checks were drawn by Cyrus M. Jarrett, who was president of Seaboard and 54 years old when Amy was born. Jarrett has a daughter living in Europe, and a son, Eugene, age 43. Ballou arranges for Archie to have lunch with Bert McCray, a vice president at Seaboard who once had been Jarrett's prot√©g√©. McCray recognizes the photographs of Elinor Denovo, whose name was Carlotta Vaughn when they both worked for Jarrett. Wolfe sends Orrie Cather to Washington, D.C., to check on Jarrett and sends Saul Panzer and Fred Durkin to turn up information on Carlotta Vaughn, while Archie follows two promising leads that end in humiliation. Wolfe drafts a display ad to run in all of the New York papers, offering a $500 reward for information about the whereabouts of Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo, between April and October 1944. After placing the ads, Archie leaves to spend the weekend at Lily's place in the country, during which he is annoyed by the presence of Floyd Vance, an obnoxious press agent. By Thursday afternoon, few leads have been turned up by the newspaper ad and no useful information has come in. Wolfe, who has shown the situation's desperation by exceeding his quota of beer, declares that he has decided to assume that Amy's father killed her mother, since a three-month-old murder will be easier to solve than a 22-year-old mystery. They begin by speaking to Raymond Thorne. During a long, rambling interview that extends into the wee hours, Thorne gives a key piece of information: days before Elinor's murder, Vance had tried to see her at work and had been ejected. Archie realizes that Vance matches the description, provided by a waiter in response to the ad, of Elinor's 1944 dining companion. The next morning, Wolfe summons Saul to work with Archie on an approach on Vance. Archie arranges for Lily to play bodyguard to Amy, since it is now a certainty that Elinor Denovo was murdered and she may be next. Archie makes contact with Dorothy Sebar, who lived in the same building where Vance held an office in 1944; she confirms that Carlotta Vaughn worked for Vance during that summer. Archie invites Vance to Wolfe's office for an interview. Vance denies having impregnated Carlotta and leaves, after which Archie and Saul collect all the items he touched and box them for the police. Archie delivers them the next morning; hours later, Inspector Cramer and Sergeant Stebbins come to Wolfe's office, having matched Vance's prints to those taken from a cigar case in the car that killed Elinor. Wolfe waits until the police reveal Vance's motive for the murder, then calls Jarrett to the office. With Amy watching in secret, Wolfe confronts Cyrus M. Jarrett, who confirms the full truth: Floyd Vance is Amy's father, and Jarrett knew this because he is Vance's father. Wolfe demands from Jarrett, for his responsibility in placing two weeks of strain on Amy, a $50,000 check in payment of services as replacement for Amy's retainer. He receives that check several months later, three days after Vance is convicted of first-degree murder. The unfamiliar word Nero Wolfe's erudite vocabulary is one of the hallmarks of the character. The Father Hunt includes these examples: * \\"Cogitable\\", a word deemed \\"rare\\" by Oxford Dictionaries, appears in chapter 5, in Archie's reply to a question about whether Mrs. Denovo's death was premeditated murder: \\"Mr. Wolfe would say it's 'cogitable.'

It examines the flaws of current health care systems and proposes reforms for the American health care system. In doing so it examines twenty common assumptions about government involvement in health care systems which they argue are myths. The book continues on to discuss the economics and politics behind health care in the United States, and proposes market based reforms.NCPA: Lives at Risk: Single-Payer National Health Insurance Around the World  Introduction  It begins by examining how three fundamental facts about health care systems. # The potential exists to spend the entire US GDP on health care in useful ways. # As time goes on, Americans desire to spend more of their income on health care. # The US has suppressed normal market forces in dealing with 1 and 2. The authors contend that Americans could potentially spend their entire GDP on medical testing alone. Lives at Risk page 2 They further explain that as people become older and wealthier, they naturally spend more of their money on health care. Lives at Risk page 6 They explain how the suppression of normal market forces, in conjunction with the first two facts, has created the problems currently faced with health care in the United States and abroad.  Problems with national systems  The authors examine whether countries other than the United States have been able to solve the problems listed above. Since the stated goals of national health insurance are often to make health care available based on need rather than ability to pay, they state that # national health care systems lead to rationing in the form of waiting lists # access to health care is correlated with income under national systems # too much money is spent on the healthy, while the most critically sick are denied access to specialized care and technology They claim that this situation is the natural result of putting politicians in charge of health care, as the policies tend to maximize the number of voters serviced rather than achieving the goals of equality. Lives at Risk page 10  Trends in national systems  The authors explain that most European countries with a national health care system have introduced market based reforms and relied on the private sector to reduce costs and increase the availability and effectiveness of health care. Some examples include # the NHS has begun treating patients in private hospitals and contracting with private health care providers # the Canadian health care system spends over a billion dollars annually on U.S. medical care # Sweden has introduced reforms to allow more than forty percent of all heal care services to be delivered privately  Goals of the book  The authors state that the goal of the book is to dispel myths about health care as delivered in countries with national health insurance. Further, they desired to explain why the American system is bad, why the nationalized systems are worse, and how to reform the American system without making the same mistake made by many other countries.  Myths about government health care   Right to health care  According to the book, citizens in countries with national health care systems do not have an entitlement to health care. (See also Accuracy below). The book claims that the only country in the world that provides an entitlement to any health care service is the United States, whose citizens are legally entitled to kidney dialysis treatment; that citizens of other countries are not entitled to any particular treatment; and that while many citizens under national health care systems are allowed to wait in line for services, they are not even entitled to hold a place in line, as other patients may jump the queue. All these claims are highly dubious and are not sustantiable because clearly there are very many cases where all citizens in other countries with national health care systems that are entitled to a wide range of health care services (not just dialysis). The UK has many examples of guaranteed maximum wait times (e.g. 2 weeks to see a specialist for a suspected cancer for example).  Equality under national systems  The book claims that the elderly, minorities, and rural areas are all discriminated against in national systems and that the systems do not make care available based on need. The British National Health Service was championed in 1950s as a way to end inequalities in health care. After thirty years the Black Report found inequality had not changed, and after fifty years the Acheson Report found that it had widened.Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health Acheson Report (London Stationery Office, 1998) Furthermore, health care quality in different parts of Britain varies greatly, with higher quality care being found in the wealthier areas.\\"Geographic Variations in Health,\\" UK Office for National Statistics, Decennial Supplement 16, 2001 Large geographic disparity in health care has been observed in Canada as well, where the amount of money spent on urban patients was many times larger than that spent on rural patients.Arminee Kazanjian et al., \\"Fee Practice Medical Expenditures per Capita and Full-Time-Equivalent Physicians in British Columbia, 1993-1994,\\" University of British Columbia, 1995 High- profile Canadian patients such as politicians and the wealthy enjoy more frequent services, shorter waiting times, and greater choice in specialists.Sheryl Dunlop, Peter C. Coyte and Warren McIsaac, \\"Socio-Economic Status and Utilisation of Physicians' Services: Results from the Canadian National Population Health Survey,\\" Social Science and Medicine 51, no. 1 (July 2000): 1-11 The book claims that national health care systems make treatment available on the basis of need rather than ability to pay is also discussed as a myth. While British NHS gives preferential treatment to paying customers, such as foreigners, many Britons opt to pay out of pocket for private services in order to avoid waiting for public health care.NHS Patients Opt for Private Surgery BBC News, January 15, 2002  Quality of health care  Priorities do not go towards having the greatest impact on health. Outcomes of national systems are of lower quality. Modern technology is less available under national systems. Prescription drugs are less available under national systems. The authors contend that the United States' high infant mortality and mediocre life expectancy are not indicative of the quality of health care. In the latter case, they note that while Japan has a longer life expectancy, Japanese Americans enjoy the same long life expectancy. Similarly, infant mortality among Asians is low in Asian countries and in the US.\\"Infant Mortality Statistics from the 1997 Period: Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set,\\" National Vital Statistics Reports 47, no. 23 (July 30, 1999) The United States has a better survival rate for prostate cancer and breast cancer than most industrialized countries.Gerard F. Anderson and Peter S. Hussey, \\"Multinational Comparisons of Health Systems Data, 2000,\\" Commonwealth Fund, October 2000. The authors point out that access to modern medical technology is better in the United States than in countries with national health care systems.Uwe Reinhardt, Peter S. Hussey and Gerard F. Anderson, \\"Cross-National Comparisons of Health Systems Using OECD Data, 1999,\\" Health Affairs 21, no. 3 (May/June 2002): 169-81, Exhibit 5.  Costs and efficiency  Administrative costs, costs to patients, and unnecessary care go up while efficiency goes down. Citizens under national health care system do not get more preventative care than Americans. The overhead of managed care systems in the US is less than that of national systems. A national system would not improve America's international competitiveness in industry. Costs of prescription drugs are comparable in national systems and in the US.  Public opinion  Public opinion of national health care has decreased rapidly since its inception in various countries.  Reform  Large organizations such as car manufacturers, cities, or states do not need federal action to implement single payer systems.  Proposed reforms for the American health care system  The proposal to reform the American health care system is to restructure the social safety net so that it rewards people who take care of their own health care needs while providing disincentives for those who rely on the safety net. The goal is to make it so that the economic impact of a person's choice to take care of themselves or to use the safety net is economically neutral to the rest of society.

The lumbar portion of the sympathetic trunk typically has 4 lumbar ganglia. The lumbar splanchnic nerves arise from the ganglia here, and contribute sympathetic efferent fibers to the nearby plexuses. The first two lumbar ganglia have both white and gray rami communicates. Function Paravertebral ganglia are divided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral ganglia. Each controls different glands and muscle groups since each muscle and gland receives input from postganglionic neurons that originated from different levels of paravertebral ganglia. The lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk contains four interconnected ganglia. Superiorly, it is continuous with thoracic sympathetic ganglion and inferiorly continuous with sacral sympathetic ganglion. Presynaptic neurons traveling from the spinal cord terminate in the paravertebral ganglia (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral) or the prevertebral ganglia. They synapse with either the postsynaptic neuron of the corresponding level of the spinal cord or ascend and descend to synapse at the lower or upper paravertebral ganglia, respectively. Neurotransmitters are released in the paravertebral ganglia to activate the postganglionic neurons to send efferent sympathetic output to the lower extremities to prepare the body for the ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù responses. These responses include dilating pupils, constricting blood vessels, and stimulating the secretion of acetylcholine, which causes smooth muscle contraction that leads to an increase in heart rate, blood sugar level, and blood pressure. The lumbar region L1 and L2 consist of neurons that innervate the adrenal gland, ureter, bladder, the lower extremities. The upper two lumbar ganglia (L1 and L2) of the sympathetic chain also give rise to the lumbar splanchnic nerves. Splanchnic nerves are paired visceral nerves carrying preganglionic sympathetic and general visceral afferent fibers. The lumbar splanchnic nerves travel through the lumbar sympathetic ganglion but do not synapse there. Instead, they synapse at the inferior mesenteric ganglion and innervate the smooth muscle lining the large intestines, kidney, bladder, glands of the hindgut, and pelvic viscera. Clinical Significance Because the lumbar sympathetic nerve fibers control the muscle of the lower extremities during ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù response, treatment targeting this region can help relieve chronic leg pain. One common procedure is the lumbar sympathetic nerve block. This procedure involves an injection of an anesthetic in the sympathetic nerve tissue to block the sympathetic nerves ipsilaterally and test for any damage to the sympathetic nerve chain. By disrupting the nerve supply from the sympathetic chain to the lower extremities, monitoring the decrease of pain and swelling in these regions can help locate the origin of pain in the patient. Because the blocking procedure is safe and minimally invasive, this treatment is used for a multitude of sympathetic mediated pain disorders, including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) that causes dysregulation of the central and autonomic nervous system. This causes an upregulation of pain and temperature control to the extremity that is affected. However, the patient could experience an allergic reaction to the medications given during the procedure if the patient has uncontrolled diabetes, poorly controlled heart problems, or is under other medications. Managing neuropathic pain is another use for a lumbar sympathetic block. The technique for this procedure is very specific. A fluoroscopic imaging projector is used to position the L2 and L3 to make it easily visible for the physician. The needle is aimed toward the anterior portion of the vertebral bodies of L2 and L3, and a c-arm is used to align specific views of the vertebral bodies. Since the great vessels are located ventrally to the vertebral bodies, the needle should be three to five millimeters dorsal to the most ventral portion of the vertebral body. The injection occurs once the correct position has been put in place. The physician should be able to see the coverage of the anterior portion of the vertebral body from L1 to L3. An increase by two or three degrees Celsius in the affected limb indicates a successful injection. Blood vessel dilation may also cause the affected limb to look very flushed.

Her task was to carry stores, refrigerated items, and equipment to ships in the fleet, and to remote stations and staging areas. The fifth Navy vessel to be named Arcturus, AF-52 was laid down on 8 December 1941 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Co. under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 184) as Golden Eagle; launched on 15 March 1942; sponsored by Mrs. John B. McKee; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 23 April 1943. She was operated under WSA charter by the United Fruit Co. until 1946 and, thereafter by the Sword Line and the United States Lines.  Assigned to the Army Transportation Corps  Between October 1948 and early 1950, she served the Army Transportation Corps as USAT Golden Eagle.  Assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service  In March 1950, Golden Eagle was transferred from the Maritime Commission to the Navy and was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) as USNS Golden Eagle (T-AF-52).  Return to the Navy as AF-52 with a civilian crew  Designated AF-52 and run by a Navy crew, Golden Eagle operated out of New York carrying supplies to American bases in the North Atlantic Ocean, Europe, and the Mediterranean. During November and December 1950, she was deployed to the Mediterranean for provisioning operations and, through the first six months of 1951, carried cargo to Bremerhaven and Liverpool. Following a second stint of service in the Mediterranean, she departed New York on 3 August for logistics duty off Thule, Greenland. Returning to New York on 13 September, she resumed transatlantic service on the 19th. Between 1952 and 1961, Golden Eagle made regular runs to ports in western Europe. Operating out of New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Norfolk, she steamed to Bremerhaven, Liverpool, and Rotterdam. During August and September 1952 and 1953, she supplied ships participating in Operation Blue Jay at Thule. Cargo missions in the North Atlantic sent her to Newfoundland, Iceland, and Baffin Island.  Commissioned with a Navy crew  Following her return from European waters to New York in the summer of 1961, Golden Eagle entered the New York Naval Shipyard to begin modifications to prepare her to become a commissioned ship. She was renamed Arcturus on 13 October 1961 and placed in commission at New York on 18 November 1961, Capt. Maxie B. Davis in command. Shakedown training in the West Indies and post-shakedown repairs at the Maryland Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, occupied her until the summer of 1962. In June 1962, Arcturus stood out of Norfolk, Virginia, on her first deployment to the Mediterranean as a unit of the U.S. 6th Fleet. Over the next decade, the ship provided logistics support for Navy forces operating in the Mediterranean Sea and in the West Indies. During most years, she served three tours of duty resupplying ships of the U.S. 6th Fleet. In between those assignments, Arcturus made logistics support voyages to the West Indies, conducted type training, and participated in multiship exercises. Regular overhauls periodically interrupted that schedule and, when they occurred, usually limited her to one or two deployments to the Mediterranean for the year in question. LTJG Dorsey served as Supply Officer from 1964-1966. LTJG Curry served as Deck Officer, then Navigator from 1965-1968.  Decommissioning  Late in 1972, as she prepared for the 24th Mediterranean deployment of her Navy career, her refrigeration compressor system broke down completely. Early in October, the Navy decided to inactivate her. On 2 November, Arcturus began preparations for decommissioning. She was placed out of commission at the Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Virginia, on 16 March 1973. On 18 October 1973, Arcturus was transferred to the Maritime Administration and berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet's contingent in Virginia's James River. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1976. In December 1985, she was authorized for use as a target to destruction. Final Disposition: sunk as a target, 24 July 1997.

Campos-Pons works primarily in photography, performance, audiovisual media, and sculpture. She is considered a \\"key figure\\" among Cuban artists who found their voice in a post-revolutionary Cuba. Her art deals with themes of Cuban culture, gender and sexuality, multicultural identity (Cuban, Chinese, and Nigerian) as well as interracial family (Cuban-American), and religion/spirituality (in particular, Roman Catholicism and Santer√≠a).Bell, Lynne. \\"History of People Who Were Not Heroes: A Conversation with Maria Magdalena Campos‚ÄêPons.\\" Third Text 12.43 (1998): 32-42. Print. Early life and education Campos-Pons was born in Matanzas, Cuba, in 1959 and grew up in a sugar plantation town called La Vega in Cuba. Her paternal great-grandparents were Nigerian (Yoruba). She also has Chinese and Hispanic heritage. Her African ancestors, who were brought over by sugar plantation owners in the late 19th century, passed-down traditions from Africa that influenced and became part of Campos-Pons's art. The African side of her family worked as slaves on sugar plantations and as domestic servants. The Chinese side of her family worked as indentured servants in sugar mills. When she was young, Campos relates that during a trip to the National Cuban Museum of Fine Art, she distinctly felt that black Cubans were conspicuously missing from the art. She did not feel as though black Cubans were equally represented. Campos-Pons has described much of her art education as very traditional, rooted in drawing and sculpture. She trained at the Escuela National de Arte in Havana between 1976 and 1979. From 1980 to 1989, she attended Havana's Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). The ISA allowed students to be exposed to international artistic movements and develop art that drew from Cuba's unique \\"mixed traditions and cultures.\\" Her ISA painting professor Antonio Vidal, a Cuban abstractionist, had a lasting impact on her work as a painter and she presented his work, along with her work with Neil Leonard at documenta 14 in Kassel, Germany. Campos-Pons conducted her post graduate studies at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 1988. While there, she created her first film that was scored by composer, saxophonist, Neil Leonard, whom she married in 1989. Before moving to Boston in 1991 to live with Leonard, she took a fellowship in Banff, Alberta. Since 2017, she has lived in Nashville, Tennessee. Career Between 1986 and 1989 Campos-Pons was professor of Painting and Aesthetic at the Instituto Superior de Arte. She started exhibiting internationally in 1984. In the late 1980s, her art work gained \\"international recognition\\" with her abstract paintings dealing with female sexuality. Her work coincides with the rise of the New Cuban Art movement. The New Cuban Art movement began as a reaction against the repressive aspects of the Cuban state and the introduction of conceptual art.Cuban Art Wikipedia The movement was less focused on technical skill and more on creating an art that was genuinely Cuban. A large part of this artistic movement was the introduction of Afro-Cuban presence, both as artists and within the art itself. Humor and spirituality were major themes in New Cuban Art. Her early work, often consisting of separate, shaped canvases, suggested fragmentation of the female self and referenced Afro-Cuban myths. She also explored reproductive rights and feminism through her art. Campos Pons work often revolves around feminist ideologies. In an interview with Lynne Bell, she stated: \\"My work in Cuba looked at issues of sexuality, women's place in society, and the representation of women in the history of art\\".Bell, Lynne. \\"History of People Who Were Not Heroes: A Conversation with Maria Magdalena Campos‚ÄêPons.\\"p 33. Since there was not a larger feminism movement in Cuba, it was only through the expression of art through artists like Campos-Pon and others that feminism was kept in the spotlight and popular consciousness. In the 1990s, Campos-Pons explored her family's ties to slavery and the Santer√≠a tradition carried over by her Yoruba family members. Santer√≠a is a spiritual practice which was developed by African slaves in Cuba by combining influences from Yoruba and Roman Catholic religious systems. Santer√≠a is often referred to as a \\"woman‚Äôs religion\\" as it is a religion shaped by women and practiced largely by women.Gutierrez, Eddy. \\"The Importance of Women in Santeria.\\" Santeria Church of the Orishas. 27 June 2012. Web. 25 Oct. 2015. Maria Magdalena Campos Pons uses Santer√≠a as a theme in her art to identify her Nigerian ancestry and Cuban heritage. She explores the rituals and symbols of Santer√≠a in some of her work from this time period. The Seven Powers Come by the Sea (1992) and The Seven Powers (1994) are installations that address slavery and make mention of various Yoruba gods and goddesses. During the 1990s sound became increasingly important in Campos- Pons' work and Leonard created electronic sound for all of her videos and installations. Sound for the installations often used Leonard's music incorporating fragments of Campos-Pons voice and field recordings, often heard via speakers that surrounded visitors. After 1994, there was a shift in Campos-Pons's work, and it became somewhat ethnographic.\\" This work is largely autobiographical and has tended to examine her ancestors' relationship with slavery and the sugar industry. Campos-Pon's work investigates \\"a felt history,\\" through the intersection of \\"non-spoken narratives\\" and \\"resilient culture\\". She started using large-format photographs which were often arranged into diptychs, triptychs or other configurations. These works are reminiscent of works by Lorna Simpson and Carrie Mae Weems. In the early 2000s, Campos- Pons returned to elements of abstraction and minimalism that were reminiscent of her early work, and admittedly influenced by her Cuban professor Antonio Vidal. According to Campos-Pons' artist statement, her work \\"renders elements of personal history and persona that have universal relevance...My subjects are my Afro-Cuban relatives as well as myself...The salient tie to familiar and cultural history vastly expands for me the range of photographic possibilities.\\" Campos-Pon is interested in showing \\"crosscultural\\" and \\"crossgenerational\\" themes dealing with race and gender as \\"expressed in symbols of matriarchy and maternity.\\" Campos-Pons says: \\"Of merging ideas, merging of ethnicities, merging of traditions... I am as much black, Cuban, woman, Chinese. I am this tapestry of all of that, and the responses to that could be very complicated and could include even anguish and pain.\\" Other ideas that her work explores includes exile, immigration, memory and Cuba itself. Her art has been shown in scores of solo and group exhibitions, including solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the Venice Biennale; the Johannesburg Biennial; the First Liverpool Biennial; the Dakar Biennale in Senegal; and the Guangzhou Triennial in China. Campos-Pons's work is in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Canada, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, The Museum of Fine Arts, the Miami Art Museum and the Fogg Art Museum. Campos-Pons currently teaches at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee. Audiovisual Collaboration with Neil Leonard Between 1988 and 2018, Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons and Neil Leonard created thirty- eight audio visual works together. By the time they met in 1988, Leonard had created sound for video installations and performances by Tony Oursler, Constance De Jong and Sam Durant. After meeting Leonard, sound became increasingly important in Campos-Pons's practice. She collaborated with Leonard to incorporate spoken word, music and field recordings into the work, and expand her practice to include time-based presentation. Leonard called on leading practitioners of Cuban religious music to play for their installation, video and performances including Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas, Los Hermanos Arango, Ramon Garcia Perez (Afrocuba de Matanzas), Roman Diaz (Yoruba Andabo) and Oriente Lopez to perform with them. Leonard created electroacoustic compositions for Campos-Pons‚Äô first film and videos, Rito de Iniciaci√≥n (1988) and Ba√±o Sagrado (1990). From 2010-2017, Campos-Pons created their most mature collaborations, balancing a sonic/visual content and ideas, and integrating the audio sources into sculptural components. During this period, Leonard focused on how global marketing impacted how we listen. His work with Campos- Pons included recordings and performances made in collaboration with butchers, bartenders, street criers, former dock workers and folkloric ensembles. Leonard and Campos-Pons' Installations and processions of this period were co- authored (commissioned, planned and executed as a team), including \\"Llego Fefa,\\"11 Bienal de Havana; \\"Habla Madre,\\" Guggenheim Museum; \\"Alchemy of the Soul,\\" Peabody Essex Museum; \\"Identified,\\" Smithsonian Institution National Portrait Gallery, \\"53+1=54+1+55.

The New York Times, 26 Sept. 2013. Web. 25 Oct. 2015. These pieces shifted the focus from Campos-Pons' biographical narrative to the Campos-Pons' and Leonard's interests in exploring the invisible threads connecting disparate cultures in the Americas. Art critic Holland Cotter describes Leonard's composition for the Cuban Pavilion at the 2013 Venice Biennale as a \\"haunting, rhythmic, chantlike score, secular spiritual music for a New World\\". Leonard's composition for their performance \\"Identified\\" (2016) at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery featured Leonard performing with multi-Grammy winning trumpeter Terence Blanchard, a folkloric Cuban ensemble and a jazz orchestra comprising students of the Duke Ellington School for the Arts. Musicians were located in the main atrium, stairwell and galleries and created a series of locations with unique sonic signatures that Campos-Pons wandered thought during the performance. Art The following are some examples of some of Campos Pons' art: * \\"53+1=54+1+55. Letter of the Year\\" from 2013, by Mar√≠a Magdalena Campos-Pons and Neil Leonard. This work of art was displayed in the Cuban Pavilion during the Venice Biennale of 2013.Fern√°ndez-Torres, Jorge (2013). ‚ÄúLa Pervesi√≥n de lo Cl√°sico: Anarqu√≠a de los Relatos.‚Äù Maretti Editore. p. 220. The work comprises 100 bird cages, 55 video players and 18 audio speakers. \\"Letter of the Year\\" addresses issues of home, migration, the necessity of finding and redefining the meaning of permanency and locality. Letter of the Year plays with two key sounds in Cuba today. Video interviews in the birdcages document the reconstruction of a dialogue between Cuban residents and their family members who live abroad. Outside the cages one hears recordings of street criers, known as pregoneros, a reflection of the increased liberalization of small businesses that exists within a void of corporate control. In an accompanying guerilla performance in Piazza San Marco Campos-Pons led a procession dressed in a \\"neo-Byzantine\\" costume combining elements of Chinese, Spanish and Afro-Caribbean attire, while Leonard performed with a hybrid ensemble of U.S., Cuban and Scottish musicians. * \\"Spoken Softly with Mama\\", from 1998, by Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons with sound by Neil Leonard (Nashville Scene). \\"Spoken Softly with Mama\\"combines elements of sculpture, painting, photography, performance, sound, and video to explore her African/Cuban roots and to address themes of gender, race, family and history. \\"Unfolding layers of history and experience, Campos-Pons brings to light the ephemeral qualities of everyday lives and untold stories. The artist's life and work involve a continuous engagement with her mother, sisters, family, and neighbors in Cuba. By extension, her work refers to the generations of Africans transported there in centuries past to work on sugarcane and tobacco plantations who transcended their oppression through the strength of their religious and cultural practices,\\" says Sally Berger, Assistant Curator, Department of Film and Video, who first showed the work at the Museum of Modern Art in 1998. The installation features an immersive quadrophonic soundtrack by Neil Leonard.Weinhuff, Christi. \\"Mama/Reciprocal Energy: Reciprocity as an Agent of Identity Formation in the Works of Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons.\\" Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Journal 8 (2012): 1-11. Print. The work was purchased by the National Museum of Canada, Ottawa. * \\"The One That Carried Fire\\", from 2011, by Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons (Studio International). This work of art explores the creation of gender identity, and in particular deals with the construction of femininity. The One That Carried Fire consists of organic lines and shapes of flowers painted in bright reds and pink, alluding to female reproductive organs. At the bottom is Campos Pons‚Äô self-portrait, whose natural hair holds a glowing orb connecting her to the burst of color and flowers, not only a physical connection with her femininity, but also a symbol of familial ties to her cultural heritage. * Matanzas Sound Map from 2017, by Mar√≠a Magdalena Campos-Pons and Neil Leonard. \\"Matanzas Sound Map\\" created for Documenta 14, comprises projected video, 10 discreet channels of audio (asynchronous with video). Cast glass, blown glass, handmade paper, coconut tree bark, coconuts shells, Calea stone Matanzas. The work explores the sonic landscape of Matanzas, from the harbor neighborhoods where iconic musical forms were born to remote estuaries where one imagines Cuba as it sounded before human intervention.

It aired on NBC on Saturday evenings in the 1963-1964 television schedule. It was produced by Arena Productions, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most successful in-house production companies of the 1960s. Situated at Camp Pendleton, the West Coast base of the U.S. Marine Corps, The Lieutenant focuses on the men of the Corps in peacetime with a Cold War backdrop. The title character is Second Lieutenant William Tiberius Rice, a rifle platoon leader and one of the training instructors at Camp Pendleton. An hour-long drama, The Lieutenant explores the lives of enlisted Marines and officers alike. The series was released on DVD in two half-season sets by the Warner Archive Collection on August 14, 2012. Synopsis Gary Lockwood starred as USMC Second Lieutenant William Tiberius Rice, a recent graduate of the United States Naval Academy who is assigned his first command, that of a rifle platoon. Rice is a young, educated idealist who still has much to learn from an older mentor. Robert Vaughn played Captain Raymond Rambridge, Rice's company commander, an up-from-the-ranks officer. Richard Anderson, remembered for playing Oscar Goldman in The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman, had a recurring role as battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Steve Hiland, and Linda Evans, later known for her roles on The Big Valley and as Krystle Carrington in Dynasty, appeared in several early episodes as Colonel Hiland's daughter Nan, who flirted with Rice. Production and broadcast Actor Gary Lockwood was twenty-six years of age and still an apprentice actor at the time the series premiered. Lockwood received his stage \\"family\\" name from early mentor Joshua Logan, who had participated in Mister Roberts and Picnic and whose middle name was Lockwood. A former UCLA college football player who could be violent and quick-tempered, and who had seriously injured a man in a brawl at a party, Lockwood tried to withdraw from the series program at the last moment, hoping to concentrate on films. He did not do so because the producers and network executives convinced him that there would be unpleasant payback if he did. Lockwood later compared being a TV star to being a jet pilot: many experts, he said, worked behind the scenes and then the pilot entered the hot seat and made it all work. As of April 2016, The Lieutenant was being transmitted on the GetTV digital OTA network on Wednesday evenings (CDT 1900hr, EDT 2000hr) in a four, back-to-back, one hour and fifteen minute/episode 'block' format. These transmissions did not follow the original airdate order. Controversy The installment \\"To Set It Right\\", which was written by Lee Erwin, was about racial prejudice, and featured Nichelle Nichols as the fianc√©e of a black Marine, portrayed by Don Marshall, with Dennis Hopper as the antagonist to that Marine. It was never transmitted. The subject of race was considered taboo in entertainment television in 1964, and because the network refused to broadcast \\"To Set It Right\\" or even pay for it, MGM had to shoulder the entire cost of production. The Paley Center for Media in New York City possesses a videotape of the episode. This episode was eventually transmitted on the cable channel TNT in the early 1990s. It was Roddenberry's frustrations over \\"To Set It Right\\" not being broadcast, and the fact that MGM Television had to bear the installment's entire financial burden, that inspired and affirmed his decision to turn Star Trek into an allegorical production. After The Lieutenant The Lieutenant performed well in the ratings, but was nevertheless canceled after only one season because, according to Roddenberry, the Vietnam War had made present-day military dramas toxic for television. In the final episode of the series, \\"To Kill A Man,\\" Rice is sent to a fictitious Asian country based on Vietnam as an advisor, his assignment as such mirroring the real-life situation for which the series had been canceled. Roddenberry recruited Lockwood one more time, in \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" the second pilot installment for Star Trek, as Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell. The title character in The Lieutenant was Second Lieutenant William Tiberius Rice; on the original series of Star Trek, the title character was James T. Kirk. It was not until the animated series that writer David Gerrold expanded the \\"T,\\" giving us Captain James Tiberius Kirk; however, that he chose \\"Tiberius\\" was purely coincidental. According to Gerrold, he had been influenced by I, Claudius, and had approached Roddenberry with his choice of middle name, but it was not until 2014 that Gerrold learned of the earlier use.Silverman, D.

Several actors who appeared on The Lieutenant‚Äîamong them Ricardo Montalb√°n, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, Walter Koenig, and Majel Barrett‚Äîwould later join Roddenberry in Star Trek.

Bergamo, ca. 1627; d. Vienna, 28 February 1698) was an Italian poet, librettist and impresario. His career can be divided into two parts: the years he spent at Venice, from 1650 to 1669, and the years at Vienna, from 1669 until his death. Minato is best remembered for his vast output as a librettist for opera. In total, he wrote over 200 librettos. His career began with Orimonte, written in 1650 for Francesco Cavalli. At this time he worked primarily as a lawyer, and it was only over a decade later that he abandoned this, his first profession, and turned fully to the composition of librettos and theatre management (as did his contemporary, Giovanni Faustini. Minato was also a member of several literary academies, including, along with Busenello, the Accademia degli Imperfetti, a group that devoted itself to studying the classics and contemporary jurisprudence. He wrote 11 librettos for Venice, most of them for Cavalli, though a few were first set by Antonio Sartorio. In 1665 he became a prominent figure in the running of the Teatro San Salvador. While there he collaborated with composer Giovanni Legrenzi in revising his opera Zenobia e Radamisto in 1667. In 1669 he left Venice to take up a post in Vienna as court poet to the Emperor Leopold I. At Vienna he wrote over 170 librettos, averaging around 5 a year, in genres as diverse as opera seria and festa teatrale. In addition to his duties as a writer of secular works, Minato was also a prolific producer of sacred texts, often described as oratorios. He largely provided these texts for performances given to mark special occasions - birthdays in the royal family, for example, or possibly Lenten celebrations or court weddings. Minato was a popular librettist and after his death his works were frequently revived by composers such as Johann Adolf Hasse, Handel, Giovanni Bononcini, and Telemann. References * Bibliography *S.

History  Origins  A group calling itself the Wild Magnolias, participating in the local \\"Indian masking\\" traditions and performing New Orleans Mardi Gras music, extends at least back into the 1950s. The group's lead member was called the Big Chief, and at least three Big Chiefs are known to have headed the band for short stints prior to 1964: Leon, Flap, and Joe Lee Davis. In 1964, Bo Dollis became Big Chief of the group, having previously participated in other Mardi Gras tribes such as the White Eagles and the Golden Arrows.  1970s: Commercial peak  In 1970, the group cut a 45rpm single for Crescent City Records entitled \\"Handa Wanda,\\" recorded and mixed by Cy Frost at Deep South Recording Studio. In addition to their usual ensemble of vocalist and a battery of percussion instruments (snares, tom toms, cymbals, beer bottles, cans, and so forth), the group culled together a number of local musicians, including pianist Willie Tee and guitarist Snooks Eaglin, as their backing band, called the New Orleans Project. The single received little airplay on radio but was successful in jukeboxes and through local word-of-mouth. On the strength of the single, the group signed with Barclay Records, a French label, and secured distribution of their albums in America with Polydor Records. Two critically acclaimed full-length albums followed, in 1974 and 1975, and a single, \\"Smoke My Peace Pipe (Smoke it Right)\\", cracked the Billboard Black Singles chart, peaking at #74 in 1974.[ Billboard singles], Allmusic.com Reviewing the 1974 Wild Magnolias LP in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: At the height of the group's popularity, they booked dates at Carnegie Hall and the Capital Centre in Washington, D.C.. Polydor elected not to release the second album stateside, which would not see release in America until 1993. The group returned to New Orleans and local festivals.  1980s‚Äì2000s  In the late 1980s, Allison Miner expressed interest in restarting the band's career, and booked them on new tours along with signing them to Rounder Records, who released an album of theirs, I'm Back...at Carnival Time (featuring the ReBirth Brass Band) in 1990.

With a permanent backing band, the group began embarking on worldwide tours. In 2001, Boudreaux left the group as a result of disputes with the group's manager over guarantee payments.Lone Monk (Best of New Orleans Article) In 2007, the group's two 1970s albums were re-released as a two-disc set with bonus materials on Sunny Side Records. 2013's New Kind of Funk LP marked the first Wild Magnolias record fronted by Dollis' son, Gerard \\"Bo Jr.,\\" who also now serves as Big Chief of the tribe. The LP also brought Monk Boudreaux back into the Magnolias fold, following Dollis' successful reclamation of The Wild Magnolias' trademark from his former manager.Big Chief Bo Dollis Reclaims Wild Magnolias Totem (Offbeat article) Boudreaux continues to occasionally perform with the group.

The models consist of numeric representations of positions, velocities and accelerations of major Solar System bodies, tabulated at equally spaced intervals of time, covering a specified span of years. Barycentric rectangular coordinates of the Sun, eight major planets and Pluto, and geocentric coordinates of the Moon are tabulated. DE405, created in May 1997, include both nutations and librations, and is considered the fundamental planetary and lunar ephemerides of The Astronomical Almanac. It is very large at 62.4 Megabytes, so smaller, more targeted versions have been created based on DE405.  History  There have been many versions of the JPL DE, from the 1960s through the present,See, for example, ; ; ; see also Newhall, Standish and Williams (1983). in support of both robotic and manned spacecraft missions. Available documentation is sketchy, but we know DE69 was announced in 1969 to be the third release of the JPL Ephemeris Tapes, and was a special purpose, short-duration ephemeris. The then-current JPL Export Ephemeris was DE19. These early releases were distributed on magnetic tape. In the days before personal computers, computers were large and expensive, and numerical integrations such as these were run by large organizations with ample resources. The JPL ephemerides prior to DE405 were integrated on a Univac mainframe in double precision. For instance, DE102, which was created in 1977, took six million steps and ran for nine days on a Univac 1100/81. DE405 was integrated on a DEC Alpha in quadruple precision.See Standish and Williams in the Sources In the 1970s and early 1980s, much work was done in the astronomical community to update the astronomical almanacs from the theoretical work of the 1890s to modern, relativistic theory. From 1975 through 1982, six ephemerides were produced at JPL using the modern techniques of least-squares adjustment of numerically-integrated output to high precision data: DE96 in Nov. 1975, DE102 in Sep. 1977, DE111 in May 1980, DE118 in Sep. 1981, and DE200 in 1982. DE102 was the first numerically integrated so-called Long Ephemeris, covering much of history for which useful astronomical observations were available: 1141 BC to AD 3001. DE200, a version of DE118 migrated to the J2000.0 reference frame, was adopted as the fundamental ephemeris for the new almanacs starting in 1984. DE402 introduced coordinates referred to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). The JPL ephemerides have been the basis of the Astronomical Almanac since 1981's DE200. The current (2018) Almanac is derived from DE430.  Construction  Each ephemeris was produced by numerical integration of the equations of motion, starting from a set of initial conditions. Due to the precision of modern observational data, the analytical method of general perturbations could no longer be applied to a high enough accuracy to adequately reproduce the observations. The method of special perturbations was applied, using numerical integration to solve the n-body problem, in effect putting the entire Solar System into motion in the computer's memory, accounting for all relevant physical laws. The initial conditions were both constants such as planetary masses, from outside sources, and parameters such as initial positions and velocities, adjusted to produce output which was a \\"best fit\\" to a large set of observations. A least-squares technique was used to perform the fitting. As of DE421, perturbations from 343 asteroids, representing about 90% of the mass of the main asteroid belt, have been included in the dynamical model. The physics modeled included the mutual Newtonian gravitational accelerations and their relativistic corrections (a modified form of the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equation), the accelerations caused by the tidal distortion of the Earth, the accelerations caused by the figure of the Earth and Moon, and a model of the lunar librations. The observational data in the fits has been an evolving set, including: ranges (distances) to planets measured by radio signals from spacecraft,See for a good summary of spacecraft radio-navigation. direct radar-ranging of planets, two-dimensional position fixes (on the plane of the sky) by VLBI of spacecraft, transit and CCD telescopic observations of planets and small bodies, and laser-ranging of retroreflectors on the Moon, among others. DE102, for instance, was fit to 48,479 observations. The time argument of the integrated ephemerides is a relativistic coordinate time scale called Teph,See sources cited at JPL ephemeris time argument Teph. necessary in precise work to account for the small relativistic effects of time dilation and simultaneity. In later ephemerides, Teph is essentially equivalent to the IAU definition of TCB.  Distribution  Positions and velocities of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets, along with the orientation of the Moon, are stored as Chebyshev polynomial coefficients fit in 32-day-long segments. The ephemerides are now available via World Wide Web and FTPSee the JPL FTP site with ephemerides (data files), source code (for access and basic processing of the data to recover positions and velocities), and documentation. as data files containing the Chebyshev coefficients, along with source code to recover (calculate) positions and velocities.See JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides Export Information README.txt version of 12 Oct 2007. Also available is an older version README.txt version of December 6, 2005 . Files vary in the time periods they cover, ranging from a few hundred years to several thousand, and bodies they include. Data may be based on each planet's true center or its barycenter. The use of Chebyshev polynomials enables highly precise calculations for a given point in time. DE405 recovery (calculation) for the inner planets is about 0.001 arcseconds (equivalent to about 1 km at the distance of Mars); for the outer planets it is generally about 0.1 arcseconds. The 'reduced accuracy' DE406 ephemeris gives an interpolating precision (relative to the full ephemeris values) no worse than 25 metres for any planet and no worse than 1 metre for the moon. Note that these precision numbers are for the interpolated values relative original tabulated coordinates. The overall precision and accuracy of interpolated values for describing the actual motions of the planets will be a function of both the precision of the ephemeris tabulated coordinates and the precision of the interpolation.  Applications  *JPL uses the ephemerides for navigation of spacecraft throughout the Solar System. Typically, a new ephemeris is computed including the latest available observations of the target planet(s), either for planning of the mission(s), or for final contact of the spacecraft with the target. See below, Recent ephemerides in the series. *The Astronomical Almanac for 1984 through 2002 were based on JPL ephemeris DE200, and from 2003 to 2014 the Astronomical Almanac was based on JPL ephemeris DE405.See US Naval Observatory (Naval Oceanography Portal), \\"History of the Astronomical Almanac\\" (accessed September 2017); see also Standish (1998) for details of DE405. The current Almanac is derived from DE430. *The JPL ephemerides are widely used for planetary science; some examples are included in the Notes and References. *Software is available to use the JPL ephemerides for the production of apparent ephemerides for any location and time; these are widely used by professional and amateur astronomers for reducing planetary observations and producing very precise observing guides.See the NASA SPICE system. *DE430 and DE431 can be used with the popular planetarium software Stellarium  Ephemerides in the series   Latest releases  Releases in 2016 and 2018 are based on DE430 and average in size (114 megabytes), covering 1549-Dec-21 through 2650-Jan-25. 20.8 MB versions, limited to 1900 January 4 to 2100 January 1, are also available as de438s.bsp and de436s.bsp. DE438 was created in 2018 and was based on the DE430, with improved orbital data for Mercury (for the MESSENGER mission), Mars (for the Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters), and Jupiter (for Juno). DE436 was created in 2016 and was based on the DE430, with improved orbital data for Jupiter specifically for the Juno mission). DE431 was created in 2013 and is intended for analysis of earlier historical observations of the Sun, Moon, and planets. It covers a longer time span than DE430 (13201 BC to AD 17191) agreeing with DE430 within 1 meter over the time period covered by DE430. Position of the Moon is accurate within 20 meters between 1913-2113 and that error grows quadratically outside of that range. It is the largest of the ephemerides files at 3.4 gigabytes. This ephemeris file is used by the JPL Horizons On- Line Ephemeris System.  Past releases  DE102 was created in 1981, includes nutations but not librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 1950. Covers early 1410 BC through late 3002 AD). DE200 was created in 1981; includes nutations but not librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 2000. Covers late 1599 AD through early 2169 AD) This ephemeris was used for the Astronomical Almanac from 1984 to 2003. DE202 was created in 1987; includes nutations and librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 2000. Covers late 1899 through 2049. DE402 was released in 1995, and was quickly superseded by DE403. DE403 was created 1993, released in 1995, expressed in the coordinates of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) reference frame, essentially the ICRF. The data compiled by JPL to derive the ephemeris began to move away from limited-accuracy telescopic observations and more toward higher-accuracy radar-ranging of the planets, radio-ranging of spacecraft, and very-long-baseline-interferometric (VLBI) observations of spacecraft, especially for the four inner planets. Telescopic observations remained important for the outer planets because of their distance, hence the inability to bounce radar off of them, and the difficulty of parking a spacecraft near them. The perturbations of 300 asteroids were included, vs DE118/DE200 which included only the five asteroids determined to cause the largest perturbations. Better values of the planets' masses had been found since DE118/DE200, further refining the perturbations. Lunar Laser Ranging accuracy was improved, giving better positions of the Moon. DE403 covered the time span early 1599 to mid 2199. DE404 was released in 1996. A so-called Long Ephemeris, this condensed version of DE403 covered 3000 BC to AD 3000. While both DE403 and DE404 were integrated over the same timespan, the interpolation of DE404 was somewhat reduced in accuracy and nutation of the Earth and libration of the Moon were not included. DE405 was released in 1998. It added several years' extra data from telescopic, radar, spacecraft, and VLBI observations (of the Galileo spacecraft at Jupiter, in particular). The method of modeling the asteroids' perturbations was improved, although the same number of asteroids were modeled. The ephemeris was more accurately oriented onto the ICRF. DE405 covered 1600 to 2200 to full precision. This ephemeris was utilized in the Astronomical Almanac from 2003 until 2014. DE406 was released with DE405 in 1998. A Long Ephemeris, this was the condensed version of DE405, covering 3000 BC to AD 3000 with the same limitations as DE404. This is the same integration as DE405, with the accuracy of the interpolating polynomials has been lessened to reduce file size for the longer time span covered by the file. DE407See, for instance, which mentions DE407 only very briefly. was apparently unreleased. Details in readily-available sources are sketchy. DE408See at NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility website and which states that DE408 covered 20,000 years. was an unreleased ephemeris, created in 2005 as a longer version of DE406, covering 20,000 years. DE409 was released in 2003 for the MER spacecraft arrival at Mars and the Cassini arrival at Saturn. Further spacecraft ranging and VLBI (to the Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Pathfinder and the Mars Odyssey spacecraft) and telescopic data were included in the fit. The orbits of the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft were reprocessed to give data points for Saturn. These resulted in improvements over DE405, especially to the predicted positions of Mars and Saturn. DE409 covered the years 1901 to 2019. DE410 was also released in 2003 covered 1901 - 2019, with improvements from DE409 in the masses for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the Earth-Moon system based on recent research. Though the masses had not yet been adopted by the IAU. The ephemerides were created to support the arrivals of the MER and Cassini spacecraft. DE411See, for instance, which compares DE413 output with DE411. was widely cited in the astronomical community, but not publicly released by JPL DE412See, for instance, which references DE412. was widely cited in the astronomical community, but not publicly released by JPL DE413 was released in 2004 with updated ephemeris of Pluto in support of the occultation of a star by its satellite Charon on 11 Jul 2005. DE413 was fit to new CCD telescopic observations of Pluto in order to give improved positions of the planet and its moon. DE414 was created in 2005 and released in 2006. The numerical integration software was updated to use quadruple-precision for the Newtonian part of the equations of motion. Ranging data to the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey spacecraft were extended to 2005, and further CCD observations of the five outer planets were included in the fit. Some data was accidentally left out of the fit, namely Magellan Venus data for 1992-94 and Galileo Jupiter data for 1996-97. Some ranging data to the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft orbiting the asteroid Eros was used to derive the Earth/Moon mass ratio. DE414 covered the years 1599 to 2201. DE418 was released in 2007 for planning the New Horizons mission to Pluto. New observations of Pluto, which took advantage of the new astrometric accuracy of the Hipparcos star catalog, were included in the fit. Mars spacecraft ranging and VLBI observations were updated through 2007. Asteroid masses were estimated differently. Lunar laser ranging data for the Moon was added for the first time since DE403, significantly improving the lunar orbit and librations. Estimated position data from the Cassini spacecraft was included in the fit, improving the orbit of Saturn, but rigorous analysis of the data was deferred to a later date. DE418 covered the years 1899 to 2051, and JPL recommended not using it outside of that range due to minor inconsistencies which remained in the planets' masses due to time constraints. DE421 was released in 2008. It included additional ranging and VLBI measurements of Mars spacecraft, new ranging and VLBI of the Venus Express spacecraft, the latest estimates of planetary masses, additional lunar laser ranging, and two more months of CCD measurements of Pluto. When initially released in 2008, the DE421 ephemeris covered the years 1900 to 2050. An additional data release in 2013 extended the coverage to the year 2200. DE422 was created in 2009 for the MESSENGER mission to Mercury. A Long Ephemeris, it was intended to replace DE406, covering 3000 BC to AD 3000. DE423 was released in 2010. Position estimates of the MESSENGER spacecraft and additional range and VLBI data from the Venus Express spacecraft were fit. DE423 covered the years 1799 to 2200. DE424 file at the JPL FTP website. was created in 2011 to support the Mars Science Laboratory mission. DE430 was created in 2013 and Is intended for use in analyzing modern data. It covers the dates 1550 Jan 01 to 2650 Jan 22 with the most accurate lunar ephemeris. From 2015 onwards this ephemeris is utilized in Astronomical Almanac. Beginning with this release only Mars' Barycenter was included due to the small masses of its moons Phobos and Deimos which create a very small offset from the planet's center. The complete ephemerides files is 128 megabytes but several alternative versions have been made available by JPL DE432 was created April 2014. It includes librations but no nutations. DE432 is a minor update to DE430, and is intended primarily to aid the New Horizons project targeting of Pluto.

Collins has a master's degree in theology from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in history from the Australian National University (ANU). He has taught church history and theology in Australia, the United States and Pacific countries and worked as a Catholic parish priest in Sydney and Hobart. He has been a Visiting Fellow at the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at the ANU and the Ethel Hayton Visiting Fellow in Religion and Society at the University of Wollongong. Collins has written for many Australian newspapers and magazines as well as for The Tablet, the National Catholic Reporter in the United States and for several Catholic magazines in Germany. Collins is a lifelong supporter of the Richmond Football Club in Melbourne. Doctrinal controversy The Vatican‚Äôs investigation centred on his 1997 book Papal Power, which was said to imply that \\"a true and binding revelation\\" does not exist; to deny that the Church of Christ is identified with the Catholic Church and to deny the doctrine of papal infallibility. Collins was further accused of holding the view that a teaching, to be considered church doctrine, must be approved through the sensus fidelium - the \\"sense of the faithful\\" - as well as by bishops and theologians. In March 2001 he resigned from his role as a Catholic priest due to a dispute with the Vatican‚Äôs Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith over his book, Papal Power. In explaining his resignation, Collins cited the increasing rigidity and sectarianism of the Vatican, stating that the August 2000 declaration Dominus Iesus expressed \\"a profoundly anti- ecumenical spirit at odds with the sense of God‚Äôs grace permeating the whole cosmos\\". Subsequent publications In 2002, Collins published The Modern Inquisition (Overlook Press), containing interviews with Father Tissa Balasuriya, Father Hans K√ºng, Father Charles Curran, Lavinia Byrne, Sister Jeannine Gramick and Father Robert Nugent, describing their experiences with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Indications of resignation of Pope Benedict XVI Collins suggestedPaul Collins on the implications of Pope Benedict's resignation, Paul Collins on ABC Radio National's \\"Religion and Ethics Report\\", Broadcast: Wednesday 13 February 2013 5:50PM that the elevation of Pope Benedict XVI's personal assistant, Georg G√§nswein, to Archbishop in early December 2012 (he was ordained as Bishop on 6 January 2013) was an indication of the impending resignation of Benedict XVI. Such elevations of the Pope's personal secretary have, previously, normally occurred only shortly before the death of a Pope, but while the Pope is still lucid.

These products are often repaired, refurbished and recycled by brokers, resellers or the original manufacturer. They are suitable for resale to customers as a lower cost alternative to buying new goods from standard distribution channels. History of term The term \\"green market\\" refers to the fact that the resold goods are put back into productive use, which is the most environmentally friendly use of used or discontinued products. Although the resale of green market goods sometimes competes with the original manufacturer, it also helps the manufacturer and the original end user by allowing the original end user to receive value for the product they no longer need and to use that value in purchasing new goods from the manufacturer. Parts from green market goods are sometimes necessary for the maintenance of current products that are in need of replacement parts which are no longer available. Black, grey and green market laws  Manufacturers that produce products including computer, telecom equipment, technology equipment very often sell those products that equipment through distributors. Most distribution agreements require the distributor to resell the products strictly to end users. However, some distributors choose to resell those products to other resellers. In the late 1980s manufacturers labeled the resold products as \\"grey market\\". There is nothing illegal about buying \\"grey market\\" products. In fact, the US Supreme Court has upheld that grey market products are legal for resale in the United States regardless of where they were produced or originally sold. The EU Supreme Court has similarly ruled that grey market products are legal for resale in the EU, provided that the equipment was originally sold by the manufacturer inside the EU. Manufacturers created the term \\"grey market\\" in an effort to instill fear in customers that buying such equipment was somehow illegal in an effort to assure manufacturers that customers would only purchase buy directly from them. The term \\"grey market\\" was chosen because of it similarity to the old term \\"Black Market\\" which refers to stolen and illegal products. Ecology Putting green market products into productive use or using the parts from green market products for repair is very cost effective and environmentally responsible. Replacing broken products with newer products has a negative effect on the environment and has been recognized as ecologically hazardous. Raw materials Electronic equipment is made up of many precious materials including highly refined glass, gold, aluminum, silver, polymers, copper and brass. Electronic recycling companies have the ability to store, disassemble, separate and transport these materials to companies for reuse in manufacturing. This is an environmentally better solution than dumping the used products in landfills. Such dumping may pollute soil and water with dangerous and non-biodegradable waste.

Definition A young man using a fish trap, an example of a more sedentary life rather than a nomadic one. The term \\"walkabout\\" has been used to characterise Indigenous Australians as highly mobile over the short-term. In the case of Aboriginal Australians, life-cycle stages, such as traditional rites of passage, seem to influence the motivations for movement more than the frequency of movement. But non- Aboriginal employers did not fully understand the abrupt leaving and returning as a valid reason for missing work. The reasons for leaving may be more mundane than originally thought: workers who wanted or needed to attend a ceremony or visit relatives did not accept employers' control over such matters.  Temporary mobility  \\"Temporary mobility\\" is a nomadic lifestyle that does not establish a permanent residence and includes a significant amount of movement for religious observance. Young Indigenous adults have the highest mobility rate of all age groups in Australia; males make up the majority. Youth is the time of the traditional \\"walkabout\\" rite of passage, which marks the transition into adulthood.  Research on temporary mobility  Mobility as a topic of research is difficult to track and measure. In present research, professionals have identified technology as being a factor of current mobility in young Indigenous adults in Australia. However, no formal, sound research has been conducted on this subject matter specifically. The lack of female Indigenous presence in research results has determined that Australian women participate in the national census less than their male counterparts leading to the underrepresentation of women in mobility research. This under-representation in research is due to the fact that most mobility research relies highly on census data as its primary form of data collection. The census occurs on one night nationally, which can make it difficult to track mobility, as does the finding that women in Australia are typically out of their usual residence at night, also leading to the under-representation of women in research. As of 2008, government statistical measures were not able to provide any detailed indication of the frequency, volume, or direction of Indigenous temporary mobility.  Public perception  Indigenous temporary mobility practices remain poorly understood within mainstream Australian society. They are often explained away as simply the product of a nomadic predisposition to wander aimlessly. This lack of understanding led to the term \\"walkabout\\" being used in a derogatory manner to explain unplanned and unexplained trips. Those that participate in walkabout, typically aboriginals from the Outback areas, have been labelled as transients, nomads, or drifters. The potential rise for the complexity of temporary mobility of traditional origins within modernisation is prevalent in current Australian society for the transition of Indigenous cultures from traditional activities toward modernity has given rise to growing recognition of the importance of traditional practices. The idea that there may be other more contemporary factors in temporary mobility alters the course of research conducted. Indigenous temporary mobility in and around remote Australia is due to the spiritual ties of the Indigenous people to the land of the Outback. With modernisation occurring all across Australia, walkabout will occur in more remote areas such as the outback to create a break from modern culture in order to create a connection with traditional, spiritual roots. Interior Australia (Outback) witnesses temporary mobility in those areas due to the lack of permanent residents in those areas. The spiritual attachment of aboriginals to the land of the Outback was a strong, unbreakable force that rooted social groups within their traditional territories. Aboriginal Australians make up the majority of the population in the Outback - up to 90% in some areas. The Outback covers more than three quarters of Australia‚Äôs landmass. Indigenous temporary mobility is characterised by familial and cultural obligations and conflicts. It is intentionally confined to Australian territories of ancestral belonging, typically in the Outback. These periods of mobility are typically ceremonial. These periods of mobility are unrelated to and often unseen by mainstream Australia not of Aboriginal beliefs. They often reflect and show disinterest in, or alienation from, the state. The physical geography of the Australian Outback has fundamentally shaped indigenous socio- spatial organisation and thus mobility practices. Owing to low population density and the uncharted aura of these areas it is not surprising that the Outback is the typical home to walkabout for aboriginals with ancestral ties to the land. For Aboriginal people in Central Australia, mobility is embedded in cultural practice as people‚Äôs ceremonial journeys‚ÄîWalkabout‚Äîfollowed dreaming tracks or songlines that linked sacred sites. These sites are often water sources or resource-rich places and are becoming important economically as well as spiritually.

From the 1930s on Steinbeck wrote about \\"the people,\\" his heart open to the longing, loneliness, despair and triumph of those on the edges. Americans were his people, and his last book, America and Americans (1966) expresses his enduring love for a democratic nation.

The game covers a hypothetical conflict between NATO and the Soviet Union. A Macintosh version was released in 1986., The History of SSI Games, Le Grenier du Mac (in French) North Atlantic '86 was Grigsby's third game. It began development as a part-time project while he worked for the United States Department of Defense, like his previous titles Guadalcanal Campaign and Bomb Alley, but Grigsby left the position to become a full-time game developer during North Atlantics production. The title reuses the game engine from his first two games, with upgrades. He followed it with Carrier Force (1983). Game details The back story showed that Warsaw Pact forces had successfully overrun most of Western Europe by the end of August, 1986. Next, the naval and air forces of the Soviet Union needed to close the North Atlantic and sever the supply line between North America and Britain. NATO's task was to keep the sea lanes open and Britain supplied, primarily by using convoys of supply and troop ships guarded by carrier battle groups when available. Nuclear weapons were not available to either the NATO or Soviet Union commanders. Game play options allowed two human players to pick either the NATO or Soviet Union. Solo play was limited to the NATO side only as the Soviet Union was always played by the computer AI. The game supplied two mini- game scenarios and two full campaign scenarios. Duration for the two mini- games were 12 and 20 turns each. Duration for the full campaigns were 252 and 122 turns. In Grigsby's prior games, the computer kept track of the number of torpedoes carried on each ship and submarine. But the need to keep track of so many other variables in North Atlantic '86 necessitated deletion of those counters. Instead each ship had a fixed probability of exhausting its stock of torpedoes each time it fired. This meant, for example, that a submarine might run out of torpedoes after its first attack. Other weaknesses of North Atlantic '86 included the ability of unarmed search and cargo aircraft to go anywhere they had the range to go, immune to enemy fighters. This allowed bases that should have been isolated to be supplied and active. Additionally, search aircraft could spot enemy ships almost anywhere in the Atlantic. This led to airstrikes every twelve hours whenever ships were at sea, an unlikely tempo of operations. In spite of these and other limitations, the game was an extraordinary achievement, given that all program code and game data were on a 140KB floppy disk, and the game executed on an Apple II with as little as 48KB of RAM. In fact, Grigsby pushed the limits of the Apple II so far that there would not have been enough memory available without using SSI's proprietary RDOS instead of Apple's conventional operating system. The players faced a number of challenging decisions, but they had a variety of potent ships and aircraft at their disposal. Although the game relied on text for most of the interaction with the players, most players found high excitement levels during the combat phase. Program execution was surprisingly fast for a BASIC program on an 8-bit 1 MHz CPU, although later turns when most vessels and aircraft were deployed could take 4‚Äì6 hours to execute. Combat was intense, and losses on both sides were high. Development North Atlantic '86 was designed by Gary Grigsby. He worked on the game part-time for the first half of production, while holding a full-time civil service position. He had made his previous titles Guadalcanal Campaign and Bomb Alley entirely in his spare time. The game used the same basic program used by Grigsby's previous Guadalcanal Campaign and Bomb Alley, which were coded in the Applesoft BASIC language. Each turn represented twelve hours, but in North Atlantic '86, sea, air and land combat could also take place at night instead of only during daytime turns. There were many additional features, such as electronic warfare, missile attacks, and the ability to conduct airborne assaults using paratroopers. Game operations allowed certain forward bases to be captured and recaptured which made the possession of Iceland especially valuable. Grigsby released North Atlantic '86 in 1983, the same year he launched Carrier Force.

Coaching career After retiring as a player he became a development coach at the Essendon Football Club and helped the club to their 2000 premiership. He joined the Port Adelaide Football Club in 2002 as an assistant coach, a position he held in their 2004 premiership season. Melbourne senior coach At the end of the 2007 season, he was appointed as the new senior coach of the Melbourne Football Club for the 2008 season. Season 2008 started badly for Bailey, with the Demons losing their first six games by lopsided margins before winning its first match of the season against Fremantle in round seven. Things did not get better, as the Demons lost the next six games, however they won their second game in Round 14 against Brisbane. Then they lost the next five games and won their third game in Round 20 against West Coast. Melbourne finished 16th at the end of the 2008 season, claiming the wooden spoon with three wins and 19 losses. The 2009 season started with three losses for the Demons before an inspiring and unexpected win by eight points against Richmond in their round four clash at the MCG. At the mid-way point of the 2009 season, the Demons sat last on the ladder with one win and eleven losses, but Bailey retained his commitment to youth and gave many youngsters on Melbourne's list valuable experience over the first half of the year. The club finished the 2009 season with four wins and 18 losses and finished last on the ladder for the second year running. The 2010 season began with a first round-loss to Hawthorn by 56 points in which the playing group and Bailey were criticised in the media for their on-field performance. But the Demons bounced back in their second game of the season, losing to eventual premier Collingwood by just one point. Round three saw the Demons chalk up their first victory of the season, a 16-point victory over the Adelaide Crows. This was followed by big victories over Richmond and the Brisbane Lions, the latter considered to be a major upset at that point of 2010, as the Lions were undefeated at the time, and fielded big name players including Brown and Fevola. Despite elevated expectations the Demons then went on to lose their next three games. A narrow victory over Port Adelaide in round 9 however gave fans something to celebrate. Again the club suffered several more losses following the win, as well as a nail biting draw to Collingwood in the annual Queens Birthday Clash. The club found some form again in the following weeks, beating Essendon in round 15, narrowly losing to Fremantle in round 16 (after a huge comeback) and winning again in round 17, thrashing 2005 premiers Sydney by 73 points. A 10-point win over struggling Brisbane at the Gabba and then Richmond at the MCG followed. Ultimately the Demons finished 12th on the ladder at season's end, a somewhat huge improvement from the past two seasons. The 2011 season saw the Demons experience great fluctuations in form. Starting the season with a draw against Sydney, the team was well beaten by Hawthorn in the second round, despite leading at half time. Consecutive victories followed, with a narrow win over the Brisbane Lions, and league newcomers Gold Coast by 90 points. Following a bye, the club suffered a 54-point defeat at the hands of West Coast, before bouncing back the following week, thrashing Adelaide by 96 points, recording their biggest ever victory against them. It was also their biggest win under Dean Bailey to date. Three losses followed, followed by a surprise victory over Essendon. The traditional Queen's Birthday clash, which had been drawn the previous year, turned into a blow out with Collingwood winning by 88 points, the biggest margin in a Queen's Birthday clash to date. The Demons then went on to record another massive turnaround, recording their biggest ever victory over Fremantle, by 89 points the following week. This was followed up with a victory over . The next week saw Melbourne face the Western Bulldogs at Etihad Stadium. It was a disappointing week for the Demons as they lost by 64 points. Melbourne had the bye the following week, before yet another turnaround followed in a win over in Darwin, before losing to by 54 points the following round. In Round 19, Melbourne suffered a 186-point defeat against Geelong at Skilled Stadium, the defeat marking the second greatest losing margin in VFL/AFL history. The day after the match, a board meeting was scheduled, where Bailey's sacking was announced by club president Jim Stynes. He left the club with only 22 wins from 83 matches; a winning percentage of just over 25%. Bailey was credited for the way he rebuilt the club following the retirements of David Neitz, Adem Yze, Russell Robertson, Jeff White and Matthew Whelan amongst others, and not condemned for his aforementioned dismal winning percentage during his tenure at Melbourne. Bailey had stated that he \\"did the right thing by the Melbourne Football Club\\" and took the club in a new direction by obtaining high draft picks used to recruit Jack Watts, Jack Trengove and Tom Scully.Bailey 'coached for picks' - AFL.com.au In addition it was revealed he deliberately played key players in different positions. Eighteen months after his sacking as Melbourne coach, an investigation into the club's 2009 season found Bailey and then football manager Chris Connolly guilty of \\"acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the competition\\". This related most specifically to a meeting in July 2009, which became known colloquially as \\"the vault\\", in which Connolly allegedly openly discussed the potential benefits to the club of tanking. Bailey, then an assistant coach at the Adelaide Crows, was banned from coaching for the first sixteen rounds of the 2013 season, meaning he could not engage with any players during his suspension. Adelaide assistant coach On 4 October 2011, Bailey was appointed to the Adelaide Football Club in a new role as a strategy and innovation coach. In a statement released by Adelaide on 27 November 2013, it was revealed that Bailey was suffering from cancer and was on indefinite leave. He never returned to work, though he did visit the club in late 2013 and early 2014 during pre-season training before his untimely death in March.Dean Bailey's impromptu visit at training gives Adelaide Crows a lift, Herald Sun, 6 December 2013 Personal life Bailey was married to Caron and had two sons.

He later became a professor in charge of teacher education at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. Early history Peter Randall was born in Durban in 1935, the youngest of four sons. His father, Walter Kenneth Randall, worked as a journalist and court reporter for the Natal Mercury newspaper, and his mother, Elizabetha Margaretha Randall (n√©e Powrie), was a specialist nursing sister. Randall was educated at the Open Air School, the Durban Preparatory High School, and Kearsney College, and after matriculating he trained at Natal Teachers‚Äô Training College (NTC) in Pietermaritzburg. He also completed a BA in English and history through the University of South Africa. He was the first Kearsney matriculant to obtain a distinction in English, and he gained distinctions in English each year thereafter, from teacher training to BA level. In 1956 he was awarded a medal for best final-year student at NTC. At NTC he met Isobel Hickman, the previous final-year medallist, and they were married in 1958 in Greytown. From 1957 to 1961 Randall was employed by the Natal Education Department, and taught at Vryheid High School and Greytown Junior School. In late 1961 he and Isobel travelled to England, and from 1962 through 1963 they were employed as teachers by Essex County Council (Peter taught at Broadfields County Primary and Mark Hall Secondary, Harlow). During this time they toured Europe and Britain in an old Bedford van, and before returning to South Africa they worked as apple-pickers. In early 1964 they returned to Pietermaritzburg, and from 1964 until mid-1965 Randall lectured at NTC and was the warden of the men's residence. Daughter Lee-Ann was born in 1964, and in 1965 they moved to Johannesburg, where their second daughter Susan was born. Their third child Jonathan died as an infant; a second son named David was born in 1970. Anti-apartheid activity While a student at NTC, Randall took an interest in radical politics and approached Peter Hunter, a lecturer with similar views, with the hope of becoming constructively involved. Hunter took him to a school in Sobantu Village in Pietermaritzburg, where teachers had to learn Afrikaans because of the Bantu Education policy, and Randall went there several times to teach Afrikaans and to learn some Zulu. Other important influences on his thinking at this time were leading Liberal Party figures such as Peter Brown, author Alan Paton and senator Edgar Brookes. From July 1965 to mid-1969 Randall was Assistant Director of the South African Institute of Race Relations, based in Johannesburg. The Institute published several titles by him, including a series of talks he gave on human rights and the need for social justice. From mid-1969 to 1972 he was Director of Spro-cas (Study Project on Christianity in Apartheid Society), which was sponsored by the Christian Institute and South African Council of Churches (SACC). Randall worked closely with Beyers Naud√© who was heading the Christian Institute, and with other leading anti-apartheid clerics like Denis Hurley and Desmond Tutu. Although Spro-cas was intended as a relatively short- term project, it put together a substantial body of publications. Under the directorship of Randall, it published some 25 titles with the view to contributing to the search for social justice in South Africa. One of those was Cry Rage!, an innovative collection of anti-poems by James Matthews and Gladys Thomas, which became one of the icons of the Black Consciousness Movement.The Literature Police (Apartheid censorship and its cultural consequences), Peter D. McDonald (2009), Oxford University Press, New York. ‚ÄúSpro-cas 1‚Äù, the study project, was followed by ‚ÄúSpro-cas 2‚Äù, the action project, again with Randall as Director. After discussions ‚Äî particularly with Bennie Khoapa and Steve Biko, it was decided to split the project into a Black Community Programme and a White Consciousness Programme. The aim was for the BCP to develop community education programmes, and for the WCP, where a key figure was Horst Kleinschmidt, to make South African whites aware of social injustice and the need for change. The project ran until the BCP was banned in 1977. The story is told in A Taste of Power, the final Spro-cas report written by Randall.A Taste of Power (1973). The final co-ordinated Spro-cas report; Spro-cas publication number 11. Ravan: Johannesburg. Although some details had to be glossed over in this book due to state restrictions on the media, it paid considerable attention to Black Consciousness as well as to the sins of the apartheid government. The radical work of the Spro-cas projects drew varied responses and was discussed in public debate, as the following quotations indicate: *‚ÄúThe Spro-cas reports seem all that is left of sanity in a land gone mad.‚Äù - Anthony Richmond, The Cape Herald, Cape Town, 20 October 1973. *‚Äú[Spro-cas is] a demonical movement originating from American Marxism.‚Äù - Rev C.J. Mans, quoted in The Daily News Durban, 28 April 1973. *‚ÄúMuch more cleverly disguised and therefore much more sinister‚Ä¶ the Spro-cas missionaries have been the chief purveyors of the myths of Black Theology and Black Consciousness.‚Äù - editorial The Education Journal, The Teachers‚Äô League, Cape Town, September 1973. *‚ÄúOne achievement which clearly illustrates Spro-cas‚Äôs very dynamic flexibility is the easy and amicable emergence of an active black separatist movement within Spro-cas itself‚Ä¶ its impact on political thought in South Africa has been considerable.‚Äù - Marie Dyer, review in Reality, January 1974. (With reference to the Black Community Programs under the leadership of Steve Biko and Bennie Khoapa). *‚ÄúA ruthlessly logical summing up of the six Spro-cas commissions‚Ä¶ one‚Äôs constant instinct is to cry: ‚ÄòFor God‚Äôs sake, surely government thinkers must take note of this‚Äô.‚Äù - Tony Richmond, review of A Taste of Power in The Cape Herald, Cape Town, 20 October 1973. *‚Äú...noting the invaluable contribution the Spro-cas 1 publications have made to the awareness of South African society... strongly urges students to lend their full support to the Spro-cas 2 programs...‚Äù - Resolution 112, 48th Congress of the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS), 1972. *‚Äú All South Africans who are committed to bringing about change in our society should read the Spro-cas reports.‚Äù -Black Sash Journal, August 1972. From 1973 to October 1977 Randall was Director of Ravan Press, which was established in 1972 by Beyers Naud√©, Danie van Zyl and Randall (the unusual spelling of ‚ÄúRavan‚Äù is due to the word being made up of the initial letters of Randall, van Zyl, and Naud√©). Randall's role was diverse: editor, publisher, salesman, and financial manager. In a time when ‚Äúnon-whites‚Äù were severely repressed by the government, Ravan Press became an important avenue through which dissident voices could be heard.The Politics of Publishing in South Africa (2000) (Eds. Evans N. & Seeber M.) Holger Ehling Publishing Ltd, London. Its first literary title was Sing for our Execution (1973) by Wopko Jensma, and Randall proceeded to develop an impressive list of emerging writers. His approach was that: \\"Artists are able to interpret our situation and speak to people of all groups in a universal medium and in a way that academics, journalists and clergy cannot because they are so firmly labelled in their ethnic or denominational boxes.\\" Ravan had several publishing ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù, most notable being the acceptance of JM Coetzee's first book, Dusklands, after it had been rejected by other South African and international publishers. Other firsts included works by Sipho Sepamla, Chabani Manganyi, Miriam Tladi, Peter Wilhelm, and Stephen Gray. Due to his involvement in anti-apartheid publishing, Randall experienced severe state repression from 1970 onwards. His passport was confiscated in 1972 for a period of ten years. It was returned for one month in 1981, after pressure from German and American publishers for Randall to attend the Frankfurt Book Fair; it was returned in full in 1982. Randall was also prosecuted in 1973 under the Commissions Act for refusing to give evidence before the Schlebusch Commission, along with Beyers Naud√© and others, and was sentenced to three months imprisonment, suspended.The Trial of Beyers Naud√©: Christian witness and the rule of law. (1975) Published by Search Press Limited, London, in conjunction with Ravan Press, Johannesburg. In 1974 the three founding directors of Ravan were prosecuted under the Internal Security Act for publishing the words of a ‚Äúbanned person‚Äù (Paul Pretorius of NUSAS), but the case was dismissed on a technicality because the security police confused Spro-cas and Ravan Press. Randall also experienced harassment such as having his mail and telephone calls intercepted, attempts to plant spies, intimidation of bookshops not to stock Ravan titles, having his visitors trailed, cars being outside his house with listening devices in them, and so on. An unsuccessful attempt was made to entice both Randall and Naud√© into a relationship with a buxom Post Office employee. In 1974 Randall stood as a Social Democratic candidate in the Von Brandis constituency in central Johannesburg, in the national general election. Horst Kleinschmidt was his electoral agent, and to general surprise they managed to gain a thousand votes and save their deposit in a safe United Party seat. The offices of Ravan Press in Braamfontein, Johannesburg were the target of bomb threats and acts of vandalism such as slogans being painted on the walls. Randall once endured a four-hour security police raid of Ravan (along with the other organisations in Diakonia House, such as the Christian Institute and SACC), during which every document and letter‚Äîand his personal diary‚Äîwas scrutinised. On 17 October 1977 Randall was served with banning orders by the Minister of Justice, Jimmy Kruger. At least forty black leaders were detained in the same month, and the Christian Institute and seventeen other organisations‚Äîmainly black consciousness groups‚Äîwere declared unlawful and were not allowed to continue their existence.Not without Honour: Tribute to Beyers Naud√© (ed. P. Randall). (1982) Ravan: Johannesburg. Other white South Africans banned in that month were Beyers Naud√©, Cedric Mayson, Brian Brown, and Theo Kotze, all of whom were associated with the Christian Institute. The banning orders were for five years. In terms of Randall's banning order, he was forbidden to attend gatherings (the legal consensus was that this meant meeting with more than one other person at a time); he was forbidden to leave the Johannesburg magisterial area without the permission of the chief magistrate, Mr Francis; and he was forbidden to enter schools, factories, publishing houses and so on. He was also required to report weekly to his local police station and sign the register, and when going on holiday he had to report to the local police station on arriving at his destination. To attend functions at his children's schools or take his family on holiday he had to seek permission, which was sometimes granted and sometimes not. Mr Francis would forward Randall's requests to the Minister, who would call for reports and recommendations from the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) and the security police, and the Minister would then instruct Francis. The granting or withholding of permission appeared to be completely arbitrary and no appeal was possible. In 1981 Randall applied for permission to attend the Frankfurt Book Fair‚Äîa request which drew divergent responses from BOSS and the security police. The head of BOSS suggested that it was best to let Randall attend the Fair, stating that ‚Äúhy sal in elk geval gemonitor word‚Äù (in any case he will be monitored). The monitoring, it seems, was carried out by an attractive young woman from the South African Embassy in Bonn, who befriended Randall at the Book Fair and subsequently followed him to England, then to Jersey (where he visited his brother-in-law, Ron Hickman OBE, the designer of the Lotus Elan sports car and inventor of the Black and Decker Workmate), and finally back to South Africa, where she left government service and became a drama teacher. In Frankfurt Randall considered applying for political asylum in the UK, thus going into exile there, but ultimately he decided against this. His banning order was lifted later the same year by the new Minister of Justice, Kobie Coetzee, after approaches from the Progressive Party and others. Randall's role in the anti-apartheid movement may not always have been very public. The South African Council of Churches pays tribute to him on their website with these words: \\"The final list of twenty five publications in the four year history (of Spro-cas) is testament to the courage and determination of Peter Randall and all who worked with him on the SPROCAS project.\\" The effect of Randall's work reached into the heart of the Apartheid government as attested to by Mr Kobie Coetszee, then the Minister of Justice, and who is generally seen as one of the prime movers in facilitating the dialogue between Mr Nelson Mandela and the government. In an interview with Padraig O'Malley on 27 September 1997 he stated that exposure to people like Beyers Naud√©, the thinking of Steve Biko, and works like A Taste of Power (by Randall) lead him and others to acknowledge the righteousness of aspirations which were not satisfied but were being actively suppressed. Academic career In 1977, prior to his banning, Randall was employed as a part-time temporary organiser of teaching practice by the Education Department at the liberal University of the Witwatersrand (Wits). His banning order meant that he could no longer officially work at Ravan Press, and Wits approached the Minister for permission to employ him full-time. This was granted after six months, during which Wits continued to pay his salary although he could not fulfill his duties. Unofficially, he did continue his involvement with Ravan, acting in an advisory capacity and carrying out some editorial responsibilities. He remained in employment at Wits until his retirement in 1995, eventually becoming professor assignatus and director of teacher training. During this time he wrote an M.Ed dissertation on private schools, which was later published as Little England on the Veld. In 1989 he was awarded a Ph.D degree for his thesis on the role of the history of education in the training of teachers. Part of this research included Randall making study tours to the UK and US. While at Wits University, Randall published a few academic articles and edited several collections. He delivered papers at international conferences held by the History of Education Society in Berlin, Lisbon, Cracow, and Dublin, some of which were published in the proceedings of the International Standing Committee on the History of Education. In the 1980s and 1990s Randall and his wife Isobel attended several conferences of the IBBY (International Book Board for Young People) in Groningen, Seville and Berlin, where they delivered joint papers. After 1995 he continued as a part-time lecturer at Wits, a part-time editor at Ravan Press, and a book reviewer for Financial Mail. His career as a book reviewer had begun thirty years and some 300 titles earlier with the Rand Daily Mail, and during Randall's banning his reviews had appeared under his wife Isobel's name. Current From 2002, Peter and Isobel Randall spent much of their time in the United Kingdom, establishing a home in the West Midlands. In 2007 both became naturalised British citizens, while retaining their South African citizenship. During 2005 - 2006 the South African History Archives (SAHA) obtained from the State Archives copies of all the reports and recommendations from BOSS and the security police relating to Randall. A copy of the documentation was given to Randall and another copy is archived by SAHA at Wits. Works Archives *The National Library of South Africa lists 46 works by Randall in its catalogue. These include earlier works of an educational nature for schools. *The William Cullen Library at the University of the Witwatersrand holds a collection of Spro-cas titles and other works by Randall. *The catalogue of the Library of Congress in Washington DC lists 20 of Randall's works. *Copies of the Ravan Press correspondence between Randall and various authors (including JM Coetzee), as well as manuscripts, are archived in the National English Literary Museum in Grahamstown, South Africa. *The South African Institute of Race Relations' archives include several of Randall's titles published between 1965 and 1969.

Constable elections  For the first time since 1948 the elections of constables for the twelve parishes of Jersey have been synchronised so that polling, where necessary, will take place on the same day as the senatorial election on 15 October 2008, in accordance with the Conn√©tables (Jersey) Law 2008 (registered 28 March 2008). At Assemblies of Electors held in nine parishes on 17 September 2008, constables in five parishes were returned unopposed: St Brelade, St Martin, St Ouen, Trinity and St Saviour. The constables of the other parishes declined to stand down to recontest their seats, preferring to serve out their full term so that the provisions of the law will apply to the next mandate from 2011.  St Clement  Sitting Constable Derek Gray did not seek re-election. Senator Leonard Norman beat Deputy Gerard Baudains and Centenier Edgar Wallis.  St Helier  Following his 2008 re-election, Simon Crowcroft declared that he would not stand down to fight a second election in ten months, despite speculation that he would fight a senatorial campaign with a view to becoming Chief Minister.  St Lawrence  Deputy Deidre Mezbourian beat Chef de Police Tim Tindall.  St Mary  Sitting Constable Ken Le Brun is standing down. Deputy Juliette Gallichan beat former Chef de Police Terry Renouf.  St Peter  Procureur du Bien Public John Refault beat Deputy Collin Egr√©.  Senatorial election  The senatorial election took place on 15 October 2008. The election was island-wide and there were six seats available. At the Assembly of Electors held in Saint Helier on 16 September 2008, 21 candidates were nominated. Final results are as follows: Rosette worn by a Le Marquand supporter {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" |- style=\\"background- color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\" Jersey senatorial election, 2008 |-bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=2 style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" |Candidate ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" |Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" |Percentage |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Ian Le Marquand align=\\"right\\" 14,238 align=\\"right\\" 12.35% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Alan Breckon align=\\"right\\" 10,273 align=\\"right\\" 8.91% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Alan Maclean align=\\"right\\" 9,094 align=\\"right\\" 7.89% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Paul Routier (incumbent) align=\\"right\\" 8,775 align=\\"right\\" 7.61% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Philip Ozouf (incumbent) align=\\"right\\" 8,712 align=\\"right\\" 7.55% |- ! style=\\"background- color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Sarah Ferguson align=\\"right\\" 8,576 align=\\"right\\" 7.45% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#B31B1B; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Jersey Democratic Alliance Geoff Southern align=\\"right\\" 7,194 align=\\"right\\" 6.24% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Mike Higgins align=\\"right\\" 6,979 align=\\"right\\" 6.05% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Mike Vibert (incumbent) align=\\"right\\" 6,098 align=\\"right\\" 5.29% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#36454F; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Time4Change/Reform Montfort Tadier align=\\"right\\" 5,011 align=\\"right\\" 4.34% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#B31B1B; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Jersey Democratic Alliance Trevor Pitman align=\\"right\\" 4,931 align=\\"right\\" 4.28% |- ! style=\\"background- color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Peter Troy align=\\"right\\" 3,927 align=\\"right\\" 3.40% |- ! style=\\"background- color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Cliff Le Clercq align=\\"right\\" 3,597 align=\\"right\\" 3.12% |- ! style=\\"background- color:#78866B; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Jersey 2020 Daniel Wimberley align=\\"right\\" 3,458 align=\\"right\\" 3.00% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Jeremy Ma√ßon align=\\"right\\" 3,130 align=\\"right\\" 2.71% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#36454F; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Time4Change/Reform Nick Le Cornu align=\\"right\\" 3,074 align=\\"right\\" 2.67% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Chris Perkins align=\\"right\\" 2,768 align=\\"right\\" 2.40% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#78866B; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Jersey 2020 Mark Forskitt align=\\"right\\" 1,922 align=\\"right\\" 1.67% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#78866B; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Jersey 2020 Nick Palmer align=\\"right\\" 1,538 align=\\"right\\" 1.33% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Adrian Walsh align=\\"right\\" 1,210 align=\\"right\\" 1.05% |- ! style=\\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\" Independent Mick Pashley align=\\"right\\" 682 align=\\"right\\" 0.59% |-bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\" Invalid or blank votes align=\\"right\\" 144 align=\\"right\\" 0.12% |-bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\" Voter turnout colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"right\\" 44.13% |}  Candidates  Three sitting senators did not seek re-election: *Wendy Kinnard *Frank Walker *Leonard Norman (confirmed June 2008 his intention to stand for Constable of St. Clement) The following candidates were sitting senators seeking re-election: *Philip Ozouf *Paul Routier *Mike Vibert The following candidates were sitting deputies seeking who ran in the senatorial election: *Alan Breckon *Sarah Ferguson *Alan Maclean *Peter Troy *Geoff Southern Candidates declared the following political affiliations: *Deputy Geoff Southern and Trevor Pitman were candidates of the Jersey Democratic Alliance *Nick Le Cornu and Montfort Tadier were members of Time4Change/Reform *Daniel Wimberley, Mark Forskitt, and Nick Palmer are members of Jersey 2020  Deputy elections  The election for deputies took place on 26 November 2008.

The program originally aired in Canada in 1986 and debuted on the USA Network in the United States (US) on September 29, 1986. Ross Shafer was the host and Jane MacDougall was the co-host/announcer; MacDougall was later replaced by Marilyn Smith. The series was the first game show to be produced by Blair Murdoch and was taped at CKVU-TV in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Kathy Morse worked on the show as an assistant to the producers and later became the Mayor of Maple Ridge, British Columbia. Gameplay Two contestants of the same sex competed, facing a panel of three members of the opposite sex. Each game alternated between men \\"chasing\\" women and women chasing men. The two members of the same sex competed to capture panel members, who, in turn, did their best to avoid capture. In round one panelists started with $100. The champion contestant chose one of the three panelists, who asked a \\"true/false\\" question pertaining to topics such as love, sex and relationships. The contestant was required to correctly judge the truth of the statement in order to capture the panelist. Otherwise, the panelist received another $100. The challenger would then undertake the same process with one of the remaining panelists, while the champion attempted to capture the remaining panelist. For round two, starting with the challenger, each contestant attempted to capture the un-captured panelists. In this round, if a contestant failed, the panelist was given $200 (later avoiding a capture was worth $100, a total that increased to $200 if all three of the panelists were captured). Once all three panelists were captured, each contestant tried to capture one of their opponent's panelists until one contestant captured all three. The game limited the competition to ten questions (this total was nine, if the champion was ahead when all three panelists were first captured). The winner received $1,000 and, together with the panelist with the most money, advanced to the bonus round, the \\"Chase Around the Daisy.\\" The winning panelist kept his/her money, while the others each received $100 and remained on the panel until having played five games, or advancing to the endgame. If the two contestants were tied after twelve questions, the hostess asked a question with a numerical answer. The champion was required to provide a guess, and the challenger had to determine if the correct answer was higher or lower. If the challenger was correct, he or she won the game. If two panelists were tied, each panelist in turn read the winning contestant a statement. If either one fooled the contestant, that panelist received $100. Otherwise, the contestant received a $100 bonus. This continued until the tie was broken or until all questions were exhausted. At this point, the contestant closer to the left gave the first guess to the numerical question and the other determined if the correct answer was higher or lower. In the event that a tie existed between all three panelists, they were given ten seconds to write down their best guess to a question with a numerical answer. The winning panelist received an extra $100. Chase Around the Daisy The winning contestant and panelist played on a giant daisy structure consisting of eight petals, numbered clockwise from 1 to 8. The contestant started at petal #1 and the panelist started on petal #6. The host asked the contestant a series of true/false questions and the contestant advanced one petal for each correct answer, while the panelist advanced one petal for an incorrect answer. The contestant had to catch the panelist within a time limit: originally 50 seconds, later 45, and then 40. If the contestant succeeded he or she won a new car. If time ran out, the panelist won $100 of the contestant's $700 for each petal that separated them in whichever direction was the greater distance. Later, the contestant did not receive money for failing to capture the panelist. If the panelist caught the contestant due to too many incorrect responses, the game ended and the panelist received $1,400, which was later changed to a consolation prize. The panelist returned as the next game's challenger regardless of the outcome and contestants remained on the program until eliminated or until the bonus round was won.

It became a hit in New Orleans for Professor Longhair in 1964,Berry/Foose/Jones, Up from the Cradle of Jazz. University of Louisiana at Lafayette Press, 2009, p. 148. featuring a whistled first chorus in a rollicking blues piano style and subsequent lyrics written in mock-American-Indian pidgin (whistled and sung by King, uncredited). The tune became popular in New Orleans, frequently performed by local musicians such as Dr. John, and is now a staple of the repertory of most brass bands and musicians in the area. (Even though it was not a national hit, the single was available for years in the New Orleans area, especially during Mardi Gras.) King wrote the song while attending school, and recalled the tune during a recording session with Longhair arranged by Wardell Quezergue.\\"Meet De Boys\\". OffBeat, February 2010, p. 22. Longhair originally wanted to record the song with a small ensemble, but Quezergue, King, and Smokey Johnson (who also played on the session) convinced him to include an eleven- or fifteen-piece horn ensemble on the 1964 recording. The song refers to Mardi Gras Indian groups; an important part of the African American Mardi Gras tradition. The \\"Indian Nation\\" of Mardi Gras Indian \\"gangs\\" in New Orleans includes the Wild Magnolias, the Golden Eagles, and several others. Mardi Gras Indian gangs have existed since the early 20th Century. Each gang performs its own original songs and dances on Mardi Gras Day, on \\"Super Sunday\\" (the Sunday before St. Patrick's Day) and at other functions in the community. The \\"Big Chief\\", the \\"Spy Boy\\", the \\"Flag Boy\\" and several other roles or offices are important to the Mardi Gras Indian tradition of \\"masking\\" (parading through the street in full costume). These characters are mentioned in Earl King's song, as well as many other songs which have come out of New Orleans. According to tradition, the African Americans in New Orleans who first formed \\"Indian gangs\\" did so as a tribute to the Native American tribes in the area who took in runaway slaves in the pre-Civil War era. Mardi Gras Indians wear elaborate, hand made costumes which feature massive feather headdresses and intricate bead work. The song is sampled in the song \\"Knock 'Em Out\\" from Alright, Still, the debut album from Lily Allen.

Many Mongols had been proselytized by the Church of the East (sometimes called \\"Nestorian\\") since about the seventh century,Weatherford, p. 28 and some tribes' primary religion was Christian. In the time of Genghis Khan, his sons took Christian wives of the Keraites, and under the rule of Genghis Khan's grandson, M√∂ngke Khan, the primary religious influence was Christian. The practice of Nestorian Christianity was somewhat different from that practiced in the West, and Europeans tended to regard Nestorianism as heretical for its beliefs about the nature of Jesus. However, the Europeans also had legends about a figure known as Prester John, a great Christian leader in the East who would come to help with the Crusades. One version of the legend connected the identity of Prester John with a Christian Mongol leader, Toghrul, leader of the Keraites. When the Mongols conquered northern China, establishing the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), the Church of the East was reintroduced to China after a gap of centuries. As the Mongols further expanded, the Christian sympathies of the court, primarily through the influential wives of the khans, led to changes in military strategy. During the Mongols' siege of Baghdad (1258), many of the citizens of the city were massacred, but Christians were spared. As the Mongols further encroached upon Palestine, there were some attempts at forming a Franco-Mongol alliance with the Christians of Europe against the Muslims. Mongol contacts with the West also led to many missionaries, primarily Franciscan and Dominican, traveling eastward in attempts to convert the Mongols to Roman Catholicism.  Background  The Nestorian Stele in China, erected in 781 The Mongols had been proselytised since about the seventh century.\\"The Silk Road\\", Frances Wood, p.118 \\"William of Ribruk was shocked to discover that there were, indeed, Christians at the Mongol court, but that they were schismatic Nestorians (...) Nestorians had long been active along the Silk Road. Their existence in Tang China is testified by the \\"Nestorian monument\\", a stela still to be seen in the forest of Stelae in Xi'an\\"Foltz \\"Religions of the Silk Road\\", p.90-150For extensive detail and the testimony of Rabban Bar Sauma, see \\"The Monks of Kublai Khan Emperor of China\\", Sir E. A. Wallis Budge. Online Many Mongol tribes, such as the Keraites,\\"Early in the eleventh century their ruler had been converted to Nestorian Christianity, together with most of his subjects; and the conversion brought the Keraites into touch with the Uighur Turks, amongst whom were many Nestorians\\", Runciman, p.238 the Naimans, the Merkit, the Ongud,For these four tribes: Roux, p.39-40 and to a large extent the Qara Khitai (who practiced it side-by-side with Buddhism),Grousset, Empire, p. 165 were Nestorian Christian.\\"In 1196, Genghis Khan succeeded in the unification under his authority of all the Mongol tribes, some of which had been converted to Nestorian Christianity\\" \\"Les Croisades, origines et cons√©quences\\", p.74 Genghis Khan himself believed in traditional Mongolian shamanism, but was tolerant of other faiths. When, as the young Tem√ºjin, he swore allegiance with his men at the Baljuna Covenant around 1200, there were representatives of nine tribes among the 20 men, including \\"several Christians, three Muslims, and several Buddhists.\\"Weatherford, p. 58 His sons were married to Christian princesses of the Keraites clan who held considerable influence at his court. Under the Great Khan Mongke, Genghis's grandson, the main religious influence was that of the Nestorians.Under Mongka \\"The chief religious influence was that of the Nestorian Christians, to whom Mongka showed especial favour in memory of his mother Sorghaqtani, who had always remained loyal to her faith\\" Runciman, p.296 Some of the major Christian figures among the Mongols were: * Sorghaghtani Beki, daughter-in-law of Genghis Khan by his son Tolui, and mother of M√∂ngke Khan, Kublai Khan, Hulagu Khan and Ariq B√∂ke, who were also married to Christian princesses;Runciman, p.246\\"Sorghaqtani, a Kerait by birth and, like all her race, a devout Nestorian Christian\\", Runciman, p.293\\"His [Mongka's] principal Empress, Kutuktai, and many other of his wives also were Nestorians\\", Runciman, p.296 * Doquz Khatun, wife of Hulagu Khan and mother of Abaqa Khan,\\"This remarkable lady was a Kerait princess, the granddaughter of Toghrul Khan and cousin, therefore of Hulagu's mother. She was a passionate Nestorian, who made no secret of her dislike of Islam and her eagerness to help Christians of every sect\\", Runciman, p.299 who for his part married Maria Palaiologina, daughter of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1265. After the death of Abaqa's mother Doquz, Maria filled her role as a major Christian influence in the Ilkhanate. * Sartaq Khan, son of Batu Khan, who converted to Christianity during his lifetime;\\"Early in 1253 a report reached Acre that one of the Mongol princes, Sartaq, son of Batu, had been converted to Christianity\\", Runciman, p.280. See Alexander Nevsky for details. * Kitbuqa,\\"Kitbuqa, as a Christian himself, made no secret of his sympathies\\", Runciman, p.308 general of Mongol forces in the Levant, who fought in alliance with Christian vassals. * Yahballaha III, an Ongud Mongol earlier known as Rabban Marcos, became the Patriarch of the Church of the East from 1281 to 1317.Grousset, p.698 * Rabban Bar Sauma, a Chinese monk who made a pilgrimage from Khanbaliq (now Beijing) and testified to the importance of Christianity among the Mongols during his visit to Rome in 1287. * Nayan Khan, a Mongol nobleman and uncle of Kublai Khan. In 1287, after becoming increasingly angry with Kublai for being ‚Äútoo Chinese‚Äù, Nayan staged a rebellion. Since he was a nobleman and governor of four Mongol regions, Nayan had a significant army. He also allied with other Mongol governors who were themselves dissatisfied with Kublai's rejection of Mongol values, from their perspective. Nayan's battle standard had a cross on it because he was a Christian. Their rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, and Nayan was quietly executed. Practice Syriac, found in Issyk Kul, dated 1312 According to popular anthropologist Jack Weatherford, because the Mongols had a primarily nomadic culture, their practice of Christianity was different from what might have been recognized by most Western Christians. The Mongols had no churches or monasteries, but claimed a set of beliefs that descended from the Apostle Thomas, which relied on wandering monks. Further, their style was based more on practice than belief. The primary interest in Christianity for many, was the story that Jesus had healed the sick and survived death, so the practice of Christianity became interwoven with the care of the sick. Jesus was considered to be a powerful shaman, and another attraction was that the name Jesus sounded like Yesu, the Mongol number \\"9\\". It was a sacred number to the Mongols, and was also the name of Genghis Khan's father, Yesugei.Weatherford, p. 135 However, somewhat in contradiction to Weatherford, there is written evidence of a permanent Nestorian church in KarakorumWilliam of Rubruck, Journey, chapter 15 (Christians at the court of the Khan): \\"but I do know that they do not celebrate mass in a tent, but in a substantial [J: permanent] church.\\" and archeological evidence for other permanent church buildings in Olon S√ºmeTjalling Halbertsma, Nestorian remains of Inner Mongolia : discovery, reconstruction and appropriation, p. 88ff and Ukek.http://www.livescience.com/48433-city-ruled-by-genghis-khan-heirs.html The use of non-permanent (yurt) churches is also well-documented. Again according to Weatherford, the Mongols also adapted the Christian cross to their own belief system, making it sacred because it pointed to the four directions of the world. They had varied readings of the Scriptures, especially feeling an affinity to the wandering Hebrew tribes. Christianity also allowed the eating of meat (different from the vegetarianism of the Buddhists). And of particular interest to the hard-drinking Mongols, they enjoyed that the consuming of alcohol was a required part of church services.Weatherford, p. 29. \\"Jesus was considered an important and powerful shaman, and the cross was sacred as the symbol of the four directions of the world. As a pastoral people, the steppe tribes felt very comfortable with the pastoral customs and beliefs of the ancient Hebrew tribes as illustrated in the Bible. Perhaps above all, the Christians ate meat, unlike the vegetarian Buddhists; and in contrast to the abstemious Muslims, the Christians not only enjoyed drinking alcohol, but they even prescribed it as a mandatory part of their worship service.\\" Women in Mongolia were known to indicate their faith by wearing an amulet inscribed with a cross, or to be tattooed with a cross. Keraite and Naiman Christian tribes Mongol tribes that adopted Syriac Christianity ca. 600 ‚Äì 1400 The Keraite tribe of the Mongols were converted to Nestorianism early in the 11th century. Other tribes evangelized entirely or to a great extent during the 10th and 11th centuries were the Naiman tribe. The Kara-Khitan Khanate also had a large proportion of Nestorian Christians, mingled with Buddhists and Muslims. Depiction of the Keraite ruler \\"Wang Khan\\" (\\"King and Khan\\")Roux, p.107 Toghrul as \\"Prester John\\" in \\"Le Livre des Merveilles\\", 15th century. An account of the conversion of the Keraite is given by the 13th century West Syrian historian, Gregory Bar Hebraeus, who documented a 1009 letter by bishop Abdisho of Merv to the Patriarch John VI which announced the conversion of the Keraits to Christianity.Roux, L'Asie Centrale, p.241 According to Hebraeus, in the early 11th century, a Keraite king lost his way while hunting in the high mountains. When he had abandoned all hope, a saint appeared in a vision and said, \\"If you will believe in Christ, I will lead you lest you perish.\\" The king returned home safely, and when he later met Christian merchants, he remembered the vision and asked them about their faith. At their suggestion, he sent a message to the Metropolitan of Merv for priests and deacons to baptize him and his tribe. As a result of the mission that followed, the king and 20,000 of his people were baptized.Moffett, A History of Christianity in Asia pp. 400-401. The legend of Prester John was also connected with the Nestorian rulers of the Keraite. Though the identity of Prester John was linked with individuals from other areas as well, such as India or Ethiopia, in some versions of the legend, Prester John was explicitly identified with the Christian Mongol Toghrul. Relations with Christian nations Hulagu and his wife Doquz Khatun in a Syriac Bible Some military collaboration with Christian powers took place in 1259-1260. Hetoum I of Cilician Armenia and his son-in-law Bohemond VI of Antioch had submitted to the Mongols, and, as did other vassal states, provided troops in the Mongols' expansion. The founder and leader of the Ilkhanate in 1260, Hulagu, was generally favourable to Christianity: his mother was Christian, his principal wife Doquz Khatun was a prominent Christian leader in the Ilkhanate, and at least one of his key generals, Kitbuqa, was also Christian.Grousset, p. 581. A later descendant of Hulagu, the Ilkhan Arghun, sent the Nestorian monk Rabban Bar Sauma as an ambassador to Western courts to offer an alliance between the Mongols and the Europeans. While there, Bar Sauma explained the situation of the Nestorian faith to the European monarchs: Upon his return, Bar Sauma wrote an elaborate account of his journey, which is of keen interest to modern historians, as it was the first account of Europe as seen through Eastern eyes. Influence of Catholic Christianity Nestorian Christian Cross from a monastery of Fangshan District in Beijing (then called Dadu, or Khanbaliq), Yuan dynasty The type of Christianity which the Mongols practiced was an Eastern Syriac form, which had an independent hierarchy from Western doctrine since the Nestorian Schism in the 5th century. Over the centuries, much of Europe had become unaware that there were any Christians in central Asia and beyond, except for vague legends of a Prester John, a Christian king from the East who many hoped would come to help with the Crusades and the fight for the Holy Land. Even after contacts were re-established, there were still Western missionaries who proceeded eastward, to try and convert the Mongols to Roman Catholicism, away from what was regarded as heretical Nestorianism. Some contacts were with the capital of the Mongols, first in Karakorum and then Khanbaliq (Beijing) in Mongol- conquered China. A larger number of contacts were with the closest of the Mongol states, the Ilkhanate in what today is Iran, Iraq, and Syria. As early as 1223, Franciscan missionaries had been traveling eastward to visit the prince of Damascus and the Caliph of Baghdad.Roux, Les explorateurs, pp. 95-97 In 1240, nine Dominicans led by Guichard of Cremone are known to have arrived in Tiflis, the capital of Christian Georgia, by the orders of Pope Gregory IX. Georgia submitted to the advancing Mongols in 1243, so as the missionaries lived for five years in the Georgian realm, much of it was in contact or in close proximity with the Mongols. In 1245, Pope Innocent IV sent a series of four missions to the Mongols. The first was led by the Dominican Andr√© de Longjumeau, who had already been sent to Constantinople once by Saint Louis to acquire the Crown of thorns from Baldwin II. His travels are known by the reports of Matthew Paris. Three other missions were sent between March and April 1245, led respectively by the Dominican Ascelin of Cremone (accompanied by Simon de Saint-Quentin, who later wrote the account of the mission in Historia Tartarorum), the Franciscan Lawrence of Portugal, and another Franciscan, John of Plano Carpini. In 1253, the Franciscan William of Rubruck traveled to Karakorum, the western Mongol capital, and sought permission to serve its people in the name of Christ. He was received courteously, but forbidden to engage in missionary work or remain in the country. At one point of his stay among the Mongols, William did enter into a famous competition at the Mongol court. The khan encouraged a formal debate between the Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims, to determine which faith was correct, as determined by three judges, one from each faith. When William returned to the West, he wrote a 40-chapter document on the customs and geography of the Mongols. Armenian King Hethum I, Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William Rubruck visited Mongolia. Dominican missionaries to the Ilkhanate included Ricoldo of Montecroce and Barthelemy of Bologna, who later became the bishop in the Ilkhanate capital of Maragha. By the year 1300, there were numerous Dominican and Franciscan convents in the Il-Khanate. About ten cities had such institutions, including Maragha, Tabriz, Sultaniye, Tifflis, and Erzurum. To help with coordination, the Pope established an archbishop in the new capital of Sultaniye in 1318 in the person of Francon de P√©rouse, who was assisted by six bishops. His successor in 1330 was Jean de Cor.Roux, ‚Äò‚ÄôHistoire de l‚ÄôEmpire Mongol‚Äô‚Äô, p. 439 In 1302, the Nestorian Catholicos Mar Yaballaha III, who as a young man had accompanied the older Rabban Bar Sauma from Khanbaliq (Beijing), sent a profession of faith to the Pope. He thereby formalized his conversion to Roman Catholicism, though a 1304 letter from him to the pope indicated that his move had been strongly opposed by the local Nestorian clergy.Luisetto, p.99-100 Mongol-European contacts diminished as Mongol power waned in Persia. In 1295, Ghazan (great-grandson of Hulagu) formally adopted Islam when he took the throne of the Ilkhanate in 1295, as did Berke along with other Golden Horde leaders. In his own letters to the Mongol ruler in 1321 and 1322, the Pope still expressed his hope that the Mongol ruler would convert to Christianity. Between 500 and 1000 converts in each city were numbered by Jean of Sultaniye.Roux, Histoire, p. 440 By the 14th century, the Mongols had effectively disappeared as a political power. Catholic missions to Mongol China Polo remitting a letter from Kublai Khan to Pope Gregory X in 1271 In 1271, the Polo brothers brought an invitation from Kublai Khan to Pope Gregory X, imploring him that a hundred teachers of science and religion be sent to reinforce the Christianity already present in his vast empire. This came to naught due to the hostility of influential Nestorians within the Mongol court, who objected to the introduction of the Western (Roman Catholic) form of Christianity to supplant their own Nestorian doctrine. In 1289, Pope Nicholas IV sent the Franciscan John of Monte Corvino, who became China's first Roman Catholic missionary. He was significantly successful, translated the New Testament and Psalms into the Mongol language, built a central church, and within a few years (by 1305) could report six thousand baptized converts. But the work was not easy. He was often opposed by the Nestorians, whose style of Eastern Christianity was different from John's Western version. But the Franciscan mission continued to grow, other priests joined him and centers were established in the coastal provinces of Kiangsu (Yangchow), Chekiang (Hangchow) and Fukien (Zaitun). Following the death of Monte Corvino, an embassy to the French Pope Benedict XII in Avignon was sent by Toghun Tem√ºr, the last Mongol emperor in the Yuan dynasty of China, in 1336.Jackson, p. 314 The Mongol ruler requested a new spiritual guide to replace Monte Corvino, so in 1338, a total of 50 ecclesiastics were sent by the Pope to Peking, among them John of Marignolli. Two massive catastrophes hastened the extinction of this second wave of missionaries to China. Firstly, the Black Death during the latter half of the fourteenth century in Europe so depleted Franciscan houses that they were unable to sustain the mission to China. Secondly, the Mongol- created Yuan Dynasty in China began to decline. The native Chinese rose up and drove out the Mongols, thereby launching the Ming Dynasty in 1368. By 1369, all Christians, whether Roman Catholic or Syro-Oriental, were expelled. With the end of Mongol rule in the 14th century, Christianity almost disappeared in mainland Asia, with three of the four principal Mongol khanates embracing Islam.The Encyclopedia Americana, By Grolier Incorporated, p. 680 See also * Buddhism in Mongolia * Islam in Mongolia * Religion in the Mongol Empire Notes References and further reading      Mongol Category:7th-century Christianity ","title":"Christianity among the Mongols"},{"id":"13029199","text":"Hans Namuth (March 17, 1915 ‚Äì October 13, 1990) was a German-born photographer. Namuth specialized in portraiture, photographing many artists, including abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock. His photos of Pollock at work in his studio increased Pollock's fame and recognition and led to a greater understanding of his work and techniques. Namuth used his outgoing personality and persistence to photograph many important artistic figures at work in their studios. Namuth photographed many other painters such as Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, and Mark Rothko and architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Louis Kahn. Namuth focused on his rapport with his subjects, getting many reclusive figures such as Clyfford Still to agree to be photographed. Namuth's work not only captured his subjects in their studios with their works, but also captured the relationship between photographer and subject as well as the subjects' levels of self- consciousness. Besides famous art figures, Namuth photographed the Mam people of Todos Santos, whose native lifestyles were being overrun by Western influences. Namuth died in a Long Island car crash in 1990. Early life Hans Namuth was born March 17, 1915 in Essen, Germany. His interests in his youth were mainly politics and the arts. Namuth cites his mother as most responsible for encouraging his interest in music and the arts. As a teenager, Namuth became familiar with German expressionism and French impressionism through the Folkwang Museum. Namuth's father joined the Nazi Party in 1931 after becoming disillusioned due to an economic decline. This contrasted with the political views of his son, who found himself drawn to the liberal German Youth Movement. After Hans Namuth was arrested and briefly jailed for distributing anti-Nazi materials in July 1933, Namuth's father intervened and arranged for him to be sent to Paris. During his time in Paris, Namuth took an assortment of jobs including newspaper boy, researcher, and dishwasher. Namuth befriended many German expatriates in Paris, including photographer George Reisner. In 1935, Reisner invited Namuth to assist him with his studio in Port de Pollen√ßa, Spain, and introduced the 20-year-old Namuth to photography. After several months, the two returned to Paris, supporting themselves with photojournalism and occasional portraits. Namuth and Reisner were sent to cover the Workers' Olympiad in July 1936 by French magazine Vu, which put them in Barcelona during the opening stages of the Spanish Civil War. Over the next nine months, the two photographed the war, providing photos to European publications. Namuth and Reisner returned to Paris in 1937 and continued their careers as photographers until 1939. While in Paris, Namuth studied with Joseph Breitenbach, who taught him the technical aspects of photography. After increased tension and hostilities between France and Germany, Namuth and his fellow German expatriates were interned, though Namuth joined the French Foreign Legion to avoid his confinement. After being discharged in 1940, Namuth fled to Marseilles and escaped to the United States with the help of journalist Varian Fry and his Emergency Rescue Committee. He arrived in New York City in 1941 and planned to join the Office of Strategic Services in 1943 out of a desire \\"to do something about everything\\". However, he had fallen in love with French-born Guatemalan Carmen Herrera and delayed his enlistment until he was drafted for World War II in December 1943. After completing basic training, Namuth joined the intelligence services and worked as an interrogator and interpreter in England, France, and Czechoslovakia. Upon returning to Germany in 1945 to gather war criminals, Namuth realized, \\"I really had cut my navel cord completely and totally, not just with my home and family but with the country as such. I was completely out of it.\\" Namuth did not return to Germany until 1970. With the conclusion of World War II, Namuth left the army, having been awarded the Purple Heart and Croix de Guerre. Namuth returned to New York determined to raise enough money for his family while keeping photography as a hobby. After working for a paper research company for about a year and a half, the company went bankrupt, leaving Namuth without a job. Namuth realized he had been \\"doing something that really was not my dish\\", and decided to return full-time to photography. He set up his kitchen as a darkroom and began doing location work for architecture magazines, as he had been interested in architecture and design. Namuth was introduced to Alexey Brodovitch, a photographer, instructor, and art director of Harper's Bazaar. Namuth began taking Brodovitch's classes at The New School of Social Research, where he learned how to develop ideas and how to engage the concepts of his images from Brodovitch. He began working for Harper's Bazaar, doing fashion photography, and later children's fashion photography. Jackson Pollock One of Namuth's many photos of Jackson Pollock painting with his \\"drip\\" method. Hans Namuth was not initially interested in the work of Jackson Pollock, but was convinced by his teacher Alexey Brodovitch that Pollock was an important painter. In July 1950, Namuth approached Pollock and asked to photograph the artist working in his studio. Pollock agreed, encouraged by his wife, Lee Krasner, who was aware of the importance of media coverage. The resulting images helped to demystify Pollock's famous \\"drip\\" technique of painting, revealing it to be a deliberative process rather than a random splashing of paint. They \\"helped transform Pollock from a talented, cranky loner into the first media-driven superstar of American contemporary art, the jeans-clad, chain-smoking poster boy of abstract expressionism,\\" according to acclaimed culture critic Ferdinand Protzman. Not satisfied with black and white stills, Namuth wanted to create a color film that managed to focus on Pollock and his painting at the same time, partially because he found more interest in Pollock's image than in his art. His solution was to have Pollock paint on a large sheet of glass as Namuth filmed from underneath the work. As Namuth could not afford professional lighting, the film was shot outside Pollock's Long Island home. This documentary (co-produced with Paul Falkenberg) is considered one of the most influential for artists. In November 1950, Namuth and Pollock's relationship came to an abrupt conclusion. After coming in from the cold-weather shoot of the glass painting, Pollock, who had been treated in the 1930s for alcoholism, poured himself a tumbler of bourbon whiskey after supposedly having been sober for two years. An argument between Namuth and Pollock ensued with each calling the other a \\"phony\\", culminating in Pollock overturning a table of food and dinnerware in front of several guests. From then on, Pollock reverted to a more figure-oriented style of painting, leading some to say that Namuth's sessions robbed Pollock of his rawness and made Pollock come to feel disingenuous about doing things for the camera that he had originally done spontaneously. Art critic Jonathan Jones suggests that by filming Pollock, Namuth \\"broke the myth of trance\\" and by framing Pollock's work in the larger surrounding landscape, destroyed Pollock's view that his paintings were boundless. Jeffrey Potter, a close friend of Pollock's, described Namuth as commanding, frequently telling Pollock when to start and stop painting. According to Potter, Pollock \\"felt what was happening was phony.\\" Namuth himself describes Pollock as being \\"very nervous and very self-conscious\\" of the filming at the time, but less so when Pollock discussed it in a later interview. During his time with Pollock, Hans Namuth had created two films and captured more than 500 photographs of the artist. These photos were first published in 1951 in Portfolio, a journal edited by Alexey Brodovitch and Franz Zachary. After the death of Pollock in 1956, Namuth's photos grew in popularity and were often used in articles about the painter in place of Pollock's artwork itself. Art historian Barbara Rose states that the photographs changed art by focusing on the creation of art rather than the final product alone. Younger artists such as Bruce Nauman, Richard Serra, and Robert Morris were able not only to view Pollock's paintings, but, with Namuth's images, to see Pollock in the act of painting, giving rise to the popularity of Process Art. These photos have also allowed art historians to dissect the details of Pollock's method. For example, art historian Pepe Karmel found that Pollock's painting in Namuth's first black- and-white film began with several careful drippings forming two humanoid figures and a wolf before being covered beneath several layers of paint. Other artists The popularity drawn from his work with Pollock helped Namuth gain access to other members of the abstract expressionist movement including Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko. During the construction of de Kooning's studio over the years, Namuth photographed its progress as well as de Kooning's paintings from this period. Namuth took an especially large number of photos of de Kooning's Reclining Man, possibly indicating the painting's importance to Namuth or de Kooning. Namuth photographed many architects including Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Louis Kahn. Later work Namuth and his wife had first visited Guatemala in 1946 out of interest in his wife's native land and Namuth photographed the native Mam people of Todos Santos. Namuth returned in 1978 to survey the damage of an earthquake and was shocked to find the native customs of the Mam threatened by influences such as alcoholism. Namuth published these black-and-white photos in his 1989 book, Los Todos Santeros, in an effort to catalog and preserve images of the town's population and customs. He began to work regularly for Art News in 1979, producing 19 covers for the magazine over four years. Namuth died in 1990 in a Long Island automobile accident not far from where Pollock had similarly died in a car crash. The full archive of Namuth's work is located at the Center for Creative Photography (CCP) at the University of Arizona in Tucson, which also manages the copyright of his work.http://www.creativephotography.org/documents/CCP_HN.pdf CCP's \\"Conditions for Publication of Photographs by Hans Namuth\\" (PDF file) Subject interaction and technique Namuth found that the rapport he developed with his subjects was integral to making them feel comfortable being photographed while working. While Namuth was known to be a technically skilled photographer, his sociable and outgoing personality contributed largely to his notability in the New York art scene. Namuth was also persistent when persuading his subjects to agree to be photographed, including sculptor Joseph Cornell, who took two years to be convinced. He generally managed to put his subject at ease well enough so that they could work naturally in their environments without any artificial stiffness. Largely because of this, self- conscious artists such as Clyfford Still and Saul Steinberg agreed to be subjects for Namuth's photography. However, critic Sarah Boxer suggests that it is difficult to view photos of such artists without considering the possibility that they were trying to gain fame in a manner similar to Pollock. Though Namuth developed personal relationships with many of his subjects, art critic Hilton Kramer describes Namuth as \\"something of a hero worshiper.\\" Namuth's photographs included objects related to his subjects, such as paint tubes, items from around their homes, and their works of art. His photos also captured his own interactions with subjects, showing how comfortable they were at the time of shooting. Some subjects, such as Frank Stella, seemed to be intoxicated with the idea of being photographed by Namuth, while others, including Mark Rothko and Robert Rauschenberg, ignored Namuth during their photo sessions. Other photographs exude tension between photographer and subject, as if Namuth were an unwelcome guest in their workspace, as in the cases of artists Louise Nevelson and Jasper Johns. Often, Namuth's subjects are uncomfortable in front of the camera, as were architects Eero Saarinen and Buckminster Fuller. Almost all of Namuth's images of male artists, with the notable exception of Pollock, appear to be taking contemplative or otherwise self-absorbed poses.Jones, C. (1996), p.32.

The Lectures cover an array of topics‚Äî\\"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace\\"‚Äîdemonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.McLachlan, 255. Priestley offers a version of history in which all events are \\"an exhibition of the ways of God;\\" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, \\"leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will.\\"Qtd. in McLachlan, 258. Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This millennial outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.Sheps, 138. Priestley's millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: Edward Gibbon's decline narrative found in the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and David Hume's cyclical narrative found in his History of England.Sheps, 140. The philosophical underpinning of Priestley's millennial view of history was David Hartley's theory of association laid out in Observations on Man (1749). Hartley's associationism, an expansion of John Locke's theories in Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690, postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was \\"associationism.\\" For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world travelled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously \\"thinking.\\" These \\"associations\\" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting \\"a foolish maid\\" convince a child that \\"goblins and sprites\\" are associated with the darkness, for \\"darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other.\\"Locke, John. An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Ed. Roger Woolhouse. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357. Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is \\"perfectible\\" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8. Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding, he wrote: \\"certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men.\\"Qtd. in Watts, 89. He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.Watts, 89‚Äì90. Priestley also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He contended that much could be learned from \\"material evidence\\" of former civilisations, such as \\"ancient coins, medals and inscriptions,\\" as well as \\"exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction.\\"Sheps, 141.Schofield, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.

In 2002, the company underwent a restructuring whereby it moved its domicile to the Cayman Islands and established Noble Corporation as the parent holding company. In early 2009, the company moved its domicile from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland due to the potential for more U.S. taxes on Caribbean tax havens. In 2013, the company moved to the United Kingdom. In 2010, the company acquired Frontier Drilling in a $2.16 billion cash transaction. The company was added to the S&P; 500 Index in 2011 but was removed from the index in 2015. In 2014, the company distributed its interests in Paragon Offshore plc to its shareholders.

The Chart of Biography covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's \\"principle of selection\\" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning all of the people listed to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. Machiavelli is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and Cicero is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; \\"statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers.\\"Sheps, 144.McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.

It is found in open grasslands in Africa. They are gregarious seed-eaters with short, thick, red bills. They are very terrestrial, with lark-like feet and claws. Systematics Previously, three species were recognized, but are now considered subspecies: * Black-chinned quailfinch, Ortygospiza atricollis gabonensis * African quailfinch, Ortygospiza atricollis fuscocrissa * Black- faced quailfinch, Ortygospiza atricollis atricollis The locust finch, Paludipasser locustella, is considered a member of this genus by some taxonomists. Two issues are contentious: First, whether the locustfinch should be included here or given its own monotypic genus. Second, the \\"African quailfinch\\" complex might comprise one or three species. The two-species arrangement as found in most field guides and used by the IUCN, was recently shown to be based only on a single character (the color of the chin and throat). It is certainly erroneous, being contradicted by all other morphological, behavioral and DNA sequence data. The molecular data would support a two-species arrangement with the taxa O. atricollis and O. fuscocrissa, but this is not supported by the other data. In conclusion, either O. gabonensis should be merged back into O. atricollis, or O. fuscocrissa should be restored to species status. Gene flow in the \\"African quailfinch\\" complex is still ongoing, and the three lineages therein either form a superspecies, or can be considered a single, wide-ranging and very variable species.Payne & Sorenson (2007) References * Clement, Peter; Harris, Alan & Davis, John (1993): Finches and Sparrows: an identification guide.

In the book, published in 1993, Shatner interviews several cast members of Star Trek: The Original Series with the notable exception of James Doohan. He was surprised by the reaction of his fellow actors, who spoke negatively of their experiences with him on the show. Contents The book begins at the start of production on Star Trek: The Original Series, with the work on the original pilot, \\"The Cage\\", and described the difficulties that some of the producers' decisions caused the production. Shatner goes on to describe the production of the show, and the aftermath of its cancellation. He interviews other members of the cast who on occasion speak negatively of their experiences on the show, except for James Doohan, who refused to meet with him. He also spoke to Bjo Trimble, one of the most famous Star Trek fans. Production William Shatner in 2014 The negative reaction of some of the cast members to him when he wrote Star Trek Memories had come as a surprise to Shatner, and it was reported at the time that he was dismayed at the response. He conducted the interviews by phone in some cases, including the one with Trimble. One of the stories included in the book, which involved Shatner putting out a fire on the Paramount lot, was directly contradicted by George Takei in his autobiography To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei. Instead, Takei said that when the fire broke out, Shatner was driven by public relations executives to the site of the fire and posed with a hose for photographs. However, while Star Trek Memories contains a description of an incident while filming \\"The Naked Time\\" that Shatner described as Takei getting carried away with an √©p√©e and nearly disembowelling him ‚Äì Takei's book instead makes no mention of it. Preview excerpts of the book were published in the September 4 issue of TV Guide magazine in the United States. It was published in the autumn of 1993, followed in 1994 with Star Trek Movie Memories.

He played for numerous ethnic Ukrainian amateur and professional clubs in both the U.S. and Canada over a twenty-year career. He also earned five caps with the U.S. national team between 1957 and 1963 and was a member 1956 U.S. Olympic soccer team. Youth While born in Putiatynsi, Snylyk's family moved to the city of Lviv where they lived until World War II. After the war, the Snylyk family fled to Mittenwald, West Germany where they lived in a displaced persons camp from 1945 to 1949. While there, Snylyk attended a Ukrainian secondary school and played several sports, becoming noted for his skill at table tennis. In 1949 when he was fifteen, Snylyks' family moved to the United States. They settled in Rochester, New York where he attended Ben Franklin High School. After graduating from high school, he entered the University of Rochester. College Snylyk attended the University of Rochester where he was a member of the school's soccer team from 1951 to 1954. He was an honorable mention (third team) All-American in both 1953 and 1954. Snylyk graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1955 and was inducted into the University of Rochester Hall of Fame in 2005. In addition to graduating from Rochester in 1955, he also gained his U.S. citizenship that year. He earned a master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1958. After graduating from Chicago, he taught political science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada in the 1959‚Äì1960 school year. Club career Snylyk began his organized soccer career with a team his father founded in Rochester, the Ukrainian American Sports Association of Rochester (also known as the Rochester Ukrainians). He would play with the Ukrainians from 1950 to 1955, then again in 1957. In 1957, the Ukrainians lost, 1‚Äì0, to St. Louis Kutis in the National Amateur Cup final. Over the years, he played for multiple teams, at time traveling by plane to make games in both Canada and the United States. In 1955, Snylyk joined the Montreal Ukrainians following the completion of Rochester's season. He then played in Montreal until 1957, when he joined Rochester for its run to the Amateur Cup final. Montreal finished league runner up in 1955 and champion in 1957. At times Snylyk would play simultaneously for teams in the U.S. and Canada. While he could do this due to the off set seasons, at times he was forced to travel from one game to another by airplane. For example, while playing for Montreal Ukrainians, Snylyk also played with Chicago Levy in 1956, then from 1958 to 1961. At some point in there, he also played for Toronto Ukrainians and while teaching at McGill University of Montreal in 1959‚Äì1960, he would fly to New York to play games with the New York Ukrainians. In 1962, Snylky moved to Newark, New Jersey to manage a newspaper. While there, he signed with Newark Ukrainian Sitch (also known as Chornomorska Sitch) of the American Soccer League (ASL). He remained with this, his last club, until his retirement in 1970. In 1963, Sitch won the ASL League Cup, known as the Lewis Cup. Olympic team Beginning a year after he gained his U.S. citizenship, Snylyk began representing the U.S. at the international level. In 1956, he was selected to be the captain of the U.S. soccer team which competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics. The U.S. took a tour of Asia in preparation for the games. Despite good success at these friendly matches, the U.S. lost, 9‚Äì1, to Yugoslavia in the first round. Pre-1956 Olympic Games tour * Japan 3‚Äì5 U.S. * Kansei 0‚Äì6 U.S. * South Korea 1‚Äì0 U.S. * Taiwan 1‚Äì6 U.S. * Hong Kong 2‚Äì1 U.S. * Philippines 0‚Äì4 U.S. * Singapore 1‚Äì2 U.S. * Indonesia 7‚Äì5 U.S. In 1959, Snylyk was again selected as captain of the U.S. soccer team as it entered qualification for the 1960 Summer Olympics. This time a loss and a tie to Mexico in the first round of qualification put the U.S. out of contention for the tournament. In 1964, Snylyk was called into his third consecutive Olympic soccer team, but again the U.S. failed to qualify for the tournament with a 1‚Äì2 record in qualifications. Pan American Games In the 1950s and 1960s, most players on the U.S. national team were amateurs. This allowed them to play both in full internationals and in the Olympics and Pan American Games which were fully amateur at the time. In 1959, Snylyk was selected for the U.S. soccer team at the 1959 Pan Am Games, held in Chicago. Just as with the Olympic squad, Snylyk was team captain of the U.S. as it captured the bronze medal in these games. On August 29, 1959, the U.S. defeated Brazil 5‚Äì3. However, this was also Snylyk's wedding day. He played the game, then drove, along with his teammates, to the church where he married Yara Matura, a native of Chicago. Following the reception, he went back to the competitors' compound to sleep. Snylyk competed in the 1963 Pan Am Games. However, the U.S. was not as successful, finishing last and losing 10‚Äì0 to Brazil in the process. National team Snylyk earned five caps with the U.S. national team from 1957 to 1961. In 1957, he played two World Cup qualification games. The first, a 6‚Äì0 loss to Mexico took place on April 7, 1956. On November 13, 1960, he was team captain as the U.S. lost 3‚Äì0 to Mexico in Mexico City in a World Cup qualifier. His last cap came as a substitute for Kenneth Finn in a 2‚Äì0 loss to Colombia on February 5, 1961. Newspaper editor In 1962, the Ukrainian National Association hired Snylyk to edit The Ukrainian Weekly. He remained as editor until 1980. That year, he became the editor of the Ukrainian-language newspaper, Svoboda. He retired in June 1988. Snylyk died on January 21, 2002, at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.Staff. \\"Zenon Snylyk, former editor of The Weekly, Svoboda, passes away at age 69\\", The Ukrainian Weekly, February 4, 2002.

Profitable growth is aimed at seducing the financial community; it emerged in the early 80s when shareholder value creation became firms‚Äô main objective. Profitable Growth stresses that Profitability and Growth should be jointly achieved. It is a break from previous firms‚Äô development models which advocated growth at first to achieve economies of scale and then profitability (see BCG Growth-share matrix).  The Profitable Growth Paradox  Profitable Growth hides in fact a contradiction in terms, one often speaks of the Profitable Growth paradox. Most growth investment will at first reduce the profitability, cost reduction efforts to boost the bottom line usually have a negative impact on future growth. This is especially true with mature products or services. The only way out of the Profitable Growth paradox is through innovation. It concerns not only technical innovation but mainly business model innovation, a new product-market space where there is no competition (see Blue Ocean Strategy). An interesting piece of research by the BCG shows that no business model is able to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage for more than 10 years.  Economic Profitability  Economic Profit is the residual wealth calculated by deducting the cost of capital from the firm‚Äôs operating profit. It is defined as: Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) - Cost of Capital Employed \\\\- NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) NOPAT = EBIT x (1 - Tax Rate) NOPAT measures a company's potential cash earnings. \\\\- Capital Employed Capital Employed is the amount of funds which has been used over the period by the company to generate the NOPAT. There are 2 ways to measure Capital Employed (CE) : \\\\- CE = Shareholders‚Äô Equity + Net Financial Debt Net Financial Debt is computed as: interest bearing Debt ‚Äì Cash and Cash equivalents. \\\\- CE = Fixed Assets + Net Working Capital Net Working Capital is usually computed as: Account Receivables + Inventories ‚Äì Account Payables. Both definitions lead to the same measure of Capital Employed. One prefers the first one when computing Capital Employed at the firm level; the second one is more practical when focusing on a company‚Äôs business unit.

Genesis of work Priestley's friends urged him to publish a work on the injustices borne by religious Dissenters because of the Test and Corporation Acts, a topic to which he had already alluded in his Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life (1765). Between 1660 and 1665, Parliament passed a series of laws that restricted the rights of dissenters: they could not hold political office, teach school, serve in the military or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they ascribed to the thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. In 1689, a Toleration Act was passed that restored some of these rights, if dissenters subscribed to 36 of the 39 articles (Catholics and Unitarians were excluded), but not all Dissenters were willing to accept this compromise and many refused to conform. Throughout the 18th century Dissenters were persecuted and the laws against them were erratically enforced. Dissenters continually petitioned Parliament to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, claiming that the laws made them second-class citizens. The situation worsened in 1753 after the passage of Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act which stipulated that all marriages must be performed by Anglican ministers; some refused to perform Dissenting weddings at all.Schofield, Vol. 1, 202-5 In order to defend Dissenters, the text rearticulates John Locke's arguments from the Two Treatises on Government (1689), but it also makes a useful distinction between political and civil rights and argues for protection of extensive civil rights.Garrett, 17; Tapper, 315. Priestley distinguishes between a private and a public sphere of governmental control; education and religion, in particular, he maintains, are matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. As Kramnick states, \\"Priestley's fundamental maxim of politics was the need to limit state interference on individual liberty.\\"Kramnick, 18. For early liberals like Priestley and Jefferson, the \\"defining feature of liberal politics\\" was its emphasis on the separation of church and state.Schofield, Vol. 1, 209-10; Jackson, 100-1; Uglow, 169; Kramnick, 20. In a statement that articulates key elements of early liberalism, Priestley wrote: > It must necessarily be understood, therefore, that all people live in > society for their mutual advantage; so that the good and happiness of the > members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great > standard by which every thing relating to that state must finally be > determined.Qtd. in Gibbs, 40 and Uglow, 169; Tapper, 315. Priestley acknowledged that revolution was necessary at times but believed that Britain had already had its only necessary revolution in 1688, although his later writings would suggest otherwise. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon individual freedom.Tapper, 315. Essay on Government went through three English editions and was translated into Dutch.

She was voted out in 1989, but elected again in 1993. The following year she left the LDP and joined the Japan Renewal Party, which merged into the New Frontier Party on 10 December 1994. The NFP torn up on 31 December 1997, Oogi became a member of the Liberal Party, stringing along with Ichir≈ç Ozawa. It was in 2000 that Oogi came to the forefront. She founded the Conservative Party, renamed the New Conservative Party soon, and became its first leader in April. Prime Minister of Japan Yoshiro Mori appointed Oogi as Minister of Construction and Director General of the National Land Agency in July, and also as Minister of Transportation and Director General of Hokkaido Development Agency in December. When these ministries and agencies merged into the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport as a result of the administrative reform of 2001, Oogi was installed as its first minister. She drew the nameboard displayed at the entrance of the building of the ministry with black ink and a brush. The New Conservative Party's debacle at the House of Councillors election in July 2001 heightened calls among party members for a change in leadership. Oogi resigned as party leader and was succeeded by Takeshi Noda on 17 September 2001. Oogi joined the Liberal Democratic Party in 2003 again. She was installed as the 26th President of the House of Councillors on 30 July 2004. She attended at the World Conference of Speakers of Parliaments held by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in September 2005.United Nations Photo: World Conference of Speakers of Parliaments by IPU In October 2006 she made an official visit to China.CCTV International - The President of the House of Councilors, Chikage Oogi arrive In May 2007, Oogi announced her retirement from politics in July so that she could lead an ordinary life with her family., Sankei Shimbun, 11 May 2007 Her term of office expired on 28 July 2007.  Political views   Constitution  Oogi has critical views against the Constitution of Japan of 1947. She has said that the constitution has many problems such as ignoring environmental rights, obfuscating the Self-Defense Forces and its international contribution to keep peace, and excessively protecting criminals while making light of crime victims' human rights. She also made a controversial remark: \\"The Constitution of Japan deprived Japanese women of their graces of character.\\"Sankei Shimbun, 3 May 2000  Transfer of capital functions  A suggestion to transfer some capital functions out of Tokyo came under review in 1990s to solve the problem posed by overconcentration of people in Tokyo. Oogi, who was Minister of Construction in charge of this issue, expressed opposition to the transfer in September 2000. Her opposition created conflicts with Prime Minister Mori and with the mayors of the candidate cities.Mainichi Shimbun Morning Edition, 8 September 2000  Imperial succession  Upon Prince Hisahito's birth in September 2006, Oogi suggested that the lawmakers take a cautious attitude toward the Government's move to allow female and matrilineal succession of the Imperial Throne. She appreciated Princess Akishino for her third deliverance in this day of declining birthrate and said \\"We women would like to look to her as a model.\\"Mainichi Shimbun Morning Edition, 7 September 2006  Haneda Airport  In 2000, Oogi proposed that Haneda Airport expand international air service. Narita Airport, which almost monopolized international flight service to Tokyo, is so distant from central Tokyo that there has long been a strong call among Tokyoites and Yokohamans for international air service of Haneda Airport. Oogi's proposal was welcomed by Shintaro Ishihara, Governor of Tokyo.Yoshiko Sakurai, \\"Opinion: J≈´≈ç Mujin\\", Weekly Diamond, 24 February 2001  Personal life  Oogi has two sons, Tomotaro and Hirotaro.

Townshend was the second son of George Townshend, 2nd Marquess Townshend, and his wife Charlotte (n√©e Loftus). He was returned to Parliament as one of two representatives for Tamworth in 1812, a seat he held until 1818, and again between 1820 and 1835. He was initially elected in the family interest, when his family owned Tamworth Castle, but could not expect to continue in 1818 after the Townshend trustees had sold the castle, but was defeated when Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, the owner of Drayton Manor in nearby Drayton Bassett and his son William canvassed against him. However he was re-elected unopposed in 1820.History of Parliament Townshend died in November 1853, aged 68, having previously repurchased Tamworth Castle.

Talpade lived in Mumbai and studied Sanskrit literature and the Vedas.  Early life and inspiration  Talpade was born in the Chira Bazaar neighborhood of Mumbai, Maharashtra, in a Pathare Prabhu family. He completed his school education in Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. During his time there he came to know about stories describing ancient Indian aeronautics through his teacher Chiranjilal Verma, who led Talpade to read Dayanand Saraswati's works related to ancient aeronautics, such as ‚ÄòRigvedƒÅdic BhƒÅshya BhumikƒÅ‚Äô and ‚ÄòRigved and Yajurveda BhƒÅshya‚Äô. Some sources also suggests that his works were based on the work done by Maharishi Bharadwaja in the Rigveda. Inspired by these texts he decided to construct the Vedic VimƒÅna described in the Vedas, and started learning Vedic Sanskrit language. Talpade's aircraft Talpade's aircraft was named MarutsakhƒÅ, derived from the Sanskrit Marut ('air' or 'stream') and sakhƒÅ ('friend') which together mean 'Friend of wind'. As suggested by D. K. Kanjilal's 1985 Vimana in Ancient India: Aeroplanes Or Flying Machines in Ancient India, MarutsakhƒÅ is supposed to have been inspired from VimƒÅna, ancient flying-machines in Hindu epics. He states that the contemporary reports in the MarƒÅthi-language newspaper Kesari attested to the purported flight, however the article on it was written only in 1952. Contemporary accounts of a successful flight or evidences of such an achievement do not exist and the technical feasibility is dubious. The technical basis of the Vedic Ion Design which was supposedly used by Talpade has been debunked by research into the technological feasibility of such flights. Various versions suggest he used a kind of urine or mercury as fuel. One of Talpade's students at the art school, Shripad Damodar Satwalekar, wrote that MarutsakhƒÅ sustained flight for a few minutes. According to K.R.N. Swamy \\"a curious scholarly audience headed by a famous Indian judge and a nationalist, Mahadeva Govinda Ranade and H H Sayaji Rao Gaekwad, respectively, had the good fortune to see the unmanned aircraft named as ‚ÄòMarutsakthi‚Äô take off, fly to a height of 1500 feet and then fall down to earth\\". Mahadev Govind Ranade and Sayajirao Gaekwad III were also said to be present during the flight test. Pratap Velkar in \\"Maharashtracha Ujwal Itihaas\\" however contradicts such claims, stating that \\"It wasn't a well-publicized event. It was more like a sporting event. Apart from a few curious onlookers, the only people present were some friends who had showed up to watch him.\\" Moreover, Valjar states that MarutsakhƒÅ was apparently a cylindrical structure made of bamboo and filled with liquid mercury. The contraption was supposed to fly when the mercury reacts with sunlight to release hydrogen, which is lighter than air. But, according to Velkar, the plane did not get very high or stay up too long; it rose to a small height and crashed within minutes. A former Indian defense scientific officer, D. H. Bedekar, stated in 2004 that MarutsakhƒÅ failed to operate to its full design limits due to technical reasons. According to Siddhartha Deb \\"No one knows what this unmanned plane looked like, although if one goes by the illustrations in the V.S., it could have resembled anything from a mechanical sparrow to an upside-down flowerpot with small propeller.\\" After the experiment, MarutsakhƒÅ apparently was stored at Talpade's house until well after his death. Velakara quotes one of Talpade's nieces, Roshan Talpade, as saying the family used to sit in the aircraft's frame and imagine they were flying. There are various versions of where the plans went‚Äîaccording to one it was taken by Rallis Brothers, which is owned by Tata Sons, or Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. Talpade's documents were taken by G. H. Bedekar, who worked with the Ministry of Defence and some passed on to HAL, though the aviation historian Anuraddha Reddy was unable to find them. Bedekar refused to share Talpade's documents but stated that they show that he was unsuccessful. The VaimƒÅnika ShƒÅstra states that he had tried to build an aircraft but was unsuccessful. Popular culture A film based on life of Talpade, Hawaizaada, starring Ayushmann Khurrana, was released on 30 January 2015. The film was earlier titled Bambai Fairytale.
